B007IXWKUK|5.0|You will not be able to put this book down, it's a must have.  I suggest buying the complete trilogy.  The only negative is the lack of sleep you encounter as a result of non stop reading.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Playing on Kindle Fire...graphics are great and puzzles are varied and fun. There's plenty to keep me happy. I recommend!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was surprised to find so many negative reviews....maybe I am out of the literary loop but I found this book to be a real finger slider (no pun intended)on my kindle fire! This book brought me right back to my wild, carefree younger days when I was willing to explore and play out fantasies!  I found myself immersed and reliving the past again and it was wonderful, I finished the book in a day....9 hours to be exact. I felt ANA's pain, by the time I was finished...I was exhausted : )
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|As children, Chris and Emily were as close as brother and sister.  As teens, they become boyfriend and girlfriend.  Now, as they enter into adulthood, their relationship has taken a darker turn.  No one is sure what killed Emily, and Chris, the only one who knows, isn't giving any answers.<br /><br />I'm probably not the best person to review a Jodi Picoult book because I have a real love/hate relationship with her novels.  On the one hand, she writes compelling fiction that always leaves me guessing.  On the other hand, her prose can be so overblown and her characters so histrionic and quixotic that I end up rolling my eyes.<br /><br />Although I've enjoyed a number of Picoult books, such as My Sister's Keeper, this one just didn't do it for me.  This was an earlier work of hers, and I think that's the reason why I didn't like it.  The characters were so unpredictable and the plot so ludicrous that I could hardly stand to read the final few chapters.  Maybe a dyed-in-the-wool Picoult fan would enjoy this book, but I certainly didn't.
B0088TG252|3.0|this mirrored the Bourne movies too closely . . . agent stuck in the middle of action, woman leader trying to find him, rogue internal agent giving away the secrets. And of course the CIA is the corrupt agency . . . tired of the same old

B007VT6QSI|3.0|Justin Bieber is a pretty easy target.  Let's face it, a very boyish 15-year-old storms the pop music scene and instantly amasses legions of preteen fans that shower him with adoration to an almost insane degree....a situation that's just ripe for parody.  The result of this is that Bieber is judged more for what he represents than what he actually does.  You can lament the \\"death of good music\\" at the hands of today's pop starlets all you want, but the truth is that this kind of thing has been said for decades.  Now, Mr. Biebs is 18 and has released his third full length album, Believe.  And the truth is that while it's not the end-all-be-all of pop music, it's FAR from the worst pop album released this year.  This coming from someone who in no way considers himself a \\"Belieber\\".<br /><br />Believe delivers exactly what you'd expect from pop music in 2012: familiarity, sparkly-clean production, dance beats, the word \\"girl\\" thrown in every few seconds, autotune, Max Martin, and the obligatory guest appearance by Nicki Minaj.  So you're really not going to hear anything new or revolutionary.  What you WILL hear is some new territory for Bieber himself.  His last two releases (not counting the Christmas album) were pretty much for a niche audience.  My World and My World 2.0 oozed with preteen appeal, where Bieber's lack of age overshadowed every single aspect of those records.  Believe is a chance for Bieber to introduce himself to mainstream audiences now that his voice has deepened and now that he's hired some decent producers.  For the most part, he succeeds in crafting a sugary mix of pop and R&B.  And while most of it is just okay, it does have some surprises.<br /><br />One of those is the opening track, \\"All Around the World\\".  A fierce club-stomper, this track really took me aback at its boldness and its infectious beat.  It obviously owes its existence to Britney Spears' similar-sounding \\"Till the World Ends\\" from her Femme Fatale album, but it sounds greatnonetheless.  First single, \\"Boyfriend\\" was the perfect choice for a lead song.  It's reminiscent of Justin Timberlake with Mike Posner's competent production values.  The lyrics could be a little better (\\"I could be your Buzz Lightyear fly across the globe...\\", really?), but it's progress in the right direction.  The dubstep-inspired \\"As Long as You Love Me\\" is another standout track.  And finally, Michael Jackson influences are extremely numerous.  The title track, \\"Believe\\", which is actually one of the strongest moments on the album, reminds of Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\".  Second single \\"Die in Your Arms\\" actually samples one of Jackson's early recordings (\\"We Got a Good Thing Going\\").  And no Michael Jackson comparison would be complete without pointing out \\"Maria\\", the closing track of Believe's deluxe edition.  This song is based on Mariah Yeater, who is the woman who claimed that Bieber fathered her child.  Naturally, the song takes cues from Jackson's \\"Billie Jean\\", but the production from Rodney Jerkins (who actually produced Michael Jackson's later material) seems to be lifted directly from Jackson himself.  Vocally, the song even sounds like MJ and wouldn't sound out of place on HIStory or Blood on the Dance Floor.  It's a cheeky homage, one that Bieber even acknowledges.  But despite the blatant inspiration, it really does stand out as the best track on this album.<br /><br />On the flipside, most of the other tracks are nothing more than filler.  After a strong start, the record slows down both in tempo and in its ability to draw your attention.  Sappy pop ballads pepper the tracklist, but to be perfectly fair, this is what his fans want.  And in the end, what we have is a capable pop album that neither thrills nor disappoints.  Bieber's growth as an artist is pretty evident...now for next time, if he could only pioneer pop music instead of sliding into the same tried-and-true formulaic sound, we might have something truly special.
B0015D3YX6|5.0|A CLASSIC!  A must have, nothing else to say but I'll blather on anyway.  I would think they couldn't do it again if they wanted to, if not for the later live stuff.  Arthur Lee was impossibly alien cool and his talent was undeniable.  He was not afraid of cheese, but in its context that didn't matter much.<br /><br />Accused of copying Hendrix, it just wasn't so.  Who cares?
1400032717|4.0|After reading these many reviews, it seems to me that any work of fiction that can rouse such emotional responses has to be good a thing. Those who think Christopher's character presents autism unfairly, might be inspired to educate via non-fiction, and those who think his character resembles someone they know/love, might gain some new understanding of kids we call \\"special-needs\\". For people like me, it was just a fascinating tale of three people at cross purposes striving to overcome different obstacles.<br /><br />I found Christopher and his parents empathetic. I can't imagine being locked in Christopher's world, and I can't imagine being locked in the parent's world either. All three behave badly, all three are motivated by reasons of their own---and the beauty is the contrast behind their motivations. Christopher makes poor choices by relying on logic alone, the parents make poor choices based on emotion alone. What a great juxtaposition. Both positions are extreme, and both deny the characters what they really want and need.<br /><br />I understand some viewers when they say Christopher lacked empathy, but I think the writer disproves this with Christopher's love of animals.<br /><br />POSSIBLE SPOILER:<br /><br />The only part of the novel that truly bothered me was the mother's letters to her son. Apart from being a little \\"As you know, Bob\\", they struck me as cruel----but I don't believe that was the writer's intention. IMHO the mother redeems herself later on, but for some, perhaps a little too late.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to friends. The writing alone makes it worthwhile.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I only bought this book because of all the hype and because it was leading the book rating charts.  It is horrible.  Lots of talk shows and reviews indicate that submissive relationships are what women desire but this is nothing short of physical and psychological abuse.  Three main concerns:  the story line is ridiculous and poorly written;  I'm afraid that it will spur on abuse by men who believe this is what women want;  I am afraid that it will encourage women to submit to self-esteem lowering relationships.  I also felt totally ripped off - when I buy a book, I expect it to have a beginning, middle, and end for one price.  This tricks you into buying a full price book that only has the beginning - and you have to spend two more full-priced books to learn the middle and the end.  NO.  I won't do it, especially when it is so disturbing to read.  DO NOT BUY.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|After forty years and twenty albums, it's clear that Rush has carved out a unique and enduring place in popular music history.  It's true that Geddy Lee's voice is a bit of an acquired taste, but apart from that, it can hardly be denied by anybody that Rush is one of the most accomplished, influential, and successful rock groups ever.<br /><br />And this may be their best album yet...I would even go so far as to say that it's quite possibly the greatest rock album of all time.  And I'm not just saying that as some hardcore fan who thinks everything they do is the greatest (I actually thought their last album, Snakes & Arrows, was just okay---at least by Rush's standards).  So let me try to give some indication of what makes it so great.<br /><br />While the songs generally stand quite well on their own, Clockwork Angels is best understood as one long multi-part epic.  It tells the story of a young man living in a future society ruled by a Watchmaker dictating every aspect of the citizens' lives, and the young man's quest to forge his own path.  It's probably the greatest dystopian sci-fi rock vision since Tubeway Army's Replicas, or Rush's own 2112 (and the position of the clock hands on this album's cover is a clever inside reference to that earlier one).<br /><br />More specifically, Clockwork Angels is a steampunk reimagining of Voltaire's Candide (how cool is that?!), complete with a voyage to a new world (\\"far across the Western Sea\\"), a journey to find a city of gold, disaster and shipwreck, the works.  The final track, \\"The Garden\\", makes the connection explicit.<br /><br />But rather than merely satirizing Leibniz's Optimism or Rationalistic philosophy in general, the album examines some aspects of these ideas more deeply and offers a more specific alternative.  The Watchmaker of the story is a reference to an omnipotent and omnipresent deity, and the \\"clockwork angels\\" are the agents of such a god conceived as a celestial watchmaker (hence the album's title).  The title track states this idea succinctly: \\"Lean not upon your own understanding / Ignorance is well and truly blessed / Trust in perfect love, and perfect planning / Everything will turn out for the best.\\"<br /><br />But against this, the album is mainly about personal freedom and creating one's own destiny.  From the opening track's line, \\"Going where I want, instead of where I should\\"---to the opening lines of \\"Headlong Flight\\", about looking back with satisfaction at both the good and the bad in life: \\"All the journeys / Of this great adventure / It didn't always feel that way / I wouldn't trade them / Because I made them / The best I could / And that's enough to say\\"---and its refrain, \\"I wish that I could live it all again.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Rush interprets Candide's rather obscure reference to \\"tending our garden\\" as a metaphor for our relationships with our fellow human beings in the closing track's chorus: \\"The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect / So hard to earn, so easily burned / In the fullness of time / A garden to nurture and protect.\\"  This is a beautiful song, and as many others have noted, if this turns out to be Rush's last studio album, they will have gone out on a high note.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are excellent too, musically as well as lyrically.  From the hard-driving, almost heavy-metal steampunk riff of \\"BU2B\\", to the more lyrical acoustic sound of Alex Lifeson's guitar in \\"Halo Effect\\", Geddy Lee's incredible bass line in \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" and his vibrant vocal melody in the chorus of \\"The Wreckers\\" (reminiscent of the best songs from Presto).  The album feels like a summation of the best of Rush's work spanning their entire career.<br /><br />Neil Peart said of Clockwork Angels in an interview about a year ago while the album was in progress, \\"I intend it to be my highest achievement lyrically and drumming wise.\\"<br /><br />He succeeded.).  The title track states this idea succinctly: \\"Lean not upon your own understanding / Ignorance is well and truly blessed / Trust in perfect love, and perfect planning / Everything will turn out for the best.\\"<br /><br />But against this, the album is mainly about personal freedom and creating one's own destiny.  From the opening track's line, \\"Going where I want, instead of where I should\\"---to the opening lines of \\"Headlong Flight\\", about looking back with satisfaction at both the good and the bad in life: \\"All the journeys / Of this great adventure / It didn't always feel that way / I wouldn't trade them / Because I made them / The best I could / And that's enough to say\\"---and its refrain, \\"I wish that I could live it all again.\\"<br /><br />Finally, Rush interprets Candide's rather obscure reference to \\"tending our garden\\" as a metaphor for our relationships with our fellow human beings in the closing track's chorus: \\"The measure of a life is a measure of love and respect / So hard to earn, so easily burned / In the fullness of time / A garden to nurture and protect.\\"  This is a beautiful song, and as many others have noted, if this turns out to be Rush's last studio album, they will have gone out on a high note.<br /><br />The rest of the songs are excellent too, musically as well as lyrically.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|After reading a number of reviews of Fifty Shades of Grey, I must admit that I don't understand what all the hullabaloo is about? Is it thought provoking? Yes. It is laughable? Only for those who have no understanding of the myriad of ways to express love/lust.<br /><br />To me the story is not about the erotic scenes, it is about the underlying driving forces of the two main characters, Anastasia and Christian. While we are privy to Anastasia's makeup (the story is told by her in the first person), Christian remains a complex mystery not only to Anastasia but to the reader as well. We are given glimpses of what his early life was like - born to a mother who was addicted to crack. We also meet his adoptive family who he refers to as 'the perfect family'. These are the first clues to what drives him.<br /><br />Yes, Christian is controlling. Yes, Ana is naive. Yes, each has their own agenda. And as the story weaves it's way through the Red Room I found myself feeling sorry for both of these characters, one who can't sustain a relationship unless he is dominant to the Nth degree and the other who wants only hearts and flowers but will do whatever it takes to keep the man she loves.<br /><br />This is an in-depth character study of the human persona with a good deal of erotica thrown in. Not for the faint of heart certainly. But in no way did I find it laughable nor pornographic. I've read many a romance novel where there are certainly more explicit adult scenes than this book offers.<br /><br />Based on many reviews I was prepared to dislike this book. But the writing is crisp, concise, and moves the story along. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I liked this book quite a lot. At the conclusion, I found myself wanting to learn more about these characters. I look forward to reading the next installment.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Having recently gone back and watched this movie, I can honestly say. This movie deserves more than five stars, I was reminded of the serials of the 30's and 40's. Like \\"Spy Smasher\\" and \\"The Phantom\\". Some people say Jude Law was overacting, well in a moving like this. Which is an obvious homage to those serials, guess what. Overacting is expected, this movie is pure popcorn fun, I won't go into the plot since that's already been done a thousand times. I was surprised to see the Titanic make an appearance in this movie, again I liked it. I wish they would make a sequel, and just like Spy Smasher. Sky Captain saves us from the evil Doctor, Or was the evil doctor behind it all. You'll have to get the movie to find out, I can assure you. You won't be disappointed.
0596522347|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book and being challenged in how we present both our own image as a presenter and also that of the organisation we represent.  Slide:ology gave me some new ideas on how to visually present content that is often complex in a simpler format.  The book gives some excellent examples of before and after slide designs and how some of the big companies design their presentations.  Slie:ology also gives a great insight into the fact that a great presentation is no accident and takes time to design, create and refine. This book never claims to be a book on learning PowerPoint and this is true.  It is a book on how to design and layout presentations in a smarter and clearer format.  The book is worth a read if you are looking to be challenged and want to improve the power of your presentation visuals.

If you cant find something that interests you on this tuner...frankly it doesnt exist.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This is the movie that \\"Expendables\\" should have been, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich. Play former black ops CIA agents, who are retired. Until, a hit quad arrives to kill Frank. Played by Willis, that scene alone blows the entire expendables movie out of the water. Frank kills the  hit squad, and goes to assemble his team. So they can find out why they're being targeted, is it over the top, Yes. But unlike expendables, the group acts like a group, each one of them has a speciality. Mirren's Victoria is an assasin, Malkovich's Marvin is Crazy, they play it for laugh's. And Willis is this movie is a beast, the fight scene between him and the Cia agent trying to kill him in the office. Is just brutal, and it show's why you don't mess with the Elderly. Even when one of them dies, it's done respectfully, I highly recommend this movie it's millions times better than expendables, better acted. Better written, just overall better.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Fairly typical, formula-like, ghost-in-a-house story except that it had enough twists and surprises to keep you engaged. Usual special effects of ghostly images in the usual places (dark hallways, basement, cemetery) with appropriate sounds and music with very effective sudden scene shifts with sound to frighten the unwary viewer. Beautiful location, authentic sets and props; one of the best I've seen for this genre. Very good acting, dialogue, characterizations, editing and cinematography. Attention to detail is usually a good indicator of a well crafted movie and the studio fulfilled that obligation to the highest degree. Surprising ending  so don't read any spoilers.
0439023521|5.0|I have to say this book is pure Genius! I mean I could not put it down! It is one of the best books i have every read. When i first heard about it i was a little iffy but then started reading it and realized it wasn't about the killing, sure that played a major role but really its about the life of Katniss its just, not words acan explain it all! You will be thinking about this book for months! I recommend that you read it! you will not be disapointed!
B0082KPF32|5.0|There's a reason why Ne Oblviviscaris have been generating buzz on various metal sites and blogs, having left a lasting impression with their demo, The Aurora Veil.  Not many bands have two vocalists, even fewer with guys who can sing as well as Tim Charles or Xenoyr, while the addition of Charles' violin is a nice change of pace for a heavy metal band.  Sure, other bands may have violin every once in a while, but there aren't many that have a violinist in their lineup, My Dying Bride and Winds being the other bands that come to mind.  Like those two bands, Ne Obliviscaris doesn't break out the violin too much, since the instrument tends to take the lead unless it's deliberately buried in the mix.  However, the violin is one of the elements that makes Ne Oblviscaris' music stand out.<br /><br />In the five years that have passed since the demo's release, the band has reworked those three songs, dropped a few other songs and worked on new material.  Though there are only four new tracks on Portal Of I, they and the new versions of the three previously released songs make for quite an enjoyable album.  However, I must admit that I prefer the earlier version of \\"As Icicles Fall\\", which I thought was the highlight of the demo; the vocals aren't quite as good, the guitars are lacking the sound they had before (even if they re playing the same thing) and the violin doesn't sound as prominent.  \\"Forget Not\\" sounds different, but I don't think the changes to the song make it any better or worse than the original, while \\"Tapestry of the Starless Abstract\\" is greatly improved, although I still think it's the weakest link here.  Of the new tracks, \\"Xenoflux\\" and \\"And Plague Flowers the Kaleidoscope\\" are the better half, but that's not to say \\"Of The Leper Butterflies\\" or \\"Of Petrichor Weaves Black Noise\\" are bad songs.<br /><br />With half of the year still to go, it's hard to say for certain, but Portal Of I will likely be considered a strong contender for album of the year and it wouldn't surprise me if a few sites, blogs or metal magazines do end up giving that honor to Ne Obliviscaris.

B004SIP7AS|3.0|I saw this movie when it first came to theaters and loved it. I thought it was very well done and Paltrow did a fantastic job. Northam was a perfect Knightley to me back in the day and I watched this again and again. Once I read the novel I realized how much was left out but as an adaptation I believed they did the best they could. Fast forward to present day and I just watched this again with a bit of a different reaction. I didn't realize before how inappropriate some of the characters behaved. Knightley, gentlemanly as he was alleged to be, would not be slouching in chairs and roughly grabbing Emma (as Northam does in the scene where Knightley scolds Emma for being rude to Bates). Was a gentleman (even a brotherly one) allowed to physically handle a lady while yelling at her? That scene just completely sat wrong with me. Much of this movie is a bit too cutesy, too modern, although dressed up in period pieces and making an attempt at truncated Austen dialogue. It doesn't really fit, in the end. For the proper behavior, watch A&E's Pride and Prejudice. That one will definitely transport you to the Regency era. It's a perfect Austen adaptation. As for this version of Emma, it isn't horrible, although it is not exactly faithful to the novel. It's fluffy, Paltrow comes off as a bit dim and cutesy and Emma is supposed to be extremely clever, just misguided. Paltrow wrinkles her brow in adorable confusion but that's about the extent of the depth she gives her Emma. And Toni Collette comes off even worse, though she has Harriet's sweetness down. I didn't sense any growth in Emma because the whole Fairfax storyline is barely there and I recall being completely confused by it the first time I saw this. It's far more of a plot point in the book and seemed crammed into this movie at the last moment. What's most distracting is the modern way the characters interact, with the slouching and the touching and how about the last kiss after the proposal? Yikes. If you're the type who doesn't so much care about faithfulness to the time period, as I was as a twenty-something) you won't mind it, but if you notice these things, it will distract you. I also notice many recommendations for the Kate Beckinsale version, which I also saw but only once a long time ago. I was biased towards this version and absolutely hated it.....I didn't like Mark Strong as Knightley at all and considered it a punishment for Emma to end up with him. I don't know if that opinion would be different now that I see this version's flaws more clearly.

0618871713|4.0|The beginning of this book seemed promising, and I particularly loved the author's father's penchant for Victorian decorating. She spends a lot of time describing the decor in the rooms of the house, and how much it stood out from the houses of her friends. The story is very much about the father, who she never really knew during his life, and has quested to discover after his mysterious death. Bechdel examines many minute details of conversations with her father, and the way their relationship paralleled those of characters in the novels he loved.<br /><br />Fun Home is well-written and entertaining, but I did not have an emotional connection to the characters because I did not relate to them. They were amusing, but what I read did not resound with me.
B000002KHY|4.0|James Taylor achieved great success as the 70's resident folk/pop troubador.  With his smooth, somewhat gravelly, voice and his gentle easygoing tunes, he found a niche in the eclectic seventies, spilling over to the self-serving eighties.<br />This first collection of hits exemplifies his knack for writing and recording radio-friendly tunes.<br />Highlights for me:  the poignant SOMETHING IN THE WAY SHE MOVES; the autobiographical FIRE AND RAIN, Carole King's classic YOU'VE GOT A FRIEND; the bluesy DON'T LET ME BE LONELY TONIGHT; WALKING MAN, my favorite JT composition; and the shamefully infectious sentiment of SHOWER THE PEOPLE.  JT is joined by then-wife Carly Simon, Graham Nash and David Crosby, Andrew Gold and Joni Mitchell for tasty vocal harmonies.<br />It's a pleasant compilation of some of his biggest hits and still enjoyable in this decade.

030788743X|5.0|It could be because I grew up playing games on the Intellivision and the Commodore 64, and it could be because I'm from Columbus, or the fact that I enjoyed World of Warcraft, but for me, Ready Player One is outstanding entertainment. It is as addictive as any video game and has just as much replay value.<br /><br />The story concerns Wade Watts, user name Parzival, an overweight, poor, and nerdy video game enthusiast who wants to win the OASIS contest. OASIS is a completely immersive console game that many people use as a second life, a way to be the person they cannot be in life. The creator of the OASIS has just died, and he willed his $240 billion fortune to the first person to find the series of Easter eggs in the OASIS. After five years, no one has even found the first part, but that is all about to change. And the results of the contest seem steeped in the favor of the Sixers, the nickname for the employees of an oppressive company that wants to mold the OASIS to suit their desires, which would keep poor players like Parzival out.<br /><br />Since the creator of the OASIS grew up in the 80s, and the seekers of the fortune have made the decade second nature in hopes of using the knowledge to win, this book is packed with references from music to games to movies like Wham!, Joust, Dig Dug, PacMan, WarGames, Star Wars, Revenge of the Nerds, The Breakfast Club, Back to the Future, Highlander, Ghostbusters, Risky Business, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Red Dawn, Beastmasters, Night Rider, etc. If you like any of these, you'll love this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Every woman should read this, and any man wanting to please his woman to the fullest, in all ways.  Its an aazing story of trust.
B006ZPJWBM|3.0|Too much has been written and said about his Duet Albums.<br />The fact is that, at his age, Mr Bennett cannot make a 'solo' album: his voice is still good but weak and strained, at times.<br />The BIG idea was the \\"DUETS\\".<br />In a duet, the singer/crooner shares the vocal weight and duties with another singer, so the job is easier and, in a sense, it distracts the listener, who is pleased to hear who's who is singing, not really caring too much about the singing quality.<br />That says it all.<br />With no offence, Mr Bennet is not able to make it alone, at this point in time.<br />Like for \\"The Voice\\", the Duets Albums are for Bennett the lowest point of a twists-and-turns, long albeit admirable discography.<br />They have to do MORE with the 'discovered' glamour and the commercial side of a career than with excellency of a veteran singer's vocals.<br />It has been since 2006 that Mr Bennet has not recorded a solo album.<br />The last one was \\"Perfectly Frank\\", on which Tony Bennett pays homage to \\"the Voice\\".<br />And even before that, there was \\"Playin' with My Friends: Bennett Sings the Blues\\", his truly 'first' duet album: the duet partners included ten singers who range from Diana Krall and k.d. lang to Ray Charles, B.B. King, and Kay Starr, and younger pop stars Stevie Wonder, Bonnie Raitt, and Billy Joel. Utterly bland and forgettable were the duets with usual suspects Natalie Cole and Sheryl Crow.<br />On \\"Duers II\\", apparently the selection of the partners was a very calculated and commercial one as reported by Boston Globe's James Reed : \\"My son (Danny) really checked out who are the very most popular artists at this moment\\", Bennett says, reclining on a sofa surrounded by his paintings in his artist studio that overlooks New York's Central Park...\\"Partly the brainchild of Bennett's son and manager, Danny, the \\"Duets\\" series is a calculated project that transcends genres and generations. On the new album, Bennett gives a masterclass to pop stars (LadyGaga, John Mayer), country belters (Carrie Underwood, Faith Hill), popopera singers (Andrea Bocelli, Josh Groban), and a Spanish rocker (Alejandro Sanz). Bennett even enlists other icons for memorable collaborations, including Aretha Franklin and Willie Nelson\\".<br />The result, as a whole, is good, not great, from the 'vocal' point of view.<br />\\"Now, at 85, Bennett is still singing great. Not quite like he was, of course - who could? - but still pretty amazingly good, even if some of his spot-on vocals might be (but probably aren't) courtesy of his engineer younger son, Dae...<br />On \\"Duets II\\", Bennett picks up where he left off on the first Duets album a few years ago by inviting younger talents to share the spotlight with him on some old standards...The charts are pretty good, though they don't rival much of what Bennett did with Ralph Sharon decades ago, or what Nelson Riddle did with Sinatra or even Linda Ronstadt. And the engineering and recording quality are just, well, different than the old days, though Dae Bennett 'pays homage to his father' better than anyone else might be able to\\". R Moore<br />There's no disputing that Mr Benedetto, whose career spans more than six decades, boasts a fine body of work. It's also fair to say that his golden years are now behind him : there's little more dispiriting than the sound of ageing stars frantically chasing after their lost youth.<br />Which makes it all the more distressing that, after some very distinctive playing ( with his standard group, the Ralph Sharon Trio, Basie or Bill Evans ) he has gone into a very poppish, supercommercial, highly hyped adventure like this CD.<br />People are not aware, they buy only what they see on TV... As seen on TV!<br />And right now the very spirited Mr. Bennett is everywhere! Talk show, morning show, evening show, late night show... Grammys, Oscars ! Every day!<br />And now, voilà !<br />At the end of a spectacularly expensive campaign, started 5 years ago, we see the release of a DVD: \\" Duets II - The Great Performances\\".<br />Everything has been calculated and programmed till the smallest detail : the duets sessions were filmed by Oscar-winning cinematographer Dion Beebe (\\"Chicago,\\" \\"Memoirs of a Geisha,\\" \\"Collateral\\")...<br />There's nothing wrong with that, the DVD is worth watching it once.<br />Still we are wondering WHY this DVD has not been released along with the album.<br />Cash-in exercise or...enduring vanity?

B0076UXKDG|1.0|With a D300 & D700 (both with MB10s), I was seriously considering upgrading to two D800s until I saw the price of the new MB12.  I initially thought, Wow, this must have some powerful new improvements, like maybe a small 'fridge for soft drinks and beer! I hope somebody at Nikon reads all these reviews.  I'm waiting until either the price comes down or someone else makes a reasonably-priced aftermarket alternative before purchasing the D800s.  No SALE!  No Way!
B0064NTZKI|5.0|A comprehensive review of the career and films of Woody Allen which has obviously been lovingly created and benefits from rare access to Woody to hear his thoughts and views and look over his shoulder as he re-visits his childhood homes and the streets wher he grew up. This, the full length television documentary rather than the shorter cinema released version, is more rounded and does access some of Woody's thoughts and his views on life. Really enjoyed it

1433530848|5.0|The ESV Study Bible Personal Size exceeded my expectations.  Initially I was a skeptic of the ESV version (not another version!)  But after hearing so much about it and particularly about the ESV Study Bible, I decided to give it a try via the kindle (for $8 it was worth trying - even if I still didn't like the ESV I had the study notes) [By the way the Kindle edition is 5 star.  It is easy to navigate and find where you need to go (if you read the directions first. It's my go to kindle Bible now.]<br /><br />After spending about a month comparing my preferred versions (kjv, nkjv mainly, and nasb for verbs)to the ESV Study Bible I found that I really liked it.  It was a happy marriage between the two.  I appreciated the conservative, reformed perspective and that they gave a nod to other manuscripts which the kjv and nkjv are based on.<br /><br />So I ordered the ESV Study Bible Personal Size.  LOVE IT!  The size is very manageable.  The trade off is smaller print (which I can still manage easily but I know in a few years I may need a magnifier) and the loss of the articles at the end of the Regular size study bible (however you have free access to them online and they are also included in the Kindle ESV Study Bible as well)  The notes are excellent and I agree with what most have said about the treatment of different points of view and the reformed leaning (which I like).  One feature I really like which I didn't have in my other study bible is the inclusion of maps right where you need them -- in the study notes where you are reading (there are also full page maps at the back).  So rather than flip back and look at the map I can just drop down and see a little more of the context.  Also, the use of color is refreshing throughout and helpful in charts. The whole layout is very \\"user-friendly\\".<br /><br />The binding quality is so nice.  I decided on trutone because everyone seemed to agree it was a viable alternative to the \\"genuine leather\\" that is used on many Bibles.  The pictures do not do this Bible justice.  (if you want to see a more realistic picture try evangelicalbible site)It feels very nice in hand and is simply beautiful.  The binding is, as many know, smyth sewn which is much more durable for a book one plans to use daily. Crossway also gives a lifetime guarantee on their genuine leather and trutone Bibles.  That says it all.<br /><br />As suggested by others I thumbed through to make sure there were no blurred pages and happily there were none.<br />The only thing which I feel may be of concern to other users would be the size of the print and also the matter of being able to see the print on the other side of the page [I can ignore it and it doesn't bother me, but another person may see that as important--in which case there are Bibles(Legacy - not study bible)by crossway (and I am sure others)which align the print on both sides to minimize show through.]<br /><br />I am very very happy with the quality and content of the ESV Study Bible Personal Size and I definitely recommend it!
0345803485|5.0|WOW!  Am I GLAD I bought this at The Love Revolution sex shop in Ashland, Oregon.  I am more than half-way through that book.  EL James knows what she's talking about!  This is a romantic story about an inexperienced young woman, Anastasia Steele, falling in love/lust with a very kinky young business entrepreneur named Christian Grey.  The details of the BDSM scenes are fabulous.  From what little experience I have, I can say the contract and Ana's first few \\"experiences\\" are VERY right-on-the-ball.  Both she and Christian are very human!  As well as very hot and sexy!  I must say, BDSM aficionadoes do love to collect their \\"toys\\"!  A very wonderful read!  Highly recommended to all BDSM-curious as well as those already in that lifestyle.  Thank you for such a sexy, dripping-wet you-know-where kinda book!
6305910340|4.0|I have this movie on a VHS format and will be upgrading to a DVD at some point in the future.  Yes, the movie has been dramatized by Hollywood in an attempt to keep the non-chess players in the audience interested.  Being a tournament player myself I can tell you that the last moves in the film between Josh and Jonathan were rushed, like speed chess, and, unless they both were in a time crunch they would never have moved that fast. Slow and methodical wins the day.  Lawerence Fishburn's character was a composite of at least two other influences in Young Josh's life.  Props to Ben Kingsley's acting as the American chess master, Bruce Pandolfini.  However, the real pandolfini is also an advocate of speed chess and probably, also a lover of a variant of that game called \\"Bug House.\\"  The real Bruce P. does show up in a small cameo in the film as the young, mustached spectator watching young Jonathan playing the former Russian Grandmaster in the park.  His line to both Kingsley and \\"young Josh\\" is \\"Another Bobby Fisher.\\"  All this aside, the feeling of what it's like to play in an actual tournament is shown very well.  Joe Mantagna's acting as the senior Waitzkin is very well done; my favorite bit with him was when he took on Josh's public School teacher over \\"this Chess thing.\\"  If you play serious chess then this movie is a great choice.
0062197258|3.0|This was a fast paced read. Slightly confusing at first jumping back and forth in time.<br /><br />The handling of domestic violence and OCD was well done. I believe I've gained insight into the mind and actions of the victim. Looking at abuse from the outside, it's easy to say, just leave him, but this story develed into her mind and how she delt with the abuse and her friends reactions.<br /><br />That said, I never really connected with Catherine. She's a party girl out every night with her friends, getting drunk and picking up guys. When she finds herself in a relationship that devolves into abuse, not a single friend believes her. Why? How can your best friend of many years not even hesitate to believe you? If even your best of friends don't believe you, what does that say about your character?<br /><br />Once she's away from that relationship, she doesn't develop any qualities to attract another love interest, and yet the author hooks her up. I could believe the friendship between the two, his from a professional standpoint, but there is nothing there for him to fall in love with.<br /><br />If you want insight into OCD, and the mind of an abuse victim, this is a good read for you.

0099579936|5.0|This book was boasted by so many others, I had to read it.  From the moment I started, I couldn't stop reading.  I will admit that some of the lines are a little.. oversaid, but the story line and believable characters are what keeps you there.  There isn't a dull moment in the book and one scene leading right into the next.  It keeps you wanting to know what is up next for these two.  Although some may think this is a violent relationship, I clearly didn't think that.  Because she was warned and told she had free will to accept or walk away, she had full power.  In every relationship there is a give and take of \\"power\\" and willingly giving it to someone you trust does not make for an abusive relationship.  You must read with an open mind to enjoy the story, otherwise, don't read this.  Sometimes it can be fun to read about unorthodox relationships and because you don't agree...that doesn't make it poor writing.  Get lost in this story and you will not be sorry!

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is awesome! Even for a person like me who is really out of shape and just started lifting. This book really explains how lifting works, and how building muscle works. Even if you are really out of shape like I am this book will help you. I learned so much about lifting, and I even started the one year challenge at the end of the book, and I feel it.. I love how straight forward the book is, and just tells you what you need to do lose weight and gain muscle.Awesome book 5 stars.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This is a great app! If you love owning shops, or food, or any other of the Story apps, then you will love this game! You get decorate your restaurant, visit other restaurants, tip others, visit others, select the foods for your restaurant and invite friends to your neighborhood. The cons are that you have to buy the cool things ( but there is a parental control for this)  and that gems are hard to come by. Have fun!

B007IQX1G4|4.0|This movie did have it's laughs and definitely related to my life since I'm currently a \\"young adult\\".  I'm not sure how funny it would be for people who haven't experienced this time in their life yet, although I'm sure they'd still get a few laughs from it.
B007ZRZF8I|1.0|This game was terrible. I regretted downloading it as soon as I played it. Luckily, I got a special deal so it was free. So why was it terrible? The answer, gameplay. There is only one control. Touch. You touch to defy gravity and walk on the ceiling touch again to walk on the ground. If you choose the wrong one, you either fly off into space, or get shot by an alien in a battle suit that looked like a clone trooper. Absolutely mind numbing. I got bored after about five minutes. On top of that, the game suffered from a complete lack of story-line (I mean, I don't even know why the alien is trying to shoot me!) and some bad graphics. I played it on my Kindle Fire, which usually has high-end graphics, and they were still pretty bad. I don't know what the makers of this app were thinking when they originally listed it at ninety-nine cents. This game has lousy gameplay, bad graphics, and about a million drawbacks. All in all, it is a fail of epic proportions. Do not buy it.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I was a big fan of the original Quell, but I was afraid that Quell Reflect would not measure up.  I am glad to report that this is not the case.  This was even better than the original.  The rules and the vibe of the game remain the same, and the puzzles are just right in terms of difficulty.  Sometimes they seem fiendishly hard, but before long you can figure out how to complete them.  Then you rack your brain a little harder, and with a sudden flash of insight you can find the optimum solution.  Hoping for a 3rd installment of Quell to come out soon.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|My family loves watching this movie!  It's a fun movie and clean for kids.  It's nice to see such a \\"despicable\\" guy find his good side. :)
B007VT6QSI|5.0|I have been a fan, but this album just reminded me why. Justin is growing up and it is evident in this album. He went above and beyond for this one.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|I have never purchased a Beach Boys cd, and I was just a bit nervous.  Aren't these guys really old, I thought?  I was concerned how much their voices had possibly worsened from the songs I used to hear on the radio. Still, for some reason, I was really excited for this record.<br /><br />Verdict?  This is an awesome album!  No old people around here; these guys sound incredible.  The beautiful multi-layered harmonies are present, and so are the hooks.  I just can't stop singing and humming, especially the title cut.<br /><br />Several reviewers have stated that they felt the Beach Boys were too old to be singing some of the material on the cd.  I guess they want to hear songs about enlarged prostates and hip replacements.  Judging by the reviews and the sales of \\"Radio\\", it seems that most of us are enjoying this delightful record.  If the Boys are having fun, and they sound great, then why are their ages relevant?<br /><br />I know a lot of people have been impressed by the last three songs of the album, but I love it all. From the opening harmonies of \\"Think About the Days\\" and \\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\", the album starts with a bang (not a loud one)and keeps going.<br /><br />I am happy for these guys because this album is a real triumph. \\"Radio\\" is not just a good record for a group the age of the Beach Boys; it is a  great record for anyone.  The album just has that wonderful classic sound of their former hits.  I honestly can't believe how good they sound.  If you close your eyes, you can almost imagine that they (and we) have never aged, and that the world is still somehow like California was just a few decades ago...<br /><br />I hope that the Boys will release more music, but this album adds to their legacy and is a really nice way to celebrate the upcoming 50th anniversary of the band.<br /><br />Nice job, guys.  Thanks for making my radio sound sooo good!<br /><br />EDIT:<br />June 22, 2012.  I love this album so much I bought \\"Sounds of Summer - The Very Best Of The Beach Boys\\".  It has 30(!) songs, about half of which were new to me.  I made a playlist for my ipod of \\"Radio\\" and \\"Sounds\\" mixed together, and it is amazing how well the new stuff fits right in with the hits.  I was impressed by the continuity over 50 years.<br /><br />Finally; if you liked the Beach Boys songs you have heard on the radio, you will love \\"Sounds Of Summer.\\"  If you don't already own it, buy BOTH.
B005FISBTO|5.0|I have seen all of the episodes of Dexter chronologically, and, in my opinion, this season and the fourth season were the two best to date. Colin Hanks and Edward James Olmos do a great job of acting, the story arcs and plot lines are smooth and consistent throughout the show, subplots are well developed with other characters keeping much more relevant and interesting stories than in some of the other seasons, and the themes and motifs of religion are a refreshing change and transition from the fatherhood/family ones that were beginning to grow rather stale. Additionally, there are lots of interesting character developments that occur, as well as underlying plots that should transition into later seasons well (should all of the stories continued to be developed in later seasons-- I hope they will, as this is something that producers hinted at during the commentary/special features on this season).<br /><br />My Rankings:<br /><br />--- BEST ---<br /><br />A. Tie between Seasons 4 & 6 (Trinity Killer & Doomsday Killer),<br /><br />B. Season 2 (Bay Harbor Butcher) ***Most narrow gap between the remaining seasons in terms of favoritism is between Seasons 2&5<br /><br />C. Season 5 (Julia Styles/Barrel Girls/Self-Help Gurus)<br /><br />D. Season 1 (Ice Truck Killers/Back Stories)<br /><br />E. Season 3 (Miguel Prado Story) ***Widest gap between seasons in terms of favoritism is between Seasons 1&3<br /><br />--- WORST ---

0307730697|5.0|Just finished the book and am still drying my eyes. What an incredibly inspirational story. Navy Seals are the most elite warriors in the world, but Adam Brown was someone truly special.<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading about Adam's wife Kelley. I have so much respect for her in the many ways she supported her husband and stuck with him through the darkest times of his life. What a courageous woman.<br /><br />I feel privileged to have glimpsed a part of Adam and Kelley's lives after reading this book. Thank you to the Brown family for sharing Adam's story.
0345803485|3.0|Not as good as all the hype I heard about it for weeks. It is a ok read however, at times can get boring. Its more of a romance novel then porn in book form. Also the main character \\"Ana\\" was not all that believeable, she sounded like a 40 year old woman trying to sound 20. The book is not what I thought but oh well I have bought all three now so I will read them.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I am of the opinion that Galaxy Quest is the best Star Trek movie ever made. Yes, it is a parody, but that frees it to celebrate the best things about Star Trek and space opera sci-fi while allowing it to neatly skewer the ridiculous aspects.<br /><br />Redshirts instantly reached the same level with me. Despite ostensibly being about the eponymous doomed extras, the book is more about lazy scriptwriting. Why does a space station have a stock of harpoon-shooting killer robots? Why is the vital but dire warning in code? Why does nobody warn the pulse-gun armed security team that the local life forms are immune to pulse guns? The characters find out the answers, in a parody (and this is the important bit) cleverer than the silliness it mocks. The author weaves an entertaining and well-plotted tale of struggle and survival in the not-so-illustrious low ranked characters as the characters desperately try to dodge away missions filled script-contrived certain but irrational death, at first by luck, and later with a dash of genre-savvy - and more luck.<br /><br />The book is easy to read, and it rewards a single-sitting read through.

0451232577|5.0|I see a lot of negative reviews on this book - but I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />I guess it comes down to what you want from a book. For me, I enjoyed the fictional parts as a pretty good story, and I loved the factual, historical, details that fill the book. I found myself not only learning a lot of interesting info from the book itself, but also being prompted to go look up more history online. For me, that made this a great read, and I look forward eagerly to the next installment
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is so fun. i play it almost every day. i will definatly recommended it. a little expensive, but defintly worth it. great grafics, new adventures, and lots of plants. prepare to meet your doom zombies :)
0385523912|5.0|This book was truly amazing.  North Korea fascinates me because it is the country where we have the least information.  It sounds so \\"1984\\"-esque, and yet after reading this book, I am convinced that the dictators are worse than Big Brother.  I liked that the author provided some history into how North Korea became the way it is - it is another causality of the Cold War.  (I also thought it was very interesting that some people went back to North Korea during that time because they thought it would be the \\"better\\" of the 2 Koreas!)  Since this book mainly is about the defectors and the current North Korea conditions, I will be venturing out and reading more on the history of Korea, pre-Cold War split.<br /><br />The six defector's stories along with the author's limited and monitored visits paint a grim picture of a desperate country.  The government goes to such extremes to keep ANY dissidents locked out.  A simple suspicion from the wrong person and your life is wiped away, and hopefully, just yours and not your family's as well.  The author's writing flows and each of the defector's stories read like a gripping novel that is hard to put down.<br /><br />I can only hope that Kim Jong-Un can take make a change for his people.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It is a enjoyable fun paced game that uses your mined,  and you can play with your kids or by yourself.

B001993Y2C|5.0|Great packaging, the edition is incredible and watching BSG in HD as I had never seen it is a pleasure!!!. It takes a few moments to know how to open the box but it's a fun puzzle. The only thing missing is a booklet that let you know what it's inside each disc.
1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is a book that gives psychological and spiritual hope for many who are fearful or curious about the after death experience.
0545265355|4.0|The quality of this set is very nice. The box is sturdy and the books are of equal quality. As far as the story goes for a trilogy: The first book was phenomenal. The second promising. And the third was terribly rushed. The last could easily have been twice as long. All around it's a great read for someone wanting a good fiction read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Best app ever.  makes time just fly by and so many games to unlock and choose from! I play it every day!

B002UJIY7A|4.0|You will get no plot spoilers here. Why should one own this movie? Beautiful scenery, good acting, humor, and some interesting (if not simple) plot threads that keeps one guessing up until the final two minutes of the film.<br /><br />The beauty of owning such a movie is that you will watch it over and over again and say: How did I miss that? Do yourself a favor and go and pick it up and prepare to be entertained.<br /><br />Make sure you watch the unrated/director's cut.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so freaking addicting I love playing it. I always say I'm only gonna play it for a few mins but I end up on it for hours. highly recommend this game.

B0079XPUOW|2.0|After such fine books as Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, this is a very disappointing effort from this author.
1594135851|5.0|This book is great, it is amazing. I love the writing, the creativity,the plot. I think it would be a good idea to ready food and drinks by the bed before diving into the book. The character development in Catching Fire is also gratifying.<br />I love it.
0984999302|5.0|This is an amazing book written by *the* authorities in the field. I have been around start-ups for many years, and I also have been involved in innovation in large technology companies. In this book, Blank and Dorf lay out the a recipe for how to build a billion dollar company. Whereas most start-ups focus on their technology and perhaps their products, this text teaches you how to build a business and how to make a product that your customers are willing to buy. The predecessor to this book, \\"four steps to the Epiphany\\", was already great, but had a few rough corners. This book is just great.<br /><br />If you are thinking of starting a company, of if you are at a small company, or if you want to innovate withint a larger company: Read this book. It will change your life.

B005LW5J9O|5.0|Stephen Greenblatt gives a wonderfully vivid account of the rediscovery of Lucretius by former apostolic secretary Poggio Bracciolini.  Greenblatt writes with as much passion about manuscripts and books, not to mention clerical debauchery and cynicism, as about ideas. I thoroughly enjoyed these digressions, which are indeed relevant, but the result was that he had rather less time to explore the actual meaning of [[ASIN:0140447962 The Nature of Things (Penguin Classics)]]and its impact on the modern world.  Not that he neglects these -- there are fascinating discussions of Sir Thomas Moore and of Montaigne, for example -- but he compresses and oversimplifies.<br /><br />Montaigne took from Lucretius atomism, Epicurean pleasure, and the value of uncertainty (open skepticism in the tradition of Sextus Empiricus, or, as he put it: What do I know?).  The embrace of uncertainty, in particular, did not survive in the dominant scientific world-view of the 17th Century. The Cartesian world was split between absolute doubt and absolute certainty, requiring rigorous mathematical proof.  Lucretius was a materialist, but he never suggested what so many now believe, that organisms are machines.  I recommend supplementing Greenblatt with [[ASIN:0226808386 Cosmopolis: The Hidden Agenda of Modernity]], a fascinating look at what Stephen Toulmin calls \\"The 17th Century Counter-Renaissance.\\"  Toulmin sees the assassination of Henri IV as the traumatic event that separated Montaigne and Descartes. Had Lucretius and Montaigne (whose essay \\"On Cannibals\\" shows more sympathy for indigenous peoples than did the conquerors) really prevailed in the West, modernity might have been more life-affirming and less tragic than it has turned out to be.

B005SFS4ZU|5.0|I can not remember a time when The Phantom of the Opera brought me to tears; this production, however, brought me to tears numerous times. ABSOLUTELY THE BEST performance I have ever witnesses. If you aren't sure you want to buy it, rent it at redbox, then you will go buy it.<br /><br />UNBELIEVABLY SPECTACULAR.
B003L77GG0|5.0|A perfect ending to a great show!! Even though the show was coming off a weak season 9, season 10 really stepped it up. The return of Jonathan Kent and the Luthors it really was a season true fans can appreciate!! The only bad thing was the company Amazon got the set from. Warehouse Detail buyers beware!! The case was broken and the box was actually cut on the back. The packaging was way to tight causing even more damage to the box. The dvd\\"s were fine, but if you want a perfect box set, make sure you buy from another sellar!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I just finished all three books, and I am sad to say this trilogy is a flop. I heard it was a 'must read' so I purchased immediately.<br /><br />The characters are unbelievable (like a good looking, 26 year old multimillionaire who meets an innocent college girl). The style of the book is very juvenile and repeats the words \\"Jeez\\" and \\"Double crap.\\" Really? And don't get me started on the number f-bombs in the books...I'm not a prude, but that word was just used way too much. The sex scenes really became a bore after a while and I found myself just skimming over them.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me interested in the book was wanting to know more about Christian's troubled past (that is why I'm giving the book two stars instead of only one). I was hoping the book would get better but when I got to the third one, I really couldn't wait for it to be over. Can't recommend this one!
0143119680|4.0|When historian Diana Bishop unassumingly calls a bewitched manuscript from the stacks of Oxford's Bodleian Library, she doesn't realize that the magic inside of her that she has considered unwelcome for so long is soon to cause problems for her and will open the floodgates to a world of magical creatures that she has tried to remain removed from her whole life.<br /><br />Suddenly vampires, witches and daemons are swarming the Bodleian, all with the desire to get their hands on this powerful alchemical manuscript, for they feel it can unlock the secrets about their future and their past.<br /><br />One such creature with an interest in the manuscript is Matthew Clairmont, a charming vampire who seduces Diana and becomes invested, not only in her research, but also in her personally. This quickly angers the supernatural world of creatures and Diana and Matthew must fight not only for the manuscript, but also for their love.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches was not a book I was expecting to like. I've never been a huge fan of the paranormal and this book is teeming with it. Despite the fact that the characters felt emotionally distant, I still really enjoyed spending time with them and found their plight fascinating. A good way to describe this book would be a much more grown up, erudite version of Twilight. So all the Twi-hards who are all grown up and need a new fix, Matthew Clairmont might be a good replacement for Edward Cullen.
0307951529|5.0|Clear and concise, this book laid out plainly how best to begin, maintain, and continually improve whatever idea you may have for a business. A highly recommended read.
B0087240Z4|5.0|Words cant describe how incredible this album is! Billy Corgan said in an interview that this album wouldn't have 1 or 2 good songs, that would likely be singles. He said that every song would be just as good as the others in its own way and man was he right! The album is completely unique. This is a must have for Pumpkins fans.<br /><br />Easily a 10/10<br /><br />Thank you SP!!!
0452273331|3.0|I read The Fountainhead years and years ago and, like most very young people, I loved it. I came across it recently while clearing out boxes of old books; now that I am older and (hopefully!) wiser, I wondered if the book would hold up for me, and I re-read it. I did still like the book, but certain things stood out for me that I don't believe registered with me originally, particularly Ayn Rand's innate elitism and her fascination with physical looks (particularly concerning women).<br /><br />When she depicted someone of admirable character she would so very often describe them as having a noble, aristocratic or patrician bearing. She was particularly fond of the word aristocratic to convey the idea of physical attractiveness. Also, she continually portrayed Dominique as fragile, delicate or insubstantial in appearance, qualities which I believe were meant to put the reader in mind of a frail but lovely princess (i.e., the opposite of a robust working-class type who would, presumably by definition, not be beautiful).<br /><br />On the other hand, Rand's short-hand for conveying a person or type of person's low character was to describe them as having as much intellectual depth as a chambermaid, or in one instance, as being about as refined as \\"a woman you might see riding the subway.\\" This last one amused me, since I have frequently ridden the subway. Another, rather horrifying means of conveying unattractiveness was to describe someone as being \\"greasy\\" or \\"thick\\" lipped.<br /><br />I think the most appalling instance of her reflexive distaste for the poor was when Howard Roark is pitching to a committee the idea of a summer resort aimed toward the needs of the middle class. He says that the very rich and the very poor do not have a dilemma as to how to enjoy their summers because (paraphrasing): \\"The rich can simply escape to their estates, and the poor don't mind the feel and smell of one another's bodies against one another in the summer.\\"<br /><br />Rand's stubborn determination to equate beauty with goodness and ugliness or poverty with evil I think connects to her own personal obsession with physical looks. Over the years I read that she was extremely preoccupied with other people's looks and would genuflect toward a person she found to be particularly attractive. She herself felt her only two good features were her eyes and her legs, and always took pains to show off those assets.<br /><br />I'm focusing on these two aspects of the novel (Rand's fixation on physical beauty as denoting goodness or integrity and her automatic loathing of poverty vs. her reverence for perceived aristocracy) because I've seen that her actual philosophies have been discussed thoroughly already by wiser Amazon readers than this one!
0375869026|5.0|Auggie Pullman knows he's different. He was born with a severe facial deformity and has spent his entire life dealing with people's reaction to his appearance. Due to the large number of surgeries and health issues he experienced as a young child, Auggie has always been homeschooled - until his parents decide that 5th grade would be the perfect year for him to go to a real school and interact with real kids.<br /><br />And that is where the main conflict of this story begins.<br /><br />What is so extraordinary about Wonder is that there are many different points of view to explore and discuss. Auggie is never explicitly bullied at school, but he experiences a great deal of unkind treatment from classmates. But there are also the behaviors of his classmates and family members that kids can discuss and empathize with. This is a novel that shows kids there are no simple answers in life.<br /><br />I'm sure this phrase has already become cliche even though the book has only been out for a few months now but Wonder is a wonder of a book. It's something you read that will stay with you for a long time. Auggie is one of the most lovable, empathetic characters I've ever encountered in my reading life. There's a scene in the book where Auggie's father hugs him and tells him how much he loves his face, and that very scene made me long to do the same thing for him. I loved Auggie in that moment in the same way his parents did.<br /><br />If I had one criticism of the book it's that the ending was a little too perfect for real life, but at the same time, it was absolutely necessary for readers to feel satisfied that karma finally showed some kindness to Auggie. You can't leave readers feeling like the hand Auggie had been dealt was still rearing its ugly head.

0547258305|4.0|Imagine you have a special talent and you are so good at it, that your ability of itself becomes magical.  Oh, and your eyes are two different colors.  That's what it means to be a Graceling... and the premise hooked me into reading the novel.  Katsa is graced with the ability for killing.  This book is how she uses it.<br /><br />Rarely I have read a heroine who is so outright battle-overpowered VS. every character in the book.  The only way for Katsa to 'lose' is for her to surrender or be convinced not to fight.  This might seem boring, but Katya's conflicts are emotional in nature, and the primary antagonist has an unblockable Grace of 'persuasion'.  So plenty of worthwhile conflict including mind-readers.<br /><br />Book wasn't perfect -- wanted more epic battles, and I believed 50-100 pages of travel/wilderness scenes could have been compressed into a few paragraphs of exposition.  Pacing would have improved, and story would have been tighter.<br /><br />That said, I did enjoy \\"Graceling\\" and will be checking out Cashore's other works.  Excellent, for a first novel.  Do be aware that it doesn't follow 'traditional' YA roles... Katya rejects both childbirth and marriage and does 'go all the way' in a non-graphic sense.  She is responsible about contraception.  For me, this was a plus.
B000BTJA5Q|1.0|After listening to this it just didn't feel right - it was not a celebration of Christmas and all that this holiday represents from either the secular or religious aspects, it seemed more about other things of winter, not at all the kind of uplifting celebration of Christmas that I want in my Christmas Holiday Music Collection - I wouldn't even give this away -it hit the TRASH!
B00846REIS|5.0|This book blew me away.  I loved it.  It's emotional, highly romantic, and incredibly swoon worthy.  It left me cheering wildly, sighing, and yes, even hugging my kindle at various moments.<br /><br />In Bared to You, Eva is a driven, strong business woman that's broken away from her wealthy family and is carving out her own place in the world.  She's chosen to start in at the bottom of a company, and work her way up the old fashion way.  To this end, she's secured a position for herself as an executive assistant at a marketing firm.  What she doesn't count on in her five year plan is meeting Gideon Cross, the company's incredibly sexy owner.  She stumbles into him (literally) several times, and they have an instant connection.  While their chemistry is undeniable, she is scared off by his approach, which is very high handed and aggressive.  He's a beautiful, wealthy man, and is a man used to getting what he wants with very little effort.  Eva isn't impressed by his wealth, and she quickly determines he's more trouble than he's worth.<br /><br />And so the hunt begins.  And it is enthralling.  One of the hottest things about this book is just how much Eva legitimately fights her attraction to Gideon, and how doggedly he pursues her.  I loved every second of his chase.<br /><br />Gideon Cross - what can I say about him?  He's incredibly sexy, 100% alpha, but able to see and appreciate the intrinsic worth in Eva, and express his love for her openly and beautifully.  Both he and Eva have tragic pasts that have given them ample reasons to close themselves off.  However with each other they are they are truly open - completed bared to one another.  The title of the book is apropos as there are definitely a lot of sexy times in the novel, but there is also a baring of souls that I found incredibly moving.  Both of them have to work through their past hurts to be good for one another.  It all felt very real, and vital and I cried on more than one occasion as they learned how to open up and love one another.<br /><br />Eva is amazing - she's strong, intelligent, and nurturing.  Her past has given her a wellspring of sympathy and care for others.  She looks after her friends, mothers them, and protects them.  For all her strengths, she is also very fragile in love. Her past has given her a fight of flight tendency.  She runs when she's hurt.  I really identified with her strengths and failings, and found her to be an incredibly realistic and likeable character.<br /><br />The romantic path this novel takes is not a straight line.  The trauma from both character's pasts ensures they take two steps back for every one they take forward.  This creates a delicious amount of romantic tension and suspense.  I was never quite sure Gideon and Eva were going to make it, and that doubt kept me on the edge of my seat.  I hate when romance novels throw us easy love stories.  Two destined soul mates that instantly fall in love, and know they'll never be apart.  The ease of the love stories cheapens them in my estimation.  Eva and Gideon have an uphill fight every step of the way with their love, but that pulled me into their story.  It made me care.  And it made every victory they experienced as a couple that much more cathartic for me.<br /><br />The author has a way with words.  Her prose is poetic and moving.  I had a hard time picking what quotes to put in this review, because there are just so many good ones.<br /><br />Bared to You has been criticized for being Fifty Shades of Grey 2.0, and, as much as I hate to say it, I think it kind of deserves that censure.  This is the only negative thing I can say about the book. It's SUCH a similar story, but it's better written, with stronger, more likeable characters, and more realistic phycology.  It also has less S&M elements.  I wish I'd read it first, so I could have spared myself the inevitable comparisons to Fifty Shades because it's five times the book.<br /><br />This story had me laughing, crying, and swooning in a major way.  It's everything I look for in a romance story.  Great characters, and a romance that keeps you captivated, in suspense, turning the pages, just waiting to see if everything turns out well in the end. Recommended for fans of Fifty Shades, Beautiful Disaster, and Easy.ying, and swooning in a major way.  It's everything I look for in a romance story.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased both my sets of MDR-7506 headphones in 1999, after using them in various studios for years.  I take care of my gear and these are sturdy and are still in like new condition after many studio recordings and on location audio and video shoots.  I have listened here and there to other headphones of varying price. Sennheiser has some great headphones.  Skull Candy (my son has) makes some good compact ones for ipod and mp3 player use.  But for pro audio and video I stick with these Sony's.  Just like Sure's SM-58 mic these will not be obsolete anytime soon.  I have created many believers (and probably customers) when people ask can they hear the mix or the sound and say \\"wow these sound really good and feel nice.\\"  The newer version of these phones have the updated design for the ear pads and I am sure will last much longer before needing to be replaced.  It is easy and inexpensive to replace the worn out old style ear pads.  The replacements are available here on amazon or on ebay.  Thank You Sony for this great sounding set of studio monitors/headphones!
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I have read a good deal of Robert E. Howard and have to say it is nice to see something much closer to his actual work.  The old Arnold version was okay, but things like \\"the riddle of steel\\" was never in the Conan stories.  And Crom was not a Norse god, and Valhalla wasn't part of Conan's people's mythology.  Crom was a dark deity, and one best avoided, and his name generally used as a curse...  very appropriately used in this movie as a swear.<br /><br />There are a couple cheesy Hollywood moments, most notable the flipping carriage in slow-motion.  That I could have done without.  But otherwise I was quite happy with this version.  Conan looked more like a warrior than a body-builder (two very different body types, as anyone who knows much on the subject can tell you) and his overall attitude was very fitting.  The magical evil the villain harnesses is even a little tentacle-y, which given Howard's long distance friendship with HP Lovecraft is where that influence came from in his stories; Howard's 'gods' tended to be a bit on the cthonic side.  A nice little bit put in there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not into these kind of books. However, after all the raves and reviews of this book, I purchased it on my kindle. Only thing I have to say, \\"Please don't make this into a movie!!!!!\\" I already have my visual of Mr. Gray and please don't mess it up!!! This book is really an swesome read! The characters are well thought out. Please don't make a movie, I don't think an actor today can capture this man's aura!!! Seriously!!!!

B007C4ZJ0S|5.0|I'm pretty shocked at the mixed response this movie has gotten. I just watched it and was wowed, but looks like it's not everyone's cup of tea, at least here on Amazon. All I can say is that, in addition to the raw, kickass fight scenes, the characters are quite deep and compelling, especially given how little time is permitted to sketch some of them within the confines of a fast-moving spy flick.<br /><br />Soderbergh is definitely a hit-or-miss director, and this one definitely has some of the usual trappings of his other movies. But to me, Haywire is a dead-on hit, and the Soderbergh cliches that are present (music by the always-funky David Holmes, quick, jargon-heavy, almost-noir dialogue by uber-attractive leads, a sense of seriousness that flirts with self-parody) are quite welcome b/c they're handled so well. To me, Haywire came across like a return to his roots, much more similar to the tightly-tuned and quietly powerful \\"Out of Sight\\" than to some of his later, more far/over-reaching efforts.<br /><br />Perhaps most surprising, I thought athlete Gina Carano was terrific as an actress -- imposing but still vulnerable, witty, and just very real (and smokin' hot, of course). And between this and 21 Jump Street, Channing Tatum is turning into quite a promising star. And all the other amazing, established A-list actors are as consistently great as always without overwhelming the movie with star power; what a cast!<br /><br />So definitely give this one a try if you like smart, raw action flix, you won't regret it. And yes, the plot and dialogue are twisty, but to me that just makes them more authentic-sounding, even if I had to rewatch the movie to catch all the nuances.
0345803493|5.0|I once again enjoyed the love story about a relationship between a damaged young man who truly wants to be loved and an innocent young woman who is discovering the power of love. This book has more emotion and more drama with more characters involved. Mrs. Robinson has a huge part, as well as, Christian's family and doctor. The eroticism is kicked up a few notches. Once again, the story is way too long and the editing is horrible. (\\"Oh my\\" is not uttered as much.) I can look beyond these two flaws and see the overall beauty of their story.

0307887448|5.0|I decided to write a review for this book because as a child of the 1980s and a GenX geek I feel like I am it's target audience. I have to give it my highest recommendation. This was exactly the book I was waiting for, but just didn't know it. I can understand if some people might not understand every geek reference in the book, but Cline does a great job filling you in and keeping you in the inner circle. There's a great adventure waiting for those whoe've yet to read this one, I just wish there were more stories in this universe already written so I could dive into the next installment.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This is a great book! In typical Stephen King fashion, he paints a marvelous word portrait of the characters and keeps you in suspense as to what will happen to them! This book is much less graphic then some Stephen King books. Instead of the typical horror it is built on suspense. I am about halfway finished reading the book on my Kindle and hope to finish it on my upcoming trip to Dallas!  My trip is a  perfect complement to the story!
B004LROUW2|2.0|This is my first time reading a Murakami novel. I was very excited about reading this book in the beginning. It had a way of captivating the reader's interest and maintaining it for a while. I was hoping for a better explanation of everything in the book but the author failed to explain and left a lot of things to the reader's imagination. After finishing half the book, I couldn't wait to get to the end. You wouldn't miss much if you skipped pages ahead. By the end I couldn't take it anymore.

Thank you Game of Thrones for hours of entertainment.<br /><br />If you like the show, and how it is filmed, you will like to read these books.

Where would I be without an iPhone? Probably waiting until next April to find out what happens with the story.
B000X1Z0BU|1.0|I heard a song from this play on the Tony awards on TV recently. I noticed that this play received 5 Tony awards, and I enjoyed the song, so I ordered the dvd. I was utterly disappointed with this production. Every other word spoken in several scenes is f_ _ _ (rhymes with duck). I found this to be so offensive that it totally negated any positive effects of the music. As for the music, several of the songs are more shouted than sung, and the music is dissonant and harsh rather than melodic, sweet and lyrical. I read the reviews for this play before ordering it, and no one even mentioned the offensive language! I would like to send this back to Amazon for a full refund. I wish that Amazon had a better method for completing reviews. If you had a specific question about the presence of obscenities, perhaps a kind soul would indicate this and save others the pain of purchasing a dvd that is offensive. I did not give this dvd any stars, since I believe it did not deserve any, but I was asked to rate it, and I did not know how to give it less than one star. Sincerely, Paula from Stony Point, NC
B004LUHQ1G|2.0|Listen, I was super pumped for this album to come out... I heard Rope and White Limo before the record came out and listened to them over and over. I watched the little documentary on the \\"making of\\" this record on Palladia. When I found out my homeboy Butch Vig had a hand in this, it just fueled my excitement. So during the Palladia special, they made this huge deal about how the record was going to be recorded on tape. I'm sorry, but I'm not a mindless fanboy and I think that going backwards in technology is inferior. I felt like this was a gimmick to spread some kind of hype about the album. They also made a huge fuss about Bob Mould being featured on Dear Rosemary, a song that just doesn't sound good at all. Anyway, so I run out on my lunch break on release day and bought this CD and was quickly disappointed. The only 2 songs I liked were Rope and White Limo. Go figure. It has been over a year now and when I see all these 4 and 5 star ratings, I just have to wonder. Why.<br /><br />I think that 2 stars is an accurate rating for this CD. Songs like Dear Rosemary, Arlandria, and I Should Have Known just sound horrible and are not memorable. This is by no means one of FF's best. I recommend downloading Rope and White Limo for $2 on Amazon mp3 instead of spending your hard earned dollar on the whole thing.
B0077SGMXM|4.0|this is a pretty fun game with tons of courses. I think it will be fun to play and play again. nooches.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|The first three tracks are great, the suite at the end is good also. it is still growing on me. so far my favorite track is 'Isn't It Time' with lead vocals shared by Brian and Al(made me realise how much I missed Al's vocals in the vocal blend as he has maintained a much lower profile than his bandmates have in the years leading up to the reunion). another highlight for me is 'The Private Life Of Bill& Sue',with it's catchy ABBA-esque chorus and an intro slightly reminiscent of the classic 60's BenE King/Phil Spector collaboration, Spanish Harlem. 'Shelter' has an intro not too dissimilar to Sunday Kind Of Love off of their 1978 long-player called M.I.U. Also some have classified \\"Daybreak\\" as just another neo-Kokomo moment for Michael Edward Love. As for me, I give Mike kudos as i do believe Daybreak to be one of the albums highlights and one of the best Love-penned tunes since 1976's Everyones In Love With You. The last three songs, a suite consisting of \\"From There to Back Again, \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\"is really good and a real treat for us Today and Pet Sounds era Beach Boys fans.Of those three last tracks, my favorite, \\"From There to Back Again\\" has an awesome lead vocal by Al Jardine, who is sometimes criminally under-used as a lead vocalist. His best since his lead on the live version of You Still Believe In Me from 1973's In Concert album.\\"Strange World\\" is another one that's a \\"grower\\", so it's still growing on me.  I have to say this new album has confounded my expectations already with just a few listens. It's infectious as Beach Boys music should be.
0374203032|5.0|I checked this book out of the library. I appreciated it so much that I'm buying a copy so I can read it again, underline and write notes all over it. It contains a wealth of fascinating facts and insights about them. It is also wonderfully readable. I disagree with some commenters who think it is too limited in scope. It focuses on a very specific topic and is quite thorough in exploring it.
B00354YA2M|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book because as an Australian I was interested in seeing how a person from another culture viewed my country Bill Bryson was easy to read and treated it with a sense of humour which made it an enjoyable experience
B006YDG0KG|5.0|I've heard many people referring to this book as \\"life changing\\" but I have to disagree. I loved the book and it was such a useful way to remind yourself to be grateful for absolutely everything that you have in your life because it could all be taken away in a second.<br /><br />The exercises do require some work but its all do-able. It's hard at first but it then becomes habit to set some time aside to complete the exercises.<br /><br />We all get way to caught up in ourselves and our lives and the hum-drum of daily life and that means we forget to be grateful. This book is a definite must for every bookshelf!
B007LNJ3YS|5.0|Perfect album I bought the record and it's been on the player since.  It's ear candy with vitamins for your thoughts.
B0059XTV4Y|2.0|I was looking forward to W.E. thinking it was a historical drama based on the love story of the 20th Century. The King of England renounced his throne to be with the woman he loved. What could make a better story?<br />Unfortunately, Madonna's version is scrambled between fact, fiction and fantasy. The first minutes were confusing as two parallel stories are running. It is the story of Wallis and Edward but it is also the story of Wally, a woman trapped in a loveless marriage in the late 90's dreaming of the romance her namesake enjoyed.<br /><br />So much potential is missed in this story and often fascinating aspects of the royal love affair are glazed over. We are taken back and forth between stories as Wally connects items at the Duke and Duchess auction at Sotheby's. Wally looks at a tablecloth and that is the transition to the past as that tablecloth is being laid for a dinner party held by the Duke and Duchess.<br /><br />Kudos should be given to the costume designer and art director of this film. They do take us back to an authentic feeling 1930's England. The detail is remarkable so it is disappointing that this film needs to tell two parallel stories without concentrating on one story. It would be beyond fascinating to be taken deeper into the mind of Wallis Simpson. Just as her king gave up his throne, she gave up all semblances of the life she knew to live a semi-nomadic life as an outcast. David, as he was lovingly known by his family, could not return to England and was all but banished by his family. It would have been intriguing to further explore his relationship with his German-born mother Queen Mary and his relationship with his brother and sister-in-law who ascended the thrown after his abdication. George VI, the current Queen of England's father, is portrayed as a weak and ineffectual man prone to stuttering while his wife, Queen Elizabeth (later to be known as the Queen Mother) is potrayed as rather vile, domineering and heartless. What was thereal story?<br /><br />The idea that once Edward (aka David) abdicated there was no turning back for Wallis Simpson. She was now forever tied to the ex-king. Nothing could be changed and she was destined to be his wife. How happy was the marriage? Was she manipulated by a needy husband who had literally given up the world for her?<br /><br />Our modern Wally begins to unravel the truth in this not so fairy tale romance. She \\"interacts\\" with Wallis as if the two are one and she begins to understand Wallis in a symptathetic way that has never been seen before. Wallis is no longer the evil twice-divorced dragon who almost tore an empire apart. She did not want Edward to abdicate, yet he did and the rest was hisory.<br /><br />Obviously, this film is visually stunning in its scenes from the 1930's. The elegate jewelry and clothing of the Duchess show that an ordinary looking woman can become an object of stunning beauty and inspiration. The film is just lost in its need to run a parallel story set in modern times. A potentially beautiful film is lost in a bad script.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I like this book. If you are a fan of Star Trek The Original Series, you can fully understand this book. It is a good book but be warned that it useses a exessive amount of voulgar slang.
B007L96SI6|3.0|Music is a personal choice.  This just wasn't what I expected.  I still play it once in awhile to see if I get used to it,  so far not good for me.  I was looking for that powerful raspy voice I thought I heard on American Idol.  The seller, shipping, price was all good in this transaction.
B006RUJST6|5.0|One of the best and most memorable books I have read in a very long time.<br /><br />I don't know how to review this book without gushing about it or using an unreasonable amount of superlatives. This book and its sequel [[ASIN:1470124327 Point of Retreat (Volume 2)]] are just... WOW. A solid story line that is beautifully written, with simple descriptions and dialogues, but so emotionally charged that half of the time I didn't know whether I wanted to cry or laugh. My poor heart was in knots so many times.<br /><br />If I have to choose one thing that I loved the most about these books it would be the dialogues, especially some of the stuff the younger characters were saying (I want Kiersten to be my best friend too!). I loved how the characters interacted with each other, how open everyone was and how much they all loved each other. ... OK, I can't just pick one thing!! I loved the love story between Will and Lake, I loved the way Will loved his brother Caulder and the way Lake loved her brother Kel, I loved Julia, I loved Eddie, I loved the slams, I loved suck and sweet time, I love the vase of stars, I loved Kiersten, ... I even loved the Chuck Norris jokes!<br /><br />This is such a serious book, though. The issues of loss, grief and survival are all tackled so beautifully, using humour to lighten things up. You feel so serenely happy after you finish reading it but you are also aware that you've just been through an emotional roller-coaster.<br /><br />I loved loved loved these books!! This is simply one of those times when 5 stars is just not enough.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun i can run from monkeys  everyday i come home snd play temple run on the kindlefire
0061692042|3.0|What an odd read!!!<br /><br />There are no surprises in this. You know from the opening sentence that is parents are going to rob a bank.  As you read on you find out all before it happens. You know that his mother is going to commit suicide in jail. You know that there are going to be murders.  You know in advance that his sister is going to run away.  You know that he is going to Canada.<br /><br />Maybe some books are like a river tumbling down from the mountains - face paced, gathering speed, sweeping all along on its rush to the sea.  But this is a book like a lazy stretch of water on the coastal plain - meandering, backtracking, some parts stagnant, some parts eddying around obstacles, languid.  I can't even say this narrative is a \\"slow reveal\\" because it is all there, teasing the reader to dip their toes in the water to find the depths of the narrative.<br /><br />There were many times when I wanted to shake Dell and have him take a more active role in his own life.  To me it wasn't a coming-of-age story because Dell never took this responsibility.  It had a stronger flavour of we-are-who-we-are and the impact of parenting.  Dell seemed to be just an observer ... too remote from his feelings to even be described as melancholy ... maybe pathologically innocent would be the closest.<br /><br />It is calm, detailed, teasingly repetitive, bleak, engrossing and annoying!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am dumbfounded by the popularity of this book.  I have never read a more boring, trite, cliche, lame story in my life. The idiotic rumblings of the main character make me want to shoot myself. If I have to read the phrases \\"oh my\\" or \\"my inner goddess\\" one more time...  And I keep hearing people say how shocking it is...but, frankly, the sex scenes are more like dime store romance novels or teenage fantasy.  There's absolutely nothing redeeming about this sad, depressing book.
B0057ZEMF2|4.0|After hearing an NPR discussion of this CD, I was interested. As someone who has a number of flamenco recordings and who has recently rediscovered Indian sitar music, I thought that this attempt to blend or interface these two could be a rich one - and, for the most part, it is. As I heard in the NPR report - and would agree - some of the cuts do better at integrating the traditions in a direct and creative way. Other cuts seem to alternate between one tradition and another, but don't succeed in really \\"weaving\\" them together. Still, there is no bad song on the CD - though I enjoy some cuts more than others. Certainly the musicians and vocalists are topnotch. And, some of the shrillness (to my ear) of some Indian singing and some of the harshness of some flamenco voices, is in this CD avoided. The voices are rich and passionate, yet remain pleasingly restrained. This is a good effort in global music.
0307592731|5.0|From the beginning of Wild, it's clear that Cheryl Strayed was at a turning point in her life when she decided to embark on her PCT hike. She was floundering, unable to get a grasp on anything, and she needed to throw herself into something wholeheartedly. Being at the mercy of nature, rather than the casual cruelty of life, was something that Cheryl craved. In her solitude, she could ponder her life and grieve the death of both her mother and her marriage, and perhaps gain some closure. It's a beautifully written and contemplative memoir, about the highs and lows of life and our relationships with one another.<br /><br />But at the same time, Wild is so much more than a memoir about loss and grief. It's primal, about Cheryl's fight with the world around her. It's about lifting her monstrously heavy backpack for the first time (aptly nicknamed Monster) and losing her boots on the trail. It's about realizing how horribly unprepared she is, especially with her inexperience at hiking. It's about worrying whether she'll have enough food and water, and not being sure if she has the energy to take another step. Just as much as it's about a hike and about grief, this is a memoir of survival.<br /><br />Cheryl's frankness with the reader in Wild is incredibly refreshing. Her emotions are raw, her grief bubbling towards the surface. She doesn't mince words or try to make herself appear in the best light possible. She tells the reader the pure, unadulterated truth and leaves it for them to decide and judge. Strayed tells some difficult, heartbreaking stories, and she makes no secret of the fact that the breakup of her marriage was in no small part due to her own infidelity. But instead of judging Cheryl, the reader is inclined to sympathize with her. Yes, she made some bad decisions, but in the end, no one is perfect. Had she tried to skirt around these issues, it may have been easy to pronounce judgment on her, but her refreshing honesty makes her very appealing.

B007VT6QSI|5.0|Well #Beliebers , the wait is over! The long-awaited studio album does not fail to deliver. This is meant to be the album to convert the haters and Justin certainly goes all-out to demonstrate how he and his music have matured. There is a good mix of styles with collaborations with older, established artists to add credibility to his move into a broader target audience. There are certainly nods to artists that have influenced him (with some MJ sampling and a modern-day \\"Billie-Jean\\" in \\"Maria\\" reflecting on his own much-publicized brush with paternity allegations) but this is no copy-cat album. Bieber has co-written all the tracks and showcases his post-puberty voice with skill; retaining a pure falsetto along with the deeper tones that I'm sure will continue to set many a teen's heart a-flutter. There is no doubt that those already infected by Bieber Fever will not be disappointed but this album deserves a wider audience than the already converted. Could this be the record that makes owning a Justin Bieber record merely a pleasure rather than a guilty one? You'd better #Believe it!
145210655X|4.0|My wife (and 4 year old son) got this for me for father's day.  I had heard it on NPR and was going to buy it for myself so this was a very nice surprise.  This is a very entertaining little book.  There are a few direct quotes from the movies that Vader had originally said in a menacing way which have been repurposed for a humorous bent as well as a few absurd situations that every dad can relate to.<br /><br />This is not necessarily the type of book that you will re-read, but it was fun to read it with my son.
B005EXA8XC|4.0|I received the blu-ray of this for fathers day, even though I asked for the DVD specifically because of all of the sync issues outlined by other reviewers. Not sure if I just got lucky, or if there's been a different production run of the disks, but I don't see any sync issues on my Panasonic home theater system.<br /><br />I've been watching pretty close, and have seen *maybe* a couple places where the symbol crashes don't match up, but even then it's close. Could just be my eyes playing tricks on me. It's certainly not the nightmare that others have described. YMMV.<br /><br />My only knock is that it's just the concert, no extras at all. A couple bonus features would have been nice.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like all the challenges &amp; all the variety. I just wish it was easier to get more points. its a very good game overall.
0307951529|5.0|I am one of those individuals that are described in this book. It seems I followed all of the \\"non rules\\" that they suggest. After being out of work for an extended period, I found myself in a sad predicament. And...even though I look much younger than my actual age, I faced age discrimination, some of which was blatant. What to do?<br />I did exactly what this book recommends. I really didn't have a choice! So I took an idea that I had since 2006 and made it work without any loans or grants.<br /><br />What Gretchen & Chris suggest is to use your PASSION first & foremost. This seems pretty self explanatory, yet many people simply focus on making money as the #1 priority in starting a business. While that subject IS of prime importance, it won't get you thought the tough times...PRIOR TO making money, since every business goes through a start up phase, especially if you're doing it on a shoestring budget. Whatever you don't spend in money, you will make up for in time, toil, and most of all creativity.<br /><br />If you're looking for a book that gives you a \\"how-to\\", in other words....what KIND of business to get into & how...this book isn't for you. You would be better served by considering a franchise operation that does just that. The $100 Startup is entirely different, and is intended to motivate you to take the next steps on your own, which is only practical since every business will have a different set of rules. The point behind this book is to exploit your chosen passion (niche) in a way that can serve others & create a new demand.<br /><br />This idea has nothing to do with competing with other well established businesses. For me, the best business plan was to simply get started & go as far as I could. At this point I qualify for micro-financing for small business since one of the requirements is that you have made strides in starting up...rather than waiting for a loan. I have actually started ANOTHER business locally, which has taken off...and again, I did it with very little cash. My motive was to move beyond simply surviving and to be able to take my first business to the next level with advertising, etc. This business is also a passion (hobby) of mine, and I could see a need in sharing my information to help people save money. I have also started writing a book on this topic (via Createspace) and this is an idea that ANYONE can do to earn some extra money while polishing your image as an expert in your field.<br /><br />The $100 Startup is very entertaining to read...and tells the truth to anyone who can have the courage to face what starting up your own business will REALLY be like...vs. \\"magical thinking\\" (or fantasy). If you cannot dedicate yourself full-time to your dream business, the info can still be beneficial to use in your free time, or on a part-time basis. If you have time to watch TV, or get lost online (at sites like Facebook) you have time to create your own business! Get started!<br /><br />Highly recommended! I also recommend \\"Quit Your Job And Never Go Back\\" by David Hooper (this is a workbook that will keep your progress & goals on track with measurable results) & \\"Poke The Box\\" by Seth Godin for some creative (albeit somewhat unorthodox)advice on motivation and coming up with fresh, inspired ideas. Watch TED.com to see how people have used these ideas to solve problems, and design innovative solutions. In other words...take this SERIOUSLY and you will succeed. This is NOT a \\"get rich quick\\" scheme, which seldom, if ever work. Instead, proceed with whatever your passion is, add some discipline in getting it started and assign some time daily to keep it going and let Nature take it's course. Do this much & you will succeed!id it with very little cash.

B007SGM084|1.0|I purchased these books after someone referred them.  I wish they had told me more about the books.  these books are not worth the money.  They are so filthy.  I couldn't read it.  I guess if you like sex on every page and get in to S&M....  these are for you.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have been wanting to purchase this book for a month or so. I've heard everyone talk about it and say how good it is. I saw it on Dr. Oz and everyone on there was just raving how much their sex life has improved after reading it. REALLY??? After reading it I am saddened that a good portion of the population apparently leads a very \\"vanilla\\" sex life. If you think this is porn then you have never read it, nor watched it. I've read hotter sex in a Harlequin novel and as far as the bondage etc. goes....ehhhh, it's on the very edge of it.<br /><br />In reading some of the review I totally have to agree with the over use of phrases. I got so tired of her biting her lip and him saying \\"you know what that does to me\\". Yeah, it's boring. That's something a teenager would get so turned on with. Am I the only one that hated all those emails? I did find them kind of amusing but come on, there was only 372 pages to this book and I bet 30 of those pages were short little emails. That got old fast.<br /><br />I didn't hate the book but I was really disappointed in it to say the least. I read it in 6 hours and part of that time I was cleaning my house. It's a really quick read. I'm just sorry I paid $9.99 for it! I should have just put my name on the waiting list at the library. I'm not sure I will read book 2 and 3, I might just have my friends that read it fill me in on the rest.<br /><br />I did think she did a good enough job getting the reader to see under Christian's surface and see some of the good in him as well as seeing that Ana wasn't going to just go willingly with whatever he wanted. So that part was a positive. However if you are thinking this is going to change your love life, then I hope you are mistaken and if not, then I'm happy that this is all it took because you need a little imagination in the bedroom :)

B007P6VLRS|4.0|This is a Solid album from the SP and the best imo since Adore. Although the lineup has changed, this one holds up to all their albums released prior to Zeitgeist. Nicole is imo the best bassist they've ever had and it really shows on this album. Jeff brings a lot of new to the table and I have no problems with Mikey on drums. He's no Jimmy but to be so young I'm pretty impressed. He'll only get better working with Corgan and I believe him and the other new members are what kinda made this album special. I really enjoy the tracks Quasar, Violet Rays, Oceania, Pale Horse, Glissandra, and Inkless. The only real track that doesn't do much for me is My love is winter and even then I don't find it to be terrible so maybe it'll grow on me. The only real disappointment for me was the artwork. Usually the pumpkins have some interesting artwork but not so much this time but oh well the music is good. This one has some of the better guitar work he's done in awhile and the lyrics are pretty solid as well. I'm looking forward to the future and ready for the tour! Buy a copy put on some headphones and enjoy!

Perhaps to the \\"vanilla\\" reader, it might be packed full, but in reality, it really has very little in it.<br /><br />The story line is excellent.  I love the author, she makes you feel everything that you are reading.  I only wish there were more books in this series.  Through the trilogy, I have laughed, cried, and have even been stunned at times.  I edit stories, and have found nothing whatsoever to complain about.  The spelling is good, punctuation is great, and I love how the author brings in larger vocabulary all the way throughout.<br /><br />I am a very picky reader, and have not been able to put these books down.  I do hope Ms. James writes more in the near future!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This collection of books/novellas was surprising.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I'm glad I took the chance and read them.  The first novella leaves you hanging and not quite sure what is going on.  Then as you read more and more, you start to realize the inner workings of the landscape and characters.  The characters are great and the author does an excellent job of developing them.  I became attached to them and wanted to see them succeed!  This book is fast paced and easy to jump right into.  Very well written!  It is a nice change after all the predictable apocalyptic stories out there!

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I hesitated to buy this book but I am glad I did. I now know for sure that there are people who go through incredibly difficult situations and are given the grace to survive hardship. If an 11 year old girl can grow up in a tent in a backyard with the worst of humanity keeping her captive, what am I complaining about? I know she could not have possibly related it all to us, there are no words. I am just glad she did write the book so the rest of us can see what true courage looks like. I will be praying for Jaycee and her daughters each day, and giving thanks for the hope of survival for all missing children.
B00785P2QC|4.0|starts out slow. bit complicated at first. but overall a good game to play when you have some free time. plus its a free game unless you buy points.
B001PP9ALY|5.0|If you're looking for a film filled with lots of over the top action to keep you entertained, this is it.  I love this film... It's a funny, faced paced adrenaline rush.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of my favorite parts of this book series is the that it is slightly ridiculous. But that's why it's fiction. Is Ana sometimes a little too meek for my taste? Sure. Does Christian need to be smaked down every once in a while? Yeah. But at the end of the day this is a fun and easy read. It isn't meant to be social commentary or change the world, so if you're looking for a philiospical read skip this. If you are looking for something a little less serious this is a good way to spend your weekend.
B007PS0X0W|3.0|This is a non-stop action addition to the Underworld series, but it's a little short.  I enjoyed the film, but am glad I decided to stream it rather than see it in the theater.  It's too short and barely advances the storyline.  I would have like to have seen a longer film that wasn't so thin on plot.  Good, but could have been better.

B00005AREQ|5.0|Jeff Beck reinvents himself on this masterful piece of musician artistry. With production help from George Martin, along with the triad of Max Middleton on keys(previously from the 2nd Beck Group incarnation), Phil Chen on Bass and Richard Bailey on Drums, Blow by Blow is realized and recognized as one of the most popular and accessable guitar instrumental releases of its time. The record begins with You Know what I Mean, penned by Beck and Middleton, and is a funky groove complimented by Middleton's various keyboard arrangements on Fender Rhodes, Clavinet and electric piano, driven of course by Beck's multi-layered guitars and the tone that he achieves on his lead lines are deliciously strong, succinct and unprecedented. The rhythm section of Chen and Bailey shows off impeccable chops and structured improvisational qualities of a most high order. The cover of the Beatles' She's a Woman follows in and the arrangement given has a flavor of reggae/funk and Beck also uses the infamous \\"talk-box\\" contraption(something Peter Frampton would utilize to great success with a year later on his Frampton Comes Alive set), which further adds texture and a little bit of charm to this well arranged and tasteful cover.<br /><br />Further highlights on Blow By Blow is the cover of Stevie Wonder's Cause We've Ended as Lovers, which features one of Jeff's most prolific and endearing performances on this moody and organic number. His tone is absolutely on point with this track and the trend of \\"less is more\\" is used to a most great advantage here. Stevie himself guests on clavinet on the following track Thelonius, which is a tribute to the jazz icon Thelonius Monk and Beck once again uses the talk box in conjunction with the rave up fusion quality this track emanates. Middleton's Freeway Jam would also be another track of considerable legendary status as to the validity of Beck's guitar prowess and would be a featured number in most of Beck's live performances over the years. Blow by Blow re-establishes Jeff Beck as one of the more important British guitarists' of his generation, born out of the legendary Yardbirds foundation(including fellow peers Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page), and also the early years of his own solo career, culminating in a fresh and musically beneficial route for the guitarist to build his career upon. I've always admired Beck for his musicianship qualities and he is a favorite of mine as a result of his seemingly lack of commercial accessability sacrificed for the sake of his intimitable talents on the fretboard. Its musician's music, for the most part, but Blow is one of those rare instances that provides a broader spectrum for musicians and music fans alike. Therein lies Blow by Blow's great appeal. 5 Legendary Stars

B007EW9ISM|5.0|This stylus was rated very high in some comparisons i read.  I got this as a gift for my partner (and for me.  hehe!)  The understated styling is great.  Its like an object from a cartoon.  The size is perfect and works very well.  The rubber that covers the stylus does cling to dust and debris a bit though.  Silicone is great and horrible from this reason.<br /><br />Anyway.  I would say this would work well for kids using a tablet too.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book was so bad! Really terribly written. Not even a good smut book! At first I thought a man must have written it, because the sex scenes were described so badly and uncharacteristcally by the female, but No! A WOMAN wrote it!  What a waste of 10 bucks and 2 hours of my life!!!

B0082209XQ|2.0|Robert Pattinson escapes his vampire character into the primary lead in this 1890 Parisian costume drama.  Pattinson looks the part as an impoverished son of a farmer who elevates his social status by seducing powerful women or wives of powerful men.  Unfortunately he doesn't have the acting chops to pull off such a centrist role.  Directors Decian Donnellan and Nick Ormerod don't help as seemingly half the movie focuses on Pattinson various facial expressions.  Most of the time it is that blank look he perfected in the \\"Twilight\\" movies but without the glitter.<br /><br />The supporting cast is first rate.  Christini Ricci is the young wife of a powerful businessman who is rarely at home.  She falls for Georges (Pattinson) but her marriage precludes much beyond regular dalliances she arranges in a rented apartment.  Her young daughter, upon meeting Georges, calls him bel ami (beautiful friend).  Kristin Scott Thomas is the wife of a political leader and newspaper publisher (Colm Meaney).  She eventually succumbs to Georges.  Uma Thurman is Madeleine a behind-the-scenes political writer for her husband, and Georges boss, at the newspaper.  Yep, eventually he even marries her.<br /><br />We see all of this coming of course, along with the responses from the various ladies in Georges' life.  Outside a little skin from Ms. Ricci and Pattinson, there's little romance or titillation which would seem to be the point.  Ultimately, in spite of some interesting secondary characters, the film is a bore.

I can't wait to see what's in store for his next CD ! JD, Jimmy, Alex, and the rest of the band: \\"KEEP THE MUSIC SWINGIN\\" !!!!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|The Blu Ray will look amazing. But here's the scoop on the actual film: It's amazing.<br /><br />Is it what I expected? Not exactly. But the great thing about a legend like Ridley Scott, and Sci Fi in general, is that it can take you somewhere<br />you DIDN'T expect. If this was predictable, then people would complain about that. Get real people. Trust Mr. Scott, and enjoy the ride!<br /><br />I found myself wanting to go back and see Prometheus in the theater time and time again. It was just as good, even better, with every viewing.<br /><br />Buying the movie when it comes out was just a no brainer. I love the film, and hope for a sequel, and even more entries in the Alien/Predator universe.<br /><br />5 stars, amazing film.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|Heard much about this flick, but just want to know if the PIP issue is fixed for the BD version of this movie?
B0055PGUYU|5.0|At the end of the book the author mentions that many people that read this type of book are looking for concise answer to the question, How do I change a habit. The author gives us the framework of habits and then some good ways to identify and modify them. This book I think is better than most because it sets realistic expectations that habit change is going to take work. It also gives us tools to identify what a habit looks like and where exactly to apply the efforts to make the change.
1607053888|4.0|This is a great book with lots of variety in bags to make!  I love sewing bags and appreciate the varied designs provided in the book.  Its a great read with lots of pictures.  However, I prefer sewing without patterns.  I would rather have a size to cut out than a pattern to print out and make.  I did feel that many of the bags were for beginners up to intermediate so for more advanced sewers, maybe another book would be a better choice. If you love to sew bags, there is a bag in this book for everyone!
B008469DGY|4.0|A challenging game that is easy to use and is great for filling in ten minutes or more of down time. Good graphics and game play. Spend a buck, I feel I got my moneys worth in 1st week.
B000OLV97I|1.0|The makers of this movie butchered the story. This had the potential to be a masterpiece that rivaled lord of the rings. None of the races are depicted correctly, the Elves, Dwarves, Urgals, even the Ra'zac are nothing like in the books. the only exception may be the shade durza. Probably the one character they could have gotten away with massive reduction in appearance, as it's pretty much an overpowering psychopath. (If you read the books then you will understand more about this character why I say it could have done with a reduction in graphics, and why killing it gains Eragon the title shadeslayer)<br /><br />I can forgive appearances, and some omissions, and even a few changes to make the movie transition easier. However, outright changes in characters that break the overall story line, I hate with a passion. If they ever make a second movie it will have to further butcher the story, to compensate for the butchery of the first. Heck, I don't think they could make a second movie after this one that follows the books because of the way they butchered the story in this movie.<br /><br />If you interested in this, then just buy the books instead. They hold a much better story, if you don't like reading then have a loved one read them to you. This movie is the first piece of artwork I have ever though of as worthless. If this movie were to disappear from history then our culture would be better off, as watching it will confuse or deter those who would choose to read the books.
B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This movie is a war story. What makes it so strange and surreal, is that the man whom it portrays (the most decorated war hero of WWI) was in fact, a pacifist. Digest that for a few moments, if you will.<br /><br />Truth is stranger than fiction, and this is one of the strangest twists of history you'll ever read about (or see here, in Sergeant York).<br /><br />Now enter Gary Cooper, hand picked by the war hero himself, to play his life in this Hollywood classic. Enter again, Walter Brennan. These actors are amongst  the greatest Hollywood legends ever, and this movie shows you why that was the case.<br /><br />The end of an era has arrived (the close of the 1800's, when men still rode horses, or in buckboards, and carried the six-gun in a holster, a common sight back then).<br /><br />The 19th century has slipped over the horizon. It's the 1900's now (still over 100 years ago at this writing). But the old never goes away all at once.<br /><br />A young drinking farmer boy, by the name of Alvin York, is out with his friends, shootin' up the town -- disrupting a church service, and raisin' hell. He (finally) gets \\"religion\\" and alas, becomes a pacifist of all things \\"thou shalt not kill\\".<br /><br />WWI has now erupted overseas -- and this young farmer boy, Alvin, through a strange twist of fate, is catapulted into international celebrity, by becoming our nation's greatest war hero, and decorated with the highest honors (Congressional Medal of Honor) for valor! How did that happen? A pacifist, you say???<br /><br />This true story will make you weep, it will make you laugh -- it will make you feel proud to be an American!

B003B02O14|4.0|I have read many of John Grisham's books. I like his style and the way he tells a story. He keeps you turning the pages and leaves you wanting more !!
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins<br /><br />For the last time, at least with this trilogy, I almost didn't read this book because everyone was reading it.  New York Times best sellers most often don't make my cut.  The dystopian world featured in the first  and second book finds itself under attack by a mythical adversary and a Hunger Games Victor rallying cry.<br /><br />Once again I must point out that as good as the plot may be, the characterizations are what make this trilogy so compelling.  It also has such a wide appeal.  I have talked about the books with my 30 something daughter-in-law and my 13 year old grandson.  We have all found things we both like and dislike in the books.<br /><br />You find yourself deeply involved with imaginary characters.  There is probably a diagnostic term for this but it certainly makes for an intense reading experience.  I also like the number of morality plays that can be used to engender discussions in education.  My grandson was assigned Catching Fire as a summer reading assignment.  The books just reek with discussion topics suitable for middle school.  I also enjoyed the way the titles were clarified with actions in the books.<br /><br />I really did not expect to like this series.  I sniffed with distain at the Twilight series and expected the same level of drivel here.  (Please keep in mind I did not read any of the Twilight books nor see any of the movies and only perceive it as drivel based on the ranting of those I know who have reveled in both the books and movies.  Like 50 Shades, it just doesn't seem like my cuppa.)  I was pleasantly and quite thoroughly surprised with the Hunger Game Trilogy.<br /><br />I highly enjoyed the book and I recommend it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is amazing.I love it;plus if you love puzzles you can do a lot of puzzles on this app.

B00006SFLV|5.0|Angela Chase is a stunning portrayal of teenage-angst in the 1990's. With her friends Rickie, Rayanne, Sharon and her infamous crush Jordan Catalano they wade through the murky waters of the teenage years with unabashing honesty and sometimes painful realness. Touching on topics like drug and alcohol use, homelessness, violence, and sexuality, the series does a great job at showing what it's like to be a youth in 90s society. Great character evolution and a bit of a \\"plotless\\" plot, I was captivated from the first episode. The only thing that wore on me was the lack of Tino, who was mentioned in almost every episode but whom we never actually saw. Worth watching.

0345803485|1.0|How is it possible for a book to get all the way to publication without the author, an editor, an assistant editor, a fact checker or a copywriter looking at a freaking map? According to this book Seattle and Vancouver are the same place, and Portland, Oregon is in Canada! (\\"They entered U.S. airspace, but her heart was still in Oregon\\") Forget that all the \\"American\\" characters speak in the queen's English, using British colloquialisms that no American would ever use, the people who put this book out didn't even bother to check their geography. This book is the epitome of lazy writing, but the fact that it got past the editors and everyone else is mind boggling. This book must have been written, published and distributed in a week, if that long. What a great scam this is!

B005LAIGW8|3.0|This is an OK movie as the sequel to the first Ghost Rider movie.  It is more in the line of following the original comic book series and it is easy to see how tortured Johnny Blaze (Nicholas Cage) is trying to keep the demon inside under control. He is dragged into a conflict when the devil tries to have a son on earth to become a new vessel for all of his power.  The young boy is being guarded by monks and Moreau (Idris Elba) to keep the devil from fulfilling an ancient prophecy.<br /><br />The devil's minions strike at the monastery to kidnap the boy but he is saved by Moreau and the boy escapes with his mother.  Moreau recruits Johnny Blaze to help save the boy with the promise of removing the devil's curse on Johnny that makes him the devil's bounty hunter for evil souls...<br /><br />There are some good chase scenes in the movie and the special effects are not bad.  The acting was where this movie was weak for me and Nicholas Cage just seemed to do everything over the top of what was necessary. He is an enigma to me in that some of his movies are really good and others I just wonder how he became a lead actor.<br /><br />The sad part of this movie was that the script had real potential and it would have been easy for the young boy, Danny (Fergus Riodan) to be set up as the Ghost Rider's replacement or a formidable enemy for a revitalization of the series with new blood.  Nicholas is not getting any younger and his acting in this movie is one of the things that brought it down to a lower rating.  Perhaps it was the Director's fault for the over acting.<br /><br />If you are a Ghost rider fan you will still like this but it could have been so much better!
0811871258|5.0|Though no expert on the current art scene, one glimpse through these pages can easily make a doubter a believer regarding what's out there now. No, it's not only 100-plus year old pictures that are worth a look!  This artist seems to be at home in just about every mode of the brush, with hints and stabs at surrealism, realism, classicism, and just about anything else you can think of! Not to mention shades of Escher, Warhol, Dali, Pollack, even Vermeer, among many others; of course this oddly endearing style is all the artist's own...And you can buy this for less than $40.00! Amazing, given that this phenomenal art book will surely last at least a hundred years...One small gripe...The accompanying text is in small, light gray letters, slightly hard to follow for me without strong reading glasses. Maybe done on purpose to keep the viewer's eyes from drifting from the main course: the art photos of course~!
0345803507|5.0|This trilogy was rated as erotica, romance and suspense and it is labeled correctly as you get all of that in this trilogy.

B001AJJTW0|5.0|Bob Marley & The Wailers were truly a historical phenomenon that comes along a very few times.  They brought a sound and belief system that truly shocked the world and  became one of the few acts in music history to introduce a genre of music to the masses.  LEGEND is a perfectly crafted album of some of their most wonderful and meaningful songs packaged in such a way that you get a synopsis of how truly incredible this band and Robert Nesta Marley were.  Both have reached mythic proportions since Bob's death in 1981 and this album was a celebration of his songs and message.  The success of this album can't be understated, it has spent close to 1,000 weeks on the billboard charts & another 760 plus weeks on the U.K. charts selling over 25 millions copies worldwide.<br /><br />Bob was a true poet, revolutionary, prophet and musical genius whose songs touched people right where they were and still have a profound effect even to this day.  His songs helped to not only entertain but educate and consolidate, they were truly songs of revolutions around the world.  The revolution was not just a physical or military one but mostly revolutions of ideals, thoughts and perceptions.  He, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer were all 3 fantastic songwriters who lived what they wrote thus lending to it's legitimacy.  Reggae as a genre truly came to the mainstream with this band and saw a tremendous development from Island Music to a form of expression that was adopted by most all of the top acts of that day in one way or another.<br /><br />Most of the songs are from Marley's albums after Tosh and Wailer had left to form their own bands, however, there are classics like \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\"; \\" Stir It Up\\" and \\"I Shot The Sheriff\\" from the time period when all three legends were still together.  One of the constants is/was the songwriting and Marley stood front and center.  He truly was a songwriter unlike no other, his songs and mode of delivery were truly spectacular and easily translated into his live shows which were themselves legendary and he still holds several records for attendance in many venues he performed in.  I remember growing up how much of major thing it was when he released an album as we really hadn't heard anything like that before.<br /><br />This album is a fitting tribute to the man, his band, message and life.  The world was truly blessed to have experienced the music of Bob Marley and The Wailers.  We will never see anything like them again and I am so happy that I was alive to experience the magic of their music, message and the affect it had on many lives worldwide.  They truly changed more that just music, they changed the way many thought and their songs gave strength, hope and fire to many an oppressed people to, as the song says, GET UP, STAND UP!into his live shows which were themselves legendary and he still holds several records for attendance in many venues he performed in.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|If you like ACTION, the watch this movie.  Much of the storyline has built up from the previous movies of the individual heroes that are in this one, so if you want more story line, but sure to watch them first.  If you do decide to watch them the best order for viewing is:<br />1.  Ironman<br />2.  The Incredible Hulk (staring Edward Norton, not the one titled simply Hulk)<br />3.  Ironman II<br />4.  Thor<br />5.  Captain America:  The First Avenger<br />6.  and finally...Marvel's The Avengers<br />As a self-contained movie, the story line leaves out much, but that is because the veiwer is expected to have seen the list of movies above.  It is my highest recommendation to watch all of these first.  There are many interactions between the characters that are entertaining and can be appreciated if you take the time to get into the spirit of things by watching them all.
B000008I5I|5.0|SONGS OF FREEDOM is an outstanding box set and collection of songs that gives the listener a wonderful overview of not only the growth of this band but of Reggae as a whole. There are 4 cd's in the set and they are broken down into the 2 phases of the band, in particular Marely's, career. The 1st cd takes you back to the beginnings of the band in the 1960's into 1970 and some of the early origins of Reggae. Many of these songs were written and recorded when The Wailers were signed to the legendary Lee \\"Scratch\\" Perry's record label in Jamaica and is what I would consider \\"hard core\\" or the most authentic form of Reggae. I absolutely love it, I will say that if you haven't heard any of the early Wailer material it may be a shock upon 1st listen but I think it's well worth you listening to it over and over as it's truly wonderful and gives you a great feel for the early formation of the genre.<br /><br />The second cd picks up with the bands work from 1971 into the the mid 1970's when they began to be noticed outside of the Island Nations and actually traveled abroad and began recording in studios with more up to date equipment thus allowing for a more full and rich sound to their music. The songwriting also began to delve into deeper and more reflective themes. One of my favorite songs from this time period is \\"Guava Jelly\\" and an Acoustic Melody of several songs that are truly fantastic. This is also the time period when they would release their mainstream masterpieces CATCH A FIRE & BURNIN both of which would explode on the mainstream and shock the world with a message and sound it had not heard prior to. This was, unfortunately, also the time period where Peter & Bunny would leave the band.<br /><br />The 3rd cd is the beginning of Bob's ascendance into legendary status following the break up of the original band, the albums and songs he would record and release during this time period would take him to places few had ever seen as far as influence and artistic expression. Their are some wonderful live versions of songs on the whole set and this cd has a live version of one of his most popular hits \\"No Woman, No Cry.\\" Other classics on the cd are \\"Who The Cap Fit\\"; \\"Johnny Was\\"; \\"Exodus\\" and the incredible \\"Three Little Birds.\\" Although both Bunny and Peter would release outstanding material during this period too, both of which deserved far more praise than currently given, this was Bob's time and he took full advantage of it with one great album full of wonderful songs after another. The albums covered during this time period are NATTY DREAD, RASTAMAN VIBRATION & EXODUS the latter of which was voted by Time Magazine as the most influential album of the 20th century.<br /><br />The 4th and final cd covers the albums released in the final years of Marley's life which include KAYA; SURVIVAL & UPRISING. These are some of my personal favorites from Bob and truly saw him writing a wide variety of songs above and beyond revolution and mystical beliefs. He was truly an all around man, a poetic man, a soul man, an herbsman, a ladies man and a revolutionary man and the songs during this stage of his life explore all of those themes in great detail. One of the crown jewels on this cd is the live version of \\"Redemption Song\\" sung at his final performance in Pittsburgh PA.

0385528752|4.0|I loved this book for many reasons: it was entertaining, enlightening and provided great insight into why it is difficult to make change. My only complaint is that for the most part, the book did not provide real solutions to personal dilemmas in making change. It provided a very loose framework which one could apply to situations, but most of it tended to be centered around corporations and non-profits.
B005H7WDTC|3.0|These are willful interpretations that - IMHO - say a lot about Christian Thielemann and, occasionally, something important about Ludwig van Beethoven as well.<br /><br />The performances of the earlier symphonies themselves are episodic, to put it kindly. It's one thing to fail to successfully link the sections of a given symphonic movement together into a whole, thereby unwittingly allowing us hear the seams in a work. It's quite another thing to create seams where none previously existed. This is a real debit in Thielemann's overall approach to the earlier works, IMO, especially as his performances of the later symphonies reflect a more traditional and moderate (read: successful) approach to Beethoven.<br /><br />In the plus column, Thielemann observes nearly every repeat in every symphony (except the 7th and the 9th - more about this below), and the Vienna Philharmonic sounds wonderful throughout.<br /><br />On to the works themselves:<br /><br />Thielemann has no love and carries no brief for Symphonies 1 & 2. I get the feeling that CT would have been fine recording only Symphonies 3 - 9 were that an option. Sym I/iii is raced through with little regard for nuance of any sort. Ensemble problems abound, mostly on the small scale, but they are there.<br /><br />The overt classicism of the two early symphonies holds no enchantment for Maestro Thielemann. Fast movements are uncomfortably fast, with the slow movements being self-consciously slow. I'm not hearing any great interpretive insights in either symphony. Thielemann seems more concerned with doing a physical impersonation of the \\"relaxed energy\\" conducting styles of Carlos Keliber and Wilhelm Furtw&auml;ngler than attending to what's going on right in front of him. Unfortunately for the listener, Thielemann's relaxation often verges on the indifferent. To me, the relaxation comes off as a cover for a mild narcissism that - while expected in conductors - is striving here for new modes of expression. I wonder if, perhaps, Thielemann will revisit these works later in his career and find more in them than he does at this point in time.<br /><br />The Eroica is the most successful performance out of the first 3 symphonies. I'm surprised Theilemann didn't double the winds in this symphony. It would have helped the balances in the tutti sections. The first movement suffers from Thielemann pulling the tempos around for no apparent reason other than that the orchestra will follow him. The second movement has suitable gravitas: I felt that the placement of the triplet pick ups in the double basses weren't always placed accurately. The orchestral sound gets a bit rough edged in the louder sections of this symphony. The third movement is highly energetic, with the French horns shining in their exposed calls.<br /><br />In the Eroica finale, Thielemann provides an extended - and meaningless - unwritten pause before the oboe solo at the Poco andante (bar 348). The camera lingers on Thielemann as he freezes and extends this silence well beyond normal limits. It's a real, \\"look at me! I'm Christian Thielemann!\\" moment. You might think that your BD player has suddenly frozen up.<br /><br />The oboe solo is then launched...and we get more extended visuals of Thielemann conducting. The camera then cuts away to the horns, who are providing supporting harmony for the oboist. The camera next cuts to the clarinet, back to the horns, etc. Who we don't catch a glimpse of is the effing solo oboist! At least not until the very end of the solo, when the camera gives a brief shot of his hands positioned on his horn (without showing his face).<br /><br />Now, I'm no Agnes Meth - the person who directed this video - but I have to ask: why wouldn't you show the oboist during this solo? Is that too common an idea for this video? Are we making a statement by playing against expectations? I'd like to know.<br /><br />Throughout these recordings (Symphonies 1 - 3), Thielemann seems particularly unconcerned about maintaining energy through the ends of phrases when those phrases encompass the \\"fall\\" that attends the natural rise and fall of a musical line. Oh, he's fine on the \\"rise\\" part, where energy is supplied in abundance. But when the musical line falls, the energy underneath it can sag incredibly. It's as if CT's thoughts are focussed on the \\"next point of interest\\" for him, a point that perhaps lies 8 to 12 bars in the future. For a person who thinks he's emulating Furtw&auml;ngler, it's disappointing to hear the results of a conductor NOT being in the moment, at least when that moment represents the fall of a musical line. It's one thing to have a performance going on in your head that isn't being reflected by the group you're leading. It's quite another thing when the group you're leading is the Vienna Philharmonic, an orchestra whose pedigree in Beethoven performance SHOULD serve to engage even a conductor who has been leading Beethoven performances for decades. Thielemann? Not so much.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, CT has no problems achieving an overly inflected diminuendo when it is indicated in the score. His diminuendi may be more diminuendi than those of the king of diminuendi! No sagging here. Too bad he doesn't avoid the energy sag elsewhere, ie: where a diminuendo occurs as the result of the musical line, where the composer didn't feel the need to mark a diminuendo because one doesn't mark those things that musicians sort of \\"get\\" - hors concours - because they're musicians.<br /><br />Lest you think I'm singling out CT for such criticism, this problem seems to afflict many of today's conductors. It's more glaring when set against the work of the old-school conductors like Karajan, Walter, Szell and Bernstein, who paid attention and took care of such things as part of their normal modus operandi.<br /><br />Finally, it bears mentioning that Thielemann has a penchant for speeding up and slowing down at cadential points for no apparent reason other than the fact that the music has reached such a point. These gestures add nothing to the music. In fact, they serve only to turn the spotlight onto CT in a \\"look what I can do/control\\" way. I hate to say it, but his is the kind of almost rank musical amateurism one encounters at the local band concert in the park gazebo, where Our Illustrious Locally Born-n-Bred Maestro leads the troops through their paces, imposing his idea of what constitutes an interpretive touch on the proceedings. One would have thought that the massive corrective to such provincialism that the musical world called Arturo Toscanini would have banished such gestures to the remotest of musical outposts. But, no. Here, we are through the looking glass, apparently with unwitting provincialism now channeled through an intellectual process and exiting the other end as the new, studied and intellectually embraced form of provincialism that passes for modern-day musical insight, on display for all to see and hear within the hallowed walls of the Musikvereinsaal itself!<br /><br />Sound on the disc is excellent, as is the HD picture quality.<br /><br />Coming to the BD of Symphonies 4 - 6 immediately after the disappointing disc of Symphonies 1-3, I was pleasantly surprised with Thielemann's approach to the Fourth. In fact, let me state right now that the first disc of this set isn't at all representative of the performances encoded on the other 2 BDs in this cycle, which are much more enjoyable, traditional and free of mannerisms, and that I found to be well worth viewing and hearing.<br /><br />Back to the performance of the 4th: here, the conductor is fully engaged in the proceedings in a way he was not in the first three symphonies of the cycle. Tempi are more judiciously chosen than they were on Disc 1, and save for Thielemann's trademark accelerandi and rallentandi at cadence points (gestures that do nothing to enhance the music), this performance is pretty straight forward.<br /><br />Thielemann obviously sees the second movement as the core of this symphony, and he lingers over the movement, bestowing ample helpings of love and insight along the way. There is some impressive playing here from the wind soloists - particularly the first clarinet and bassoon - who are often asked to play so quietly that lesser players would find their reeds failing to vibrate. It's a testament to the skill and art of these players that they can maintain a steady and beautiful tone at a dynamic level that strains the physics that lie behind playing reed instruments. Bravi tutti!<br /><br />The third and fourth movements are simply delightful, reminding me once again why I find this to be my favorite symphony out of the 9. No less an authority than Karajan felt the 4th to be the most-difficult Beethoven symphony to pull of in concert, yet pull it off Thielemann does, in no small part due to the virtuosity of the Vienna Philharmonic. I'm also happy to report that the famous bassoon solo in the 4th movement is not only played for all it's worth, but that the video director allows us to watch the player going through his paces. That director would be the same Agnes Meth who failed to show the oboist going through the paces of his solo in the finale of the Eroica.<br /><br />After the pleasant surprise of the 4th, Thielemann's 5th comes off as the weakest link in his cycle. The symphony is kick started by Thielemann launching the first movement before the applause that greeted his assuming the podium has subsided. There's a good generalized energy throughout the first movement. But, alas, we soon encounter the sags in energy that afflicted his performances of the First and Second Symphonies. It's a strange phenomenon: in tuttis, the brass peal forth, but the string body seems to lose the edge to its sound that is necessary to keep pace with and provide a counterweight to the brass. One would think the aggressive energy of this movement was self sustaining. Thielemann shows us that we've been taking for granted the performances by conductors who don't let the energy sag in this movement. At the end of the day, Thielemann's approach to this movement doesn't ever gel into a cohesive whole.<br /><br />There are also changes to the wind personnel, and not for the better. The first-chair oboist is a much-inferior player to the man who graced the earlier works. The exposed oboe solo in V/i is weak and watery. His work in the 6th symphony is also underpowered, stringy and bereft of opulence. A bad choice.<br /><br />The second movement of the Fifth fares well, but it comes off as being even more episodic than it usually is as Thielemann bends a few tempi, extends phrases and indulges his soloists. Overall, there's nothing to really complain about. Just the renewed belief that most conductors miss the opportunity to make a bit more of this movement, as does Maestro Thielemann.<br /><br />The third movement falls just short of being a real winner. I could have used more presence from the French horns when they announce their big moment that breaks the quiet tension of the opening bars. Thielemann adopts a slightly slower and steadier tempo when the double basses start their virtuosic lick, which - while adding clarity - puts a bit of a straight jacket on the upward rushes of the violins. There's no edge or sparkle to their sound. Happily, Thielemann does NOT take the unwritten (and unwanted and unnecessary) repeat in this movement that seems to be *de rigueur* with the HIP crowd. Thank you!<br /><br />The transition to the Finale is clear, but still mysterious. Not as mysterious as Karajan, but good enough.<br /><br />The Finale itself is launched at a broad tempo that had me salivating at the possibilities. Alas, by the 6th bar, Thielemann has accelerated the tempo into what we normally get in 98% of recordings. Rats! Another opportunity missed! The two subsequent repeats of these opening bars (CT takes the repeat in this movement and the first movement, BTW) find Thielemann trying to again rein in the tempo, but with even less success than he did on its first iteration. One wonders - why even bother? Much of the finale comes off as a mad scramble, with lapses in ensemble mitigated only by the wall of sound coming from the speakers. At the end of it all, we've been treated to a decidedly run-of-the-mill run through of the piece, with a few errant gestures here and there standing in for involvement and depth. I didn't get the sense that Thielemann necessarily likes this piece. Perhaps he thinks it's over done at this point in history.<br /><br />Thielemann definitely likes the Pastorale, and here, it receives an excellent all-around reading, though I'm beginning to believe that this piece is perhaps bullet proof. One wishes we had a different first oboist in this performance, as he has plenty of solo work to do. CT avoids his tendency to indulge himself and the orchestra in meaningless interpretive gestures. Tempi for each movement are well-judged, and balances are exemplary. That said, the playing doesn't have the sense of spontaneity that marks all really great performances of the Pastorale. The humor of the country band in the third movement is an on-paper humor here, not a fully realized aural humor. The strings make no effort to imitate the raw drone of a hurdy gurdy in the opening of the 5th movement. The 4th-movement's storm is more of a summer shower than the tree-toppling cataclysm we get from Karajan and others. Overall, the playing is a hair too cultured: a busman's holiday of a trip to the country, not necessarily a week spent working at the dude ranch.<br /><br />Still, I would recommend this BD for the great sound and picture quality, even if the performances have been bettered elsewhere. Others may not be as off-put as am I about certain aspects of Thielemann's interpretive choices.<br /><br />BD 3 gives us the final three symphonies in the cycle.<br /><br />Thielemann and the Vienna Philharmonic turn in an exemplary performance of the 7th Symphony. It's the most-straight-forward performance to date in the cycle. Thielemann's tempo for the opening \\"Poco sostenuto\\" is a bit faster than most, and it builds confidently into the \\"Vivace\\" proper. He ignores the repeat (bar 176) that would return us back to the start of the Vivace and moves ahead into the remainder of the movement. Everything is well played and well balanced. Our oboist from the Pastorale even does a better job here (though I could have done with more wind presence throughout the Symphony).<br /><br />The famous \\"Allegretto\\" is very enjoyable, with Thielemann taking a moderate view of the staccato markings that sit over the string parts. No complaints here. Just sit back and enjoy a great orchestra playing some great music to a tee.<br /><br />The ensuing \\"Presto\\" is crisp, clean and exciting, even at a slightly slower tempo than the norm. While Thielemann observes most of the small repeats within sections of this movement, he ignores the \\"big\\" first repeat (bar 145) that leads back to the edge of the movement, and takes the second ending into the \\"Assai meno presto.\\" This more-relaxed section of the movement is a real winner, with the brass ringing forth in splendor when required. The string writing in the off beats is well-weighted here. It all adds up to a powerful - and life-affirming - bit of music making.<br /><br />The Finale is played for all its worth, and at a fair clip. Not as manic as Karajan and Abbado in their later Berlin recordings, but exciting, none the less. Thieleman ignores the \\"Dal segno\\" first ending (bar 121) that would return us to the start of the movement - a choice that I generally agree with - and forges on. The only debit in the movement is Thielemann's slowing the tempo to accommodate the quick 16th-note writing for the strings whenever it occurs, while accelerating in places free of these specific technical challenges. I would have preferred a steady tempo that accommodated both. But over all, there's little to complain about and much to admire here, as Thielemann seems to be truly coming into his own in the later Beethoven symphonies.<br /><br />The Eighth Symphony also finds Thielemann on his best behavior, turning in yet another straight forward interpretation. There are many, many fine recordings of this symphony, a symphony that seems to be more appreciated than it is loved, and that has always suffered in the shadow of the 9th that follows it. Thielemann's performance marks another recommendable addition to the catalog, and in fantastic sight and sound, to boot.<br /><br />Thielemann offers one of the best 9ths to come down the pike in a number of years. It's well-balanced, lyrical and energetic.<br /><br />Those expecting the cataclysmic look into the abyss as provided by Bernstein's or Karajan's approach to the first movement will need to look elsewhere. There's no subtext to Thielemann's approach. This is absolute music, as it were. Where some see a Genesis-like beginning of the universe, Thielemann sees D Minor. There's nothing wrong with this approach, though it does tend to play down dramatic elements and effects that loom large in many other versions. There are the usual Theilemann underlinings of tempo changes and dynamics that I've come to expect in his Beethoven, along with his ignoring certain indications in Beethoven's own hand, opting to go his own way, as it were. Once one accepts that reality, things do fall into place.<br /><br />The Second movement (Molto vivace) is just a tad slower than most, and that makes for a good deal of clarity in hearing the orchestra lines. Thielemann takes the first repeat (bar 150) that takes us back to the beginning of the movement, while ignoring the additional big first repeat (bar 388) later on. Overall, very enjoyable on every level.<br /><br />The third movement is treated lovingly by Thielemann, reinforcing my feeling that this movement is the real center of this symphony. There are too many nice touches here to enumerate them all. Suffice to say that I felt compelled to listen to this movement again when it came to its conclusion...but I couldn't do that, as Thielemann segues directly into the Finale.<br /><br />The Finale is very well done, and one can basically just sit back and enjoy the proceedings. The solo quartet is a bit above average, with the bass being too light, the soprano being too physically manic (though it doesn't effect her singing) the tenor being quite good and the alto...well, who ever really hears the alto? The chorus is also quite good and offers in-tune singing and tonal variety in abundance.<br /><br />As usual there are a few novel choices by Thielemann. His solution to bridging the tempo change between the slower \\"Alla marcia\\" of the tenor solo and the ensuing (and quick) Fugato is to accelerate to the quick tempo of the Fugato over the final bars of the music for the tenor soloist and men's chorus (bars 96-101 of the Alla marcia section). It's not the usual solution, but it works. And while some may quibble that his final \\"Maestoso\\" is too Maestoso (it is, if one follows what Beethoven actually indicated), it's perfectly acceptable and in line with how most conductors treat this final choral utterance before the closing Prestissimo.<br /><br />Over all, this is a pretty good set, even when put against the non-Blu Ray/video options out there. That said, it is pricey (my son got it for me as a Father's Day gift for $97, but the price has now climbed to $114 on amazon for the complete Blu Ray cycle). For those with unlimited funds, I would say go for it. For those on a stricter budget, I would suggest trying the discs in their reverse order, with the third BD (Symphonies 7 - 9) being the best and the first BD (Symphonies 1 -3 ) being the runt of the litter. Were I looking for ONE Beethoven Symphony cycle on video, I would probably recommend Abbado's BPO version from Rome, though there is no BD option rightnow, only DVD (On edit: the Abbado set was released on BD in 2013).<br /><br />I've watched a few snippets from the various \\"Discovering Beethoven\\" extras included on each BD - they're rudimentary stuff aimed at the novice listener. Nothing wrong with that, I guess, if novice listeners make up the market for classical BDs.find Thielemann trying to again rein in the tempo, but with even less success than he did on its first iteration. One wonders - why even bother? Much of the finale comes off as a mad scramble, with lapses in ensemble mitigated only by the wall of sound coming from the speakers. At the end of it all, we've been treated to a decidedly run-of-the-mill run through of the piece, with a few errant gestures here and there standing in for involvement and depth. I didn't get the sense that Thielemann necessarily likes this piece. Perhaps he thinks it's over done at this point in history.<br /><br />Thielemann definitely likes the Pastorale, and here, it receives an excellent all-around reading, though I'm beginning to believe that this piece is perhaps bullet proof. One wishes we had a different first oboist in this performance, as he has plenty of solo work to do. CT avoids his tendency to indulge himself and the orchestra in meaningless interpretive gestures. Tempi for each movement are well-judged, and balances are exemplary. That said, the playing doesn't have the sense of spontaneity that marks all really great performances of the Pastorale. The humor of the country band in the third movement is an on-paper humor here, not a fully realized aural humor. The strings make no effort to imitate the raw drone of a hurdy gurdy in the opening of the 5th movement. The 4th-movement's storm is more of a summer shower than the tree-toppling cataclysm we get from Karajan and others. Overall, the playing is a hair too cultured: a busman's holiday of a trip to the country, not necessarily a week spent working at the dude ranch.<br /><br />Still, I would recommend this BD for the great sound and picture quality, even if the performances have been bettered elsewhere. Others may not be as off-put as am I about certain aspects of Thielemann's interpretive choices.<br /><br />BD 3 gives us the final three symphonies in the cycle.<br /><br />Thielemann and the Vienna Philharmonic turn in anexemplary performance of the 7th Symphony. It's the most-straight-forward performance to date in the cycle. Thielemann's tempo for the opening \\"Poco sostenuto\\" is a bit faster than most, and it builds confidently into the \\"Vivace\\" proper. He ignores the repeat (bar 176) that would return us back to the start of the Vivace and moves ahead into the remainder of the movement. Everything is well played and well balanced. Our oboist from the Pastorale even does a better job here (though I could have done with more wind presence throughout the Symphony).<br /><br />The famous \\"Allegretto\\" is very enjoyable, with Thielemann taking a moderate view of the staccato markings that sit over the string parts. No complaints here. Just sit back and enjoy a great orchestra playing some great music to a tee.<br /><br />The ensuing \\"Presto\\" is crisp, clean and exciting, even at a slightly slower tempo than the norm. While Thielemann observes most of the small repeats within sections of this movement, he ignores the \\"big\\" first repeat (bar 145) that leads back to the edge of the movement, and takes the second ending into the \\"Assai meno presto.\\" This more-relaxed section of the movement is a real winner, with the brass ringing forth in splendor when required. The string writing in the off beats is well-weighted here. It all adds up to a powerful - and life-affirming - bit of music making.<br /><br />The Finale is played for all its worth, and at a fair clip. Not as manic as Karajan and Abbado in their later Berlin recordings, but exciting, none the less. Thieleman ignores the \\"Dal segno\\" first ending (bar 121) that would return us to the start of the movement - a choice that I generally agree with - and forges on.

B004XGN8W4|5.0|I travel a lot with the military and with only receiving the case recently it has already proven itself as a valuable piece of luggage.  It can be used at airports to help time past or anywhere.  The screen does show a few lines up close but only a idiot would stare at a screen gaming from a foot away, at 4 to 5 feet you still see plenty as I play only first person shooters or RPGs.  The case itself is sturdy enough to hold/protect the system and tv.  Has plenty of side storage to hold all cables required as well as one controller.  Only downfall is it lacks space to carry individual games but I have no problem carrying games and any other accessories with me in my carry on backpack.  I rate this product so far as 5 out of 5 for it does what it was designed for and was cheap enough that I didn't have to invest and build a pelican case for.  Thank you GAEMS!
0788859544|3.0|It played ok through most of the movie, but continually froze up near the end.  I tried wiping the disc as suggested, but no improvement.  I know they have a return policy, but I am too busy for a $15 purchase.  I should have bought the new DVD.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Everyone continues to read this book and rate it badly but there is nothing that bad about it. It isn't for everyone should be the proper way to put it but not to discourage everyone. I read reviews but once I read the sample, I had to buy the book and I finished it in 3 days, I couldn't put it down! Yes I agree, some words are overused but the book has a storyline to it and the sex scenes make it even better. Read the sample and if you have to, ask someone or look for a sex excerpt online. It isnt for everyone and even though I am not a fan of BDSM, the book is amazing.

B00418NVMQ|5.0|I saw Halestorm in concert on the Mass Chaos tour with Godsmack a couple of months ago and was blown away by them. This band ROCKS in a major way.  I got this CD/DVD because I enjoyed seeing them live and I was not disapointed with this purchase.  Lzzy has such a powerful voice that sounds just as great live as it does on a mixed and perfected CD. She has such energy and she takes the time to interact with the fans.  One of my favorite parts of the DVD was Boom City.  AreJay is a great drummer and during that song he gets to shine.  Another high point is the song Familiar Taste of Poison. The light guitar intro gives Lzzy a chance to show off her haunting and beautiful voice.  The DVD also includes photos and videos for the singles.  If you are a fan of Halestorm, I say get this. It is great!  If you are just starting to listen to them or have never seen them in concert this is a great introduction to Halestorm live.

Great for those long waits at the Doctor's.<br />If you are considering one there are numerous video's on how to operate the Kindle, & how to store books etc. in the Cloud. I like having all the info on a product spelled out clearly before I buy.

Cannot comprehend how this trilogy made it on any book list other than \\"world's poorest written\\" or maybe \\"best written by an author under 15\\".
B007P6VLRS|5.0|First, I should make it clear that I'm probably a little biased when it comes to the Smashing Pumpkins. I have loved them ever since I heard the first notes of Mellon Collie back in high school, and I've been downright obsessed with them since 2000 when I heard they were about to break up and so I started to make up for lost time. Since 1988, Billy Corgan has released over 400 original songs, and I can honestly say I love every single one of them. That probably isn't normal. Yet, I do feel I am capable of being objective about the guy, so here goes...<br /><br />I don't need to tell you whether or not the album is good because, of course it's good. But, how good? After four listens, I can already say it's easily the best body of work they've put together since the band's return in 2007 (\\"Owata\\" is probably their best individual song). Where it ranks amongst their highest-regarded albums from the 90s probably can't be determined for another several months, if not years, but this is a very good album. It's certainly the best-produced album Billy has ever made. Every SP album has little production quirks that separate it from the others, but this one is fairly straight-forward and just beautiful to listen to. As much as I love the risks Billy has always taken in the studio, this is what I've wanted from him for a long time. The band is so tight and it's great to be able to hear everything that's going on. My favorite version of the band was just before the breakup with Billy, James, Jimmy and Melissa Auf der Maur, but Jeff and Nicole are the best musicians to ever play with Billy at their respective instruments, and they both make their presence felt on the album, especially Nicole. Her bass playing is distinctive and melodic, but I really have to give her props for her backing vocals. The fact that she does away with the need for a \\"choir of Billys\\" makes her worth every cent she's being paid and more. I guess the only thing I miss a little bit are Jimmy's flourishesthat I know would have been a part of these songs, but Mike is a great drummer. It's just hard to follow the likes of Jimmy Chamberlin.<br /><br />One thing I complain about with a lot of bands I have liked over the years is how they started off young and angry, and 20 years later they are old and still angry. I can't understand how people don't evolve a bit more in that amount of time. But Billy is not one of those artists stuck in the past and still drawing inspiration from the same places he found it when he was 18. He seems to be a happy guy now...he's comfortable in his own skin, and that shows in his music. In \\"Oceania\\" he has created a truly meaningful piece of work nearly 20 years after perhaps the most important album of his career, and not many artists can claim that.

0345423496|2.0|Arthur Clarke made a name for himself by writing science fiction that combined imagination with an adherence to real science and an exceptionally accurate depiction of physics.  This result is that he has produced very believable and often very accurate stories about the future of the space program.  Thus it was with great anticipation that I picked up 3001 to discover what Clarke had envisioned for the future of space travel after a thousand years of human and scientific evolution.  Despite a few intriguing ideas, the overall result was disappointing.<br /><br />It was Clarke who pointed to the astonishingly short period of time between the early efforts of flight by the Wright Brothers and the landing on the moon to suggest that our next century could see travel throughout the solar system.  Yet in 3001, we are left to discover that Clarke feels the following nine centuries would not yield any significant advancements in space travel beyond what he covered in the first three books.  We are not given any real significant details about the monoliths nor Europa, instead we are left with a plot line that carried none of the sense of adventure so central to the original Space Odyssey books.  The result was that I was left wondering if Clarke merely rushed to write the final book without bothering to really examine the possible ramifications of what ten centuries of exponential technological advancement might produce.<br /><br />This book might have been saved had it been labeled 2151 or at least a date not too far off from the third book which could have made the story more plausible relative to the scientific progress of the first three books.  But Clarke choose to reach so far into the future that anything short of mind blowing advancements did not fit with the other books. This was by far the weakest book of what could have been the most incredible science fiction series in history.  For someone who was able to produce such fascinating writing and content about space, there is no way to describe this concluding book with anything other than disappointment.e, there is no way to describe this concluding book with anything other than disappointment.

Add apps to the dock...add MULTIPLE docks...add and DELETE side-swiping panels/home screens...change the grid size of the homescreen panels so you can have any number of icons on each panel...choose which screen is the homescreen so you aren't constantly going back to the middle panel.

0451457994|5.0|Among the large variety of writing styles in science fiction, many authors separate themselves from the pack with their imaginations.  Arthur Clarke, one of the most prominent science fiction writers of the 20th century, separated himself and his works with his technical expertise.  2001: A Space Odyssey is the prime and shining example; a story written about the future of space travel established by real and credible science.<br /><br />Written in the late 60s about the space program in the year 2001, the only real glaring inaccuracy is the time frame (other than the main story line regarding the monoliths, which are purely fictional as intended).  Yet one could easily add a mere 25 or 50 years onto the time frame and its all once more fully credible as a possible or even likely expectation of where science will find itself.  Science fiction is so often plagued by story-lines that run counter to accepted laws of physics only to have the inconsistencies explained away by some yet unknown realm.  Clarke would have none of this, and thus every technical aspect of the book holds up to the laws of physics, adding both credibility and believably to the story.<br /><br />Clarke is short on story yet descriptive in detail which makes for a powerful combination.  The story-line is intriguing and undoubtedly leaves readers wondering about the true possibilities of human evolution.  For those having seen the movie version first (the book and movie were produced concurrently), you will be pleased to find that the book goes much further in depth regarding the finality of the mission, which produced a more compelling story-line.  As one of the most notable science fiction books of all time, 2001: A Space Odyssey does not disappoint.

0307341577|5.0|Using spare descriptions and alternating points of view, Gillian Flynn conjures up a hardscrabble life in the rural midwest that leads to 3 horrific murders and several terminally damaged lives for the rest of the characters.  The author writes some unlikeable characters with such skill that you find yourself hoping that you're wrong, that what you know is going to happen will be averted and there will be a happy ending after all.  The conclusion of the novel is brilliant, one I'd never considered, and showcases this author's writing chops.

B0034G4P8A|3.0|3 1/2 Stars = Very Good<br /><br />With all the comic book hero films coming out, it seems like an onslaught of cinema vigilantism. The super heroes are fighting off all would be terrorist, at the nearest cinemaplex! I guess it is a sign of the times. Many of us living out our own repressed vigilante emotions through the silver screen, or should it be, the 3-D screen? We're also having a lot of fun doing it, but like any genre onslaught, there is a mixed bag of popcorn movies, some freshly popped with the right amount of butter & salt, others with one to many old maids sitting at the bottom of the bag, waiting for you to crack your tooth on.<br /><br />\\"Thor\\" sits at the bottom of the better upper third of the onslaught. The perfect film for that bag of popcorn & large pop that cost you $20 extra. Don't fear though, the sound of the popcorn your chewing inside your mouth won't make you miss any great social commentary.  Then again, with the exception of truly groundbreaking genre films like, \\"Watchmen,\\" & the last two Batman's, these films are not meant to be huge beacons of social commentary. Just sit back & enjoy the fun! \\"Thor\\" does exactly what it sets out to do, a movie for the escapists in all of us. Close to two hours of just sit back & veg out. Sure, it has it themes of arrogance, jealously, love, & heroism, but it does not demand you to sit & watch it five times to catch all the nuances & red herrings. It just wants you to come along for the ride, which is not the greatest thrill ride of the genre, but an enjoyable outing in outer space to the desert of New Mexico.<br /><br />\\"Thor\\" features very good special effects & CGI, more or less, one in the same anymore. It has likeable characters, some down right funny scenes, & Chris Hemsworth plays the role of the lighting god with charisma & a twinkle in his eye, winking away at the audience. I got to say though, when Thor puts on civilian earth clothes, I kept expecting him to grab a guitar & sing a country song, LOL! I think they should've made his hair longer for the role, because he looked more like a country music flavor of the day hunk, than a Viking god, but oh well, that's just me. Oh, there is also a funny reference to King Arthur, as Thor's hammer is protruding from a pillar of rock in the desert. All the local he-men, a four wheel drive pickup truck, whose bed pops off, & Thor himself, try to pull it free from the rock, just like \\"Excalibur,\\" but to no avail. Only the one worthy, will be able to wield the hammer of Thor!<br /><br />In the end, I found \\"Thor\\" to be a very enjoyable, though not an amazing comic book hero film, but I do see where it could go on to something bigger & better, \\"the Avengers.\\" It is definitely a film all ages can & will enjoy, & there is a sequel in the works!<br /><br />Hammer down!g, LOL!

Only the one worthy, will be able to wield the hammer of Thor!<br /><br />In the end, I found \\"Thor\\" to be a very enjoyable, though not an amazing comic book hero film, but I do see where it could go on to something bigger & better, \\"the Avengers.\\" It is definitely a film all ages can & will enjoy, & there is a sequel in the works!<br /><br />Hammer down!

Liz was better in \\"Cat\\" w/Newman but looking stunning, the sexy wild hair and voluptous bod who wouldn't put up with her harranging vocals... guess when u solilloquy with eyes wide open and incessant dialogue makes Burton a brilliant actor, kinda one note imho... DON'T BLINK! recommend for happy marriages....
1612130283|4.0|This is a fun book to read. Not a great work of literature or even what I would call a good book. It has everyone reading it, covered in a brown paper bag cover.  It basically is the same chapter after chapter.  Sex.  Building up to sex.  More sex.  Some people I have talked to call it smut. I don't consider it smut nor do I think it is pornographic.  It's just the same things over and over again.  The story surrounding Anastasia is well written and I can think of many, many other ways to take this story to make it more of a pleasant read.  Yes it is hot and one comes to have feelings for all of the characters.  But it just lacks a real good ending.  Maybe as I read the next two,(MAYBE) I will be able to put this to rest and have some sort of thirst quenching ending to the madness.  Interesting way of writing. Difficult to tell when someone is thinking and when they are speaking, but that might just be my issue.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Reading Gillian Flynn's \\"Gone, Girl\\" is juicy the way reading a Patricia Highsmith crime novel is juicy.<br /><br />Both writers let the guilty parties run away with all the best lines and pull off all the most outrageously ingenious and fiendish acts of retribution or malice. Both women have written exceptional cautionary tales about never, ever giving slight (perceived or real).<br /><br />Nick and Amy Dunne have moved back to Nick's Mississippi River hometown of North Carthage, Mo., to care for his parents who are in ill health. Amy and Nick had successful writing careers in New York until the economy tanked and they both lost their jobs, which represented their only real tether to New York and their Manhattan lifestyle.<br /><br />It's their fifth wedding anniversary and Amy is humming the theme song from (M*A*S*H) - which in itself should tell you something - and cooking up a special breakfast of crepes for her husband. And that's the last we'll see of Amy until, well, read the book and find out.<br /><br />When later that day a neighbor calls Nick in the bar he runs with his twin sister \\"Go\\" (Margo) and says Nick's front door is open and banging, Nick check things out and finds the house ransacked and his wife nowhere in sight; and the longer Amy is missing the more suspicion focuses on the husband, the way it usually does when the tabloids get their teeth into a story.<br /><br />The first half of the thriller \\"Boy Loses Girl,\\" with Nick narrating and Amy recounting her life with Nick in her diary is the better part. It's more tightly wound than the second half when the novel sometimes feels as if it's devolving into a three-part Sunday night HBO series that could have been titled \\"Life on the Mississippi.\\"<br /><br />Throughout, Flynn fills the pages with characters that jump off the page. She's a good storyteller.<br />She's even better at characterization.  For example, meet Tyler. He's a kid and a rookie police officer who appears first sitting around Go's kitchen table. He says exactly one word. Yet in one short exchange Tyler comes alive and gets to be made memorable:<br />\\" \\"This is Tyler,\\" she said. \\"He grew up in Tennessee, he has a horse named Custard--\\"<br />\\"Custer,\\" Tyler said.<br />\\"Custer, and he's allergic to peanuts. Not the horse, but Tyler. Oh, and he has a torn labrum, which is the same injury baseball pitchers get, but he's not sure how he got it.\\"<br />Tyler tried to give me a tough look, ended up watching his well-shined shoes.\\" \\"<br /><br />As we learn more and more about both Nick and Amy and get to know them better, each becomes less and less reliable a narrator and in their actions, less and less sympathetic and yet all the while more intriguing for all their wit and guile.<br /><br />Amy appears to be the smartest of the pair and Nick says he always had the feeling that whenever Amy was about to do something clever, \\"something bad was about to happen.\\" But with every turn of the screw we learn more and more about true character and the true nature of deceit.<br /><br />Until the very end and the ultimate reversal, it's up for grabs who of the pair, Nick or Amy - or maybe someone else entirely - should take the prize for being the most malicious. \\"Gone, Girl,\\" is Gillian Flynn at her most dexterous and most diabolically clever.<br />[4.5 stars for the deceit]s kitchen table.

B0088RQ4X4|5.0|After skimming some critical reviews when the movie was released, I had low expectations for John Carter, but it really is a very, very good movie! The acting was good -- in fact, there were some top-shelf actors here I had no idea were going to be in it, like James Purefoy and Ciaran Hinds, who was Caesar in the wonderful Showtime series, Rome, and the leads, Taylor Kitsch and Lynn Collins, were excellent as well. There were a few good laughs (\\"I'm getting away!\\"), some romance, lots of adventure. I think this could have been a big hit in the US for Disney if they advertised it differently. First of all, from the TV ads and movie previews I saw, I had no idea that John Carter started out as a Civil War soldier. That added an important dimension to his character. Why they would leave that out of the ads and promo, I have no idea. They could have riffed on the Cowboys and Aliens theme and done a much, much better job of promoting John Carter. It's truly a shame it didn't get the box office draw that was hoped for, because it's a fun, solid sci-fi adventure that appeals to the whole family. Oh well -- I hope people take a chance on it in instant video, because it's definitely worth it.

B007VTVG4C|5.0|I first heard of Fiona apple back in 2005 when her album Extraordinary Machine came out, I was simply amazed by her style of music and for the past 7 year i have been eagerly looking forward to her next album to be released.<br />Why it is that all the greatest artist's in the music industry take 5 or more years to release their albums i'll never understand, but if they come out sounding as great as Fiona's new album then i guess it's worth the wait, Fiona's style hasn't changed a bit and is still just as inventive as her first album was.<br />The Vinyl edition sounds incredible and is a welcomed addition to my collection, it also comes with a free MP3 download of the entire album. I have uploaded pictures of the album, enjoy.
B007TBCTRK|4.0|The score for Prometheus sets the tone for each scene of the movie beautifully . Some pieces have optimistic tones while others emit dread and awe . As the years pass the movie as well as its score will receive more praise than they do today just like with Blade Runner and Alien . The score is not quite on par with those written by Jerry Goldsmith or Vangelis of course... but it is enjoyable to be sure !
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a game based on a character that has to run from demon monkey's that are chasing you and you have to outrun them. There are stumps and other objects that you have to jump over and if you trip then you loose the coins that you have gotten. You don't realy loose them but there ate these things that you gain these things and if you trip then you loose them and the monkeys gain up on you. I like this game because to me it has &quot;action&quot; if that's what you would like to call it. Its fun because the higher score that you get the faster that you run. And its kinda hard. I've. had this game for a while but I just found out that at the store you can buy different things other than upgrading your character. You can buy other characters like a girl instead of just the boy. Well I hope my review wasn't to long. :D ;D PEACE OUT

B006RUJST6|5.0|Closest thing to a review I can give you...<br /><br />I got home from work on Friday and nothing that I had on my Nook was sparking my interest, so I hit up my other bloggers in search for *THE* book for the weekend. In all honesty I had no idea what I was looking for, but I have been on a chick/realistic/contemp run here for the past week so I decided to hit that road first. Behold I fall in front of a review for Slammed and it lit that flame for me, so I moved to GoodReads and pulled it up and just about everyone had the same general tone to their reviews, that they were left emotionally dysfunctional post reading, two things happened at this point, One, I doubt, I doubt everything, how can one book really do that, now I have read some earth shattering, sole moving books, but in all honesty the synop didn't totally give me that \\"earth shattering\\" feeling, moving maybe, but not mind bending. Second, my need for emotional stimulation and curiosity got the best of me and I bought it. Now mind you it's like ummm 11pm at this point, yes I do that much searching to find *THE* book sometimes, I'm picky and don't like to be disappointed when I'm in the mood...no, not that \\"in the mood\\", in the mood for a really good book!<br /><br />Ok, ok, I know you want the review...we are getting there I promise...<br /><br />So now its o-dark-thirty and I've just downloaded a book I'm not real sure about, but at this point I just don't care, so I start reading.....<br />the sun comes up...<br />it gets real pretty outside so I move to the deck...<br />the sun goes down and the nasta-bugs come out so I move inside...<br />the sun comes up again...<br />I decide eating is necessary for living...<br />it gets pretty again outside so I move to the deck...<br />the sun goes down...<br />my parents wonder if I've turned into my Nook...<br />I ignore phone calls...<br />I lock myself in my room...<br />then...<br /><br />I was left emotionally dysfunctional...<br /><br />During this time I not only read Slammed, but immediately jumped into Point of Retreat, I had to as the uncontrollable crying left me weak and broken and I needed more, like an addict who just had their stash taken away.<br /><br />I can say that had I just stopped with Slammed, I would still feel just as moved by Colleen Hoover's writing, but between both books, it really did a number on me...and now nothing I say will EVER and I mean EVER relay with the dire extremes that you need to read this, so I will review this...staying true to the book...with a poem, and I apologize now, but I cannot review these books separately as the only thing you need to know is that you should at this point have already made your purchase and be waiting for the book to download, so enjoy the remainder of my post before you get started.

0316044695|2.0|A story narrated in the first person by a real SEAL of a firefight in Afghanistan that lead to the deaths of many SEALs and SF operators.<br />The account of the firefight is interesting, although more interesting is the BUD/UDT training.<br />The rest is a lot of American bravado, short sighted international politics, and many many religious references that really diminishes the value of the book as a first person military history
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was my first try at reading using a Kindle app (for iPhone).  I was very hesitant, but I have to say that I ended up enjoying it a lot.  It's great to be able to change font size and brightness/background so quickly.  I also like the fact that I have the book with me on my phone everywhere I go.<br /><br />As for the book, wow what a page-turner!  I could not stop reading.  I am 26 and was worried that this book would be to \\"juvenile\\" for me, but there are a lot of mature themes and scenes in the book.  There is a good amount of violence, described in great detail at some points.  I would highly recommend this book for teens and adults as well.  I think there are a lot of life lessons to be learned by teens who read this book.  The themes are extremely rooted in the story, and the plot seems realistic enough to really make you think about what we value as a society.  I immediately bought the second book upon completing this one.  Bravo, Suzanne Collins!!
B0083SBM7Q|4.0|Here I'll try to help those who aren't dedicated followers of the Marvel Comics franchise decide whether to see this movie while it's still in theaters, along with whether to buy it. These aren't questions for the fanboys. They're going to see and/or buy the DVD of this regardless, as its huge ticket sales attest already.<br /><br />But what about the rest of us? You wouldn't even be reading this unless you felt some desire to occasionally see a big action movie with fabulous 3D special effects and charismatic stars.<br /><br />But you don't see most of them, because they're just so painfully stoopid, with 2D characterizations and a plot that just exists to get you from one fabulous F/X sequence to the next, and the director is a great special effects supervisor who thinks he's also a screenwriter.<br /><br />Likewise you probably like science fiction...except when it's all fiction no science, which is usually the case.<br /><br />The last big budget scifi action movie I saw was Avatar. I enjoyed it enough to see it twice (partly to test two different 3D systems), but it hasn't left much of a residue in my mind/heart. Nothing wrong with film, but it lacked something. Perhaps it shows the difference between fine craftsmanship and true art. For me it lacked heart.<br /><br />On the other hand, I loved Serenity, whose director/screenwriter/auteur Joss Whedon knows how to direct an ensemble cast and make you care about their characters, tell a story that's actually a story, make the special effects work for the story and the characters instead of vice versa, and who understands that even the most serious drama needs a sprinkling of wit and a certain anarchic impulse to keep it from being too full of itself.<br /><br />So--was this true of Avengers, with the same director/screenwriter? Both movies have a lot of things in common, besides Joss Whedon. Each continues a franchise, with the challenge of lassoing in both franchise fans and new viewers. Each has a fairly large ensemble cast. Each pits flawed heroes against villains who aren't entirely cartoonish. Each has women who are actually interesting characters and not just eye candy (not that they aren't that too).<br /><br />My bottom line is that both films are worth non-fanboys seeing them. For me Serenity is more successful, but that doesn't mean Avengers isn't good too.<br /><br />Good enough so that my spouse, who generally prefers \\"art films\\" (as do I), now wants to see at least some of the preceding franchise movies--especially the Iron Mans. That's high praise. She'd liked Serenity, but agreed with me about Avatar, and found Hell Boy pretty much a waste of time.<br /><br />Some of the things we most liked about Avengers will be exactly the things some fanboys don't like, mind you. Character development means less action while that development is going on. Frequent, sly injections of humor mean the heroic, humorless posturing of so many action flicks is being diluted--good from my point of view, but the reason, I think, for some of the less favorable reviews here.<br /><br />For me the most memorable character was a secondary one: Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow. Unlike the four main characters and the main villain, her human strength isn't augmented, so though she's as martial artsy as the rest, her real \\"superpower\\" is a wily brilliance coupled with and coolly exploiting the kind of looks that hampers heterosexual men's ability to think coherently in her presence.<br /><br />I would love to see a prequel about her that develops her backstory, because, more than any other character, she's the one who's had a change of heart about whether to serve good or, well, not evil, but amoral self-interest. I'm not revealing anything here because this change takes place before Avengers' story begins.<br /><br />In this sense she's like Angel in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer franchise, or, earlier, Xena Warrior Princess. Like them, Johansson's character has to keep consciously choosing to do the right thing--it's not an automatic reflex like it is for Captain America, for example. And because of that, her goodness is...gooder...because it is a choice.<br /><br />Plus she is a spy, an assassin, a professional deceiver, using the exact tools she'd used before. So her goodness is the goodness of a battle-hardened warrior, not a saintly flower-strewing do-gooder.<br /><br />In one scene she has to do battle with someone she cares about, or at least cared about. That makes for a much more interesting battle than one between a White Hat and a Black Hat, where all you care about is the Good Guy winning.<br /><br />And actually, fine action sequences notwithstanding, my personal favorite scene in the movie is a conversation she has with a Bad Guy, in which there's no fighting at all. They just talk. But now, several days later, I'm still thinking about what she did in that scene--both Johansson and her character.<br /><br />The unique thing Johansson brings to an industry chock full o' beautiful women is her gravitas. She doesn't ask you to take her seriously. You have to. You can't not take her seriously, even though your hormones are yelling \\"Battle stations!\\"<br /><br />I don't think this is an act. She had this in Manny & Lo, when she was 12. She had this in The Horse Whisperer, when she was 14. She had this in Lost in Translation, when she was 17 yet playing a woman in her mid-twenties--convincingly. (Side note: Ryan Reynolds has got to be the biggest estupido in show biz. I bet their real problem was them both eventually realizing that she was considerably smarter than him, and his ego couldn't take it.)<br /><br />That said, the other major characters all have inner conflicts that get explored. This is the way in which the film is really three-dimensional. Though its use of 3D seems pretty good to me as well.<br /><br />Avengers isn't a profound art film like, say, Akira Kurosawa's Kagemusha--a truly great war movie we saw 30 years ago and that still sticks in our minds. But it's way better than most Hollywood blockbusters (such as Avatar) IF you want character and story and actual acting in your blockbusters and not just a White Hats Black Hats story that's mostly a parade of special effects sequences.<br /><br />I do think it's worth seeing in the theater, and in 3D. We have a 46\\" 1080p 120hz flatscreen TV and a Blu-Ray home theater (not 3D), but I'm still glad I saw this in the theater. It has the visual bigness that justifies the investment (even if you do buy the disk later), and though I haven't researched it thoroughly, I get the impression that home 3D isn't ready for prime time yet. So both the visual scale of the film and its 3D exploitation make it a good candidate for a theater visit, even if you see most films on your home system, as we do.<br /><br />The music score wasn't memorable either way--neither thrilling nor annoying. For me (and I'm a music buff) it was just there.<br /><br />Footnote: Gwynneth Paltrow only appears in a few scenes, which I regret because she's a luminous actor. She plays Robert Downey Jr.'s partner/lover, and as I recall she's always barefoot. It's kind of cool that she is--this one detail showing her character's insouciance despite her high-pressure job. But my spouse wondered if it was also because Paltrow is taller than Downey. Just sayin'...<br /><br />Lastly, for those whose love of science fiction is alloyed by some knowledge of science--you'll be best off if you regard this as a fantasy movie and not as a science fiction one, despite the abundant hardware. After all, two of the characters are deities from the ancient Norse religion. Another transforms periodically in a way that flagrantly violates the law of conservation of matter/energy.<br /><br />But even the hardware is, scientifically, nonsense. IronMan would need a fuel tank the size of a shuttle booster to do all that scooting around in the air, and since his very heavy exoshell has no flight surfaces, he'd always have to fly in stall mode at around a 45 degree angle at slower speeds in order to keep from plummeting out of the sky. The flying carrier is aerodynamically impossible. The G forces on IronMan would turn him into a red good inside his suit in short order.<br /><br />These aren't exactly criticisms of the film. Whedon once said, decades ago, that he strove to be emotionally true, but that he didn't sweat the technical details. And here he's filming a movie with at least half a dozen films and hundreds of comic books and graphic novels preceding it, locking him into much of the pseudotechnology you see here. So I'm just trying to manage your expectations. Serenity is a real science fiction movie, but it's not based on comic book superheroes and demigods. So don't leave the theater complaining about such stuff. You've been warned.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />1. If you're a Marvel franchise fanboy, see in theater, then buy disk. But do expect that it being directed by Joss Whedon makes it different from every other film in the franchise, especially in the injection of sly humor frequently. So be prepared for its Whedonization.<br /><br />Also, since it assembles everyone for the first time, it has to be a different kind of film from all the single-main-character predecessors. The fact that it's starting a new series of films featuring all these characters together means there has to be more than the usual amount of exposition in order to assemble the team.<br /><br />2. If you're an art house film lover (as in you instantly recognized my reference to Kurosawa and Kagemusha and perhaps wondered why I didn't reference Seven Samurai<br /><br />HOLD THE PRESSES! That's it. This is Seven Samurai redux. Assembling a team of mismatched misfits to fight a passel of baddies in defense of people all of whom did not appreciate their sacrifices. Seven Samurai is one of the greatest films of all time, but conceptualizing Avengers as a blockbuster homage to it (and I'm sure Whedon has seen it) is a good mindset to bring to this party.  )<br /><br />So to restart the point, if your an art house type, and you're with friends who want to see a spectacular big-budget action movie, this will suck way less for you than most of the alternatives. It's also a good family reunion PG-13 movie. I know much younger kids I'd take to it, and others the same age that I wouldn't. Depends more on the kid than the age. And if you're the \\"teachable moment\\" type of parent, this is a great film to take the kids to and then talk about the characters and actions afterwards. They might not even realize they're being, well, taught something.<br /><br />3. If you're a spouse who normally wants to watch things like Downton Abbey (which I'm watching now and loving BTW), married to someone who wants to see things blow up and gorgeous actresses doing the blowing-upping--for you the long-suffering spouse, Avengers has enough character/story stuff to serve your interests while hubby is enjoying the film's more kinetic aspects.<br /><br />It has lots of violence, but you're emotionally insulated from it, by the \\"live-action cartoon\\" quality of the film. This is nothing like Saving Private Ryan or Kill Bill I&II. It could be shown on primetime broadcast TV without editing, I believe. No sex, no revealing clothing even (Scarlett Johansson's catsuit is no more or less hoochie than what the Emma Peel character wore in the eponymous 1960s British TV series), almost no cussing, and no \\"hard cussing.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to mislead people into seeing films I like, or into not seeing films I don't like. I want to provide objective help for you, whatever your tastes are. So if you see Avengers and feel I misled you in any way, please add a comment to this review and I'll edit what I said in here to take account of your input.<br /><br />EDIT ADD--June 12, 2013<br /><br />My spouse & I just saw Star Trek Into Darkness. I wrote a full no-spoilers review of it under its own listing on Amazon. I just wanted to add here that seeing it reminded me strongly of how good a director Joss Whedon is--including big budget action movies. Whedon proved that a summer action film can still have original ideas, interesting characters, and something/someone to care about. J.J. Abrams' direction of Star Trek Into Darkness just proved how rare the Joss Whedons of the world are...in Hollywood at least. Avengers is twice the film STID is--and I'm saying that as someone who hadn't seen any of the Avengers prequel movies, while I had see pretty much everything in the Star Trek franchise both on TV and in the theater. Too bad we can't clone Whedon and just have him direct all such films...<br /><br />Particularly the action movie I'd most like to see: the one giving us Black Widow's backstory. Just to repeat that plea.e'd always have to fly in stall mode at around a 45 degree angle at slower speeds in order to keep from plummeting out of the sky. The flying carrier is aerodynamically impossible. The G forces on IronMan would turn him into a red good inside his suit in short order.<br /><br />These aren't exactly criticisms of the film. Whedon once said, decades ago, that he strove to be emotionally true, but that he didn't sweat the technical details. And here he's filming a movie with at least half a dozen films and hundreds of comic books and graphic novels preceding it, locking him into much of the pseudotechnology you see here. So I'm just trying to manage your expectations. Serenity is a real science fiction movie, but it's not based on comic book superheroes and demigods. So don't leave the theater complaining about such stuff. You've been warned.<br /><br />Bottom line:<br />1. If you're a Marvel franchise fanboy, see in theater, then buy disk. But do expect that it being directed by Joss Whedon makes it different from every other film in the franchise, especially in the injection of sly humor frequently. So be prepared for its Whedonization.<br /><br />Also, since it assembles everyone for the first time, it has to be a different kind of film from all the single-main-character predecessors. The fact that it's starting a new series of films featuring all these characters together means there has to be more than the usual amount of exposition in order to assemble the team.<br /><br />2. If you're an art house film lover (as in you instantly recognized my reference to Kurosawa and Kagemusha and perhaps wondered why I didn't reference Seven Samurai<br /><br />HOLD THE PRESSES! That's it. This is Seven Samurai redux. Assembling a team of mismatched misfits to fight a passel of baddies in defense of people all of whom did not appreciate their sacrifices. Seven Samurai is one of the greatest films of all time, but conceptualizing Avengers as a blockbuster homage to it (and I'm sure Whedon has seen it) is a good mindset to bring to this party.  )<br /><br />So to restart the point, if your an art house type, and you're with friends who want to see a spectacular big-budget action movie, this will suck way less for you than most of the alternatives. It's also a good family reunion PG-13 movie. I know much younger kids I'd take to it, and others the same age that I wouldn't. Depends more on the kid than the age. And if you're the \\"teachable moment\\" type of parent, this is a great film to take the kids to and then talk about the characters and actions afterwards. They might not even realize they're being, well, taught something.<br /><br />3. If you're a spouse who normally wants to watch things like Downton Abbey (which I'm watching now and loving BTW), married to someone who wants to see things blow up and gorgeous actresses doing the blowing-upping--for you the long-suffering spouse, Avengers has enough character/story stuff to serve your interests while hubby is enjoying the film's more kinetic aspects.<br /><br />It has lots of violence, but you're emotionally insulated from it, by the \\"live-action cartoon\\" quality of the film. This is nothing like Saving Private Ryan or Kill Bill I&II. It could be shown on primetime broadcast TV without editing, I believe. No sex, no revealing clothing even (Scarlett Johansson's catsuit is no more or less hoochie than what the Emma Peel character wore in the eponymous 1960s British TV series), almost no cussing, and no \\"hard cussing.\\"<br /><br />I don't want to mislead people into seeing films I like, or into not seeing films I don't like. I want to provide objective help for you, whatever your tastes are. So if you see Avengers and feel I misled you in any way, please add a comment to this review and I'll edit what I said in here to take account of your input.<br /><br />EDIT ADD--June 12, 2013<br /><br />My spouse & I just saw Star Trek Into Darkness.

B0015DROBO|4.0|I really liked this book. I saw all three of the original Swedish movies before reading this first book of the trilogy. The movies were outstanding and so is this book. Excellent strong character development and sense of place. Keen action that carries one along swiftly. I would have given it five stars except that the ending was, in my opinion, a cliche. It was the only moment in the entire book that lacked the originality of the characters. I am definitely reading the next two in order.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I started hearing alot about this book so I decided to read it too! I loved it. The only problem was that once you pick it up, you are hooked.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game ever for my little girl Trinity.this game is so awesome because it is just like Mario but with lepracon.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted, have spent way too much time playing it.  Looking forward to playing it more.  It is a great game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I know that this type of book isn't meant to be read for literary value, but I'm not kidding when I say my 7th grade students can write better. The author needs a dictionary to look up what the word \\"gape\\" means, and then needs a thesaurus so she can choose another word. Everyone is gaping and gasping and peeking up at each other and it's just all so pathetic. Also, Christan Grey is a world class controlling douche.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|can't put it down! plus you don't. have to spend in game money if you play well and don't. want to cheat.

0307730697|4.0|\\"Fearless is the story of a man of extremes, whose courage and determination was fueled by faith, family, and the love of a woman.\\" -excerpt from the cover of the book<br /><br />The above blurb is a very accurate description of this book. As it begins, we are introduced to Adam Brown and his family, and the journey begins. We follow Adam through high school, where it seemed he was ready to conquer the world, then spiral down with him as he makes the poor choices that lead to drug addiction. While the first part of the book was necessary to understand the man Adam became, I felt this was the weakest section. The more poor choices he continued to make, the more I wanted to give up on him. I began thinking about the two star ranking I would give the book, because I just was not involved.<br /><br />Boy, am I glad I stayed with this one. As Adam overcomes addiction and heads into the Navy Seals, everything picks up. I was fascinated with the ins and outs of his training, as well as the personal strength, both internal and external, it took to endure such hardships. As the journey deepened into the war effort, it became a book I couldn't put down. Adam was like the toy I had as a kid: it was a blow-up version of a punching bag, filled with air, and every time I hit it, it popped right back up. Nothing could keep this man down. Through every obstacle, I found myself cheering him on, and even though the book tells you how it will end, I will admit that I was wiping away tears.<br /><br />I was especially fascinated by the military world, both the training aspect as well as the combat missions. I found a new respect for what our men and women are facing in the battle against evil around the world. The lingo, for example \\"Is the juice worth the squeeze?\\", added to the wealth of information this book holds.<br /><br />There are a few negatives, especially for Christian readers. At times, the faith of some of the characters seemed more vaguely spiritual as opposed to a whole-hearted devotion to Christ. In keeping with the lingo of the military personnel involved, there is some off-colored language and stunts. The hardest one to read was the episode (spoiler alert!) where Adam put his private parts on an ant-hill. But it stayed true to the realistic nature of the book. I can not imagine trying to reconcile a strong faith in Jesus Christ with being a trained killer, but Adam pulls it off with considerable balance.<br /><br />In summary, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in military life. I loved the theme of never giving up, and that we all get second, third, and even seventh chances. It was a book that I feel would be an encouragement to anyone who is struggling with self-worth and feels they are too far gone to be of any value. And a side note: my husband has been harassing me for days to finish the book so he can read it. I even caught him reading the first few pages when he thought I wasn't looking! I would not, however, put this in our church library, where it would be accessible to children. All in all, after starting with two stars, it balanced out to a solid four stars. God bless his family and the other brave heros who have given their all for the sake of us at home.<br /><br />*I received a copy of this book for free from the publisher, but the opinion is mine and completely honest.hearted devotion to Christ.

B005L193RO|5.0|This is a good book. Its practical and research based.<br />It is a self-help book no doubt, but it written with a lot of down-to-earth<br />humour and is not as grandiose as some of those books sometimes<br />are. Very inspiring.
B002LCOQVY|5.0|If you´re looking for something else than listening to the music, this is the right choice. The vinyl comes with an image album which is awesome, with superb print quality.<br />The vinyl pressing is excellent, which makes you enjoy those sounds that were missing on the CD<br />5 Stars
B007VTVGAQ|4.0|This album is Fiona's true return to form. While I enjoyed her second and third albums, neither felt as polished as her first album. This entry into her canon, \\"The Idler Wheel...\\" is as good as Tidal. The lyrics, arrangements, and her voice are outstanding. \\"Periphery\\" is a song I can't get out of my head, particularly her use of what sounds like cloth tearing, it's like she's tearing with her words into our minds...such a great album and every Fiona Apple fan will be impressed by it, I believe. I hope this brings more fans to her music.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Huge Pumpkins fan. Let's talk about his post SP1 work for a moment.<br /><br />-Mary Star of the Sea-<br />Some very high moments, some very low moments.<br /><br />-The Future Embrace-<br />He left \\"Tilt\\" off the official album, the only exceptional song on the whole album.  Some very low moments but a very interesting creative work.  Doesn't make it fun to listen to, though.<br /><br />-Zeitgeist-<br />Same errors by leaving solid tracks like Ma Belle off of the record.  Exhausting to listen to.<br /><br />-The stand alone Teargarden singles-<br />Horrible production.  Very few high points.  Slaughtered OWATA - live horn version was very solid.<br /><br />-Oceania-<br />You won't find the high points from Gish, SD, MCIS, or even Adore.  It never gets THAT good.  But it never gets as bad or as embarrassing as the worst stuff off of any of the albums listed above  (sans Wildflower).  It's quite an enjoyable album to listen to, even if you're not in your living room jumping up and down shouting out the lyrics.  Not that I personally did that for most every SP1 song growing up...<br /><br />Different songs will remind the listener of different periods of the SP library.  However, never does it sound like a rip off.  More like a slight hint of inspiration here and there.<br /><br />*Quasar - Solid rocker and the heaviest song on the album.<br /><br />*Panopticon - Love this song.  Has a real shoegaze feel to it.<br /><br />*The Celestials - Starts slow but picks up and turns into a winner.<br /><br />*Violet Rays - I've read it in multiple places - this is \\"Old Man Bill's\\" version of In The Arms of Sleep.  It's not quite as haunting, but still a very solid tune.<br /><br />*My Love IS Winter - Sounds like Billy's \\"love song by the numbers single\\" formula he's relied on for a while.  Not a bad song by any means.  Better than \\"That's the way..\\" by a long shot.  Nice sound to the song.  It's catchy enough.<br /><br />*One Diamond, One Heart - I've read near universal panning for this song, but I really like it.  Synth heavy, but not like the rest of Teargarden.  Slower and pretty.<br /><br />*Pinwheels - Corgan at his best - folksy and backed by a great chorus.  Very pretty song.<br /><br />*Oceania - Most will say the live version was better.  A long \\"epic\\" production that SP is known for - heavy - soft - heavy.  I like this better on the album and actually like the cuts between the three mini songs.  The third stretch's solo is a little grating and is my least favorite part of the album.  Still really like most of the 9 minute song though.<br /><br />*Pale Horse - Fantastic.  Folksy again.  The little reverse drum effect towards the end is really cool.  Maybe the best lyrics of the entire album.<br /><br />*The Chimera - If Zwan and Rocket had a love child, you'd have The Chimera.  A little cheesy, but fun.<br /><br />*Glissandra - Another track I'm seeing panned that I LOVE.  Might be my favorite track on the album.  Has a haunting guitar hook.  Am I saying that right?  Likely not.<br /><br />*Inkless - Zwan again with a hint of.... I don't know.  Has a really catchy refrain and a good mellow sound.<br /><br />*Wildflower - Reminds me of \\"Pomp and Circumstances\\" from Z.  I'm not a big fan.  It doesn't really fit the rest of the album and he's forcing a vocal range that is on the verge of uncomfortable.<br /><br />So where does this rank for me in the body of work?  Here's how I rate the albums<br /><br />MCIS/Adore<br />SD (very close second)<br /><br />Machina 2<br />Gish (Shocker, but I only really liked Rhino off of Gish)<br />Machina<br /><br />Mary<br />Zeitgeist<br />The Future Embrace / Teargarden<br /><br />I would rank Oceania somewhere in my middle tier.  Maybe right above Machina, especially since you can listen to this album multiple times without being exhausted.
B003Y5H542|4.0|Great movie.  I bought it for my dad as part 1 of 3 Father's Day gifts.  He absolutely loves this movie and the soundtrack, by Los Lobos.  Just because it's animated, doesn't mean it's only for kids.  Most of the dialogue and schtick adult.  I wish it had special features other than just the commentary and story board.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|This book was very captivating mostly because of Strayed's good use of descriptive writing.  I was amazed at her journey, because it actually happened. But what I liked the most was that when she was hiking it felt like I was right alongside her.  I really enjoyed the book.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am thoroughly impressed with this cover.  It protects my Fire and it snapped on easily.  I like the fact that it is very like the iPad cover - it folds and will let my Fire stand up sideways so I can type if I choose.  It has a little groove so you can fold and make a stand.  The groove could be a tad bit deeper, but it works.  I kept hitting the on/off button on the Fire so turn it upside down so the button is on top and the cover works just fine that way too.  I am impressed with the quality of the product - I wasn't expecting it to be so well made.  I've had it for about 2 months and am very pleased with it.

B0067TGSOK|5.0|Some folks are satisfied with the 9-to-5 grind, working for someone else, content with leaving home in the morning and not coming home until the late afternoon. Others want more from their work lives - a flexible schedule, control over the product, creating something to take pride in. A few have been pushed out of Officeland and know that they don't really want to go back.<br /><br />&#34;The $100 Startup&#34; is a great map to start with. You will meet people with no greater education, qualifications, or charisma than you do - but each of them has started a profitable business that utilizes their talents and gets them up and running - gladly - every working day.<br /><br />As a growing solopreneur, I've found ideas in this book that I can use right away. Thank you, Chris, and thanks to all of the people profiled in the book, for showing that yes, indeed, you can.
0307341577|5.0|Twenty-four years ago Libby Day's family was wiped out in one blood-soaked night, and her brother Ben is sitting in jail, in large part due to Libby's testimony. Now the sympathy money she got from strangers is running out, and she enters into a business relationship with the odd members of a Kill Club: she will use her influence to interview people involved with the case and earn a few thousand dollars, even though she disagrees with them that Ben was wrongfully convicted. But as she talks to those who knew parts of the night's events, she begins to wonder if she was mistaken. Is the killer still out there? Why is Ben willing to sit in jail even as he maintains his innocence?<br /><br />As the mystery and its solution unfold, we move from chapter to chapter alternating between present-day Libby, and Ben and his mother on that horrific night, and the amazing story, while fascinating, still takes a backseat to the remarkable writing. Flynn, in this, her second book, captures the desperation of mother Patty and the dark panic of Ben as well as Libby's angry, depressed young woman with brilliant phrasing and superb dialogue. None of these characters are likable, but you can't put the book down.<br /><br />\\"Someone had bought the property years ago, razed the house immediately, crushing walls my mother had prettied with cheap flowery posters, smashing windows we'd breathed against while waiting to see who was coming down the drive, splintering the doorframe where my mom had penciled the growth of Ben and my sisters but been too tired to chart me ...\\"<br /><br />Wow. If you enjoy stylish psychological thrillers, you will love this book. I look forward to others by this author.
0767817710|5.0|An older movie, but great if you like Gene Hackman, Leonardo DeCapria, Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe and Gary Sinese.  Great actors and Western story.
B007R41E8O|4.0|I liked this game-- story line was good, good hints- if you got lost there was help-interesting what happened at the end of story. highly recommend it - enjoyed game without getting stressed.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Dance With Dragons is a good book and a worthy entry in the series.<br />First I would like to say that many will disagree with this but a lot has happened here. The thing is you must understand that much of it takes place in the same timeline as 'A Feast For Crows' and other than the last 250 pages or so does the story progress from that time. I understand why this would upset many people as they want the series to move forward as to what happens next however these events all have great relevance and for me made the previous 2 books that much better. I will not spoil the fun within but we learn of what some of the main characters have been doing or not doing since 'Storm' and feeds into what could happen next which is what a good series is about. I look forward to the next 2 with great anticipation as I am now without a good series read and will have to see if Robert Jordan is as good or bad as others have proclaimed.<br /><br />In short if you have been pleased by the first 3 books and left shaking your head at the 4th don't be discouraged by the bad reviews here get the book!

B0053JJLLC|1.0|This book is extraordinarily shallow.  The dialogue is superficial, the plot is linear, and the characters are flat.  The first chapter was quite promising and suspenseful, but the book deteriorated rapidly.  Don't bother with this.
B00881VLCE|5.0|its really fun and entertaining especially on a late night. it always keeps me busy and I have the urge to finish all the puzzles.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|Although I wouldn't call this the worst-written book ever, and I did read it to the end, this opus is best described as decidedly mediocre. The writing style itself is very impoverished, lacking any imagination, flair or originality; it's very utilitarian and straight-forward. It really reads like a movie script project written by a young teenager. The whole setting is very contrived, which would be fine if this were a device or vehicle for something more exciting, but alas, what you see is what you get here. The characters are extremely one-dimensional and uninteresting: lack of any emotional depth is the worst aspect of the writing. The only good part that I almost enjoyed (hence the two stars) is the main battle sequence, which was absorbing enough to bring me to the end of the book, but it isn't nearly enough to tempt me to read a single page of the 2nd book of the trilogy.<br /><br />I find the high rating of this book particularly depressing, especially considering that so few people still read nowadays on a regular basis. There is more substance, imagination and thought in a single paragraph of most sci-fi or fantasy novels (to say nothing about great works of literature) than in this entire novel. It is very sad that people would waste their time reading this, instead or something more mentally stimulating. ...I just browsed through a few pages of a kindle-only \\"self-published\\" work by an unknown author advertized on the amazon homepage, and those few pages have infinitely more emotional and intellectual depth than this entire book (raised my spirits, actually).
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|Ever watched tv while reading a book and maintaining conversation with a spouse? Yeah, me too. The novel, Canada, isn't that type of book, however. Author Richard Ford is attentive to detail and prone to introspection, almost to the point of exasperation. This book goes deep on many levels and you'll have to go there but it's worth the effort.<br /><br />Any great book is filled with memorable characters. Consider this description of the mother. \\"She had thick eyebrows and a shiny, thin skinned forehead under which her veins were visible...\\" Even minor players such as the unnamed jailer with an audible limp, stand out. I could also mention Indian Charley Quarters penchant for wearing lip-stick and make-up but the point is made. They are highly visible and well defined.<br /><br />This poignant tale of a fractured family and the survival of young Dell will not leave you anytime soon. I re-read passages and pondered the tale while not reading. Sounds kind of wonderful, doesn't it?
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the best books that I have read in a long time.  It is well written and the content of the story was great.  I would recommend it for all readers and especially young girls...
B00845PV16|3.0|This sequel opens cold with several different groups trying to gain or retain custody of a special child. Why is he special? I don't think I'm spoiling it for you to state that he's the devil's child. Watch for Anthony Stuart Head in a cameo as one of the monks guarding the child. One of the factions, represented by Idris Elba as a renegade priest, decides that the best way to track and protect the child is to bring the Ghost Rider in on the scene. He finds Johnny Blaze in a depression spiral, and disappointingly there is no explanation provided as to how he wound up separated from his compadres in the first movie. Moreau (Elba) convinces Johnny to find and protect the child, both for the child's sake and his own - he promises Johnny that he knows how to remove the curse of the Ghost Rider for good. The rest of the flick is a series of chase scenes, battle scenes, back stabbing and bonding interludes. Cage hams it up, clearly having some fun with the B movie tropes and some of the more overwrought dialogue. Elba is excellent and gets plenty of screen time, and Johnny Whitworth provides plenty of comic relief and not a little menace as the secondary antagonist. Ciaran Hinds is woefully underused as the main antagonist. I understand you don't want to pull out that big gun until you're darn good and ready, but he really needed more to do. Violante Placido and Fergus Riordan are fine as the mother and child at the center of the action. There are a lot of amusing visual touches that remind the viewer that this movie is based on a comic book, and there's a bit of a revelation as to exactly what the Ghost Rider really is. The story does not have nearly as much pathos as the first movie, but it's an entertaining time waster.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have read reviews about this book, and to be honest...  Reading some of them made this a Must read...  I have finished reading the FSoG series, started the Crossfire books and was skeptical about this one..  all I can say is I LOVED IT! I think deep down, we all want someone to have that kind of love for us.. Sure, the violence is less to be desired in a real relationship, but its a book and it was an added bonus for the story...  I have recommened it to all of my friends that were looking for something to read after they completed Fifty Shades...  I have added this to my Must \\"Re-Read\\" on my kindle...  LOVED it and wish there were more like it...  Great books should never just stop at one!

After having read tons of \\"moan\\" and \\"groan\\", I decided that a couple hours of my life have definitely been wasted.<br /><br />The book had a really romantic start, a college girl met an one of a kind billionaire. Even though Cinderella is a bit of old style story, I was expecting some really interesting twists. But what can I say to those \\"grin\\" \\"mirk\\" and \\"bite my lips\\"? Absolute nothing.
1451608659|5.0|This book offers a rare look into the Elite gymnastics scene as well as the life of one of it's most famous stars. Dominique held nothing bakc and wrote a very presonal, very honest recap of her career and trials. Well written and in cluded many personal photos of her and her family. Great book! couldnt put it down!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|50 shades was a joke. It felt like I was reading the diary of a 14 year old who over exaggerates.
0345803485|2.0|This book was clearly written by a 16-year-old virgin who stumbled across a S&M website and got a thesaurus for her birthday.  She needs to find a synonym for \\"down there\\".  Don't waste your time or money..it's Fifty Shades of Pathetic.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved this book! I was afraid that it would have a disappointing ending, but I was surprisingly pleased. Many books seem to end the trilogy story as if they got tired of writing. Suzanne Collins is not one of those authors. If you liked the first and second book in the series, you won't be disappointed.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Note: May contain spoilers. Proceed with caution.<br /><br />Safe House is one of the many films I missed when it went into theaters. I recently rented, and watched, the film and I must say I was pretty impressed. Safe House stars big names Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds. Everything I've seen with Reynolds in the past has had him as a fun, carefree, character. In Safe House Reynolds plays a man working for the CIA who has to guard a safe house in Africa. Throughout the film it's clear Matt Weston (Reynolds) is a very complex character. It seems as if he wants to enjoy his job, but isn't really satisfied with it. On top of that he has to lie to his girlfriend about working for the CIA. Overall I felt Reynolds did a phenomenal job, I hope to see him play more roles like this in the future.<br /><br />Then we have Denzel Washington playing ex-CIA agent Tobin Frost. I must say over the years I have become very fond of Denzel as an actor. He always plays this calm, cool, collective badass who is two steps ahead of everyone. He always portrays a very strong, controlling, character. Well if you're a fan of Denzel nothing here is new. His character has all these traits, and no matter what happened in the film it seemed like just another day for Mr. Frost.<br /><br />The story isn't terrible, and neither is the writing, but the strong point of this film is the acting. Not just from Denzel and Reynolds, but from the whole cast. I felt at times the story felt a little generic, and there were times where the camera was a little shaky or placed at a weird angle. These are things to be expected from an action flick, but you would think directors would learn from these little things. They can sometimes make the difference between a good movie and an excellent film.<br /><br />Lastly the score composed by Ramin Djawadi is phenomenal. Not only does is fit the tone perfectly for each scene, but at times it makes the scene more intense which, for me, makes it more enjoyable. I'mdefinitely going to check out the soundtrack, just to see if it's as good as it is in the film.<br /><br />Overall Score: 7.5/10 - Safe House does have it's flaws, but what film doesn't? What we are given is a strong action thriller with excellent acting from an amazing cast. I would definitely recommend watching this if you're given the opportunity.
B0083GOPSG|4.0|Great movie! Great build up, Great actoin, and a crazy ending. The HD version is good quality if you have the internet so make sure that you have good internet connection.
0099579936|1.0|Are you kidding me? This book was horrible! I don't even know where to begin. I realize this is fantasy, but the situations and characters in this book are so unbelievable until its hilarious. Seriously I pretty much couldn't stand Ana... I actually hated her more then Christian, which is saying something. The writing was so incredibly repetitive. ( foil packet, crap, jeez, eye rolling, mouth in a hard line wtf does that even mean?)Who goes from a virgin to a nympho (having multiple orgasms I might add...) in a matter of weeks! And that tampon scene was down right disgusting. Ana was pathetic and I'm 99% sure a man as accomplished as Christian would NEVER be interested in her. Speaking of Christian...it was just to much. Billionaire at 26! (yeah right) fluent French,, Greek god, pianist, well endowed, pilot....the list goes on in on. No one is that perfect... Sorry I'm not buying it. At least you understand why he had issues. However Christian didn't just need weekly therapy, he needed to be 302'd to deal with his issues. And it's not about the BDSM at all he was just completely nuts. The reviews of this book are MUCH more interesting than the story lol.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game it must be the best game i ever played and my friends have it too and love.
B0086700CM|5.0|I always wanted this game. it is sooooooo much tum I don't anyone could dislike this hale it should just get 5 stars
B0054W4JQK|3.0|Whilst the pretext of this novel may seem trite, this is  page turner in the true sense.  You know what will happen but are bound to find out anyway.  An insight into the real problems of people with serious brain damage albeit fictionalised
B006X8GFBQ|4.0|Alastair Reynolds is my current fave science fiction writer.  I love that he writes informed by real science and that those details, which can be boring when not handled well, only add to the story.  Others have summarized the plot and so I will not add anything in that regard. This book is different from Mr. Reynolds other novels in that it is more of a near future science fiction, though I feel that the next instalment may stretch beyond this.  The large ideas and vast expanses of time and space are reined in, but you can definitely feel their influence in the story line. I enjoyed this book thoroughly and look forward with anticipation to the next one.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love this game......but it takes up the battery and sometimes have glitches in it but its still fun to play
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have always lobed angry birds but with rio... awesome. you can actually use Rio in some of the levels. the backgrounds are also the fun and colorgul bachgrounds from Rio.

B0080CL0HM|5.0|Watched Bel Ami on VOD.  What a great<br />service VOD is.  Not having to wait for<br />the film to download.  Almost as good as<br />seeing it in a theater.<br />Loved the movie itself, I had to watch it<br />twice to get a better feel for the plot as<br />I had not read the book.  I thought the<br />acting was superb.  Christini Ricci and<br />Robert Pattinson were very believable in their<br />roles.
B0087OXDDC|5.0|When I started to learn English at High School I thougth how people could remember the meaning of the phrasal verbs, Thay had not sense!!<br />With this way to learn phrasal verbs, each verb you learn you will remenber because the explanation is very funny and you remenber the funny things.
B00352QISI|5.0|This is one of those movies that grips you from the beginning and leaves you guessing till the end.  Realistic technology (Placed in future) and effects.  The Portions of the ship the characters travel through are awesome.  One of the best new story lines I have seen in awhile.

0071762345|5.0|The introduction of social media tools has made transparency in marketing not only important, but critical. Social media enhances the ability to listen to what customers and prospects are saying publicly for any size company and brand in almost any industry today.  I would argue that listening to customers has always been one of the key tenets of good marketing, and I agree with Dave Kerpen's precept that that it has never been cheaper or easier to do so because of social media. There is no longer any excuse for companies to be ignorant of what is going on with both their customers and, I would add, their competitors.    Highly readable, this book is just the right mix of case studies, guidelines and suggestions. I read the book in one beach sitting. It is broken into digestible chapters of 12-15 pages in length, and the style is conversational yet substantial, with suggested \\"Action Items\\" at the end of each chapter. (I do always wonder if readers actually stop to write down their answers to these exercises. I just wanted to keep reading the book!)    Start By Listening    Kerpen starts with the fundamentals of any good marketing plan: Listen First, Define Your Target Audience, and Think Like Your Consumer. His anecdote of buying a highly targeted Facebook ad to send his wife a message while he was away on a business trip is both personal and compelling, and counteracts the seeming overwhelming enormity and anonymity of a huge social network like Facebook. From there, we move on to the Dialog phase, where Kerpen covers everything from how to create a dialog to how to respond to customer comments - all of them, good and bad. He highlights an important phenomenon of the \\"crowd sourced customer service\\" method: customers will often answer questions, and even defend a brand against negative comments and complaints. If companies can get over the idea of controlling customer conversations on social media, this idea is a powerful one.    (Read my complete review at[...] )
B000000XB9|5.0|This is one of the best albums ever made. I grew up listening to this on eight-track tape in my best friends car while we cruised  for girls back in the 70's. Every song is good, not like most albums, even greatest hits albums, that only have a few good songs. And this is loaded with 20 songs. I had the album, the eight-track tape, then the cassette tape, and now, finally, the cd. I loved it, my kids loved it, and now my grandkids love it. Just about any music lover will love this music.
B004K8WJ3Y|3.0|The new offering from Whitesnake continues in the tradition that this band has tread for over 20 years now.  Loud, bombastic, heavy, cock rock, that is not meant as an intellectual enterprise, but rather to simply rock your balls off.  Instrumentally the current version of Whitesnake is as good as any lineup main man David Coverdale has ever put together.  The addition of drummer Brian Tichey adds a significant thump to the bottom end and the rest of the band is at the top of their game.  Vocally Coverdale does not have the pipes that he once did, but his slightly more raspy vocal style actually enhances some of the more bluesy material.  Considering his advanced age he can still belt it out quite well.  Lyrically is where the album falls down for me a bit.  Coverdale uses every rock cliché in the book and then some.  I mean even the song titles are cliché's (\\"Steal Your Heart Away\\", \\"Dogs In The Street\\", \\"My Evil Ways\\", \\"Love Will Set You Free\\").  So, I guess the bottom line for me is the music is great, but the songwriting is a bit underwhelming.  Overall I would probably go 3.5 stars for this one.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I absolutely loved the Forgotten Garden.  The unique way the mystery unfolds, skipping between the early 1900's, to 1975, to 2005, made it almost impossible to put down.  The writing was exquisite and evoked such feelings about the characters, that by the end of the book, I felt like I knew most of them intimately.  Though the beautiful language made me want to savor every word, the mystery made me want to read quickly to discover more.  A fascinating story and a wonderful read!!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I have been an avid follower of Supernatural since season one. As such, I have seen the show's two main characters, Sam and Dean Winchester, face creatures ranging from demons to witches, from vampires to werewolves, from wraiths to tricksters, from roogaroos to angels, and SO much more. Needless to say, you would think with a show like this, especially one where the writers will only pull from legends that already exist, things would get old quickly. However, Supernatural has been running for seven seasons now, and each one has presented something new and exciting for viewers. This particular season presented a whole new breed of monster: the leviathon. And these monsters brought with them an entirely different set of rules.<br /><br />I must admit that while there were a lot of things to love about this season, including the new monsters, the classic monster-of-the-week episodes a la seasons 1 & 2, the brotherly bonding moments between Sam and Dean, and the classic Supernatural humor that fans have come to know and love, there were also a few things to dislike about this season. The main two things that I had issues with this season were the loss of beloved characters and the fact that the leviathons' constant hunt for the boys drive them to ditch the Impala for the vast majority of the season.<br /><br />Still, in spite of these two drawbacks, the show still managed to pull off another great season. And like they have always managed to do, they ended the season with a cliffhanger that leaves you wanting more. And I'm personally hoping that the \\"more\\" I get with season 8 rectifies my few issues with season 7 by bringing back our lost characters and reinstating the Impala to its rightful role: an appearance in EVERY episode!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book!  You never know what is coming next.  I would definately reccomend this read.  Well worth your time and money.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is hard to get mad at and I get easily mad at games but this is so addicting its crazy!
B008469DGY|5.0|I just cant explain how much fun this game is and its great for killing time. Really should get the game if you don't have it already
B005K17RU0|4.0|Good app especially when on the road and you need to know what the weather is going to be like.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Being able to stream music and movies is awesome. Add support for full screen games and the ability to make custom on screen keyboard buttons and I would be extremely happy.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cute.. and fun to play while winding down for the night with the kids :) I like it as much as they do :)
0345529057|4.0|The product I purchased was used as described. The only gripes I had was how long the shipping took. Besides that there's nothing I can't really complain about based on how cheap I got them for.
B003UESJ9M|4.0|I really liked this movie, despite what the previous reviews said.  It was slow in a couple of scenes but overall, enjoyable enough to add to my movie collection.  Gwyneth has a great voice and I'm surprised she hasn't made a career of it.  Garrett Hedlund has a sensual deep voice that he should look into making a career of it, as well.  Just an overall good movie, however upsetting the ending was.
0345803507|2.0|I had to read the 3rd installment even though I didnt like book 2 as much as book 1. I have no one to blame but myself. As the story progresses, Ana becomes so annoying that I want things to turn out badly for her. Ana... Beautiful, smart, billionaire husband, and yet, she is restless and irritable and in need of girl talk,  Who wouldn't be? Running your own company can be tiring.  Her best friend, also with super model good looks and tons of money, at least she isn't as much of a complainer.  The problem is, if it wasn't for Ana's immaturity and disregard for her own safety, there wouldn't be much of a story at all. I actually find myself  cringing at the  things this character says and does.  She often refers to herself as being \\"shy\\" with her husband, or that she is smiling \\"shyly\\"... And 5 seconds later she is verbally assaulting someone for daring to look a her husband. She thinks the phrase, \\"oh my\\" so many times that I feel like gagging.<br />I realize Ana is supposed to be young but she isn't 15 like she acts. I thinks she has more mental problems than Christian does,  I hope this is the end of their story. Ana is insufferable and the writing is horrific. Just how many times can one person flush or blush in one day?
B0086QS7N2|5.0|I love their concept albums from the '70s so getting another one now is a pleasant surprise. It's typical Rush courage to do whatever the bleep they want. Love it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well written, beautiful love story about 2 totally different people from opposite sides of the track that find unconditional love in each other.
B007549W62|2.0|I admit it.  I don't like ugly movies.  Call me frivolous, accuse me of having as much depth as a puddle, I don't care.  When I watch a movie, it's not to have a mirror held up to human nature and see what dark, devious depths are reflected within.  I watch a movie to be entertained, to be taken away from the ills of the world.  The Divide is an UGLY movie; I felt the same way after watching it as I did after watching [[ASIN:B004SUDQ2M Blindness]]:  disturbed, violated, depressed, haunted.  In fact, if you want a really fun movie night, watch the two movies back-to-back.  If you don't want to vomit and curl up in a fetal ball on bathroom floor afterwards, you're a much stronger person than I.<br /><br />At the technical/artistic level, I can admire The Divide.  The story is strong (for the most part), compellingly told with bravura performances by all the actors; the setting is claustrophobic, with a disgustingly realistic art and prop design.  Other than a certain whoopsie in the plot, which introduced a rather nonsensical and never fully explained story element, we're moved along without a hitch as the film explores what it takes for humans to devolve into monsters.  The movie starts off with some sort of nuclear attack on some American city; we're never told who is behind the attack, though the characters have their own particular theories.  We watch as the tenants of an apartment building race downstairs to find shelter; only a few manage to push past the building manager guarding the door of an underground bunker before he locks the door in place.  And so the story begins.  How long will the food last?  What about the water?  How long before all the ingrained cultural behaviors, such as kindness, charity, consideration, break down and our inner animal behaviors, such as greed, envy, destruction, come out in force?  In the end, as the characters try to break free from what ultimately becomes a prison, the question becomes, Was surviving the nuclear blast a salvation?<br /><br />For the most part the movie flows as we watch these nine people spiral downwards, losing the veneer civilization places upon them and becoming more base until, at the end, most aren't even recognizable as human beings.  We see the paranoia take hold, the despair grow, the utter resignation to their fate invade their bodies like cancer.  However, the movie takes an odd turn early on, introducing a \\"What the heck was that about?\\" plot point:  ***POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD*** A group of hazmat-attired men with guns and weird helmet-masks break into the bunker, examine and then abduct one of the characters, a little girl named Wendi, the daughter of Rosanna Arquette's character, Marilyn, and then try to kill the remaining characters.  The characters overcome the intruders, killing a couple of them, before once more locking themselves into the bunker.  Later, Josh, played by Milo Ventimiglia, puts on one of the hazmat suits and ventures out to find out what's going on.  What he finds is an airlock tube attached to the outside of the bunker's door and a lab staffed by more mystery hazmat-suited men... and Wendi, along with other children, shaved and with tubes sticking out of their mouths, comatose in isolation capsules.  Josh gets discovered and barely makes it back to the bunker alive, but instead of coming back in and wiping Josh and the others out, the mystery men weld the bunker door shut.  So now the survivors are well and truly trapped, and this is where the depravity begins.  We're never told who those mystery men are, what agency or even country they work for, or what the hell they were doing.  To me it seemed as though they only existed for their hazmat suits, which played a part in the movie's finale.  Otherwise, they served no reasonable purpose.  Also, the character played by Lauren German, Eva, must've had a secret cache of shampoo and soap, not to mention extra water:  As the other characters degenerate and deteriorate, growing pale and wan, developing dark circles underneath their eyes; as their greasy hair falls out from malnutrition and their gums bleed, as their skin and clothing become foul with dirt, grease, and bodily fluids, Eva remains relatively unscathed.  Her hair stays clean looking, her skin remains glowing; even her clothing stays decent.  It's only until near the very end that she shows signs of deprivation.  Frankly, if anyone should've inspired paranoia of food hoarding, it should've been Eva.<br /><br />While I can admire the film, that doesn't mean I like it, and I don't.  Certainly, scenes from the movie haunt me; even now, as I write this, I can see bits of it playing out in my head.  And I hate that, because I don't want to carry that ugliness with me.  As I said before, I want to movies to uplift me, to delight me, to take me away from reality for a couple of hours so I can smile, laugh, and be ignorant of the world around me.  A world, I might add, which holds enough ugliness in it without needing any fictional window dressing.  I don't know what kind of person I'd become should I be involved in some sort of survival-of-the-fittest situation, but I know how others would change:  Some would become even greater than before, some would remain the same, while most would happily embrace the monster within as they gleefully gave in to their worst impulses.  I already know this.

B001NLKT60|4.0|Wraps up the first book and starts another story but it is too short.  Great books though.  You barely get into the story and it ends so that you have to read the third book in the trilogy to put it all together.  The third book is well worth it so don't be afraid to get this one and spring board into the third.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Very informative and boosting.  Every person on earth needs to know their strenghts and try to improve it and not to focus so much on your weaknesses.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Very well written. Well worth the money to buy this book from Amazon after the disappointment of the too short second book.  The second book was a tease but you have to read it before this one.  This third book in the trilogy wraps all the loose ends up.  Makes me want to go to Sweden to see where all the streets and locations are that are mentioned in the book because the reader has no idea where they are unless they live in Sweden and/or maybe specifically in Stockholm.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game so addictive. I had to get the hang of it cause I was stressing out at first lol. I got it now and I love it.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Wonderful story about a modern day  young lady transported back into the lives of the Bennett family. Can you imagine meeting Mr Darcy and not punching out his lights? Charming movie for a rainy day.  I've watched it many times. it is one of my favorites. Maybe I'll watch it again tonight.  I highly recommend it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|wonderful app! hours of entertainment and very calming. the puzzles are lovely and the Beatles pack is my favorite. definitely worth the price.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I thought this book was enjoyable, but it wasn't as great as everyone told me it was going to be. Honestly, there was too much sex. If all you want to read about is sex, then go read pure erotica or watch porn. The story is cute and intriguing, but very unrealistic. Without all the sex scenes, the book really wouldn't have much at all. I thought the characterization of Anastasia was undeveloped and a tad confusing. One second she's this independent, strong-willed girl and then next minute she's acting like a insecure little wallflower. It's a good pool-side/beach read, but definitely not amazing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is fun and gets really addictive! you have to win each game, no matter how frustrating it gets. Love it
B006ON41FC|2.0|This app used to cost a small one time fee and could be fully enjoyed, with no additional costs.  The latest update features in app purchasing.  This change takes away from the thought of being able to use everthing available at no added cost.  Uninstalled.  The game Devs that want to go overboard with fees will see none of my business.
B005CFVSYK|5.0|I just love the crocs with the translucent straps. They have a dressier look than the other ones that I have. These shoes can be worn with just about anything and they are very comfortable. Great Purchase!<br />I just had to write back because I just received the aqua and ultraviolet pair. The color is absolutely beautiful, very denim friendly. I am now tempted to go for the other 2 colors. Do not hesitate!
B0086700CM|3.0|I love the game but it always freezes up in the middle of one of my runs! The game's awesome though! It is never the same course twice in a row...there is always some sort of challenge!
B001IF277K|5.0|I was having a problem with my phone and at first I thought it was a certain rom that I downloaded. It wasn't charging correctly and giving me false battery %. I did have the phone for a couple of years, so then I read that it might be time to change the battery. Once I did that everything was working as it did when i first purchased the phone and with the same rom.
B0031RS44S|5.0|As to be expected in this series about ex-military cop, Jack Reacher, there is always excitement and plenty of twists and turns to the plot.  I love how the character, Reacher, as awesome as he is, can always admit to his mistakes and humbly takes responsibility when he is wrong - a very human trait for a hero!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Addicitng. Very Fun. I love it. My sister loves it. My cousins love it too. Perfect for everyone! Recommend it to anyone and everyone! 5 stars for sure!

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|The wait is over and, as usual, Fiona Apple does NOT disappoint. This album, although noticeably different than her other 3, has one thing in common with the rest of her discography--the music is outstanding! And lyrically, she's still the cerebral songstress we know & love (as all the greats are: Tori Amos, Alanis Morissette, & Kate Bush). It's always difficult to name favorites because I usually end up naming every track on the album by the end of the sentence, but this time I'll digress & only name half the songs...Every Single Night, Daredevil, Valentine, Anything We Want, & Hot Knife. I want to share the core lyrics to the last song named so that you can see how uniquely different these songs are compared to past gems like Shadowboxer, The Way Things Are, & Parting Gift (to name only 3 : (<br /><br />\\"If I'm butter, if I'm butter, if I'm butter then he's a hot knife. He makes my heart a cinemascope screen, showing a dancing bird of paradise.<br /><br />I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife, I'm a hot knife he's a pad of butter. If I get a chance I'm going to show him that he's never gonna need another, never need another...\\"<br /><br />You hear these separate paragraphs alone at least once, but the two overlap each other for the most part of the entire song. And if you're skeptical, don't be because I promise it's extremely catchy!
B000063Y8F|5.0|I used to get the five dollar grocery store model every few years, after the previous cheap press would snap off at the head.  No more - this one works great and seems almost impossible to break.  Solidy built to last a lifetime.  Once you get this item, you will start to seek out other Rosle products, as the value is excellent when you consider their high quality.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Heard all the hype and thought I'd dive into this trilogy. Well, so much for that thought. Made it through the first book....finally. It took me a month. (Considering I read the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a week, a month for just the first book of this is saying something all by itself.)<br /><br />Ana has all the maturity of the average middle schooler. Christian has a tad bit more. Maybe that of a high school sophomore. Case in point; Ana does hours of Google research on Christian's fetish and is completely done in by six lashes with a belt at the end of this book. Seriously? After reading about fisting, six lashes send her running for the hills?<br /><br />Oh, and beware the \\"inner goddess\\" who is even more immature than Ana's outer self. Every time the inner goddess was mentioned (which was constantly) I kept picturing the Power Puff Girls.<br /><br />As far as this being erotica....it's not. A few vague scenes are thrown in, but they're tepid at best. Definitely not \\"steamy.\\" If B&D/S&M erotica is your thing, try \\"Nine and a Half Weeks.\\"<br /><br />Needless to say, I won't be reading the other two books in this trilogy.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|I did not receive this book on my kindle.  Didn't I cancel this order in time to not be charged for it?  Please let me know!  Thanks.Oh, I HAD  to rate this item before I could complete the action.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of my favorite TV series was Stargate SG-1, so I admit I was a bit reluctant to try another science fiction series. However, upon recommendation by a friend, I decided, what the heck. I purchased the complete series on Blu-ray.<br /><br />It started a bit slowly, and was completely unlike any other Sci-Fi adventure I had previously enjoyed. (Incidentally, I have been a fan of this genre for probably 45 years or more.) After the first couple of episodes, I was absolutely hooked and could hardly stop watching. As many other reviewers have said, I did not even know about Firefly until several years after its demise, but I totally agree that Fox made a terrible decision to pull the plug well before it should have.<br /><br />This series is a MUST WATCH for any serious fan of science fiction. I just wish it would play on my Blu-ray equipped laptop, but WinDVD complains that it is only playable on a Region A or B drive, else I would be watching it at this moment over 500 miles from home. Arggh! Not to worry; I can wait till I get home.
B005J32Y6Q|5.0|Lord of the Dance is my favorite performance Blu Ray.  I think using 3D help keep \\"fancy camerawork\\" that most people complain about down to a minimum. You really get to see the whole performance not just close up cut aways.  The 3d really brings out patterns of the dancing possibly more than seeing it live.  And at $14 it is a steel for both performance Blu Ray or 3d Blu Ray.  And you get both.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Act of Valor is a great military/action movie.  It's the closest look at the Seals you'll get on the big screen and it manages to deliver a detailed look at the guys who do what they do and ask for no recognition in return.  Some reviewers have complained about the fictional storyline, but it is basically a composite story of actual missions that the Seals have undertaken.  I have no problem with that - the story is still coherent, gripping, and very much within the realm of reality.  It's certainly more realistic than \\"Navy Seals\\" or \\"The Expendables\\" or many other Hollywood action offerings.<br /><br />The bluray has some bonus features that detail why the guys who made the movie made the decision to use real Seals instead of actors.  Their point is that the movie would have suffered it's authenticity and edge if actors portrayed the Seals.  The Seals that are in the movie are amazing guys - smart, extremely well trained, and in excellent physical condition.  After watching the opening action mission in this movie, you'll see why these guys did what no actor could have done.  Couple their performance with the fact that they were in a live fire environment and it's doubly amazing.  Is some of the dialogue a little stuff?  It can be in the movie's two or three slow scenes, but I wouldn't rate the acting any worse than a lot of the action fare that's out today. I feel that what little is lost in the \\"acting\\" is easily regained as soon as the Seals go do what they do (which is the majority of the movie).<br /><br />I read about the quality of the Bluray transfer before I bought this and was expecting a few minor issues, but they largely turned out to be nothing.  There is a night scene where some camera vibration is noticeable, but other than that, it is a great looking Bluray.  The sound is absolutely excellent, one of the best mixes I've heard.  There are a decent number of extras including a few short deleted scenes, background on the filming and the live fire environment, music video etc.  The best extra however, are the interviews the the Seals that they used in the movie.  It's interesting to hear about why they do what they do and why the chose to be in the movie (all said no at first.)<br /><br />Unfortunately I think there are some reviews that are overly critical because this movie portrays the military in a positive light.  That's too bad, because it is an excellent action film and the real life situations (instead of CGI everything) take this movie to a level that a lot of action films can't reach.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The game is great. it is logical. I play everyday. the first version had a bug. it is now working great
B006RUJST6|5.0|This story was wonderful. At first I was afraid the story was going to be juvenile with the subject character being a high school student. However I was pleasantly surprised how well the author kept is appropriately mature. You can't help fall in love with all the characters.<br /><br />This story deserves to be brought to life on film. It is special and sweet and so enjoyable. I could not put it down.  Well done.
0071762345|5.0|I am looking forward to using what I learned from this book. Selling has always been most successful when the salesperson asks questions. Finally, Dave Kerpenapplies it to internet marketing. A great leap forward!
B00783NWB6|2.0|Kinda of disappointing ....seem to be lacking a carry-over story from the previous  movie....3D was not so great either....Overall the movie was disappointing , and not as good as I thought it should be....Everyone is different , so where we didn't care for it, .<br />I'm sure other people loved it....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book by chance just over an year and really enjoyed it. Who likes books in series misses a reading like this. You can not stop reading one minute, and the characters are very engaging.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't make a habit of reviewing books or typing up a summary of my lengthy opinion, but I also don't come across a book like this one often. It's special in its own way, and I believe that anyone who gave it a fair chance will agree with that wholeheartedly.<br /><br />I am the first to admit to those that I suggest the book to: \\"This is not a classic novel. The writing isn't 'the best ever'. You'll feel repetitive, the adjectives are out of this world and you may or may not need a dictionary. Don't let that hinder your opinion. ENJOY IT FOR WHAT IT IS.\\"<br /><br />However, while being entitled to your opinion (of course), if you can't stomach the writing, push it aside and move on to the next. I admire someone who can put such intensity on paper and have it translate so well to such a huge audience.<br /><br />I truly believe that a good book is one that can evoke emotion in the reader. This story WILL make you feel something. Every woman - teenage fantasy or better - has at one time in their lives been Anastasia and been afraid of loving someone like Christian. Any story can be tweaked and told how we want to tell them, that is what is so great about fiction. Have so many forgotten that? It's a world that we can imagine living in, and I feel that the characters are written flawlessly. Christian - the strong alpha male - and Anastasia - the woman. She's a girl growing up and proving she has a voice. A story written with a lead female other age wouldn't have quite clicked so well. There are essences of fear and danger along with a whole lot of desire.<br /><br />Read the reviews, but don't listen to one person's opinion - not even mine. I read a lot of negative and it may have kept me from reading for a few months at most, but my curiosity finally got to me and I'm more than happy it did. My only advice is: definitely do not pick up this book if you can't be open minded and escape into a different world for a few hours, few days, few weeks - whatever your speed may be. Feel the stories and read with zero distraction or you won't get out of it what you should.<br /><br />And that's my two cents.<br /><br />P.S. I cannot express how much I appreciate the musical sense of this series. The author did a great job of making us feel this story even more with the mention of just a couple handfuls of songs. If you want to enjoy the books THAT much more, make a playlist. I feel she inserts elements of song intentionally, so take advantage of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I saw the movie before i read the book and I have to say the book blew me away. It really gave insight into Katniss' inner working and thought process. It made the book an amazing read that was hard to put down. If you are looking for a page turner this is it!
B007SGM084|5.0|could not put the trilogy down.  read all 3 books in as many days.  would wake up in the middle of the night to read another chapter....love love love books that hold your attention like this one did
0345803485|5.0|i bought all 3 books and read them in 3 days. i am quite sad Mr. Grey is out of my life for awhile while i lent them to my mom to read. i do plan to re-read the books once i get them back. i agree they arent the best written but i loved them anyways, i couldnt put them down. i would love a whole book of Christians pov (not just copy and pasted together stuff on the internet)

0062064304|4.0|I got this book from my girlfriend as a Birthday gift. We are both filmfreaks and were both more than delighted with the quality of the book itself, the pictures and with all the extra info we got from this awesome movie's production. However, I'm giving this 4 stars because I was supposed to get a birthday message with the book which didn't arrive, and it was really poorly packed: They simply stuck the book in a box with some sort of plastic air-filled bags which prevented the book from going up and down in the box, but not from hitting the sides. Result: All edges got considerably damaged so that now the book doesn't really look brand new.<br /><br />However, I loved the book and the fact that it's a thoughtful gift from my lovely girlfriend.

I can't be sure that the things Krugman says are actually true, nobody can.

B004Y1USJE|3.0|From the opening Overture you realize you are back in a familiar place (Early 80's progressive pop). The tone of the voice & the enunciation/phrasing of the lead vocals are very similar to Drama era Yes. The classic Yes background vocals go down smooth & easy. Lyrically speaking there ain't much substance, but it serves the music well enough. Drama in 1980 was my first introduction to Yes at 12 yrs old. A little later I discovered the \\"real\\" Yes when I came across my Father's Close to the Edge LP, wow! Holding in my hands the 12 inch green gatefold jacket with the dreamy Green spacescape artwork felt substantial & satisfying. Not to mention the truly spectacular music....Of course shortly thereafter came 90125 & another completely different version of Yes albeit without Steve Howe. But really the only true comparison for Fly From Here is Drama. This new album is good though nowhere near as memorable as Drama. What is missing is the sheets of almost metallic bright sounding guitars that Howe played throughout Drama. He played with a rocking purpose on Drama and then toned it down a notch or two for the Asia albums. I still think that Tempus Fugit was every bit as good as Rush's Spirit of Radio from the same era. The Drama era Yes had a fire to them that I wish could have progressed further into another LP.  Fly From Here is more similar to Asia era Steve Howe (though the inclusion of the acoustic Solitaire is a welcome, breezy guitar highlight). Also there are simply not enough memorable riffs or vocal refrains throughout this record. So I am still happy I bought it but it definitely ranks as a 3 star with Drama being 4 stars & the Yes Album, Fragile & Close to the Edge in the perfect 5 star category.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a fun game that anyone can have fun with. It is definately worth the dollar you spend on it.
0811876373|5.0|This book is just as it appears from the sneak peaks. It has great ideas for decorating cake pops and cake balls. I would recommend this book to anyone who really likes making cake balls and knows that they will have occasions to make special decorated cake pops for. If you have never made cake balls before, I would suggest baking a batch before purchasing this book because they do take a lot of work. I find it to be worth the effort because they taste and look amazing, and that is why I bought this book.

B0075MFS9Y|5.0|One of the best New Groups out there.  Everyone I have played it for becomes hooked.  Even the Security guard at my job heard it blasting from my car and asked, \\"Who is that your playing\\".  My Niece texted me that she heard them on two commercials, Blue Moon and Bing. I came across them watching the last five minutes of an episode of Heart of Dixie. CD arrived promptly in perfect condition. Heard they are playing in Central park in August.  Would love to see them live.
B0086700CM|5.0|Addictive and fun this game can be played non stop and still be fun.  you need this game. the only bad thing is I think the 25000 characters aren't that good.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This game, Azada, is fun! the puzzles are more interesting compared to other similar games. I recommend it for those who love simple brain teasers!
B00846TTDG|5.0|First- Thanks to the men and women who serve our country. Operators in special operations from all branches are heroes!<br /><br />Second- This movie is great. The movement in action scenes and muscle memory is incredible to watch as a viewer. We get a glimpse of team tactics, technology in use today, and great shoot outs!<br />I heard critics bashing this movie when it was released because the SEALs weren't actors. I say if you want A-list actors in an action movie- go see the Bourne movies. What these guys lacked in acting experience they made up with heart.<br /><br />Act of Valor was a novel idea for a movie and I was thrilled to see it. Great job!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|really?  This is what all the hysteria is about?  What an awful piece of garbage this book is.  If you really want to be entertained, just read thru all the reviews of this book.  Or better yet, publish all the negative reviews (there can't possibly be any positive reviews of this idiotic drivel...) into a book in itself.  Now that would be an entertaining read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I download this book on my kindle to see what all the fuss was about...wow! I couldn't put it down! This isn't even my genre but it was a great story!

1451608659|5.0|Wow is how I must start. Wow. Amazing.<br />This book will take you through every emotion. Ups and Downs, Excitement and Sadness... and more. I am so proud of Dominique for growing into such a respectable adult with all the things she went through. I laughed. I cried. I got goosebumps many times. And I absolutely see gymnastics in a little bit of a different light than before.<br />Wow.

B005FMGRRS|2.0|The G13 gamepad is awesome for use with Star Wars: The Old Republic (MMO). I love having a thumb stick for movement, and all my hotkey accessible on one hand. However, there was a specific driver I had to locate to make it compatible with the game, and the thumb stick is not analog, it is programmable to use the W,A,S,D keys, meaning movement isn't as smooth as expected. Also, and this is the worst part, after about three months of heavy gaming, the thumb stick began to exhibit some drifting, and there is no built in software to calibrate the thumb stick, or it's recognized dead zones, which is what you normally use to counter drift as a thumb stick displays signs of wear. Today, drift is so bad, I really can't even use it anymore. It just sits on a shelf with other outdated, or malfunctioning peripherals that I have used in the past. Great product, but has some major issues for hardcore gaming.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I am an admitted die hard Rush fan going back to the first time I saw them live in 1976.  And as a die hard Rush fan, I tend to be especially hard on judging any new material they conjure up.  Clockwork Angels was no exception and the first time I heard it I thought 'what?'.  I've listened to the whole thing 10 times now and I think it is their best album since 2112.  Since for me, 2112 defines Rush so nothing they ever do will take its place.  But Clockwork Angels is a masterpiece.  Every song has a riff that will stay in my head for hours.  Peart's percussion is on fire.  This is hard rock at its finest.  After 44 years together they are still at the top of their game.  I can't wait to see the concert!
1583334386|4.0|The book starts off terrific. After the first 2 chapters, I felt I was about to read one of the greatest and life-altering books I have ever read (and I read a LOT). The rest of the book, unfortunately, are not nearly as good or useful.<br /><br />The author is a PhD in Psychology and teaches at Stanford (she received her PhD from Stanford as well). As an academic, she doesn't venture far from the empirical psychology but provides plenty of insinuations on how we can improve our willpower. As I was reading this book, I must have seen at least a dozen PhD dissertation worthy topics being explored but not quite made concrete mainly due to lack of empirical evidence.<br /><br />The book, however, does provide two concrete and empirical based suggestions on how we can often substantially improve our willpower: regular exercise and meditation. I felt these two suggestions alone were worth the price of the book.<br /><br />After reading this book and trying its precepts for couple of days, I already feel my daily willpower getting stronger (I exercise regularly but I also added meditation to my regimen). If you read between-the-lines, you will also gather many subtle Psychological methods into gaining higher degree of control over your behavior and emotions.<br /><br />I recommend this book.
0071422943|5.0|I bought it used but in a good condition. That was really true, it is in good condition plus I didnot have to pay $200 for a new one. I am happy with the purchase
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It has no frills or complex calculation ability - but it's free.  Expecting more than that is just silly!  The size is great and it saved a few bucks on buying a new calculator with a screen that's bigger, for my middle aged eyes.

B002N7W3NK|5.0|I bought the single-disc edition of this DVD a few years ago at Best Buy.  The second disc is as good as the first, and it is a real treat.<br /><br />The first disc is the same as the original release.  Disc 2 has an additional 70 minutes of material, including a benefit performance in Toronto done solo by Diana, informal sessions from Madrid and Lisbon, a \\"rooftop session\\" from Rio, and the video for \\"Quiet Nights.\\"<br /><br />I won't detail the track listing because other reviewers already have.  The most intriguing track, for me, was the version of the old standard \\"P.S. I Love You,\\" recorded in Madrid.  Although not as well-known as The Beatles' first B-side of the same name, I'm surprised that Diana didn't get Paul McCartney to record the other \\"P.S.\\" on [[ASIN:B0076OW9DE Kisses On The Bottom]]. That would have been interesting!  Someday, someone will do a medley of the two.<br /><br />The booklet for the Special Edition also includes the lyrics for the songs on Disc 1; the original edition had only photographs.<br /><br />This Special Edition is a definite buy, whether or not you own the earlier DVD.

0345803507|5.0|Great book !! highly recommended. This book will have you at the edge of your seat, when not laying on your back ;) wink wink. Once you pick up this book it will be hard for you to put it down, believe me I read all three in 1 week. Keep in mind this book isn't children-friendly, avoid reading in public if possible. Enjoy!
0425263908|5.0|The similarities between the two books are pretty crazy - a 28 year old, screwed up, hot, bazillionaire - check.  A blushing, flushing, red faced young woman that just graduated college - check.  A man who never had any women in his home except housekeeping and family - check.  Saying they love each other after three weeks - check.<br /><br />I will say there is a little more to this story in that the woman character is more developed.  I like that they are both screwed up and trying to work together to figure out their lives.  I thought the writing was a little better and there wasn't so much S&M.  Don't get me wrong though - this is still a hot book!  If you like a hot book and don't mind that it is almost the same story line as 50 Shades then you'll like it.  I read the whole thing in less than 24 hours.  Looking forward to the second one.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its very entertaining and fun. it gives me something to do during work. and it helps keep kids entertained. la
B007P6VLRS|4.0|Rest assured Pumpkins fans, this is NOT Zeitgeist. And it does not disappoint.<br /><br />Yes, on first listen, it has that sort of slick processing and producing that's sort of become associated with Bjorn Thorsrud. Quasar starts the album off with a wall of guitar sound not heard since The Everlasting Gaze. It really sets the tone for the album where guitars and drumming are given priority.<br /><br />With that said, I don't feel that there's a single that truly stands head and shoulders above the others-- and that's good. Corgan emphasized that every song in this album is just as important as the others and he's accomplished that. Listening to this album streaming for several days prior to its release date, one thing was made VERY clear: this is an album best appreciated in whole. For example, the seamless transition between Quasar and Panopticon.<br /><br />Still if I had to pick favorites: Quasar, My Love is Winter, Pinwheels, and Oceania.<br /><br />I think it's a difficult album, in some ways like Machina I, to access and fully appreciate. It'll take several listens but there's a lot of depth and music in this one.<br /><br />Does Billy still have it? Oh yeah. THEY'VE got it.
0765316994|1.0|The only reason I didn't burn this book is because I borrowed it. What a lame piece of crap. I have really enjoyed his other books, but this! Very trite, lame writing. A convoluted plot that apparently was a send up of Star Trek. Not funny, not cute. What I did do was stop reading at the really ridiculous second coda. Jeez, I'm glad I didn't buy this!
B008469DGY|5.0|Love the flick games. This is one of the best. Great game while waiting in waiting rooms or that flicking train to go by. No commercials. No buying more crap to keep the game going ( not yet anyway).

B007J4T2G8|2.0|book started out good, i heard it was a nasty book, but didnt imagine all it had in it.  a little goes a long long way,  the s and m sex got boring after while, didnt finish the book, dont plan to.  would not waste my time on the other 2 sequels, oh my 2 sequels to this boring tale?  i can sure tell a man wrote this book.
0099579936|1.0|I UNFORTUNATELY ordered the trilogy because a few friends asked me \\"Have you read Fifty Shades? You should! You'd love it!\\" I'm a quick reader so I finished the first two books in three days. The friends who told me to read this don't read often, so when their friends told them to read this book, they came to me, knowing I love to read and recommended it. I should have realized who I was taking the recommendations from. I felt like I was reading an erotic novel written to a 9 year old's reading level. The imagination of this author is VERY LIMITED. She does not paint a picture well with her words AT ALL. It's always the same scenes and same boring phrases that have been overly abused. Just read the other reviews to find out what phrases she says OVER and OVER and OVER! I really just want to burn these books but my other friends who haven't read it have been borrowing it. And I don't want them to waste their hard earned cash for this crap. I know I wish I hadn't. I don't think I will ever buy another book from this author. Even the plot was weak for each book. Just stupid.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Although the sex in the book was very discriptive and borderline pornographic, the book was still able to maintain my attention with a great story line.  I read the whole trilogy and feel that the author should probably continue to write another book to describe in detail the childhood of Christian Grey. The books left too many unanswered questions, in my opinion. But still a great read and I have recommended to others.
B000XUOIQ4|4.0|Great Movie!  It's the age-old story of the damsel in distress and the reluctant hero who rescues her! One of Disney's best! Everyone should own this one! I
B007IXWL2C|4.0|great book again.. with a bit of suspense and drama.  book was able to describe more of Christian Grey's life and puzzle pieces were put together.. would love to read another book that can quench my curiosity of Christian's early childhood, before he came to the Grey's and his adolescense.  What made him the way he was.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|This is a jewel! When my son was 6 years old; He wanted to watch this movie ALL the time! He never got tired of it and honestly, neither did I! To this day, (my son is 33 now) when someone mentions Siamese cats, I still think of the song, \\"We are Siamese, if you please\\"! And I still laugh!! A movie for the ages!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|This book was not very well written, though the plot was interesting.  The sex scenes were not all that great.  All in all, I've read much more entertaining trashy novels than this.  Perhaps I ought to pass some of those on to my friends who thought this was a good read.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|I enjoyed reading all the three books of hunger games trilogy but the ending is just anti-climatic. President Snow is portrayed as a villain for the whole series and finally, he died for a trivial cause. Prim should never die at the end.
B000063DIH|5.0|Judging by the reviews on here I must be enjoying Iron Maiden's music for different reasons from many other fans.  I'm going to be the dissenting voice and say that this is my favourite Maiden album from the pre-Blaze period.<br /><br />To start with, I absolutely love the dry, hardrock-rather-than-metal, down to earth feel on this record.  The musicianship is excellent and second only to some of their later albums.  Perhaps the best highlights, to me personally, are From Here to Eternity, Weekend Warrior and The Apparation, but I skip no tracks on this album.  Not everyone's cuppa tea, I suppose.  But you can't slam it just because you're not up to it.<br /><br />One other point: this record gave a whole new dimension to the Maiden sound at the time.  A similar thing happened again on X Factor.  Something lost?  No regrets: lots is gained as well.  Rather than staying in their rut, Steve & Co kept on searching (as did Adrian and Bruce).  And you know what, everyone's better off for it today.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is the BEST notepad available! !!  Can be used on any android device and also accessed on  a PC! This is such a fntastic application.  Clipping from the web, picture notes, &amp; drawings. Tags, Edit, they thought of it all.  I will never stray and might even end up paying for the upgrade one day for more space.
0345803493|2.0|Hard to imagine the hype these books have created. There's better erotica published elsewhere. Anyway, the initial excitement in the first book has faded fast and the author is desparate for an interesting story line. The writing is unbearable at times. I had to balance reading another 500 pages in book 3 against my curosity of how it was going to end. I'll wait for the movie version (on Netflix).
0756405890|5.0|This is one of the books that completely absorbs you into its world. I listen to the audiobook version during my long commute to work and once I arrive, I have to snap myself back into reality. The story is so compelling, that I feel like I'm in that world. It's a great book. Well worth the time reading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is so fun! I spent hours playing it when I first got it. but the anoint plot points you receive for each game you complete is not enough to unlock games as you progress in the game and the points you need to unlock games becomes outrageous... even if you've completer all the games you have several times<br />Overall though this is a very entertaining game
B005KELQEU|1.0|This sleeve is not what is claimed: it does not fit Kindle Second Generation (with the keyboard), despite that model being pictured on the page.  The reason is simple: The dimensions cited on the website for this sleeve are 8\\" X 5.6\\" but the sleeve is only 7\\" X 5.2\\"--much too small to hold the Second Generation. I think that the actual model # for the Belkin sleeve that fits Kindle Two is F8N098, not the model # on the website.
0545091020|5.0|I love this story and was glad I purchased all three books on cd at the same time so that I did not have to wait to hear the entire thing. I drive a lot and love the convenience of listening while I drive. I've already started loaning these out. Also,I am enjoying the reader's voice. She does a great job with the different characters.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This is going to be a simple review.  I love this Blu-ray set - its so gorgeous it even makes Alien 3 and (almost) Alien Resurrection fun to watch.  Enough said?  You can see EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.  Not to mention the attention to detail in the packaging is amazing.  I don't really watch the extra features, but I think I'll get to those this time.  In the meantime, I'm going to continue to re-watch Alien and Aliens until my eyes drop out of my head.
B006P0FIGU|3.0|This movie is nothing to spend your money on. It finally came to me through Netflix and I was looking forward to something fresh and new from the Three Musketeers, but I guess there is no such thing.<br />It is the exact same story that's been done 100 times already but they added in DaVinci's flying machine or some such thing...I couldn't even get into it enough to pay attention to the details because it was so utterly disappointing right from the beginning! My kids distracted me from the flick and I was happy to let them because I was so bored....<br />If someone had never seen a movie about the Three Musketeers then I suppose it could be a fun flick, but for anyone who has seen other Musketeer movies this one was just a waste of time.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|Amazing, wonderful book that should need no introduction, but for those who aren't yet familiar with it, reading this novel will definitely sate your appetite for a good story, put you in touch with your humanity and bring out your Christmas cheer. Written in simple, lucid language, it can be reread as many times as you like, whether you be old or young. I strongly recommend a Christmas Carol.

B003EY7IRC|1.0|Long, drawn out and anti-climactic in the end. Peppered with unnecessary repetition, the entire series could easily have been a trilogy. Not in keeping with the author's past works. Despite the amount of time and space made available by the sheer length of the novels themselves, the character development was shallow and the plot convoluted but uninspired.Overall, a disappointing example of the genre and a long way to go for little reward. Sorry Karen, but not your best work although I suspect your heart was in it completely.

B000JML7EC|4.0|The free download for Kindle of \\"Treasure Island\\" is hardly a feature rich edition of the classic, but it does have the most important part, which is the novel itself.  Originally the book was serialized in \\"Young Folks\\" between 1881 and 1882, but was then published as a book on May 23rd of 1883.  \\"Treasure Island\\" is a wonderful adventure for younger readers, and has had an impact on popular culture.  The popular stereotype of pirates, and buried treasure marked by an X on a treasure map, all comes from this story.<br /><br />Most of the story is narrated by Jim Hawkins, the son of the owners of an inn, who becomes involved in a mystery involving sailors and treasure, though there are a few chapters narrated by Doctor Livesey, whom Jim looks to as a trusted magistrate.  The adventure takes place at some point in the 18th century, though one cannot determine the exact time frame and regardless it isn't important for the story.<br /><br />This is a great work for younger readers as it is full of adventure and interesting characters, and a young hero in Jim Hawkins.  The best known of the characters, though, is Long John Silver.  Hired as a cook for the expedition, it is no surprise that Silver turns out to be much more.  Silver has much more complexity and depth than any other character in the story, and that is perhaps the main thing that makes the story as engaging as it is.  There is no shortage of film adaptations and TV shows based on this work, and though its story is clearly of a time, the enjoyment of reading it is timeless.
0984183523|4.0|Proviso: haven't read CiP yet nor have I dug into the case rehearsal process. So maybe the demands of real prep will really change my evaluation. But, as a beginner trawling Google for case interview info, this felt more substantive than pretty much anything else out there - the few similar sites seemed less authentic, with their authors divulging less free sampler material. I gotta say, the plugging of the author's way-more-expensive audiovisual product gets old pretty fast...but whatever yo. Guy's gotta make a buck. Thanks Victor. If I wind up with the high-paying, leisure-time-mortgaging finance job of my dreams, you're the first inbox getting a MECE-formatted thank-you.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have to say this is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time.  Sounds so simple just use your finger to move the character around what is basically a maze (I love mazes) and pretty much that is all you do while collecting coins along the way but it really is just so much fun! Part of it is the graphics part of it is the speed (gets really fast after about 1000m) and part of it is the variety.  It seems like the &quot;temple&quot; is never the same twice so you never know what's coming so you never get bored. Just a great game!  If you haven't tried it yet.......TRY IT......it's free what have you got to lose. :)

1401235417|5.0|Gripping story-telling is one thing I never expected from a graphic novel. I expected nothing past \\"very interesting\\" to grace these pages, and this is coming from a huge Batman fan. But, here I am completely stunned from just finishing the book and I have to say, I cannot wait for Volume 2.<br /><br />This is a great read. So great, a review won't do it justice. Just know that the writing is on point and the art is on point (dare I say, perfect). Get this book. Its already a classic, and on my shelf right next to \\"Year One\\".
B0086700CM|5.0|its awesome. when your running it feels like your in the game! That's how great the graphics are! FIVE STAR GAME!
1401207529|5.0|You can't not have this book. Seriously!<br /><br />It's as old as I am, but a modern story that gives you a raw, rough, and original introduction to Batman, Commissioner Gordan, and Gotham City. Furthermore, this is the greatest origin story iteration of all time and a must-have for any true Batman fan.
0671027344|1.0|The bildungsroman--a work about a protagonist who develops from adulthood to childhood--has a long and storied history, with works ranging from those of Dickens to those of Salinger. Many of these have become required reading in high school. With any luck, The Perks of Being a Wallflower will not become one of those works.<br /><br />Written in the form of an epistolary novel, or a novel composed of letters, The Perks of Being a Wallflower recounts the freshman year of Charlie, a lachrymose, introverted student from some nameless high school. Charlie relates his manifold tribulations, which range from his problems socializing to his newfound discovery of drugs, to some nameless reader consistently referred to as \\"you.\\" Charlie's year progresses from being friendless to finding a group of fellow \\"outcasts\\" to his revealing the source of his angst.<br /><br />Aside from the triteness of its subject matter, the novel fails primarily to two ways: first, it never develops Charlie's character to a satisfactory degree. Second, its writing, in terms of both its syntactical and linguistic complexity--or lack thereof--reads like it was written by a child, which is surprising given the writer's comments on Charlie's \\"special\\" writing and intellectual ability.<br /><br />First, the lack of character development: throughout the novel, readers are repeatedly informed by other characters that Charlie is \\"sensitive\\" and \\"special\\" in his intellectual ability. Perhaps what the author means by \\"sensitive\\" is that Charlie cries a lot. He cries when he listens to his music. He cries when the girl he loves has sex with another person. He cries when he drives, when he walks, when he feels happy, sad, etc. Of course, the revelation at the end clarifies the source of his emotional state, rendering him slightly more sympathetic, but by this time, readers over the age of fifteen just want the tears to end. Those tears, by that point evoke the opposite response for which they are designed.<br/><br />The author similarly attributes a \\"special\\" gift to Charlie, when another character mentions that he's \\"one of the most gifted people [he's] even known\\" (181). The character continues to explain that his compliment is meant in relation to everyone, not just students. Given the extent of Charlie's thoughts--which tend to consist of banal musings along the lines of \\"I wanted to...shrug at how strange everyone was, especially me\\" (154) and how he feels \\"infinite\\" (33, 213, etc.) while listening to music--it's difficult to comprehend exactly what the author means. Few of his thoughts seem particularly insightful or original even for a freshman in high school.<br /><br />Which leads to the second problem: the prose of the novel does not read like a gifted child--or gifted author, for that matter--wrote it. The early letters are brutal, with strings of choppy independent clauses: \\"I don't think that there is a favorite kid in our family. There are three of us and I am the youngest. My brother is the oldest. He is a very good football player and likes his car. My sister is very pretty and mean to boys and she is in the middle. I get straight A's now like my sister and that is why they leave me alone\\" (5). Charlie does not elaborate or explain; he simply lists. This continues, in some places, for entire paragraphs.<br /><br />Let us grant, though, for the sake of argument that the author intended Charlie's style to develop as the year progresses and his ability grows. This assumption would be mistaken, as Charlie's prose style does not develop, and his lack of precise vocabulary--surprising, at the very least, for a supposedly \\"special\\" person--continues throughout. A typical passage from the novel's end will suffice: \\"So, I guess we are who we are for a lot of reasons. And maybe we'll never know most of them. But even if we don't have the power to choose where we came from, we can still choose where we go from there. We can still do things. And we can try to feel okay about them\\" (211). (Short aside: the author's predilection for placing coordinating conjunctions at the start of sentences becomes irritating long before this passage.) The language is so banal and overly simple (\\"things\\" and \\"okay\\") that it actually inhibits the narrator from expressing anything complex or interesting.<br /><br />Some readers might find the novel interesting. Perhaps it might mention a situation with drugs, alcohol, or sex that these readers find familiar. Outside of these readers, who are most likely still in high school, The Perks of Being a Wallflower holds little appeal. So many other bildungsromans have been written that reading this novel is essentially squandering an opportunity to read far more interesting novels, and this reviewer recommends that readers find one of those.
B0086700CM|5.0|It is really fun and addictive and I could play it for hours and not get bored! I recommend this to everyone
1932907009|5.0|Pretty much read most of the relevant screenwriting books out there.  This book (and the following two that Blake wrote) is by far the most helpful screenwriting book I've read.  I recommend it to everyone that asks about screenwriting books... whether it's a first timer, or a seasoned writer looking for additional insight.
B003VIWO8Y|5.0|I sure had a lot of fun learning about Mr. Mustaine's personal life and career.<br />I think he's one of the most gifted and talented musicians in the metal scene, too sad the guys from Metallica were not able to see that talent!
B001993Y3G|4.0|This is a great film and can stand the test of time.<br />I bought this because it had the music video included<br />which the DVD did not. Unfortunately, the music is from<br />a Bryan Adams concert and NOT the film's music video<br />which on the Laser Disc Edition is absolutely wonderful.<br />So, if like me, you want the original music video, it is<br />not on this Extended version on Blu-ray.
B0086700CM|5.0|the interface is really simple but there's a lot to master.  the graphics are speedy and the sense of urgency is palpable. wow.
B0019GJ4EC|5.0|Watched the Blu-Ray disc of The Fog. Bought the cheaper import. Awesome movie of course but the Blu-Ray version of the disc had a plus and a minus IMHO. The picture quality was top-notch but the sound was not the best. I usually can keep Blu-Ray movies down to a lower notch on my tv and they always has this booming sound. With my dvds I have to turn the tv volume up 4 to 5 notches higher than Blu-Ray movies. This one I had to turn way up to hear it. The scare scenes were really nice and loud but the talking scenes were very very low. Never had to turn any volume way up for other Blu-Ray discs. But the picture quality was amazing. Another thing, when I put the Blu-Ray in I had regional country options to choose from. No United States. So I chose United Kingdom and the movie started up just fine after that. I believe this is region free disc. I didn't have to do that with my Red Sonja Blu-Ray import which was released by the same company. Also, there are no special features with this Blu-Ray. Don't know if the other more expensive import has any special features but this one doesn't. So until the official United States release comes out I think this cheaper import will do the trick. Just don't expect great sound.

B000KIPD5E|3.0|Not expensive. Not cheap. Not exactly what I wanted.<br />Like most all of the Behringer items it has good points and \\"duh\\" points.<br /><br />If you use it as an  A/B one input to 2 outs, then you can use the 2 volume controls.  I did not need it for that.<br /><br />If you use it as 2 inputs and 1 out, you only control the sum out, not the individual inputs (thought you could, which is why I bought it. the 1/2 page twice translated fact sheet almost makes you think you can, but you can not.... I almost sent them back.. I bought 2 for a special set up needing to adjust the 2 input levels that I was switching).<br /><br />the LED indicators when using it as a 2 in - 1 out  (like 2 guitars into one amp, or in my case a mando and a midi-guitar rig into a single line in ) ...  are ...exactly backwards...  the one on the right (red) is actually the input on the left and the one on the left ( green) is the input on the right.... which makes it about as confusing to use as getting a weinersnitchel coupon that is good only at a sushi restaurant.<br /><br />Operation wise, no hums, no buzzes but no one left on bass.<br /><br />When it is all said and done, I am glad I kept them.<br /><br />Amazon rocks. got them in 3 days. free shipping.  where else can you take the change you find in the couch to coinstar, get a coupon with no fee and buy musical toys.  who said Santa was a scrouge.  i am just glad he took a nap and the money fell out of his pocket.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|In my review of season one, I indicated that I am not a zombie movie lover, I'm more like the \\"oh geeze, there's nothing else good on TV, but there is a zombie movie on, so...., ::big sigh:: I'll watch it\\" type of person.  I don't actively seek them out.  I have a vast dvd collection, yet do not possess one single zombie flick..... until now, (having bought season one of the Walking Dead a few months back). I will be increasing that theme ratio in the near future with more additions, even the one which frightened me as a child.... the original, old black and white \\"Night of the Living Dead\\".  I can look back now and see how campy it was, but it terrified me horribly as a wee bee and that may be why I did not become a huge fan of the genre.<br /><br />What can one say about season two of the Walking Dead?  It's definitely not like season one.  But then, season one had only six episodes to draw the viewer in to this new world order.  It was expertly done and people got hooked.  Season two is dealing with growing pains, both onscreen and off.  It has more episodes to attempt to flesh out the storyline, and doesn't have that frenetic pace that season one did.  The storyline did plod along in spots, but it allowed us to get to know new characters and allow us to become concerned about them.  (I still wonder what happened to Morgan and Duane, whether we'll ever run across a zombified Jim, how the Vatos fared, or the Hispanic family who took off in a different direction).<br /><br />In the search for one of their missing members, and also needing medical assistance, our group seems to have finally found the idyllic sanctuary they've been desperately looking for.  The Greene farm, which appears to have escaped relatively unscathed from any and all of the unearthly menace we know as the zombie apocalypse; seems like a little slice of heaven.  Honey, I'm home!!  Heck they don't even post sentries, such trusting souls they are!<br /><br />Rick desperately wants his group to beaccepted by the Greene clan so they can hopefully put an end to their travels by being able to set down roots on the farm.  However patriarch Hershel wants them all gone as soon as is feasibly possible.  Hershel expects the group to follow his rules while on his land.  As Rick starts to make positive progress with Hershel, of course, Shane has a tough time following those rules and soon Hershel's dark secret is known. Hershel's misguided faith and judgment, and how he wants thing done spells turmoil for Rick.  As Hershel doesn't see the rotlings as dead, but merely sick folks who at some point can be treated and get better, has Rick wrestling with what is the best course of action, when the decision is taken entirely out of his hands. The mid-season finale was a shocker.<br /><br />The power struggle between Rick and Shane reaches fevered pitch at times.  Rick would rather contemplate actions before implementing them, where Shane is a man of action, and sometimes it's reckless action.  You can darn near smell the testosterone as it hangs heavy in the air when these two go head to head.  The group wrestles with a huge moral dilemma when they come across rogue survivors. Are they no better than those they're trying to protect themselves from?<br /><br />Laurie is still her selfish and self absorbed self, (redundant, I know), allowing others to risk their safety in her behalf, while she seems to pass judgment on others in the group.... those who live in glass houses Laurie....I'm just sayin'.  Andrea becomes a force to be reckoned with as she learns to handle herself and a gun, and like Shane a bit reckless at times.  Carol has developed a bit of a spine.  Daryl is still AWESOME, using his tracking abilities to try and help locate their missing group member.  Glen finds a bit of happiness and takes risks that place him at odds with his new love interest Maggie.<br /><br />Carl seems to have become absolutely callused to this new world, and these human beings turned into the walking dead don't seem to faze him at all, to the point of him wandering into the woods and teasing and antagonizing a walker who's stuck in the mud, or actively encouraging his father to shoot someone the group feels is a threat to their safety.  Dale continues to try to be the voice of reason and poor T-Dog just kinda seems to be there in the background.  He's really not doing that much this season.  Hopefully that will change in season 3.<br /><br />We do lose some familiar faces this season, plus that beloved RV.... I LOVED that RV.... RIP... : )<br /><br />Not as in your face as season one was, but in my opinion, still worth buying and adding to a collection.  I'll be adding it to mine.<br /><br />~ jade ~
B007Z1FD7M|4.0|Mine just came in the mail from the UK this morning. Where it is great to have two full shows from this line up there is much to forgive in this release. First yes this is a DVD-A but you have to watch it in DTS to get the Video. Both DVD-A and DTS are 48/24 so there is not a huge difference anyway. The shows themselves are good but taken right from the start of the tour. The DVD from this tour might have the band playing a little tighter but there is a certain rawness to this that I find refreshing. It's not that the band is not tight because they are (they're King Crimson for God Sakes) but maybe it was the way it was recorded I don't know. I have a live double CD that came out from these shows and a few others of this run. But that CD says it was taken from a DAT so I am not sure how these shows fit into that senario.<br /> The DVD-A is basically band in front audience noise in back. A little of the band audio mixed into the back speakers to give you that live feel. I am not saying this is a bad product. Just don't expect those Beautiful mixes you are use to from the studio DVD-A's that Steve Wilson mixed. If you loved this period of Crimson I am sure you will be glad you picked them up. But you will also understand why it was released under the collectors club banner.
0143119680|2.0|Imagine a world populated by witches, vampires and daemons, coexisting in uneasy peace alongside oblivious humanity. Now take the most powerful of those witches, and throw her into a forbidden romance with an ancient vampire. The perfect formula for passion and dark intrigue, right? Well... no. Not according to Deborah Harkness, anyway.<br /><br />For one thing, there is no passion whatsoever in the witch-vampire relationship; not even of the slow-burning, suspenseful, smouldering kind. Our vampire simply falls for the witch post-haste, right off the bat (which is a bit baffling, given that the witch in question comes across as a smug, tedious stick-in-the-mud). Then the author has her reader trail around after this flaccid, remarkably unlikeable couple as they hang about in the library (same one, day after day); do a spot of yoga (yes, really); wax rhapsodic over a multitude of wines; make dinner; then more yoga... you get the picture. Apparently, in the world of Diana Bishop and Matthew Clairmont, supernatural life is very much like being a yuppie in the 90's, but with even more pretentious conversation, and absolutely no sex. Ever. At all.<br /><br />I love a bit of red-blooded escapism (and even daft romance), but somehow Deborah Harkness has managed to twist a fun, pulp-fantasy premise into something dull, pedantic, and ultimately irritating. I can only hope that the All Souls Trilogy concludes with Diana Bishop getting burned at the stake - preferably after said stake has been removed from Matthew Clairmont's crumbling chest. Bleh!
0547482655|5.0|A classic! The pop-up design makes it even cuter! Also, it's french edition, which is a plus - closer to the original one.
B000H4QD1O|4.0|I watched this show because it had been mentioned a few times as being good.  I don't think it was the greatest show ever made but I definitely enjoyed watching it.  I would like to see more than this one season and the movie, but that is obviously not going to happen.  So, for what it is, it is a very entertaining series.
B0086700CM|5.0|Great game!! My kids love it!! It is very addictive. I love that you can earn  the add ons with coins instead of money!!
B000YABYLA|1.0|I can't drink the Kool-Aid on this one folks, maybe because it isn't my demographic (?). For me, this movie is \\"Too too.\\" F<br /><br />or starters, the Ellen Page character...too wisecrakery, too smart, too \\"wise\\" to be believable - if you want to see a talented young actress, check out Jena Malone. This wore me out scene after scene (I didn't make it to the part where she softens up per the story formula). Michael Cera in the same role again (please don't become another Jason Alexander!).<br /><br />I wanted to like this, I really did. I love a solid coming of age movie but I couldn't stomach it through the second act. Maybe give it a try, you can always give it the whack - there are plenty of \\"red envelopes\\" out there to be had!
B000FBFN1U|4.0|I don't really need to say much other than if you liked the first two books, you will like this one, and if you didn't, you won't. Storm is as good as Game of Thrones, in my opinion. Very tightly plotted and paced, and all the unexpected twists we've come to love from Martin. The only character viewpoints I find a little less interesting is Davos and Stannis. Sansa thankfully begins to become more interesting and complex in this book. She seemed rather superficial in the early books, but she could turn out to be a very interesting character. Bran also shows promise and here he begins to discover his \\"special purpose\\" (he hates these cans!). We get to meet some interesting characters from beyond the wall and across the ocean, and there are hints that those regions in the southlands (Dorne) will be more important at some point.
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Two magician movies in the same year? How'd THAT happen?<br /><br />Since I didn't see myself watching both, I went with the Edward Norton flick after watching him in American History X and Fight Club - both which I enjoyed. Quite the stylized production, I found it easy to suspend my usual analytical eye and let the movie just go where it wanted...and take me with it. I found a number of the shots visually stunning and the movie just long enough to suit my attention span.<br /><br />I've since seen it again with a friend after my recommendation and enjoyed it almost as much the second time around.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The first impression I had when I started to read Fifty Shades of Grey was that the writing is surprisingly bad for such a popular book.  Not that popularity could be mistaken for any kind of reliable measure of quality, for some reason I expected better.  I had a fellow suggest the trilogy to me about a month ago, and I put it on the back burner at the time.  Then a ton of hoopla on the news about a movie being cast and I moved up my purchase to check it out.  Bravo to the author and her promotion for getting the cash out of me for something I should have waited to arrive on the \\"$3.99 or less\\" list.  Oh why, oh why didn't I try a sample for free on my Kindle this time?  I find the characters too whitewashed. One dimensional.  Too predictable.  Too perfect, with even the imperfections contrived.  Not far in to the book my second and biggest impression was the basic plot is based on some kind of Harlequin Romance style formula.  Beautiful girl who is completely oblivious of her own assets meets seemingly unattainable and perfect and extremely wealthy man, but he falls for her at first sight against all odds, blah blah blah.  Yep, it's fantasy, even with the kinks it's clean as a whistle, perfect to a fault.  Sterile.<br />I'm thinking the film may be better than the book, for a change, because perhaps they will get an actual good writer to work on the dialogue.  One can always hope.  I'll wait 'til it's at the Blockbuster kiosk for $1 anyway.  I just prefer Henry Miller, or Charles Bukowski.
B00003CXMG|5.0|Am I a sucker for coming of age movies? Yes. Is Kate Hudson adorable? Yes.<br /><br />Cameron Crowe hits it outta the park with his semi-autobiographical piece based upon his experiences touring with rock bands as a teen-age writer for Rolling Stone Magazine. The vulnerable, yet driven Patrick Fugit as William Miller is wonderful along with Frances McDormand as the neurotic Mom and Philip Seymour Hoffman as his muse. Kate Hudson puts butterflies in my stomach like girls did when I was in 8th grade. If you dig music or coming of age flicks, this is a \\"gotta see.\\" Yummy.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|This film was ahead of its time; now that technology is gaining speed - and passing humanity. . . this could very well be humans in the next 1000 years or less.
B00005M91K|3.0|Friends kept hammering me with this as a recommendation and frankly, I just watched it without reading a thing about it.<br /><br />Certainly well-produced visually, but I found myself feeling like I was grazing through video clips from the Getty image library. The documentary guy in me was frustrated without just a little context to go with the visuals. I dunno. Roll one up and watch this I guess but I found myself doing other things and glancing occasionally after about the first hour. Still, I suppose it's better than sticking a fork in your eye. For my time, I'd rather watch Planet Earth (ANY of them).
8866131369|5.0|First of all, let's be real - we all know you look way cooler when you're carrying around a Moleskine notebook. Moving on...<br /><br />I found the layout of the planner (daily on the left, lined notes page on the right) to be particularly helpful in terms of: 1) not having to carry around both a planner and a notebook; and 2) helping me remember relative dates of various ideas/thoughts. I also think it is imperative for planners to have a place for your general schedule (e.g., a place to put recurring events such as classes, meetings, etc.). This is included, and Moleskine allows you to provide your own time scale (e.g., by 30 minute increments, one hour increments, etc.). I have also found the back pocket with mini removable address notebook to be helpful - I'm not keeping addresses in there, but you can easily use this for whatever else you like. And, because it's replaceable, you can feel free to be free in there - if you screw something up, you can just take it out. This brings me to my last point: One of the reviewers noted that the pages are thin - I haven't found them to be too thin in terms of my writing showing through the page; HOWEVER, I did accidentally tear a page while erasing something. And, because I can't look at my planner if I know there's something wrong with it this early in the game, I just went ahead and bought another one. The good news is that it's so much cheaper on Amazon that I could actually afford to do that.
B000ZN802W|3.0|I had some fairly high hopes for this film. I love Sean Penn (tortured genious) and what he stands for, dig Eddie Vedder and I'm a fan of Jon Krakauer's novels (I was mesmerized by Into Thin Air). Home run I figured.<br /><br />The photography was wonderful but I didn't find myself relating too much with Christopher McCandless. Not because I'm a yuppie scum but I found him a little too glib and \\"quotey\\" for my liking. Hal Holbrook on the other hand, brought some real soul to the film...stuck, playful and most of all, loving. As a rental, you won't be poking your eyes out with a fork or anything but personally, I'm glad I didn't catch this at the theater.
B006G2124E|5.0|This was an interesting movie. I was amused at the antics and suprised that it depicted some of the characters the way it really was in the south. I enjoyed the movie.
B004X60QE2|2.0|Not quirky enough, not funny enough, not dark enough...basically, not \\"anything\\" enough to sit through. TV is full of examples of that this series tried to copy.<br /><br />Unfortunately for those of us who said \\"I'll give it a try,\\" we remain scratching our heads about how this made it past a pitch meeting in the post-cocaine Hollywood era. I love shows that aren't traditionally popular. This ain't one of those.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books will leave you wanting more. The author did a great job. I can't wait for the movie. I hope the do the story justice. Wow!!
B0013FSL0C|1.0|I must be watching a different show than the 5 star reviewers - I must be. I'm not even CLOSE to jumping on board with this series.<br /><br />First, I gotta question the casting of Byrne - and I usually like him. All the feigned pensive expressions (oh, wait - he took his glasses off!) and \\"tell me mores\\" had me literally sighing out loud. Second, who decided people in therapy shoved into a 30 minute segment was interesting or realistic?<br /><br />If you've been to therapy, it ISN'T THAT INTERESTING! Not to mention, shoving 3 acts into a half hour promotes some fairly forced turning points that I personally found contrived at best.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I keep it open on my Fire at my desk to keep me updated about the weather.  Awesome app.  Must have.
B00005JKG9|5.0|Glengarry GlenRoss might possibly be the best in two categories - best play adaptation and best ensemble cast...period. The context is tightly held, the performances magnificent from actors you'll recognize and love.<br /><br />Don't let the fact that you never heard about this movie keep you from seeing this absolute GEM! IF you've ever been in sales, you'll relate. If you haven't, you may still squirm a little. For my money, Pacino's Ricky Roma character is his best. Quotable. Memorable.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have no problems with it . but it does not have a exciting stuff in it.  that's all I would say

1451608659|5.0|This memoir is an amazing story about Dominque's life. She touches on all aspects of her life which helps the reader understand where she is coming from as she writes. Her chapter on the Karolyi's was the most interesting to me because I have always felt that they both put on a show for the media. This confirms that for me. I just hope USA gymnastics takes note and makes changes.<br />The story of her family saddens me but to know she is happy today make me feel better.<br />I highly recommend this book. An easy read with a great story.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game is relaxing and fun. the graphics are amazing and the music is beautiful.this game is awesome and worth all of the money!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|It is a really fun app but alot of times it is slow while i'm playing. Other than that,  its perfect.

1451648537|5.0|Walter  Isaacson has a style that captures the fiestyness of Steve Jobs and makes you want to lookup some old onstage presentations to just experiance the live Steve. The biography gets into the prickely world of Jobs and the ups and downs on the man that many think was a genius. It lets you know why the catch phrase \\"Think Different\\" didn't just apply to Apple computers and their fanatic users. Great book and makes you want to read more of  Isaacson's works.
0439023521|4.0|This was a very intriguing story of a young girl who braves a brutal adventure. It keeps you on the edge of your seat for sure and I have the second book ready to go! I loved the characters and the imagery-you could really see the landscape and feel what she was feeling thruoghout the book.
B004V6BQ3O|5.0|Thanks the nice products to help my video shooting and record the stereo sound.<br />Nice products i would recommend to someone.
B000W91RUG|4.0|My wife caught on to this first and had me start to watch it.  Coming from the geek culture of comic books and sci fi myself it's not a surprise that I find it often funny and you root for these dorks, these geeks, these persons who hold our future in their hands.  The main relationships revolve around roommates Sheldon Cooper (played smashingly by Jim Parsons with holier-than-thou grandiosity and pomposity) and Leonard Hofstadter (played understatedly by Johnny Galecki, the put-upon outside-the-window-looking-in dreamer), two of the comic book loving, sci-fi eschewing braniacs who get entangled with new neighbor Penny (played ditzilly by Kaley Cuoco, all broke dreams and big heart).  Leonard has a hankering for her while Sheldon doesn't phenomenologically understand what a hankering is and Penny?  Well, she's a sleep-around lush truth to tell so you know she's fair game for the usually out-of-everyone's-league Leonard.  Rounding out the cast for this first season are the bromance brothers, Howard Wolowitz (played by Simon Helberg who out-horndogs just about everyone, including Wilt Chamberlain) and Raj Koothrappalli (played by Kunal Nayyar playing up the smart guy from India with the Indian accent angle and who, unlike Howard, freezes up in the presence of pretty women and can't talk to them; the problem with Howard is that he can talk...about how much he would like to introduce each and every one of them to his little Wolowitz), two fellow scientists who have nothinig better to do than play Xbox deathmatches and visit the local comic shop with Leonard and Sheldon.<br /><br />The clever thing about this series is its mining of both geek and intellectual culture on collision with a more common, popular consumer culture.  The four guys are given their idiosyncracies and (unfortunately) Penny less so, she's more of a hot mess really, but perhaps she develops some in future seasons.  We'll see.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As Anastasia would say, \\"Holy Crap!\\" I fell for the hype and paid my hard-earned good money to download this amateurish tome onto my Kindle. I happen to be a professional proofreader and co-editor, and I can tell you I am mortified that this book is a best seller. Did the author use her word processor's proofreading add-on? A fifth grader could have written this book and had less glaring grammatical errors. And the story is laughable. So many people have written reviews on this book and have pretty much said exactly what I feel, only much better than I could, so I will not spend a lot of time going on and on. I don't write many reviews, but I had to chime in on this one. Don't waste your time or money.
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Pros:I got this onsale when amd slashed the price since they introduced the fx 4170. It performed very well out of the box, and even better with a hyper 212 from cooler master. I was considering an i5 over this and worried that amd might have been a dude. I was wrong, paired with dual HIS 6870 cards it handles anything i can throw at it and then some. Love it, its worth it for the cash.<br /><br />Cons: I had some inital problems on boot up because of some out dated drivers, i just downloaded the lastest ones off amds site and it fix it right away.
0763655465|2.0|I was hoping for more like the Little Owl Lost book which was entertaining for kids and adults.  But Oh No, George! is not as linear of a story and doesn't catch the interest of my little reader.  But I'll eagerly await the next book!
B0086700CM|4.0|Fun but challenging for sure. Moves very fast!! Still wondering what the heck those things chasing you are....but they'd make me run faster too.
B0084M6HLC|5.0|Plain and simple: I'm a 'Lincoln Lawyer' fan and I enjoyed this book. And with it, of course, you get Harry Bosch as well, not to mention a very well told story that methodically takes us through a new trial for an old crime (hence, the title). For some, it might take the slow pace of justice but for others like me, it is a well constructed novel with no wasted dialogue or pointless action for action's sake. The tension that builds is strong enough to carry the story and Connelly builds it convincingly enough.<br />  I read it in four days, which is shame actually, because it takes a lot of effort on Connelly's part to construct it, and we readers race through it at a clip, nod and say, 'Okay...so where's the next one?'<br />  Well worth a read.
0345803493|5.0|Received the book as promised. Thank you for your fast service. The book arrived in great condition. When I read this book I will let you know seems like a cool book.
B007SPN5MA|5.0|When I am under Hansard's spell, which happens pretty much the moment I hear his voice, I am transported out of myself into a world of sound and color, of aching sadness balanced on the knife's edge of longing.  Each of the songs on this album explores the deep places of the heart, gently and probingly, but fearlessly.  Hansard never lets us escape into an easy answer; he relentlessly demands honesty, and delivers it himself.  If you are familiar with his work on \\"Once\\", you have seen just a fraction of what this man is capable of producing.  Don't stop.  Your bravery will be repaid as Hansard weaves his spell upon you as well.

B007VTVGFQ|5.0|Put this record on and trust yourself in the hands of a master songwriter, one of the most self assured singers, and one of the most amazing creative talents currently putting out music.  Fiona is never one to rush things, and that is fine with me if every record is as fine as this one--her voice is varies from gentle, flexible, supple melodicism to sweet and plaintive to whipcord tough soul, sometimes in a moment that stretches longer than the second it takes to sing.  She is strong, she is in control, and she is here to show you that she is only getting better at what she does.<br /><br />\\"Every Single Night\\" starts out quietly, with a vibraphone/toy piano sound, joined by an acoustic base; she starts softly, soon becomes demanding:  \\"That's when the pain comes in...Like a second skeleton/Trying to fit beneath the skin/I can't fit the feelings in/Every single night's alright with my brain.\\" There are not words at my disposal to describe the emotional changes that this song brings you through, but it had my mouth open in disbelief, it was so powerful.<br /><br />\\"Werewolf\\" is another standout track, starting with \\"I could liken you to a werewolf the way you left me for dead...But I admit that I provided a full moon...\\" set to a chiming piano.  This dichotomy, this my fault/your fault push and pull is something that she excels at, and this song is no exception, and it is developed into a description of an obsessive relationship, full of pain but full of fire:  \\"We are like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity/ But we can still support each other, all we gotta do's avoid each other/Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.\\"<br /><br />\\"If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife, He makes my heart a cinemascope...\\" she croons to an insistent tom tom beat on \\"Hot Knife\\" and soon a dark dancing piano figure comes in, and Fiona, tight and controlled begins doubling her voice, harmonizing, twisting in and out of her own melodies, forming a complex web of sound that isstill focused and sharp. It is an astonishing achievement that she pulls off with laser like focus.<br /><br />This may be Fiona's finest album, but will not please everyone.  None of these songs are probably going to blaze up the top 40--but they should.  None of these songs will give you peace, leave you alone, let you rest.  They will infect your consciousness with their insistent beat, their multi-layered meanings, and their incredible vision.  This is a mature album from an artist who is simply satisfied only when she has put out greatness.  Strongly recommended.<br /><br />The bonus package provides a DVD that is worth the extra money, and Fiona's art is definitely interesting.
B006ZCWU5K|3.0|I bought this item as a birthday gift for my son.  He seemed really happy with it, and we were pleased with the service.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|The Smashing Pumpkins made little sense to me when I first heard them 20+ years ago.  Billy Corgan's snarling croon was hard for me to get used to...but one day, when I wasn't meaning to dissect their music, to understand it, it got inside me.  The hard drone, the nasal sneer, the driving drums, the delicate lyrics that could sledgehammer straight into your soul...they got me at an emotional level.  So when I hear that there is a new SP album out after all this time...well, I know I'm gonna get it, right?  But I also tell myself not to expect another Siamese Dream.  And that is good, because this isn't Siamese Dream.  This is a mature, fully realized work of pure rock and roll fire.  Billy's voice is piercing, snarling, and the guitars are sharp and loud.  This new drummer is hungry, fierce, and out to add something grand to the music.<br /><br />Standouts for me include the driving opener, \\"Quasar\\" and the melancholy of \\"My Love is Winter\\".  \\"Pale Horse\\" feels like a moment out of time, a gorgeous heartbreak of a song.  Billy opens the song \\"if i was ...i'd turn back...give up all my reasons...forget the past\\" and by the end up as he begs the \\"pale horse\\" to \\"please come back, please come back, please come back\\" I have to fight back the chillbumps crawling across my arms--creepy, haunting, beautiful.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a great album, a worthy piece of the SP legacy, a work to dig into and dissect, but also to let carry you away on rivers of sound.  Let it in.
B007KW55VK|4.0|Rumer mentioned in her St. James Church concert that she is working on an album of new material which will be released at the end of 2012, but she didn't want to keep her fans waiting so she released this album over 70s cover songs: \\"Boys Don't Cry\\".<br /><br />This album definitely is a slow-burner. It is not as instantly-catchy as I found her first album \\"Seasons of my Soul\\" was, so I implore you to repeat the album a few times for it to become enjoyable. It definitely wasn't a smart commercial move for Rumer to release an album of obscure covers for her sophomore album, but I appreciate this album was a gift for her (growing!) fanbase. Cover Albums only sell well once an artist has an established fan-base, so I doubt this album will be lighting up the Charts. But, I imagine that Rumer had to fight hard with her Record Company to get the OK to release this album...so kudos to her for not \\"selling-out\\" and releasing some AutoTune mainstream crap featuring LMFAO!<br /><br />Rumer's first album had a more 70s Carpenters influence, but this album almost has a country-twang to most songs...and Rumer uses her higher vocal range on songs like \\"Sara Smile\\" which Karen Carpenter never would have done. I am glad Rumer is not trying to be a Karen sound-a-like on this album...but rather she is developing her own voice and style. If you can find Rumer's live version of \\"This Masquerade\\" you will see that Rumer doesn't sing like Karen Carpenter at all. The album production and over-dubbing are similar to Carpenters-style...but Rumer uses her higher singing register more frequently on this album.<br /><br />The stand-out tracks on \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" are \\"It Could Be The First Day\\" which would have been a great album opener, instead of \\"P.F. Sloan\\". \\"Be Nice To Me\\" is a sweet song with a simple melody. \\"Travelin' Boy\\" sounds very much like the Carpenters song \\"Hideaway\\". The line \\"I won't say that I'll be back again/'cause time alone will tell\\" sounds exactly like the line from that Carpenters track: \\"I'll save my pennies for a rainy day/but where can I buy another you\\". The bonus track \\"Soul Rebel\\" has instrumentation like The Eagles song \\"Tequila Sunrise\\". It's a cosy (almost sexy!) campfire type sing-a-long song which Rumer sings effortlessly. \\"A Man Needs A Maid\\" sounds like a misogynistic song title, but Rumer sings the lyrics to this Neil Young tune very articulately and intimately.<br /><br />My absolute favourite track on the album is \\"We Will\\", originally by Gilbert O'Sullivan! It is a very un-assuming song with a subtle melody that you could miss on the first listen...but once you catch it, the earworm gets stuck in your head! It is a beautiful song that tells a story...three little vignettes about life: a mother telling her children to go to bed, a visit from Uncle Frank and Auntie May, and kids planning a soccer game. The original O'Sullivan version is a bit schmaltzy because he used a children's choir to sing the (brief) chorus...but Rumer sings her entire version and it is a tear-jerker. I am not sure if the British slang featured in the song would be understood by American fans...but it is a very realistic song that Rumer casually and effectively floats through.<br /><br />My only disappointment is that some of the best cover versions Rumer has sung did not end up on this album. I urge you to seek out Rumer's version of \\"Welcome Back\\". Yes, it is the theme to a cheesy 70s TV show starring John Travolta...but her interpretation is just so catchy and joyous. It really should have been included on the album because it isn't a morose ballad like most of the album tracks. She also did a gorgeous version of \\"Moon River\\" which was flawless...but sadly that didn't make the cut (Although \\"My Cricket\\", which is on this album, sounds similar to \\"Moon River\\"). Rumer also released a cover of Randy Newman's \\"Marie\\" on her Facebook which was beautiful! Hopefully, this surfaces as a B-Side.<br /><br />Some of the cover version are a bit disappointing. Nothing to do with Rumer's vocals...but rather the song selection. \\"P.F Sloan\\" has a repetitive and droning hook, but I can understand why it was released as a lead single, as it is the song on this album that has the most percussion+beat to be radio-friendly...but, I find the \\"No-n-n-no-n-no-n-no-no-no-no\\" irritating. \\"Soulsville\\" ventures into Joss Stone territory (the whole \\"white-British-girl-trying-to-sound-like-a-black-gospel-singer schtick). \\"Home Thoughts From Abroad\\" is song about missing your lover, which literally uses the chorus \\"I miss you\\"...a bit too uninspired.<br /><br />While I appreciate Rumer selecting obscure album tracks instead of standard cover songs...honestly, sometimes there is a reason certain songs weren't released as a Single in the first place and why some songs just stayed album tracks. Some of these songs were \\"filler\\" album tracks back then...and they are still \\"filler\\" album tracks now. I have listened to \\"Brave Awakenings\\" , \\"Just For A Moment\\" and \\"Andre Johray\\" about 10 times each, and while Rumer's voice is on-point, the melodies are subtle...almost TOO subtle to be catchy enough to make me want to hit the Repeat button.<br /><br />Honestly, I am more excited about the next album of original Rumer songs to be released at the end of this year...but this album is pleasant enough to pass the time. I strongly recommend getting the Deluxe Version...as the four Bonus Tracks are better than some of the album tracks.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Put this record on and trust yourself in the hands of a master songwriter, one of the most self assured singers, and one of the most amazing creative talents currently putting out music. Fiona is never one to rush things, and that is fine with me if every record is as fine as this one--her voice is varies from gentle, flexible, supple melodicism to sweet and plaintive to whipcord tough soul, sometimes in a moment that stretches longer than the second it takes to sing. She is strong, she is in control, and she is here to show you that she is only getting better at what she does.<br /><br />\\"Every Single Night\\" starts out quietly, with a vibraphone/toy piano sound, joined by an acoustic base; she starts softly, soon becomes demanding: \\"That's when the pain comes in...Like a second skeleton/Trying to fit beneath the skin/I can't fit the feelings in/Every single night's alright with my brain.\\" There are not words at my disposal to describe the emotional changes that this song brings you through, but it had my mouth open in disbelief, it was so powerful.<br /><br />\\"Werewolf\\" is another standout track, starting with \\"I could liken you to a werewolf the way you left me for dead...But I admit that I provided a full moon...\\" set to a chiming piano. This dichotomy, this my fault/your fault push and pull is something that she excels at, and this song is no exception, and it is developed into a description of an obsessive relationship, full of pain but full of fire: \\"We are like a wishing well and a bolt of electricity/ But we can still support each other, all we gotta do's avoid each other/Nothing wrong when a song ends in a minor key.\\"<br /><br />\\"If I'm butter, then he's a hot knife, He makes my heart a cinemascope...\\" she croons to an insistent tom tom beat on \\"Hot Knife\\" and soon a dark dancing piano figure comes in, and Fiona, tight and controlled begins harmonizing with her sister, twisting in and out of each other's melodies, forming a complex web of sound that is still focused and sharp. It is an astonishing achievement that she pulls off with laser like focus, and her sister's voice is not only a fantastic counterpoint to her own, but is hauntingly similar.<br /><br />This may be Fiona's finest album, but will not please everyone. None of these songs are probably going to blaze up the top 40--but they should. None of these songs will give you peace, leave you alone, let you rest. They will infect your consciousness with their insistent beat, their multi-layered meanings, and their incredible vision. This is a mature album from an artist who is simply satisfied only when she has put out greatness. Strongly recommended.
B0000A118M|5.0|There is not much to say other than excellent and superb! A real classic for Coltrane lovers. One of my favorites!
B007VT6QSI|5.0|Bieber is so hyped that sometimes it is hard to remember how truly talented this young man is--but the truth is that he has a fantastic voice, and delivers heartfelt performances with a maturity that belies his years.  His supple tenor is still light and sweet, but has a depth that indicates that he is growing up; his lyrics are still sweet as well, but there is an edge to the wonder, a charge that wasn't there before.  Songwriting is uniformly enjoyable and exciting.  Why should we fight the feeling? Bieber asks.  And I agree--why should I fight this album?  It is pure pleasure from beginning to end.  Don't be ashamed to be a Belieber, just give yourself over to his beats, to his voice, and have a great time.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My grandson wanted to see the movie, but before I would let him I decided to purchase the book to get what the theme was about.  There was nothing in the book that I thought might not be suitable for him.  He has read the first and second books now and we talk about them and how much he and his buddies in school also discuss the books.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read.  Inserting bondage into a really weak love story does not make it unique.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Most fans have been waiting for something like this. For me I haven't hated anything since 2007, but at the same time I haven't fallen in love with much of it either. With Zeitgeist, Corgan came back with Jimmy C and created a rock record that...rocked. That was pretty much it however, it lacked a certain passion and perhaps even some angst that previous records had. It was as if the band going through the motions and just putting out something they figured fans wanted. After a short while the band came out with Teargarden By Kaleidoscope, an interesting concept at the time. Still the songs weren't making us feel much, although most were catchy tunes (I happen to really like, Stitch In Time.)<br /><br />Soon, out of nowhere, there was talk of a new album. I was excited and curious on how it would sound. Would it be more of what I was hearing or would there be some heart and soul added to it. Billy was never one to leave that out of the mix, but perhaps it was a bit toned down lately. He's recently come to terms with things and realized what he'd been doing wrong. There are plenty of great interviews out there today that will prove to that, if you can ignore all the things YOU don't want to hear. I say let Corgan speak his mind, he has a right to as you have a right to complain about things you hear or see.<br /><br />Anyway, before I ramble far too much, we are left with the new record Oceania. I cannot start to say how pleased I am with this. I will also not say it sounds like classic 90's Pumpkins cause that era is gone. It does however, capture that feeling the band had at the time. The songs strike a certain chord in my heart and I honestly got a bit choked up on just the second track! For me, I was proud and it was as if I had found my favorite band all over again (Been my favorite band since '96). Even though most of the members are new, they succeeded in bring us (or me) music that has heart, soul, and passion. Billy's vocals are back on track too, and you hear him giving a bit of himself to you once more. If this is only the beginning for what the Pumpkins have in store for us now, then I am very happy to still be on board. Oceania is a gift, and one I will treasure for my entire life I am sure.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I had been looking for a clear case to display the beauty and sleakness of the white iPhone rather than covering it up with a bulky, hard case and I am glad I ended up looking at this case. I previously bought one of those cheap $2 clear cases from China on Amazon and it looked alright at first, but more importantly it did not fit well (bulged at the sides) resulting in the lock/volume/mute buttons being rendered useless and making the case come off easy. This case has a perfect, skin tight fit while allowing very easy access to all the buttons. It it pretty sleek for the amount of protection it feels it could take. Has plenty of grip while still being slick to fit in your pockets easily. The outer lip on the screen side of the phone sticks out a bit to protect the screen from being scratched if it is every dropped or put face down. Additionally, the screen protector that comes free with the case is top notch; its a perfect fit and seems exactly how the phone felt and looked when there was no protector. The case at times doesn't work well with the flash, but its not too bad. The concentric circle design on the back is not that bad and grows on you while allowing for an extra space between the phone and the case to add protection as well as to avoid the oil type effect on the back. Hopefully, this case lasts long and for the price I wouldn't mind buying a new one anyway...already bought another one for my dad's iPhone as well!
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great game with tons of levels. Good smooth play with fun bonus features. So entertained I am looking into other games from them.
0345803507|1.0|Really? There are actually people who made it this far with this book? Astounding. I couldn't get past the first 100 pages of the FIRST volume of this, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", let alone all the way to Vol. THREE. Good GOD. I read the endings to all of these just because I couldn't bear to read any more of this redundant crap. Even the sex scenes are repetitive. The worst thing about this whole trilogy is that this chick is actually making MONEY off of this; I read a bit of her original story of this online, and she names all the characters after Twilight characters but has changed them in the \\"novels\\". (She has a character named \\"Sawyer\\", as in Sawyer from the \\"Lost\\" t.v. series---can't this chick come up with ANYTHING original in this???) It's such a ripoff---all I can say is thank God for libraries--I wouldn't shell out $10.00 for ANY of this crap. I'm a writer and I spent the 100 pages I DID read thinking, \\"Good LORD. I wrote better than this in HIGH SCHOOL...\\" I wonder if I rip off Harry Potter and just change all the names, toss in some kinked-out sex scenes between Harry & Hermoine, and make both of them complete idiots with a 50-word vocabulary if I also could make a mint on this sort of garbage? Why, oh WHY can't I give this ZERO stars???
1451608659|5.0|I've been a fan of Dominique's for as long as I can remember. Living in Brazil, it wasn't always easy to follow her career in a time when we didn't have youtube, facebook or twitter... I grew up watching her perform in the world's most prestigious competitions, and ultimately watched her become an Olympic Champion in the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta. What I loved most about her was that big, beautiful smile she flashed to the audience and the cameras whenever she was performing that just made everything look so easy and effortless! I guess that's why America and the world fell in love with her. But little did we know that behind all that, there was a terrified little girl who was being physically, emotionally and mentally abused and humiliated by the very people who were supposed to love, care and protect her.<br />This book does a great job in telling the whole story from Dominique's point of view maybe for the first time ever. She's blunt honest, straight forward in telling the story of her own life, and for the first time we can really understand where she's coming from and what was happening in her life before, during and after Atlanta. The family feud, the loss of all her money, her escape from home at the age of seventeen, the freedom, the parties, the drugs and all the injuries that ultimately took their toll on her and forced her to retire prematurely. Not to mention her secret sister!<br />But one of the most interesting issues mentioned by her is the politics behind the US Women's Gymnastics program and how ugly and unfair it can be. I was shocked to hear about her life with the Karolyis, especially because, like many others, I believed the show they put on for the cameras! I can honestly say that I lost all the respect I had for them, and, no matter how many medals they have under their belt (and at the expense of how many gymnasts!), they will never be more than losers to me. It truly disgusted me!<br />But better than everything else was just discovering what an amazing, strong, beautiful (inside and out!) woman Dominique turned out to be after everything she's been through. She's been to hell and back in more ways than one, but somehow managed to stay true to herself and learn from her experiences. The last chapter brought tears to my eyes as she described the last days with her father and how they reconciled... All in all, it is a beautiful story worth of everybody's attention - gymnastics fan or not! - and I'm really proud to say I'm a fan of hers!
B007PBKG5G|4.0|I heard a couple cuts from this album on the radio.  They intrigued me enough to buy it.  I was pleased to discover that the entire album is quite good.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The  service  of  Amazone  is  very GOOD  .I  do  love the  speed  they send the CD,s to  me  never a  problem.Thanks
B007M458CW|4.0|I'm only a an occasional Dr. John fan, being that I like the more evocative and spookier grooves he gave us, like on his classic debut album \\"Gris-Gris\\".  Other than a few singles here and there, I never bought any of his albums since.  Well, I bought this one!  It's a great modern return to that mystical \\"voodoo\\" sound only he can create. I only gave this album 4 stars though, because there were maybe two songs that I can't quit get into.  All in all a great album.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just loved the entire series of the hunger games. They are all page turners and a fast read.YOu can't read one with out reading the entire series. Loed it.
B000ENC6XM|4.0|Constantine isn't Citizen Kane, but then few movies are. I've heard it compared unfavorably to The Exorcist, but heretically I must disagree. The Exorcist has always seemed more funny than scary, OR believeable, and this just gets worse as the years go by. (The scariest bit of the Exorcist was over by minute 10 in the movie). Perhaps it makes a difference if you're a Catholic instead of a Prod.<br /><br />ANYWAY, this movie is NOT muddled, it sounds just fine on a normal TV, (can't comment upon home theater), is not a great copy of the comic books, but frankly that is an improvement in my view. That being said this was a pretyy darn good supernatural action-type thriller. The theology was not so bad (aside from mixing up verse references in the Bible: book, chapter, verse). All in all I was astounded to find that the movie did not get a better reception. I DO have suspicions however.<br /><br />At the end of \\" Ironman \\" there is one of those irritating \\"after movies\\". The room was full of comic book nerds and when S. Jackson came on the screen they all ooohhed \\" Nick Fury!!!\\". My son and I who saw it with my brother (who is a comic book nerd) laughed out loud and pissed off my bro. Some of these folks demand exact correspondence to their childhood fantasies, and when they don't get them they take their revenge. All that I can say for it is that I liked it quite a bit as a stand alone movie and wish that they had made more.
B0054XOMX4|3.0|Desription says \\"Authentic Japanese release licensed by TAKARA TOMY (Japan)\\". But to be more specific, this should have been said \\"Authentic Korean release licensed by TAKARA TOMY (Japan)\\".  This is still an authentic Takara Tomy product and there is nothing wrong with the toy itself. But my son was a little disappointed about the packaging not being \\"Real Japanese\\" (he collects boxes and all). He decided not to return it because he didn't want to wait any longer.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|This Angry Birds Game is the \\"bomb\\".  The graphics are great! It's just too hard to put down once I start playing. I do still manage to read on my Fire sometimes.
0525478817|2.0|I didn't like this book.<br /><br />I had never read a John Green book. I had never even cared to, until my best friend read it, liked it a lot, and recommended it to me. I should probably say that I'm not a fan of Young Adult literature (and neither is she). There are a few exceptions (The Book Thief, notably), so I was more than willing to give this book a go.<br /><br />As soon as I read the first chapter, I knew I wouldn't like it. I felt that Hazel was too witty, too clever to be a real person. Intelligence does not ruin a character or make them unbelievable, but she says things in a way no real person would.<br /><br />Worse still was Augustus. I thought Hazel was a bit unrealistic, but I liked her alright. I could not stand Augustus. Everything about him, his name, his method of speech, his looks, annoyed me. He's attractive. He has a unique name. He speaks entirely in pretty metaphors. I hated him more with every single word he spoke. I don't like to throw the label \\"Mary Sue\\" around at all, but I'm willing to apply it here.<br /><br />Everything about this book is pretentious. There's always a trite metaphor, always a poem to quote, always something that reminds me that these are characters in a book, rather than everyday people. John Green can write beautifully, but that beauty overwhelms everything, and the emotion never feels quite real.<br /><br />This is a shame, because clearly, John Green can write. I loved Hazel's parents (especially her father). They were very real, vulnerable, and human. Their parts of the book were the only bits that made me feel anything except annoyance.<br /><br />That all said, I can see how people like this book, and it certainly was not the worst book I've ever read. Still, not my cup of tea, and I won't be reading any of his other books.

B00723NWJE|5.0|regardless of what people complain about, I think that Norah is being much more unconventional and creative than before, I mean come on! did you expect her to stick with jazz music for ever!, the album itself is so bold and dark and nothing like her previous work, and I'm actually quite fond of this album as I enjoyed it more than her other efforts, higly recommend this album, my top picks are Good Morning, Little Broken Hearts, She's 22, Take it Back And Miriam.<br /><br />-Liza.H

B007B5EDEG|4.0|I found the collections download very fast and set up of the ereader very easy to navigate  the  set up of the books excellent. I had seen 2 seasons of the TV series which draged me into the story I brought the ebook 5 volume version and found the book to be a whole lot more interesting with the extra background stories,its an good flowing story line which keeps the reader interested in the different characters and there lives, I am almost through the first volume and cant wait to read the other 4 volumes I can see there will be some late night  reading furously to find the next installment. I would recomment anyone who likes a great story this is the one.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|This album could only be bettered if there was another album with ukulele, whistling, yodeling, harmonica and kazoos.  There just are not enough songs made these days with these techniques and instruments.  Indicative of a lack of creativity.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|I read the biography entitled \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and was intrigued to learn more about this incredibly gifted and humane man who just happened to have been part of my favorite singing group. This is an extremely well done biography and I recommend it to any and all, Beatles fan or not. I started having children about the time of Sergeant Pepper and pretty much tuned out the Fab Four in lieu of diapers and playground equipment. I now wish I'd have followed the career of post-Beatles George much closer. But, since I didn't, Martin Scorcese has beautifully chronicled George Harrison's life and career and appropriately highlighted his amazing talent - musically and in the greatest humanitarian sense. You HAVE to see this!
B007K3JCAE|1.0|Dear Warner's Brothers,<br />Please get rid of your partnership with Flickster/UltraViolet. I am not amused by having to download another application on my desktop or iPad just to view the digital copy.<br />ALL who have an iPhone/iPad are already using iTunes to manage their movies, so get on with it.<br />Stop your attempts to branch off to start another one of your own.<br />I feel cheated that my digital copy must be viewed using another application and I am NOT happy !!!<br /><br />Also, when I go the WB website to send this feedback to your Corporate, there are many layers of filters in the web-forms.<br />Frustration is all I can say even with trying to send your guys feedback. The amount of frustration is so much, it is carved deeply into my mind now.<br /><br />If ever I see UltraViolet or Flickster in the future, you can be assured, I will NOT buy it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good clean fun.  could use more excitement.  feels repeatitive but also addicting.  reminds me of older videogames from my childhood
B007TG34QU|5.0|I concede to being a great admirer of Rachel Podger's artistry; she is a virtuoso who plays every note and phrase as if that note or phrase is the most sublime music ever composed.  She believes in this music, she respects it and loves it and all this is immediately apparent from the very first track.  Her previous Vivaldi release, La Stravaganza, won numerous critical awards.<br /><br />So Ms. Podger is superb.  But, and a large but, the Holland Baroque Society match her note for note, phrase for phrase, and to use a jazz quality: they \\"swing\\" like no other small Baroque band I have heard.<br /><br />The recorded sound is stunning from the lowest bass notes to the highest violin notes the presentation is crackling and full of startling impact and richness.  This is demonstration quality audio.<br /><br />Buy this set.  Do it today.  Just kidding.  Buy it immediately after you read this review.

B007P6VLRS|4.0|Well Pumpkins fans, you can finally wave your freak flag proudly once again after the release of 'Oceania.' As a longtime fan of the band, and I'm sure some of you can relate, I'd started to lose faith after the cold, relentless bombast of 2007's (mostly) underwhelming 'Zeitgeist' and the ongoing, extremely hit-or-miss Teargarden project, of which 'Oceania' is supposedly a part, but I would still always list them as one of my two or three favorite bands out of some weird sense of loyalty. I didn't really have high expectations for this album, but the fact is, Corgan is reinvigorated here, with a renewed focus; the songwriting, lyrics, and vocals all at their best in years.<br /><br />'Oceania' also feels like the product of an actual band, with backing vocals from bassist Nicole Fiorentino and drummer Mike Byrne, instead of the \\"million Billy choir\\" heard on much of 'Zeitgeist,' and this is a definite plus. Jeff Shroeder is treated as an equal when it comes to the guitar leads and solos, as opposed to Corgan constantly busting through the mix (Outta my way!), and proceeding to shred, he and his guitar catching fire from rocking so hard. Thankfully there are still plenty of impressive solos, but they seem to be divided equally between the two, with a few dual leads as well, which is refreshing, as Jeff has his own unique, fluid style that provides a nice contrast to Billy's \\"Guitar Hero\\" histrionics. Nicole seems to be given a lot more freedom to add her own flourishes compared to Corgan's past bassists, and she proves to be a dynamic player, at times even funky, which is new to SP. And while Jimmy Chamberlin is nearly impossible to replace, Mike Byrne more than holds his own here, with progressive rock-style rhythms and time-signatures throughout, giving many of these songs a fresh sound, with an entirely different feel from Jimmy's more jazz-influenced style.<br /><br />Following the tradition of the past few Pumpkins albums going back to Machina 1, the album openswith the heaviest song on the album, \\"Quasar\\" (beginning one of the strongest opening six-packs of songs in SP history), a sonic assault with walls of skull-crushing guitars that you can either headbang to, or drift away to a state of hypnotized euphoria. The lyrics seemed a little cheesy to me at first, with \\"God, right on! Krishna, right on!\\" being the first words out of Billy's mouth, but eventually it becomes an ode to lost friends when the words change to \\"ride on,\\" and the list of names goes on to include longtime friends (and 60's tripsters) who are no longer with us, like \\"Mark\\" (Tulin) of Electric Prunes fame, and \\"Sunlight,\\" which I'm assuming refers to Sky \\"Sunlight\\" Saxon of The Seeds, to whom Corgan dedicated his short-lived supergroup Spirits in the Sky. The dreamy \\"Panopticon\\" follows in a similar vein musically, and at first I thought it was like a second act to \\"Quasar,\\" the two seemed to fit together so perfectly, and it contains one of the most emotional and cathartic choruses in Pumpkins history, imo.<br /><br />The album switches gears with what seems like an obvious radio single, the Mellotron-laden \\"The Celestials,\\" which starts with a simple, infectious acoustic melody, and slowly builds and builds until it explodes into the fuzzed-out guitar bliss that's become the main signature of SP over the years (other than Billy's voice), one that's easily identifiable despite the many stylistic shifts this band has gone through over the years. There's no mistaking it, and it's as close to being \\"the perfect guitar tone\\" as I'm likely to ever hear. Nicole's breakdown in the middle of the song is another reminder that this album is the work an actual band, as I don't even remember hearing any bass guitar on SP's recent output, it's always so buried in the mix by walls of guitars and/or synths. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the \\"I will be special k\\" line in the chorus, however. Is he referring to the horse tranquilizer, or the cereal? And doeseither make sense?<br /><br />Either way, the despair-filled \\"Violet Rays\\" follows, and is one of my favorite songs on the album, but it suffers slightly from following such an insanely catchy track. Taken on its own, it's a classic SP ballad, with some tripped-out synthesizer effects thrown in for good measure, making it sound unique while still nodding to the band's past. The Zwan-esque, super-catchy \\"My Love is Winter\\" also contains some nice use of synth that transforms the simple, short song into something much more progressive and \\"epic\\" sounding. While the songs so far have used keyboard flourishes as background atmosphere, \\"One Diamond, One Heart\\" is dominated by it, with a propulsive beat and excellent, soul-stirring lyrics and vocals that slowly captivated me over time, along with another huge chorus that's nearly impossible for me to listen to without a big goofy grin taking over my face.<br /><br />The album begins to lose some steam for me during the next couple tracks. Normally I'm a huge fan of Corgan's epics, as they're usually the most overtly psychedelic songs on the albums (their psych tendencies being a key factor in turning me on to SP nearly 20 years ago), but both \\"Pinwheels\\" and the title track are somewhat meandering and never really seem to go anywhere. The latter begins to take flight near the end, but unfortunately it fades out (awkwardly) just as it's getting off the ground. Sometimes, however, the SP songs that don't immediately hit me are the ones that turn into my favorites down the road, but this one especially just feels like wasted potential to me.<br /><br />But things begin to look up again with the haunting, hypnotic \\"Pale Horse,\\" and \\"The Chimera,\\" another rocker that recalls the sunny days of Zwan.  \\"Glissandra\\" has a pretty standard, heavy-yet-dreamy sound that's become a Pumpkins staple, while \\"Inkless\\" reminds me of Built to Spill, in a good way, with a chugging, simple rhythm and guitar riff that's likely to stick in yourhead all night while trying to fall asleep, if you're anything like me. But I don't know if Doug Martsch ever got quite such a beautiful sound out of his guitar.  The quiet, somber \\"Wildflower\\" closes the album; an atmospheric, dreamy, perfect coda to an atmospheric, dreamy, nearly-perfect album.<br /><br />'Oceania,' while not a rehash of Corgan's short-lived Zwan project from a decade ago, does give me the same euphoric feeling I had while witnessing that band live during their formative months, with a similarly uplifting, \\"rejuvenated\\" sound that's both fuzzed-out and tripped-out at the same time. However, this is much more of a musical journey than Zwan's lone album was, with a variety of emotions and song-styles, not to mention more poetic, heartfelt lyrics that still maintain the positive vibe and energy throughout. The vocals are a lot lower in the mix than recent efforts as well, and, combined with the psychedelic overtones, allowed me to lose myself in the albums sonic bliss, which hasn't happened to me with any Corgan-related project since the Machina albums 12 years ago. It forges ahead into new musical territory for the band while still being instantly recognizable as The Smashing Pumpkins, and is an excellent start to this new chapter of the band's storied, ever-evolving history, much in the same way 'Gish' was a promising start for the original lineup. While it's not a flawless album, Billy Corgan now seems re-energized and ready to take on the world again, and for that, we should all be grateful.<br /><br />PS:  If you're still not digging this album after a few listens, just turn the volume up and see if that solves the problem!

B007VT6QSI|4.0|So a guy that listens or follows Justin Bieber's career garners a lot of grief, particularly after the `tongue-in-cheek' \\"Baby\\" took over, well EVERYTHING.  That was two years ago.  Now 18-year old Justin Bieber delivers [[ASIN:B007VT6QSI Believe [Deluxe Edition]]], a solid, more mature, pop effort.  On Believe, Bieber has evolved vocally in `leaps' and `bounds' debuting a much more mature and nuanced voice.  The songs still possess some corniness and schmaltz, but not to the extent of say \\"First Dance\\" from Bieber's [[ASIN:B002T921AC My World]].  Smartly, Bieber does not try to alienate his young fan base, using moderation and balance throughout Believe.<br /><br />\\"All Around The World\\" opens Believe solidly, if less satisfactorily than \\"Baby\\" opened [[ASIN:B0037AGASG My World 2.0]]. \\"All Around the World\\" plays into modern pop trends with its techno-infused, Europop influenced sound.  While Bieber shines if for no other reason than his `mature' voice, Ludacris's rap is ok, though not as potent as \\"Baby.\\"  \\"Boyfriend,\\" the ubiquitous first single, is superb, nodding to hip-hop and pop-soul given its use of acoustic guitar.  Brief, \\"Boyfriend\\" is a perfect single for both younger and older audiences, failing to alienate anyone like previous singles did.  While the songwriting is solid, newly `grown' Bieber has a childish moment with a clumsy `Buzz Lightyear' reference.  Aww shucks.<br /><br />Big Sean's addition on the fine \\"As Long As You Love Me\\" gives Bieber a further lift.  The dub-step production suits Bieber extremely well, right aligned with pop a la 2012.  The treatment of the refrain is a selling point, given Bieber's playful falsetto and gimmick play on the lyric \\"as long as you l-l-l-l love me...\\"  \\"Catching Feelings\\" delivers a sound pop-soul quality that reminds one of Justin Timberlake during his [[ASIN:B00006JO4Q Justified]] period (\\"Still on My Brain\\").  The use of acoustic guitars, a mainstay of Believe, help to reinforce the pop aspects of the  song.  The songwriting is impressive enough as well, particularly the refrain: \\"Could there be a possibility/I'm trying to see what's up/Cause I'm made for you, and you for me...I'm catching feelings, catching feelings...\\" As good as \\"Catching Feelings\\" is, Justin Bieber's second `Justin Timberlake' turn is better on \\"Take You,\\" where the stuttering drums and rhythmic acoustic guitar work well together.  Vocally, Bieber continues to shine, showing off his continually burgeoning, soulful pipes.  The refrain of \\"Take You\\" keeps things `fresh' by opting for a more dance-oriented vibe.<br /><br />\\"Right Here,\\" featuring Drake, is solid, though not `magical.'  The production is lush and spacey,  suiting Drake's emo-R&B style.  Not the complete package, \\"Right Here\\" has its moments, including catchy refrain and vocal ad libs by Bieber.  \\"Fall\\" resurrects acoustic guitar and the pop-soul edge established by \\"Catching Feelings\\" and \\"Take You.\\" The difference is \\"Fall\\" has more `pop' about it, contrasting more `urban' leaning cuts.  The main objection is there are too many layers of vocals during the refrain, making it hard to decipher the lyrics. \\"Die in Your Arms\\" is a `killer' cut.  Produced by Rodney \\"Darkchild\\" Jerkins and sampling \\"Synthetic Substitution,\\" \\"Die in Your Arms\\" is an overt contemporary R&B cut, showcasing Bieber's vocal runs, overall prowess, and nuances.  The cut G' rated,  save for `PG' lyric \\"...Loving you is so damn easy for me...\\" At least he was honest, right?<br /><br />\\"Thought of You\\" changes the pace with production from the soulful yearnings of \\"Die in Your Arms.\\" The cut finds Bieber ascending into his upper register supported by interesting production effects. \\"Beauty and a Beat\\" is clever, even given its corny play on `Beauty in the Beast' as far as the title is concerned.  Minaj adds a lift with her usual eccentricities while Max Martin delivers a solid, driving production.  Bieber handles the catchy chorus notably: \\"Cause all I need is a beauty and a beat/who can make my life complete/it's all `bout you/when the music makes you move/baby do it like you do...\\"<br /><br />\\"One Love\\" and \\"Be Alright\\" are OK, though don't standout against `beasts' like \\"Boyfriend,\\" or \\"Die in Your Arms.\\"  \\"Believe\\" closes the standard edition strongly enough, incorporating gospel-chorus into the obligatory inspirational cut. \\"Believe\\" pales in comparison to the best, but has its moments for sure.  The Deluxe edition's bonus cuts are enjoyable and would've been at home on the standard edition.  The most notable is \\"Maria,\\" which covers the topic of Bieber's speculated paternity.  The biggest quibble about the Michael Jackson-influenced cut - arguably the best of the effort bonus or not - is why it wasn't a standard edition track?<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B007VT6QSI Believe [Deluxe Edition]]] is an important album for Bieber's career.  It marks a huge step from being merely a `tween' artist to becoming an `artist' to all audiences.  Believe is one of the year's best pop album because it balances numerous styles and manages to present itself in a refined fashion.  Highly recommended.uty and a beat/who can make my life complete/it's all `bout you/when the music makes you move/baby do it like you do...\\"<br /><br />\\"One Love\\" and \\"Be Alright\\" are OK, though don't standout against `beasts' like \\"Boyfriend,\\" or \\"Die in Your Arms.\\"  \\"Believe\\" closes the standard edition strongly enough, incorporating gospel-chorus into the obligatory inspirational cut. \\"Believe\\" pales in comparison to the best, but has its moments for sure.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you thought the characters or plot in Twilight were too complicated, this is the perfect book for you.<br /><br />The main character is possibly the most unlikable person since Ignatius J. Reilly (I realize that reference will probably be over the heads of the target audience of this book.)<br /><br />If you read above a 10th grade level and are interested in reading erotica, do yourself a favor and buy a book of Penthouse Letters.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|**SPOILER ALERT, DO NOT READ IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO KNOW DETAILS OF THE 3 BOOKS**<br />I love to read and was looking for a new book to get in to.  Some of my co workers told me about the first book so I downloaded it to my Kindle.  I must say the first one was good and I was so excited to read the next two.  Two chapters into book 2 and I was board to tears. Ana is the most annoying character from book to 2 to the end of 3.  She is so predictable and spineless.  Christian is an abusive, controlling, stalker and I do not know how any woman in real life or fiction can find him appealing.  He buys her place of employment to control her, he buys her a car but refuses to let her drive to \\"keep her safe\\" and she has security with her at all times so that he knows her every waking move. God forbid she goes to have a drink with a friend he flies home to confront her.  I know this book is targeted to 30-something year old wives and mothers but as a 34 year old wife and mother I thought the story was the most stupid, unrealistic BS I have ever read.  The sex was redundant.  All they did was have sex all the time, everywhere and they always climax at the same time right on cue. Ana is so boring and needy. In real life a man as powerful and beautiful as Christian Grey would have dropped her like a bad habit but here he falls for her.  SAVE YOUR MONEY. These books are booooring to the point where you feel like you are reading a text book from your least favorite college course. I only read all 3 because I bought them and did not want to just waste money.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|This is nothing short of a very Triumphant & Triumphful Return of Scottish Rocker, Shirley Manson & Garbage (Butch Vig, Duke, & Steve), after 7 years, since the release of \\"Bleed Like Me\\". I love this great new album. The Deluxe Edition is the best option, because you get additional tracks.  This new album \\"Not Your Kind of People\\", is a great mix of \\"Pop\\" & \\"Rock\\". It really shows how Shirley & the band have matured as recording artists together. If you liked \\"Garbage\\" their debut album from the 1990's, \\"Beautiful Garbage\\", & \\"Bleed Like Me\\", then you should really enjoy this great new release. It's \\"Pop\\" & it's \\"Rock\\" all in one album. I love it, and I highly recommend it. Thanks!!!!!
B00001OH7P|5.0|There are many good rock albums from the Stones and the Beatles but this David Bowie album has got to be among that group.  Every song is well written, played and sung.  Even after listening to this album countless times since 1972, I still get goose bumps listening to it even today.  My kids were concepts when I first listened to this album but even they agree that this is a great album.  If you have not heard it, it is new to you.  Do yourself  a big favor this year, buy this album, sit down with a glass of good wine and as the album cover says: play it at Max. Volume. You will not regret it!!

B0007MAJBQ|5.0|I can't believe how time flies... I bought my MD Recorder about 10-11 year ago. I used it predominantly for my video and audio projects in College for multimedia. Though, the MD-Recorder found a home in my closet along with some other equipment for a roughly 5-6 years. Now, I use it on a regular basis.<br /><br /> Mini-Discs are an invaluable tool in my opinion, but technology has changed vastly in the last 4-6 years. Media in general has expanded its capabilities to larger memory and accessibility, doing away with MD discs.<br /><br />I still enjoy the novelty and useability of my MD-Recorder and Discs. But... Now a days, digital recorders are the way to go, and they have much better built in microphones. MD Recorders lack any built in microphones...<br /><br />Though, you could adapt a condensor or omni-directional mics to the MD Recorder. Again, regardless to the changes with current technologies (2012), I still enjoy using my MD Recorder!

B00004W510|3.0|The CD was fine--sound quality good, no scratches, or other problems. But, the internal labeling of songs was completely wrong.  The song titles were all from an Andrew Lloyd Weber collection (Phantom of the Opera). The music itself was by The Band but there is no way to select a particular track and know which Band song will actually play.  Irritating, to say the least.
B004LROMQG|5.0|This is one of the few shows that I cannot stop watching! It's absolutely amazing! The plots are never repetitive. Of course, one can see who lives and who dies at the end of each episode, but along the way, there's always something shocking. The series definitely got a little bit darker, and even better than before! I cannot recommend this TV show enough. Every character is well written. I only wish that it was still shown on NBC. Now I'll have to wait for almost a year until it comes out in the states.
B000HA9L9O|5.0|This is the reason Joss Whedon will forever be known as one of Television's greatest creative minds.

B002361MLA|3.0|The main idea is simple, and definitely effective. I know I live in my mind a lot. Past mistakes effect me for a long time. And suffer from the thinking that when I do this then I will feel successful.<br /><br />Deep down I always knew that you have to live in the present. Smell the roses. But it is not easy for me to do.<br /><br />So I got this book because I thought it will convince me to enjoy NOW. I agree with the author's main message that you have to live in the present moment. He suggests various exercises to stop your mind from drifting into future worries or past regrets.<br /><br />However, the author uses a lot of new age mumbo jumbo. Book is full of pseudo-science. There is a lot of stereotyping especially how males and females behave. And of course there are no links or references to any of the claims that the authors makes. For example, the author says that marriages/love relationships are at their worst in today's world. But there is no reference to any study or research.<br /><br />I would say sure read this book and take the good parts. Maybe borrow it from your library and read the first half.

1595828753|3.0|Avatar: The Last Airbender - The Promise, Part 2, picks up right where Part 1 ended. Toph returns to her students and Sokka tags along with her, Zuko is still trying to get information from his father, and Katara and Aang go to the Earth King to try to set up a meeting. However, things don't go as planned for any of them.<br /><br />I love the fact that we get more Avatar. It's almost like the show is still going on, which is awesome since it's one of my favourites. Even better since Korra is on and this kinda ties everything in together. And some mysteries are being solved as well.<br /><br />What I don't like is the fact that these are way too short. Way way too short. If this is about as long as they're be, all three promise parts could have been combined into one longer comic instead of three too short ones. Since they did it in short comics, I'm almost wondering if they just wanted to make the money more than show the story for fans. :\<br /><br />Also, this one didn't stick too much to the original story. Yes, it did have its moments, but it seemed more focused on Tokka moments than anything else. Which I'm not complaining about since I love me some Tokka. (And Zutara, but doubt that'll happen in the comics. :()<br /><br />I still love this comic and I've purchased every Avatar comics so far, so I'll still get the next one, no matter what. But I would love it if they would add more detail and more info into the comic itself. If you already have the first one, I say go ahead and buy this one. If you're unsure, see about getting it from the library. Or even read it at a book store. It doesn't take long to finish, like five minutes.

Hope you like this.<br /><br />.............As a pro trader living in HK a city well known for its free trade policy and in close proxmity to ............, I can tell this book really blow my mind. The author, with his excellent organisation and writing skills, had enlightened me of some great stuff from something which I had encountered daily and accepted casually yet without giving serious enough thinking about. IMHO, no matter how knowledgeable you are of politics and economics, I truly believe that one can learn something from this book. A must read for all. Highly recommended!<br /><br />p.s. Below please find my favorite passages for your reference.<br />In 1819 new legislation was tabled in the British Parliament. It would ban the employment of young children (under 9). Older Children (10-16) would still be restricted to 12 hours per day....Some members of the House of Lords objected to it on the ground that \\"labour ought to be free\\". Pg2<br />In 1905, US was a country in which the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional a New York state law limiting the working days of bakers to ten hours, on the grounds that it deprived the baker of the liberty of working as long as he wished. Pg7<br />In the 1960s, the LG Group was banned by the government from entering its desired textile industry and was forced to enter the electric cable industry.....In the 1970s, the Korean Government put enormous pressure on the founder of the Hyundai Group to start a ship building company. The then dictator personally threatened the Group with bankruptcy. Pg129<br />What really distinguishes the rich countries from the poorer ones is much less how well educated their individual citizens are than how well their citizens are organized into collective entities with high productivity - be that giant firms such as Boeing or Volkswagen or the small world class firms of Switzerland and Italy. Development of such firms needs to be supported by a range of institutions that encourage investment and risk taking - a trade regime that protects and nurtures firms in infant industries, a financial system that provides patient capital necessary for long term productivity enhancing investments, institutions that provide second chances for both the capitalists (a good bankruptcy law) and for the workers (a good welfare state), public subsidies and regulation regarding R&D and training, and so on. Education is valuable, but its main value is not in raising productivity. It lies in its ability to help us develop our potentials and live a more fulfilling and independent life. If we expanded education in the belief that it will make our economies richer, we will be sorely disappointed.

0807014273|5.0|The book starts with the author's experience in various concentration camps. I'd never read a book about that, so I was interested to see how he would describe his experiences. In the next part, he talks about his psychiatric method Logotherapy which is a very interesting subject itself.<br /><br />Honestly, it wasn't so much the experiences he talked about that made me stop and think; not the inhumanity, or the excessive strain the camp victims were put under. It was his view and analysis of the circumstances he and his camp mates found themselves in which made me put the book down on more than one occasion and to think deeply about what he had to say. This happened constantly throughout the book, and it made me reflect on the suffering that I have gone through throughout my lifetime.<br /><br />As a final note, there is a part in the book where he talks about paradoxical intention. I have found it to be a great way to break the old habit of freezing up in the urinal when another person is standing next to me. I've also used it with great success in helping me fall asleep when I start to worry that I'm not going to be able to fall asleep.<br /><br />Man's Search for Meaning is certainly a book worth reading by everyone, and especially by people who have undergone an incredible amount of suffering in their lifetimes.

B002IFT1ZA|5.0|Game of Thrones, is an immaculate and tricky story about multiple characters as they are thrown in various scenarios to deal with. This first sentence must sound odd, but in truth, the story is odd for there is no hero, and there is no ultimate hero. If this doesn't appeal to you then obviously don't buy it. If however, you enjoy puzzles, then this is your type of show with an amazing cast, and splendid directing. As a bookworm myself, I chose to read all five books while waiting for this to come out on dvd and was not surprised by the certain cuts, and additions made to the series. I was not appalled by the nudity or the fighting.<br /><br />In short I cannot express my enthusiasm and love for this show, I cannot wait for season 2 and I really look forward to book 6!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love  this game.  it totally gets my mind off off the days work.  it fun and entertaining to the kids.v

B003UBTX7C|5.0|David Baldacci has written another of his great \\"Camel's Club\\" novels.  This book kept you interested page after page.  Just a great read!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games don't tell you how to play them. they are easy to figure out but they should still be there
B007SGM084|1.0|I feel like I was misled with the two sample chapters that were no indication of how pornographic the book is. I wish that I could return it.This book is disgusting and should not be sold by Amazon.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed the book and did find it was quite a page-turner.  However, I didn't think it had a lot to say about relationships except the relationship between these two creative and warped souls.  It did, however, have some great suspense and gotcha moments that kept me swimming quickly through the book.  I agree with many others that the ending wasn't satisfying.  Still, it is a great way to lose yourself for a few hours on a lazy day or two.  Recommended.
030758836X|3.0|I loved Gillian Flynn's other two books and was SO excited that she released another. I loved the writing and the easy dialog. I wasn't however a huge fan of the story, especially the ending. I would still recommend it for people who love a mystery and something unexpected but I would not say this is my favorite of hers. Sharp Objects is still my favorite of Ms. Flynn's novels.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is addictinng ad fun fun fun fun tu. fun ti.f is J's is os is is is is is fun fun fun fun fun ok the best
B007SGM084|2.0|I read the first book and thought it was okay - the phrases were so repetitive that I found myself skipping sections. I became so tired of reading 'later babys' 'rolling eyes'  etc... that I gave up reading the triology midway on book 2. The lack of original wording or phrases to describe events took away from the thin story line. I'm sure some people will enjoy it but it wasn't my cup of tea. The sex scene didn't bother me but reading the same one over and over and over again described basically the same way was boring.
B0086700CM|5.0|its awesome as simple as that. you see how everyone gives it a 5star? its because its awesome!!!!! just get it
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game..it took me awhile to figure it out but once you get the hang of it you won't want to put your device down.
0345803485|1.0|This book is not only boring and I have given this book such a low rating for the following reasons.<br /><br />#1 Juvenile Writing at Best<br />From a literary standpoint, this book is poorly written. I understand it is commercial literature. No, I am not expecting symbolism and deep messages to lie within the words of the book. However, I am expecting the writing to sound like that of an adult. As mentioned above, it is juvenile writing at best.<br /><br />Repetition: James' repetition of certain words and phrases is irritating. So irritating, that I will not list the words she uses repeatedly in this book review in fear of torturing myself once again with juvenility of her writing. I need no reminders.<br /><br />#2 Too Unrealistic<br />In novels certain happenings can seem a little coincidental for what we call \\"real life.\\" Sometimes characters may be uncommon in the real world. But that's okay. Depending on the storyline, it can actually make very good fiction because it heightens one's level of interest.<br /><br />There is, however, a limit to how much an author can use these techniques. When used too much, as James does in this book, the storyline is no longer one with occasional rare scenarios, but instead a tale, overflowing with unrealistic events.<br />Christian Grey's massive wealth is contradictory to the fact that we hardly ever actually see him working, expect for a brief stint more than halfway through the book. This brief period seems forced into the story, as if James realized more than halfway into the story that this man who supposedly built his own wealth is hardly ever working. It just didn't flow.<br /><br />#3 Erotic?<br />James' limited vocabulary comes into play again with regards to the sex scenes. She appears to be scared of the word vagina. \\"Down there,\\" is not a term is expect to find in a book being advertised as erotic literature. What is Ana talking about her toes?<br /><br />I have never read erotic literature where it takes twentyfive chapters for a woman to have oral sex performed on her. I am personally not a huge fan of erotic literature (if you read my book reviews you will see that), however, I am no rookie to the genre either. I have certainly read better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love how you have to work to get games so you're never bored!!! I play this game with my whole family and we all get into it!
B00138H94S|5.0|Sandanista! is difficult to review. It contains some of the best songs The Clash recorded, and undoubtedly the worst. I won't recap all that has been said before, but suffice it to know, I owned this album the day it came out, and by the end of the week, I had distilled it onto an 8-track tape into one of the best double album I owned, and perhaps ever will.<br /><br />But yeah, it is a triple album. I removed a lot what I felt were the almost unlistenable excess.<br /><br />But songs like<br /><br />The Magnificent Seven<br />Somebody Got Murdered<br />Rebel Waltz<br />Lightning Strikes (Not Once but Twice)<br />Let's Go Crazy<br />The Sound of Sinners<br />Police on My Back<br />The Call Up<br />Washington Bullets<br />Charlie Don't Surf<br />The Street Parade<br /><br />That is some of the greatest contemporary songs ever recorded. Yeah, there is a lot of filler. But still Sandanista! is a definite 5 star album.<br /><br />Get it. It is essential.
0679731725|4.0|You've got to hand it to Ishiguro. What a storyteller. Stevens, the narrator here, is a frigid and pompous English butler whose chief interests appear to be polishing silverware and blind loyalty to an unsavoury, reactionary boss. Yet by the end of the book it's impossible not to feel sympathy, even affection, for this emotionally constipated old bugger whose obsession with dignity and duty has brought him only loneliness and regrets.
0345803485|5.0|This book was impossible to put down!!  I will read this book more than once.  I have also purchased more from Amazon as gifts.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|I bought this for our twin grandchildren. They absolutely love it! I have to show them the end about 10 times after it ends.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is just mediocre porn for frustrated and not highly educated housewives!  Unbelievable characters, poorly written, and no real redeeming value to it at all.  Don't waste your time or your money on this trash!
B00356CO1E|5.0|LOVE this workout!!<br /><br />Good for couch potatoes to those already in decent condition, BUT, you have to know how to work it.  This does not come with any gimmicks, so if you're one who just likes to go through the motions, this workout won't work for you.  This is a simple, well-planned, traditional, kick-your-butt or give-it-up workout.<br /><br />I have a BA in Education and I'm currently a stay-at-home mom, so, I am not an expert, but I know a little something about exercise science.  That's important for this workout, because you're doing it at home, by yourself.  To get the most out of it, you need to understand what muscle groups you're working and push yourself to put pressure on them during the various moves.  You also need to understand and be honset about how much you need to push your body to challenge it during cardio.  This workout is easy to cheat, but then why bother!!  Push through and you will get results.  One of the best, most balanced workouts I've ever tried!!<br /><br />My story: I'm about 30 lbs. overweight, size 10, almost a couch potato, active with my kids at the pool, park, etc., but I havn't worked out regularly for over a year.  I use this workout 4-5 days in a row, then take a \\"weekend\\" break which includes swimming or playing with my kids, or a gentle yoga workout.  The first day, I couldn't quite finish Level 1.  I thought my program might turn into a 60 day shred!  BUT, by day 3 I was finishing everything!  And by week 2, I was pushing more and knew I could push through the 3 levels in 30 days.  I'll check back in a month to let you know what kind of results I get.  (Remember, it's much easier to lose weight/inches when you're already over your healthy weight.)<br /><br />I really like the versatility of this workout.  There's a beginners track with \\"Anita;\\" that's the track I'm following; and a challenging track with \\"Natalie.\\"  If you've already been working out and are in decent shape, you should definitely jump right in with Natalie, or this will be too easy.  My plan now is to get through the 3 levels with \\"Anita,\\" then start the program again next month and try to keep up with \\"Natalie.\\"  With these two options, you really have a long-term workout routine that can continue to challenge you if you use it properly.<br /><br />Finally, I really like the vibe of this workout.  Jillian is not too perky, or too tough/intimidating, both of which get on my nerves with a workout video.<br /><br />Anyone who knows how to set personal goals, and doesn't need a babysitter to help them achieve those goals, will improve their fitness with this program.  And will save hundreds of dollars (a big factor for me right now) and hours of time on gyms, trainers, or classes.  These can be fun, and have a nice social benefit, but face it: if you're going to get in shape, no one can do it but you.  Jillian just lays it out for you so you know what you need to do each day.
B007R0Y7VO|4.0|This is a great family movie (go figure, Steven Spielberg) but I would caution against showing to younger kids because of the war scenes, which are very stark but could be used as a teaching tool about war. Moving and inspirational. Amazon's digital delivery of streaming movies is great (our family uses it frequently for Family Movie Night) so I don't blame them for TWC's wanting to throttle (their competition) by making the movie go into load/buffering.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I grabbed this as the faotd cause i like golf games. Its not knockout graphics but the use of powr upz is almost like club selection, it matters to yr score drastically if u use them correctly. Hooked on it, thx :)
B007SGM084|5.0|I never liked to read when I HAD to -such as school assignments- but now I get to read what I WANT to and yes I WANT to read more!  I have recommended this trilogy to all my friends and anyone is see who reads on this level.  Thanks Amazon for having it for my Kindle and thanks E L James for putting your words on paper- so to speak !
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This series of books is light entertainment with an adult vein to it. Once I started to read the book, I had to finish the series, as that is the kind of person I am. The writing is simplistic, and there isn't much of a story outside of the main plot. Usually the books I read have more stories woven together with other people, what they are doing etc. This is mainly just her.<br />If you are looking for great literature, do not pick it up. If you want some titillating light reading, this might be for you!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was initially a little disturbing in content but have to say, difficult to put down.  I completed all 3 books within 5 days because I just had to know what was going to happen next.  Once you come to grips with your own discomfort you realize the story line is not about the sexual content, rather, in my humble opinion, it is about life experiences that bring us to the point we are at in our lives and how we have come to deal with those experiences/coping if you will.  What and how we think and behave is a direct result of those life experiences and we learn how to cope in various ways to either succeed or sucumb.  That said, we also have people enter our lives which can either make or break who we are to make us either worse or better than we are and get to the next point.  It is an interesting love story filled with twists and turns that keep you wanting to find out more.  Very enjoyable fantasy get away from daily life.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I watched the first series on Netflix and just couldn't wait for the next so I bought the DVD!! i It's a true classic....I shall also purchase the first series so I have the complete story. Love it!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was really, really disappointed in this book. The story could have been interesting but it really falls flat with predictable and non believeable characters. The writing is lacking creativity. It is basically a book about a form of sex and thats about it. There is really no interesting plot lines like a exit to eden type of book and it really didn't do anything for me.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|***This review contains spoilers***<br /><br />I have to admit that I hadn't seen any Wes Anderson films until two or three years ago and Moonrise Kingdom is the first that I have had the pleasure of seeing in the theater.<br /><br />My first Anderson experience was Bottle Rocket, and it didn't strike me as remarkable the first time I saw it. However, I found myself thinking about it over the next few days and ended up buying the Criterion Blu-ray.<br /><br />I think there are a couple of important things to understand about Anderson's films:<br /><br />The first is the level of detail. It's an assault on the brain and I've come to appreciate subsequent viewings more than with most films. Many lesser comedies fall flat because they run out of ideas and end up repeating them until they approach 90 minutes. Anderson's films have so many ideas it's ridiculous, but five of his seven films are also over by the 94-minute mark. The difference is that they are crammed with ideas and feel fresh and original.<br /><br />The other major thing to note is the brand of humor. Call it offbeat or quirky, or whatever you like, but it's certainly distinctive. It's the type of humor that uses a phrase or situation which is familiar to you, but surprises you by giving it a different meaning. Think of Police Squad, Naked Gun, or Monty Python, and you'll understand what I mean. Like David Lynch, I think Anderson's mind makes unusual connections that most are incapable of. In order to appreciate his films, you need to investigate all of his worlds and understand the way that he thinks. It might be too much work for the casual viewer.<br /><br />Let's get to Moonrise Kingdom.<br /><br />The film is set in the 1960s on a small island off New England. It evokes a sense of nostalgia that's present throughout. This is a time in which cell phones and most electronic entertainment didn't exist. Take a look at the primitive record player for example. The story focuses on the budding romance between Sam (Gilman) and Suzy (Hayward). Sam is a scout and invites Suzy to run away with him, causing the small town to send out a search party.<br /><br />The supporting cast includes some big names and a few Anderson favorites. The local cop is played by Bruce Willis and he's particularly effective in the role. The Scout Master is played by Edward Norton, who has an exaggerated sense of his own importance. He provides a lot of the humor in the few scenes he is in. Look out for the homage to The Shawshank Redemption when he discovers that Sam is missing.<br /><br />Frances McDormand and Bill Murray play a married couple and both are lawyers. Jason Schwartzman's appearance is brief, but he makes good use of the time. One of my favorite characters is played by Tilda Swinton, and she is simply referred to as Social Services. Even Bob Balaban's narration is funny. It's hard to go into any more detail without ruining the entire plot, such as it is, so I'll stop there.<br /><br />I mentioned that Anderson's films require several viewings to take in all the details, but I have to say that Moonrise Kingdom had an immediate impact on me. This is my style of humor and it felt like a Coen brothers movie, such as Burn After Reading, at times. Nothing much happens, but it's the style that's important. If you like Anderson's other films, you will almost certainly appreciate this.<br /><br />I sometimes wonder what kind of childhood Anderson had. Are these characters based on his own experiences? Most are intelligent and suffered something of a troubled upbringing. When I think of Sam, or Max (from Rushmore), am I seeing the way Anderson views his own early life? Dysfunctional families are a favorite topic of his and Moonrise Kingdom is filled with them. Perhaps I had such an immediate connection to the film because it felt familiar after seeing his other work?<br /><br />I'll close by saying that Anderson's films won't have universal or even large appeal, but if you appreciate his quirky style, you might just end up loving everything he does. I know that's true for me. I'll always remember that I first watched the film on my 50th birthday with two friends I have known since I was 11. That was a great experience and I would like to watch Moonrise Kingdom again right now.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5 (with the potential to rise to 5/5 after repeat viewings).uirky style, you might just end up loving everything he does. I know that's true for me. I'll always remember that I first watched the film on my 50th birthday with two friends I have known since I was 11. That was a great experience and I would like to watch Moonrise Kingdom again right now.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5 (with the potential to rise to 5/5 after repeat viewings).
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|I saw this film despite the mixed reviews and I thought it was OK. It wasn't the epic I was expecting or that was advertised. The movie was visually fantastic. For sure you see they wanted you to know that this was set in the Alien universe, but don't go in expecting Alien. I think Ridley Scott and Co. were better off not mentioning Alien at all. This would've quelled the criticism the movie got because now people have an expectation that may not have been intended. If people weren't given hints of the connection, it would've given a surprise that was unexpected but also more open minds looking at this as it's own thing. This brought the quality down for me because my head was filled with too much information beforehand. Now you have no choice but to look for something else you weren't meant to be looking for. That made this kind of predictable. I knew mostly everyone was going to die. And a lot if it felt forced. I did not have a problem understanding the story. I wasn't confused like dome said they were. Questions were left unanswered on purpose. The problem for me is I don't want to return for them. The movie was OK for a look but in the end, it just wasn't what it could've or should've been.
B007KCG7MQ|4.0|I like this C.D. But, The Audio Quality of \\"Analog Man\\", \\"Wreaking Ball\\", \\"Lucky That Way\\" and \\"Spanish Dancer\\" sound Flat/Uneven. Unfortunately, I think Jeff Lynne Dropped The Ball. What were you thinking Jeff??? Another issue for me is the Synthesizer Instead of Lead Guitar on \\"Analog Man\\". HUH?? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT??? The Video/Live versions of the 1st 3 tracks are So Much Better. If only the Audio from the D.V.D. Versions were on the C.D. It would have been a More Enjoyable Listen in my opinion. But, It's still worthy of 4 Stars because it's JOE WALSH!!!!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I chew through books, but very rarely do I find a book that is so astoundingly bad that I feel compelled to review it. This book was so dreadful that I found myself dazed and confused about how this thing a. was published, and b. made it to the top of the NY Times Bestseller list.<br /><br />*First and foremost, Anastasia Steel is an almost entirely vacant character. She seems to have no qualities that are uniquely her own and those characteristics she does maintain are flimsy and unremarkable. Essentially, this gives the book the feel of a middle of the road (closer to bad) fanfiction with Ana serving as the portal through which one can imagine herself as part of her favorite universe. Ana's quirks are so unlikely and ridiculous that her character composition feels just wrong, and for a literature major with a love of classics, the only book she has apparently ever read is Tess of the d'Urbervilles. Ms. James tries to rectify this in the rest of the trilogy, but the lit. references are so clumsy they are almost sad. The only motivations the reader has for finishing this story are to get to the bottom of Christian Grey, who is apparently so enigmatic and \\"mercurial\\" that Ms. James felt compelled to use the word until it has lost all meaning, and for the much alluded to explicit sexuality. Mr. 50 Shades himself is not really a mystery, and once his issues are aired, it's easy to see that he's the hurt-comfort carrot of the book, served up to readers in a poorly articulated effort to winkle out at least some emotive connection to the characters.<br /><br />*The inclusion of a BDSM lifestyle was possibly the most intriguing part about the piece, if only for how poorly the book represented the concept. BDSM predilections are portrayed in an almost exclusively negative light, but Ms. James repeatedly seems to justify and alternately bash the lifestyle to the ultimate confusion of the reader.<br /><br />*The writing is atrocious! I wish I didn't have to say this, becausethere were some endearing portions, but the overall composition was so childish that rather than engaging with the world of these characters, I was constantly boosted out of the 50 Shades universe because of the prose itself. The reasons for this were two-fold: 1. There was a major discrepancy between the dialogue of the characters and what, as an American living in the Pacific NW (the supposed setting of the book), I identify as \\"normal\\" speech patterns. I think that this has to do with Ms. James' possible lack of familiarity/comfort with a dialect not her own. It constantly broke the 4th wall so to speak, and made reading the book uncomfortable. 2. There was a limited vocabulary used throughout the book when it came to character descriptions and actions. Rather than create a signature for each character, the descriptions were overused and held little meaning. I was constantly reminded of what you learn in basic high school lit about showing rather than telling... The sex scenes alone are downright silly and considering that this is the major attraction, it's just shameful! I'm all for a good and graphic romp here and there, but it has to be GOOD and actually contribute something to the story!!<br /><br />*WTF moments were all over the place!!! There are so many moments in this book, and in the series at large, where you just stop and say \\"Huh?\\" Ana's internal convos are a perfect example of this. They pop up out of NOWHERE and lets get some semantics straight, subconscious is just that, beneath the aware consciousness! The nonsense about Ana having debates with her subconscious was ludicrous. And \\"inner goddess,\\" are you kidding me?? Internal dialogue is great, but give us some context for cryin out loud...<br /><br />Overall, there is nothing that is truly compelling in this book, urging the reader to finish it or go on to the next 2 books in the series. I was so disappointed because I honestly wanted to like it, E.L. James came out of the woodwork and I think it's great when unknowns come out as champs in today's publishing world, but this was undeserving of the hype. I cannot understand the publicity and readership that this book has gained... I've heard it said elsewhere and I'll say it here too, just because they published it, doesn't mean you have to read it, and in the case of the Fifty Shades series, it's not worth your while.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I give it 5 stars!! I didn't like the ending, but thanks goodness it's a trilogy! It's a must read.
0345803485|5.0|Simply put, I enjoyed the book.  I am very much into the Kink community and very knowledgeable about BDSM.  I was also once a plain Vanilla girl.  I have seen the Vanilla housewives go crazy over this book and seen the Kink community call it an insipid useless piece of garbage.  My opinion is this. It is a romance novel about two people entering into the world of BDSM together, and their own private journey.  The only part I found really boring and overdone, was the part with the contracts.  It shows that clearly the Grey character knew nothing about a true BDSM contract, and therefore it is probable that the author did very little research about this, other than to find one online someplace.  In the kink community, it is not safe nor sane to ask someone to agree to allow things they don't understand or have not experienced.  How would one know what \\"limits\\" are, if they have never been whipped or spanked?  It was a silly error, but certainly did not water down the story for me.  I started a chat group about these books and we have had SO many different opinions expressed, much as those differ here in the reviews.<br /><br />It is a lovely romance.  Book One left me hungry to read book two, which I am halfway through.  The humor scattered throughout has literally made me laugh out loud.  But I am not laughing at the author, I am laughing with the characters. I have enjoyed their journey, I think it is probably very much like many peoples journey into BDSM, you try things, you get passionate about some, cry over others and vow never to do them again.  When Anastasia left at the end of book one, it was VERY probable that things could have gone that way.  For many newcomers into BDSM, they step into the pool and then find the waters too dark and deep for them, and they go running back to the solace of dry firm ground.  Many of them go back again and try for a second dip...then begin wading, then go for the swim.  Pretty soon those that love BDSM find themselves diving off the high dive into the darker, edgier play.  If you had told me 15 years ago that I would be not only doing, but teaching people how to do CBT (cock and ball torture) on men, I would have laughed in your face.  Now, there I am on the high dive of BDSM and enjoying every second of it. It is a life choice for me, just as it is for Mr Grey.  But what some don't realize is that for MANY players and especially those with money and position in life, they can NOT venture out into public dungeons because they simply cannot risk losing their businesses or family connections, to get their kink on.  The sad thing is that for many of those people, they have no venue's for learning how to truly grow in BDSM and so they make a lot of mistakes that cause both physical, but probably mainly emotional distress to their partners.  This is what I see happening with the characters of 50 Shades.  Sure he knows how to use what he buys, but he has no true mentors (except for his Mrs. Robinson, who in real life, would have had as much to lose as he, so it would be like the blind leading the blind), his growth and the growth of his partner(s) will grow, but be limited by what they experience along the way and how they manage to muddle through it.<br /><br />I am greatly enjoying these books, they are a fun and entertaining read, but I do not believe that it was the authors intention for anyone to use her stories as a guideline for what to do with your private life. This is not BDSM 101, it is not meant to teach or help you with your growth in kink.  What a huge responsibility that would be for a romance writer!!  But for someone like myself, who has a deeply romantic side, as well as a deeply kinky side, this book is the best of both worlds!  I have defended it against my community for it's lack of \\"responsibility\\" and defended it with the vanilla's for the \\"sick and twisted\\" mind of Mr Grey.  People want what they want, and will always find a way to get it.  Some are more dark in theirdesires than others are.  Let me end this by sharing something with you.<br /><br />Many years ago, I was teaching a class in BDSM, in Jamaica (where BDSM is illegal, but it was a private swingers resort).  I had my partner dressed as most of the men attending the class and had him sit towards the back, with the crowd.  I, on the other hand, was dressed in high fetish.  I asked the crowd if any of them could find my partner - they had seen us together for three days, and the resort was not that big.  Nobody recognized him.  As I slowly made my way to the back of the class, holding a collar and leash, I told them that this is what they see every day.  Your neighbors, co-workers and family, into kink, fetish, BDSM, however you need to label it, look just like you do every day. Most are very private about it and never discuss it and you would never find them in a crowd.  I stopped near my partner and asked him to strip.  He stood, stripped down to his g-string, and then I put the collar and leash on him.  Suddenly everyone recognized him and felt pretty silly that they did not know who he was, as for three days, many of them had been making comments about the man on the leash.  Here he was, so ready to strip in front of a crowded room at my command.  By the end of that class...I had several couples come up to me and tell me that they loved being able to see kink from the point of view from someone involved - someone who knew what the hell they were talking about.  All of the classes for the rest of that week were filled to standing capacity. Light bulbs went on for many of the swingers (many of you would not know that swingers and BDSM crowds differ greatly and usually are highly critical of each other - pretty silly, huh?).

Let me end this by sharing something with you.<br /><br />Many years ago, I was teaching a class in BDSM, in Jamaica (where BDSM is illegal, but it was a private swingers resort).  I had my partner dressed as most of the men attending the class and had him sit towards the back, with the crowd.  I, on the other hand, was dressed in high fetish.  I asked the crowd if any of them could find my partner - they had seen us together for three days, and the resort was not that big.  Nobody recognized him.  As I slowly made my way to the back of the class, holding a collar and leash, I told them that this is what they see every day.  Your neighbors, co-workers and family, into kink, fetish, BDSM, however you need to label it, look just like you do every day. Most are very private about it and never discuss it and you would never find them in a crowd.  I stopped near my partner and asked him to strip.  He stood, stripped down to his g-string, and then I put the collar and leash on him.  Suddenly everyone recognized him and felt pretty silly that they did not know who he was, as for three days, many of them had been making comments about the man on the leash.  Here he was, so ready to strip in front of a crowded room at my command.  By the end of that class...I had several couples come up to me and tell me that they loved being able to see kink from the point of view from someone involved - someone who knew what the hell they were talking about.  All of the classes for the rest of that week were filled to standing capacity. Light bulbs went on for many of the swingers (many of you would not know that swingers and BDSM crowds differ greatly and usually are highly critical of each other - pretty silly, huh?).  The line between that group of swingers and the BDSM crowd, became lighter that week and many of them told me that they fully intended to learn more when they got home and asked me for references on where they could learn.  It was extremely rewarding.<br /><br />Hopefully these books will continue to open dialogue between the vanilla world (if you read the book you know what that means!) and the wonderful world of Kink.

B004XXIHS2|5.0|I am so glad that I listened to the reviews! This was a great read - kept me up late and got me up early to read!  Even read it at the gym on the treadmill!  I sincerely enjoyed reading this!  Everyone else has said what it's about...so I won't.  But the style and setup were wonderful.  I look forward to more like this!<br />And I really enjoy Stephen King - which this is NOT!  Just a good suspensful read!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|This book was very insightful on how we form and change habits.  It looks at habits on a wide range of scales (Personal, Company, Society).  It is somewhat bland at times, but is definitely worth the read.
B007TBCTRK|1.0|I'm sure at some point this music had some good sound quality... no more.<br />The release is flawed by poor sound quality due to a inferior cheap pressing.<br /><br />Zero stars...
B007I2BZIE|3.0|I never cease to be amazed at the hype that can surround any given object or thing....even music!  Let's get one thing straight Rush has proven themselves to be outstanding musicians.  And, like any band have had ups and downs in their career.  Like any artist who paints a canvas musicians do the same only with instruments rather than a brush.  Hence, Rush created several masterpieces years ago with, \\"2112\\", \\"Fly By Night\\" and \\"A Farewell To Kings.\\"  I think you could even throw in \\"Moving Pictures\\" and \\"Signals.\\"  Each of the titles stated were progressions of the bands growth and vision.  Sadly, there comes a time when growth and vision become either stunted and or lost completely.<br /><br />For myself the truly last enjoyable release from Rush was \\"Power Windows.\\"  Pretty much everything since has been spotty at best.  \\"Roll The Bones\\" offered a bit of promise but overall still lacked that RUSH sound we fell in love with.  And perhaps their in lies the problem.  When you expect something to sound as good or LIKE the past you set yourself up for disappointment.<br /><br />The true musician views himself just like that painter stated earlier....they want to progress and that means change.  Change can be good.  It can stimulate and motivate.  It can also cloud the mind and create division.<br /><br />So now we have the first offering from one of the worlds premier bands in 5 years.  I thought it would never happen but it has.  Suffice it to say that this in not a masterpiece.  It is technically flawless.  I've never heard RUSH as tight as they are on this recording.  So all is well there.  Where there seems to be a flaw is in the creative end of things.  That's not to say \\"Clockwork Angels\\" is a total bust because it is not.  There are several tracks that capture my attention.  Problem is I lose that attention span trying to listen to what is really a concept album (pardon me my age is showing) CD.<br /><br />It would appear, on the surface, that Rush is trying to recapture that old glory from their earlier success.  Try as they might it falls short due to trying rather than going with their emotion(s).  The creation of the concept is sort of interesting but, where it fails lies in the inability to reach down to their gut and pull it out by the boot straps and get you thumping along with the flow of the music.  Like I said, technically Rush has never sounded as good.  It's that I fail to be inspired by their attempt to capture that \\"old\\" sound and past glory.  I don't think that was the bands intention anyway.  I think they were trying to make something enjoyable to the masses while being creative and it falls short...to a point.  Yes, there are some high points.  Yes, there are some low.  One of the lows happens to be from the production side.  I swear I heard some low grade grit (dirty) background on several tracks.  It could be due to how modern music is recorded.  It used to be called \\"brick walling\\" by pumping up everything as loud as possible and then running it through a compressor to level the recording out.  This KILLS dynamics.  Thing is I don't hear that grit on every track so it has to be something else.  The other issue is garnering my attention.  It's almost like they are too technical and trying to be creative and give off energy in a studio environment is not an easy task.<br /><br />In conclusion I rate this with 3 stars due to how well Rush does play and that there are about 4 tracks that actually do stand out.  IMHO I believe they would have benefited by making the songs shorter.  This has a lot to do with holding my attention span.  Having had my say I know there will be those who disagree and that is fine.  Let's see where this effort stands 20 years from now.  That will be the true test!recapture that old glory from their earlier success.  Try as they might it falls short due to trying rather than going with their emotion(s).

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What can I say about the Hunger Games Books that most readers do not already know? I wanted to read the books before the first Movie was released, and finished it just in time. The Movie Grossed 55 Million the first weekend. The writer takes you right along with the action, sometimes you laugh, at other times you want to cry. And the second book \\"Catching Fire', and the third \\"The Mockingjay\\" are as exciting as the the first book. Written for adolescent's,and enjoyed by all !

B007ZD17XO|5.0|Easy to learn.  The more you play the faster you become at spoting the higher point gem stones.  Sometimes you connect three stones that cause a REAL cascade of droping gem stones and the screen explodes with activity.  It's fun to watch!  Colorful and enjoyable to play.  I have another basic gems app but it doesn't come close to how well and how much thought was put behind Montezuma 3.  If you like to make gems disappear,  this is the one!

0062197258|4.0|Brief summary: Catherine, a vivacious young woman commences a relationship with Lee, an ostensibly \\"perfect\\" guy, only to realize that he is turning into a nightmare versus a dream come true.  As damaging as his physical abuse is, the mind-games he plays with her - he is an arch manipulator - leave even more devastating emotional and mental problems.  Just before he re-enters her life, she meets Stuart - a truly wonderful man who prompts her to begin the tough journey to reclaiming her life and getting beyond the OCD and panic that her awful experience with Lee left her with.<br /><br />Potential spoilers ahead.<br /><br />What makes this book heavy going is that the author gives us a detailed, first-person account (literally, since this story is written in first-person) of what is it like to suffer almost crippling panic-related OCD.  Cathy is exhausted by this, and so are the readers.  Some have not found that entertaining - and that wouldn't be my word for it either - but it is effective.<br /><br />It is true that the book switches back and forth in time, often after just a couple of pages, but for me, this parallel story telling was also effective - helping us directly connect what Lee did to Cathy to the various OCD manifestations/practices.<br /><br />Stuart was a wonderful hero - supportive but not a doormat.  I really liked and admired Cathy as the heroine - and appreciated that the author let her be very high maintenance at times with Stuart as she tried to find some fragment of normalcy within herself upon which she could build a new life and relationship.<br /><br />I think the author also did a very good job showing the fall-out within Cathy's social circle - because Lee was so \\"perfect\\" on the surface and great at spinning things, poor Cathy not only had to deal with his abuse, but with the fact that no one believed her.  She was so alone and it was heartbreaking.<br /><br />A warning, too - the description of the physical abuse was quite graphic, mostespecially the final beating. Perhaps it felt even worse because she had been on the brink of escape.<br /><br />I do have one pretty significant quibble however - I wanted to know more about Lee and his formative experiences.  What led him to such villainy?  He wasn't a cardboard cut-out evil man - there were times he showed true tenderness.  It seemed genuine and not simply a part of his schtick to gain Cathy's trust.<br /><br />In the end, this was a gripping read with a hard-won happy ending.  Cathy was a strong heroine who battled back from experiences that almost destroyed her.  And she had a wonderful hero in Stuart to hold her hand while she fought the battle.

1401235417|5.0|Snyder is the best thing to happen to Batman and comics in general. While other writers such as Grant Morrison and Peter Tomasi have taken there shots at Batman, I felt Snyder was the most successful. Morrison's Batman, Inc. and all tales leading up to it felt disjointed and disorganized. While I enjoy Morrison's experimental and trippy writing style, it fell flat for me in this title.<br /><br />There's not much to say about Snyder's work that hasn't already been said...just go get this book now!

I liked Catherine Zeta-Jones's take at Hit Me With Your Best Shot, and Juillian Hough even though a terrible actress is a pretty decent singer, but her cover of Journey's Don't Stop Beleving is sup par. The rest of the soundtrack is a miss, but atleast it's still better than the movie.

B005974CNA|5.0|Being a consumate metalhead most of my life, I think (perhaps the natural testosterone level drop now that I am in my 40´s explains it) no non metal band has captured me so fast and made me feel so many emotions than DT. I knew the band existed, but like many others, only had heard (now one of my least favorite DT tracks) Pull me under. I went in 2010 to a concert in my hometown Lima, Peru. It was one of the best concerts I had ever seen, the musicality, the power, the virtuosity. For the first time in years a song made me dry tears from my cheeks, I was bewildered, caught by surprise by Petruccis classical guitar introduction to Hollow Years. Today I have listend to most of their material. I love Black Clouds, and the classic stuff too, but I am not one bit dissapointed by A Dramatic Turn of events. It is milder but it is musically tighter tha BC. Le Brie sounds great, Rudess´ contribution is felt widely though the tracks, Petrucci is brilliant as ever, Myung is also great. Breaking all Illusions is one of the best songs I have ever heard, period. I must confess I love the ballad Beneath the Surface, Le Brie is in top shape in that track. All around a solid album, great music and what we all have come expect from DT. Sadly, they are not going back to Lima (we were only 2000 lucky fans that night), but I hope to catch them in Buenos Aires or Santiago later this year. Long Live DT!

1936608898|5.0|This is my first book review and only my second Amazon review ever, which should speak to how strongly I feel about this book.<br /><br />I originally came to discover the Paleo lifestyle online after being diagnosed with gluten intolerance. I found MarksDailyApple.com, and started to do more online research into intolerances and chronic diseases, and tweak my diet further. I have read the False Fat Diet (eye opener on food intolerances and elimination diet), The Primal Blueprint, The Paleo Solution, and WellFED. All were useful, but a little rambling and less straightforward than I wanted. I was aware of the Whole30 through my online research, but always considered it too extreme and its authors a little more intense in their health quests than I was willing to be.<br /><br />When I found out they were writing a book, I pursued the table of contents, read some available pieces online, and determined that this was exactly the more straightforward resource I had been looking for, one that I hoped would answer the questions I still had and be something I could share with others curious about this lifestyle. I bought It Starts With Food the day it became available and it is my favorite food/lifestyle resource to date.<br /><br />I originally bought It Starts With Food for my mother-in-law. She's having trouble losing weight with CW and her doctor recently convinced her to go on cholesterol-reducing medication. I planned to buy the book, review it myself, and share it with her as a friend (rather than a diet-preacher). By the second chapter, I was turning to my husband and saying, \\"I have to send her a copy NOW. No one should have to wait for this information.\\"<br /><br />Quite frankly, this book is what I was looking for all along. It explains WHY + HOW in American women's preferred way to learn about new lifestyles - in diet book form. By that, I don't mean that the authors overemphasize weight loss over health (the opposite in fact), but that the way it is laid out is similar to other wildly successful diet books (South Beach comes to mind) and magazines. It is sprinkled with testimonials (personal connections), written in a real-life relate-able dialogue (Fat can be used as energy? Sweet.), and contains an actionable meal plan that leaves no room for guessing. In short, it is the perfect tool for people looking for a how-to primer on how to establish an elimination diet to determine intolerances, and also, how to live their best life possible.<br /><br />The sections on hormones are eye opening and the meal map is hugely helpful. Since I started on this journey in October 2011, I have read COUNTLESS blogs and articles, plus the aforementioned books, and here are the changes it took reading It Starts With Food for me to make:<br />Finally quit corn and rice<br />Eat breakfast as soon as possible in the morning<br />Choosing lean meats or draining the fat for any industrial-produced meat<br />Revamping my oil habits and making doubly sure to reduce Omega-6's (new goal for me)<br />Made my own bone broth! (it's incredible and easy and cheap)<br /><br />I can not recommend the book highly enough. I consider myself an average consumer, albeit a little more interested in nutrition. I'm not a scientist, a dietician, a clinician, or a paid reviewer, but I value this book and the messages in it and I think you will too.
0345803485|1.0|I was less than enamored with the sex-crazed pages of Fifty Shades of Grey, finding the writing to be uninspiring, repetitive and overall flat. The innocent portrayal of the inexperienced child-like college virgin made my inner-feminist cringe, as she repeatedly subjected herself to sexual acts bordering on abuse to win the affection of the predatory Mr. Grey. I was happy to leave Anastasia's story at the end of book one.

B0069JBKHI|1.0|When you read all of the features this thing has one can only get excited about it.  Buyer beware, this thing is constantly failing.  The video always freezes and half the time the whole connection fails so I can't even hear my daughter.  I even spent the time and money moving my router around in the house so I could hardwire the monitor directly to the Internet.  The connection has gotten a little better but still fails.  I understand that sometimes connections get interrupted the worst part for me is the app has never successfully reconnected on its own.  I can't tell you how many times I have woken up only to find the monitor not actually working.  If the connection is lost the app shouldn't stop until it reconnects and if it goes 5 minutes without being able to reconnect it should alert me saying \\"I am a piece of junk, i lost the connection and can't get it back.  Please quit the app and reconnect.\\"
0425263908|3.0|Well, For starters I read the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy before coming upon Bared to You. Don't get me wrong I loved the story about Christian and Anastasia. After completing Fifty Shades, I felt hopeless and needed a new book QUICK and in a hurry. Bared To You was the new it. The story however resembled Fifty Shades too much and kind of withdrew me at times to put it down. Not sure how I feel about an imitation, but the author, Sylvia Day, really killed the story when she made Gadieon ( what kind of name it that anyway... the name itself does not do it justice if he's this gorgeous guy) a Dominant. Hint Hint<br />BARED TO YOU IS NO FIFTY SHADES
B003IKMR0U|5.0|Zombie Dice has become a new passtime favorite among me and my friends.  The gameplay is fun and exciting, combining love for zombies and yahtzee.  The dice are very durable and look great.  The container shows wear and tear after a few games, however.  Not a huge problem, just watch out for the bottom lid coming undone and sending dice everywhere :)
B007N85ZXY|5.0|Neil Young has achieved a miracle with this latest release. Joined with old band mates, Crazy Horse, he has taken familiar songs from the american folk songbook, some relegated to children's nursery rhymes, many considered old hat... and he has breathed fire and soul into them. For instance, on the tune Clementine, Neil's singing and playing infuse its skeletal architecture with aching loss and dark loneliness that seem to cry out from the abyss of human suffering through the eons.  This song should've been a flop, if you pay attention to music trends, the industry, what's \\"cool.\\" etc.  Instead, its a painful, beautiful classic destined to climb into the cannon of his 100 greatest songs ever recorded. The Horse's take on \\"She'll be Coming 'Round the Mountain When She Comes (Jesus' Chariot)\\" brings to mind the power and intensity of Rockin' in the Free World. A tip to the hat to the freedom train and civil rights, the Horse shovels magic into the furnace of this locomotive.  Neil's take on This Land is Your Land, with original lyrics from Woody's no-so-blind patriot classic reflects the economic and social realities of today. The Great Recession will pass before this song loses its luster. Both could last forever. All the tracks on this album surprise the listener with their quality, originality of arrangement, and feeling. Keep in mind that this reviewer also feels strongly that Le Noise, Mirrorball, and Living with War were also classics. Americana is timeless in its heart. These songs will sound relevant and great in a hundred years. Of course, by then, Mother Earth will be the new world anthem.<br /><br />If you were looking for the album you THOUGHT Neil Young should put out, you're outta luck again. If you were looking for the latest output from the incredible Neil Young.... who seems to have plugged his mind's eye into the electrical socket of the ancient muse herself, then take delight, lay back, and let the hypnotic electric guitar take you away, as only theGodfather of Grunge can do, a possessed maestro with his guitar sounding just like a jet engine in a hurricane.<br /><br />If Bob Dylan hadn't smoked cigarettes for all those decades, perhaps he could put out sweet sounding music like Neil pours out... like he backed over a fire hydrant with his Linc Volt! But the water pipe is gushing a geyser of music, showering down on the faithful as if from heaven above. Thanks Neil! PS-Don't get me wrong, I'm a Dylan maniac. But lets face it, cigs just don't help anyone to have a better singing voice in the long run.  Dylan is still the Shakespeare of our time, tho!
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Love this audio interface.<br /><br />Thought it would be relevant to others to note that it works flawlessly with my Dell XPS 15 through Abelton Live.

You cannot do better for this price. Had some problems with Acid Pro and the customer support was also incredibly efficient.

B005FITIK0|5.0|A lot of people who do movie reviews seem to have some kind of ignorant assumption about them, they expected something else and didn't get what they wanted. Honestly, this was one of the best movies I have ever seen in a while. Charlize Theron was great. Probably because I find her character very easy to relate to. She finds marriage and babies boring, as do I. She is dependent on alcohol and find small town people useless, she belongs in the big city away from everyone's ignorance and meaningless life. I found her to be just like me. I feel like a lot of people who watched this movie are people who are like the small town people in this film, hostaged with babies and marriage just watching a movie on a Saturday night that didn't keep their attention because they have no open mind to someone with problems or who doesn't think that the american dream is what suits them. I absolutely loved this movie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazon game great awesome recommend to may friends will y'all try it out its really fun and has a wide verity of choices and is free
B0016492BW|5.0|The movie was shipped to me with much haste. I love having different versions of the movie so I can easily share it with my friends and family. The quality of the film is well worth the price.
0345529057|5.0|I am a huge fan of the show and decided to give the books a shot, mainly since I don't feel like waiting a year for HBO to do the next season.  If you like the show then you will absolutely like the books.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is the first book I've read by Sophie Kinsella but it certainly won't be the last!  I enjoyed every minute and had a hard time putting it down.  It is smart, funny, and definitely keeps you guessing.  Five stars for sure!!

0345803485|3.0|Format: Kindle Genre: Early 21st century Romance. Interestingly, Fifty Shades generates comparatively few middle of road reviews. I cannot recall seeing such an even split between haters and lovers of a book. There are fifty hundred-plus reviews of this book/series posted here on Amazon. So I won't bother to summarize a narrative plot that has already been summarized fifty hundred different ways. What's to love, and perhaps more importantly, what's to hate?<br /><br />Like many readers I read for different purposes in different contexts. One of my reading scenarios is reading while on the stairclimbing machine at my gym. For this I select fluffy novels with narratives I don't have to concentrate on or think about. I read on my Kindle. Generally, a decent fluffy novel will keep me climbing for one hour before I remember just how tired/hot/sweaty/bored I am. Fifty Shades kept me climbing for about 45 minutes before I felt like chucking my beloved Kindle across the gym. But enough about me and context, now onto Fifty Shades.<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey (and its progeny) was easy to read, with a fairly evenly paced plot, and, as many have commented, an uncomplicated narrative about two people playing around with their own sexuality.  Essentially, she discovers coital addiction (what else do we expect from a virgin) while he learns (and we learn) to understand his need to control his and others' sexual acts. The narrative language is unsophisticated, the scenes unrealistic, the cultural bloopers laughable, and the characters are caricatures of a poor little undervalued-for-her-beauty innocent and the wealthy, dashing needs-to-be-saved-by-the-woman-who-loves-him rogue.<br /><br />How is this book different from most romance novels? I think it has to do with the sex. It's everywhere, and what I mean is that it happens nearly everywhere within the narrative world and in nearly every chapter. Some raters are calling this book \\"mommy porn\\" to allude the fantasies harried,working women (on stairbclimbers, maybe?) with children and the same old husband can vicariously experience while reading this book. Sure, I see that. And is that so bad? It's fiction, bad fiction for reading sake, but its corniness (and a word that rhymes) makes it both a subject of fascination and scorn all at once.<br /><br />I have to say the dialog and writing did cause me to roll my eyes. A lot. (Uh-oh.) Yet despite her lack of writing prowess, EL James has enjoyed overwhelming sales (the books are everywhere I look). This is one author who is laughing her way to the bank. I hated that I wouldn't stop reading it even though I didn't like a single line of this book.<br /><br />I rate this book three stars for its pedestrian construction of \\"mommy porn\\" via a fantasy narrative that follows a tried and true popular romance paradigm about a virgin who tries to resist but quickly falls for a young, self-made, wealthy man who has (mommy) issues.
B0086700CM|5.0|Anyone who complains that it never ends, well, Duh! You have to continually beat YOUR last score. What's wrong with that? It's a fun, fast paced game that allows for mindless running with a simple flick or slide. My 5 yr old has mastered this game...maybe the whiners haven't gotten the hang of it yet?
0545265355|5.0|Love the books - and now I have them in a cool box set! Shipped fast too! Looking forward to buying the movie on Amazon as well!
1936608898|5.0|Whether you are a Paleo/Whole30 newbie, skeptic, or a hardcore nerd you will love this book!    Dallas & Melissa have distilled over 400+ scientific references (located at the back of the book) as well as their experience with their Whole9/Whole30 program into a single, concise, completely awesome book! The book has a great, easy to read flow to it, with their classic humour interwoven into it.    The basic outline of the books runs through:  1) The 4 \\"Good Food\\" principles that they use to evaluate food that will make you healthier (or won't)  2) Using this criteria, they evaluate which food should make up the bulk of your nutrition (and those that don't make the cut are clearly spelled out and why)  3) How to go about implementing their Whole30 plan based on the above    and lastly ... a meal map! Think of this as a culinary \\"given a man a fish vs. teach him how to fish\\" type of approach. You will learn some basic templates for various types of dishes and then some suggestions .. the rest is up to you .. use your imagination!    Personally I think the Meal Map is worth the price of the book alone! The most anticipated meal in this book (IMHO) has to be Dallas' mocha steak rub! What could be better than a nice juicy steak marinated in coffee and chocolate (oh and other spices too).    Hit up their website at [...] for more information on this book and a slew of extra resources not included in the book!
B0086700CM|4.0|didn't. think it was the kind of game I would like. well I was wrong.fun and fast paced game. try it and see.it's free you cannot go wrong
B007P6VLR8|4.0|From me this album gets B- or C+. I am just very excited to get a new album from Smashing Pumpkins at all. For this alone I am grateful.<br /><br />After listening to it for several times I can not say WOW. It is pretty good but far from great. I think I like it the same or even less than Zeitgeist. Combining certain songs from these two last albums would make a really great album, I think.<br /><br />Still would definitely recommend to all who appreciate the music of Smashing Pumpkins.<br /><br />EDIT: A couple of words about the Vinyl. It is a double LP in book fold sleeve that has all the lyrics printed on the inside. The inner sleeves are black. The LPs are black as well. Does not come with a cd or a MP3 download.
B006ON41FC|5.0|I love it.The only thing I don't like about it is it keeps asking to rate.Still great tho.Awesome graphics&hellip;Oh I cant make the goals and I play this all the time!!
B005IQZB14|5.0|Strayed's words are life-changing, both for her and her readers.  Anyone who has ever been on a journey of self discovery can identify with every thought, feeling, and wished-for longing of how she wishes for a life that didn't materialize but is dealing with the life she got.<br />Life-changing, uplifting, funny, depressing, whiny - we've all been there - what makes this book is the voice of Cheryl Strayed.  Her powerful language made me feel as if I was walking right beside her.<br /><br />This was the first book in a LONG time that I literally could not put down.
B007VGXS8M|1.0|I have not yet gotten it but thanks for the reviews I will not get it so I'm not wasting my money
B001KZI2WW|5.0|I have always been reluctant to own a traditional pair of the Crocs Clogs because they just arent 'my style\\", however I saw these in a Bass Pro Shop while I was on vacation and thought they were awesome looking!!  I tried them on and liked them even more. I didn't buy them that day in Bass Pro because I didn't want to spend the money then, but my wife remembered and surprised me with them on Father's Day From Amazon (She rocks).  They are extremely comfortable!! I have literally never owned a pair of shoes more comfortable than these. I find myself wearing them even in the house when I would normally take other shoes off!<br /><br />I normally wear a size 9.5 and I found a 9 was much too small, and a 10 was slightly big but not much, so a 10 was the way to go. The first few days there is a small amount of unraveling from the frayed edges, but this seems normal.<br />Do yourself a favor and give these a shot. You will never look at Crocs the same way again!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This app allowed me to download magazines and books including the Bible--which I know the kindle can do already, but it also allowed me to be able to highlight, underline, make notes, and go to pages easier. I love it!
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I agree with those who say this is Joe Walsh's best album ever. If there was ever a \\"comeback\\" album, this is it. I also have to say that if you like Joe Walsh and Jeff Lynne (I like both) you will LOVE this album. If you like one or the other, you will probably like it as well. If you like Joe Walsh and hate Jeff Lynne, you may not like it. And if you hate both, then you're probably not reading this review anyway! The Jeff Lynne influence is heavy, but unlike some of the less-than-perfect reviews, I don't think it is over-produced at all.<br /><br />I've been a casual Joe Walsh fan ever since \\"Life's Been Good,\\" and the last album of his I bought was the medicore \\"Ordinary Average Guy\\" over 20 years ago. But when I saw him on TV in an Eagles reunion concert back in the mid-1990s, I thought he was finished. He looked old, he wore Coke bottle glasses, and it seemed that all the years of substance abuse had done irreversable damage. Boy was I wrong! This album shows a revived, reenergized, and better than ever Joe Walsh. I can only remember a few albums that I instantly liked song after song the moment I heard them. This is definitely one, and I truly mean that this is the best album he has ever put out. The songs are well written, well produced, and extremely personal. Yes, there are a couple of songs I'm not that crazy about, but the vast majority are incredible. This album is definitely worth buying and if you have a chance to see him in concert this summer, do it!
B005L38QHA|3.0|The body of the mouse was very smooth.  I couldn't keep the palm of my hand from sliding forward.  I quit using it after one month.  Go to the a local computer store and try it on for size and comfort before you buy.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|Genre(s): Rock, Electronica<br />Hardest/Heaviest song(s): Given Up, No More Sorrow, Bleed It Out<br />Softest song(s): Leave Out All The Rest, Shadow of the Day, In Between, Hands Held High<br />Strangest song(s): Hands Held High, Valentines Day, In Between, The Little Things Give You Away<br />Best song: In Pieces<br />Worst song: No More Sorrow<br />Pros: Innovative, daring, good vocals<br />Cons: Mike Shinoda's presence is minimal<br /><br />The Beatles were praised for taking risks in their music, but Linkin Park are condemned by so-called \\"fans.\\" That's just a fact, and it's a little sad. Let me begin by saying that Linkin Park had to change because they grew out of the Nu Metal scene (and on top of that, the Nu Metal genre sank, partially because how could anybody--Linkin Park or other bands--top Meteora?) and they've never looked back. Hybrid Theory and Meteora are great, nobody can deny that. But, here's the thing, when there's no more oil how can it be siphoned out? It can't. By the time 2005 rolled around, the Nu Metal scene was drained for all it was worth--and they built an ark to survive the flood: Minutes to Midnight. Other bands ignored the warnings--Limp Bizkit, Staind, Deftones, Disturbed, Korn, P.O.D., System of a Down, Crazy Town and Adema . . . where are these bands? Yes, some are still making music, but they're nowhere near as successful as Linkin Park is . . . and that's because Linkin Park SURVIVED the Nu Metal extinction-event.<br /><br />Simply put, as awkward and \\"disappointing\\" as an album that some people think Minutes to Midnight is, it was also a key factor in the fact that they're still making massively successful singles and albums to this day (even if ATS was as equally misunderstood).<br /><br />But here's what I think about Minutes to Midnight five years after its release. At the time it was revolutionary; and right now it's legendary. Yes, legendary. But, the only reason it's legendary is because the I'm-Linkin Park-fans-but-I-hate-everything-Linkin Park-did-after-Meteora people still talk about it to this day (in a negative light, sure, but they're keeping the flame alive, aren't they?); however, based on the songs on the album and considering I'm a fan who respects their recent stuff, it's just a really good album in general--and it's probably my least favorite album from Linkin Park. But it's not a 1/5; it's not a 2/5; it's not a 3/5. I'll accept a 4/5. But really, let's be real. When you listen to this album from beginning to end, you'll realize it's a fulfilling album. It's got some hard songs, some soft songs, they took some risks (with Mike Shinoda singing and accoustic), some rapping . . . and really thought-provoking lyrics.<br /><br />Yeah, some of the songs were political. But other than saying Bush was an idiot (I'm a republican and I can agree with that), the politics don't really take sides.<br /><br />ONE) WAKE: This is an instrumental. Nothing too special about it, except it promises a change from their previous two albums.<br /><br />TWO) GIVEN UP: a punk influenced song with heavy guitars and intense vocals.<br />RATING: 7/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: AGGRESSIVE<br /><br />THREE) LEAVE OUT ALL THE REST: a beautifully sung ballad.<br />RATING: 9/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: SELFLESS<br /><br />FOUR) BLEED IT OUT: one of the only rapping songs on the album; the song is actually about how frustrating it was to write the lyrics for it. Funny but true.<br />RATING: 10/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: FAST<br /><br />FIVE) SHADOW OF THE DAY: this was the song that impressed me the most on the album when I first listened to it.<br />RATING: 10/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: CATCHY<br /><br />SIX) WHAT I'VE DONE: this was the first single and arguably one of the best on the album.<br />RATING 10/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: TRANSCENDENT<br /><br />SEVEN) HANDS HELD HIGH: prior to ATS and LIVING THINGS, this song had the longest rap verses from Mike.<br />RATING: 10/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: CURVEBALL<br /><br />EIGHT) NO MORE SORROW: to be honest, there just isn't enough to love this song. And a lot of people who don't like this album will probably like this song the most, just because it's heavy.<br />RATING: 6/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: HEAVY<br /><br />NINE) VALENTINES DAY: a short and sweet song. A lot of people don't like it . . . probably because of the title, but really it's quite catchy.<br />RATING: 8/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: HEARTBREAKING<br /><br />TEN) IN BETWEEN: the first song ever that Mike Shinoda sings.

And it's effective (I remember because I had gone through a breakup just before the album came out).<br />RATING: 10/10<br />ONE WORD SUMMARY: JAZZY<br /><br />TWELVE) THE LITTLE THINGS GIVE YOU AWAY: accoustic and long.

0425263908|4.0|I have to say first and foremost that I do not agree with everyone who is saying this is a rip off of 50 Shades. I have read all three fifty shades books and loved them, but this book I was hooked the instant I started. I literally could not put it down. I read the whole book in less than 6 hours. The writing is amazing. The story telling and characters are extremely captivating and I can't wait for the next one:)
1451626657|2.0|Repetitive, boring, long, and the constant self-contradicting statements got old real fast. I get that it's a criticism of war and bureaucracy and all that but it's a really poor one in my opinion. 2 stars for being mildly amusing and some cleverness here and there.
1466401885|5.0|Like everyone else I fell in love with Travis Maddox. This story is absolutely captivating and amazing. I have literally read it 4 times now. I couldn't put it down for a second. As a fellow writer this is the type of story telling I aspire to write. Thank you Jamie for your amazing words, and beautiful story.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Great movie about coming of age! It does have some boy troubles, but not the mushy-gushy twilight stuff. It also has some comic relief.

B007FDE4Y8|2.0|I'll be honest, as I took a gamble with this purchase. I wanted something that I could use with a number of different cameras, so I thought the range provided by the SteadyVid Pro would be adequate.<br /><br />I did my research beforehand on how to adjust static and dynamic balance, and saw that there were some problems with lighter cameras. Using a GF1 with a 14-150, I used two of the \\"extra\\" weights instead of the main weight which was quickly apparent as too heavy. But those ended up being too light by themselves, and I had to add on another hex nut (not included, but easily found at a hardware store) for some additional weight. Even so, adjusting for balance was difficult as it seemed adjustments could be knocked around even after tightening screws.<br /><br />Overall, fairly frustrating to use with a lighter camera. Beware that \\"Supports up to 5 lbs\\" does not seem applicable to cameras less than 1.5 lbs.

B002BU0DPE|5.0|I'm extremely happy with these headsets. I purchased two, one for myself and one for my husband. We used them to play Black Ops, and this allowed me to hear footsteps coming up on me camping! I heard a lot of trash talking because they were getting killed over and over again. Even more when they find out it's a girl! The voice clarity is great! Great price point!
B0086700CM|3.0|its a really fun game... but the graphics slow down and then you die even if you were doing great!
0634049011|5.0|I am just starting my quest to make sense of the guitar as an instrument. I bought this workbook and I'm only about a fourth of the way through and I feel like I've learned so much already. If you are just starting out with the guitar and want to truly understand the notes on the fretboard and how to be more able to locate them then this workbook will do just that for you. Very glad I found this book. Highly recommend it!

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Oceania is brilliant in the sense that it is very much a Smashing Pumpkins album, but without trying to be a Smashing Pumpkins album.  This feels like the first time since Adore that Billy has said to hell with any pretenses on what the album \\"should\\" be and just wrote an album for his own reasons.  Its obvious Corgan does not want to live in the past and end up a novelty act who cashes in on his past successes.  He wanted to prove that he as an artist can be relevant in 2012 and beyond.  And I can say without a shadow of a doubt this album has proven that Corgan still has a place on top of the rock world and that Oceania will be looked back on as a classic Smashing Pumpkin album. From top to bottom this album is filled with strong songs that seem to build off eachother.  I can say that I wouldnt pick one or two stand out songs on this album as each track is needed to help the album flow so brilliantly.  Also,  I highly recommend this album on Vinyl.. It was a great pressing and sounds fantastic.

0385344228|5.0|[[ASIN:B0050DIWFC Defending Jacob: A Novel]]<br /><br />I am an avid reader having read 100's of books maybe thousands throughout my lifetime.  I read this on my Kindle and could not stop reading it till I was finished.  It took me a little more then a day to read and it was time very well spent.  This is one of the best novels I have read in quite a while. The author grabs you from the first page and does not let you go until the last page.  The book is so well written that if I didn't know better I would think that it was a true story.  I could see this book being based upon a conglomoration of several true stories that have made it to the media. Landay obviously knows his way around the court system and the district attorneys office. Never boring, engrossing to the point that I had to finish it in one fell swoop to see what the outcome was. Excellent ending, nothing I would have imagined.  If I could give this novel more then 5 stars I would.  If you are into non boring court room novels you will not be disappointed when you pick this one up.  I cannot recommend this enough to those readers who enjoy court room novels that are excellently written, superbly thought out with a fantastic ending that will not let you down.
0345803485|1.0|Ok, I wanted to find out what the hoopla was all about and I'm still waiting to find out after I read this book. Really? People actually think this is a good story? What was the plot again? Exactly. This story was all over the place and the writer seemed like she was writing the first draft of a paper for her sixth grade English class. I love erotica, but this book was more erratic than erotic. If you really want to read an erotic book with hot sex and all the toppings of a good novel, check out this author, Richard Jeanty. He has written many erotic books and he doesn't disappoint. The first title I would suggest is Sexual Exploits of a Nympho I & 2, but he has many others, such as The Bedroom Bandit, Mr. Erotica and many more. Give him a try.

B005USZYDU|1.0|I have read other Boone episodes and thought I was paying for a whole book. Turns out it's only a half a book. The story stops dead at the end of the listed pages with out finishing anything. I feel like I have been ripped off Grisham, where is the last half of the book? Or haven't you written it yet. I expected better from him! What there was of it was the usual Grisham captivating. I'm not going to pay for the other half of the story!!!<br />John
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|love it since it is free and u get all the levels with 2011 and 2012 it is a great deal do name sure u get it today

B00846REIS|4.0|I am going to echo what others have said, this is a lot like 50 Shades.  Girl stumbles into boy, boy is hot, girl is attractive, then crazy bedroom antics ensue, not as kinky as the scenes in 50, but they are pretty steamy.  Overall, I liked this book, as it took me 3 days to read it, and I will be purchasing the 2nd one when it comes out in October.
B00881VLCE|5.0|It has so many different puzzles to choose from for free! And the ones you have to pay for are as cheap as 0.99.. It even gives you the option to just choose from the edge pieces. Sometimes it does glitch and when you drop the pieces, they dont land where you let them go, but off to the left. I play this app every time ilI get a chance. I love it!
B007JF8NRQ|5.0|The finale was only played once for all i know. since the show is on monday nights from 9 to 10pm i had to go to bed due to school. I was left wondering what would happen at the end of season 2. This is my favorite show and i could not resist spending 3$ to watch it. It is a little blurry and pauses. ( My computer is not slow) but i just wanted to see what happened. CANT WAIT TILL FALL 2012 FOR SEASON 3!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|the app is accurate and always up to date. I live in south Florida, where the weather changes within minutes and is not consistent across the area: it could be raining on one side of the street and not on the other. the satellite helps me plan my day, and better yet, my days off: of it's raining at one beach, it may not be raining at the botanical gardens. great app.

He needed a kick in the gonads and she is infatuated with this freak because she thinks she can help or fix him.

B0035JRVBO|2.0|This is the movie that made Hanks famous and also fetched him an academy award. Therefore, I had a lot of expectations going in to watching the movie. At the end of the movie,  I realized I had watched a linear narration of a man life from beginning to the end. Though it was interesting to watch, I'm not sure if I would watch it another time.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|In the first half of the book our heroine is bitchy, morose, and self absorbed. It's a bad case of PMS. By the end of the first half you pretty much know how the book will end. There are the usual twists and turns in the 3rd quarter which was a nice relief. I won't ruin the last part of the book except to tell you that the only person still feeling sorry for Katniss is Katniss. I wanted a heroic ending and what I got was tedium and self pity.
B0086700CM|4.0|Good game. Doesn't always read my finger right. Ill go right or left and he will jump. Kinda annoying but I guess I just have to move my finger better or something...

Why would you give someone like that one of the most powerful weapons in existence?<br /><br />After reading this book though, we find out that Sinestro does what he does because he does have the same goals as the Guardians do, he wants to bring order to the universe and stamp out lawlessness.  However he wants to do so by ruling out of fear and with an iron fist.<br /><br />***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***<br /><br />So I didn't think the revamp of the DC universe was going to work, but this was pretty interesting, check it out!
0439023513|2.0|Okay, if everyone is all up in arms with Twilight for being so super angsty, then I'msurprised no one tried to burn this book.  The story went from thsi great start to this fizzled end. It was so disappointing, not to mention depressing.  The dark suicidal tone was so not where the series started so it was sad.  NOt to mention the ending was such a cop out.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I read a lot and am super picky about what I read. I don't write reviews either but this book deserved my five stars and my review. Its phenomenal. Point blank. So stop reading reviews.  It'll just ruin the book. Go find out for yourself how truly amazing this book is. I promise it will be well worth your time and money! Go! :)
0439023491|4.0|But I felt like it got into angty territory a little.  The first book was so great.  This one was good, but the Gale, Peter, Katniss trianlge is wearing a little thin.  Action was great.  and the descriptions are so vivid.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Gog this app based on recommendation from friends.  I use it for a Bible study so that I have multiple translations available to reference.  Some versions also will be read to you via audio.  This is great for when I am in the car.  It does use a dataplan tod the phone.  Also love the reading plans!!  Loaded on both my Kindle Fire and Galaxy 2S.  Best part of all....its free!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book.  I don't normally read YA, but this was awesome.  Now I'm so glad I dind't see the movie now.  I'm sure I woudl hve walked away thinking that was good wehn the book was actually great.
0525423842|5.0|i have read most of John Grishams books, and my wife bought for me at the airport. it was a quick enjoyable read, and different than many of his books. I thought Theo was an interesting character, and I think young and old will enjoy the book. The plot is different and the characters and legal scenes are well done. the ending leaves an opening for more episodes in this new departure for this prolific author. I would recommend it highly for those who like Grisham.
B007ZZ3RI0|5.0|Even if you aren't an Adam Lambert fan but love pop music, RUN, don't walk, to buy this album!  He had a hand in writing almost all the tunes and it's taken two years to create, so this is the record he really wanted to make.  Love the dance numbers the most (especially \\"Cuckoo\\", \\"Naked Love\\" and \\"Pop That Lock\\").  The slower songs are more introspective (\\"Underneath\\")or \\"kinky\\" (\\"Chokehold\\").  Whatever your preference, you'll have to agree that each song showcases the exceptional, incredible pipes that this man possesses.  Once you hear these songs you'll want to see him in concert.  He is truly one of the most talented pop artists to come along in a long time, and he needs more mainstream followers to give him the recognition he deserves!

B005D9MUWY|4.0|I am a design engineer and switched from Swype to SwiftKey X. Swype was faster to type a paragraph than SwiftKey X, but Swype actually took longer overall because of having to go back and correct words that are misspelled, or that are not the intended word altogether. I have a need for speed when texting and accuracy and SwiftKey X is superior to Swype if accuracy is important. I accidentally insulted my Manager because of an incorrect unintended word that Swype inserted that I failed to catch before hitting the SEND button. Then I looked like a complete Moron trying to explain my way out of a Swype mistake. Because of this, I rated SwiftKey X 4 stars and Swype I gave 3 stars. The perfect product would be a combination of SwiftKey X and Swype.

B00005N5S5|5.0|This is a technological nocturnal nightmare. A chilling electronic score sets the tone. Enormous robotic killing machines rolling with tank treads over human skulls. Luminous and frightening laser weapon effects. Cyborgs, their living flesh burned away, crawl with an unrelenting objective to kill.<br /><br />\\"A storm is coming.\\"<br /><br />\\"I know.\\"
0749304456|5.0|This is the queen of all regency romances.  I've never read a better one, and I'm pretty sure I've read 90% of Heyer's.  They just don't write them like this anymore.  Delicious.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|really like this app. love the reading plans. only thing I dislike is not being able to use the Bible portion without wifi.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I rarely write reviews because I know people's tastes vary widely.  However, if I can stop even one person from wasting money on this book, I will consider this review a success.  I heard the hype.  I read the reviews.  I chose to ignore (based on some family member's urging) the bad reviews and to give the book a chance.  HEED THE WARNINGS!  This books is terribly written.  Awful!  It reminds me of a child's first book report in school where they have a minimum word count, \\"This book is really, really, really, really not worth your time.  Not day of it, not even an hour or a minute, or even a second.  The main character was a young, twenty-something, college student with long, blunt cut, blonde hair.  She really, really, really, really liked this handsome, young, rich, smart, interesting guy.\\"  I am certain that my elementary school child could write this book (minus the graphic sexual encounters and verbage).  Blech!  That is really, really, really, really as nice as I can be about it.  I have had to force myself to read it and I am just past the first sexual encounter.  I won't continue to waste my time.  I was dumb enough to give it a chance.  Please learn from my mistake.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|Excellent quality and great movies. Just the crisp image is enough, but the overall presentation and the addition of both versions just adds more value.
B001KZI2WW|3.0|I really love these shoes... they are so easy to wear with or without socks. My main problem right now is that the grip on the sole has worn off and they are so slippery in wet environments. They are less than a year old and I wear them nearly everyday. I would get another pair, but for $55+ I want to be able to wear them for at least a year, more would be appreciated. That is the only reason I can't give 5 stars.
0345803485|1.0|There's nothing wrong with a little BDSM. Or even a lot of it. In fact, that's really the only thing drawing me to this book. If I wanted to read a book about \\"lovemaking\\" (GROSS word, btw) with some light spanking followed by hours of crying, I'd watch a daytime soap or borrow a romance novel from my mother in law. To clarify, I'm not one of those readers who is horrified by the humiliation and control he exerts on her. Sometimes it's kind of hot. What I did find intolerable about this book is how unrealistic the characters are and how I don't give two pieces of rat droppings about them. As a 25 year old, let me tell you that no attractive intelligent 21 year old is a virgins. And that if they were, they'd engage in copious amounts of porn watching and well...you know. Secondly, no woman I've ever spoken to ever had orgasms the first time they had sex, nor did they have 6 in a row just by a man staring at her. Also, a person who blushes uncontrollably and that frequently by the presence of a man she sees for 70 hours a week should consult a doctor. Several people have already mentioned this but I'll say it again; this book is basically written from the perspective of a 16 year old and written for 16 year olds. None of the characters are relatable, none of the dialogue is interesting or realistic, and barely any of the erotica even erotic. Save money on Valium...purchase this book instead. And if you think only great writers write best sellers and get movie rights, think about Twilight.

0345803493|1.0|If you read my review for the first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" you'll understand why I chose NOT to read this 2nd installment. Put your money to better use if you want to read real erotic romance and buy \\"Every Night I'm Yours\\" by Christie Kelley. If you can handle the steam, Jaci Burton and Joey W. Hill's books will also provide plenty...

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This series starts off a little wierd, and I wasn't too certain I'd like where it was headed.  Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down!  Now I'm hoping for a 4th book, maybe follow up on the main characters but go deeper into some of the others.  This is not for someone who is offended by the more erotic!
B0086700CM|5.0|its Fun. i  play it all the time when I'm bored! I never get tired of it. enjoy the monkey things
B0086700CM|4.0|I wish they would add more features because I have been playing for less than a week and I have already unlocked everything. :(
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Each movie is in its own case, with the standard art inserts, and contains Disc 1 for each title. What you're getting when buying this is just the movies themselves. For a simple person like me who doesn't enjoy watching the 'Bonus 13 Extra Hours of Phenomenal Special Footage', I found this set to be exactly what I wanted.
B0086700CM|1.0|I liked this app at first and then it just got boring.  Also I wasted my time running to get ten thousand coins and when I went to the store I tried to scroll up but instead I got something I didn't want.  It sucked . Oh and I am not a nerd.
B003G4W49C|5.0|i luv this i luv luv it luv it you MUST get this book or i will buy it for you it is AMAZING
030758836X|1.0|I don't like spoilers in reviews so won't include one here, but the ending of this book is so bad I can't believe it was ever published.  I had mixed feelings about the book -- somewhat clever, somewhat annoying -- but I stuck with it thinking the author would find a great way to wind it up.  Instead we get . . . you've got to be kidding me.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I am a real diehard reader and have read many books with series, etc.  I first reviewed this book and gave it 5 stars then I got to thinking about it and took away 2 stars and decided to review this book from the heart of how I really felt reading it.  First off there are too many phrases that the writer repeats over and over!  It becomes distracting after awhile and you just want it to stop so that was a negative.  While I understand Christian has a lot of emotional scars due to his lack of a good childhood he has supposedly moved past the hurt and fear enough to accept a wife, let her touch him and starts to open up about his past.  I agree with a lot of the reviews to nourish a pedophile turned friend's sick relationship is so not right.  Elena s/h/b arrested!  I would have liked to see more character development, maturity  and growth instead of all these up and down emotions with Christian and Ana.  We never found out if Ethan and Mia got together either!  A wife should never have to fear her husband like Ana did with all the mood swings.  This could have been a really great love story but all that sex is not even realistic!  No one can go at as much and rejuvenate that fast please!  I did like how the story ended with a happy ending for the couple but I needed more!  Oh well it was entertaining and for that I gave it 3 stars!  I've read better and worse!
030788743X|3.0|This was a fun read. Don't think too much about it. Many in the geek-world are, predictably, ascribing significantly more value to it than is worth. That's common for them to do (remember when The Watchmen movie was going to be a seismic cultural event?), but it really shouldn't be on any best book of the year lists.<br /><br />People have already covered the upside of this fun read, so I'll focus on ways it could have been better:<br />1. If the author was in his early 20s and, himself, discovering the 80s second-hand like his protagonist I think the separation would have done the book some good to have some non-personal distance from the decade. I could never forget the middle aged man shoving the heirlooms of his youth into every nook and cranny.<br /><br />2. There's a lot of inventiveness to this book, but also a good degree of laziness. Imagine if, rather than just regurgitating the 80s verbatim with full immersion by the youth of 2045, he explored ways that this future generation incorporated the 80s into their own culture. I mean, the 80s have come back around already, but it's been fused with modern pop culture. Likewise, he comes up with some good ideas for the future, but for more basic things seems to fall back on technologies we use today, didn't use 10 years ago, and probably won't use in another 10 years. Simply putting \\"classic\\" or \\"old\\" in front of some technology that is current to us isn't convincing enough.<br /><br />3. The writing is very average. I'll try to say this without spoilers, but if something bad happens nearby, you don't have to have the narrator tell readers multiple times that it would have been really bad for him if he were in the middle of it. I can figure that out.<br /><br />4. I think it would have been better if it weren't a full novel. About halfway through, I got it and saw where things were generally going. The gimmick started to wear thin and I found the 80s references more annoying than inspiring after a while (though, Imust say, I've found myself watching some old movies from the era as a result).<br /><br />That  said - it was fun. It was inventive. It was worth the time. Much like the pop culture it celebrates, however, it has little more to offer than forgettable fun.
1421539691|5.0|Despite owning all 12 original volumes of the manga, I still purchased the Black editions. The added color pages were really cool and I loved having a \\"reading copy\\" and a \\"collector's copy\\" (the original versions being the collector's copies and the Black editions being my reading copies). I love having 12 volumes of Death Note condensed into only 6. It makes taking the entire series with me on vacation much easier. Ahem, on this volume. I loved volume 11, but volume 12 still leaves something to be desired. Unanswered questions (unless you have How To Read 13) and a disappointing ending (Light's fate) made volume 12 one of the least appealing of all the volumes of Death Note. The Black Editions are definitely worth having, even if you have the original 12 volumes as well.

But he never returned to that total kick ass rocking out songs.Lodger put together some real interesting material.But when has he ever put out songs that made perfect sense? Just listen and enjoy.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love it is the most fun game in the world and the best part is that it never gets old!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|When I first watched this with my brother, I thought it was going to be a simple slasher, or a low budget B movie, and boy was I wrong.<br />This had me on the edge of my seat for some parts, and giggling at others - without it seeming like two different movies, or having anything seem randomly tossed in.  This was a seamlessly combined creepy-funny movie, where the bad guy just keeps giving you the willies, and the two main guys (in their new vacation home!) were just... trying to be helpful.<br /><br />I liked the point of view taken for this movie, it was new and refreshing, and when it was finished I came away with a ridiculous fondness for it, even if I won't be watching it all the time.  This is something you'll want to share with your friends, I would definitely suggest you get this movie.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Such an easy game to pick up.  Games don't last all that long and with the ever changing board, multiple games in one night are never boring.  Even my teenaged nephew, who does nothing but play video games and mocked the idea of playing a classic board game, was hooked after one game.
B007VTVGAQ|3.0|It makes me a little sad to rate such anticipated CD 3 stars.<br />The best way to describe \\"Idler Wheel\\" is VERY underwhelming, but a few of the songs are worth purchasing. The problem with the CD as a whole is that the messages are tired, and lacking structured melody.<br /><br />\\"Anything We Want\\" and \\"Hot Knife\\" were the highlights. These two stood out among the rest. They were stable, playful, and lighter (In the midst of a dark, gloomy album). Loved them both. They almost seem out of place here.<br />\\"Every Single Night\\" was released as a music video. A classic Fiona song, but the video was so abstract that it became literal. It reminds me of how her music videos have gone from elaborate and eccentric, to just plain weird. (Remember \\"Not About Love\\"?)<br /><br />Now for the drawbacks...<br /><br />It seems to be trendy nowadays to produce amateur sounding music. That didn't impress me. Most of the tracks have a faded instrumental to place emphasis on the vocals. Sadly, Fiona's voice also sounds garbled and a million miles away. Usually her voice is so distinct and clear. The whole \\"minimalist\\" style would have worked with a voice as bold her's, but it's a miss. I really wanted to like that angle.<br /><br />Second, was the overall delivery. the weak energy between songs is so identical, that I get them mixed up.<br /><br />**On a side note: This doesn't come in a jewel case. It's thicker cardboard that doesn't feel secure. The lyrics are sloppily hand-written instead of typed. The sketchpad look is a cool concept, but fairly illegible**<br /><br />I still wanted the same familiar demeanor, but less complaining about the latest breakup. (We've heard that SO much.) Less freestyle rhythm, faster beats, and...more than 10 songs. Is that too much to ask after waiting 7 years? As a whole, this CD is a disappointing listen. The more I listen to it, the more I wish how it could be improved. \\"The Idler Wheel\\" is....forgettable, and repetitive.<br /><br />This is a pretty brutal and nitpicking review of one of my favorite artists, but I can't help but be honest. I still love you, Fiona.

I'm so happy they got this app for the kindle fire plz listen to this review and GET THIS APP u may get a little frustrated when ur charchter goes really fast though I would loveeeeeee to give it 5 stars but sadily I cant because sometimes when ur chachter goes really fast it does glitches and pause witch can cause u to fail but when that is fixed I would gladily give it 5 stars plz get it
B007SGM084|5.0|What a great read! Best story I've read in a long long time. Once starting the first book, I had to keep turning pages and reading until finished. I just couldn't put it down! I think I was late to work the next morning too. Awesome love story with \\"hot stuff\\" included. The second and third books of the trilogy aren't quite as good as the first but necessary to find out what happens later. 5+ stars!
B006T4NQNO|3.0|Has anyone found a metal version of this type of adapter? I posted a review on the Canon version and it suffers the same - once threaded the filter and the adapter become one.
0425098532|4.0|Why read: Reading all of Agatha Christie's mysteries.<br /><br />What impressed me: As per usual, Christie delivers an unexpected mystery that will keep readers guessing until the very end. I also liked that the romantic plot lines were relatable even today - a woman whose fiance leaves her for another woman, did she kill said other woman because of her broken heart?<br /><br />What disappointed me: Poirot wasn't involved until the very end of the case, when Elinor was already on trial. Elinor was also a tough character to believe in, simply because she kept her emotions so tightly under wraps.<br /><br />Recommended: Yes. Not as well known as Christie's more famous mysteries, Sad Cypress will definitely entertain.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids and I play this together.  It's been a fun way for us to connect and have some friendly competition.  The games are original and run the gamut in difficulty.  Definitely a good time for all ages.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|There's something really scary to a lot of people about their favorite artist creating music that is new or, even worse, less produced that their following album. Most people seem to think that every album needs to get bigger and bigger, otherwise, it isn't better.<br /><br />Fiona Apple is an incredible songwriter; her lyrics are beyond poetic and her vocal stylings are rivaled by few. This album capitalizes on her strengths, instead of hiding them behind a sonic tapestry (not to say there isn't any merit in albums with layered production). Arrangements are sparse and the song is given precedent over all else. For some artists, people like Katy Perry or Kanye West, a great deal of production is wholly necessary, but for the singer-songwriter, there's nothing that can kill a song faster.<br /><br />This album is full of Apple's most visceral work yet, from the stunningly powerful opener \\"Every Single Night\\" to jaunty, as pop as Fiona will ever get \\"Periphery.\\" While the thematic content isn't something new for Fiona, the way she goes about it is more mature, more emotionally resonant than ever before. It's a departure from her earlier work--there feels like an there's an emptiness in the songs that would have killed releases like \\"Tidal\\" or \\"Extraordinary Machine\\". But this album is about what you don't hear, about what lurks in that empty space, and it makes moments like her blood curdling howls in \\"Regret\\" hit that much harder. Her voice has deepened slightly, she's more assured in her piano, and she just isn't afraid to hold anything back anymore. So she doesn't bother, and look what she made. More than worth the seven year wait, I feel like this is already one of my favorite albums.<br /><br />If you're new to Fiona, this might be a little off-putting--like listening to Tom Waits' Swordfishtrombones and having the growl of \\"Underground\\" overwhelm you. But to the long-time Fiona fan, this is a remarkable turning of a page. Who knows, maybe this is a good place tostart. I didn't like Tom Waits until I heard that album.
B005LAIHAY|4.0|If you like Escape From L.A. ,Escape From New York, Blade Runner, Die Hard Films you will like this. Its s new take on old films. I loved it, only down side is pg 13 when it could have been R. Good news tho, I hear the dvd will be Rated R. So as long as they add the violence back in I will give it 5 stars out of 5. Guy Pierce Got buff for the film and his character is just like Snake P (Escape From L.A.) Meets John M. (Die Hard). Its like CON AIR in space! You will love it!
B004EWEX9Y|1.0|It really Sucked....Bad....Sucked Really Bad!!!!<br />It had nothing to do with where I got it. Apple just makes bad products.
B005LAIHXQ|5.0|Have seen twice in theater already and can not wait for the dvd release. I picked up a blu ray player just for THIS film. It is amazing visuals, great cast, great story, great everything. If you are a fan of the alien films than go see it. When I watched it the first round I didnt take to it so much but on second viewing....wow. When going to watch just enjoy the film. Dont try and tie together the films, thats the mistake I made when first watching. Just sit back and watch. It will hit you days later craving more.<br /><br />Best film I have seen in past 5 years maybe longer. Side note: Noomi Rapace is the star of this show. I fell in love with her after this film. They could have made this film 4 hours long and with her as lead I would keep watching with no problem. She is an amazing lead, and they were smart to pick her. Blows Ripley away and then some. Perfect film. Dont listen to the haters, their mind couldnt understand it just like Blade Runner.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|A really good, accessible economic history the modern world. If you've read J. Diamond's Guns, Germs,and Steel, this gives an interesting alternative view of why nations have evolved the way they have.
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I was never really a Beyonce fan before, but after listening to this album, my opinions about her have changed. I don't understand how everyone is saying that this album made them fall asleep! I found every single track to be incredibly thoughtful and attention grabbing. Her voice is incredible, and in the tracks like I Was Here, her vocals really get to you. I love all of the songs on this album so much that I don't think I can pick a favorite! However, I think the most played one on my phone is Best Thing I Never Had, which is a GREAT song. I recommend the deluxe version because the extra 3 songs are definitely worth it, especially Dance For You ( The remixes are also ok too ).<br /><br />I dont think I have ever written a review on any album before, but this one really compelled me to. I hope the other critical reviewers give this album a second chance because they are missing out on a masterpiece.<br /><br />BUY THIS!
B004X75RK4|2.0|Mildly entertaining, but the falling in love in 3 days was not believable in this movie.  It had a good set up, but Sandra Bullock's character never became endearing, and resorted to the same \\"i love your family\\" lines that made While You Were Sleeping such a great movie.  Ryan Reynolds, Betty White, and some of the other characters were enjoyable.
1451608659|5.0|A brave and honest revealing of the dramatic personal life of a gymnastic icon. While Dominique's story is most unusual and unique and quite \\"mind blowing\\", the book also has several important layers that stick in the mind long after the book has been digested. How well are our young athletes protected in training? What priority does their health and well being have?  How fair is the system that selects them for team participation?<br /><br />The book is easy to read. I also appreciate the robust and sophisticated presentation of chapters in the book.  The format allowed two very diverse but extraordinary components to be presented as equal centerpieces in Dominique's dramatic story.<br /><br />The most remarkable, amazing, and inspirational of all is how healthy and well grounded a woman Dominique has become. I salute Dominique as a loving woman, wife, mother, sister, and articulate advocate for the young gymnastic athletes of tomorrow.  A fascinating read.

B0054R6BFM|5.0|This story is beautiful and amazing. Up to this book I thought I had read my favorite book but this tops them all. This story is very moving and deep. Once you start reading you are locked in emotionally even after you have finished reading. This book teaches everyone a lesson. You never know how people think of you and how important you are in their lives. This book reminds everyone that every choice you make can save someone or hurt them.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like it but it does get old. I got a few hours on enjoyment from it. Now I just play it to impress the kids at school. I would recommend for the car... it will at least make the kids quieter for a while.

B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is an awesome and addicting game. In it you have too run through the jungle while being chased by monkeys. You can complete objectives to earn coins. With coins you can buy new powers and characters. You can also buy new coins. I &lt;3 temple run!

0547258305|5.0|Katsa has a talent for killing people, and she's not an evil witch or nemesis in Graceling. She's the heroine.<br /><br />Graceling is set in a typical high-fantasy world of small kingdoms with a bit of magic, a few people  are born with \\"graces\\"--not all are violent, some have a swimming grace or a cooking grace. But not  Katsa--she's a stone cold bad ass. She can beat up or kill anyone, and in a world without guns, nothing can stop her.<br /><br />There is something very cathartic about Graceling and its killer heroine. Can you imagine--never having to fear walking alone at night, never worry about being mugged, raped, or even just pushed around, ever.<br /><br />It seems there's a run on killer girl heroines lately: Katniss in The Hunger Games,  Tris in Divergent. I hope the trend will continue. It's a welcome change from the wimpy I'll-curl-up-and-die-without-my-man Bella Swan from Twilight.<br /><br />Katsa is such an unapologetic powerful female character that I was a little disappointed that romance played so central a role in Graceling. But even love does not weaken Katsa. She takes her lover on her terms, and he in turn is not afraid of her power, even though she can beat him up. One of the best moments is when he says her ability humbles him. It doesn't humiliate him.<br /><br />Graceling is a very freeing fantasy, and dare I say it--a feminist one. I hope books with killer heroines will inspire girls to develop their fighting skills. And why not? If the Hunger Games can inspire an interest in archery. maybe it can inspire girls to learn to be bad ass fighters too.<br /><br />Girls should know how to fight. It's a tough world out there, and you certainly can't wait for a knight or a love sick vampire to come save you.
B0002PZVH0|5.0|Brian Eno - Ambient 1: Music for Airports (1978)<br /><br />Music For Airports would sound great in an airport lobby although I personally never think of that particular scenario when I listen to this. As a massage therapist I have a special relationship with this CD; it's one of my \\"go to\\" albums for relaxation during massage therapy. In fact, I can program this CD - using tracks 1,3,2,3,4 - to last exactly one full hour. The last track serves as a perfect notification that there are 10 minutes left for the massage. One of the few recordings I never get sick of, not even after many, many hours of listening. The cornerstone of great Ambient music, this CD is a must.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />Track 1/1 (first track of side one):  a zen-like yet off-kilter piano figure cascades into focus and proceeds to mingle for 17 minutes, stumbling gently through dazed humming tones. (17:21)<br /><br />Track 1-2: strange angels cast an exquisite wall of sound through single notes that swell with intensity. The multi-tracked vocals stand alone like rays from heaven. (8:54)<br /><br />Track 2/1: combines the piano of the first track with the voices on the second. (12:07)<br /><br />Track 2-2: This moody, droning synth piece sounds like waking up from a dream. (9:38)<br /><br />P.S. - I've had various copies of this CD including the version on display here. I have never heard a poorly recorded Brian Eno CD.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first review I have ever published on Amazon.  Before reading the Wool series I had given up on downloading self-published e-books because of many disappointments.  This series is not like any self-published fiction I have ever read before.  The quality and editing are top-rate.  The character development is solid and three-dimensional.  Even the secondary characters are people you become invested in.<br /><br />William Faulkner once said that the human heart in conflict with itself is the only thing worth writing about and that is what Hugh Howey writes about in the Wool series.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a really fun game. For the people who couldn't figure it out at all, I think the problem is you. Everything in the game makes sense, there is a nice mapping feature, and you can get hints if needed via your log book. This game provides hours of fun. For those who enjoy locked room style games, this is the perfect app for you.

B004FOA84A|3.0|Let me start by saying that this is a fun little game, but it is way too short. I easily beat it in under 45 minutes with no help at all. That's sad because it was fun and interesting - it just wasn't long enough! I'll keep an eye out for more games from this developer, though, because the graphics and puzzles were nice.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|Billy said it best in his recent interview with Consequence of Sound:<br /><br />\\"I'm just going to reach for what I know that I love, that I can feel. So if I'm playing a riff that sounds like Gish, great if it rocks. Who cares? Especially when you live in the circumstance like I do, where you have other bands, especially young bands, continually, that are very influenced by my band, that are contemporary. What's wrong with me being me? You know what I mean? It's like, \\"Ok, I'll be me, too.\\"\\"<br /><br />It's combined the best of a lot of the past albums and sets up the groundwork for albums to come. If you want a quick get to the chorus guitar rock album that you can instantly fall in love with go buy a Foo Fighters or Nickelback album - I prefer the challenge of each note and melody and thus far I have not been disappointed in this album.<br /><br />It's got some jammers, it's got some lul points but overall it's a band creating great music.

I was excited to see what would happen between Ana and Christian in this second installment of James' \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" trilogy.

I was excited to see what would happen between Ana and Christian in this second installment of James' \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" trilogy. Together, Ana Steele and Christian Grey experience some intense excitement, as well as some crazy highs and lows. This second story goes more into the secrets of the CEO and dominant, Christian Grey's, past. Ana was allowed some insight into his life and has to choose if she could still stay with this man that she loves even after learning what she did about him. Overall, I think \\"Fifty Shades Darker\\" is exciting and intense on many different levels. I would recommend this book to someone who is open minded and looking for a new branch of romance stories, like erotica.<br /><br />Christian Grey, and innocent, college graduate Anastasia Steele have an interesting relationship. There is a deep emotional and sexual connection between them.<br /><br />\\"He glances down at me, and it's there in the air between us, that electricity. It's palpable. I can almost taste it, pulsing between us, drawing us together.<br />`Oh my,' I gasp as I bask in the intensity of this visceral, primal attraction.<br />`I feel it, too' he says, his eyes clouded and intense.<br />Desire pools dark and deadly in my groin. He clasps my hand and grazes my knuckles with his thumb, and all my muscles clench tightly, deliciously, deep inside me.\\" (Page 14).<br /><br />Before meeting Christian, Ana was a virgin. Then after meeting Christian, Ana is all of a sudden swept up into his intimidating world of sex. And intimidating it is with all the whips and handcuffs and other unidentifiable objects. Ana wants to have \\"more\\" with Christian, not his usual Dominant and Submissive relationship. She tried the submissive thing for a bit, though she didn't sign the contract, but it just wasn't for her. Though when she left Christian she didn't realize how much she loved him until he was gone. The same happened for Christian-he realized he loved Ana. So, Christian and Ana came to an understanding that they will try a more normal relationship, as Christian would say \\"vanilla.\\" Maybe, as time goes on, Ana will allow Christian to spice up the vanilla sex, especially if he could learn to trust her.<br /><br />I think this book's title should be changed to \\"Fifty Shades of Wow.\\" Wow=Great in this case. I really liked this novel. The only reason that I am not giving it five stars is because it gets a little repetitive at times. BUT! I am not a writer whatsoever and I am not bad talking James' style in the slightest. I really enjoy her work, I do. But for example, every single time Ana and Christian have an orgasm together it's the same line of Christian calling out Ana's name. No big deal really, but I just wanted to throw that out there because sometimes that is something readers want to know. Like I said though, I give this book 4 stars and I also give the first book 4 stars. I am about to start reading the third book, \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\" and hopefully I think that book is at least 4 stars as well. I will definitely let you know when I do though!<br /><br />I found this book to be very exciting, unexpected, thrilling, and revealing. I also find it to be quite humorous at times. Ana and Christian both have a very dry sense of humor that I actually find refreshing. They enjoy each other's company so much, even if they are in the midst of an argument. This, yes, seems to happen a lot. But that is only because of how overprotective Christian is of Ana, and he has his own personal reasons of course. I also find it quite amusing when Ana refers to her inner goddess. She does this quite often throughout each book. She also refers to her self-conscious a lot too, but she is a lot more reserved and prudish than Ana's inner goddess who is sexy and needing.<br /><br />\\"He is gloriously naked. My inner goddess is doing a triple axel dismount off the uneven bars, and abruptly my mouth is dry,\\" (page 76).<br /><br />I know I already said this, but I just love this book! It's a fun book to read. Of course, yes it is an erotica, but I really enjoy the romantic parts of the story. I like when Christian opens up to Ana, and how they find comfort in each other's company. They have grown a lot together in this book, and I can't wait to see where the next book brings them!!<br /><br />Brianna Lee of Brianna Lee Book Reviews<br />[...]'s company so much, even if they are in the midst of an argument.

0385528752|5.0|I gave this book to a friend as a gift who runs a non-profit venture.  A note came back telling me how much he enjoyed the book and that he purchased copies for his entire executive management team.  The book is that good and that practical.<br /><br />Effecting positive change in an organization is the sine qua non for leaders in the modern age. And so the lessons are applicable to for-profit, non-profit, arts, and educational organization.  The book offers practical advice and examples that can be implemented the very next day. Highly recommended!
B000VSAEYI|3.0|My daughter LOVES this pool and I have to agree. She's 2 1/2 and it's just perfect for her. It was a great deal for all that it comes with (slide, floaty toys, sprinkler hook up). However, I'm sad to say that after only a week of mild use, it already has a small hole we cannot find. It deflates after a few hours so it's a huge pain to have to blow it up before each use. My daughter is very gentle with it, so it didn't come from \\"rough play\\". If the toy was more durable, it would be a five star product for sure!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|I have been on board since the Gish days.  Is the album as good as Gish, Siamese Dream, Mellon Collie or Adore?  No.  But this is a very solid album.  It is safe to say that this is best album written by Corgan since Adore.<br /><br />Pale Horse and Inkless are standout tracks.

B007N5YIUS|4.0|Even though I suck at this game it is quite fun..most of the time.I am sure there are secrets to playing that I haven't learned yet, but will keep shooting.
B007KDFWRG|2.0|Certainly NOT worthy of two CDs. Wandering, gap-filling solos. Non-headliner performances that could have been left off. Sort of an \\"excuse me\\" closing number with appropriately polite crowd applause. Yawn. If this was the cream of several nights recordings, they got issues. Can't hold a candle to older, historic live recordings. Sorry.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Think \\"Glengarry Glen Ross\\" scaled up and toned down.  Kevin Spacey is in both films, of course.  Paul Bettany, as the hotshot yet dissatisfied trading manager, looks like a young, twitchy Ed Harris.  Simon Baker, though not nearly as loud, is more than reminiscent of Alec Baldwin's character Blake.  Could just be my imagination though, as could this: Stanley Tucci, playing the sacked quant who first spots the financial blowup coming, closely resembles Nassim Nicholas Taleb, of Black Swan fame, who also predicted the 2008 crash.  Director and screenwriter J. C. Chandor was very clever to put these allusions into the film, if indeed he did.<br /><br />The superb ensemble acting is the main draw here.  Jeremy Irons fully redeems the cliched Slimey Limey villain role he's given.  Kevin Spacey is great as the seen-it-all veteran who discovers that he has not in fact ever seen anything like the looming catastrophe he must now manage.  Penn Badgley and Zachary Quinto do a fine job as the newbies who suddenly find themselves in deep water, Quinto to be promoted and Badgley to be canned.  I've seen Demi Moore in so many bombs, that it's very good to see her excel in a movie of substance here.  There is much peering into monitors, much side-eyeing around conference tables, many expressions of dawning incredulity--so much so that one YouTube remix has a scene with the dialog removed, only the reaction shots remaining.  Think what you will about the actual events depicted here, lovers of fine acting won't go wrong with this.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book just got added to my top 10 list of best books I've ever read.  Hard hitting reality.  The author has been through more than you can imagine.  Even if only half of what he writes about actually happened to him it's still an amazing story.  His writing style and well versed philosophy come across in a way that makes you not want to put the book down!  Excellent book!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I like a good book with romance, a little sex  Some of the sex scenes were a little gross.I just can't imagine having oral sex after riding on a plane all day without a bath first. And yes her orgasims got boring. As far as reading the 2 nd book,  I  think I need to read something that has quality to it . I was left thinking why waste my precious reading time on crap like this. This could have been a better book if writer wrote more like a great writer ,not a porn star with no substance in their head. .
1416955070|4.0|I have this problem when it comes to highly hyped things. I tend to not like them. I get this vision in my head of MAGIC, and then when whatever it is fails to completely knock my socks off, I feel let down. It happens with movies, books, TV shows...you name it, I have been disappointed by the overhyping in it.<br /><br />So I was a bit cautious heading into City of Bones. On the one hand, I like the premise a lot. Magic + city + all manner of beasties = GOOD.<br /><br />On the other hand, everyone loves it, ergo I will hate it.<br /><br />Hello, backwards logic. Fancy meeting you here.<br /><br />Anyway.<br /><br />I did not hate it. As a matter of fact, I rather liked it.<br /><br />I enjoyed Clary. She was spunky and resourceful and loyal. She had her moments of head-scratching stupidity, but they were infrequent. Overall, she had great development, she was likable, and I could understand why I was supposed to be rooting for her.<br /><br />Of course, as with many books that have a protagonist discovering all manner of interesting things about their own mysterious past, I found myself scratching my head sometimes and wondering, \\"How did she not figure this out already?\\" But the book actually explains why she's remained in the dark for so long, and it makes sense. There was one non-magic related development involving Clary that I saw coming from miles away, that she was completely oblivious to. It was kind of frustrating. But only kind of.<br /><br />As for the other characters, my favorite is Simon. I know, I know, it's supposed to be Jace. Everyone's favorite character is Jace. But mine is Simon. He's hilarious, he's smart, he's incredibly loyal, and he keeps trying to do the right thing even when no one has tried to do the right thing by him. Simon, you rock. I know you're the underdog and will probably get the short end of the stick in this series, but I'm rooting for you.<br /><br />Alec, Isabelle and Jace are also well-developed characters. They each have their own distinct personalities, they each grow throughout the course of the book, and I came to feel like I knew, liked, and mostly understood each of them.<br /><br />Then there's the matter of the story and the mythology. I thought Cassandra Clare did a great job of weaving together basically every fairy tale/paranormal story we've ever heard. Vampires, werewolves, demons, angels, fairies, elves, witches, monsters - they all make an appearance here, but it doesn't feel like you're just being pummeled with bedtime stories. I loved the creativity in constructing the world, and how the fantasy world was integrated into our own.<br /><br />And the story was great. A solid villain, a few mysteries to solve, some surprise discoveries, and a lot of action. I can see why so many people love this series so much, and I'm excited to see where it goes from here.<br /><br />No, I'm not ready to add it to my list of \\"favorites\\" yet, but there's still four books left in this series, plus two prequels. So who knows, maybe it'll get there one day. Part of the problem is that unlike most readers, I wasn't all that enamored with Jace, and he's one of the cornerstone characters of the book. I understood why he was the way he was, and his snark was amusing, but he just kind of got on my nerves. Too guarded, too untrusting. Yes, he had good cause, but it didn't make him a character I loved. At least not yet.<br /><br />And I still have a lot of questions, which was definitely intentional on Cassandra Clare's part. You're not supposed to walk away from City of Bones with all the answers. It sets up a series, and it does it well. But as a result, I didn't feel very satisfied when I finished this book. I prefer my \\"first\\" books -- even when there are many sequels to come -- to still leave me satisfied, with more answers than questions. And while I felt this book was highly enjoyable, I wasn't satisfied.<br /><br />I will definitely get to the rest of the books in the series - City of Ashes is next. It's a great premise and a fascinating world with likable characters, and I thought City of Bones was a good start. And now I can officially (at least in part) understand what the hype is all about.s is next.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" is not the kind of story that will make you ponder deep questions about society or enlighten you to a truth about humanity, but it is an enjoyable story if you are looking for a decent adventure. The characters are a bit one-dimensional and you don't seem to care if they live or die, but they are better than Bella Swan that is for sure! I hope the sequel develops the characters more.

This book is a  great read and a inspirational story all at the same time. Definitely recommended!

B004LWZW24|1.0|This movie was horrible, tasteless, generic, and just all-around bad, but to be fair, I've never even been able to finish it (due to falling asleep somewhere in the middle or turning it off in disgust). Perhaps the ending makes up for it all; although, I highly doubt it. It seems like the movie tried way too hard and uses every cliche horror movie scare tactic in the book. I'm sorry, but I see no hope for this movie, and if you're a true horror fan I wouldn't recommend this piece of garbage. If this scares you, you might as well not even touch any real horror movies. Stick to the new version of \\"horror\\".

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I love this soundtrack!  I bought it right after I saw the movie!  I can't stop listening to it!!  I also like it because I LOVE the music!  I know that the original recordings are, and always will be, better, but this is really good.  I do recommend that people see the movie first so, they can make their judgements on what they see in the movie and also if they like the covers of the songs.  I will say though, my least favorite song on the soundtrack is, \\"Undercover Love\\".<br /><br />As far as the singing by the actors, they do an excellent job!  Tom Cruise does a great job, and is a very good singer (as well as Julianne Hough, Russell Brand, Alec Baldwin and Catherine Zeta-Jones), on the songs he sings--he should do a good job on \\"Paradise City\\" considering the fact that his vocal coach for the movie was Axl Rose's vocal coach--(\\"Paradise City\\", \\"Wanted Dead or Alive\\", \\"I Want to Know What Love Is\\", \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\", \\"Here I Go Again\\", \\"Every Rose Has Its Thorn\\", \\"Rock You Like A Hurricane\\", and \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\").<br /><br />I will say that, you also have to like the music more than anything.  I'm a teenager and I love this kind of music--and any Classic Rock really--because it's that good!  I recomend this soundtrack and the movie!  But, like I said it's best to see the movie first--which is great if I haven't mentioned that already--to make your final judgements.  LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT!!!!

B00881VLCE|2.0|I have trouble with the puzzle staying in the middle of my screen. It will go off to one side or other making it hard to add pieces on the sides or top.  Sometimes,  the pieces just disappear.  I have the paid version and thought maybe it would be better,  but no. Would be much more enjoyable if glitches were fixed.<br /><br />08/23/12 App must have updated because the way you scroll thru the puzzles to see which on you want has changed.  In the process of the update, all of the puzzle packs I had downloaded (free & purchased) are no longer there.  If I try to download them, it says the download failed.  I can get new puzzles, but cannont get my old ones back.  Not Happy as I am out money for some of those packs. downgrade to 2 stars for this reason.

B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I'm not  a fan  of  many things , ok not a crazy  fan  of  many things  ,but  after I  heard Scott  Caan  was  being  considered  for this  show . I  admit  I  was excited . I am  a long  time fan  of  his and  his fathers . First  movie i  saw him in was Gone in 60 seconds .  The night this  aired  . I  got  DVR'd . But  From the first explosion to the  beers at the end  I'm not sure I  blinked at all.<br /><br />The location of the filming is so  beautiful , that I am  planning a trip to  Honolulu . I  didn't know  much about  Alex , tho  or  Grace , or  Daniel . But I  don't  need too. They  chemistry  of the cast  goes from off camera straight to  on camera .<br /><br />The loyalty  that  is  formed  right from the begining  of this  show  do to the characters need for something  to  hold on to is amazing . The smiles  even  if  scripted  are real . I  can't  say  how often  I've  been  in a bad mood and  looked up  on youtube  a clip from the show . Or  played the DVDs . The Banter  kills  me every time  it  just  doesn't  get  old . I  actually  think i  have stolen  a few lines  from the  show.<br /><br />Just  give it a chance  its  such  a great show!

B003O86FMW|4.0|At my 16 year old daughter's insistence I have read the trilogy and to my surprise found the books thought provoking and fascinating. As an adult I found the writing style adequate and the story excellent.
B007P6VLRS|1.0|I was at a friend's house when I first heard \\"Thirty-Three\\". Up until then I never really noticed the Pumpkins before. Sure I loved \\"Disarm\\" but never really thought to buy the CD especially since Gish was rather... Meh, just not for me but then I heard all of Mellon Collie and everything changed. An epic record that gave us so many gems including b-sides that held their own against any proper a-side release (\\"The Last Song\\", \\"Medellia of the Gray Skies\\") these songs are \\"made of stern stuff\\". Enter Adore and many many people were instantly turned off... but not me. I loved it. I got it. I listened to it along with Mellon Collie and a few off Siamese Dream. Again we were treated to some superb b-sides like \\"Once In A While\\" and \\"Czarina\\"... but then Machina happened and EVERYTHING after that. There may be some things that I'll pick off the solo record or the odd live performance by Billy but that's not the same. I had such high hopes for Oceania but it's nothing short of bland. Where's the risk in the songwriting? I realize that time is an enemy to several artists' creative output especially after success and self indulgence BECAUSE of success. Billy, risk everything! Adore Part Deux or Mellon Collier and the Infiniter Sadnesser... I don't know, I'm not good with titles! I'm being selfish but so what?!?! Do you realize how awesome it is to watch the reactions of people in a crowded bar when they hear \\"And into the eyes of the jackyl I say KA-BOOM!\\" booming out of the jukebox? It's awesome! It's what Oceania wants to be but isn't. Not even close.

0345803507|1.0|I read 1st book and thought it's not bad and quite interesting (ofcourse because of all the hot steaming intense sex describing)...2nd skipped alot of the sex scenes...3rd i find it boring and it seems the author has copied alot of writing ideas from the Twilight Saga series. I read the 3rd to satisfy my own curiousity of Christian's childhood, and also skipped alot of Mrs Grey's own thoughts and her lame conversations. How did these books become one of the best sellers! Bad writing, bad plot........ but this book should not be on the best seller list.....if you are curious about steaming sex parts, read the first book. My feeling after reading all three books is to feel empty nothing remained, nothing lingered. There you go.

0671027344|5.0|I had heard of this book a while back but overlooked it. Then, I recently saw the trailer for the movie version of this book. Therefore, I wanted to read it before the movie came out to compare it. It is the beginning of summer and I was coming out of a stressful year. I found myself at this party not dancing. Then I though, wow I must be a wallflower. I downloaded the book the next day on my kindle. I finished the book that same day. There are some things in this book like drugs I do not advise. However, what this book taught me was that you can't live your life being a wallflower. It has truly changed my outlook on some things. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK SO MUCH! YOU HAVE TO READ IT!
B000003TBP|5.0|In 1996, Beck Hansen released one of his biggest, and well known albums of his career Odelay. With such a short discography at the time of this release, it is very suprising how he released such a high quality album at that point. What is great about this album, as well as many other albums released by Beck is how it how it vibes so well, even with all of the different mood changes. Also a major plus is that this album journeys into different genres like with blues, funk, alt-rock, and hip hop. But no matter what Beck stays true to his style of music throughout his career, and it shows here on this album.<br /><br />I won't go into how great of this album is, as anyone can see from all the great reviews for this album here. Major standouts on this album starts from the beginning with \\"Devil's Haircut\\" to the well known \\"Where Its At?\\" where Beck has his saying \\"I got two turntables and a microphone...\\". Another great song on the album is \\"Novacane\\" as well as \\"Jack @ss\\". The latter song has a cool mellow kind of vibe that Beck's voice matches.<br /><br />Overall Odelay is a fantastic album that is great to enjoy. If you are new to Beck, I recommend you start with this one because this album is one of his best (as opposed to his depressing feelings style on his later albums), especially those who like artists who are as versitle as Beck was on this album. The album is very lively and theres hardly any dull moment here, and it is sure to keep your interest all throughout here.

0307386171|5.0|On Chesil Beach, a novella by Ian McEwan, is a burst of fresh air, a book that swiftly moves along and took my heart with it.<br /><br />Both virgins on their wedding night, Florence and Edward can only imagine what the evening will hold. They eat dinner in the honeymoon suite as they gaze out onto Chesil Beach. Florence tries not to think about what will soon happen; Edward hopes he'll know what to do and when to do it.<br /><br />The book, set in England in 1962, flashes back to when they met and how their love gradually blossomed. Although a university graduate, Edward's vocation was still illusive.  Florence, however, never doubted her choice as a professional musician. Their differences melt away as their love develops.<br /><br />Back to their wedding night, Edward anxiously begins to make love as he has so often fantasized. Florence, overwhelmed with this sudden closeness feels herself mentally backtracking. The inevitable plays itself out, but not as they expect.<br /><br />I found this small book haunting, yet filled with compassion. McEwan is a master at detachment while evoking intimate details. On Chesil Beach is a profound novel, a story that demonstrates that what isn't said can transform lives.

B007P6VLRS|5.0|First of all, I never give albums a 5 star rating. But, the exception here, is due to how utterly skeptical I was about whether bily was finished. I prayed for the day the Pumpkins would reunite, and much like every other fan, I pre-ordered the predecesor album \\"Zeitgeist\\" five years ago. I was utterly dissapoined. But, I must cut billy some slack there, after all it was seven years since Billy Corgan operated under Smashing Pumpkins, and as soon as the reunion secret was out, Billy was under tremedous pressure, to make a comback album. So in a way, did the media itself sabotage the Zeitgeist album? Perhaps, but still I will say I thought the album was extremely rushed, and therefore, the album failed to impress me. And Teargarden, the 44 song project, was in my opinion, a mere joke. So its not a secret I was very skeptical as to what Oceania was gonna be like. But, damn I popped oceania in my cd player, and I was litterally blown away.<br /><br />This without a doubt, is the best album in more than 10 years. The album pack the punch of Machina, and Mellon Collie combined. It has some reminisence of the Mellon Collie years, and gish's psychedelic sound. But yet, its impossible to compare this to any other album. Call me crazy, but this is truly a Smashing Pumpkins album folks. And yes, Im a die hard fan, I would not say this unless I truly believed it to be true. but damn billy, you pulled it off.<br /><br />Take my advice, buy this album. Its what weve waited for.

B007K3JFUQ|1.0|This review is instead for the physical product. As of right now I am filing a return for a second defective disc. Upon first playing the disc the previews all work fine, but as soon as the main menu tries to load up the disc stops playback altogether. I have tried all the menu buttons on my player and have only gotten past the error once, but upon trying again after stopping the film I cannot start playback again. Hopefully the publisher will be recalling the defective discs sometime soon but until then I will be getting my money back.

0345803485|4.0|Courtesy of Happy Endings Reviews<br /><br />Fifty Shades of Grey, pop culture phenomenon and hot topic book of the year, exploded on the scene early in 2012 after a fanatic online following turned into a cultural obsession. With a set-up eerily similar to its paranormal inspiration Twilight, Fifty Shades opens with college student Anastasia Steele, a fairly plain heroine whose inner voices, not-so-ingeniously named \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious,\\" become almost schizophrenic by book's end, meeting billionaire entrepreneur and god Christian Grey. An initial pull between the two quickly develops into strategic meetings as a fascinated Christian pursues an equally mesmerized Anastasia. But when worldly Grey unveils his secret BDSM lifestyle to virginal Ana, complete with confidentiality agreements, contracts, and a \\"Red Room of Pain,\\" she wonders what she's entered into and questions if they can really make a relationship work.<br /><br />Much like Twilight, it's a mystery exactly why this book became the widespread hit the way it did. Like Twilight, it's not the most exciting or creative plot. It's really not a novel concept, despite what a large population of the American public seems to think - erotic romance novels with a BDSM theme have existed long before Fifty Shades, and many are better written too. And certainly, certainly it's not the simple, silly writing that has made it stand out. The only conclusion is that James manages to spin that elusive magic that every romance author hopes for - pure chemistry between the lead couple. Christian and Ana's evolving, shifting relationship is the best thing about the book, and James was wise to center page after page with scenes between just the two of them.<br /><br />There's something to appreciate here for even the highest brow romance reader: Ana's vicarious innocence and Christian's overwhelming, all-consuming passion and intensity; sex scenes that were surprisingly emotional and delicious; and deeper than it may appear on first glance, that universal joy of watching two people with very different backgrounds and personalities navigate their way through that beautiful, raw process of falling in love. My favorite part of the book, the point where I knew it had worth, was the moment when Christian learns Ana is a virgin. The hardened man who swore he doesn't make love, who vows to keep emotional and even physical distance from his submissives, takes her hand and leads her to his own bedroom, where he tenderly loves her and stays with her all night. In a genre where there are simply countless \\"first times,\\" this one stands on its own as something really special and provides a real connection between the hero and heroine.<br /><br />That's not to say Fifty Shades can't claim its many, many faults. Ana is naïve, making her, at times, annoying. I could forgive her lack of strength as a character because this is journey that we take through her, a coming-of-age story of sorts, but more than that, she isn't fleshed out as well as her counterpoint. Christian Grey is one of those truly fascinating characters, a woman's fantasy and a psychologist's dream, and he tends to overshadow any other character in the vicinity, which isn't necessarily bad in literature, but is sorely noticeable in romance.<br /><br />The BDSM is stilted, with pages of contract and then an endless merry-go-round of discussion about what they want and what they need. And maybe it's not a very realistic representation of a BDSM relationship, maybe there's not enough incorporation of Dominant/submissive behavior, not enough play. But to an extent, that's the point: the central conflict is, can Christian and Ana forge their own rules, their own definition of a relationship with some amount of BDSM? It's an intriguing study of human behavior, and I enjoyed seeing a woman who isn't sure if she is at heart a submissive, who actually asks herself if, as much as she loves him, can she give him what he needs in this way?<br /><br />As much as you fall in love with Christian Grey, I couldn't help the nagging feeling that I would feel uncomfortable with him as Ana often does. He is very closed off and doesn't give answers even as he demands them from her. He too has a journey, and this is the crux of it, but I could sympathize with Ana's confusion. The concessions he does make, like quickly doing away with his rule of not staying the night with a woman, melt your heart. But he snaps and punishes and throws off mixed signals as much as he smiles and softens, and it's jarring. His punishments can be brutal, and I felt in this book that Ana gives more than Christian does. That is my issue with the power exchange here: I wasn't sure that Ana as the submissive really did hold all the power.<br /><br />However, Fifty Shades of Grey is a love story that got to me in that way that we always hope for, and I'm glad I'm not too cynical a romance reader that I can't still be influenced by the crowd.<br /><br />Series: Fifty Shades #1<br />#1 Fifty Shades of Grey<br />#2 Fifty Shades Darker<br />#3 Fifty Shades Freed

B002ZCDR88|5.0|This eclectic double disc is a masterful piece of artistry, with so many songs of various tastes and cultures, it is amazing that one artist could do it all.

B002L9N4DS|5.0|Forrest Gump is a landmark film, touching on many delicate aspects of human life, love and values. \\"Life is like a box of chocolate: you never know what you are going to get.\\" Oh so true! Fatalistic? Not really, as a strong implication of the movie is that you have to work hard at your life, no matter what you find in your box of chocolates.<br /><br />It is just a \\"feel good\\" movie as many have written? I don't think so, it goes deeper than that. And in fact it did not make me feel good at all. In the end I could not help but feeling angry at Jenny for what she did to Gump. Of course, most of us men have had our \\"Jenny\\" in our lives. Mine (now history, thanks God!) even looks like Jenny in the film!<br /><br />I could not help but smile at discovering that Bubba, the black shrimp fisherman in the movie, inspired a real company that is now very successful!<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc is very good, containing interesting interviews with Hanks and the director, as well as other \\"behind the scenes\\" material, including the making of special effects which were painstaking to produce and quite advanced for the time. The European version on sale on Amazon.co.uk is in English, French, Italian, German and Spanish, with subtitles in these languages plus all the Scandinavian languages.

Even the tutorial was pretty thorough on how to play (play it, not only does it show the basics of Mahjong but it shows how to use the controls, too). Music can get a bit annoying but otherwise it is a well designed game. If you love Mahjong then it is worth the five bucks. If you aren't sure there are other Mahjong games out there to cut your teeth on before risking five dollars on it.<br /><br />A keeper!
