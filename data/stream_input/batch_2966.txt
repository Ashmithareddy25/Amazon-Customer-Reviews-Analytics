B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I don't think anyone writes \\"gross\\" as well as Stephen King.  He just has ability  to get you to visualize a scene.  I'll get to the scene in a moment.  In Doctor Sleep,  he brings back the character of Danny Torrence, the little boy in The Shining.  In interviews King says that when fans ask about the fate of specific characters (the one's that actually live through the horror), he's been more interested in the those that question the fate of Danny.  I think most people who have seen the movie remember the cute little boy on a tricycle with a bowl haircut racing down the empty corridors of The Overlook Hotel.  Later to run from a mad \\"white knuckle alcoholic\\", his father<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is,  in my opinion, semi autobiographical.  Like Duma Key, which deals with the aftermath of a man who is in a horrendous accident (like King in real life), Doctor Sleep deals with the reality of a recovering alcoholic.  I didn't know King was an alcoholic, but he has been in recovery for over twenty years.  So he knows the depths to which one can plunge as well as the difficulties in trying to remain sober. In Doctor Sleep, Danny is an alcoholic like his father and a chain smoker like his mother (who, in the novel, has died of lung cancer). When writing the book, King's son, Owen, told him that the \\"plunge\\" he had given Danny, now Dan, was not far enough to equal the plunge Dan's father, Jack, had taken.  So, if you don't want gross, speed read ahead.  Dan, after having picked up a girl, gotten in a fight, spends all of his paycheck on cocaine, wakes up still drunk and has to go to the bathroom.  \\"Another lurch from his unhappy gut...That released all of the puke triggers: the vinegar smell of hard cooked eggs in a big glass jar, the taste of barbecue-flavored pork rinds, the sight of french fries drowning in a ketchup nosebleed.  All of that crammed into his mouth last night between shots.  He was going to spew...\\"  And that he does in spectacular fashion.  But that leads to the main reason for the scene...Dan's plunge.  As he's leaving the bathroom, out of another room comes a toddler with a baggy nappie full of everything a baby discards, sees the coke on the table, runs to it crying, \\"canny, mama, canny!\\"  Danny keeps him from  getting the \\"canny\\" and the little boy falls asleep with his drunk mother.  Danny notices bruises on the little boy's body. While the mom is passed out, he goes through her wallet taking all of her money.  Justifying this by saying she'd been the one who made him spend his paycheck on coke.  The taking of the money haunts Dan.  And the bruises on the little boy haunt Dan.  This, to me, is the real crux of this novel...the demons of a past life Dan can not seem to be rid of... his murderous, alcoholic father, the dead but not dead people from The Overlook who visit him leaving behind pieces of their rotting, putrefying bodies and the mother with her bruised baby boy.  Dan discovers \\"that memories are the real ghosts\\" and that, \\"you take yourself with you, wherever you go.\\"<br /><br />Of course in every King novel there has to be some type of supernatural forces causing havoc.  In this novel, we finally learn what \\"the shining\\" really is.  It's the ability to read other people's minds, or move objects, or project out of  one's self.  Dan has it and so does a young teenage girl named Abra.  And they have to battle a bunch of centuries old serial killers, the True Knot, disguised as RV driving pensioners who literally feed off the pain of others. They only feed on those with \\"the shining\\", and they make their deaths particularly brutal.  Makes for better \\"steam\\".  They get a big kick out of 9/11 and other tragedies.  The leader of this group, a woman named Rose, has a tusk.<br /><br />In Doctor Sleep, Dan fights his past with much greater dread and sense of terror than he does the woman with the tusk.  Dan does, through AA, \\"come to know a new freedom and new happiness.\\"  He also comes to realize that he \\"willnot regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.\\"  On a scale of 1-5, 5 being terrific, I would give it a 4 based solely on Danny/Dan's story.not regret the past nor wish to shut the door on it.\\"  On a scale of 1-5, 5 being terrific, I would give it a 4 based solely on Danny/Dan's story.

B007MJ9LA2|5.0|This is the best Santana album since the old days.  None of that guest star malarkey or cover band stuff.  Carlos plays good original tunes with a tight band the way it used to be. Carlos always sings through his guitar and never steps on anybody - a musician that plays with etiquette.  I am a huge fan and this one made me believe again.  Bill B
B00DJZR46G|2.0|Perhaps I do wrong in reviewing this without buying it, but from what I've head, this is not my cup of tea.  Elton just sitting at the piano playing moody ballads is not what put him at the top of the charts in the 70s.  Granted, at 66, Elton is not the showman he used to be.  Gone are his flamboyant outfits, way out glasses, platform shoes and most everything else we have come to associate with Elton John.  This is a new Elton, a softer Elton that harps back to his pre-fame days, perhaps even before he teamed up with Bernie.  It's interesting to hear Elton seemingly enjoying himself basically alone on most of the tracks, but I think hardcore Elton fans who recall his mad 70s days were hoping a return to that Elton to some degree.  At least that's what the album advertising seemed to suggest, but we certainly don't get that here.  I suppose contemporary Elton fans who like his stage shows might enjoy this, but those of us like me who want to see a return to that rocking Elton we remember from the 70s will be very disappointed here.  There is only one track, Kids In The Candlelight, that reminds me of that rocking Elton of the past.  As for me, I will continue to turn on and rock to one of his classics from his glory days.  Hey Elton, how about releasing a re-mastered version of Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, perhaps with a stripped down version of Bennie And The Jets without Gus' simulated live recording???  That would surely get my attention into a record store for sure, not this new effort.

B00BWWS81S|5.0|Buy KT's album and press the button for repeat and listen over and over again.  It grows on you very quickly.  Pure KT with a little orchestration here and there.  Her voice is in top form, so expressive and in tune, her guitar playing is in the pocket, so supportive of the tune, and often underrated.  All the hooks are there, the melodies are pristine, only stripped down, probably much as she wrote them.  The tunes are not overproduced and thickly layered, almost a minimalistic approach.She has bared her soul here and given us the privilege to look in.  We've all been there-dealing with some of those issues she is tackling.  Bill B.

B00E9P959O|5.0|Wow, it IS possible for Rush to have a modern, progressive sound like Tool or Porcupine Tree. Bottrill proves that point by taking one of the most emotional, brilliant Rush CDs \\"Vapor Trails\\" that was plagued by horrific mastering. For over a decade, fans have been denied the ability to take songs like \\"Earthshine\\" and BLAST them through their headphones or speakers. Now, we can... ;)<br /><br />Thanks to Alex in particular for turning a train wreck into a masterpiece. I hope they use Bottrill for any future recordings. While I like the sound on \\"Snakes..\\" (not a fan of the material) and \\"Clockwork\\" (awesome material - great / not incredible mastering), Tool and PT have, IMO, FAR better mastering (\\"In Absentia\\" by PT) is an example of what Rush _could_ sound like. Tool has always sounded amazing. Anyway, today is a great day.<br /><br />VT has finally been liberated.

B009NNMB70|5.0|Being a fan aside, I can't think of any major criticisms for this movie. It took the time to focus on each of the boys as well as the group as a whole. There was also excellent concert sequences and the quality was excellent. It came off as real and leaving the theater, I honestly felt like I understood them much better, and I felt closer to them and their music as a result.<br />The boys are incredible, and so was this movie.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I feel like I live in Broadchurch and know these people. This series draws you in and holds you close. Who is the murderer? It turns out that even the actors didn't know. Any of them might be the killer.<br /><br />There's something about the way that this series is filmed, with minimal sound editing, or perhaps maximal sound muffling, that makes your ears focus on the sparse words of the actors and sounds in the room.<br /><br />The acting is great. In episode 1, I was a bit overwhelmed by the wide cast of characters but they soon sorted themselves out.<br /><br />And they're all suspects.

B004BUGCRK|5.0|When this album came out, I read a review on an online music publication which included a long preface detailing why the article's author was not a Sting fan. For that writer (and various people I've met through the years), Sting's solo career is synonymous with staid, bland, inoffensive, middle-of-the-road pop music rather than with vitality and creativity. It's unfortunate that many people view Sting this way. Although the charms of Sting's music are subtle, I have never been able to see Sting as anything other than a very authentic, talented artist who follows his own path (and as a consequence seems to enjoy mass appeal).<br /><br />I think my starting point with Sting was hearing classic Police songs like \\"King of Pain\\" on the radio during my childhood in the 1980s. Although by high school I was listening to then-popular grunge rock as well as punk & metal, it was songs like \\"King of Pain\\" that really stuck with me and to which I returned as an adult. I guess it was all just music to me, and to this day I enjoy a wide variety of styles from polished classic rock to raw rock n roll, folky stuff, jazz, \\"world\\" music, etc. etc. etc. I appreciate Sting as an artist and don't concern myself with whom the other fans might be.<br /><br />All that said, as a Sting fan, I enjoy this recording immensely. The depth added by the string section is a treat to my ears and brings out new layers and details that I hadn't previously picked up hearing the studio versions of many of these songs. The story-songs, even the ones I enjoy less than the others (\\"All Would Envy,\\" for example), are given greater weight and drama by the broader range of instrumentation. His classics from Ten Summoner's Tales shine brightest, as well as the stunningly powerful rendition of \\"King of Pain\\" (my favorite of all of Sting's songs) which I had on repeat for a week after I first heard it. Sting's personal interludes are also a welcome addition, adding context and a warm honesty to the performances. Overall there is a sense of renewed vitality here, a kind of quiet excitement about these renditions that hovers behind each performance. I know I will be listening to this one for many years to come.<br /><br />If you are a Sting fan, I highly recommend this set of songs. For those of you who may be more skeptical, please give this a try without preconceived notions. You may be pleasantly surprised.Overall there is a sense of renewed vitality here, a kind of quiet excitement about these renditions that hovers behind each performance.

B00CKR63F2|5.0|Set in Yosemite Park, among enchanted nature and the world of Native American legends, this story is mystical, mythical, and magical. At the beginning of this beautiful novel, Oria, the young protagonist, turns eighteen.  And that's when she learns of all the latent powers she is now gaining and is expected to master: her ability to shape-shift, the power of love, and the force of her own changing identity.<br /><br />The idea of constantly changing one's identity resonates with most people, as we are always trying to redefine ourselves and find our place in the world. But this idea is especially relevant for teenagers, the intended audience of this novel.  In real life, a teenager doesn't have to be a shape-shifter to feel what Oria feels. Teenagers' lives are always in flux, always adjusting to change, physical, mental, and emotional - and these are all the changes Oria is experiencing as well.<br /><br />Through the Bridalveil Fall, Oria enters the magical world of the Ahwahneechee tribe, a world filled with magic and ancient legends. To survive and thrive in that world, she needs to use her grandparents' wisdom (a great message for today's kids, by the way!), their experience, and her own judgment. Oria becomes the Golden Queen Fairy of the Bridalveil Fall, and that honor comes with a lot of responsibilities and inherent dangers. Oria's character is interesting and well-developed, and so is the setting of this story. The setting of Yosemite Park is described so vividly and in such a realistic way, that I felt like I was experiencing its magic with the characters.<br /><br />Even if you don't normally read fantasy, you will enjoy this book, if only for its tremendous wealth of Native American legends and beautiful descriptions of an enchanted setting. And if you plan to visit Yosemite, reading this book before the trip will create a magical vacation experience for you. Very well-done!!

I enjoy the Percy Jackson Series and thought I would check this series out to tide me over until the next Percy Jackson book came out.<br /> The halfhearted plot just didn't catch my interest. The characters were okay, a little on the bland side but with definite personality traits and depth.  The story was average.  I didn't feel the bad guy was very effective.  He just kind of popped in, gave generic bad guy threats and left.<br /> I was disappointed with the whole thing and didn't move on to the other books in this series.  I will keep waiting for Percy to come back, and simply forget about these books.

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|I have not written a review before but I was so pleasantly surprised by this one I thought I would make my first.  I won't go into details about the book because others have already done it, and probably better than I could anyway.  What I will do that I like to see in some reviews is tell you who I have enjoyed reading so you can see if my tastes run in line with yours.  I would put this guy in line with Peter V. Brett's demon cycle books, Patrick Rothfuss' Kingkiller Chronicals,  Brent Weeks Night Angel and Black Prism.  I have read a lot of others like Terry Goodkind, Terry Brooks, Robin Hobb, Jim butcher and R.A. Salvatore and have enjoyed them as well but Peter Brett, Patrick Rothfuss and Brent Weeks feel similar to Anthony Ryan to me.  This author has now made my list for someone to watch out for and purchase a new book automatically when it comes out.  If you like the authors I listed I doubt you will be dissapointed.
B009AMAGXK|4.0|Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich) has dreams about a mysterious girl that may be the death of him. Then one day she turns up in school to be Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert) the latest generation of the towns founding family.<br /><br />Mysterious things happen and no one is who he/she seems to be. Mostly this is a spooky story about destiny and bullying. O.K. maybe a sappy love story.<br /><br />This is a fun formula movie with no real surprises.

B00BWYFTNG|5.0|For anyone who missed grabbing a Daryl Dixon figure from the series 1 release, this is a great and affordable way to get the figure. You won't be able to find a series 1 Daryl figure for under $150 at this point so this is a great buy. The series 1 release of Daryl came with squirrels that he had hunted for dinner, this 2-pack does not come with those as he did in series 1, but he does come with prison keys. That is the only difference from the series 1 Daryl to this Daryl in this 2-pack. Also, the paints apps are much improved over the series 1 Daryl who had some pretty sloppy paint apps. McFarlane seems to have rectified that problem this time around. Also, I really like how slim the box is for this 2 pack, only about 2 inches thick which is great as most manufacturers tend to make obscenely large boxes and this takes up very little room.<br /><br />The only difference from the series 3 Merle to this 2-pack Merle is the color of his shirt. The single issue series 3 Merle has a white shirt, this Dixon Bros 2-pack has Merle in his black shirt. Other than that, the accessories and figure are the same. The box art, the presentation all looks very nice. I am now looking forward to the new Daryl Dixon and Motorcycle boxed set coming out in March of 2014 even more so after seeing the great job McFarlane did with this box set.<br /><br />For anyone who already got the series 1 Daryl and series 3 Merle, you may want to skip on this if you can't find it for under $30 as you aren't getting anything too exclusive other than some prison keys and a different colored shirt for Merle. For hardcore collectors or anyone who missed out on getting Daryl can now finally get him at a reasonable price.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|What a fantastic read! It keeos you guessing and I enjoyed the connections between the characters.  There is a very good twist.
B005FNUQK6|4.0|This is great jazz, but I should not be the judge. I love the song &#34;Seven Seas&#34;, play it over and over .Avishai Cohen is a great bass player , but the guy on the piano is just as good, the drummer is superb. This album sorta flys me out of my head.
B00E9P959E|4.0|When I got this i was expecting a gate fold with tons of artwork from the album but instead the two vinyl lp came in a flimsy album cover that when you take the records out it is so thin it is like paper WOW.  I expected more from Rush since they came from the hay day of vinyl records...
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game its off the chain whoever did this game is awesome I hope that they get a raise.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could not put it down. Absolutely mind blowing<br />Don't let the size of the book put you off. It goes so fast<br />Since I can relate to both time frames it was a fabulous blast of the past
B009KS4XRO|4.0|really fun to play. the more you play the more credits you earn. some timesit takes a while to build credits but it is a great game.
B00CPTUNBK|4.0|I was amazed that this movie stayed true to the feel of the show. It wasn't the best movie on earth, but it is still quite good.
1451695195|5.0|I always wondered about what happens in the near death experience and had my questions.  This book is beautiful,<br />describes in detail and will change your life. Yes, there is &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34;
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'd give this piece of crap no stars of I could. How anyone can think this piece of ridiculous fan fiction is literary greatness is beyond me. And too all those women who think this thing is the greatest thing ever please realize you're reading the equivalent of porn.
1451696191|5.0|I picked up this book because it was on the shelf of recommended reads at my library in honor of banned books week. As a teacher of teenagers and myself a one time teenager, I loved this book. I am nothing like Charlie, but his voice was authentic and I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know all the characters in Chbosky's book. I haven't seen the movie and probably won't see it now, but it was a great read and I am so disappointed that it is all over now.
B008Y212PI|5.0|fantastic<br />fantastic game. fun two way puzzle games.logic use is good thing to have.fun fun fun.try it.fun gamejust when you solve one another appears! try this game!!!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|best movie i have seen in a long time. telling everyone to watch it.love love love this movie.will watch it again
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|Found this game while looking for a hidden object game.  Have enjoyed this surprise very much.  Graphics are clear and colorful.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was going to buy a blu-ray player with Netflix and You Tube installed on the machine. I dreaded getting all the wires and connections going, and then I ran across Chromecast while surfing one evening. I ordered one, hooked it up in five minutes, ( OK, maybe 10 minutes, but it took me a while to find my wifi password ) reactivated my Netflix account, and started watching the complete Mad Men series from episode one. Picture and sound quality are great (1080 TV ) I have since ordered two more for my golfing buddies, and they worked very well. Easy to connect, easy to \\"cast\\" a wonderful little gadget. I love it!
B00E9P959O|5.0|9.999 out of 10 stars.. This is REALLY worth the 9 bucks they're asking. You get to hear things on the album that weren't there before or buried. Some big surprises I won't spoil for people who haven't heard it yet. It's so worth it to not expect it and then hear it happen! Why did I knock off .001 of a star? Personal choices of vocal takes used as opposed to the original. A bit too much use of delay on the vocal at times, but that may have been necessary. The first mix had no room to breath, this one does, and sonically is very pleasing especially considering what David Bottrill had to work with from the original recordings. Thanks so much Rush for spending the time and money on this, They didn't need to. Vapor Trails was a \\"meh\\" recording of a great collection of songs, Now it's a great Album (CD)overall.I REALLY recommend buying this. Kudos to amazon for including an \\"auto rip\\"
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|My kids and I love it! It's funny and lots of fun. We can not wait for more Angry Birds.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I am not that thrilled with it.  I can't seem to keep in going in the same direction, it keeps going upside down each time I open it to play.  I would like to know how I can keep it from doing that then I would be able to give you a better answer.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|This will live in the annals of movie history as one of the worst movies ever made.  Horrible, horrible, horrible.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|This movie is a classic Ben Stiller. It is a good movie that is very funny. If you're looking for a comedy, look no farther.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is very fun and I love playing it all the time it is so much fun that I'm addicted to it now
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The show has a great cast of characters. Great story lines and plot twists. Looking forward to season 3. Wish I got HBO.
B006GKHE6G|5.0|Kids love it.  We were pleasantly surprised how much our kids ranging in ages from 8 to 14 enjoy it, girls and boys alike.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Not as good as Nine and 1/2 weeks but a good read.  Will read the next one in the series.
B006O6F932|4.0|I had amazon credit to purchase this. The house is bigger than I thought and I wouldnt recommend for smaller children who will not take care of their things. This product needs to be used cautiously so it wont break. Amazon also has the best pricing for this item. $10 cheaper than anywhere else that I searched as well as free shipping. It is a good deal.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book made me really think about what teenagers go through. A must read for every parent, teacher or anyone who is around teenagers on a daily basis<br />  Writing was done in an enjoyable manner as to tackle such a sensitive subject. Couldn't put it down.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|keeps my kid busy for hours on end. Need to get some shopping done give this to your kid while in the cart will keep them busy so you can get your stuff done.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|This is one of the better free apps I have used. Very few advetisments and very challenging to play each successive level.
B008JFUR10|5.0|Giant Robots fighting Giant Monsters. That's all that needs to be said. Even with the sterotypical characters they work well and unlike most other blockbusters that aren't Marvel related (Bayformers, to name a few) the characters have a soul, and there's no needless crude and Sexual humor added in just because.<br /><br />If you didn't see it in theaters, buy it when it comes out on home video, you will not be dissapointed if you like Giant Robot and Giant Monster movie action.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My kids and I like this app. We wish there were more rooms! Some of the rooms are really difficult!
B009G41CG2|4.0|The one down side to this game is that they do not give you any hints and finally tell you when the game is over.  I guess it<br />is more of a challenge.  But I would like to be able to move the tiles more.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Excellent game, love it, really good games , make sure you download it, lo e the free credits every day, great fun
B00CD4RPWM|5.0|My only decline would be that print size is too small for Kindle version. I would recommend hard  version.<br /><br /> hard cover.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I am an avid fan of mahjong and have played games on many versions. This one is easy to use on the kindle and the star scoring makes me want to better my time on each game.  Definitely recommend!
B00BC24NT4|2.0|Confused and hard to follow what the story really is.  Ends abruptly without really winding up the story.  Hard to follow .
B008Y212PI|4.0|It's okay, had fun playing it. I would not pay much for it because it was short but the game is refreshing.
B007OWRBJK|1.0|I tried reading the first few pages and was bored beyond words. I did not enjoy this book at all. Very disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is very fun and addictive. A must have for your game collection and what price is better than free.
0679731725|5.0|I won't add to the many reviews of high praise for this book, other than to be another person out there vouching for the brilliance of this book.  First of all, this is not (as many would assume) some dry and dated English type book.  But rather it's a magically well written book, very smooth to read, that touches on the many facets of... life.  Highly recommended to all.  It's difficult to explain, but trust me, just read this book.  By the way the audiobook version also gets 5 stars;  very well read.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I highly recommend Downton Abbey!  It is an amazingly well done historical, fictional drama! Try it and tell your friends too!
B004YXE438|5.0|I got this as a free app of the day, and it is awesome!  Once I got custom images working, the time I spent on this webt through the roof!
B00AQCMK32|5.0|This game is cute, quirky and a lot of fun. I've done three playthroughs already and am amazed by how much time I end up spending on it. It's incredibly addicting and I often find myself hanging on to produce &#34;just one more game.&#34; I do agree with some reviewers that say that later in the game it becomes very easy to get games that place in the hall of fame, to the point where you don't even really have to try anymore. That's when you need to shift your goals. I still have yet to get a game that scores a perfect 40 points and then there's always the goal of trying to beat your high score from the last playthrough. That's really what the game is about at that point.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|I absolutely love this game! It's fun and addicting! Plus, the music is cute and I never get tired of hearing it. It gets a little tough as you go on, but I enjoy a challenge.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So many of our friends had watched Downton Abbey, so my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We are hooked, and so thankful to have found it on Amazon Prime!!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book had me hooked as soon as I started reading.  I love that death is the narrator.  What an unusual point of view!  My favorite relationships were the ones between Leisel and Rudy and Leisel and Hans.  My book club all loved this book.  We also liked how it told us what happened to all the characters, even the minor characters.  I could picture the town and all the inhabitants in my mind.  Great book.  I highly recommend it.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Game is stingy on bingos..must connect to facebook and friends to complete rooms..powerups expensive to buy..tournaments often freeze my kindlefire
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I love this app except on the first kindle fire you cant have more than two fingers on the screen so the blood stopping level I always lose. Other than that its amazing because the plane level can be turned off in the settings<br />:D
0425267695|5.0|What is amazing to me, is that it took so long for a publisher to pick this book up.  The story and characters are fascinating. Anthony Ryan had published it in 2011 via Smashwords I think, so I may have had it for more than a year on my reader. I picked this up when it was either free or very cheap in a digital format. Several times I started to read it but stopped to read something else before I reached the 2nd chapter.  I almost deleted it from my reader a couple of times. I AM VERY GLAD I DIDN'T! When I finally ran out of reading material from the many series I am following, I was debating on rereading some books or look for something new. Another author I like very much, Michael Sullivan, recommended Blood Song, by Anthony Ryan.<br /><br />I downloaded the sample and began to read and realized I already had the whole book with a different cover picture in my reader.  This time I read Blood Song and did not stop.  After the first 2 chapters I COULD NOT STOP! The only problem I had with it at first was the changing of time and point of view at intervals which caused the flow of the story to be choppy but it doesn't take away from the story. In fact, it helped to give the central character, Vaelin Al Sorna more depth.<br /><br />This is an amazing story with a charismatic central character. I think all lovers of fantasy books should read Blood Song.
B0091QSNEE|4.0|Was happily surprised with how engaged my toddler was and how much he's learned from this game. He's eager to get in the kitchen for real now.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie was an excellent take on the antebellum south, showing things we don't often want to talk about in America- but while it is food for thought after the movie ends, while it is running, it's mostly just a fun action western.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|This was the first book I have read that was by Craig Johnson, since then have ordered another one and I thought it was a great read.  I enjoyed the banter between the different characters and it was just a great book.  Looking forward to more books
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King. It gave good closure for Danny. opened up new roads for Abra. Good book if I may say so.
0061743526|5.0|Although I have seen the movie several times and love it, the book brings a better understanding and detail than the movie had given me.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a Free game! You can't beat the price. It's a very fun game to play with grandkids, and we all liked being able to add new colors to draw with.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Violence not usually thing but amount and degree was properly balanced  for story line. Acting was good<br /> Will probably watch again.
B004YXE438|5.0|Like many puzzles in HOG. Varying degrees of difficulty add interests. Was FAOTD but I would definitely recommend for purchase.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|As with another notebook item I tried, there is no direction on how to use the app. I would not recommend it.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|I just can't stop smiling, I am so happy I am finally listening to the album! It's been slow going because I have already had to repeat tracks such as Glory and Gore, Team, and Buzzcut Season. I am a pretty articulate fellow, but I feel at a loss when attempting to explain Lorde's impact on me internally. I have been listening to everything I had the opportunity to for about six weeks as I awaited Pure Heroine's release. I haven't been this moved by an artist since I discovered Metric in '09. I listen to a ton of great music, but this artist just resonates with me viscerally and this album is just more of the same for me. Buy this album, you won't regret it.
B000W7S44A|5.0|John Le Carre is masterful and this novel is a classic. In reality, he spent time working as an intelligence agent/spy with M15 and M16 for the British government. I have just read it a second time and it completely holds up. Set in cold war England and Germany. This is one of the best books I have ever read.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Great Show. If You Don't Start With The Ninth  doctor, You Are Missing Out. Love Love Love Love This Show.
B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|Khaled Hosseini brilliantly weaves together the lives and stories of his characters. Share this book with anyone who has enjoyed any of Hosseini's past novels.
B005K17RU0|4.0|handy to use when wondering what the weather will be like at home or at my cottage.  If I remember correctly, the radar maps show what the storms WERE doing, but not what we can expect in the future.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|I was a little disappointed to find that this book has the formulaic nature of a high school research paper. Make a claim, list three things, and then conclude with &#34;and that is why &#60;claim here&#62;&#34;.<br /><br />Isaacsons voice despite that isn't bad and the wealth of information he managed to pull together is a feat in and of itself. He accurately and unapologetically described Jobs' less-than-ideal qualities but not without unbalancing the biography with the extreme nature of his praise for Jobs.<br /><br />All in all I enjoyed the read but thought that some more care could be put into the actual writing itself.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Engaging, entertaining, and time well spent. An appropriate finale to a very worthwhile trilogy for all to enjoy and read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story is awesome! I could hardly put it down, and have already told all my friends about it! I think I will have all of the series read before too long.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|the file explorer seems to work well for my Kindle Fire.  I don't know why there wasn't one on the device when I purchased it.
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|The game looks great, is easy to play because of the layout and zooming and &quot;note&quot; taking. Music is good, not distracting or annoying.<br /> Modes for any age and experience. Overall very well done.
B000HZCZZ6|5.0|If you're a die hard, then you've got to see this.  If you like sci fi, but aren't a trekkie, you'd like it if you like pg movies.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game instantly became a favorite game! its addicting but my kindle over heats while playing..I love it so much!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook keeps you<br /><br /> in contact with family & friends plus I play a lot of my games here. Glad my daughter set it up for me.
B007SGM084|5.0|Awesome.  Will read them again soon. Highly recommend the trilogy. Will read anything else written by James.  Try them.  You will not be disappointed.
B000I3UMLQ|4.0|This is an interesting movie, not the nest of the bunch, but a good continuation for the original cast movies.
B00DMEQP46|1.0|I don't often write a review for anything, but have to say this album is historically bad. And I really like the first 2 albums. Don't know where they are going with this one.
0671449028|1.0|Who exercises after taking a bath?<br />I'm not exactly sure why it bothers me so much, but everyone takes a bath together too. I know it's just a kids book but it's awkward.<br /><br />A friend gave me this book and it's a good thing, because I would NEVER buy it.<br />Even just for kids books, we can do better than this.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|This book was certainly not my cup of tea.  While I consider myself \\"well-read\\" I had not read any of Neil Gaiman's work before this.  Despite not liking the story almost from the beginning, I kept reading to the end and was rather relieved when the book was done. Although I wouldn't recommend buying the book, others may want to read a borrowed version and make up their own minds.  It clearly has run the gamut of stars.
0762451319|5.0|Its a small box with small items. Which arrived in perfect conditions unlike the ones in some reviews I read. I personally love the necklace because it hang right around my collar bones.<br />The rest of the items are really cute in an small-I-only-paid-like-$10-for-this way<br />The necklace is a nice gun metal color. Loved it so much I put it on right away
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This is the first of Nicholas Sparks books that I've read but it won't be the last.  It is so well written and I could totally get lost in it.  The twists and turns of the story kept me turning page after page.  Sparks is definitely a good storyteller!  I normally don't read romance novels but this had more depth to it than a typical love story.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I bought this book on accident and ended up really enjoying it. Not my typical read but loved the characters and couldn't put it down.
B00BMNM4H6|5.0|This is my filler spot.  I wrote it all in the title.  Really loved this!  Quick and challenging.  Much fun.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Fifty shade of Grey tries to be a love story, but never really gets there. The sex, though graphic, is more pornographic than erotic , although it did not offend me in fact, if were not for the sex there would be absolutely no content to the book.  The premise is weak, really, a 22 year old virgin who has never even touched herself? The writing is sophomoric and the personality of Anasatsia, the main character is moronic, wanton, to a degree, but truly moronic and unbelievable.<br />The end is terrible, even knowing that there is a sequel (which I definitely won't be reading) it as though the author simply tired of writing at that point and stopped.  Glad she did.
B002UTKSBK|5.0|The movies are awesome, and so is the music.  The music stands well on its own, but is even better as a part of the movies.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game. It is challenging but not overly hard. Very easy to use on the kindle fire HD.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|lots of ability to read how, when, where, or whatever i am at<br />good variety of translations as well<br />i
B008KGPEQG|5.0|I heard this book reviewed and discussed by author Paul Auster on NPR.  He was so charming and funny and sensitive I had to read it.  It is a heart warming story of one man's life just his life, but he says the things that as we grow older we all think about. He is funny, intelligent, charming and sometimes raw.  It is a beautiful story and such a well written book.<br />I loved it. I would love to meet the author and tell him how much pleasure his life gave me.
140006922X|5.0|Of course, I saw the Fox interview....but I learned so much more about the times and places Jesus grew up in then I ever did by going to Church or reading the Bible.  Trust me, I went to Catholic school for 12 years - this book is simply amazing.
B00CA4S43O|5.0|So glad they finally put this out.<br /><br />The sound on the vinyl is spot-on. Can't be happier with the quality, I just wish we had a complete score and double vinyl. But this will more than do.
B00DMM3WVM|2.0|was fun<br />for about the first 5 minutes<br />then it got repetative<br />and lost the 'umph' it had in the beginning
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Great book, can relate to some events in it , at first I wish it would have ended different but then I ended up liking the end!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is AMAZING you need it.it's honestly one of the best apps you could ever have .thank you . The app keep s me really entertained
B005H9B44A|4.0|What more can be said about a mythical warrior God than this film manages. Entertaining and fun with a sense of humor. Well worth the time invested.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|what a FUN game<br />great idea<br />lots of puzzles to figure out<br />all around a fun little game to play
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I think the right type of ten year old would love this book, I am 67.  I bought the book because I liked American Gods and the summary on Amazon said this was not a children's book - wrong
B00499NHLC|5.0|I gave him 5 stars it takes a bit getting into being from England but for a monderen day Sherlock and Dr. Watson you will enjoy it. They just take his older stores and bring them up to date. If you like or love Dr. who you will enjoy this. I just wish there were more to watch and free ones at that when you can catch them on cable and save them when you can.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|George Clooney is unbelievable.  The music is great.  The way Homer's classic 'Odyssey' was cast into the rural South in the early 1900s is brilliant.  And John Goodman as the Cyclops is not to be missed.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|seemed fun<br />and WAS fun at the beginning<br />then just got repedative<br />and was the same thing<br />over<br />and<br />over
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|I loved the book and I think the movie is even better.  The book tells its stories in discrete chapters.  The movie interdisperces all seven stories and switches from one to the other with great ease and better effect.  I am not sure how easy the movie would be to follow if you had not read the book.  All the major characters play multiple roles which is a lot of fun to identify
B004VN39YG|4.0|I had to watch for a nursing paper.  the main character was a great patient.  not a country music fan but i liked the singing.
B006215P8I|4.0|I didn't like how we already knew what was going to happen..... but It was still interesting!!!! Just wish it had the better storyline of 1 2 and 3!
B00CATONCA|5.0|My husband told me to buy myself something different for my birthday. I love the walking dead tv series so I started searching that and I came across this dvd set collectible box. It is so neat! The heads hang on a lip so they look like the float. It even comes with little tiny pieces of fake skin that lay on the bottom. I filled it up with water and it held water for a week with no leaking. Super cool!!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I loved playing this game, it was well made and had a good story. I don't even mind that 4.99 price tag attached to all of the G5 games because they are all so great
B008220D5K|5.0|This Is 40 is a terrific and hilarious movie.  I love the slow-paced nature of the storyline that is probably intended to build really offensive -though often times sincere and realistic- stories involving a man (Paul Rudd) and his wife (the GORGEOUS Leslie Mann).  What makes this movie sort of unique is the offbeat nature of Leslie Mann.  She's the one who makes this movie so great.  The other actors and actresses are really solid, but it's Leslie that stands out the most.  She's also the one who receives most of the attention.  Her character always comes across so carefree and honest, and when someone disagrees with something she says, she will either calmly disagree by starting a small argument and expressing a smarmy remark which is a surprising and unpredictable personality change, or in the case of the little Tom Petty-resembling boy who was harassing Leslie's daughter and calling her names, she might explode and become angry and threatening.  Basically Leslie has a hidden dark side and it doesn't really become apparent until someone makes her upset, and her way of getting upset is strange to say the least.<br /><br />This movie is honestly not *that* much different from how many families nowadays function.  You may think This Is 40 is unrealistically warped, and don't get me wrong it is, but besides the oldest daughter exploding and tossing out several F words in one particular scene because she's tired of her parents fighting all the time, many of the events here are pretty realistic and likely to actually happen.  The youngest daughter questioning inappropriate words she hears for the first time and wants to know what they mean?  Yes, if you have even a little bit of experience with kids, you'll know this happens quite often- they will overhear adults using a bad word and wonder what it means so you have to disguise the actual meaning in some way.<br /><br />Life At 40 is basically an exaggerated take on the typical American family, I think.  Not much different from my family in fact.  Perhaps the character of Melissa McCarthy playing the role of the mother of the son I mention in the first paragraph, and not liking the way Leslie threatens her son, or the way Paul Rudd acts towards her son either, resulting in Melissa exploding in a fit of swear-happy rage in the principal's office... this is probably the low point of the film and a clear example of an unrealistic exaggeration, though I laughed all the same (especially when they deliberately exaggerate it even MORE during the end credits).<br /><br />The flow of the film is that you're encouraged to be patient so you can really absorb all the lines and plot points and figure out where this film is going, though it's entertaining along the way so no worries there.  Admittedly the film is probably 20 minutes too long so you can skip some parts without missing anything crucial.  It's not really a movie that demands 100% of your attention, but don't miss *too* much.  Another memorable character is the one played by Megan Fox.  Let's just say, she does *other* escort-related things besides harmlessly work at a boutique store, and another woman who works there played by Charlyne Yi is REALLY funny for how unintentionally obnoxious and UN lady-like she is, haha.  She's not much different from Leslie Mann's character actually.<br /><br />The party at the end pretty much blends all the characters together, or at least most of them, and it sort of gets confusing by this point.  Leslie and Paul's parents/grandparents/relatives are all sitting around a table having a conversation and I sort of got lost trying to figure out who exactly is who and what's going on with the story.  Small issue there since this only adds up to about 10 minutes of overall film time.  Also, throughout This Is 40, I found myself sympathizing with the youngest daughter the most.  Not sure if the movie writers were aware of the impact it had, but the way she portrays a frightened/confused child placed ina situation surrounded by constant fighting is VERY realistic.  No child wants to hear their parents fighting because, to a child, it means they fear the worst such as the possibility of a divorce.  The movie does a really good job with the two daughters.  They get their share of story parts as well which I didn't see coming in the beginning.<br /><br />No this isn't the type of comedy with a ton of depth, nor is it very challenging in both the writing or jokes, but its main strength is definitely in the characters.  They are *all* fantastic, and the tone and flow of the writing is spot-on exciting for my tastes.  I highly recommend it.  Perhaps the only complaint is that constantly cussing, acting immature, and poor decision making probably isn't the typical behavior of 40-year olds.  Well perhaps in today's world it might be.  I'm not there yet so I wouldn't know!  I have 8 wonderful years to go!
B008Y212PI|5.0|Got this as a free app.  I thing this would be good to keep the brain working and plan on teaching to an elderly friend.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|best game ever.... so fun and so many adventure u can go on its so addicting and super fun to play
B0089XH38M|3.0|After a few days I get an update so I go through the procedure and after I press install it says,\\" that update has already been installed\\". I called my provider they recommended I unstall it so I did.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Device: Kindle Fire- First Generation.<br />Purchase Info: Free App Of The Day- Saved $1.99.<br />Related Great Apps: All the FlipPix and GabySoft puzzles, CrossMe, CrossMe Color.<br /><br />I always try to find time to work on a logic puzzle. I like the mind stimulation and the relaxing mood that the FlipPix Puzzles provide. A variety of nanogram pictures are provided in various scenes. The same picture will be seen on the 5×5, 10×10 and 15×15 grid options. But I don't mind because the pictures are absolutely beautiful!<br />FlipPix provides a tutorial for those who may need to review how to complete the puzzles. Just be careful not to select the Hammer when you intended to select the Paintbrush. The Hammer that removes cells is positioned right under the Paintbrush. Removing cells is just as important as coloring the cells. However, there were times that I accidently hit the Hammer just as I was about to complete the puzzle and received three errors. I like the challenge of having the error option turned on but hate having any errors on the puzzle. I always restart the puzzle. To make it easier to redo the puzzle I take a picture of the almost competed puzzle with my phone and recopy and complete the puzzle. Saves a lot of time.<br />I have purchased several FlipPix Puzzles and will continue to purchase more in the future.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|After hearing my friends talking about Downton Abbey, I had to see for myself so I downloaded all three seasons.  I was not disappointed!  This is a fast moving show compared to other series. I was totally taken in by the servants trials and tribulations as well as the family of the house.  I loved being transported to another time.  It is amazing to see how times have changed from the very formal way of living to the way we live today.  I can't wait for Season 4 to start.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I received this mouse about 3 weeks ago and so far it has been everything I expected and more! I play tons of games and it gets the job done, without a doubt. The response time is lightning fast, the buttons are positioned perfectly, and it feels great in the hand. Whatever they're doing over at Anker... Keep it up because you're doing something right!
B003G4W49C|3.0|This book is gripping and very well written. It's thought provoking and unique. I'm just not the target audience. The details of the story are part of its beauty but I'd like the condensed version please. The author definitely does what he sets out to do in challenging your thought processes and creating a while new universe complete with different norms and laws. I won't be waiting in line to see this in movie form in the theaters. I know several people I'll recommend this book to. It's just not my type of book. I'm glad i read it though.
B00846REIS|4.0|I ENJOYED THE BOOK BUT IT WAS ALMOST LIKE RE-READING 50 SHADES OF GRAY, ALMOST LIKE THEY USED THAT BOOK AS A GUIDLINE, ALTHOUGH I DON'T KNOW WHICH ONE CAME OUT FIRST.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was just recently introduced to this movie by a friend. I had never heard of it, then to find out it was based on a true story! This movie will have you routing on the puppy, laughing at it's antics and lack there of.  Then the movie has you sobbing because the love between man and dog can never be underestimated! The movie seems to slow down for awhile, but it does not disappoint! I recommend this movie to anyone who has had a deep relationship with a dog or anyone who doubts the loyalty of a true friend! This movie is one that you will never forget. Don't miss your chance to see this movie!
B00846REIS|5.0|Incredible plot and love story. Can't wait for the last one to come out! Very similar to 50 shades, but I liked it better
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I really like this. I cannot say that I use it a ton yet, but do plan to more in the future. Only played with it a few times. Setup was a tad hairy at first...was having problems hooking up to my router, but I did get it and super easy to use once it is hooked up. Very convenient when you are trying to show a room full of people something  and not have them all huddled by your laptop! Entire room can see it all at the same time..whether it be a movie off Netflix or a website looking up a product...etc. I thought the price was a deal (I got 3 months of Netflix thrown in on the deal too). It's pretty handy thing to have.
B00F35BV64|4.0|Very good movie! Effect were amazing, actors all performed great! Maybe not as good as the first, but still a darn good movie!

B00COGY2P2|2.0|We were very disappointed in the quality of the DVD and the video freezed up and we were unable to view the last 3/4 of the video. It must have been currupted. we would like to either review the video or have our 5.99 returned to my amazon account.<br />thank you
B00886XQO0|5.0|Just what I was looking for. Works great. Very comfortable. Would recommend to others. Have been told to be careful with them because they break easy, haven't seen that yet in any Turtle Beach product I have owned.<br /><br />Update... They will shut off randomly but I would turn them back on and they would work fine for the rest of the night.

B000ZP6MIY|5.0|This was a gift, so comments are those from the recipient.  She had worn out a previous pair, bought a clog of a different brand that was agony in it's inflexibility.  She not only put these on, but kept them on for awhile, she was so glad to have something that did not hurt her feet, had good cushioning underfoot.
0783227434|5.0|this movie is such a b-movie classic. anyone who says they like b-movies HAS to watch this, as well as the two movies that came before it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book and not the ending I expected, now onto the next. Fifty shades darker I'm sure u won't disappoint.
B001I45UFC|5.0|I couldn't put it down! An excellent read (: also, a classic! Everybody should read this series. CS Lewis really brings it alive!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I love James Rollins and the sigma Force novels. This one was interesting because it was set in a place that I haven't read too much about.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|i love this movie!! even the gut wrenching moments. the bond that those 2 little boys shared was even stronger than death. so sad, but absolutely touching.
B004YXE438|4.0|Besides being very colorful, these puzzles offer enough options that make each puzzle able to be played many times and never be the same. You can decide how many pieces you want and just how difficult you'd like your puzzle to be. Easy puzzles when you don't want to think to hard and the same picture can get very challenging when you want a brain work out. Either way, these puzzles are fun.
B005LJK3AC|5.0|The situations are so dire, and the characters' approach to solving their problem is ridiculous. Plenty of surprises in the plot. Loved it!
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Bought these for our garage door opener remotes. Two of these are almost $5 at the local big box, but only $2 here for 5. Worked perfectly and a great price. Only weird thing is a five-pack instead of a four or six pack.
B00005R24K|5.0|this movie is thrilling as well as funny. you just can't replace the classics. i know they made a new one, but i was less than impressed with the new one. this wins over all.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I was given a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review, and I can honestly say reading \\"Peter, Enchantment and Stardust - The Poems\\" is a more like a wonderful gift, because I loved them all!A wonderful collection of enchanting poems featuring amazing fairy tale characters that we found in the first book. If you purchase the book, these poems will come to life and jump out at you. You'll recognize the characters. I was really able to connect the two immediately. This book is beautifully written and so captivating.
0385486804|4.0|the book was good it took a while to arrive but I got it on time and it is in very good condition, you have to think deeply in order to fully appreciate this book.
0312430000|5.0|I spent 20 years examining financial and operational failures throughout the world.  Because of political \\"gotcha\\" fears and liability concerns, most failures remain unknown . . . as do the lessons learned.  This is why I found The Checklist Manifesto so refreshing.  This is a thought-provoking book that will help you do your job better.  Modern technology and information overload has placed incredible demands on every profession.  Medical professionals, captains of industry, finance, law, audit, governments and vessels are struggling with the impossible demand for human perfection in a more and more transparent world.  While professions are stuck on more and more training as the response to human failure, Gawande offers practical procedural solutions for dealing with the human side of failure in today's complex world.  I doubt you will ever be the same after reading this.<br />Richard Quis co-author [[ASIN:0984907602 Thinking Anew: Harnessing the Power of Belief]]

B00CKR63F2|5.0|I was given a copy from the author in exchange for an honest review, and I can honestly say reading \\"Beyond Bridalveil Fall (Dwellers Of Ahwahnee)\\" is a more like a wonderful gift, because I loved them all!A wonderful collection.<br /><br />This is an inspirational book about life, love, happiness and forgiveness. It gives you insightful information that will make you reevaluate your own life by telling you how the author did.Each section ends with a question or challenge giving the reader an opportunity to take a few minutes for private reflection or meditation to consolidate his or her thinking on the topic of the chapter.<br />I was really able to connect the two immediately. This book is beautifully written and so captivating.
B00DJ80VLS|3.0|First off, even when DT is bad they're still pretty good, but this album is a surprising decline in quality. I felt like Black Clouds was the first album where they started to get a bit stale and maybe that's why Portnoy wanted to take a break. ADTOE was actually very impressive except something was missing for me in the drum department which I think was partially the production that put the drums more in the background than usual. With this album, the drums are punchy again and sound great, but I have even more issues elsewhere in the production. The vocals sound almost like there's autotune on them in certain parts and really lack life. LaBrie obviously doesn't carry quite the range he used to but that isn't the issue because he sounded great on the last album. Here it is the production. Something just isn't right. The production in general lacks life outside of the fact that the drums sound much better this time around. There are some good songs here although it took me a few listens for them to sink in, but I'd say Behind the Veil and The Bigger Picture are the best of the lot followed by The Enemy Inside and Along For The Ride. Illumination Theory sounds way cooler than it turns out to be, but it's still good if a little disjointed. The messages Petrucci writes about are as good as ever, no problems there. Portnoy was just way way better at producing than John Petrucci. What's ironic though is that Dramatic Turn of Events sounded great except for the drums not being up front enough and now we get the drums up front but everything else sounds compressed and robotic to an extent. Like I said, it lacks life almost like it's too produced. I don't know, but something is up with the production and outside of that, the songs are fairly uninspired. Along for the Ride is great until Rudess pulls out some crap sounding keyboard effect on his lead. It's kind of like the sound he uses at the beginning of Solitary Shell or in Octavarium except that it sounds like crap herelike it was a $100 keyboard.<br /><br />I don't want to knock these guys because they are awesome and even when an album falls short for me it still has a lot of great stuff on it, but this is for me the worst since Falling Into Infinity and they had an excuse on that album because the record label pushed them into a more commercialized direction. This is as stale as DT has ever been. I want Portnoy back dammit! No offense to Mangini, he's great, but Portnoy did a lot more than just drums.

B00AZMFK3K|4.0|In \\"Star Trek Into Darkness,\\" JJ Abrams manages to do the seemingly impossible.  He manages to please hard-core Trekkies by drawing into their memories of the old series, while at the same time allowing a new generation of post-ironic individuals with no attention span to enjoy themselves.  This movie is fast and furious in outer space, and it stars one of the most complex villains in the sci-fi world.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I may have to get a second one.  The 6 and 10 year old have trouble sharing it.  They love it.  I do too.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put this book down! Not just because of the heated parts either...... I won't give too much away but it is a FANTASTIC book! Within two minutes after finishing it, i had already bought the second book and was downloading it! No one will see me till I read this one either. Lol
B00E88YNJY|5.0|I purchased this CD on a whim and I have not been disappointed.  Her sound is unique and yet it taps into the roots of Americana...Black, white, indigenous and all those folks in between.  She makes me think of my Grandmothers, my mother, church and the jook joint.  I love that she has decided to create music that speaks to the soul as opposed to something boring and mainstream.  I look forward to hearing more from this young woman and hopefully she will inspire others.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Quite often when I hear people rave about a show I immediately check Amazon to see if they have the dvd/instant video and what the reviews say. I then take a chance and check it out. Being a Prime Member (a terrific deal) I have five seasons to watch The Good Wife  FREE on my Kindle Fire.I have been watching this show non-stop until my battery gets too low; then recharge and start watching again. The Good Wife begins with a cheating husband (Chris Noth of Sex and the City fame)  vowing for a big political career but his wife (Julianna Margulies, of ER fame) kicks him out and goes back to work as a lawyer.  Every episode brings trials and litigation and investigations and political goings on and there isn't one episode that has put me to sleep. If you liked Perry Mason, Aly McBeal, Boston Legal, Cold Case and the like you will love this show--I am on the fourth year, episode 12 and I've been watching for days and days and days. I will have a meltdown until I can get Season Six-if there is a Season Six. Go for it--you won't be sorry and remember if you're a Prime Member you can stream all the seasons and episodes absolutely free on whatever Kindle or other android you have...now that's a big<br />W O W!!!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this GOSH darn game! It's challenging and extremely addictive. It makes you think and leave no stone unturned. The best thing is that it was FREE. I would be happy to pay for it if I had to.  Keep games like this coming.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|TANGLED by Emma Chase<br />STOLE MY FREAKIN' HEART!!!! YES!!<br />I have been waiting all summer to find that book - that book that completely knocks your socks off.  And here it is. Tangled is the debut novel from Emma Chase. I absolutely LOVED this book - it is without a doubt the funniest romance book on record.  Here's the thing - this book has ruined all other books for me for awhile because nothing will compare.  I loved the VOICE of this book. It is sarcasm at its best, while still delivering a very hot, very tender love story. This is the story of Kate and Drew. Drew is an arrogant, sexy, alpha-male AND VERY SINGLE investment banker. He picks up a new woman every time he's out - he \\"never rides the same ride twice.\\" Kate is the new hire at his company - and \\"Daddy\\" assigns the two to work on a project together. She is confident, beautiful, and very engaged. The plot is phenomenal; the characters are so rich I just want to be friends with them!! This book is my BEST summer find, and I'm adding it to my TOP TEN LIST!!!!<br />I'm in love with these fictional characters, Kate and Drew!!!<br />Let's face it; BOYS are just BETTER in BOOKS!!
0439023513|4.0|I am on the fence about how the third book was set up and written. I very much enjoyed reading the third, but not nearly as much compared to the first two which I had to force myself not to finish in one sitting. The first is obviously marvelous, inspiring, gripping, nearly perfect leaves you begging for more. The second was my favorite, great depth to the story and characters is developed. This book, the third and last of the trilogy, was kind of dry, slightly boring and so slow in the beginning. The characters start to not feel real, Gale's anger, Katniss detaching herself form everything around her, Prim has only a couple of scenes revealing her great personality, we need more Haymitch in general there wasn't enough, but Peeta's development is great, heart breaking and confusing, but then at the end there is no effort to wrap him up right back where he started. The revolution is probably my favorite aspect of the books but it feels lazily dragged out in this book, doesn't quite make sense and isn't completely realistic. I still loved this book because I am so attached to the characters and the whole revolutionary story of Panem. I was sobbing through the last 60 pages, the most I have ever cried at a book. I am happy with the ending and how much sadness is in this book, the despair the book made me feel was fantastic, I can't believe a book can do this, but the ending was rushed and the whole book set up was strange. The beginning goes on so long and you follow Katniss being boring, on the edge of insanity and pathetic (which is a good realistic aspect of her character, she should be slightly insane and pathetic considering everything she's been through before reaching legal age), which while necessary could have been shorten greatly, the action and conclusion in the revolution is a lot better, I really enjoyed reading about them through the capitol, and then all the sudden it feels like a year or two is squeezed into the last twenty pages...WHAT! I would have appreciated greatly even if 100 more pages were added for the development of the execution, trial, the new Panem, where all the characters end up and why and obviously Katniss and Peeta's new life. All this really emotionally important (to the reader) information was crammed into such little time the reader doesn't get to create any stance on what's happening then the book is over. I think we all wanted those 20 pages to go on! Real disappointment at the end to have such a rushed emotional process, the reader is left to assume pain, confusion, denial, recovery, etc., of the characters in the end after so much has happened. Again, on the fence about the quality of this particular book but not about the quality of the actual story, I still loved it The story is a such a great story, it deserved a better layout and delivery! But I give it the score based on how much I enjoyed reading it and how great I think the story is, and I take away a star for the disappointment in delivery.
B00DK9FNLY|1.0|I got this game because it had a discount for that day and it was free. I thought to myself \\"It was a paid game, so it must be nice.\\" When I got it, it was pretty hard to score. And the movements were unrealistic. Such as the ball moving in the air. And as everyone else said, it was more ads than entertainment. I really didn't have fun with this and I am considering returning it.<br />Translation: It was blackmail.
B004LROMWU|4.0|Great cast good plot. I believe it will be very interesting. I only got to see the first season so I am looking forward to season 2.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is super addictive! I just can&acute;t get enough! If this rating was based on thumbs it would get 2 enthusiastic thumbs up!<br />Any who... the areas the minions run through are challenging and aesthetically pleasing. The villains are easy, but fun easy not boring easy.  I don't mind paying for things like costumes and Gru coins, but I wish they were not as expensive ad they are. In short TRY THIS GAME!!! It is amazing!
B0093OGBL6|5.0|Michael Jackson was such a compelling figure for so many people from all over the world that it is not a wonder that we are continually drawn to his enigmatic personality.  He was spiritual for sure, and Karen Moriarty's insightful view of Jackson adds to our understanding in some unique ways.  The book is delicately written with high style and skill and worthy of your time, even if you are not a devotee; it is almost as if she channels Michael as she takes us on the journey to know the King of Pop and a legacy that will not die!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Kik works excellent for Apple and android products, but not Amazon ? I get an error message every time. I have perfect Internet connection and correct log in info. Hundreds of people have complained about this issue and still no effort to fix it or at least say &quot;we're working on it&quot; I mean seriously ? Might as well not have a rating for this app if they aren't going to take in consideration of the con reviews.

B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I loved this season of Hannibal, and could not wait for this to come out on DVD. It's the best series I've seen in a long time, the acting is phenomenal, and I love not knowing what is going to happen next! Try this series out - if you love a well-written drama-horror-thriller, Hannibal is for you!
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|This series makes you think.  It was not &#34;dumbed&#34; down to the viewer.  It actually challenges the audience to think and develop theories.  I loved the actors....  I loved the plot (not so much the topic, but the way the drama unfolded)....  I loved the development of the characters....  I loved that each character became more than what they seemed at first--a good reminder for not judging a book by it's cover!  Great understated commentary of how complicated life can be and how one persons actions can affect so many.  Another programming plus, IMHO is that the series wasn't dragged out and compromised for advertising or for ratings purposes.  In short, it was a deliciously stimulating visual book:  short, sweet, and to the point.  (Hollywood could learn some from the BBC in this concept.)  My husband and I will be watching it a second time just to look for things we missed in our first viewing!  5 stars+, thumbs up!!
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|The Shining was never one of my favorite Stephen King books. Of course, I recognize it as the classic haunted house novel that it is, second only to Shirley Jackson's Haunting of Hill House, in my humble opinion, but it's never been my fav. That honor would probably go to Salem's Lot or maybe Pet Sematary. Still, when I learned that King was writing a psuedo-sequel to the book, I got excited. It's always exciting when King publishes a straight up horror novel. As stereotyped as he is as America's King of Horror, he really doesn't write as many horror novels as you might think. Joyland was a mystery novel. 11/22/63 was a sic-fi thriller, as was Under the Dome. The Dark Tower series is fantasy, and many of his more well-known books, the Green Mile for example, are more fantasy than horror as well. So, yes, a return to the horror genre by one of its masters tends to get me excited, especially since he described it on his website as \\"a return to balls-to-the-wall, keep-the-lights-on horror.\\"<br /><br />So is Doctor Sleep \\"balls-to-the-wall, keep-the-lights-on horror\\"?<br /><br />In one word, nope.<br /><br />Now, I'm not saying it's a bad book. It isn't. It's a very entertaining read, and there were passages that tugged on my heartstrings a bit, or made me ponder some of the themes King was trying to evoke with the book-- mostly about family and that great mystery we share but cannot share (as King so insightfully puts it).<br /><br />But it just ain't that scary.<br /><br />I think one of the problems keeping this book from being \\"balls-to-the-wall\\" horror was the villains. The True Knot are a bunch of polyester pants wearing, Gypsy-like old folks who cruise the US in RVs looking for children who possess the shining to feed on. Beneath their ridiculous facade, they are actually psychic vampires, and they torture these kids in order to get them to produce \\"steam\\", a sort of psychic cloud that floats up out of their mouths at death, which the True Knot inhales to maintain their youth and vigor. As villains, they are more pathetic than creepy. In displaying them so prominently in the novel, King commits one of the cardinal sins of horror writing: he shows the monsters too much. They are displayed so prominently in the book, their powers and motives explained so meticulously, that he completely pulls their fangs. That, coupled with their silly names, and quite a bit of scatological humor, turns them into cardboard caricature villains. I couldn't even feel very sorry for them in the end, when (I think) King tried to save face by pulling the sympathy card. They're not evil. They're just doing what predators do. Umm, lame.<br /><br />The main character of the novel is Danny Torrance, now Dan, a scruffy but handsome forty-something-year old who is battling alcoholism, the nightmarish memories of his childhood experiences in the Overlook Hotel,  and some major guilt. He gets a job at a hospice and joins AA, and eventually comes to befriend a young girl named Abra, who is also gifted with the shining. When the spunky teenager runs afoul of the True Knot, Dan steps in to protect the girl from the ravenous old geezers who want to suck up all her youth. Throw in some stereotypical New Englander sidekicks, an extraneous quest to fetch a baseball glove, and you have a slightly formulaic but satisfying race to the finish line. I won't tell you where the book reaches its climax, but you can probably guess pretty early on where King is going with all of it.<br /><br />Doctor Sleep is a fast-paced supernatural thriller (fast-paced for King, who tends to ramble), flawed in only two ways. One, he spends too much time and effort trying to justify the True Knot's actions and make them seem more desperate. I think he felt they needed more motivation to pursue Abra so relentlessly. They didn't. And two, he spent too little time fleshing out the Doctor Sleep aspect of the book. I found Dan Torrance's hospice work far more riveting than the True Knot's measles or Grampa Flick pooping his pants. The parts of the book where Dan helps his terminally ill patients \\"pass on\\" to the other side had me glued to my Kindle. So basically, the main flaw is the book's pacing, but it certainly didn't ruin the experience, just left me wanting a bit more of Doctor Sleep and a bit less of the True Knot.<br /><br />Kudos to King for coming back to the genre that made him a literary superstar, but he's going to have to dig a little deeper if he really wants to nail our balls to the wall.<br /><br />-- ROD REDUX, AUTHOR OF THE OLDEST LIVING VAMPIRE SAGAsles or Grampa Flick pooping his pants.

B00DJ80VLS|1.0|Five stars for the album, one star for the CD mastering.<br /><br />Other reviews have said this, but it needs to be repeated, lest anyone should be caught unaware: the music is great, solid DT quality, but the mastering for this CD is TERRIBLE.  The compression kills the dynamic range and makes the album nearly impossible to listen to through headphones or decent speakers.  This is a true tragedy of the loudness war going on in mixing/mastering these days.  After being disappointed with the CD sound quality, I read some reviews online and was convinced to re-purchase the album in higher-res FLAC from another website.  Irrespective of whether you think higher resolution FLAC is a hoax, the source for those FLAC files is a different master than the source for the CD (compare the wave forms using Audacity).  The mastering used for the FLAC version is MUCH better than the CD.  The dynamic range is good and the overall difference in clarity is very noticeable, even when comparing MP3 ripped from the CD versus MP3 ripped from the FLAC.<br /><br />As for the album itself, I think it's a good addition to the discography.  I like it a lot more than A Dramatic Turn of Events, but it isn't necessarily anything new from the band, just consistent DT goodness.  It's nice to get a better feel for Mangini's drum style in this album, too.  All in all, I'm happy with the album, but unhappy I had to buy it twice because the CD master quality was so terrible.  I'm probably done buying physical discs now.

B00710Z87M|5.0|This Is an excellent book, easy to read and understand.  When read in conjunction with You are a Badass! Also available on Amazon.
B00DWFQ2N4|3.0|I'll be honest and admit that I was really hesitant to pick up this second volume of The 20/20 Experience, because I found the first one to be a total snoozefest. I almost hate to put it so crudely because I don't want to diminish the fact that Justin Timberlake truly is a talented guy and a real artist in every sense of the word, but being comprised mostly of overly long, drab, meandering, melody-less tracks, it seemed more like a personal pet project or spur of the moment studio jam session rather than anything meant for mass consumption. Obviously I'm all for artists who think outside the box and don't cave in to mainstream conventions, but the finished product was almost TOO abstract, in my opinion, and the disconnect between artist and audience was just too obtrusive to get over. After hearing this new disc's first single, Take Back the Night, I thought perhaps he might be headed in a more upbeat, poppy direction this time around and was curious enough to buy the whole album. After several listens I can definitively place Part 2 ahead of Part 1 in nearly every way, there's no question about that, though it's not perfect, and certainly isn't without its fair share of weaker moments.<br /><br />The disc opens with Gimme What I Don't Know (I Want), which is a fairly straightforward dance track which nicely blends futuristic techno effects with old school R&B beats. I get kind of a sweaty, steamy, jungle vibe from this one, and another reviewer nailed it when they said the opening bars sound like a Queen song. The party continues with True Blood, which is sort of a sexy Thriller for a new age - I believe it even samples the same Vincent Price maniacal laughter - and is definitely shaping up to be an early favorite. And just in time for Halloween, too! I'm sure the nearly 10-minute running time will cause many to pass this gem over completely, but it really is their loss. Drink You Away is a decent song that shows Timberlake venturing into folksy Johnny Cash-like territory, with admirable results. Cabaret's instrumentation struck me as too clunky to really be enjoyable, and I was never a fan of Drake's voice even on the best of days, so him popping up here certainly doesn't help matters. Amnesia and TKO didn't leave an impression on me one way or the other, and Murder could have been more interesting had it not sold itself out with yet another interchangeable guest rapper interlude. The album closes with Not a Bad Thing, a midtempo ballad that wouldn't be entirely out of place on one of Nsync's latter CDs. (I'll let you decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing, lol.) The subsequent hidden bonus track, which I believe is called Pair of Wings, is a touching, low-key acoustic affair that is absolutely phenomenal and may be worth the price of admission alone. I honestly wasn't impressed with either of the red bullseye retailer's exclusive bonus tracks, Blindness and Electric Lady. They're a bit dull for my taste and never really seem to get off the ground, but a collector should be glad to have them nevertheless.<br /><br />As you can see, Part 2 of The 20/20 Experience is a varied album that strives to offer up a little something for everyone, which already puts it at an advantage over Part 1 where nearly every song sounded virtually identical. True, it's a bit of a hodgepodge and perhaps less cohesive thematically than Part 1, but I found many of the individual tracks to be much more enjoyable in and of themselves. (Another reviewer compared this to Prince's \\"The B-sides,\\" which is about accurate.) In short, what's good is REALLY good, but you'll have to wade through some filler to get to it. In fairness, there's very little that I would actually call bad, so I figure a middle-of-the-road three star rating is appropriate. At times Timberlake seems a little in over his head with these \\"high concept\\" albums, and perhaps is trying too hard to consciously set himself apart from the pack when these types of artistic progressionsneed to just happen naturally, but I respect what he's trying to do here and the fact that he actually evolves. I admit part of me is still fond of his older bubblegum pop days, but I have a feeling he's way beyond that now and we'll just have to wait and see what he offers up next.need to just happen naturally, but I respect what he's trying to do here and the fact that he actually evolves.

0061950726|4.0|The story about the orphan trains was fascinating. It's a part of this country's history that hasn't had much coverage. Since it is a story of the orphan train, it is primarily Vivian's story and less is said about Molly's story. Molly's foster parents seem like clichés but our foster care system isn't pretty and there is a reason for those clichés.<br /><br />Vivian's story touches on many aspects of the 20th century (depression, WWII, country schools) about which more could be written. It is the story of the emotions one woman carried and in some cases tried to bury over nearly a century. It left me wanting to know more about the children who rode the orphan trains.

1250030951|5.0|While Eleanor and Park turned a lens on two misfit hearts, Rowell's follow-up frames a poignant coming of age journey, a story that tilts on the blurred line between adolescence and adulthood. Yes, Rowell's vibrant voice still shines, but there's an edge--a brutal honesty about life and loneliness and identity--that's new and compelling in its own way. Yes, there are elements of romance, but Levi and Nick don't define Cath. Cath's story is different. She's in her first awkward, uncertain year of college, and she's finding her place in the world. In short, she's embarking on a very meta, very timely hero's quest--one that sometimes mirrors, and sometimes belies the fanfic novel she posts online. The two stories are intertwined, but it's Cath's tale that ends on a new beginning. If you've loved Rowell's previous books, dive in. You'll love Fangirl, too.

0374533555|4.0|I did not consider this book for its contentious ideas regarding human thought, but rather as an interesting framework regarding thought processes and a different perspective on the way we process information. I find Daniel Kahneman's \\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\" is a fantastic read as an expansion of his earlier work with Amos Tversky on the human decision-making pathways of heuristics and algorithms which the book are presented as the two \\"main characters\\" as he likes to call them: System 1 (the fast) and System 2 (the slow). Overall, I enjoyed Kahneman's engaging use of examples and simple \\"mini-experiments\\" which allowed me to try and witness the results firsthand.  The addition of light humor in his simple, yet robust writing style keeps the didactic tone at the forefront of the text while still keeping the admittedly long book interesting enough to keep the pages turning.<br />Many of the points that the author brings up throughout the book are usually preceded or supported by some sort of \\"do-it-yourself\\" type exercises.  One of my favorite examples is the \\"add-1\\" and \\"add-3\\" exercises where you make strings of 4 digit numbers.  You read a number, wait 2 seconds, then say a new number with each of the digits incremented by either 1 or 3.  For example, the number 1234 in the add-1 exercise would become 2345 and in the add-3 scenario, it would become 4567.  These exercises are used to indicate just how what the extent of working memory is in most people and the physiological strain that effortful processing can have on both the body and the mind.<br />One of the most interesting devices I found in the book was the dichotomy Kahneman creates from the moment I turned to the first page.  He tells the reader to treat the book as two major characters.  The first character is the unsung \\"hero\\" of the story of our mind: System 1.  It is always on and gets its hand first on anything and everything our mind comes into contact with.  The main principles or System 1 is that it is quick, more \\"emotional\\", and more susceptible to biases and errors.  It operates efficiently, with little effort, and is constantly operating in the background. In other words, System 1 operates in what Kahneman and Tversky call \\"heuristics.\\" On the other hand, Kahneman brings in a supporting character that believes it is the main character: System 2.  System 2 is more deliberate and conscious, and is what we identify with when we refer to ourselves.  However, it requires much more conscious effort and thus is only used when System 1 cannot come to some sort of solution, answer, or analysis with the information at hand.  Thus, System 2 operates via algorithms and is less prone to emotional and cognitive errors, though not entirely immune.<br />This underlying dichotomy thematically arises in our everyday lives and in a multitude of different cognitive tasks.  Kahneman touches on topics including psychology, neuroscience, and his Nobel Prize winning specialty: economics.  Personally, as a debater, I have a special interest in economic theory as arguments involving economic considerations are a common occurrence in rounds.  This is probably why Kahneman's discussion of these systems contextualized in an economic scenario particularly caught my eye.  In the aforementioned circumstance, he brings up the psychological notion of prospect theory, which earned him his Nobel Prize in the field of (behavioral) economics. To begin with the, prospect theory accounts for the error in the expected utility hypothesis which states that people make decisions, such as gambling, based on the expected payout. However, using Kahneman's terminology, this would be more of System 2 centric approach. In experimentation, he reveals that decision making involving risk factors is more heuristical in nature and is therefore governed predominantly by System 1 wiring.  Prospect Theory suggests that decision making is based off the potential total loss or the potential total gain instead of the expected outcome (based of the equation x = Σxnpn). This also indicates that people tend to be more \\"risk-aversive\\" by nature.  In other words, humans tend to fear loss more than they hope for gain. Additionally, a loss of a certain magnitude will yield in more negative emotions than a gain of equal amount would elicit positive emotions.<br />While the economic and behavioral applications of decision making is interesting to me, other readers might find some of the other ideas in the wide variety of topics that Kahneman delves into more engaging or meaningful.  There are five overarching parts that he outlines in his book.  In the first part of the book, Kahneman focuses on setting up the dichotomy of the two systems and the experimental basis for their existence.  In part two, he indicates the impact of system 1 in heuristical analysis.  Specifically, he discusses the cognitive biases that come from the quick pathway of thinking.  This section is particularly important in making the point that there lies some counterbalance between the speed of processing and the accuracy that lies therein.  Part three discusses the implications that people are overconfident in their decision-making.  Though decisions based off of gut instincts may \\"feel\\" right, they may be proven to be considered mathematically irrational. There is also the underlying notion that compared to careful statistical analysis, we are more often wrong in our perceptions than we are truly accurate. The penultimate part refers to the role of decision-making criterion in the choices that people make.  Risk analysis is the largest factor in understanding how and why people consistently choose certain courses of actions over others.  The main takeaway is the belief that people are inherently risk aversive.  This is beneficial both evolutionarily, but also in the sense that is logistically makes sense in most scenarios to err towards a false negative (Type II statistical error) than it is to a false positive (Type 1 statistical error). Finally, Kahneman comes full circle to holistically comparing the two systems and how they interact with each other in order to assist us in solving the problems that come to us day to day.<br />In the end, I feel that this book has given me great insight into not only how we think, but also why we think that way.  I feel more aware of cognitive biases as well as potential errors in my judgment and reasoning that I know I not only have made in the past, but will probably involuntarily continue to do so in the future. Overall, I believe there is much to take away from this book both on a conceptual and a lifestyle level. It is important to realize that one of the biggest ways to develop as a person is to understand our respective selves and this book, to a large extent, has helped me further that understanding.

B00DOPEGAS|5.0|Ok yes Rainbow Loom was first BUT this is just as good!! My daughter bought this for herself from the Toys R Us & I was nervous at first & wished we bought the original Rainbow Loom because of all the negative reviews I read. I gotta say I am 100% happy with this product! People mentioned that the rubber bands keep popping off, well I seriously believe that is just because they are not holding the band's down properly with their finger while they loop. If your child is young they might have a problem with this at first BUT if you point it out & actually sit down & do it with them the first few times this issue will resolve quickly. I absolutely love this set & I have to say I am hooked myself. Another complaint was the instructions, sure anything like this will seem complicated upon first glance but pop on YouTube & watch some videos & your set. I made every style bracelet in 1 night & it got easier & easier. This is something that the more you do it the better it gets & from what I understand as you advance you can even add beads. Soooo long story short, no I don't think Rainbow Loom is \\"better\\" I think they are exactly the same & your little girl or boy will be perfectly happy with it if you help them at first.

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|After 10 years of hearing nothing but great things about this show, I finally took the plunge.  The plunge being a one weekend marathon leaving me feeling somehow accomplished and sad that it could not continue.  I would advise that you space out your viewing a bit more than I did, but view it you must!  Like many shows canceled before their time, Firefly has garnered a cult following to rival any and the reasons are clear.<br /><br />The plot follows the spaceship, Firefly, captained by Malcom Reynolds and packed with a crew of disparate characters who form a sort of dysfunctional family.  You've got everything from a lofty doctor to a shepherd (what would now be called a preacher or something similar) to some muscle that can hardly put a sentence together.  The crew cobles together a living by doing odd jobs for various factions from planets throughout the galaxy.  As is stated in the introduction, Earth could no longer handle her population so man went out and created new Earths by terraforming other planets.  The Alliance was formed in an attempt to govern the central planets leaving the outer ones to more closely resemble the Wild West than a futuristic utopia.  The concepts are unique and somehow real, the characters are wonderfully flawed and the writing is fantastic.  A gem among vapid, adrenalin dependent sci-fi blockbusters.

1476727651|5.0|Although Stephen King has slipped somewhat over the years from his nail biting scare-the-pants-off-you storytelling of the 70s and 80s, \\"Dr. Sleep\\" brings him back to those glory days of fiction writing. This novel is less a sequel to \\"The Shining\\" than it is a story of family, redemption, and one man's search for the purpose and meaning of his life. The body of the story takes place when Danny Torrance is 41 and the the girl he mentors is 13--life is a circle, and he assumes the same role in Abra Stone's life as Dick Hallorann did in his. Without belaboring plot points, I will say that this story focuses less on scaring the pants off the reader and more on exploring what it really means to be human, and how people connect and intertwine on many levels. Probably more than any other King novel I've read, \\"Dr. Sleep\\" demonstrates the author's fundamental humanity---it (pun intended) shines through on virtually every page. I don't read too many novels that I practically have to be forced to put down, but this story is one of those rare birds. You don't have to have read \\"The Shining\\" to enjoy \\"Dr. Sleep\\", but the numerous references to Dan's year at The Overlook Hotel help remind readers (like me) who read it when first published and have forgotten many of the specifics of the traumatic events of that year. If you're on the shelf about this book, get it. You won't be sorry.
B0013F0L96|5.0|His story telling along with some killer rock and folkish music keeps me going back to this album after all these years.
0553296981|4.0|A great book. A bit strange to read, knowing the outcome, while Anne doesn't. At times, the book reads like a fictional diary where the author knows where she's going with the story, knows the ending, and is putting in poignant little moments or comments to pull at the reader's heart strings, but of course Anne didn't know the ending when she was writing her diary, and that makes it even more poignant. Reading the last few months of the diary was the hardest because she kept mentioning things she was going to do in October of that year or what she wanted to do after she finished school, after the end of the war, and all I could think was \\"No, your not going to get to do those things\\" because the Nazis are coming in a few weeks and you'll die in a concentration camp a few months after that. It was amazing how, with the thought of concentration camps and other horrors on her mind she could still write some really trivial stuff about boys that she was soooo in love with, and the arguments that her fellow companions were having about food and use of the toilet among other things.
B00EY8A6BC|3.0|Somewhat predictable but i was also a little confusing. Its worth watching though just for Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman
B00F91RYL8|4.0|It moves fast and had to watch a few times to see the whole movie, but since I rented it from Amazon that was cool! I give very few movies a 5..

B00D6BN9NK|4.0|This movie is an action packed thriller. Bruce Willis excels in this role. It is along the lines of a Bond thriller.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|Don't waste your time.I gave up after about one half hour. Wife made it 15 minutes. Title should have been Zzzzzz
B0030N3O8Y|4.0|This show is a very action packed type.  It moves quickly and keeps you engaged but some of the sub plots seem to hold it down until they reveal the entire purpose of the sub plot.  Overall I liked the show because it does have a hint of plausible reality but it for the most part is more of an action show that keeps your interest most of the time.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Although not as scary as the original (thank you), I was so glad to finally know what happens to the surviving characters.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I really love Downton Abbey!  Although the story does hold my interest the costumes leave a lot to be desired as they caused a distraction, so I subtracted a star for that alone.  Mismatched clothing, cheap looking dresses and jewelry on crooked or lopsided  necklaces indicate cheap imitations.  I think they could pay a few dollars more to get appropriate materials or rent them!<br /><br />I really do enjoy the entire collection, don't get me wrong.  I watch on my laptop and it's like reading a historical romance novel.  I tried watching on tv and it somehow lost it's appeal and I haven't figured out the reason.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|A great story about modern life and the ancient double standard. Hope, love, weakness, temptation, strength.... this show has it all!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Simple. Funny. Great graphics which I've come to expect Gameloft. Funny side notes and missions. Same as subway surfer just...minions lol
B008Y212PI|5.0|Nice game to play to pass the time. Quite a few puzzles.  Takes a certain amount of logic to figure out.  Not too hard.
B004EPZ03E|3.0|Like many sequels this one was a bit of a let down. It was in need of a lot more comedy, but was still fairly entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Epic game for any age awesome fun with lots of fun just using your fingertips and enjoying the minion eye candy.
B00866JL96|5.0|What could be better than a movie where you get to see Zac Efron work up a sweat and show a lot of skin? A movie where he makes you fall in love with the man underneath all the muscles. In a story of heart wrenching loss, love and laughter you will find out what it means to be The Lucky One. Lucky me, I already know!

B008OOYALE|5.0|cool app Im happy its free if I spell words wrong I'm only 9 its a awesome game get it I love breeding the dragons.itsso aweasome get it
B00F91RYL8|1.0|Call me ignorant but I had no idea that the &#34;Z&#34; stood for Zombie.  I'm not a zombie fan but my wife and I decided to give it a try.  First, there were so many scenes, filmed in near darkness that you really couldn't recognize the good guys from the zombies - they must have been trying to save money on makeup.  Those scenes were so dark that they were very hard to follow - very frustrating.  It had a weak story line and was so fragmented that we chose to exit, before the climax (I assume that the zombies lost) and watch the evening news, which proved to be much more interesting.
B005USZML4|5.0|This book is far below my reading range and I still enjoy it, I recommend this book for anyone who likes crime.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I came upon her music late but I'm glad I did. Her voice is very soothing and seductive which makes this album great for listening to over and over.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only reason i gave this 4 stars is i turned the sound off but it came on by itself a couple of times other wise i love it its a great game especially if you love brain teasers
B00AHXIC50|5.0|The album is great and I like how they incorporated a 70s rock feel to the music which I can say is a nice touch for this young musician.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't even. The amount of tears that are falling from my eyes can make a river and honestly half of them is because this life changing book is over. I seriously think this book changed my view on life. I can't even. Thanks for such a good read and I hope everyone in the universe reads this deep book. I couldn't put it down. Goodness gracious. I can't even.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Although it may take them many years to produce something they never disappoint and this album is a testament to that fact. :)
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I enjoy period dramas very much.  This one is much like Downton Abby, it is true, but with its own tweeks and twists.  Very enjoyable.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This story honestly talked about the realities of the American prison systems. Her story was not a poor me, it was not  a it's not my fault story. She was honest with the reader and herself about her situation. As much as one would hate to admit she finds her self in that year. She also lets the rest of us realize she was very lucky. Many prisoners do not have the support she had and has. This one book I will read over and over again.
B00F4KGJRO|5.0|Alan Jackson delivers.  If you're tired of the current top forty country, come to Americana Music.  There is still great music out there--it's just not on mainstream country.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Now I know why everyone raves about this series. Great characters, great insight into British aristocracy post World War I, great set design and just good all around entertainment.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Since the release of the original version of \\"Vapor Trails,\\" I've thought that the album had some of the band's strongest material, but the quality of the actual recording was so bad and so muddied as to make the album all but unlistenable. The new, remixed version changes all that! After the remix, vocals - including harmony vocals I never knew were there - are crystal clear. The drums have punch. The bassline is distinct. Most importantly, Alex Lifeson's guitars are no longer an overwhelming mash of indistinct, buzzsaw noises, but rather are well balanced and integrated with the rest of the band. It's so nice to hear distinct rhythm and lead parts. The addition of new (or previously buried) guitar solos to many of the songs bring new life to the music. Especially with a good set of headphones, the new release is a revelation!<br /><br />I was never tempted to crank up the volume with the original disc, but the new version sounds so good that it's hard not to crank it up. If you purchased the original version of \\"Vapor Trails,\\" but you were disappointed by the sound quality, this remix is absolutely worth the price. In fact, even if you were fine with the sound quality of the original, there is so much more to hear, whether newly added or simply clarified, that many Rush fans will want to purchase the remix to hear a fresh take on a pivotal Rush album.<br /><br />Five stars, all the way.
B001QK91TY|5.0|Unbelievable music from the golden age of jazz! What an interesting slice of 1950s life - the jazz fans enjoying the festival, America's Cup, the close ups of such amazing jazz greats  and the best music ever. It's only a song or two from each of the greats which certainly can leave you wanting more of each but it does give you a good feel for the festival.
B005STRPRY|2.0|I understand that the whole concept of the movie is not exactly family material so I was excited when I saw this termed &#34;family friendly&#34; because my little girls LOVE this movie (unfortunately a family friend showed them the real version thinking the adult themes would go over their heads). Meryl Streep calls herself a &#34;slut&#34; in the family friendly version! need I write more? Now I have my 6 and 9 yr olds asking me what a slut is.
B003VPWXRO|4.0|A fascinating glimpse into how anorexia can grip a talented, beautiful person in a nearly psychotic state, while those around her cannot easily intervene, but eventually must step in to save her life..A very engrossing read.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I literally couldn't put this book down!  One of the best I have read in awhile.  At times I cried.  Definitely a must read.
B00ENV1HPY|4.0|I did not know who Mazzy Star was by name, but quickly realized they made some great music in the early 1990s then fell off the map until now.  Bands like Beach House have picked up the ball and run with their rainy daydream rock music, making a name for themselves.  Listening to this album, I can see how they arrived at this influence.<br /><br />What prompted this band to withhold releases from the 90s until now is unclear, but I am pleasantly surprised by this band. Highly recommended. If it weren't for the high price, I would consider the purple vinyl.
B004GYY714|5.0|Try it - you'll use it every day!  Not only for music, all you would want in a radio... news, (out of town sports) weather, traffic, police scanners, etc, etc. - endless. and it's FREE!
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I am hooked on the series. This is a very good sequel but not as good as Ender's Game. Almost done and ready for next.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Loved the impartial historical retelling. A must read. Good triumphs evil. One of the best WWII books I have ever read.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Kids really likes it, both 4 year old and 7 year old, which is somewhat of a coup these days.  Visually stunning and sweet story.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|It felt like it was missing content such as action and a build up to the fix to the glaobal problem at hand. All of a sudden there was the fix and it was all over. The movie to me felt like it ended early in that sense. You are contemplating how or what are they going to do to fix this global epidemic and suddenly the movie is over.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The information is concise, lots of information but very succinct. Anyone that's contemplating publishing a Kindle e-book has all the pertinent information to succeed in their adventure.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Fun game. The addition of &quot;repair points&quot; and upgrades adds a fun dimension. The overall level of difficulty feels about right for a casual game. Kids enjoy it too, though are sometimes frustrated by the speed of the missiles by about Day 10. Some kind of sandbox mode might be a fun a thing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|I am a practicing Catholic with 12 years of rather rigorous Catholic education including 1 year of dedicated Bible (New & Old testament) Study and 1 year of 'Catholic Church History' instruction.  I found the premise of ZEALOT, seperating the historical life of Jesus of Nazareth, the man from the theological narrative of the life of Jesus, The Christ - 'King of the Jews' and ' Creator of the Kingdom of God' to be very clarafying.  Understading the historical facts of the realities of The Roman Empire during Jesus' time on earth helps explain the obtuseness or indirect nature of some of His teachings and parables.  In plain English, had Jesus directly stated his status as TheSavior and King of the Jews he would have been accused of treason and suffered death long before his betrayal and crucifixion in Jerusalem.  The historical disclosure of the lives of some of the Disciples and Apostles, the facts about the writing of The New Testament and the maturation of Christianity in a Greco-Roman society is extremely enlightening.  Believers of a literal interpretation of the Bible will be disturbed by the 'findings' of this book.  Others willing to take a more objective, less 'faith-based' view of Jesus' teachings may find an enlightening context to re-study His message!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great show!  I am hooked-I watched all 3 seasons over the summer, and can't wait for season four in 2014!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Great book.  It kept me guessing from beginning to end.  The characters were very real, very human, and very easy to relate to.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|One can never be completely sure about one's own existence.<br />Who am I, what am I, why am I?  Compelling decisions create unpredicted futures.<br />Hosseini takes his readers along<br />a journey of several generations with twists and turns through rugged countries ravaged by epic wars<br />and somehow connects it all with one common thread.  Hauntingly sad yet touchingly told.
B002KGEORM|5.0|Season one hooked me and season two kept me on the hook for more. One of the best shows one air.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Soo I had to get an extra thumb from a nameless henchman who died in Skyfall, But it was worth it! Casino Royale was sick! Quantum of Solace made me sick but The Sky isn't the limit on how awesome skyfall is. Great action, loved the vintage roots and story and the villain did his job well, creeped you out and you couldn't wait for Bond to lay the smack down on him. Great Job!<br />Cheers

B003NTSBTC|5.0|I normally don't watch &#34;scary&#34; movies, but love Leo, hence my renting.  SOOO glad I did.  Only warning I have, if you rent it, you must MUST watch it twice.  You get sooo much more out of it the 2nd time.  Just like Titanic.  You will not be disappointed in this movie...  even if you think you may be the 1st round, watch it the 2nd time and you'll love it.
B00991TCOG|5.0|My son bought it for me.  The music is great.  Most of it (perhaps all) is played on a cello.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app.  For a free battery app this is the best.  It.does not take up a lot of room on your device and does what a battery app should. Additionally there are no adds, it's free, and you can change the battery color.  All that about Kindle Fire is BS because I have had this since June 2013 &amp; my kindle has had no problems.
B00EB6ENXO|5.0|This is such a great movie and the digital download was super easy! Definitely planning to use amazon again for my digital movie needs.
0307744434|5.0|I'm not an avid reader of fantasy or other genre work, which is why The Night Circus likely blew me away.  The author created a vivid world, so specific and yet dream-like, she was able to take something as stereotypical as a \\"circus\\" and turn it on its head in a way that seems both real and unlike anything you've ever seen.  While books I love typically have me racing through, to discover the ending, with The Night Circus, I read slowly.  Part of this is because its richness is in its details, and the other part is that I didn't want my visit to this fantastical world to end.<br /><br />Sadly, given that this is the author's debut, it will likely be a while until I'm again able to delve into one of her tales, but hers is a voice I hope to read again and again.
B00646Z09K|4.0|If there was a more granular scale for rating on Amazon I would really give Primeval more like a 7 out of 10 rating. Over the five seasons this series ran there was a trend that happened more often then I liked -- character changes! Just when you get to liking one of the characters -- poof, their gone -- doh! Fortunately what kept me interested as that the replacement characters managed to work -- just have to give them a chance to win you over.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Addresses a major issue that most people face.  Explains a lot of what goes on in life and why some succeed and some are always miserable.
B000W746GK|4.0|I have enjoyed all movies and this was no exception. Really enjoy they stay true to the book series as much as possible.
B001ENS0BI|5.0|Amazing! Every show, every season! Action packed, heart stopping, excitement. This show is addicting, I am unable to stop watching it. You love the good guys and hate the bad guys and scream at the TV. Love it!
B00E7NIMZ6|5.0|2013 has been a good year for Hans Zimmer fans like myself. The renowned German composer has scored the music for four major films this year, three of them already released, with one more still to come. His score for Man of Steel was met with a storm of both positive and negative press, dividing listeners between those that hailed it as a bold and modern reimagining of Superman's musical identity and those who lampooned it as yet another minimalistic, over-synthesized formulaic soundtrack in the vein of The Dark Knight's famous two-note motif (I have found myself occupying somewhat of a middle ground). Next came The Lone Ranger, which elicited a far more positive response, overcoming the same tonal inconsistencies the film suffered from with some individual moments of musical ingenuity, a few tributes to Ennio Morricone, and a fantastic adaptation of the William Tell Overture.  And now we have Zimmer's rock soundtrack for Rush, the Ron Howard F1 racing film, and I am happy to report that not only is it Zimmer's strongest album of the year, but it may provide some of the best music the we have heard from the composer so far this decade.<br /><br />One of the critiques often leveled against Zimmer is the fact that his thoroughly modern style of scoring (electronically driven, structured similar to rock music, simple progressions relying more on powerful and sonically deep performances rather than technical nuance) is applied too often to contexts it is not suited for. This is most certainly not the case with Rush. It is hard to imagine that another composer in Hollywood today would be more suited to score a 70's racing drama, as the source material plays right into Zimmer's strengths. A product of late 70's/early 80's rock himself, in which he started his musical career, Zimmer's compositional style has always been rooted in guitar based chords and structure. Classic guitar riffs, pounding percussion, and a dash of synth-powered orchestra is exactly what this film needed, and Zimmer delivers.<br /><br />The album opens with the muted whoosh of racecars in \\"1976\\", which broods for a minute or so with eerie atmospherics and synthesized strings interspersed with delicate piano. Eventually a guitar joins the mix, building a sense of anticipation with a simple repeating pattern (what will become a racing theme of sorts) before a majestic cello piece surfaces, heralding the main theme's arrival on brass along with a sudden and energetic blast of guitar and percussion. These elements make up the backbone of the rest of the score. The racing theme supplies a pleasantly simple and uplifting sense of excitement and eagerness, getting its best performance on \\"Stopwatch\\", one of the finer pieces of music to come out of Remote Control Productions in recent memory and easily the highlight of the album. The sense of hope and passion on that track flows almost seamlessly into the heavily percussive and guitar driven \\"Into the Red\\", capturing perfectly both the adrenaline-pumping intensity of such a competition as well as the natural swagger and arrogance of the racers themselves.<br /><br />\\"Into the Red\\" is but one of several action cues that prove to be standout tracks, racing forward with a propulsive energy driven by both guitar riffs and excellent percussion. The drums in Rush prove far more effective than the much hyped 12 piece drum orchestra Zimmer assembled for Man of Steel, for here they do not simply hammer the listener into submission, but rather utilize interesting rock techniques in \\"Watkins Glen\\" or accompany a powerful discordant guitar wail prominent in \\"1976\\", the transition between \\"Stopwatch\\" and \\"Into the Red\\", as well as the beginning of \\"Car Trouble\\". Guitars chug menacingly under synthesizers during \\"Nürburgring\\", before sharp, rapid percussion joins in. \\"Car Trouble\\" proves to be the most engaging piece of Zimmer action music since \\"160 BPM\\" from his 2009 Angels & Demons score, racing forward with perfectly blended drums and guitar, and becoming particularly poignant thanks to the guitar riff from 0:57-1:23 and reprised on strings later in the cue. Never does Zimmer fall prey to the minimalist droning and pounding he has become known for recently. His action music for Rush is instead nuanced, weaving the racing theme in and out of these and other tracks, as well as incorporating the main brass theme on \\"Reign\\" and prominently throughout the majestic \\"Lost but Won\\".<br /><br />This brass theme is a fairly simple and standard construct for the composer, but it effectively communicates the self-perceived importance and significance of victory for these F1 rivals, and it is weaved beautifully and subtly throughout the score, twisted and contorted throughout the disturbing \\"Inferno\\", and reprised triumphantly on \\"My Best Enemy\\". It does not hurt that Martin Tillman's cello performances of the theme on \\"1976\\" and \\"Lost but Won\\" are chilling in their gravity and nobility. Zimmer is not afraid to let rip with the period rock vibe either, and \\"I Could Show You If You'd Like\\", \\"Oysters in the Pits\\" and \\"20%\\" will all be standouts for those who enjoy that era, along with the several rock songs from the time that are seamlessly included on the record. It is a credit to Zimmer and his production team that their original music is mixed and composed so authentically to the period that it is easy to lose track of which songs belong to Zimmer and which belong to the likes of Thin Lizzy, David Bowie and others.<br /><br />In short, Rush showcases Zimmer at his best, adapting his style sonically for an era it is perfectly suited for. Rush is a must-have for fans of the composer, showcasing a truly hopeful and uplifting guitar motif, some of Zimmer's best action music in recent memory, and a noble brass theme all presented in a classic and accurate period context. Rush will thrill and excite every bit as much as the F1 race cars it is intended to represent.<br />***<br />See more reviews like this on my blog, \\"Pulling On The Push Door\\".

B008M4MB8K|4.0|Blade Runner, Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi masterpiece, is both a critique of our human need to create and an exploration of what it means to be a human. The film starts with an explanation to the viewer that, early in the twenty-first century, the \\"Tyrell Corporation\\" has advanced robot evolution into the next phase, having achieved the ability to produce \\"replicants\\"--artificial beings virtually identical to humans. Replicants are superior to humans in strength and agility, and are at least equal to the genetic engineers who created them in intelligence. At the time of the film's beginning, replicants have mainly been used off-world as slave labor and in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny by a team of \\"Nexus 6\\" replicants on an off-world colony, however, replicants have been declared illegal on Earth and have been barred from traveling between planets. \\"Blade runners,\\" on the other hand, are human detectives whose priority is to hunt down and kill--or \\"retire\\"--any replicants who have illegally made their way to Earth. The replicants' original designers were afraid that their creations, after a certain period, would develop emotional responses of their own--such as love, hate, and anger--and so they gave all replicants a four year lifespan. It is my belief that this film, in its use of a futuristic setting and its portrayal of the relationship between humans, blade runners, and replicants, showcases our deeply human need to create, reveals how our acts of creation can have unintended consequences, and explores what exactly make us human.<br /> There is a scene early in the film where a replicant, Leon, is interrogated by a blade runner who uses the \\"Void Kampf Test,\\" which searches for emotional responses in a test subject by measuring the movement of the subject's eye while the subject is asked targeted questions. The blade runner asks Leon to \\"tell me only the good memories you have of your mother.\\" Leon does not answer and instead shoots the blade runner, ending the interview. Leon's reaction shows he knew he could not respond to the question in the emotional way expected of a human because he has, in fact, no memories of his mother. His instinct was to kill the interviewer and end the questioning. This suggests that memory is what makes us human. If one can detect emotional responses to memories, then one could tell who is human and who is artificial.<br /> Another scene that illustrates this point comes about a third into the movie, when the main protagonist in the film, the blade runner Deckard, is asked go to the Tyrell Corporation and apply the \\"Void Kampf Test\\" to a potential replicant held there. Dr. Tyrell, however, asks for the test to be performed on his assistant, Rachel, to show that it can positively identify a human. However, the interview with Rachel goes on much longer than usual and Deckard comes to the conclusion that Rachel is a replicant who believes herself to be human. He then asks Dr. Tyrell how it can be possible for Rachel not to know who she really is, to which Dr. Tyrell responds that Rachel is, in fact, an experimental replicant implanted with the memories of Tyrell's niece. Dr. Tyrell's experimentation reflects our basic human need to create and continue to improve upon our creations. By giving this replicant memories, he has created a more advanced being that is harder to detect as artificial. This again suggests that one of the most human characteristics is the possession of memories. Rachel, when she finally realizes that she is a replicant, becomes intensely emotional and does not know how to cope with the revelation that, although she has human memories, she is not human.<br /> Replicants were created for use as slave labor in off-world colonies, freeing actual humans from hard and hazardous jobs. However, as Deckard puts it, \\"replicants are just like any other machine, they are either a benefit to society or a hazard. If they're a benefit, then it's not my problem.\\" If the machines we create to benefit society turn into hazards and cause humans to become hurt or dead, are they worth the effort and time it takes to create? It seems clear that our creations, even if we make them with good intentions, can have unintended, and even disastrous, consequences, especially if we give our creations the ability for thought and reasoning. If we are to allow our creations to think, then we must put in place certain safeguards to diminish the possibility of their uprising against us. One scene in the film in particular deals with this insight. Roy, the leader of a group of replicants on Earth, is on a mission to discover his incept date in order to prolong his life. He discovers his creator is Dr. Tyrell and believes the doctor has the power to prolong his life. When he meets with Dr. Tyrell near the end of the film, Roy realizes that the doctor does not have the power to prolong his life and so kills Dr. Tyrell in a very horrific manner. While creating Roy, Dr. Tyrell almost certainly did not think his most advanced creation to date was going to be what ended his life. There was no possible way of knowing this would happen. In an earlier scene, we see Leon and Roy, on their quest to elongate their lives, appear at the workplace of a genetic eye designer named Chen. They use harmful interrogation tactics on him and discover that their creator was Dr. Tyrell and that they should find a genetic designer named J.F. Sebastian to learn more about their incept dates and longevity. They then kill Chen with no sympathy or compassion, which shows that they have no respect for human life.<br />  Another interesting scene comes about half way through the movie, when Roy and another replicant, Pris, discover the location of Sebastian and proceed to his building in order to try to access Dr. Tyrell through Sebastian. Sebastian, a leading genetic designer at the Tyrell Corporation and sufferer from an advanced aging disease, recognizes immediately that they are \\"Nexus 6\\" replicants, admiring them for being perfect, and bonding with them because they, like him, have short lifespans. He then asks them to show him something that they could do. Roy replies, \\"We're not computers, we're physical.\\" Pris then replies, \\"I think Sebastian, therefore I am,\\" before performing some gymnastic moves and reaching her hand into a pot of boiling water. Pris' response shows how these replicants have an understanding of what it means to be alive and suggests that they may see themselves as more human, at least in some ways, than many actual humans. Sebastian lives alone in an enormous building and has contact only with the toys and friends he has created. This reflects, once more, our constantly felt human need to create, be it for industry, to solve problems, for companionship, or simply for the act of creation itself.<br /> The final scene in the film has Deckard face off against Roy in dramatic fashion upon the roof of a building in the middle of a rainstorm. As Deckard hangs off the edge of the building, in danger of falling to his death, Roy states, \\"it's quite an experience to live in fear--that's what it means to be a slave.\\" Roy then pulls Deckard back onto the roof and says to him, \\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe, but all those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain.\\" He then takes his last breath and dies in front of Deckard. This scene shows that Roy knew his end was near and understood that, even for humans, no memory will survive one's death. Even our most advanced creations will inevitably come to an end.<br /> In closing, I feel that Ridley Scott's Blade Runner shows how we, as humans, have a constant need to create, even though our acts of creation may very well have unintended consequences. The film explores human experience and asks what it means to be human. I believe the scenes I have discussed here are great examples of this exploration and this questioning. I feel Blade Runner should be seen by anyone interested in our future and the direction we might be going as a society  . Though I know it is very difficult to predict what our own future may hold, I know for certain that we will continue to create new and exciting things, because such creation comes naturally to us as humans. I also believe, having taken Blade Runner to heart, that one of the main things that makes humans so human are the memories we accumulate through life, as well as the particular way we use those memories to experience the world around us.
B00AC8ZIXO|5.0|I don't know who liked it more, my husband or grandson.  I looked at it while they were watching it.  It really is pretty good.  To them it was awesome.
B00E8S2JZ4|3.0|Lord of the Rings:  3 books, 3 movies = great.<br /><br />Hobbit:  1 book, 3 movies  = cash-grab.<br /><br />The first Hobbit movie was too long and painfully slow in parts.  And now they're releasing an extended edition?  How much can you stretch 1/3 of a book?<br /><br />I can't believe this was made by the same people that made the LotR trilogy.  Length aside, it just wasn't FUN like the LotR films.  Much like the new Star Wars trilogy (with anakin & jar-jar) wasn't as fun as the first and real Star Wars trilogy.  But at least the new Star Wars films weren't boring like half of the first Hobbit film.
1419705849|4.0|It took longer then I expected (2 weeks), but not longer then it said. The book was actually \\"brand new\\", but obviously a reject. The binding was crooked and the back was warped. But, it served it's purpose, the school library took it as a replacement for the one my son lost!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It was great to discover how easily I could link to my cloud data - thanks for the great app!
B0035JNTA6|5.0|This is a classic stupid humor movie with excellent acting for what it is. If you are in need of a pick me up on a bad day you cannot go wrong with Zoolander. This movie is not for everyone, maybe the 28-40 crowd.
B002ZG974M|3.0|The name pretty much says it all here, as we follow four newborns from vastly different cultures through the first year of their lives. Without a spot of narration or even so much as a subtitle track for the non-English segments, it's a classic case of a film allowing its viewers to take whatever they want from it. As a relatively new parent myself, I was fascinated by the day-to-days of the two rural babies - one from the dust of west Africa, the other the grassy fields of Mongolia - and how completely alien their surroundings and practices seem from my comfortable perch here in the first world. It's tastefully filmed, with a particular emphasis on artistic framing and long, captivating shots of unsupervised children at play, encountering and discovering their world one step at a time. My young boys absolutely loved it, but at this point they'll watch almost anything with a cute face or two. Nice eye candy with a hint of deeper meaning, but not a show-stopper.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved this book.  Written in a very strong voice of the father who is a prosecuting attorney.  Fast paced and definitely a discussion book that would be great for book clubs.  Looks at hard facts from many sides.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The case is very lightweight. It still has a hard shell which will protect against falling damage. My only complaint is that it has to be on a hard service to correctly stand upright. I still recommend that you purchase it!
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|I've seen this film over 10 times and it still has the same impact as it had back when it was first released in 1973.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Terrible- acting was awful and the scenery was really laughable.  Perhaps it was supposed to be like<br />that, we were not sure.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Gaiman does it again! Wonderful story. Readers will be disappointed it doesnt go on and on. Magic exists in literature and Gaiman makes it happen.
B00942Y4IY|4.0|This is the first high definition download movie that I've tried after getting my kindle fire HI definition .<br />The movie is one of the better sci-fi movies out and since it's a prime download I like it even more.<br />I would give it a higher rating if I could find a way to hold the 7 1/2 inch kindle fire without slipping through my fingers.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I really enjoyed the first season as well as the second, I just think the alian invasion was a little over the top and lost my attention. I like that the actors from the first season played new characters. I'm super excited about the new season The Coven to come out.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I liked it, but was not the best book I have ever read. For ages 14 and up.  It has plenty of plot twists and is entertaining. A good read if you need something to read in-between other series.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is honesty the best game I have ever played. It is so funn and it keeps my mind running. I cant wait for the new updates to come out
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|What fun to be able to follow the lives of the elite English throughout History!<br />Great actors and good story line. Not just another soap, but a way to follow<br />a family legacy and the people and relationships who mattered to them!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book is REALLY good. I strongly recommended it. Please get this book it is funny, interesting, and REALLY good.
B00F91H15W|4.0|I think I can say I enjoyed the movie where others might not for two reasons. 1) I love Sofia Coppola's directing style and 2) I was interested in the Hollywood Hills burglary case from a sociological standpoint. If either of these also fits in your camp, I would recommend giving it a try. I was glad I didn't pay $13 to see it, but for a rental it was definitely enjoyable. I think the great soundtrack and steadfast delight that is Emma Watson on screen is what pushed it from 3 to 4 stars.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Michael Douglas was terrific. The gestures. The whiny voice. Wonderful. Those of us who remember Liberace from the 60s and 70s might be able to better assess how well Douglas recreated him than someone who is too young to have lived through those relatively innocent times. To appreciate this film it helps to have an open mind. It helps to have some level of maturity.<br /><br />In those days many of us thought Liberace was simply an eccentric and very talented artist. We didn't dream what might be going on behind that candelabra. The movie showed me a very sad and lonely little man whose overbearing mother pushed, prodded, controlled and steered him into this career. He never played a piano for enjoyment in his homes and was incapable of having a lasting relationship, even with someone he loved.<br /><br />The sets recreated Liberace's sometimes tasteless, often tasteful, and always excessive decorating style. I felt as if I were in his Las Vegas home.<br /><br />Even though I liked it very much and enjoyed it tremendously, I will criticize it just a little. The movie could have been shorter. The ending could have been less silly.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|We get to see more of Stark and less of Iron Man, which makes for a great movie!  I felt like a kid while watching, it was a great ride.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|It amazing very enjoyable , and very fun to play when bored. Feels very realistic when playing as well . I love it

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This story carried me thru a beautiful life journey and brought me back home. Most entertaining.<br />Good cast, good plot, good developing, good ending.
B002VECM6S|5.0|Had already read the book & seen this movie 3 or 4 times & LOVE it. Knew I had to have my own copy. Sandra Bullock is just awesome & of course, it's just a great uplifting story. Thanks.
B00EDPFJA4|5.0|Great Album, huge fan of Drake. Got it super fast so overall good experience and I was absolutely not disappointed.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I grew up on Perry Mason and love courtroom drama.  The Good Wife doesn't disappoint with courtroom drama and is enhanced with inter-office politics and interpersonal feuding.  Wonderful show.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  I now have a new view of prison life for women.  I am looking forward to watching the new series based on the book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have have this book in paperback and now as an ebook.  I love it.  you should read it if you haven't yet. Also, it looks like the movie coming out is a little different from the book guessing from the previews. can't wait to see it!
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|Another great season - though much shorter than the previous seasons.  Great characters and great actors and actresses.  Not quite as good as the previous seasons, but still a lot of fun to watch again after all these years.  Beautiful in HD - if Amazon's streaming service is working correctly.
B002RVCD0U|2.0|More than the horrid shaky camera and fast edits, I was annoyed at the total lack of originality here.  They literally duplicate the final shots of \\"Road Warrior\\", \\"Apocalypse Now\\" and the 1984 \\"Terminator\\" itself (not to mention dozens of \\"Transformer\\" shots.)  The resistance should not have subs, jets, and choppers.  They should have been grimy scavengers with pipe bombs.  Skynet turned out to be a very bland place.  WAY too much CGI.
B00F52YOPA|3.0|This is really a fun game if you like hidden object games. Also like that it has a relaxed mode. I would easily give this game a 5 star rating but for two things: I have been unable to play any of the mini games because they freeze up on my Kindle HD. Then when I reached level 87 the next level will not load so may not be able to go any farther. I am disappointed because it's a really fun game.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Best game I've seen lately. I hate it when you require that I use a certain number of words, so there!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Absolutely love this book! The Shining has always been one of my favorites and was thrilled to hear about the sequel. Dr. Sleep did not disappoint!!!
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My grandbaby loves this.  As a newborn this little money helps hold his paci in place whether he is in his bed or in the carseat...so cute!!
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|It was definitely a page turner.I couldn't put it down. The only bad part was that I guessed the ending about 1/3 of the way into the book.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Funny and much more in this corny alien movie...Simon Pegg is awesome in this movie and I also like the supporting cast. Thank you
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Very good and simple app to download, install and use. Very useful at night and wonderful if developer has more appos ?
B00499NHLC|4.0|A good re-imagining of the Sherlock Holmes stories set in contemporary London. The young Sherlock takes advantage of current technology (computers and cell phones), but still uses his incredible powers of observation and deduction to solve crimes. Dr. Watson is a veteran of the Afghanistan War and is as grounded and reliable as ever.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This has simply got to be the best, most beautiful, easiest to use version of this game I have EVER seen.  Had I seen it before being the FAotD, I surely would bought it!  A most excellent app, Gabysoft.
B000HKYBXA|4.0|The acting in this is superb. Both Heston and the main lead do great justice to the tale, in all truth, it had drawn tears from me.  I honesty think it is the best Hamlet I have ever seen.  My one weakness I see is this: Tell me, in the 17th century, since when did Denmark have such a large black population?!  This for me, dulls the stage of it, as it would if you were portraying a african Zulu with white guys...jeez, enough with the political correctness!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|A fun and easy read with experiments that will surprise and amaze you! I haven't completed the whole thing but i look foraward to each and every experiment.

B008EEZ64Y|3.0|I really enjoyed the story but I think it should have ended 30 pages later. Or at least have a sequel, I feel like it leaves you hanging.
B0000CABBW|5.0|The special edition has some good background information on the Mary calture.<br />This story is based on a Mary tradition tale.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|this game is fun and each level lasts a while.  very colorful marbles.  when I finish a gam I want to start another.

B009XTF8KQ|5.0|This is a great movie, good story line. Product was brand new and in perfect condition, I am pleased with the purchase
B00ARF93AQ|1.0|Not my type of movie or entertainment. Too violent and loud sound affects. I like action movies,but I feel this was over the board type movie.

B0047SKR54|5.0|Great movie. Although it was a sad time in American History, I thought the movie was well done and interesting to watch.
B00006AUIG|3.0|I bought this movie without having seen it on a recommendation by a friend. The movie is ok, that's all I can say. The seller was great, received on time and well packaged, in perfect condition. Would definitely use the seller again.
B005VR9328|5.0|Well done roots, it is a very enticing story, great lyrics and an awesome sound that journeys from mellow to excitation.

B005LAII80|5.0|Great film, the saturated colors during the slo-mo use where fantastic. Karl stayed true to Dredd, and never removed helmet for \\"face time\\", and the music in this movie was fantastic, even bought the soundtrack. This movie needs a sequel.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|this is the best show ever made. I love every charter and the whole premise of the show is funny I know people just like this at work. raz still needs a woman but the rest of the show is awesome
B008Y212PI|4.0|Nicely designed app that keeps you engaged with good, challenging Nanogram puzzles.  Pleasant HD Graphics and Excellent Sounds add to the pleasant atmosphere.  Easy to learn by following the well delivered Instructions and Tutorial.  Lots of Fun even for beginners like me.  Glad I read other reviews and decided to try it.  It is definitely a wonderful Flip-Art/Nanogram app the keeps your interest.  The controls work very smoothly and everything functions nicely.<br /><br />Overall, a great Flip-Art app that is more Fun than I thought it would be.  The puzzles are addictive and seeing the Picture pop up after you solve them is a nice, enjoyabke touch.  You can chose Puzzle sizes from 5x5, 10x10 or 15x15 according to your skill and comfort level.  Ability to Breakout unneeded tiles is a good feature that helps also.  The Exceptional Instructions make it easy for all ages to learn.<br />A SAFE app with No Data-Mining, Ads, IAP or other Intrusions and only 1 reasonable Permission.  Highly polished app that is quite Enjoyable with good Replay Value.  Well worth the Price!
B002G1YPH0|4.0|My computer is a HTPC and was choppy on streaming 1080 HD video.  The temp of the CPU was running fairly high with the original fan and cooler so I purchased this one to see if it would help.  Once installed the temp of the CPU dropped about 25 degrees Celsius and the other cooling fans for the case slowed and quieted down.  It also helped the video performance since the CPU was able to run without being in danger of overheating.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I loved the action in this movie and the villan was the one who made this movie great.  A movie worth watching.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I would highly recommend this book. I read the Shining years ago and always wondered where the characters eventually ended up. This story finally brings closure to a lot of my questions.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app has motivated me to do what something that I have been putting off for years. finally an easy to understand, versitile, and fun to use language learner that makes it less of a chore to learn a new language. Danke!!!
B00915G6R6|5.0|My favorite TV show. I don't usually purchase TV shows I've already seen, but this one has such brilliant writing, fabulous actors, and gripping situations, I look forward to seeing it again and again. The DVDs are in mint condition, protected and compact for easy storage.
B004SIP8W0|5.0|Good for a laugh, but as the movie progresses you can see that (in the plot line), all is not well.<br />I love this movie. I love how the main character &#34;re-frames&#34; the events of the holocaust into a game<br />for his son, to keep his son from being alarmed. I'm not saying one can do that with the holocaust, so I don't want any one to misread what I'm saying here.<br /><br /> What ever we go through in life, it may be possible to experience some things differently, just by the &#34;take&#34; or the perspective we have on what is going on around us.<br />If someone says they hate you, they just haven't taken the time to get to know you. It's their loss.<br />If it's possible to ignore such a person, it's better to go about doing something else. I used to get upset<br />by these types of pronouncements from people(mostly the mean little kids on the playground) but<br />I think it can apply to our every day lives. There always some one some where who makes it their business to make every one they can miserable. They're not happy until they goad someone.<br /><br />The tricks and the antics that Roberto portrays in this movie is hilarious, fun loving, and at times very<br />touching. Roberto is sweet, he is kind, his life portrays a life lived well. I'd love to be able to land on my feet the way he did!
B00EQRP5LW|5.0|This album is great from beginning to end  and is great for the lovers out there! I recommend this to everyone who loves r&b.

B001TCNSOI|4.0|Victoria Yarbrough<br />Clint Eastwood's \\"Changeling\\"<br />Review<br /><br />Imagine being forced to comply to something that you know just isn't right. You feel hopeless and cannot do anything because the only people you can turn to are the ones who are betraying you.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's \\"Changeling\\", a movie about the struggles of one women to find her missing son to no avail of the corrupt 1930's Los Angeles Police Department. We follow the life of single mother Christine Collins (Angelina Jolie), whose 9 year old son Walter was found missing in March of 1928. The LAPD have difficulty trying to find the boy and so, they try and force Collins to believe that a child that is not her son is in fact her son. Under pressure of the media, we get to see the battle of Mrs. Collins against the LAPD to uncover the truth about what has really happened to her son and to bring the corruption of the LAPD to light.<br /><br />  From the instant this movie is turned on, we are dropped in old America. We see old timey 1920's car models rolling by and a beautiful woman (Angelina Jolie) turning on a radio that has to be at least 85 years old by now. The environment establishes setting really well and reeks of a history that most have never seen before or, know about for that matter. Quite convincing. Especially, since everything has been 20's-fied, for lack of better words in the year 2008 of bustling Los Angeles California. The way each scene is shot is in a realistic but gloomy filter that puts the viewer at dis-ease. Not because it was in bad taste, but because there was a real sense of peril that is automatically received from the moment we see the first character; And the viewers will be dying to see the conflict unfold.<br /><br />\\"Changeling\\" was not only dedicated to placing viewers in a 1920's world in a visual sense. When it came to what we heard, we heard nothing. However, this works because there are no dramatic and random music tracks playing at big moments. They weren't needed because the sense of drama was already executed through the plot and through the actors. The actors, Angelina Jolie (Christine Collins), Jeffrey Donovan (Capt. J.J Jones), and John Malkovich (Rev. Briegleb) were completely natural and slid into their roles well, quite naturally. Jolie, portrayed a demure ladylike woman of the 20's who didn't want to cause much trouble and just wanted her just-due justice. Donovan played the position of a very powerful police captain who would do anything to save the face of the LAPD and put women in their place. Watching the conflict unfold between the two became quite interesting.<br /><br />\\"Changeling\\" is definitely worth watching and will make you think. It will make you think about the past and how things are quite different today. If you are a woman, it will make you grateful that things are different today, and if you are a man, well, you may feel neutral or indifferent towards this film. All in all, it can be enjoyed for what it is and you will leave with something which, is in it of itself an accomplishment for a film maker. On a scale of one to ten, I give this movie a seven and a half.ey weren't needed because the sense of drama was already executed through the plot and through the actors.

0738735027|5.0|And who knows better than cats?<br />If you are a tarot aficionado, a cat lover, or a reader who enjoys options to standard Rider-Waite decks, this is a great deck for you. I fall into all three CATegories and love this deck. The cards are well printed, have a pleasant feel, and are easy to shuffle. Standard layouts are readily accessible if you are familiar with Rider-Waite symbolism and smart enough to ignore keywords - these cats allow plenty of room for personal insights. The images are realistically feline; the hisses are almost audible in the 5 of wands, the 3 of wands is obviously wondering when her (fishing) boat will return, and The World is every cat's dream. It makes an outstanding, non-threatening alternative deck if you do readings for people concerned about the \\"evil\\" images in the standard decks - even \\"Death\\" is sneakily pleasant, the Devil is almost cute, and Temperance has a purrfect solution. Deck comes with it's own \\"Little White Book\\".<br />Even my cat approves. (Sorry - the puns overcame me. I love working with this deck!)

B0060ZJ7BC|4.0|Now that baseball's postseason is upon us, there's not a better time to take in a baseball movie.  I missed MONEYBALL when it made its theatrical run, even though I wanted to go see it, but I digress.  Thanks to the wonders of cable TV, I've seen it several times; this account of the 2002 Oakland A's is a keeper.  In particular, it's the story of Oakland's GM, Billy Beane, re-inventing the wheel.  Being the smallest market in all of baseball, Oakland constantly has its most talented players getting snatched up by franchises that can afford to pay them tens of millions.  While most GMs would take the leftovers and try to remain competitive, Beane wants to win.  He wants to win with second and third-tier players.  How?  Statistics.  Winning in baseball is all about getting on base, whether it be hitting or walking.  And winning is about chasing starting pitchers off the mound by the 5th inning, which entails every batter going deep into the pitch count with every at-bat.  So. . .which players on Beane's roster have the best on-base percentage--and the discipline to go deep into the pitch count at the plate?  It's all in the statistics.  And those that boast the numbers get to play, to the consternation of everyone else in the Oakland organization, from the manager to the scouts to the front office. . .to the players themselves.<br /><br />Brad Pitt is solid as Billy Beane.  He's not pretentious or petulant or angry or bitter; he's just a soft-spoken former player with a passion for winning--and a no-nonsense approach to running an organization.  And Jonah Hill is superb as nerdy Peter Brand, a Harvard economist Beane hires to help him crunch the numbers; Hill plays off Pitt's quiet demeanor with \\"aw, shucks\\" gushiness.  Of the supporting cast, I especially liked Philip Seymour Hoffman as Oakland manager Art Howe; Hoffman depicts Howe as the overwhelmed skipper he must have been.  Naturally the team stinks as the season begins, yet Beane perseveres, and over the course of the summer the team comes together and goes on a remarkable run, culminating in winning the American League West.  (Which I readily remember.)  Although it meanders from time to time, MONEYBALL is a feel-good story that, yes, wins.  It's a solid triple, right in the gap.<br />--D.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My daughter of 28yrs of age really tests her and she also has Muscular dystrophy as her daughter, Little Moon. They both are miracles, very,very slow comprehension, but thank God for his amazing Grace and the Patience of Job that everyone should Pray for.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really enjoy Mahjong and have several different games. I like this one because you can try to beat your own time. I've really enjoyed it.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I discovered stephen king in the late 1970s and have loved and aged with him all these years. The story of what happened to little Danny Torrance is masterful and really, wonderfully spooky!  Write on, Mr. King,write on!
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Although this book started off a little slow it was really good.  Once it got going I could not stop until I was finished.  Very good and suspenseful.
B000RH0C8G|4.0|I love his books. simple and to the point. It doesnt take a genius to figure out what he was trying to say but it takes a genius to convey the message. brilliant stuff.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Deliciously awesome. Loved it. Action packed. Great CGI and special effects. Just as good as the first one. Just sit back and enjoy the ride.
B009LDCZDC|5.0|The second season of \\"Homeland\\" introduced some unexpected twists and turns for the characters.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />A number of months have passed. Brody has been elected a senator while Carrie has, after extensive electroshock therapy and medication to help with her bipolar condition, has turned to teaching. Carrie finds herself pulled into an agency op again when an \\"asset\\" she was working with approaches the CIA with information with the opportunity to take out Abu Nazir.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />The second season did something surprising (I can't give it away) by resolving one major plot point well before the conclusion of the second season a very daring move on the part of the writers/producers/directors/actors on the show that pays off with a surprising conclusion for season two as well.<br /><br />For those that don't buy the love affair between Brody and Carrie, I buy it because they are both very damaged individuals who understand each other better than anyone else does them. Although they come from different sides, they share more in common due to their issues than anyone else on the show.<br /><br />The transfer looks very nice--a sharp, rich looking transfer. Colors pop and detail is terrific throughout. This is a state-of-the-art transfer (I imagine the DVD looks quite good as well although I haven't seen it).<br /><br />I have to give credit to Showtime for putting together a good(although not spectacular)package; unlike the Network's former poster boy for quality \\"Dexter\\", \\"Homeland\\" arrives with a number of good extras although, just like \\"Dexter\\", it lacks ANY commentary tracks. In this day and age, that just seems bizarre and cheap especially given the price for the package.<br /><br />We get deleted scenes, a super 8 film diary by actor Damien Lewis, two featurettes and a VERY brief prologue to season three.<br /><br />The conclusion for the second season signals a major shift in the storyline and characters which will, hopefully, continue to pay off with season three (there are indications that it will).opefully, continue to pay off with season three (there are indications that it will).
B008P1EWIM|5.0|Very informative and easy to use. Shows a lot of detail and a lot of people in the world how is the weather.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Amazing cast and story line with a great blend of live action and cgi. Can't wait for the next one
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great show! Every character is interesting unlike some shows which only draw your interest to one character. This manages to freak you out and make you cry while touching your heart, a rare combination!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I was really excited about seeing this because I am a big David Tennant fan.  I was not disappointed at all.  It kept me guessing and pointing fingers right up until the last episode.  I will say no more because I don't want to spoil anything for others.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved it until the end with jace I want them to be together!<br />It just was a weird twist that I hope is not the and will change.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I think I can really relate to this book and it gave me a second look on life  I couldn't put it down I loved it
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|I do really like it, and it is getting addictive.  However,  I don't care what the Developer says about the IA not cheating.  If I bump an AI piece and leave only a single piece of mine in it's place it WILL roll the number to bump mine.  Happens time after time after time.  The developer keeps saying it is truly random, I don't call that random.  I can predict the AI roll based on the current board layout.<br />Nonetheless, I am having a good time playing.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|It was not one of the best action movies I've seen but this one did make a lot of noise. In general, I would recommend to action movie viewer.
B0026YWQ4Q|3.0|This is one of my favorite books in the series.  The movie, not so much.  While much of the movie was very well done, and captured the spirit of the book - I CANNOT understand why the Director chose to spend so much time on the bird flying into the tree each season, and neglect explaining the Marauder's Map!!
B003YTLKTE|1.0|Did not like the movie at all very<br />I don't know how to give no star on less<br />boring I fell asleep after ten minutes too bad I woke up half hour later. Tried to fall back to sleep could not . Would Like to get my money back. Save your money.
B00B7PIRIE|2.0|My second disk does not play the 7th show.  We have tried it twice now and it will not show anything.  We have watched the 4th , 5th and 6th shows twice, but the 7th does not show.  I am very disappointed. in my purchase of this series.  I love the show and wanted to see each show.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|IT WOULD PERFECT IF NO SHOW POPS UP...BUT IS OK BECAUSE I CANT DOWNLOAD ADOBE  FLASH PLAYER IN MY KINDLE TABLET...I WOULD RECOMENDED THIS PRODUCT.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I think the puzzle is awesome. You have to try it out for yourself. Get this program right now and you won't regret it.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Loved it!  apparently there is an awkward 16 year old girl in me somewhere that this show tapped. The angst of it all.
B008MM9630|2.0|I would rate this higher, but there is a lot this game can fix. This game wants to be a faster paced game, yet the important quests and items require gems, which of course you must buy. I am at level 9 and am being given quests that requires me to be at level 20 or higher. That is pointless and annoying. You only get a small amount of energy, you need energy for EVERYTHING. The genie only worked for me once, now it seems if I do not go to it at the exact time I did the first time, I miss out and of course you can play for one gem.<br /><br />The game has potential, the graphics are nice, the play is easy, you can play off line, but there doesn't' seem to be a lot more to offer than that. So I am not sure if I will continue to keep playing this game.
B008Y212PI|5.0|A wonderful way to pass the time. Does wonders for my analytical mind. Not to hard, not to easy. The larger puzzles are really challenging. Got this free from Amazon but it's worth spending money on if your not as fortunate. Thanks
8186939024|1.0|This book was so bad our book club nixed it just a week before our meeting and chose to just read and discuss some short stories instead.  It was difficult to follow,and slow, slow,slow in story development.  In some cases it is worth the wait, but not in this case!<br />Maybe we aren't as open minded as we thought we were; but we couldn't handle this one!
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Enjoyable with Hitchcock twist. Good storyline and acting. Well thought out plot. Very nice cinematography. No complaints just good fun!
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|I like this game a lot. I would have rated it 5 stars but for one thing: the moose game. I like the way you can turn off the plane game, but the moose game has the same problem: the kindle fire only registers two touches maximum. I would like to be able to turn off the moose game as well as the plane one. Thanks for considering my suggestion.
B003CBTVNG|3.0|Okay for a rainy day when you want a few laughs, but I would suggest any other Will Ferrell movie first.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's a great way to relax when you have some down time. Especially when you love horses and just want see them and interact on some level.
B003TOMAPC|4.0|I wouldn't suggest this for kids under the teenage years.  Some pretty gory parts and violence. Nicholas Cage does a great Adam West Batman impression!  I hope they do a follow up sequel.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good graphics, lots of easy to set options that make it work for most solitaire players. Plays right or left handed - bonus!
B002EDH0FE|5.0|This movie is dark, exciting and fun.  Great plot and gives you a more realistic perspective of a human side to super hero's.
1878424319|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me. I must say I am glad they did. I enjoyed reading the agreements. The beginning conversation about the dreams was a bit of a challenge for me because I could not relate. As I continues to read the agreements the dream began to make a sense.<br /><br />Since my reading of this book. I recommended it to several friends who have also recommended it to other friends. Everyone I know has enjoyed reading this book.<br /><br />- Recommended the read.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|This is a very good movie for kids, and watchable for adults. Good bonding movie for family.  Violence is really pretty tame.
B00F35BV64|4.0|I enjoyed this movie. It is an excellent addition to this long running franchise. I hope this ensemble is kept together for more movies in this series.
B000T46NOE|4.0|I would watch this movie as a set up for Hell Boy II.  Gives you the background for the better second movie.  Not that this is a bad movie, but not as witty and the second.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a lovely story that begins in the early twenties ... Is intertwined with current day.  The parallels of two very unlikely women forms the basis of this beautiful story of love, heartache, endurance and friendship.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This is a great book; a fast read that is well-written and thought-provoking.  There were times it made me laugh out loud and other times while reading it I felt extremely sad and even scared for the main character.  Piper Kerman does an excellent job of describing the emotions she felt before entering prison, upon first becoming an inmate, and then the joy and humor once she began making friends and getting into a groove.  There are some hysterical stories about the friends she meets along the way and the writing style allows you to really picture the events/people in your head.  I read this book in just a few days and have recommended it to many of my friends.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is great, I just do not like how they say it is free but once you get to a certain level you have to pay for it.  I may buy it but gonna wait for a little while.  I do love the story line and the graphics are really good.
B008Y212PI|4.0|Awesome game fun to play if you like puzzles. Wish had more puzzles without Facebook.  Still enjoy the game though.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I have been playing this game for well over a hear on facebook and to know now I can have. It on my kindle is the best thing in the whole world. ..., I am really that happy about this!¡!¡
B00594XOZU|5.0|I recently broke my phone and I use this app to receive text. It comes to my kindle like a regular text. Love it
B007N8RULO|4.0|I have had various versions of spider, and I like this one.  It it easy to play, and learn.  Have not yet mastered the 2 or four suits.  I just wish it did not have so many advertisements.
B00F35BV64|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I was waiting on some results and it helped me take my mind off of everything. Better than the first movie, more action, better plot line. If you like Star Trek, then this is your kind of movie.
B008Y212PI|3.0|I wasn't too sure about getting this app, even though it was free.. (let's be honest, it looks like someone went a little too crazy with clip art). But I was surprised how much I like the puzzles.<br /><br />Even so, I'm only giving it three stars because the animations between puzzles are too long and annoying, the sounds are cliche and unoriginal, and the &quot;art&quot; used is a tragic overuse of trite stock images. The app looks like something my nana would design. If the app was revamped for a more modern audience or even if all the art was original and the animations short and smooth, I'd give it five stars.<br /><br />That being said, once I finish all the puzzles, I will be deleting this eyesore of an app. I'm just glad I didn't waste money on it.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|This is a must see for those that love suspense and &#34;I didn't see that coming!&#34; plot twists! Highly recommend!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Love it, very exciting!  Lots of your favorite marvel characters. You have to watch it before iron man3. It ties all the movies together.
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This is one great movie.  Serious, but also funny.  Robin Williams is perfect for the part of Patch.  Highly recommend it to everyone.
B005LAIIMG|5.0|these dvd is awsome i got it in a timely matter it is a really good movie about zombies ''

B00BEZTMFY|5.0|this movie was done very good it is really good and i would reccomend this movie to anyone who has read the book the Habit
1451696191|2.0|I was extremely excited to read this book after hearing all of the hype about it. I did not enjoy this book. I thought the main character was very annoying and I did not like him. I actually enjoyed the movie more than the book which is the first time that has ever happened to me.
B00F5FEZTC|5.0|He never disappoints! I have been listening to Elton since the 70s when he and Bernie Taupen were partners. He keeps coming up with refreshing, in-depth, fabulous scores and as always, great lyrics as well.
0142410705|4.0|After falling in love with the book The Fault in Our Stars, I decided to purchase the rest of John Green's books. This is my least favorite of them. I found the main character a know-it-all and quite annoying. Still, there were a few scenes that made me laugh and it is a good and easy read.
B00E9P959O|4.0|I am not a fan of this record in its previously released version.  It is not a top 10 Rush album for me.  The songs are a little 'tired' and while there's a great bombast in some songs ('One Little Victory' and 'Secret Touch') several other songs drone on in my head and I find myself waiting for them to end. It is what it is and as a Rush fan, I've spent many internet sessions defending my view while still proclaiming my allegiance to the band.<br /><br />Mixing can be described as an artistic interpretation of individual musicians creating a song.<br /><br />Dave Bottrill did a great job at bringing new life to these songs.  I was eager to listen to the whole record.  I wanted to see how he handled this fill or that guitar lead.  I found myself not as annoyed by the entire record while anticipating hearing his approach to mixing the songs.<br /><br />For the most part, he did a better job than the original.  There are some subtle things (vocal delays, backups not fitting as well, some drum sounds) that I noticed but I wasn't turned off by them.  He was able to polish it enough to make it interesting and still allowed the album to be what it was originally intended to be.
B009LA1QW6|5.0|Lana has become one of my favorite artists over the past few years. This album did not disappoint me. If you enjoy her other songs, I would recommend this album.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Overall, a very good book, with lovable characters and an interesting window into the world of those facing death and loss.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so fun i love it my kids love it they are always playing it keep making more. Thanks
B00A11AN6O|5.0|It was a really useful app. I am able to save several pictures with high quality, I recommend it to everyone
B00DW5IKJI|5.0|I don't see what other people's problems with her are, yes these cd's are some of her biggest hits, but it's still good, and I cannot wait for December when her new album comes out (supposedly on Dec. 3, 2013)
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I like the app because it gives a break down of the different features, how long the battery life is for reading, or listening to music, playing games and so on.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love this game, and plan on buying others. I have to tell myself to stop playing it! Now this is a FAOTD worthy game!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I thought the book started out a little slow but then we went from 0 to 60 at warp speed. The plot thickened and the story line took off with changes at every turn and I couldn't put it down until I had finished it. I thought this was one of his best stories.
B004GIZTNA|1.0|....but I didn't. Because there was nothing else to do I sat through 60% of this ridiculous movie. Normally I wouldn't go for a movie like this, but I was bored (and under the circumstances I couldn't really change the channel) I decided to watch The Wedding Planner for the first and last time in my life. Needless to say I didn't like the little bit of what I saw of this movie. First of all, it's one of those stereotypical and rather repetitive \\"busy business lady who's life is missing something but she doesn't realize it because she's so busy with business\\", type of movies (I got that from Family Guy, lol!!). Now that I could've handled, but this movie continued to push what little patience I have with movies like this. At the beginning of The Wedding Planner, I had the sinking feeling that she would end up falling for the groom of one of her clients. But then I told myself, \\"No, they wouldn't stoop that low\\", and lo and behold they did!! So then I told myself, \\"Oh, but his fiancee is nice, J-Lo and M-Hey won't end up together because that wouldn't be right\\". I wanted so much for that to be true, but it wasn't. After I saw the hero's bride to be reaction to J-Lo's \\"fiancee\\", I realized, oh yeah, their gonna end up switching off. I just had to stop watching after that shocking realization. I'm sorry, I just couldn't get through more than 66% of this movie. It's riDONKulous!!

B0045TYDNC|5.0|I switched from Canon to Nikon (don't ask) and (this may sound silly) but the thing I really missed most about my Canon gear was the rear lens cap / camera body cap. They were much better quality than my Nikon ones. This changes that. The LF-1 (which came with all my Nikon lenses) always managed to fall off in my bag, despite snugly securing them. The LF-4 fit much more snug, and I've never had any problems with them slipping off while in my case.
B008Y212PI|3.0|Slow download to my kindle fire hd. I am new to this type of puzzle so I may change my rating later. I think I am doing well understanding he it works and then up comes a red x. Guess I will keep on trying for awhile.
B000667FN8|5.0|I really do not  understand people. This is the band that saved my life. They are not writing songs just to complain. Their music is meant to be taken as help.So yes its true music saves lives <3
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|I enjoyed this compact disc but i did not think it was as good as previous ones. This is war was better.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This app is great for saving space on ones device.  I especially like how it kills unnecessary tasks which run in the background.
B000KI6286|4.0|Interesting movie, good movie - shows how far a person will go to taste success or for money!  Worth watching.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I love drawing on this app. One downside though is you can't increase the canvas size but you can shrink the layers for that effect. I would recommend getting a stylus for this app because using your fingers is a bit frustrating, for me anyway. Their are several more features to explore than what I have mentioned but it is well worth the two dollars. 5/5 stars.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|An intriguing yarn but not enough of the back story - how it all got started and who designed the silos? None the less an interesting page turner.
B007PVHMCG|2.0|If you had told me Lego was going to do a Minecraft kit, I wouldn't be able to imagine how they would screw that up, but they did.<br /><br />All they needed to do was replicate Minecraft blocks, so that kids could make the same buildings as they do in Minecraft.<br /><br />But this - I dont even know what this is supposed to BE.<br /><br />Before buying for my daughter, I must have looked at the pictures on the boxes a dozen times, and none of them really looked like Minecraft at all.<br /><br />Instead of large, study,  cubed blocks, it is this vomitorium of microscopic thin, layered pieces which look absolutely nothing like Minecraft blocks.<br /><br />When I unpackaged it, I nearly got a headache just looking at the big pile of tiny. tiny, identical tiles.<br /><br />I don't know how they could have made this kit any more unappealing. I feel like they reused molds from other micro kits and just tried to get a minecrafty color scheme - they completely phoned this in!<br /><br />Evidently, a 'Micro' kit for Lego means less actual thoughtful toy, for a much higher price riding off a franchise.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|unfortunately for me I saw this one first and have been slowly going back to see who Ironman, Thor and Capt. America are.  Well done movie - with lots of fun.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Great visual fun in this flick directed by Besson-schooled Michael-Bay-clone Louis Leterrier.<br />But definitely an item of the popcorn genre: no-depth, no-brain, at whiles incoherent scenario, unexplained continuity gaps, shallow 0-dimensional character psychology, warbled even confused objectives on the part of the characters, (very) shallow acting (Michael Caine is particularly inept), incredible setup and deception by the revenge-driven actual culprit, inept and needless romance between the two cops ... need I say more? Still, highly enjoyable!
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Not a weak song in the compilation, Sarah's newest material doesn't disappoint. I've been waiting for this, and in many aspects her style grows in ways I hadn't expected. The melodies are layered, the textures are richer... and her voice sounds stronger.<br /><br />I stumbled on Sarah by watching a YouTube video of Mansineedof. It was a solo performance. The song is great, but watching her play it is what caught me. You could see that the audience disappeared while she was transported by her own song. She's into the music for the sheer love of music, and that passion is only bigger with this new release.<br /><br />I've turned several people onto her songs. It was my son who called me yesterday to tell me that he downloaded her new work from Amazon. Didn't know it was released... but it's cool to share such great artistry with others.
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|As many times as I've seen this movie, I just can't get over it... It is truly a masterpiece of acting by Christan Bale... He is truly a gifted actor, the absolute best of his generation. He is generally very particular about what projects he's involved in. Just a wonderful actor.... And the movie, just a masterpiece of filmmaking... The cinematography, acting etc. Spielberg really proved himself with this film and this wasn't well received????? It just proves how common and stupid the american public is...My very favorite scene was the reunion with his parents. He saw his mother and so gently removed her hat to touch her hair, then her mouth. Then she embraced him and the last scene was his eyes, slowly closing.... The relief that was expressed in his eyes was so simple a gesture but so powerful... Unbelievable....
B00B0X4PIO|1.0|A frustrating read with several good passages amongst interminable prose. The time shifts made reading this book hard work. Definitely over rated because of he writers' earlier success. Not recommended.
B00E3JGCHO|5.0|Good to hear The Band a bit clearer and more up front than on Rock OF Ages, however,<br />it seems the instrument who benefitted the most from the re-mix was, guess who's, the guy in charge of the re-mix. Makes sense, right? Is Garth Hudson going to complain? Richard, Rick, and Levon aren't able to. Robbie's guitar playing was stellar those nights, there's no denying he was on top of his game. But the other 4 guys were all cookin' too.<br />This review is based on my listening to the 2 disc version, purchased from Amazon.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|Would give 3.5 stars. Not a fan of the changes made from the book. Wish there was more Emmy rossum
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Sparks is a consistently excellent writer. His books turn the truths of life into a beautiful, generally romantic story, I have read all of his books and have never been disappointed.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I have three categories of movies, good, bad and entertaining.  This falls square in entertaining.  I like the change of story from the original, it wasn't just a remake.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great  plot!!! I really liked the characters and felt as if I knew them as the story played out.Would like more books from this author.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I like these stories but it left me hanging and now I want more..........can't wait to see what happens. Keep them coming
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Love, love, love Michael Buble. Great songs on this CD but I haven't had any of his CD's that I have not enjoyed.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|I was a little hesitant to see a &#34;Zombie Movie&#34; in the theaters, but I took a risk since it was rated PG13. I loved this movie so much that I ended up buying it! It is the type of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but I really appreciated the fact the typical blood and guts were left out. That is just my personal taste. There were three spots in the movie that actually made me scream out loud in the theater because I knew something was coming, I just didn't know what or when! I have not seen the unrated version, nor will I, as I have a feeling it will be way too gory for me. If you want a great movie with out a lot of gore, I would highly recommend this movie!
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Loved it!!  Was just the right sequel with the right persons to make it sooo interesting.  Willl watch it more than once.
B000I9YWZ2|5.0|Singing and acting was spot on, made for a great movie and good insight into the early career of Cash
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great show! Gets better as the seasons go on. Season 1 is pretty good. Season 3 was better. Will be checking out Season 2 in the coming weeks! Can't wait!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this show. Feel like I know the characters personally. Season 3 continues to have interesting topics and twists for the characters. Can't wait for the next season to come out! :)
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I like these type of movies to relax, download my mind and feel good with many happy endings to make it satisfying.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I am a weekend warrior when it comes to cameras. It fits my Canon DSLR with the extra lens, the point and shot and my video camera with the chargers and gear in one bag.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I completely missed the first 3 seasons, but since I'm all caught up, I can hardly wait for season 4!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|good and entertaining, good cast, a funny and interesting super hero combo with good special effects. I would watch this again.
1596912855|2.0|I hate the fact that they use Austen's name on this, she would be appauled.  It is worse than a reality show.  It is play acting at its worst. the characters are shallow and untruthful, they are merely play acting.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This is Vol. 3 in the Clifton Chronicles.  Will there be a Vol. 4?  This book traces the lives of Harry & Emma, Giles, and others through the post WW 2 years into the late 1950's.  As usual, with a Jeffrey Archer novel, there are many questions left haning.  This is a good read, especially if you've read the first two volumes.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Reading the first book was amazing - I was hooked! I couldn't wait to start and finish Requiem. Highly recommend it!
B000PAAH3K|5.0|This book opened my mind to the prejudices in this country. It also helped expand my mind to different things.
B005J0VPNC|1.0|Not worth it at all. The photos regardless of settings and whatnot that you have it one are just useless. You can hardly make out what the images are of!
1442341769|5.0|Great CD for people who are not scientific.  More words, how many more words do you want.  Its worth listening to.
B00FF56IR4|5.0|I love all things Joss and this is no exception... well maybe one exception budget, The special effects, sets and props are all top notch.  Has all the great ass kickery, and the humor his shows and movies are known for.  It rocks!  If your not a Whedonite then give it a few episode, I guarantee that the plot and characters will develop in surprising ways, never be dull, and never fall back on a bunch of go nowhere drama. Its really exciting!  GO Go Go!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Could not put this book down until I had written my review.  Engaging, mysterious and insightful.<br />Very descriptive of the human spirit.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is a fun app mainly because it is not a brain bruiser. Simple logic solves the puzzles. Good purchase
B0012GTZC0|5.0|Great book. The smuggler appeared to be a mix of Jason Bourne & Jack Bowen and therefore unbeatable. But never underestimate a woman!
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I just started watching this series.  I did not know what I was missing!!  It can be very bloody so it's not for the squeamish.
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|It had some fun moments, but definitely too depressing over all. Wouldn't want to ever watch again, or recommend to anyone.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun game, runs on kindle fire okay but closes on phone alot, also glitchy but good game overall and don't have to spend a lot of money to play
B0087JTAKW|5.0|What is it about Mitch Albom? I can't help but love everything he writes. Others have criticized his simplistic writing style, but I think it just adds to the beauty of the overall work. One needs not be a scholar to appreciate his writing.<br /><br />This story takes a little bit from the Biblical story of the Tower of Babel and uses that as the basic framework for the setting and part of the plot. It is the story of Father Time -- the first person ever to attempt to measure time -- and the eternal consequences of becoming a slave to the clock. To make amends, the Father of Time must track down one who wants \\"too little time\\" and once who wants \\"too much time\\" and teach them how to appreciate the lives they have.<br /><br />In that way, it is reminiscent of \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" but in a slightly different fashion.<br /><br />As usual, Albom's story is stirring, profoundly wise, and beautiful.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like it so far. can't beat 99 cent alarm clock. enjoy the faces. wish it came with ocean or nature sounds to wake up to.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This show was made as a whim selection and I didn’t expect much from it. I soon found out that this is a very good show with action and adventure.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thought this book was a page turner.  Suprised by the ending but thought about the book and even remembered everything about the plot days afterward.  Confirms the issue of parents with blinders that ignore or refuse to admit the problems of their child.  &#34; Not my kid&#34; is the theme.  I always tried to think my child could do that and worse so I was never shocked. A great read--used for our book club.
B00464AVXW|4.0|This is a great classic movie with a very twisted plot. Not for the younger kids in the house or the faint of heart.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved the series- and even my husband did- never would have expected that.  Great character development and historical progression of the values of different eras.
B00CB3N5DS|5.0|This is a really good martial arts action movie. Intense (realistic) fights with historical facts. Wait for the 10 black belt fight scene.
030758836X|5.0|Every time you think all the surprises are out - SURPRISE there's one more!  I read Gillian Flynn's other 2 novels also.  Readable but not nearly as good a page turner as this one.  Make sure you read this before the movie comes out next year
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|This movie has some pretty cool landscapes and had the potential to be a really cool movie, but it feels like some of the plot is missing. Felt underwhelmed after watching this.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book.  I identified with ALL the characters.  I'll look for more of Moriarty's books. Thank you.

B003UBTX72|5.0|If you like living vicariously through the actions of others, there are few lives that offer more roller-coaster-ride thrills than Keef's. This book is a fantastic read!<br /><br />I'm sure many others will say this, but it's written in a very conversational first-person. It's like you've befriended Keith in a corner of a quiet, cozy pub, and get to hear his tales and anecdotes - all regaled in a dry, witty, good humor that provide numerous belly laughs and frequent chuckles.<br /><br />If you're looking for an upstanding role model, you may want to look elsewhere. This \\"mere minstrel\\"'s faults are many, yet he still comes across as genuine, kindhearted and honest. Above all, you get the distinct impression that, on balance, he has enjoyed his life.<br /><br />Both personally and professionally, his life's ambition comes across strongly as a passionate dedication to his art, rather than a desire to become immensely wealthy (which he achieved in any case). I can't think of too many other rock stars about whom the same could be said. He appears to be never happier than when he is jamming with great musicians. His views on the sterility of modern recording techniques are particularly illuminating.<br /><br />He tells a fascinating tale. From surviving the Blitz and the destruction of his first home in the bombing of WWII, through the meteoric rise of the Stones, and addiction to heroin, to his meandering around the Globe living the life of a rock star, this is never a dull read.<br /><br />There are a few holes in his account, and there are many periods of his life in which he provides scant details - which is probably to be expected, given the nature of his lifestyle for many years.<br /><br />As a Brit now living in the US, I was struck by how distinctively British his vernacular and sense of humor are. It was like chatting to one of my old friends back home! I'm sure that many of his witticisms will go unnoticed or unappreciated by American readers (there is heavy use of self-deprecation, comedic irony and many references to celebrities that few outside the UK will be familiar with), and his language is colorful to say the least, but it should be no less entertaining for that. Similarly, there are many Brits who will not fully appreciate his descriptions of life and attitudes in the US. Then again, I've never been to Morocco, Jamaica, Fiji, etc. but that didn't stop me enjoying his adventures there.<br /><br />It obviously helps if you've ever been a fan of the Stones, making his relationships with his fellow band members, backgrounds to certain songs, and details of recording sessions, particularly interesting.<br /><br />If I had to pick one highlight from the book, it would be his Thanksgiving dinner with his then prospective in-laws on Staten Island. Hilarious!se of self-deprecation, comedic irony and many references to celebrities that few outside the UK will be familiar with), and his language is colorful to say the least, but it should be no less entertaining for that.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Really good book. I would recommend all to read this. Especially before seeing the movie. We all know what happens when Hollywood starts making movies or books we enjoy.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was yet one more fascinating tale. Once I started I wasn't able to put it down. !! An amazing story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldnt put it down and when I did I was thinking about when I was going to get a chance to read it again!
B000J159N8|5.0|Great movie about what leadership should look like. It a glimpse into the mind of a leader that struggles with what he must ask his men to do.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This would seem like a daunting task to bring these very strong characters together into a team without one of them feeling superior but the writer director pulls it off with uncanny ability.  Infused with comedy throughout the drama this film is very balanced and the time just evaporates as your watching it.
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is one of the better games  I have played  in a long while.  I enjoy puzzles  everyone should give this game a try
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Trilogies can be hit or miss in films but this one is superb in that it addresses the human side of Tony Stark and his near death experience with the Avengers.  By making him more human it also makes him more appealing to us all in our everyday failures.  The villain in this movie is very well crafted and timely with a plausible motive (even if somewhat over the top).  Tony meets a new unlikely ally that really adds to the drive of this film.
B00A0B0KFY|5.0|Very informative and an easy read and easy to understand.A much needed book in this day and age,everyone should at least read it once.

B009WUAK2M|3.0|Not bad but it could be better. It has action, explosions and etc. it needs a better story and less famous actors.
1846147506|4.0|Talk about hitting the nail squarely on the head, the publicity material for this thought-provoking book gets it right and sets the tone - more and more are we reading about/watching about food and cookery, it is easier and easier to get ingredients from anywhere in the world yet as a society we eat more and more processed foods and actually cook less. Reheating is not cooking.<br /><br />The author considers the paradox that society seems to be preferring to think about and consume the art of cooking instead of undertaking the exact-same exercise. At the same time \\"we\\" tend to increasingly worry about the origin of ingredients, welfare of animals in our food chain and obsess about our health and diet, whilst shovelling down more and more processed foods. The author's solution is easier said than done: get cooking. This hardback book with an impenetrable academic-sounding title lets you sit on the author's shoulder, looking on as he rediscovers the art and love of cooking by getting out and about, cooking with and using the basic elements of fire, water, air and the earth. Recipes not included.<br /><br />This is not a book that glorifies the celebrity chef world, it doesn't sit and lecture on the evils of factory-produced meals whilst talking up the world of small-scale artisan production. Instead it is a more back to basic, good and honest appreciation, drawing inspiration from many sources and possibly acting as a voyage of rediscovery along the way. It is not going to be a light read, despite it being written in a biography or diary style. It is text, text and more text. No action images of the author doing his stuff, no mouth-watering images, no scenic shots. For a first person book it is surprisingly ego-free too.<br /><br />If you are prepared to put the time in with this book you will probably come away a more inspired, interested and possibly active cook. The book effectively demands participation without being so uncouth as to actually demand it. Inspires would be an insipid word. It just \\"does\\" but short of seeing the book for yourself, sharing in the belief and participating in the process you might not fully appreciate the possible enormity of the changes that may follow. Of course, you might still prefer to sit on the couch, watch a \\"cooking show\\", consume the culinary dream and convince yourself that you are part of the cooking craze or culture, before eating your supermarket-produced ready meal.<br /><br />This book might be one of those lightbulb moments for you that can generate some life-changing moments. Or it might be something you consider is a waste of your money and abandon it in haste. There is probably no middle-ground and quite rightly so.would be an insipid word.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. It is not like the rest which seem to be mind numbing. the puzzles are challenging and this game really makes me think. but not so hard I give up. Ill keep playing.
B00005Y7NK|5.0|With the exception of the pointless intro, this record really rocks.  Headless Cross is a cool song with an awesome solo.  A good song to begin this record.  This leads into Devil and Daughter, which the music alone is worth the price of this cd.  The guitar solo smokes, but this entire record has smoking solos.  But what else would you expect from Iommi.  When Death Calls sounds like a cautionary tale of what will happen if you don't change your life.  Of course, it includes a blistering solo from Iommi.  This is a trend throughout this record, which only gets better as it goes along.  Kill in the spirit world is the only clunker on this record, only because it's a rather generic metal track that could have been written by anyone.  Call of the Wild, Black Moon and Nightwing all seem to go together to make one long song.  Maybe that was the intention.  An excellent ending track for this record.  The story is another case of being cautionary taleish.  This is a very good addition to the Black Sabbath catalog.
B00EY8A6BC|1.0|Amazon seems to think my 32 Mb d/l stream isn't fast enough to show me this movie in HD, so it refused to stream.  Instead, I had to go to VuDu where, for $1.00 more, I got an incredibly fast, seamless, HD movie experience.<br /><br />I'm not sure why Amazon choked, but Vudu took about 3.2 seconds to decide my bandwidth was sufficient, load, and stream.  I tried six different ways to force Amazon to play, but it couldn't seem to deliver the goods.
B00F52YOPA|5.0|I like a story line and this game has it.  There is a time management component but I'm a dreamy type of game player so I was glad to see that the timer could be disabled.  Since I can't afford to decorate my home, this virtual one is very satisfactory!
B00F2362IE|5.0|this game is very action packed and interactive. the only bad part is the bufering and long download. it took a while to down laid and after. a turpentine time it has a wait then starts again. after the third it fr eezes for good
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|A Beautiful Mind.  This is one beautiful movie.  Based on the life of still-living mathematician, John Forbes Nash, Jr., the film deals with Ivy League genius, schizophrenia, cracking Russian codes, and love.  Director Ron Howard and Russell Crowe as Nash lead the way in creating a near perfect film.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|A good story, football, emotion, acting, humor--this movie has a little bit of everything to make it great for a variety of people. All the while with some great messages that are often forgotten in today's movies.
B003YL4KS0|5.0|The facts in here are things every girl with any kind of pattern should know when learning their hair. Know what works for you and what doesn't is second but knowing your hair is first.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Red is without a doubt one of the best movies I've seen. It's funny with a lot of action and female protagonists that won't make you cringe or roll your eyes at their stereotypical portrayal. The movie is a fantastic combination of everything you could desire in a movie without having to cover any young eyes. The actors were perfect and the story was climatic, and simply amazing.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I wanted a game that would challenge. me..... and this one fits the bill !! You will find yourself unable to put it down.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Losing interest in game when its always freezing and doesn't always give correct credits. would rate a three. Will be finding another game to play.
B00DHRLK84|4.0|The movie is great and I really like it, but in my opinion the 3D version, after watching the unrated version, is just too watered down.  The 3D looks great, but about a quarter into the movie I stopped it and put in the unrated version.<br /><br />If you have seen the unrated version, don't get this hoping to see it again in 3D.  You will be disappointed.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|Great book!!!! Chock full of life transforming wisdom on every page. Amazon is making me add more words to write a review but there is nothing more to say

B004FGMV0W|5.0|My name is Steve, I grew up in the late 70s , early 80s, I grew up with bands such as the CARS, Blondie,  the Police , Pink Floyd, the Who, Motley Crue , Guns N Roses, Yes, Danger Danger , Kiss, Bon Jovi ,and  but yet I still fell for  Avril Lavigne.  Avril always wrote songs  that had the deepest meaning and emotion. My favorite song on here  is What The Hell , followed by Alice , written for the motion picture and then the punky Smile and loving Goodbye Lullabye. IF you look at overall she isnt just one musica genre because there is contemporary in this albun as well.  I cant get the songs out of my head. The songs in this album , everyone can relate too because Avril writes her own lyrics. Disney didnt create Avril , Avril created Avril. the girl is innovative  multitalented and she is still the same. She doesnt use autotune because her voice is phenominal without autotune or playback. I love you Avril!

B00F5BON8O|4.0|We really enjoyed her last album.  This one has much more complexity to it.  Also, seems she really resonates with her 'trio'.  Seems strange to hear such relaxed rythms from one so young.  Mile on the Moon is a great example.  If you liked her last one, this one will grow on you, if you don't like it off the bat.  She is developing 'her muse'.  Great to watch.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|This show is just insane. I can't believe I didn't watch it from the start. The first 3 episodes were beyond any tv show I've seen before!

B008Y212PI|5.0|You have wonderful reviews regaling the awesomeness of this game.  I'll concur with them.  What I discovered, though, is that the developer seems to have looked at previous game reviews and made two lists: To Do, and Not To Do - those are the questions he answered.<br /><br />This game, while having internet access, is devoid of any other concerns or permission issues. Grade: A<br /><br />The game has a very detailed and engaging tutorial. Grade: A+<br /><br />The developer put a lot of thought into the graphics and sound effects. Grade: A+<br /><br />The developer gives you the entire game. Wait a minute... there's a locked bonus puzzle? Well, yes, there is a locked bonus puzzle.  However, the developer gave NON-FACEBOOK USERS another method to unlock the bonus puzzle by simply reviewing the game.  But wait.. there's more! You don't even have to leave a review! All you need to do is simply click the link and then press your back button. Puzzle unlocked.  Grade: B.<br /><br />Obviously, I'd like to see the bonus puzzle already unlocked, but its easy enough to get unlock it without having to deal with Facebook. Some music might be nice, maybe something themed for each painting.  Still, not necessary.  Really, the only thing I feel really would help this game would be to give a bigger separation between the paint brush and the hammer.  It's too easy to accidentally hit the one you didn't want.<br /><br />None of the issues warrant reducing a star. Indeed, this game should serve as an example of how to listen to your customers and offer a great game people are glad to have purchased.<br /><br />Final Grade: A<br /><br />[EDIT: oops. typo.]

B000FCKIFU|4.0|Having read over 20 of Baldaccis's thrillers, The Camel Club is one of his real treats!  While many of his novels don't hold that well together this one does.  It is a great read filled with suspense.  The character development is good and the plot, seeming impossible to pull together , does so in the end.  For those of you not familiar with David's writing, I would recommend The Forgotten - one of his best.
B00846REIS|5.0|I thought it was an interesting story to read, considering I first thought it would be like &#34;Fifty Shades&#34;, but the development of the characters makes the clicked enough to continue reading the other 2 books.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love to play this one.  It is my favorite for bedtime, wind down, ready for sleep game.  Seems to be more simple than other solitaire games but it still is fun to play.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read it in one day I couldn't put it down...... the ending was gorgeous... now onto the next book (:
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is another favorite Solitaire games.  It is easy to play, fun to pick up when you need to rest for a moment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Not only is it the good news, but it also has plans that you can complete within a year, 5 weeks, 10 days whatever your preference.  I also enjoy the plan by Joyce Meyers &#34;Promises for you Everyday&#34;.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Super. Excellent!!!! I love to watch this series.  Can't merit unt season 4.  One of the best series I have watched!!!
006079383X|1.0|I could not get through the first CD. Contains nothing more than wall street jargon thrown around with absolutely no structure at all. I've read plenty of books on investing and I can confidently say this is the worst. I was really looking forward to it as it seemed like it would be straight from the book by Ben Graham but with the 3 hour run time, I'm not sure what the content is actually from. Thoroughly disappointed and I hope this review prevents others from making the same mistake.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I love hidden object games. This one seems to be a step above the norm. Neat prizes and good variety
B0067TGSOK|4.0|Generally speaking $100 Startup is thoughtful book based on research of successful small business stories. It took me about 8 hours to read it, so it's quite easy to read.<br /><br />Critics<br /><br />In my view it portrays overoptimistic picture of micro business and tells only about bright side of reality. When your boss says \\"I am sorry, we have to let you go \\", you should immediately dance and celebrate feeling of \\"own boss\\". The book has nothing about relationship risk for the entrepreneur, who just started with no immediate profits. There is no statistics, how many of microbusiness fail to compare with success stories. And so on...<br /><br />Take for instance my own entrepreneurship experience.  I have created and published two mobile apps with personal finance news from most popular US and Canadian bloggers. I invested a lot of my free time in the app, it's free, and I am paying $60 per month to app development company. I thought the apps would be really useful for people, but during first month I had only 40 downloads. Moreover, I am not sure how many users actually read the news because of technical problems with statistics.<br />Also $100 startup leans towards \\"mom and pop\\" shops and hobby businesses. It won't help in expanding the operations.<br /><br />Anyway, there are quite a few good moments, that make $100 worth reading:<br />- Lots of inspiring small stories from small businesses (particularly first one about mattresses)<br />- Advice on starting business , explanation of feature vs benefit<br />- Example on prioritizing possibilities list<br />- Marketing launch tips (I liked \\"you can't please all of them\\" example) and checklist<br />- Reminder that business is not only about passion, it must earn profit<br /><br /> Recommendations:<br /><br />If you need an inspiration to start entrepreneurial lifestyle, it's the marvelous book to read.<br /><br />If you want to open small bakery, publish first ebook etc - you'd better read more industry specific things.<br />And talk to different entrepreneurs to learn about both sides of the coin.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Both Star Wars editions of Angry Birds are a lot of fun.  There are more than enough levels to keep an avid gamer busy.  Koodoos to Amazon.com to keep Kindle owners up to date on the games everyone loves.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|It was so wonderful to complete the story of Danny.  I've always wondered what happened to Doc. Read this book.
B003B02O7I|5.0|This was a somewhat different book from Grisham. It was a legal thriller but at a much slower pace and while it raised many moral & philosophical questions, it never preached at the reader. It ended rather abruptly and left both you & Nate, the main character at the beginning of a new adventure.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is awesome because it's really exciting and you get into the game like if you die you will scream and then you will try again and again unroll you finally move up you speed!!!! I hope you love this game as much as I do.

B00542USJW|5.0|This was a great movie from my childhood and now I have it on DVD! I Couldn't be happier than I am.
B0094K20FK|5.0|My children decided they wanted to know more about Khan, so we grabbed all the Khan shows we could and had a Khan marathon... the movies stayed pretty close to the original plot.... pretty cool.
B00422LESO|4.0|This was a very cute book.  Very good beach reading.  I would definitely recommend for the romantic in your life.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I just listened to this remix as I walked across Lake Murray Dam this morning, and the sound and clarity is amazing!  It really is a noticeable improvement and the music now has a multilayered atmosphere of clear highs, mids, and lows: it has a bubbling liveliness that sounds great more than a decade later!<br /><br />I just played the original \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" versus the new remixed version and it serves as a good example of the wonderful difference with the muddy, murky veil lifted from these beautiful songs!  Even the album artwork reflects this change with the former cover being a flat, 2D image and the newer one is rounded and more 3D.<br /><br />The frog has finally been transformed!
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Have you forgotten all your high school French or German or Spanish? Or would you like to pick up a new language? Duolingo is a great way to learn or to relearn. All the vocabulary and sentences are pronounced and the activities are varied to keep up your interest.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Amazing original show with fantastic cast. Really enjoyed watching and still watching other seasons. I just cant stop watching it.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|I started this book and enjoyed the history of the tribes. It was well written and I look forward to reading future books!
B00E66QPCG|5.0|Always searching for sound financial advice, I checked out A Simple Strategy, which is a guide to help you trade stocks. I am new to trading and have been searching for a trading strategy that doesn't require proprietary indicators or sophisticated charting software packages. And I'm glad I found this book. I am using ThinkOrSwim and have been able to replicate the settings as described in this book (besides coloring of the bars). I use 5 minute charts instead of range bars, and it's easy for me to identify the entries of this strategy. Overall the strategy is easy to understand, and I like the fact that the authors providing realistic expectations. Highly recommended, especially for beginners like myself.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Vapor Trails was always a very strong album -- in terms of the songs themselves. Miles better than Test For Echo, and arguably better than Snakes & Arrows, too. Thse great songs were buried in an awful \\"wall-of-sound\\" production that actually induced a headache when you listened to it. I kid you not -- the album actually gave me a headache (and it wasn't \\"my favorite headache,\\" either). But now? These terrific songs, buried in the muck and mire, have been resurrected and given a new life, and they sound fantastic. Clear separation of the instruments for the first time reveals nuances in these songs that you just could not hear before.<br /><br />Enjoy Vapor Trails again...for the first time.
B00F5BON8O|5.0|Sarah Jarosz has an amazing voice.  I am surprised she has not achieved more wide-spread acclaim.  I find her voice very mellow and soothing.  There is not one bad song among the bunch.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Great movie.  If you love fast paced, somewhat gory, zombie movies then you will love this.  Action started within minutes and kept me on the edge of my seat until the end.  I loved it and can't wait for a part 2.  I was not disappointed. Was unsure if I'd like Brad Pitt in this, but he was excellent.
0743270754|5.0|Easy, fluid, and visualized narrative. Page after page the author walks the reader trough historical events that feel, in these pages, like family stories.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|tHis is a awesome game thhat. the results are never the same. The only thing is i have a hard time with stopping the cure
B00C5R7F8G|5.0|This is one of those books that I haven't been able to put down. The story of Titan II accident in Damascus Arkansas was an obscure footnote in history, but the telling of the story illustrates how much the government and specifically the military has to endure to keep our nuclear strategy in place. The mixing of the story and the history of the deployment of nuclear weapons, and the risks we have collectively subject to, is provacative and sobering. I hope this is read objectively by anyone who deals with these nuclear matters daily, so they don't deal with it routinely.
B001IF277K|5.0|This is a new battery.  It is an exact replacement for the Xperia.  It worked exactly as it should right out of the &#34;box&#34;.  I arrived in a very timely manner and was in perfect condition.  Thanks.
B00CKKDZ2S|4.0|I personally think this is a neat app, the first time I read It was so dead on, I had been sick really sick with the flu. I pulled the health  card telling me to take care of myself, physically and emotionally, I had been neglecting myself. Ha I was amazed!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|We have a lot of fun with the free race but we can't buy all the add on's for all the games.  It is fun what we can do but almost, if not impossible, to get past a certain point without upgrades.  It's free but it's not free.<br />vol n al
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, entertaining, and educational--perfect combination for a game! We're so glad Amazon offers these apps for the tablets. Free is great but even the paid games are reasonably priced. Thank You!
B005MMYEF8|5.0|One of the most enjoyable, top 5 series I've seen.  Quality is the keyword here for: Acting, script, special effects!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Great game loads of fun you should download, easy to lay can decide?  to be one of four different warrior classes
B000SW16M6|5.0|Also the train ride with Tom and Rebecca is one of the sexiest scenes ever.  You can almost feel the earth move!  =D<br /><br />It's not short on humor either.  Don't dismiss this film for any reason. (You can thank me later.)  It's a WINNER.<br /><br />So pour two glasses of wine and invite someone you really like to watch it with you.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|Beautifully written, gentle story, breaking out of your mould and creating a new purpose for yourself. A small act of courage.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Daniel Day-Lewis rarely, if ever, disappoints us.  Am I right?  This film is no exception.<br /><br />It's NOT about Lincoln's assassination. It is about the man, the office, dealing with crisis and greatness.
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|It never occurred to me that Paul Anka would produce anything but great. There were a number of &#34;partners&#34; that I thought were less than stellar. Would not recommend.
B000YMQI6E|5.0|Every aspect of this film was enthralling.  It's a puzzle for the viewer to solve along with the investigators.<br /><br />It's never a secret as to WHO done it.  The mystery is HOW?!  See if you can figure it out before all clues are revealed.<br /><br />This is a film you'll want to see more than once in order to appreciate how cleverly the crime was committed.<br /><br />Save this one for a night when you really need to see a terrific film with a friend!
B00BCG1ZQO|4.0|After literally forcing my way through the last season I am glad to see that the writers of Supernatural have finally, FINALLY changed things up a bit.  Ever since the arrival of Cass and his heavenly host, the show became a bit monotonous- angels, the devil, Crowley, Lilith- I was getting tired of them (not Cass, though- too loveable)!  The first few episodes of Season 8 had some of those same themes, but later, much to my delight, things change for the better.  I don't want to ruin anything with accidental spoilers, but it's safe to say that I'm seeing Sam and Dean in a different light this season and I like it! Can't wait to see what happens next.
B00ENBS4GO|3.0|It was too depressing to watch them lose the battle and suffer the known consequences.  But it was great till then!
B002HSSAY6|2.0|While this movie did contain every stereotype you have ever seen in a western, it was also painfully slow moving at times, confusing, and misogynistic.
B00E9P959O|5.0|When Retrospective 3 was released, I could not wait to hear how One Little Victory and Earthshine sounded all cleaned up. Of course, I was impressed with the new life those songs received from engineer Richard Chycki. When I listened to the new and improved Vapor Trails streamed over my PC, I was amazed to hear there are differences in Chycki's remix and the new release. I was surprised to find out yet another engineer was chosen to remake VT - David Bottrill.<br /><br />I listened to the new VT, and was amazed at the clarity. I could hear bass notes individualized, sparkle in Alex's guitar playing, and notes Geddy sang which I'd not yet heard. I am quite pleased. I also hear effects not previously heard, such as an echo on the lead vocal for Freeze. There is balance between the lead vocal and the backup vocals, so that the listener can tell them apart. Definitely a must for the Rush fanatic.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|You know I'd just prefer to give stars and not have to write something here.  I can do that at Netflix but don't always have time to write and actual review.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|What a nothing story. I only finished it after the plot was revealed to see if there wasn't something else coming but , no, there wasn't. I like my science fiction dark and thick not trivialized. Maybe I have no sense of the ironic so if you do not stay away from this book.
B00F3HQMV6|5.0|Started listening to their EP's several months ago and fell in love with this group.  Yasmine and Jahan are the total package; superstars in the making.  Talented writers and singers, charismatic, beautiful, passionate...what more can you say, they have the &#34;it&#34; factor.
B00EL8I8IS|5.0|Great movie for anyone into zombies and world ending movies , i loved it because when i saw it at the drive in , it was so dark i couldn't even see it , so when i bought it through amazon , i was so excited to see it , was worth the money , id watch it again and again and again , great movie brad pit !!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys period dramas and history. It is well written and acted. The cinematography is also excellent.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Like all the Game of Thrones books, I loved this one.  But I was glad to have the Kindle and be able to navigate back and forth between the 2 books that take place in parallel.  Looking forward to the next one!
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|Exercises the brain. One really has to think to complete the puzzles. Great way to use spare time while enjoying oneself.
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|As a working mom, someone recommended this book and I bought it thinking I would find it interesting and no more.  I have found myself identified in many of her descriptions, I loved her writing style and I admit I felt better every time I read a chapter!  It made me feel less alone and put words and descriptions on feelings and situations I have lived through.  I highly recommend it to all moms - especially working moms!
B006AZZPCM|4.0|It's fairly good. Not too shabby. Could use a UI upgrade. Has ads popping up all over. And any time I want to navigate away from an app, it has the app I want to go to as well as tubemate. It gets kind of annoying.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|It started out well, but at a point in time I wasn't sure whether I was to laugh or cry...  When pieces of arms and fingers were coming off the zombies, I knew I was supposed to laugh!  Entertaining, but that's it.

161218412X|5.0|I had been eyeing this product for a while, and received it as a gift recently. It is so pretty! I love the colors, and all the details and pictures on the cover, spine and back of each novel! I'm also pleased it is a COMPLETE collection, meaning it has all the novels AND short stories! I love this Sherlock Holmes collection to pieces!!
0525478817|5.0|If you haven't picked up this gem of a book and read it, then I suggest you do so! John Green knows how to write a book from a perspective that he's never experienced before (a 16 year old girl with cancer) and make you feel the emotion as felt by the character. I can't wait for the movie!
B005LAIISU|5.0|The Ice Age movies are some of my favorite movies! My 3yr old daughter loves them too! The characters are done well, the animation is great and the music keeps us dancing!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was not what I expected. What a wonderful romance! Highly recommend and will look forward to reading more from Mira Lyn Kelly.

B00DAPOHU6|3.0|I have listened to this collection by Jack Johnson once.  That is my opinion.  I will give it a try again, but I am sure I will not listen to it as regularly as his other offerings I have purchased.  It just doesn't seem to be inspired by any enthusiam or the desire to write good music like most of his other songs.  Sorry to have to write this review.
B00BRUPICM|3.0|I thought this book a bit too graphic for me.  Although I enjoyed the story line I really had trouble with the torture and inhumane treatment.  Also, I could easily figure out the who/what/when/where and why.
B00000331V|5.0|As I said about the Showtime album......These guys are a fantastic band...and even better LIVE.<br /><br />They did t.hreelive albums during their peak years....and there is barely any repeat songs<br /><br />The mastering is superb and the performance is energized......A must have.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|The herd has pulled it off once again! The new character &#34;Buck&#34; is a ham and adds another story within the story much like the squirrel and acorn does.  Appropriate for 8yo and up I suppose due to some scary loud dinosaurs.  I did have some difficulty downloading the movie &#34;due to slow connection&#34; which I doubted cause a speed test on my end indicated 15 Mbps...hunh. Anyhow another hit by Ice Age
B003477DVK|4.0|Such a cute movie! My boys (14, 6, 3) all loved it! It is great when you find a movie the whole family can enjoy!
0307987647|5.0|I'll just name some stand out parts of A Clash Of Kings audiobook: 1. The conversation between Catelyn Stark and Jamie Lannister while Jamie is being held captive. Jamie is a tell-it-like-it-is kind of guy and he did so with Cat. I found the conversation informative and funny. Jamie is a charmer. 2. Tyrion's conversation with the pyromancer about his ability to make wildfire so fast (any dragons alive?) 3. Ayra and her bad-ass ability to survive! I just want to see her and Jon Snow reunited, forget about anyone else. They're siblings who could rule it all. 4. Jaqen H'ghar, you mysterious little devil, please reappear in the books soon. I'm intrigued! Oh, I could go on but I don't need to sell anyone on these books because if you started them you will finish them. A shout-out to Roy Dotrice who reads the audiobooks, you are marvelous!
B009RX85N0|5.0|this is such an awesome tv serious it should become a classic, I recommend this has a family tv show
B008JGSM6G|3.0|I really like the challenge of connecting the pipes. However, some of my correct moves don't complete the Level. My moves are shown as not complete, even though they are.

B00F35BV64|5.0|I have loved this star trek as much as the first by JJ Abrams, love this cast and the addition of Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn is great!
B0042C1BP0|4.0|Although this movie is 7 years old, it is still very good. Riveting and it keeps your attention. The only problem is the 30 minutes of slack after the poker tournament, takes away from the rest of a great movie.

B00BRUPICM|4.0|Very unpredictable! It held my interest right from the beginning. New author for me, would read more by this author.
B009JZWO3I|4.0|The 4th season was terrific after the stupid plot between Calinda and her drug dealing husband. I wonder where he went but hope that never comes back that she killed him because the whole story line sucked. If it weren't for that part of the season, it would have been an A PLus! The rest of the season, the campaign, the increasing story lines with the kids who are awesome actors, the money woes, the partner conflicts... all great. Calinda story line with her idiot husband (a man it seemed like she would never marry) was the only downfall of the entire season. Thrilled to get past it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I lost some sleep over these books--from staying up late at night to read them, and staying awake in bed over the dread or wonder of what was going to happen to the characters next.  I ended up sitting in a parking lot (after an appointment) to finish up.  Excellent writing, thoughtful themes, not always predictable.  Good stuff; I have found a great author to put on my \\"favorites\\" list.
B005PK57NU|5.0|It's not just good, the Good Wife is Great! Love the interactions, the characters, the tension, the suspense. The cases are great, the actors are great! Terrific show!

MANY PROBLEMS ARE OVERCOME AND EVEN WAR TOUCHES THE SCENE MAKING THE END MORE INTERESTING AND SHOWING HOW ONE STICKS TO IT TO GET IT DONE AGAIN IN CASE YOU MISSED THE FIRST TIME. A COMPLETELY CHANGED SCENE KEEPING US KEENLY INTERESTED TO THE END.  ONE COULD SAY IS IS SLOW IN SPOTS. [ALSO, YOU HAVE TO CHOOSE NO CAPTIONS IN THE VERY BEGINNING WHICH IS STRANGE]

B00BEIYP1W|4.0|Theatrical review.<br /><br />Ron Howard, like most directors, has had his share of hits and misses.  His one previous \\"sports\\" movie was the underappreciated \\"Cinderella Man\\" from 2005.  He takes another stab with this exhilarating film which depicts the competition between two men who are polar opposites except in their desire to win.  Winning means taking the Formula 1 driving championship of 1976.<br /><br />Based on real characters and real events, Chris Hemsworth (\\"Thor\\") plays British playboy James Hunt.  His nemesis is unlikeable and demanding, but determined and detailed.  Austrian driver, Niki Lauda (Daniel Bruhl, \\"Inglourious Basterds\\") is more focused on the curves of the race course than on the curves on a woman.  We see the two drivers beginning in the smaller F3 circuit.  But both are impatient.  Lauda has access to money and buys his way in to F1 with his investment.  Hunt is sponsored by British Lord Hesketh (Christian McKay), a man with money but even he has his limits.  Two women enter their lives.  Model Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde) eventually becomes Mrs. Hunt.  And why not?  I couldn't help but think I've not seen 2 more beautiful people on screen at one time than Hemsworth and Wilde.  I digress.  By accident, the unpopular Lauda meets Marlene (Alexandra Maria Lara), a romantic partner of actor Curd Jurgens.  Marlene becomes a strong influence on Niki, eventually bringing out a more humanistic side, especially after his near fatal crash.  Suzy and James are in a crash and burn relationship of a different kind.<br /><br />This movie, however is about the relationship and the competitive nature between Hunt and Lauda.  That is their one link.  Competition.  It brings out the best and the worst of each.  Hemsworth and Bruhl give terrific performances.  Howard, aided by Peter Morgan's screenplay gives cautioned insight into what makes each man tick.  It's a simple story really.  Each motivates the other.  Each wants to be the best.  Their approaches are different and they are certainly of different personalities.  Hunt is gifted, popular and loves the life that goes with the job.  For Lauda, less athletic perhaps, but uses the science of the sport and strong work ethic to become better.<br /><br />Hans Zimmer adds a very good musical score to the film and the editing is first rate.  I would also be remiss if not mentioning the spectacular racing scenes shot by cinematographer Anthony Dod Mantle.  They are numerous and even for someone not particularly interesting in auto racing, exciting and spectacular.  There are never two races that seem the same, either from the way they are shot or by the racing environment.  The races shot during driving rain storms are harrowing.  Find yourself a great seat in the middle and in front of a big screen and engulf yourself with as many speakers as you can find.  It's a great ride.are different and they are certainly of different personalities.  Hunt is gifted, popular and loves the life that goes with the job.

B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this app.  It has levels and badges and awards and offers instant feedback in manageable doses.  You have to pass one level to get to the next.  I'm addicted, in a good way.  Just as much fun as Angry Birds to me!
0062255657|3.0|I started this yesterday, and finished it today, but, back in the days I had nothing but reading time, I could have finished it in a few hours. It was compelling enough to keep going through the 170+ pages, but I felt the very predictability of it. Gaiman's done this before, and done it better. This book feels very similar to Coraline - the same sense of a World Out of Ours. Things work out differently here (a hint of King's \\"Langoliers\\" comes into play), but there is no new material here.<br /><br />The characters never developed, either. The narrator was never given a name (an homage to \\"Rebecca,\\" perhaps, but a throwaway here). Gaiman is at his best when the reader cares about his characters, but, it seems, even HE didn't care about these enough to round them out. And he had plenty of room to do so.<br /><br />Mind you, I've been a Gaiman fan since BEFORE Sandman. I loved his MarvelMan pieces, and everything else I could find. \\"Good Omens\\" remains at the very top of my Very Favorite Books of All Time list, and \\"Neverwhere\\" isn't very far behind.<br /><br />His writing is still stellar, which is why I'm giving this three stars. The story's been done before, and been done better, by the same writer.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I always get RUSH albums the second I can get my hands on them.  While I loved VT, it actually made my ears tired listening to it.  I remember telling my friends how much the songs were cool, but it just didn't crank -- even though the playing was obviously amazing.  A year later, there was talk about the mastering and a possible future release.  The RUSH IN RIO set just underscored that.  The VT songs sounded so much better in that setting.<br /><br />Well, today I got the remixed version of VT.  In the opening seconds, you can tell the difference.  Guitar parts I don't recall ever hearing before, complete clarity in everything.  Obviously a few small surprises were added back in, but they just add to the enjoyment of a wonderful record finally coming to life.  If you like Rush at all, or just like hard rock and need something fresh, do yourself a BIG favor and pick this up.  I also agree with the other reviewer about the Tool and Porcupine Tree mastering.<br /><br />The difference in energy makes it a new album, not a rehash. See ya
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|In a wonderful story of British Naval intrigue, set in the latter third of the 19th century, O'Brian weaves a complex account of the adventures, the service, and the refreshing authenticity of Master and Commander Jack Audrey. Captivating, and historically accurate in some great degree of detail, the story is engrossing and thought provoking. The author brings his characters to life. I am reading the series through for the fourth time!
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Love this entire series.  I would recommend this series to everyone who likes sci-fi or just British shows in general.
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I did a lot of poking around before I settled on the 2i2. At the time, I wasn't sure I needed real studio monitors. Once I came to the conclusion a pair of decent monitors were a good idea, the search became a lot easier. I've got the 2i2 hooked up to a set of Equator D5 monitors using XLR cables (also from Amazon), and they sound great.<br /><br />The drivers seem solid. I have very low latency when using this interface with Ableton Live and my Push controller. I have not experienced any stability issues. The Focusrite interface is an easy recommendation.
B001EBYMB2|5.0|As a Viet Nam veteran I found this movie to be the most realistic of those that I have watched.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This book is amazing!  I love reading really good books.  Especially this one, because it's easy to read and understand.
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This album is a example well thought out, thought provoking excellence. The production and compositions are truly inspiring... you'll be glad that you bought it .
B007YJS7G4|5.0|I loved the movie.  It shows the importance of teamwork and discipline to accomplish a goal.  We are all the same regardless of color.
B0082FPIY8|4.0|Writing about the loss of your mother must be very hard. The love Cheryl had for her was evident in the first chapter of the book. She was so devastated. I had to read on to see how she coped. An inspiration to us all.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I can count on one hand the books that have truly engrossed me. This was one of them. I've never had a pet, but I will never look at dogs (or people, or myself, for that matter) the same way again. Thank you, Garth Stein, for sharing this gift with world.
B0081336FO|5.0|Great acting, great writing, great filming and great fun to watch.  I completely enjoyed this season and am looking forward to Season 3
B00EE3FVSU|2.0|This series was very well-acted and had high production values, but the ending felt way out of left field. It seemed like the writers were just trying to go for the usual &#34;shocking twist,&#34; but this sort of &#34;shocking twist&#34; now feels rather overdone. The series on the whole is so carefully written and feels so realistic that it would actually have been more interesting to me (paradoxically) if the solution to the crime had turned out to be more mundane.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|I enjoy many of King's books, but I am not a solid, diehard fan. I didn't care much for Tommyknockers, Christine or Insomnia. However, many of his books are on my list of favorites and include Bag of Bones, Duma Key, Misery and The Shining. In fact, I listen to or read these favorites sometimes twice a year. I've listened to The Shining audiobook twice this year. I used The Shining in a plot study in a writing exercise once. So, I had great expectations for Doctor Sleep, though I understood that The Shining would be a tough act to follow. I was let down by Wind through the Keyhole, the new addition to the Gunslinger series, so I understood that Doctor Sleep might not be on the same level as The Shining. I felt I had more realistic expectations. Still, I was disappointed.<br /><br />I had some of the same feelings about Doctor Sleep that I had when I read Wind through the Keyhole. Much beloved characters seemed forced to me, not natural, not real, just not the same. Danny, now Dan, wasn't particularly interesting. Wendy and Dick just didn't feel like the same people. I was excited to find out what happened to Dan, but the story isn't really about him. I don't get to know him at all. I read about some AA meetings and get to see some memories, but the detailed, realistic characterization I've come to expect from King was absent. I read somewhere that Doctor Sleep went through some extensive editing, and I wonder if the usual King characterization was edited out. I know some people find it all unnecessary and slow, but I've come to really enjoy those detailed descriptions. Another example, if the little girl, Abra. I have always thought King has a real aptitude for writing children, all people really, but in particular children. I thought a recent work, 11-22-63, had some well written children, and Under the Dome was good as well, though I didn't really like the story as much, so I know he still has it. If an editor somewhere edited all the detailed characterization typical of King, please don't, I miss it.<br /><br />As for the story itself, I found it rather drawn out, a little slow, a little boring, perhaps because I didn't care for the characters. I was never drawn in. I've read some really long books, some of them by King, such as Bag of Bones. I like long books. I love a long, long journey, but only if it's an interesting one. Doctor Sleep felt more like a cross between Insomnia, The Regulators, The Firestarter (and not the really good parts of Firestarter) and Dreamcatcher. These books, except for Firestarter are on my \\"eh\\" list, so maybe that's why I didn't for it. The suspense wasn't suspenseful, the thrills not thrilling, the scary things not scary. Honestly, it just didn't feel like a King book to me. I kept wondering if an editor cut out all the King specific nuances that I have come to expect and invest in. I bought both the audible audiobook and the kindle ebook and I am regretting spending the money on both. I don't regret reading it, it's just I don't think I'll be reading it again. I was going to buy a hardback for my collection, but now I'm glad I didn't. I probably won't.<br /><br />Overall, it wasn't a bad book. It just wasn't particularly interesting. It was a pretty long slog for me. I put the audio version on \\"fast\\" to get through it faster. The narrator did a great job. He tried his best to introduce tension and suspense where there wasn't any, thrills where there weren't any.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the book.  I could barely put it down.  However, I am waiting to let my 6th grader read it due to the violence.  Looking forward to the movie.
B00F2LIV4E|5.0|Amazing range of songs on this album.  It's as if they went back to the Images & Words mentality.  Can't wait to see them live.
B004TN7QPG|1.0|I can't really say anything about this App!  After purchasing it, the application has not showed up on either of my Kindles or on my computer.  Maybe some day when it finally comes I'll be able to make a review.
B006PW0F52|5.0|A very entertaining book and an interesting insight into how we fool ourselves. Plenty of food for thought in the way we behave and the choices we make
B00DHHWXYY|1.0|I had very high hopes for the new Gatsby movie as I really enjoyed the old one. However, I was very unimpressed. The acting was ok at best and the musical tracks used were absolutely awful. Had the music used actually fit the movie and/or the time frame I may have liked it more.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The quick and dirty:<br /><br />Q: Is this worth reading?<br />A: Absolutely!<br /><br />Q: Is this worth paying for?<br />A: Yes, and then some!<br /><br />Q: Ahh, but did you enjoy enough to read more of the Silo Saga?<br />A: Just as soon as I'm done lathering praise on this already lathered with praise omnibus, I will purchasing the next installment.<br /><br />After scanning Amazon's books by popularity I came across this and another \\"post-apocalyptic\\" novel. The other (which shall remain nameless) I read for about two pages before putting down for good. Deleted it from my Kindle. Can't even stand to look at it anymore. Stilted speech, overly type cast characters, blah. Wool on the other hand, captivated me from the beginning. Characters that hook you from the beginning. A unique twist on the ole post-apocalyptic yarns. Hints of Shakespearean tragedies. Slow playing sub plots that enhance rather than detract from the story. All add up to one of the most enjoyable reads I've had since Hyperion.<br /><br />I prefer longer series that I can get invested in. Authors not afraid to create new worlds as playgrounds and stages for their actors to grow in. These are the reasons (along with some stellar reviews)that I chose to pick this up. I am writing this review purely based my appreciation for a good story and my hope that others will discover another great read (though with 6000+ reviews I'm not sure mine is necessary).<br /><br />p.s. True but embarrassing story: thirty pages left and my Kindle's battery died! What to do? Can't wait long enough for the battery to charge for me to read. So...let's read it on my PC with the Kindle cloud reader. Yep, that's how bad I had to finish the story. Had to finish it on a computer monitor!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Spoiler Alert...<br />Despite the sheer size of this tome, it didn't provide enough about any one character to suit me. And the last time we're at the wall, was extremely upsetting!  Jon Snow must go on & prove himself the only suitable consort to Queen Daenerys.
B000GCFX3Q|5.0|This is actually a re read for me. Marion Keyes has such wonderful characters. While her books are wonderful in any sequence you read them, the first is Watermelon. Laugh, cry and love. I am jealous if you are reading it for the first time.
B005ZB91KY|5.0|I love the casting. I thought the writing was excellent. There was action and some humor thrown into it too.  Having grown up reading Captain America, I thought this was done almost as well as it could have been.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I type better now.
B00E0SX118|4.0|The Croods was a fun family movie! It was very funny, and the storyline did not lag. I would recommend this movie.

1476727651|1.0|Like many other fans - I had this book pre-ordered and was looking forward to a sequel to a great book.  I've been reading King since I was a child and sometimes I didn't even understand what I reading until I re-read some books as an adult.<br /><br />Possible spoilers<br /><br />Anyhow - this was such a disappointment.  Why does King have to rely on child rape, abduction, abuse and murder?  It just makes me sick to my stomach to read.  It didn't add anything to the story - it just seemed like a sad attempt to be radical and/or have villians.  The True Knot were obnoxious and unbelievable.  Finally little Danny just grew up to be his dad.  I get the redemption plot line that Jack never got a chance to have but again - predictable.  It was really the Dead Zone from the second half.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This book is brilliant - the 'experiments' are so simple and easy to undersrtand, and the way it is written is entertaining -the outcomes really surprised me! How to change your life by changing the way you think! Brilliant!
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I guess I should have payed closer attention to the capabilites of this little dongle when I bought it....My HOPE was that anything and everthing on my cellphone, an HTC One, ....INCLUDING mirroring of the phone, would whiz wirelessy thru my home wi-fi network to my big, beautiful 50\\" plasma TV screen. As of today, the Chromecast cannot do this. Perhaps it's coming in the near future, let's hope.<br /><br />As it is, it does a decent job of streaming the lone 4 apps that it advertises on the box that will stream to your TV.... netflix and youtube worked well, although I'm not entirely sold the audio quality and video quality is quite on par with my blu-ray player..., it is also  supposed to stream googleplay music, but I think the music has to reside in the cloud , like a google account or something....This is a bummer, as I haven't fully jumped into the move to the cloud as of yet....so a big chunck of my 15 gigabytes of uncompressed music files are on my cellphone, and the Chromecast will not stream them from phone to TV.... nor all my personal pics, vidoes and assorted other media.<br /><br />This inability to stream local media..on your phone, on your pc (without using the Chrome browser + extentions,etc) is by far such a large drawback that I'm actually thinking of returning it, and perhaps buy it at a later time when it does have the functionality, or, keep it since it is so inexpensive, and try the HTC Media Hub, which DOES wirelessly send all your phone media and even mirror exactly what you see on your phone to the TV , with no hoops to jump through or caveats.<br /><br />These days, most people with a TV new enough to include HDMI ports, very likely ALREADY have the means to stream Netflix and Youtube and other web content with the TV's built in internet apps software.....what would REALLY put the Chromecast over the top for me, is 100% seamless streaming of anything and everything on my HTC One mobile phone, including mirroring I mentioned earlier....Maybe that day is not too far down the road , the way technology is going.........
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just love the love story and the suspense and action is great!! Can't wait for the movie to come!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|super fun and makes me laugh. really good gameplay even though a little glitchy at times. enjoy it almost as much as watching the movies,
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|fun book to read however the plot twist was foreeable by a couple of miles and wasn't that jarring or thrilling.
0141038225|5.0|have read bo previous books, so i knew what iwas in for.  the breath and scope of his intellectual is amazing, his command of languages and the meaning behind the specific words equally so.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I installed the kindle for android and although I love to read books, this has become my new way to read. Love the &#34;back light&#34; being a &#34;senior&#34; I need the light and I find my Android holds so many books, I just love that kindle for android lets me have a kindle without having a kindle.
076790592X|5.0|This was a must read in my reading/writing class. This is a very good novel on a student and mentor. And the book I purchased was in great shape and shipped on time as stated it would be by seller.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Great for a book club read. Although this was a novel, the story was well written loved how she tied the two tales together.
1451648537|5.0|I was really enthralled by this book. This volume was a lengthy and worthy life summary of a man that had a great influence in our world. He was recorded as repeatedly stating that his goal was to \\"change the universe\\", and he seems to have done so in many ways. He has changed the way we use computers with contributions to the graphical interface, he largely influenced the way we have access to digital media and apps with iTunes/iTunes U/App Store, and created baseline standards for what we expect from portable devices such as portable media players, phones, and tablets. Steve Jobs had reportedly encouraged the author to go on his own and honestly report what he found from his research and interviews without the totalitarian oversight that he would have probably exerted if he was more involved in the selection of content. Positive and negative aspects of Steve's personality, experiences, and decisions appear to be extremely accurate and diverse. Although he seemed to be largely influenced by spiritual teachings of Zen Buddihsm, meditation, and eastern philosophy, he did not seem to develop the inner peace and calm that is usually expected from those influences when handling others' feelings and positions. He reportedly held that things (ideas, products, efforts, people) were either great or horrible, rarely taking a middle ground. However, the quirks of his overbearing personality and intuition are what seemed to have given him the invaluable ability to motivate and drive himself and his associates to achieve so much. This book is a great read that will likely suck you into his \\"reality distortion field\\" and amaze, inspire, mortify, and astonish most readers.
B0030P1WKY|5.0|Inspiring, spot on, and interesting! Love her books! This one is a gem!!! Her other books are equally as good!
B006OBUKDQ|4.0|Lots of twists and turns.

B008D28HYS|4.0|Love this game! Easy to learn to play, but challenging enough to keep me interested. Only downside is that I'm required to be signed on to the Amazon App Store in order to play.
B00F5FBE82|4.0|I really like the cd, not what I expected but surprisingly good!  There is a lot of singing from Drake on this album, not as much rapping but it cool though.
044022425X|3.0|Drums of Autumn had the potential of getting 5 stars from me, but fell short.  The beginning was good and the end was good but the middle dragged on and on.  It took me almost three months to get through this book.  Not sure how I felt about the characters.  I liked Roger, Lord John, and Ian very much but the others were so annoying at times.  Even Jaime who I always liked.  I also felt there were so many opportunities where a storyline could have been written to invoke more emotions from the reader but left me feeling rather blah about it.  About 200 maybe 300 pages were worth reading the other pages just unnecessary filler.  I probably will try to read the next book in the series, but based on mixed reviews I am not very optimistic.
B004UID2LC|5.0|thanks this application I access very fast my prefered videos on you tube about education, sciences, handcrafting, electronics and lots of interest. I really recomend this to every serious user of youtube videos.
140006922X|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much. Growing up in a very Christian family there were a lot of things that didn't make sense to me even as a child. Zealot cleared up so much. I knew the bible was more or less a history book, written by men, revised by men, but i thought it was impossible to discern between what was likely true and what was written with an agenda.  Reading Zealot was enjoyable and eye opening. I loved it. If you're open minded and someone who always looks for the truth, read this!!
B000QCQ8Y4|2.0|This 11th book started off really good. As the book continues it becomes very slow moving & boring. I see why I read these books so far apart because the books are too slow moving & has very little action for my taste.

B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book is great. I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in mystery books. I will absolutely try to read the whole series.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun!  Don't miss out on this exciting game.  Full of fun challenging, and addicting.  Hard to put down.  Challenge friends too.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Will tell friends about it. Love the grafics ,love the colors, cant stop playing it need more games like this.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Child handles the sex scenes very well, just explicit enough to be hot and entertaining, but not so graphic as the current crop of erotic romance.  But strangely, a military error.  Major Reacher is suddenly wearing black oak leaves.  That would have meant he was promoted to lieutenant colonel--but he wasn't promoted.  Just a minor slip, apparently.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I always loved the original Vapor Trails release and wondered what perpetuated all the complaints about the sound. I thought the sound of the original release was unique to that album.  Now having heard this release I must say that it is clear, robust, and beautiful.  Many of the nuances missed on the original version are now displayed.  I now understand what all the fuss was about in reference to the sound of the original release.  The remixed Vapor Trails sounds like a new album that is crystal clear and clean. Thank you for the remixed version.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|So there isn't a lot of head-smashing and neck-breaking in the early part.  There's still a lot going on.  Reacher's mind is working.  Little bits of foreshadowing are occurring that the reader should note.  Child drops these things into the narrative and later one realizes that one should have paid attention.  It was a clue!  I enjoyed the book greatly.  It was the first Reacher novel I have read, and I chose it specifically BECAUSE of the bad reviews.  If this is his worst, the rest must be great indeed.
B001CB8NQE|5.0|I love having access to this on Amazon Prime.  I can enjoy whenever or wherever I am.  Whenever I have to do the dishes or clean the house or fold the laundry, I can quickly and easily pass the time while I do it with some of my favorite characters in Science Fiction.
0142419400|5.0|After reading so much hype over Anna and the French Kiss on every other book blog, I decided to give Stephanie Perkins' debut novel a read. I admit that all of the love for this novel made me somewhat resistant; I don't know where that attitude comes from, but I seem to think I'm just not going to get what all the hype is about. I'm pleased to report that I was wrong and Anna and the French Kiss was everything others raved about and then some.<br /><br />In this brightly narrated novel, Anna Oliphant is shipped off to boarding school in Paris at the command of her well-to-do famous novelist father. While she is resistant to being uprooted and sent to another country alone, Anna also seems to be pretty open-minded and is fortunate to make new friends immediately. One new friend, Etienne St. Clair, is a gorgeous guy who seems particularly (and platonically) interested in befriending Anna; the only thing wrong with Anna's new crush- he has a girlfriend. This novel follows Anna through her senior year at the School of America in Paris, chronicling her crush on St. Clair and lessons learned about friendship, love and stepping outside of her comfort zone.<br /><br />There are dozens of great things about this novel, but they wouldn't mean anything without the characters that Perkins has crafted. From Anna to St. Clair and everyone in between, each character is flawed but likable with their own personal baggage and personality. I especially loved the angsty Rashmi and how likable she was underneath her abrasive exterior. Because the characters are flawed the reader is better able to relate to them and feel what they are going through, namely Anna. Throughout the book Anna goes through a range of emotions and I felt everything she was feeling (even when I saw something coming) because of how realistic she is written. I really cared for Anna as a character (and missed her when I finished reading).<br /><br />I'm always happy to read a novel that is appropriate for younger readers because I get to imagine how I would have felt reading it at a younger age and it helps me recommend books to age groups that might not be eager readers. For Anna and the French Kiss I wish I would have had this to read early in high school. While at times I was worried the content might get more adult than I feel is appropriate for grades 9-10, it never made the leap and that made me trust Stephanie Perkins as an author so much. The reason I back this book as a great read for early high school is because of the lessons Anna learns throughout; lessons about crushes and love, friendship and trust, but most importantly stepping outside of your comfort zone; a lesson I could have used when I was in high school! Furthermore, instead of being an unrealistic love-at-first-sight story, Anna learns about and befriends St. Clair in a more organic way that should be a lesson to all emotionally-charged teen girls. Because Anna is capable of making smart choices despite being emotionally vulnerable she makes for a positive role model and reinforces the idea that teens are good and smart, despite what society implies.<br /><br />I know I can get on my moral soapbox more often than not when it comes to adolescent and teen content, but that's why I loved this book so much. It was wholesome without beating the reader over the head with preconceived notions of how teen crushes and/or love is supposed to be handled. While being an easy, accessible and enjoyable book to read, Anna and the French Kiss is surprisingly in depth emotionally. I can't wait to read the companion novel, Lola and the Boy Next Door. If it's half as enjoyable as Anna, I will be satisfied!<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're a girl who has ever had a crush on a boy, I highly recommend you read this now! 5/5 stars
1451696191|5.0|I had not heard about the book until I saw the Film, which was brilliant.  Decided I'd like to read the book, and easily finished it over the course of a weekend. Very well done, most books to movies seem to change so many things that the original wonderful things in the book get lost in translation.  This was not the case, I found the film stuck to the book almost entirely. The book is written entirely in Charlie's letters to \\"X\\".  We never find out who he is writing to, if anyone at all, but he does allude at least twice in the book, thru the course of his letters that he is actually mailing this to someone, but the someone is not really important, the book is Charlie's way of expressing to us, the reader the things he is feeling, dealing with, and learning over the course of his freshman year of High School.  The author does a great job of making you feel you are right there, does not make it seem you are reading letters but are right there with Charlie, feeling his joy, his sadness, and also his desire to read and to learn more. I've found myself now wanting to read the books his English teacher Bill gave to Charlie to read. (the ones I have not already yet read.)<br /><br />This is a very good book, from start to finish, for parents, it may have a few \\"F\\" bombs and detailed descriptions of some sexual encounters, that involved some of the people in the book, so be aware of that, that it may not be the best for a young teen to read, but the book as a whole, very good, and really could be any of us, altho not to Charlie's specific experience, but all of us, growing up have felt out of place, the desire and yearning for friendships and the pain of losing something important to us and figuring out how to pick up and move on.<br /><br />Would be nice if we had a sequel to see now, after about 15 yrs since the original book was made, where Charlie is now, and what he is doing with his life.  Somehow, I see him as an English Teacher, passing out these great books to his classes, and finding that one student who really needs a good friend in his life too.is classes, and finding that one student who really needs a good friend in his life too.
0345803485|1.0|I couldn't even finish this book. I know it's very popular, but I could not understand why!? I found the characters to be utterly ridiculous and fake. Maybe that is the way the book was supposed to be considering it's an erotic romance type book.

B003H4I4JU|5.0|I love this book. It started off slow but it picks up and really wraps you in. It's a great series and I would absolutely recommend it.
B004JK61K0|4.0|I am very happy with this application for email.  I had trouble with a different email application prevously.  This one has been working fine since I changed over to it.  I have no complaints about it at all.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|As far as I am aware, there is no other location that broadcast so many different forms for jazz lovers. With choices from smooth, vocal, guitar, bass and on and on. But the best part is the ease to select from one form to another; upbeat in the morning, smooth in the afternoon to mellow in the evening, it is all there. TRY IT!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room was recommended by my sister. So glad she passed along the suggestion.<br /><br />Loved the graphics --- wonderfully rendered images!  Imaginative and challenging puzzles to solve. Very intuitive once some were solved.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game. I finished it in several hours. Definitely worth the time to play. Can't wait for version II coming out soon...I hope!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Header title pretty much says it all. This game is also a good way to spend a few spare moments.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The story reveals the enormity of the hardships this country imposes on its citizens in the name of &#34;national security.&#34; But it also shows how hard it is for those growing up in the repressive culture to adapt to another culture with more freedom, like South Korea and even the U.S.
B00ESY77LO|3.0|Since I had not read  the book, I was genuinely interested in the story.  The movie has not convinced me to read the book.  It was however, fantastically and whimsically produced.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Karl Urban is a much better Dredd than Stallone...I don't much blame Sly's portrayal including a more human element but Dredd is the epitome of faceless raw vigilante justice.  Only in Mega City 1 he is the Law.  You can recall Chris Nolan's Bruce Wayne waxing about symbolism in Batman Begins--- that's why the Dark Knight wears the cowl and that is why Judge Dredd should NEVER take off his helmet.  Karl Urban understands this and although he has bemoaned his headgear in previous films (Eomer in LOTR, Vaako in Riddick) he uses his voice and body language to great effect.<br />Now I have by no means been a regular reader of the Dredd comics but what I have read sporadically over the last 20 years is an indication that it is unmined gold for a film franchise.  This movie is complete in itself and only introduces a few of the major players in the comics-- and only a small theme of block war--leaving much left to be explored in the future.<br />Mega City is truly immense and is as much a character in Dredd as New York is in the Marvel Universe or Gotham City is in The Dark Knight.  Although in this universe the city is full of gratuitous violence and blood/gore, so that turns some casual viewers off.  Nevertheless it is faithful to its source material so I was pleased with this movie and highly recommend it to Scifi fans and anyone who enjoys good popcorn fun.
B00AVF8USS|5.0|This movie is everything you could hope for: visual spectacle, well acted, story beats that deepen and enrich the take throughout.  James Cameron is a genius.
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|Christian Bale plays a slick nigh unstoppable protagonist and Sean Bean does what he does best--play a character with gravitas and die so that the weight falls onto the shoulders of others.  This movie has been compared to The Matrix in theme and tone.  The only thing it lacks is a strong villain
B008K8VDPU|3.0|It would be fun for someone with fast finger dexterity. It might be a place to learn notes. If you were an accomplished musician, you might make some pretty cool music with it.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I liked this game but was short on game play. I wished it was longer for what I paid $2.99. It was fun to play but I've played better games.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really really really really like this app. It is easy to use and very customizeable!!! I especially like that it gives how many hours and minutes until it goes off. I highly recommend getting this app.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|Its a blast i wish i could play this on the ps3 im so happy its free though. And ou dont have to pay for any extras
B00F91H666|2.0|This one left me kind of bored. Which is a terrible thing to say about a big budget zombie apocalypse movie. Something of this scale and subject matter should leave you amazed or disgusted or terrified or all of the above, but all World War Z does is turn the zombie apocalypse into a 'meh' procedural. There are some cool scenes, but they all culminate toward a small dull finale. I've read they underwent massive reshoots, due to problems with the ending, and I think the ending they went with does work in a narrative sense, but honestly I wouldn't have minded a stupid ending if it was epic in scale. Example: &#34;Umm...Zombies don't like the color blue&#34;, then show a massive zombie battle. That way you could leave the theater saying, &#34;That was dumb, but did you see that crazy zombie battle at the end!&#34; That is a much better senario, than what we're left with, which is just 'meh'.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I choose this rating because it was not only easy to use but also the availability of the videos and music. I love the fact that I can download YouTube videos and watch them at a later time. It is a great asset for traveling or just sitting in an waiting area. I would recommend this to any YouTube user.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|I am so glad I have added this movie to my collection.  So exciting.  I do wish they had picked someone who resembled the Kahn of the T.V series.  This one was good but not a nice looking.  I am a Treki from way back.  Thank you again.  Denise
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Really surprised how well this show is done...great update on the classic deductive adventures of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I was bored and wanted something to read for the weekend. It really was terrible. Reread The Grapes Of Wrath just for a cleanse after.
B005LAII80|4.0|brilliant<br />one of the best adaptations of comics, well done action and violence.<br />recommended for any fan of Judge dreed
B003DNN0L2|5.0|Cannot recommend this movie enough.  It is perfect for little kid short attention spans - it's funny, fast moving, cute, and only about 90 minutes long.  For adults, the mixture of humor, depth, sarcasm and yes, cuteness, is intoxicating.  Like life it's not cookie cutter, and doesn't have pat answers, but has wonderful characters that we like anyway despite their flaws - because their virtues so outweigh the flaws.  We watch it again and again and always find new things in the movie to ooh and aah at.  Simply can't recommend this movie highly enough, and hope Wes Anderson soon makes more animated features.
B009JBZH54|5.0|excellent<br />for any fan of the Dark Knight, a collection unprecedented in detail and extras spectacular, totally recommended.not to be missed
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great game but disappointing that you have to wait to regain energy for hours if you want to play free because I never can gather enough crystals to buy energy.
B00C28J2VQ|3.0|regular<br />as G.I.JOE fan, I could not miss it. good deed good characters.<br />ninja action spectacular and powerful vehicles. recommended
B0047747A6|5.0|Michael Jackon has really been a source of inspiration to many people, including myself. On this book you will find many good facts.
B0001Z37HM|3.0|nostalgic.<br />good movie based on a comic book character.<br />Regular action and the appearance of conan was good. expected more.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Slow start. And a bit confusing.  I usually read easy readers and this book isn't easy at first. You have to really think about what your reading to follow but as you continue it becomes easier and more addicting.  I'm excited to start the next one!!
B00EBBQXZ0|5.0|If you are a fan of &#34;Scarface,&#34; this book will answer every question you ever had and every question you never knew you had.  I thoughtful and complex look into the film, source materials, director and other areas ripe for examination, you come away from reading with a desire to re-watch the film.  And when you do, your understanding and appreciation will be deeper.  Stevenson's book is required reading for an Scarface fan and is highly recommended to any film buffs.
B0055S348W|3.0|Works great but why do you need to get permissions to read my text messages and email. Not cool for a wireless printer remote!!!
B000OIZUW6|4.0|I really thought it was well written however, a bit repeatative at times  Ken Follet writes the best books, but at times this was a bit slow. Great story though.
B009WUBERW|2.0|I was pretty bored with this picture. The story was very disjointed and most of the actors, big stars in their own right, had stinky parts centered around Sylvester Stalone. It just did not flow. Some good scenery though.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Awesome!!  It is the Perfect blend of Star Wars and Angry Birds!  I love flying Yoda and playing &#34;the Pork Side!&#34;
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Lots of things to do. Don't HAVE  to spend money to advance throughout this game. Unlike lots of other &quot;free&quot; apps.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Had no idea that Danny from the Shinning would be the major character in this novel.m but, it was a great and welcome surprise.  Enjoy.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Vikings made so big impact on the development of the medieval Europe, that I think it is a time for a new epic movie with a modern graphic and attention to authenticity of details and story line. Can't wait for the next season!
B00DJ80VLS|5.0|After reading a number of these reviews, I decided to summarize them into one fill-in-the-blank review. This review works for any Dream Theater album.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of Dream Theater. My favorite album is [album name]. This album is not as good as that album. The songs are too [heavy/light] and also too [long/short]. There's too much [instrument] and not enough [different instrument]. The band just hasn't been the same since [old band member] left. They were the heart of the band. Labrie sings [too soft, too screamy, too high, too low, too distorted, too clear] on this album. The recent album by [band no one has ever heard of] is way better that this album in every possible way. They should make more albums that sounds exactly like [album name] and just forget being creative.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the continued development of Anna and Christians relationship. I also liked the intrigue added with the danger
B00F91SCXC|5.0|If you like zombies, you'll love this movie!! Awesome movie, I would see it all over again. Lot's of action from the start!!
B008Y212PI|5.0|This game is so addicting!I got this app earlier today and I already finished all the levels!As long as you follow the tutorial instructions and watch the little video you will ace it like I did.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|The 1st couple of chapters starts off and I thought oh no...this is not going to be good.  Then it picked it fast and I couldn't. Put it down !!  I will now read the sequel.  Had me guessing all the way through... Was joe god or bad .  Glad I kept reading
B00DP3IESY|3.0|For a Sci-Fi movie that included Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, I guess I was expecting better.  The visual effects and stunts were great.  The basic story line was pretty good too.  There were aspects where I was lost until I watched it again and watched the deleted scenes and behind the scenes featurettes.<br /><br />The pace was slow in several parts of the movie.  In fact, I had to watch it in two sessions as I fell asleep through the first time I watched it.  And I made it further along than my wife had and she loves Sci-Fi flicks as well.  Yes, we had been tired but a good Sci-Fi would keep us riveted regardless.<br /><br />I would buy it if you love Sci-Fi fans as it is a good story.  If you are on the fence about it though, eh, watch some Warehouse 13.  A nice fun, Sci-Fi channel series that is funny, exciting and takes a new direction every couple of episodes.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved this book! The writing felt genuine and characters were realistic and well written. I will be reading more from this author.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Fun, no crashes. The higher the level the more you will hear me yelling &#34;you cheated&#34; to the computer as the AI manages to eke out a win in the last few moves. I am improving though.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book depicts the devastation that WWII had on nations, families, politics, etc. It is filled with great characters (second generation)from Europe, USA ,and Russia. It has tons of history. It is hard to put this book down once you start reading. First, everyone should read \\"Fall of Giants: Book One of the Century Trilogy\\" to become familiar with all of the first generation characters and the world situation that dealt with WWI and led to WWII.<br />Can't wait for the last of the trilogy to be released!
B00ARW2XJW|5.0|Great tool to find out the temperature in the room you are in. Most just give the outside them - this one gives outside and inside.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Finally done. Too long. Too many back and forth in time. Some areas too slow, some too fast. Glad I'm done.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|You can set it up in Fahrenheit or Celsius...<br />Has beautiful layout and shows you a picture of the weather condition too in addition to details.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I bought this because my wife hadn't seen it and it couldn't be streamed. The shipment was on time the package was in good condition. Playback was perfect. &#34;Stephen King's IT&#34; is something I'm glad to have added to my collection.<br /><br />This is a great film, and by now a classic, and the story is great. Tim Curry is epic and short of knowing it's him one wouldn't guess it. Some of the young actors aren't so great. I've never been much of a fan of Jonathan Brandis (Younger Bill), he kind of overacts, which makes it harder to believe his character, to some extent I felt the same regarding the performance of Richard Thomas (Older Bill) though I think he was playing off the performance that Jonathan was giving. I've seen Richard in other things, and he seems to be better in other cases. To some extent the script contributes to a lack of believability in that Steven King tends to build somewhat stereotypical characters that emphasis stereotypes of their personalities. All in all though, it's a great tail of teamwork and friendship in battling a villain throughout life.
B008XG1X18|1.0|I love Pinterest.<br /><br />I used to love this app. Then, it started crashing every time I used it.<br /><br />Now it won't even launch. Like, not at all. Won't even open. Tried restarting; tried uninstalling and re-purchasing - nothing worked.<br /><br />Honestly, every app has some merit if it works at all. DON'T BUY THIS APP, IT DOES ***NOTHING***
B00BMQTY3U|5.0|Charles is the Man! I purchased this after seeing the documentary on Netflix. I love the heart and soul Charles puts into his music. I am now a Charles Bradley FAN!<br />P.S. Charles you need to buy Tommy a drink!
B00EP0KYDO|4.0|Honestly didn't even pay attention to this one. Then I figured it was Will Smith so I bought it. Going into it figuring it was Jaden Smiths movie with Supporting actor Will Smith. I really liked the movie. So yes it's not your normal Will Smith movie. But its a good Jaden Smith movie.
B003M6WERG|5.0|This series is so hilarious.  The characters are so funny and so relatable. Anyone who watches will absolutely love it!
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|I have watched the first disk a few times now. This show gets better and better with each viewing. Thanks!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really enjoyed this rather gripping fantasy tale. It was well written especially his first person narrative. Very good read.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I saw this in the theatres, and loved every minute of it. I am happy to add it to my collection.
B005544V6A|5.0|Awesome show! Simply glued to it!<br />Can't get enough of Harvey Spector!<br />Hot Hot Hot! Power players in NYC. A must see!
B008HK3XOU|5.0|Came just as described, a little tricky to figure out at first but looks great and does the job of protecting the kindle
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I just wasn't as thrilled with this latest.  It was just sort of 'meh'.  Love your work john, but you've produced better.  I'm still a fan, likely always will be.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|Great game, great graphics and gameplay. Game is challenging and gets harder as you go further in the Levels. I love this game.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|That's all that's got to be said about the quality of this item! Star Trek fans definitely know good entertainment.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a very good book and I enjoyed reading it. This book opened a whole new world to me. I can't wait to read more of his books
B0028RXXFC|5.0|There is no better way to represent one of the most well known moments in history. Let alone all the historical accuracies.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this second book in the series.  Wow!  Where to begin?  So much happened in this book. We learned a lot about Christian in this book.  The part with CT threw me.  I can't wait to see if they get their HEA.
B0053FANS6|4.0|Definitely love the action, all the chases, along with the intellectual tidbits of information from real history. Even the third one
B0091REZMW|5.0|The game keeps you constantly trying to keep ahead. Great game for the money, gives you hours to explore!! Awesome interactions.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|It's a classic. I never tire of watching this movie. The content streamed prefectly with no audio or video problems. Amazon Instant Video is a great service.
B004MPEFBE|5.0|Great movie and great book companion. As in all of this movie series the effects and cinematography are amazing. Can't wait to be able to see it in my Droid too.
B008Y212PI|4.0|These are relatively easy grid type puzzles that you will enjoy if you are a fan of these kinds of puzzles. Nice lay out, easy to catch on to, also would be a good intro to this type. Cross Me and the color version are better, but these are nice too!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I did not like this book as much as his second one. I felt like it was all over the place with the characters. I kept trying to wrap it all together,and seek the symbolism. It wasn't a book I couldn't put down,but I do look forward to his next book.
1476727651|5.0|A wonderful sequel to The Shining that both re-visited a lot of of scenes, emotions and events from The Shining, and took it in a new and entirely different direction.  There is horror, both supernatural and human, but, as with many more recent King novels, there is a lot more about family, relationships, people, and where our choices in life can and do take us.  In this sense, this book is a real departure from The Shining, but a good one.  It explores a lot the themes of family history, how the past can stay with us, that life comes full circle, and how there is a little darkness even in the best person and a little light even in the worst person (also covered in Margaret Atwood's review of the book).  Underlying all of it, is the exploration of the mystery of death and how we all deserve some dignity and comfort when we face it.  The death scenes are probably my favorite, and I love that Danny is once again Doc...a new and wonderful Doc.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Extremely interesting reading. A true pilot and his love of country and other fellow pilots.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I'm only a few episodes in. The story is good so far. I'll continue to watch it and would recommend it for others.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The game is just right. Not to easy and just hard enough. I am waiting for a few more floors.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was sure it was not going to be good - too way out there. I was mistaken! I love the young Captain Kirk and his crew. This is by far my favorite Star Trek movie. If you are a Star Trek fan and have not seen this yet, I highly recommend it!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love this app. It's always great for inspiration and ideas when you need one. I like that it's not just for women
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I'm hooked!  The story lines, while interconnecting, also stand on their own.  Casting I'd have to rate an excellent as well; though I've never been a huge Julie Margulies fan, she's perfect for this role.  Characters are complex, and dialogue is smart without seeming contrived.  Really happy to be watching these without commercials, too!
B00632HWOG|5.0|It is great I love it love it love it. It sends my mail fast and it couldn't be better
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|for this price, it turns my slightly older LCD into a modern &#34;smart&#34; tv.<br /><br />love the netflix and YouTube linking.<br /><br />wish it had more apps, Chrome for Android, Hulu, and my phone's media player... not just play movies.<br />also, there's a bit of load errors with YouTube on LONG video's that you stop mid way through and come back to.
B00C2IGQBA|5.0|Still by far one of my favorite Batman movies! It takes me back to being 7 and seeing it in the theater for the first time! It was so dark for Batman back then.
0061122416|4.0|The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho is an inspiring fictional novel that has a theme that everyone can relate to and apply to their nonfiction life. The story is about a young shepherd, Santiago, who has recurring dreams about finding a treasure at the pyramids in Egypt. After soliciting help from a gypsy who helps to motivate him to follow his dreams he decides to embark on a journey that will undoubtedly change his life.  The Alchemist is a story that is eloquently written and is so relatable and inspirational. The basic premise of The Alchemist is that everyone has a dream or a \\"Personal Legend,\\" it is just up to the person to decide whether they are willing to put in the work in order to achieve it. During Santiago's journey, he meets many characters that help him out along the way. He also endures some hardship as well from coming in contact with a thief, having to put his journey on hold in order to work and learn and grow some more, to leaving his new found love behind, traveling in the middle of a tribal war, and even coming close to being beaten to death. The point is that no matter what Santiago had to endure he still chose to follow his heart and not give up on his dream. If you are planning to embark on a journey of your own or you are starting a new project or if you even have dreams of your own, Santiago's story is definitely one that you should read. I am glad that I have added this inspiring story to my shelf and The Alchemist will probably be a must read for me every year and will be a story that I will be happy to pass along to help motivate others to follow their hearts and achieve their dreams.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I thought it was well played out and the singers did a good job considering that they are actors! Can't wait to watch it again!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|I like the it bcuz it keeps me active and it is a fun game it is not the best game but fun
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app helps me to get ready for school and telling me what to wear on a cold day or hot with a touch of a button or app if you prefer to say that.
B00785P2QC|4.0|A fun game which really hooks you.Every morning when I wake up I check to see how my city is doing.Great game for all those who love the Sims series.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|It's fun, about a 6 on a 1-10 challenge scale. Disappointing on the in app purchase set up, however really entertaining and fun. Definitely recommended for kids.
B004YXE438|5.0|I got this game for my daughter on my kindle. It's brilliant and she loves it. I had a go and its harder than I thought it would be but it's great fun.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|I liked angry birds, until the Space and Star Wars editions came out. Now I love it! GREAT JOB &#34;Rovio&#34;!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|This game is so much fun! I absolutely love it! I'm completely addicted! If you like golf solitaire on pogo.com, you'll love fairway solitaire. Great graphics, great commentary, and the gopher is a great addition! Easy to learn, so great for anyone who knows their way around a deck of cards.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|Its great for figuring out a song title, artist, or just tagging songs i like for download later Also love the lyric play on it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I loved this book because it is essentially a political/religious/economic history of 1st century Palestine interlaced with textual analysis of the New Testament and related documents.  There is so little evidence on who the historical Jesus was that the author infers who he most likely was from the context.  You may or may not believe his interpretation, but the analysis and history is fascinating.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I would love to watch this every night. Regular channel TV is so disgusting. Violent, sexual, foul language. Why won't they learn?
B00BIPKROU|5.0|Such amazing acting. Such a well woven storyline. The Good Wife always delivers on every conceivable level! Cannot wait for season 5!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read some reviews that said this book was pointless and it was a repeat of the first.  I totally disagree.  I think this one is possibly better than the first because it goes beyond the arena to show the rampant corruption and the inhumane treatment in the districts.  It rises to a whole other level.
B00E9P959O|5.0|I always thought \\"Vapor Trails\\" was a strong album, but felt like the music sounded a little congested and overly loud. The remaster solves this problem. It now really sounds like  a Rush record. It's not as busy sonically: the multitracked vocals are downplayed, the guitar is a lot less noisy, and the bass comes through much more now that there's a lot more space in the music. Geddy is no longer fighting his way through the guitar and drums. I even heard a guitar solo in \\"Ceiling Unlimited\\" that I swear wasn't there before.<br /><br />Rush had a good reason for making music that was so amped up after their hiatus. They were no doubt eager to get back into the studio and I always liked the somewhat off the rails sound that \\"Vapor Trails\\" had, but the quieter, more restrained sonic palette is much better.<br /><br />Geddy says that they overcooked this record the first time around, and this has been my complaint with \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" and \\"Clockwork Angels,\\" both of which sound overworked with way too much overdubs. I'd like to see what Bottrill would do with those.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is so well written!  I did things backwards.  I saw the movie when it first came out and just now got around to reading the book but regardless of when I did it was so worth it!  There is so much depth to this story, the characters are multi-dimensional, no fluff here.
B00BEIYMTW|2.0|See title.<br />My son LOVES most of the other Disney movies. All three Toy Stories, the first Cars, the two Monsters, Inc. movies.<br />This one? We tried to see it four times, and all four times, we both were done with it halfway through.<br />Just a blah movie all around.
B00CPTUN5G|4.0|Call me one of the skeptics -- as something of a My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic fan, I had strong reservations regarding the upcoming \\"Equestria Girls\\" movie (though at first I misheard and thought it was going to be its own series, not simply a movie).  Humanized ponies?  That just sat wrong with me, given that I'd grown quite attached to the equine-run world of Equestria and its horse/Pegasus/unicorn inhabitants, and some leaked character designs only further turned me off.  It seemed as if Hasbro wanted to latch on to the same market occupied by Bratz and Monster High, and while I understand Hasbro has to make a buck somehow, the movie seemed like little more than a money-grab to me.  But I was determined to give it a chance before writing it off completely.<br /><br />I saw the movie for the first time this weekend (my sister, a bigger Pony fan than I am, sat me down and made me watch), and I have to take back a lot of what I thought.  While I do still prefer the characters as ponies, \\"Equestria Girls\\" is a fun and cute spinoff, and well worth a look if you're an MLP:FIM fan.<br /><br />WARNING:  This movie does contain some spoilers for the Season 3 finale of the show.  It's recommended that you finish watching the series up to the end of Season 3 before watching this movie.<br /><br />The movie picks up almost immediately after Twilight Sparkle's coronation as a princess, and she's still very unsure about her royal duties and her newly acquired wings.  But when a mysterious intruder steals her crown -- which contains her Element of Harmony, thereby rendering the other Elements useless -- Princess Celestia shows her a gateway to another world where she can face down the thief, a former student of Celestia named Sunset Shimmer, and recover her crown.  Traveling to said other world turns poor Twilight into a teenage girl (and her dragon companion Spike into an adorable puppy), and she finds herself in a strange alternate reality where Canterlot is a high school, familiar faces from Ponyville have become students, faculty, and storekeepers in a human city, and the human versions of her best friends are bitter enemies who hold grudges against each other.  Even worse, Sunset Shimmer is clearly the queen bee of the school, using manipulation and blackmail to further her own ends.  Twilight will have to reunite the human versions of her friends, beat Sunset Shimmer at her own game, and re-obtain her crown... all on a time limit, for the portal to this world will close within days and leave her stranded in the human world if she doesn't hurry...<br /><br />The plot is fairly clich&eacute;, combining elements of an alternate-universe plot (including finding doubles of people from one's own world and operating on a time limit with the threat of being trapped in the alternate reality) and a traditional high-school flick (the school dance, the cliques and popularity fights, the underdog trying to overthrow the most popular student in school).  But it manages to mesh these two normally-overdone plots well, and that helps it stand out from standard fare.  The fact that said plot is carried by familiar faces and characters doesn't hurt either, especially given that one character in particular is still trying to figure out the basics of walking upright and using hands instead of hooves in addition to trying to complete her quest.  In fact, some of the funniest moments come from Twilight's missteps as she has to learn that running on all fours and eating without using your hands are generally seen as bizarre among humans.<br /><br />The animation is as smooth and clean in the film as it is in the show, and despite taking place in our world it fits well with the colorful and inventive world of the show.  The Technicolor look to the humans can be a little off-putting at times, though -- it does help the viewer recognize a particular favorite pony in their human form, but it does make for some head-tiltingly strange moments -- wouldn'ta purple-skinned human be a little strange in the human world?<br /><br />Speaking of recognizing favorite ponies, however, part of the fun of this film was finding favorite ponies from the show amongst the human populace of this world.  Not only are the Mane Six present, but Princess Celestia serves as the principal of the high school (with Princess Luna as vice-principal -- I didn't see Princess Cadence, however).  Cheerilee, the Cutie Mark Crusaders, the Great and Powerful Trixie, Snips and Snails, Mrs. Cake, and Big Macintosh also get appearances and lines, and sharp-eyed viewers might also see minor characters such as Photo Finish, the DJ pony, Featherweight, Time Turner (aka Doctor Hooves), and Derpy Hooves (aka Ditzy Doo) in various scenes.  And the show also introduces a few new characters, such as Sunset Shimmer and Flash Century, who I hope make appearances in the show proper.<br /><br />EDIT:  Forgot to mention -- the songs.  Just like in the show, the songs in this movie are quite catchy and fun.  My two nieces have many of the songs memorized and will sing along with the characters.  Hey Hasbro, release a MLP soundtrack already, will you?  I'll pay for it...<br /><br />While I still prefer to see the ponies as... well, ponies, this show was a fun departure from the norm, and a lot more fun and well-done than I was expecting.  Any fan of the show should give this a watch before dismissing it out of hand.  Who knows?  You might just love it.  And if nothing else, it's fun looking for various favorite ponies in their human forms.le-skinned human be a little strange in the human world?<br /><br />Speaking of recognizing favorite ponies, however, part of the fun of this film was finding favorite ponies from the show amongst the human populace of this world.

B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I can't count on my hands and feet how many times I have listened to this soundtrack in the gym; the car or at home to the point of driving people nuts - but the songs are so easy to sing along with. And even if you're not a fan of music covers, I don't know many people who won't rock out to Journey's 'Don't Stop Believing' or Guns and Roses and 'Paradise City'.<br /><br />My opinion may seem biased as I am already a big Tom Cruise fan but his vocal talents surprised me. I think this will also appeal to fans of the movie the most but either way it's one of my favorite modern musical soundtracks.<br /><br />A side note - I have the DVD release of the film and was surprised to find that the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' sequence was cut out - but it is on the soundtrack :) Enjoy
B00E9P957Q|5.0|Being a Rush fan for my natural born life, and after listening to the remix of Vapor Trail, i am going to say David Bottrill hit a home run on the remix, i disagree with some people who say the remix was made for a lower volume, if you have a good system it sounds amazing, more tighter and crisp compared to the original, my ears arent bleeding on this remix, well done guys, and although the other 6 Cds arent remixed, they still sound different to me for some reason, i recommend all of you Rush fans to go get this...
B00594XOZU|1.0|My KIK is stupid because it will not let me log in to my account. It doesn't let me text and. It is slow
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is a great game kind of like Xena and Hercules jammed into one package! Um kind of sucks to have do things on line and it should have more than three potions at one time. Are there any cheats to this game?
B009FXIICK|5.0|I love this game! I have a hard time putting my Kindle down once I have started playing this game! Love it! : )
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Such a fabulous cast to deliver the lines and tell the story.  I will watch it again in a few weeks.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|The writing was very interesting the way the writer weaves the story of the little girl with the adult woman.  I love the story but was a little disappointed with the ending.  Would have like to have know how their friendship ended.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a story that pulls the reader into the lives of two women who encountered similar situations but during different decades. The characters were well developed and the story line was written so that you the reader knew who's life story you were going to encounter. I really enjoyed this author Christina Baker Kline and look forward to reading her other stories and adding her to my list of must read authors. I would recommend this book to readers who like history, both past and current.
B0089LOG02|4.0|I had never heard of the Orphans Trains so this was a history lesson for me.  The author puts out an interesting storyline to explain the feelings of the children who were victims of the system.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I'm really enjoying this game. They have a really good tutorial to explain how to play, so it is easy to get started if you've never played this type of game before.  The pictures that are created are vibrant and of a great quality.  It's hard to put down.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|The book is sweet and exciting. The pictures take the reader to mystical place, full of the odd and unusual.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|When I first heard Lindsey on Youtube I was in awe. The Crystallize music video is breathtaking and hooked me immediately. I have not regretted my purchase of her album. True, some of her songs have a similar overall sound, almost to where they sound like remixes, but who doesn't want more of a good thing? Still, there are other songs with enough variety to be admired. I will buy from this artist again.
B00EQ0CKRQ|3.0|Fun game, relatively good graphics but gameloft titles always lack a certain....feeling to them. The games feel shallow and boring, and needless to say, I have deleted every single one I've had, not because their bad, but because they've really depressingly......depressing. they fell like they all make the game a complete money pit, and if you don't pay, you have to live with consistent hardship and failure within the game.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not much to really add here. Downton Abbey is arguably one of the best period series to hit the airwaves; here in the U.S. and across the pond. Season 3 doesn't disappoint and brings us even closer to all of the principal characters and introduces us to some new ones. From the stunning Cybil to the ever conforming Mr. Carson to the do-gooder Matthew. Their all here at their best! And while the season(series?) finale episode will leave you trying to make sense of it all, I strongly suggest you watch this awesome story from the very first episode in season 1. Entertainment at it's best and the picture quality through Amazon Prime streaming is excellent. Spend some quality time with the Crawleys. You won't be sorry.
B00EY8B8JG|4.0|I'm a geek. I love the Whedon clan and I love Agent Coulson....I'm a dry humor fan. This has a lot of potential and is fun to watch from a comic geek perspective. It's not GREAT, but it's better than the majority of Duck Dynasty clap trap out there. I'll watch it....note I have to purchase it because we don't have tellie, but I'll gladly support the Whedons, the Marvel dynasty and fun television.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|You love this kid the moment you meet him! Such a sweet book that really shows how important it is too be kind, LOVED IT!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I have enjoyed reading Sherlock Holmes for years.  They are worth reading more than once.  If you've never read them, they are far better than any movies old or recent.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|I saw this movie at the theater. It was so much better watching it at home for the second time. World War Z keeps you on the edge of your seat. I am thinking of purchasing the movie to have at home. I highly recommend this movie.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Just finished the second Jack Reacher book.  Every bit the page turner that the first one was.  There are 19 Jack Reacher books, lists as 18 but there a 16 and 16.5.  Could they all be as good as the first two?
B008Y212PI|5.0|I love these games! The early ones are really easy but it definitely gets harder as you move up to the higher grids.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I was completely unfamiliar with the movie until my oldest son recommended it.  Loved the movie.  Decided to read and found out there are many Jack Reacher books.  The movie is book nine I believe.  The place to start reading is here, book one.  It does not disappoint.
B002C6A6N6|1.0|It's astonishing to me that in this day in age, A&E made a conscience decision to outright discriminate against people who are hard of hearing. This show was originally shown with closed captioning. It's also captioned in syndication. I just can't contemplate why A&E would CHOOSE to be so prejudiced against the hearing impaired and opt out of closed captioning or subtitles. Shameful.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Fast, intriguing read! Thoroughly enjoyable! I was lead to read this book by King's recent book tour stop on the view. He described it in enough, yet vague, detail to interest me. The rest is pure reading enjoyment history.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|I had purchased Documents to Go and had nothing but trouble with it. It would lock up my Android, etc. This free tool has been flawless and does everything I need in an Android office tool.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|&#34;CLASSIC&#34;. One of the best movies ever. Deniro, Pesci, and Liotta at their finest. Director Martin Scorcese is a genius film maker. Most people know this movie but for those who don't it deals with organized crime affiliate Henry Hill working his way up and eventually turning to FBI informant. Based on a true story. It's a must see for anyone who has not seen yet. It's a must see for anyone who has seen 10 times or more. It's an American Classic.
B00CATSONE|3.0|The book is a nice tribute to Tesla, and a short read. It is actually an intro for the reader to look into a longer, purchased book. It was fun to read and I did learn a few things about Tesla.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|romance, adventure, well written and great acting. You can enjoy it all unless you enjoy car crashes or gore. .
B00C3HN1RM|5.0|I absolutely Loved this book, I even bought one for my Sister and one for my Son. I also bought an extra one, just in case the internet goes down and I can't read it again. I know that sounds crazy but I don't want to ever lose access to it. LOL.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Poorly cast, weak script. Great cinematography and choreography, but the actors just did not carry the story, probably because the script was weak. The cast was just not right for the parts.
1452101248|5.0|you say  50 dollars  then no ship fee but thats not true, you break stuff down so lI pay qawuite a bit for lshipping  I think with the pepper stuff my wife wanted it cost as much to ship0 as to buy it !! wow
B00F91G5BS|5.0|I stayed on the edge on my seat the whole time!!! Would love seeing it again...Please see this movie...see it..
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app reloads and updates quickly and is pretty accurate thus accuweather<br />Nice feature on map to switch from radar to cloud cover and back.
B001CDD84Y|3.0|Nothing great. There was a lot of un answered questions left. Like why are they able to teleport. Leaves a Sci-Fi buff wanting more out of it.
B00CTGVKGQ|4.0|Lovely work...don't think the five songs are worth the price, though.  Hopefully, she'll do more work as good as this.
B00EB6ENXO|4.0|Great movie, best iron man out of the three. I knocked off one star just for the lack of bonus features on the dvd. I'm sure the blu-ray has awesome bonus features though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a great game at it. It good. Download it now pleasantly missing out on a lot of fun.
B009YG2ND8|4.0|I'm a big fan of roll playing games. When will FFIV - FF X or more be available?  It is really a nostalgic and fun game to play.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I found this book touching, exciting and very good. It was a fast read almost making you linger on the last chapter not wanting it to end. If you ever devoured a book in a few nights because you just couldn't put it down this is the book to read.
B009Y6231U|4.0|This needs to be filed away in SYFY Classic's. This is a look into the future and what we are capable of as the human race. There is or will be life out there (Mars is the beginning). Always liked this movie!
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|My husband is a real Star Trek fan and he loved this series. It fit the screen too since they are the old shows on TV which I was surprised and even I watched a few of them with him. Arrived in great condition sealed and new.
B003XDXNOQ|2.0|The cushioning of these crocs is less than the standard ones.  I had to remove the top strap because it was much too tight.  That leaves me with shoes that have &#34;button nubs&#34; that stray too far from the shoe.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|The series continues.  Personally think it is time to loose Pete Marino.  Good story but last couple of books seems that the author is getting tired of the story line.  Lots of time spent repeating events from prior books to bring you up to this point.  Still enjoy for the entertainment value.
030758836X|5.0|Your crazy and my crazy fit perfectly together.  I couldn't stand Amy as I got to know her through her diaries, but when we got to really see her, I gained respect for her.  True love prevails.
B003B02O0A|3.0|Good first book. Even though I read it after many other books. The end left something to desire though, too many unanswered  questions. Too many plots left in up in the air. Will these things ever be answered. Sometimes I liked jake, sometimes he reminded me of a sleazy bum lawyer. I still don't know who he is. The book was long and very wordy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book and did not guess the husband's secret.  The women were all very interesting and I didn't want it to end.  I like the way she writes and will buy all of her books.
B00E9P959O|5.0|Secret Touch is the true test to this remix.  This past the test.  I have really enjoyed the remix glad I bought it and have told others the same!
0061692034|3.0|This story is narrated by a 66-year-old teacher in Canada reflecting back on major events in his life that took place in 1960 when he and his twin sister were just 15--namely his mismatched and misguided parents robbing of a bank, and murders later on, topics for discussion announced in the novel's first two sentences.  However, there's little action but much introspection in this novel.  Much of the philosophizing and musing is muddled, and even the dialogue is largely stilted and awkward.  It still held my interest somehow, but it's my first and last Richard Ford novel.  What was the point really, since the twins' personalities as youngsters would lead you to believe that their lives turned out more or less as they would have even without those traumatic events of 1960.
B008Y212PI|4.0|This would have a five star rating if it didn't make you review to get into the bonus round; however, I did enjoy playing the puzzles and feeling a little rush when I finished a hard one. I also got it for the free app, so I can't complain too much :)
B005PK56TA|5.0|well.. ya cant watch everything thats on tv today.. theres too many great shows, and the dvr can only record so much before the memory is full. so unfortunately, AHS was on the backburner. SO glad I decided to give it a shot after all this time. it was still on my mind but figured id have to buy the dvd set or something, that I cant afford (they charge way to much for those things), but to my awesome surprise, I was roaming amazon like I do about once a week or so and saw that it was now available to watch on prime! w00t w00t!! anyways.. loved it. it was like a never-ending horror flick. watched the whole season in two nights. incredible. dont want to spoil it, so if u want to know about it, read another review, but I will tell u this.. if u like ghost/spirit stories, ull love this season. its dead on! ;) enjoy!
B00B7ERH04|4.0|I have no complaints, I like it, and it does the job! It is a great camera to use on the kindle fire!
B008Y212PI|4.0|Makes you think, which is awesome! I tried the more difficult levels, but maybe i have too much on my mind at the moment, i'll get there :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Hello I love minecraft at first It was weird and I died a lot but when I got used to it I was very good but what I'm trying to say is I love it very much and you should try it to.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I wanted an alarm clock app that was simple to set up, had the ability to set multiple alarms, and had a snooze feature. This app is exactly what I was looking for. I am very happy with it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Very addictive game!! A must play game for people with kids. A little slow at the beginning but once you get the hang of it fun game
B008JJM88Q|5.0|I love this game!!!! It is so much fun, I have used it with my friends and they are amazed. I finally stumped once!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. Plot twists, unexpected happenings, real human actions and emotions flesh and blood people will recognise in themselves.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Winter has came, the dragon has awoken, Jofrey needs his face smashed. Watch, read the books. Greatest fantasy series ever. I believe even better than LOTR!!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Then the second (or third) time you can go really slowly and sort of roll King 's phrasing around in your mind to squeeze every ounce of richness out. And you can catch the references that tie this work to so many of his past stories. And you can get scared spitless again and again.  I love a good story. I love interesting phrasing, tempo, color and depth. I love LONG books that hold my attention. And just as with every single past effort by King, I found all that and more in Doctor Sleep. Every bit as exciting and scary as The Shining - and yes, I was one of those who always wondered what ever happened to Danny Torrance. So if you'll excuse me now, I need to start the book all over again, and enjoy long days and pleasant nights having the CRAP scared out of me....
B000FC1LOC|4.0|The writing is clean, the characters are memorable, and the plot is engaging and challenging.  What more could you ask?<br /><br />&#34;My Sister's Keeper&#34; is the first novel I've read by Jodi Picoult but not the first writing I've read by her.  I first learned about her through her excellent essays and opinion pieces scattered all over the spectrum of magazines and the internet.  It captured my attention, yet, it took the recommendation of a friend of mine to pick up one of her novels.  And I am glad I did.<br /><br />If you've ever known sickness, whether it was you or one close to you, this novel will bring those difficult memories flooding back in a quagmire of emotional circulation.  It was difficult at times, but ultimately helped me revisit those days with a fresh perspective.  Prepare for an emotional journey that is sure to challenge and spawn reflection.  Good read.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|Kelly McGonigal is a terrific author.  I am completely excited to make a study and application of her ideas on Willpower.  I have read many books in my life on willpower, getting stuff done, but this book explains the details.<br /><br />What do you do when faced with Chocolate Cake?  What DO you do!<br /><br />Check out her website and particularly her TED talk on her new subject--stress.  She got a standing ovation.<br /><br />Very highly recommended!
B000U0O9FM|5.0|Fight Club.  It took me too long for this to show up on my list and ended up reading in two days.  It's difficult to read a book after you've seen the movie because of the visuals.  I wish I could have read it before so I could have created my own visuals.  But that is not the point.<br /><br />Fight Club is a quick and engaging read that keeps you engrossed from beginning to end.  The writing is sparse yet hard hitting and the main character is developed.  I only wish Marla could have gained a few more dimensions but it wasn't her story.<br /><br />Read it.  Then talk about it.
1416562605|5.0|This novel is perhaps one of the wittiest and most creatively told stories I've ever read. If you're looking for a good read, it's this one.
B004LROUW2|4.0|It is what it is.  It is a journey across time and dimensional space to find love, that ever slippery emotion that entraps us all.  It is beautiful.  It is memorable.  It is moving.  Read.<br /><br />There are moments of mystery and a flavor of magical realism.  The writing was beautiful and nearly flawless except for a few oversights near the end of the third book that suddenly thrust an opinionated yet very shy to speak narrator that decided to add two plus two even though it was already obvious.  But this minor oversight does nothing to hinder the overall impact of the story.
1449433251|5.0|I have every one of the original C&H books, but to have this pristine collection as well is awesome. A true must-have for any C&H fan!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I loved this app before the update. Now it will turn off in the middle of the night. It is hard to set and it keeps shutting itself down when I do get in to set the alrams. I wish I could uninstall the last update.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's okay. But if you've played the first or oz it's like all the same. I never play the game. Sorry
B00CWY76CC|5.0|FUN and challenging.<br />The game is just the right amount of twists to keep it interesting.<br />I wish there was a hint button tho.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book. It was not as cheesy as I thought it would be, which is always good. I think it is a great book that everyone should read when they are young
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Well I wish you could search the word instead of flipping through but all in all its a good thing to have in your back pocket
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I reallt like the set-up of the app. I like how the background shows what the weather is supposed to look like. I just wish you could ignore the non-weather related alerts.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|Each book I read from the series gets more boring for me. It should be exciting and nail biting but it just didn't cut it for me.  This story follows the lives of teenagers who are trying to save the human race, they think they know how to save the world that they can battle any \\"bad guy\\" and win, it gets on my nerves. These characters are annoying and I'm afraid to read the killzone. While it didn't cut it for me. I am sure that there are plenty of people out there who really enjoy it, this series is just not cutting it for me personally.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is good and all it just wish that they would add rail and or train tracks so we can get to places much quicker but I do luv this game
B00594XOZU|4.0|I have tried a few things for talking to my friends on my kindle, but this is overall the BEST app for it.<br />I am non stop on it.<br />It's easy, it's fun, and it's free!<br />You can easily talk to your friends and strangers if you want to without sharing ANY personal information.<br />I love this app, I highly recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is crazy addictive and takes me away from doing what i should. I am now homeless with no job and my wife left me. Pleas come out with a Hill Climb 2!!!
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I agree with a previous review that mentioned the difficulty in keeping straight the many characters introduced early in the book.  The book is worth a little extra effort at the outset as the author goes on and does a fine job in shaping the main characters.  It wasn't all that predictable to me and I thought the twists and turns were fairly credible and fun.  But on and on and on with the hot cross buns?
B002S45V32|3.0|I had thought I watched this movie years ago but turns out I hadn't.  It was an ok movie but not as good as The Breakfast Club or 16 Candles.  Worth watching.
B00E9P959O|5.0|WOW! Immediately after the first seconds of One Little Victory (remixed), I was simply in awe. The remix gives Vapor Trails a new birth. I have always loved these songs. Now I'm just completely blown away. This is the phoenix from the flames.<br /><br />The original had a lot going on but it was all so smashed together, you really couldn't tell what was what or if it was even there. Now you can hear all the cool little parts- everything is mixed and balanced perfectly. And now there are DYNAMICS!<br /><br />Vapor Trails can now stand as the rightful masterpiece it has always deserved to be. Did I mention I LOVE these songs?!! \\"The time is now again!\\"
B008Y212PI|5.0|This is my kind of game. Helps me wind down at the end of a hectic day. Works perfectly on my Kindle HD.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I really tried to give this update a chance but I'm done with it.  Every morning before I get out of bed, I pull up this app. Lately I can't get it to come up at all much less having to wade thru all the junk to see what the temp and forecast will be. This is exactly why I no longer watch the WC on TV. Please just give me the weather!  And what is with those &quot;ACHIEVEMENTS&quot;?  I doubt your demographic is 12 years old.<br /><br />KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid and I'll come back to you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A totally absorbing story, brilliantly written with excellent character development. A little soppy at the end but ----hey that's sometimes what these stories need.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is a great thriller.  Nothing is what it seems.  Outstanding development of the characters' psyche. I can't wait to read other books by G Flynn.
B004YKSXYW|4.0|I would have like it to be a little more detailed on the rest of the world (especially US, China and India).
