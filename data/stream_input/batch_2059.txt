0515142247|5.0|This is a great book and met all of my expectations of a Jack Reacher novel and more. The story was well thought out with twists and turns and the unique moments of jaw-dropping surprise. I highly recommend this book for current Jack Reacher fans and even for those picking up this series for the first time (although you may be a bit lost).
B001DUDKEY|2.0|I have not yet read the book, so I cannot say whether this movie is true to it. I can however, say that though the plot itself seemed to have potential, my attention was not held by this film.<br /><br />The characters were okay, and I was able to sympathize with Anne; but Captain Wentworth did not appeal to me somehow- perhaps it was how he ignores Anne for most of the movie and seems slightly resentful. In so for as the other characters, Mary was very funny (\\"I am so ill...\\") and Charles seemed a decent chap.<br /><br />The only scenes that I really enjoyed were 1) when Anne first comes to Uppercrosse and Mary discusses her \\"Illness\\" and 2) When all Charles' family pour out there troubles on to Anne, and give advice about Mary's children. All the other scenes were unremarkable, and the scene when Wentworth admits that he is still in love with Anne is nearly laughable, what was with the circus being there? It just didn't make sense, and certainly wasn't touching.<br /><br />I was sadly disappointed with this, but plan to read the book and see what it's like; I hope it's better than the movie.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This is a really nice movie.  The voice of George Clooney as Mr. Fox is soothing which makes this movie great for some relaxing quiet time.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Have a few of these in my various kits. Bought this for a friend who needed a compact sharpener for his daily carry knife.
B007STBUIW|5.0|jaws is a cinema clasic. its directed by steven spielberg who is easily one of the all time best directors. eveyone loves this movie. also very quotable. \\"We're gonna need a bigger\\" boat. just great. love jaws
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So far so fun.  I like the addition of riding in the mine car.  The only problem I have had is losing a gem when I try to ressurect and the game shuts off.  All in all a fun game
B00B2FDF54|5.0|Clint Eastwood maintains #1 position in acting and directing in this warm and lovingly done film. I recommend this film whole heartedly to anyone who loves anything baseball.

B003NX76BM|5.0|Am a long time Roberts fan and have read this book 3 times.  I decided I wanted an ebook copy as I will probably read it yet again.  What can I say - A GREAT BOOK!
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Does what it was advertized to do. Great program. Designed with the Kendle Fire in mind and provides good service.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|and i don't think it was supposed to be such a comedy. What an unhealthy relationship, and I don't mean that simply because they do some experimental moves in the bedroom (or other places), but because the dynamic between them was not healthy. The book was corny, the characters were in no way likeable. Ana goes from being a pushover to being super skilled in random tasks, to being a pushover again. She behalves like an insolent child at times then demands to be treated as an equal. And eugh, some of the lines in this book really just made me grimace. It seemed like concepts were just thrown in to move the book along.  it's been a couple months since i finished this book, so I'm sorry to not give specifics, but suffice it to say, bad writing, uninteresting story and I got really tired of the dynamics between the characters.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was a wonderfully written story - I couldn't seem to put it down.  Had a perfect blend of romance, suspense and emotion and I have already recommended this to many of my friends!
B009LXEBD4|2.0|Didn't really care for the majority of this CD and gave it away since I doubt I'd listen to it much.  Guess I prefer the guys in country music better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The story has an intriguing premise and kept my interest.  The end was somewhat disappointing because it seemed unimaginative in comparison to the rest of the novel.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is wonderful read that grabs immediately and holds your attention to the very last page. I highly recommend this book!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I find this book fascinating; a neurosurgeon's account of consciousness when the brain proves to be clinically dead. An Interesting read in which opened my mind to possibilities of what the afterlife can or may be.<br /><br />You feel the authors emotional impact from his experience and his excitement to share that We are all loved. I appreciate the authors insight of what his experience was and will be for him and can be for the rest of mankind.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Had to watch it twice before i finally got all of it.  After watching the<br />second time and understood what was going on I loved it.  Hope the<br />do a sequel to this movie.

B001ILHY1I|5.0|I loved all the action and blow ups this movie has and for once<br />the good guy comes out on top.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app, I am reading again and enjoy the convenience of a huge selection of my favorite type books and the ease of obtaining them when I am ready.  Books are downloaded onto my tablet within minutes.  I also appreciate that many of the books are free.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. It is, in my opinion, way superior to Pandora. There is no login. You can add favorites without have a an account. It's great. The iPad app is very superior over the Kindle or iPhone apps. Which I have them on all of mine. I highly recommend this app.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The sexual activity actually gets boring to read as it takes up too much of the narrative.  However, once again we are left hanging, so I will undoubtedly read book three.
B005LAIGW8|4.0|I don't think it stayed with the charcter of the first movie until the<br />end whe he finally accepted his fate.  But liked otherwise.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I've used Avast on my desktop and laptop computers, and was anxious to try it on my Android smartphone- LOVE it! Not only does it protect against viruses, but has an anti-theft component that I neglected to think about before. Can't think of a single con....
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was my first book I purchased on my Kindle.  I could not put it down...was sneaking my Kindle at work every chance I got.  Great story line,,,didn't see the twist coming until the end.
0345803485|3.0|I will start with this: Granted, the plot-line (basic skeleton of the book)was intriguing.  But I could not agree more with every other comment here.  The heroine is \\"an average brunette, who doesn't think she's pretty, who has too big eyes, clumsy and awkward\\" etc. etc. Is it just me?-or does this describe EVERY female character created in the past decade (cough cough Twilight).  She as a character is typical.  Her logic was hard to follow as a person.<br /><br />Also, I feel as if the author had a thesaurus glued to her hand the entire time she wrote this.  I understand looking for synonyms every now and then.  But when you have one, very noticeable word used multiple times in one page, nay one paragraph it is down right irritating.  And with the repetition of themes, for lack of a better word.  She blushes, bites her lip, and rolls her eyes.  He mentions biting her lip, and \\"doing it\\" in an elevator\\", and \\"everything below the belt\\" and her gazing into his gaze, as he gazed at her...non stop.  Awful.<br /><br />I was under the impression that this was huge erotically charged book about an S&M relationship...she gets actually tied up, or participates in true BDSM activities what?-once? maybe twice in the entire book?  The sex was just way too much, as well.  It got to a point that I was skipping almost entire chapters just to get back to them out of the bedroom.  Nobody!!! has that much sex.  It averaged in the book like 20 times a day.  Really?  Virgin to 24/7? And in the course of a week?  A week in which, I might add, she more or less falls in love with this psycho, moves in with him, drops her own life, and decides she can't live with out him after this amazing 7 day period.  It may as well have been called \\"Twilight: Minus the Vampires\\".<br /><br />Overall, horrible redundant, poorly written, and so unrealistic.  Does not live up to it's hype...at all.<br />(Worst part is, I have to listen to women gush over this book all day at work :( . )
B000OVLBEO|4.0|loved the good over comes the bad and nicholas cage did a great<br />job of the ghost rider.  glad that i bought it.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|For the brief time I had it installed it was, by far, the best, most &#34;desktop-like&#34; FB app, but ultimately an app that hogs memory and prevents you from accomplishing anything is of no use. If all you do is facebook from your phone, go for it, but if you want to have any kind of utility or app beside this running, save yourself the trouble,
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Whether you are an avid birder or not, you will enjoy this movie.  It is free of sex, foul language, and any kind of obscenity, so it's great for family watching.  It's a light-hearted comedy so don't look for any depth of character or any moral takeaways.  But, for good family-friendly and light entertainment - it's perfect.  This movie made me an even bigger fan of Jack Black, Owen Wilson and Steve Martin.  Whenever I need to get my mind off of serious, unpleasant matters, I drop this DVD into my player and lay back for a couple of hours because it's mindless in a very good way.  It also inspired me to the art and science of birding.  I now have a much greater appreciation for the skill and knowledge it takes to be a great birder - for which America has a few -- whose books are worth discovering also, so check out your local book store.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is the best series since 24!  It keeps you guessing and the acting is superb.  Can't wait to view the next season.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I saw this in the top list and was curious. been hooked eversince.  Especially when u see you fb friends. Your challenged even more with the urge to top there score
B000FL7CAK|3.0|I give it a 3/5 just because of the fact that the show is good. I have had the 1st season for a long time and I am just now getting this second season. I watched this when i was younger so It is a good continuation from the 1st season. 1st season is best in my opinion so far.<br /><br />The bad:<br />What's up with the horrible packaging of the discs? Maybe its because this is a old show and packaged back then, but it is from my experience that have the discs on top of each other like that isn't the brightest and most consumer friendly way of holding the discs. 2 of the discs will not even stay in place! They keep falling out. Thank goodness that there is an outside box  that you slide off because the discs would just fall right out when I pick the product up. Its also silly having to take a disc to be able to put one behind it.<br /><br />Good season, bad packaging. 3/5
B000002NZO|4.0|With this album, Genesis entered the prog rock realm. The band here is still searching its own sound, and a remarkable quality on this album is the profusion of pastoral elements due to Anthony Phillips, from the first band lineup. Some guitar sections seem to depict a quiet British countryside used as a background for more vigorous musical action. Favorite track? \\"Looking for someone\\". Its opening verse actually made me fall in love with Peter Gabriel's voice, although it uncovered its full potential in later albums. It is good having this album. Curiously, I have started from \\"A trick of the tail\\" (which is close to the end of Genesis' authentically prog period) and worked my way back to the beginnings.
B001IZID3W|5.0|this album is amazing and sounds so much better on vinyl than on a regular cd truly is a work of art
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I USUALLY ENJOY READING BOOKS ON THIS SUBJECT BUT FELT THAT THE DOCTOR USED MORE MEDICAL AND TECHNICAL TERMS AND SO TO THE AVERAGE READER LIKE MYSELF, IT WAS BORING IN PLACES.<br /><br />IT WAS INTERESTING IN THAT HIS EXPERIENCE WAS DIFFERENT THAN I HAD READ BEFORE.
B000099T2L|5.0|I have been listening to Beyonce since she was in destiny's child. The crazy thing is that I have never bought one of her cds. I heard of &#34;crazy in love&#34; and loved the song &#34;baby boy,&#34; but some of these songs I heard of and never knew they were on this album. This is a great album. She has a nice mixture of dance/pop, love, and family (a nice song about her father) I was pleasantly surprised about the Luther Vandross guest appearance. I am very satisfied with this album and I didn't expect to love it like this.
B0055OMBIU|3.0|This is a gift for my 10 year old son and I would rate it as LOVE it and give it 5 stars if it wasn't missing a piece from the manufacturer!  I don't know what we are going to do about that but disappointing for sure when building a 1000+ piece structure.  The missing piece is in a VERY noticable spot of course...
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Another high standard novel by Ken Follett. He really allows me to envision th eperiod. I am looking forward to Book 3
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I am very unhappy it looked better in the picture it don't even stand up like it shows at least mine don't

B00APUYWYA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I thought it would be a Glee movie. This movie surpasses Glee. The cast is really talented. Anna Kendrick blew me away. A definitely must see!!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|All of the songs in the album are awesome. They combined all of the greatest songs into one album. Worth buying it.
B00006674X|5.0|bought for my daughter she is a really big fan of his movies. me personnally never cared for his acting.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This Angry Birds is the best yet!  I have all of the Angy Birds that are out and this one is the best so far.

B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book had me laugh, cry, wish dream and WANT!! I loved Will and Lake.. and there little brothers and omg the poetry!!! Geez I need some slam in my life pronto. The writing was amazing and MS. HOOVER DID IT AGAIN!!  Now on to part two
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The book caught me by complete surprise!!  I was unable to put it down!!  Amazing!!  A definite must have book!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This classic is always great but this one stretches out longer and oh so wonderful....As you know the movie is great but never enough.  I do not usually watch a movie or series more than once except only two and this one is one of them.  I have no idea over the years how many times I have seen this movie.  Infact this was the movie that got me hooked in this era with almost every movie and series and a whole lot of books. Never enough of this kind of series.  I know you will also enjoy this even if this era is not your top 10.  Check it out as this is what really went on. So relive and enjoy and really appreciate the modern things we have today but the romance of yesterday.
1427210241|5.0|Best series ever written!  If you like fantasy style books you need to get this series!  Too bad Robert himself wasn't able to finish it.  But Brandon did an outstanding job!
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|Hands down most twisted and surprising show on tv. This show is one of my favorites and can't wait to hear what the next season is based around.
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites, and I'm a guy. It's absolutely amazing. And of course the product itself was in perfect condition.
B001JU4S44|4.0|Lots of action and never a dull moment, but the use of masks seems to be overdone although it makes the twists in the plot interesting!
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|I purchased this CD after watching the movie and listen to this soundtrack just about everyday... all of the songs are good, a mixture of styles with an old western feel!
B001J3U22S|5.0|Story does a good job of picking up from previous story. The book does a good job of setting up the end of Men or Machines. Lots of human weaknesses along with human determination.
B0000060NH|5.0|This CD is the greatest back in the day type sound that is so alluring.  I think Marvin was an outstanding person in this world, who was put here to make us enjoy CD's like this!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|This was purchased for my kids and they really enjoyed watching it.  They liked it so much that one of them wanted her bow and arrow and the other one wanted her dress.
0060557818|5.0|Neil Gaiman is at the tip top of his storytelling game.  A must read for lovers of fantasy, fairy tales, with a gritty urban element that still manages to retain its whimsy.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|This is an app that downloads the bible based on what you request. Not pleased. The app is on my phone, but I don't like to be connected unless I am downloading something. So it does not work unless connected. Not for me.

1481251880|1.0|There are so many problems with this book- how to begin this review? To say &#34;Hopeless sucks *ss&#34; might be most appropriate, considering the number of times that phrase is repeated in the first few chapters. Examples: &#34;cafeteria food sucks *ss&#34;, &#34;your spaghetti sucks *ss&#34;, and &#34;school sucked *ss.&#34; Really?<br /><br />As the story progresses, the reader is pummeled with superlatives. (In case you didn't pay attention in English 101 a superlative is &#34;the highest degree of comparison, excessive or exaggerated&#34;). On pages 60-61 alone we find: completely out of breath, complete silence, entire way, no one ever, totally fall for it, he has no idea, I've never run, it's taking everything...need I continue? A few pages later we come across &#34;absolutely, positively hate.&#34; There are so many adverbs they totally, completely, and absolutely distract from the story.<br /><br />Minimal text is dedicated to the development of the characters. The names are ridiculous- Sky, Six, Breckin, and Holder? *eyes roll*. Sky's best friend's name was originally Seven, but she changed it to Six just to be uncooperative. The characters are cliched, but at least Hoover got to check all the politically correct and tolerant boxes. Breckin is gay, paints his nails black, and wears pink. That's the extent of his character development. Oh, and the fact that he uses the word &#34;Mormon&#34; as a euphemism for gay. What? I guess it's supposed to be clever. Sky's mother is another caricature- a vegan who eschews technology in any form (at least that figures into the plot later).<br /><br />I understand that the language is supposed to be representative of a typical teenager, but it just doesn't work. It sounds more like a roomful of 12 year old boys trying to outdo one another with profanity and tough talk. Other examples of stupidity include &#34;cop a feel&#34;, &#34;I kicked his drunk *ss out&#34;, &#34;I'll cut a b*tch&#34;, and probably the most ridiculous- &#34;milk that tastes like *ss&#34;. Does anyone talk like this? A small part of the romance writing has potential. It would be nice, girls, if there were a boy out there who would be so obsessed with you- just you- but there's not. However, most of the romantic writing is just insipid. When a couple kisses, one of them says, &#34;It's game on.&#34; On page 170 Sky says, &#34;It feels like the entire earth has shifted off its axis, and Holder is the core&#34; and Holder &#34;crashes his lips to mine&#34; (crashes? perhaps the intended word was crushes?) and &#34;We have just wholly fallen into each other.&#34; I can see why the FEELINGS in the book would appeal to many teenage girls- and I suppose that accounts for the many 5 star reviews. Stirring raging hormones should not be an acceptable substitute for quality writing.<br /><br />Hoover needed help with forming the past participle of &#34;run.&#34; Examples: &#34;He's already ran 4 miles&#34; (p. 78), &#34;I've ran no less than 4 miles&#34; (p. 137), and &#34;faster than I've ever ran&#34; (p. 195). A similar past participle problem appeared on page 234 with &#34;We wouldn't have came here together today.&#34; How does an editor miss glaring grammar gaffes like these? Writing must be clear and correct so that it does not interfere with the story.<br /><br />Finally, who is the intended audience for this book? The language is juvenile, but the subject matter is not. The problem resolution (which I won't go into to avoid spoilers) was rapid, unrealistic and again, just stupid. I'm tired of thinking about this book, much less writing about it. There are finer books waiting to be read. The idea of a Holder (minus his obvious faults) to cherish you is appealing, girls, but his presentation in this poorly written piece of pulp fiction is not worth your time.ous- &#34;milk that tastes like *ss&#34;.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|love the show - have trouble with it &#34;streaming&#34; and the words catching up with the sound, but using an older computer might be the problem.  Other then that, I love that I can watch it on my computer!

1613821670|5.0|If you've never read this, it is by far my favorite of the classics. The creature is so beautifully written, you fall in love with him passionately, and as he falls into his darkness you weep for him. Doctor Frankenstein is at first cold and takes for granted his whole world until the Creature takes it from him and he learns to truly love. The writing is so poignant, the vocabulary so intricate that it will have you grabbing a dictionary and a tissue box. If you are having issues with getting into the book, skip the first five chapters, they were never meant to be there in the first place, Mary Shelley added them later in submission to fashions in writing of the time.<br /><br />This book will haunt you for many years after reading it. The creature staying in your mind keeping your eyes open to the miraculous beauty of the world around you.

B0059XTU22|4.0|Being my favorite book I had to see this in theatres, and I finally have. It's an awesome film, to say the least. It's nice to be back in Middle Earth after a long reprieve. My only complaint is that these films wouldv'e been perfect as two parts instead of a trilogy. It did drag a bit but only a few parts. One good thing about this being a trilogy though, their covering extra things the book didn't quite go into explanation on, so that's a definite plus. It was nice to finally see Radagast on screen too, always been curious about him. Looking forward to the other films though, because I feel they'll be alot better. The book just keeps getting better, so I don't see why not.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app crashes CONSTANTLY. I have been browsing and will randomly be presented with a pop up stating &#34;Facebook has stopped.&#34; I have re downloaded the app several times now and am still plagued by continuous crashes and refusal to load content at all.

The item itself doesn't fully explain all the backstories of characters, so beware to those who are wondering what happens to link after majora's mask and other games. But still great nonetheless.

B0050SYS5A|5.0|The Nyko Zoom for Kinect abrogrates many of the Kinect's worst problems. Install was a snap (literally). Kinect games are now more fun to play. The product is so successful, Microsoft should have built a Zoom lens option into the original Kinect unit.<br /><br />Pity my poor children. The current form of motion gaming requires players to stand within a small 2 foot by 2 foot box. Stray too far forward and you become an undetectable blur. Stray too far back and you bump into the couch. The motion controlled menus are an exercise in anger management, and worse, kid sized hands appear to be too small for the Kinect sensor to recognize. And then the Kinect sensor's web support page explains the 40 inch height minimum to play connect. Take that, 4 year olds!<br /><br />How many households keep their couch more than 8 feet from their TVs? When I was shopping for an HDTV, I referenced a chart showing the best viewing distances for each size of HDTV. Now, if you have a 60 inch or larger HDTV, then you probably want to situate your couch more than 8 feet from the screen. If you have a 46 inch HDTV (which is the median size for an HDTV at this time), you probably want to situate your couch about 6 feet from the screen. Then, of course, there is the issue of the average living room size. In small houses, an average living room is as small as 12 x 12. If the audio/video cabinet sticks out about two feet and the couch sticks out another 3 feet, you have only a maximum of seven feet of distance between the Kinect sensor and you.<br /><br />My house faces both the best viewing distance from the HDTV issue and the room size issue. Our rectangular living room has enough space for us to re-orient our TV and our couch (and pretty much everything else) solely to accommodate the Kinect sensor. The re-orienting your entire space solution has a serious drawback: you either loose the best viewing distance to your HDTV or you have to buy a much larger HDTV. To many, this is a great solution. Who doesn't want a larger TV? But then again, spending an extra $1000 for Kinect gaming seems excessive. For that kind of money, I could send my kids to the local gymnastics place to keep them physically active. Re-orienting our living room and buying a new HDTV is not to solution for my family.<br /><br />The Nyko Zoom solves the room size and viewing distance problem by tricking the Kinect sensor into believing your living room is larger than it really is. Rather than a zoom lens, the Nyko Zoom has a wide angle lens. Objects close to the Kinect with the Nyko Zoom looked appropriately curved. FYI, TV shows also use wide angle lenses. This makes everyone look wider (the proverbial 10 pounds you put on when on television) and makes the sets look bigger. (If you ever tour a TV set, you will immediately notice how tiny they really are). The Nyko Zoom makes your living room look bigger. For us, games like Kinect Sports detected us in the \\"best\\" zone rather than the \\"good\\" zone. Two player games are now playable, as the wide angle lens gives players a wider space to play in. No more 2 foot by 2 foot box for my kids. Considering all the frustration and crying (yes, my kids shed real tears over how awful the Kinect can be) the Nyko Zoom lens should have come standard with the Kinect. (I gave the Kinect a low score because of how badly it works with real kids in real living rooms). My advice: if you have a Kinect, buy a Nyko Zoom lens, and if you are thinking of buying a connect, buy it with the Nyko Zoom lens.. Who doesn't want a larger TV?

B000ZJTPLG|5.0|As I struggle to learn electric guitar, I find it MUCH more convenient to listen over headphones so I don't disturb others in the house. This VOX device works perfectly. It fits into the angled cable plug of the Stratocaster, the my headphones plug into it. 2AAA batteries power it (they have lasted 2 weeks so far) and I get very good sound out of it. A Gain control lets you add distortion. The headphone cord gets in the way once in a while, and that's not VOX's fault, but one improvement would be a bluetooth version that would let me use my Motorola HD15 headphones. I highly recommend this product.

1400067820|1.0|This book has been such a disappointment...<br /><br />It started absolutely great and has an idea (antifragility) that is worthy and notable and interesting. Wait, let me back up from the beginning: I could not finish this book.<br /><br />When I read non fiction I tend to stick to certain rules:<br /><br />1) I want to learn from the books I read. I tend not to read Mathematics, for example, except in formal context, since normally when I read Math being exposed to the general public I noticed how poorly they are really explaining the concepts.<br /><br />2) I don't read books if I agree with the conclusion. For example, since I am an atheist, I seldom read books on the subject of why we should be atheists, I enjoy the rest of Richard Dawkins works.<br /><br />3) I refused to be bored. Despite the previous points I do not read books on astrology, for example, because I am certain they will not convince me of their truth (I won't learn from them), but even more certain I will find them utterly and completely boring.<br /><br />This book started as an amazing jewel. A book where I was reaching for the, thankfully virtual, dictionary almost in every page. When I read the page, almost at the beginning of the book, that said:<br /><br />\\"Now we aim--after some work--to connect in the reader's mind, with a single thread, elements seemingly far apart, such as Cato the Elder, Nietzsche, Thales of Miletus, the potency of the system of city-states, the sustainability of artisans, the process of discovery, the onesidedness of opacity, financial derivatives, antibiotic resistance, bottom-up systems, Socrates' invitation to overrationalize, how to lecture birds, obsessive love, Darwinian evolution, the mathematical concept of Jensen's inequality, optionality and option theory, the idea of ancestral heuristics, the works of Joseph de Maistre and Edmund Burke, Wittgenstein's antirationalism, the fraudulent theories of the economics establishment, tinkering and bricolage, terrorism exacerbated by death of its members, an apologia for artisanal societies, the ethical flaws of the middle class, Paleo-style workouts (and nutrition), the idea of medical iatrogenics, the glorious notion of the magnificent (megalopsychon), my obsession with the idea of convexity (and my phobia of concavity), the late-2000s banking and economic crisis, the misunderstanding of redundancy, the difference between tourist and flâneur, etc. All in one single--and, I am certain, simple--thread.\\"<br /><br />I thought I was in for the biggest treat in reading since Wittgenstein.<br /><br />Alas, though the book starts in a wonderful way and the idea of antifragility is an amazing idea, at some point you realize something is happening. At first, the author criticizes pseudo scientificism, then stars swearing for Baal. That is followed by an exposition of the trivial truth that there are options outside finance that are poorly priced, as if that was a hidden, previously unknown idea. And finally, around the middle of the book, he dismisses science all together. He claims, and, unfortunately, fails to prove, that science does not produce most of the technological (and others? Not clear) innovations through history. He does this through the simple method of claiming we got it backwards, then claiming that in some cases some people claim we got it backwards, then admitting that there may be a few cases where we got it right, but that those are not important. All this starts with some academicians giving birds lectures on how to fly... Before you continue reading this review, may I remind you again that I could not finish this book? It became boring. Furthermore, if you agree with the author, I should point out that I am, of course, a sworn enemy of what he exposes, having a PhD in mathematics and all. Never lectured birds though, just taught some calculus and functional analysis to non flying human beings.<br /><br />Case in point. He claims Euclid results aren't used in Architecture. Then admits that the Pythagorean Theorem is used somewhat in architecture. Who has claim Euclid was central to architecture is not clear... But this represents an ignorance of what Euclid did. He was formalizing previous knowledge. This knowledge was not all original, though some was. To say that people knew some of the things Euclid did before he wrote his books, through trial and error is trivial. Before Pythagoras, the Chinese and the Babylonians knew examples of Pythagorean Triangles, the Chinese may even have known the theorem. What we appreciate from Pythagoras is the proof, which Euclid wrote, not claiming it was being written for the first time. To claim that the pythagorean theorem or trigonometry wasn't used in architecture or engineering before the renaissance is just mere blindness. Go ahead, attempt to build a tunnel or measure a distance or calculating how many stones you need for that door, without anything in the books of Euclid. I'll wait. Yes, people didn't cite or knew Euclid, but they were using the results, not referencing scientific literature.<br /><br />To say that academic research is not based on trial and error is not just a mistake. but not having and inkling of what is involved in any type of academic research, at least in the hard sciences. Academic research, even in mathematics, consist of nothing but trial and error! Yes, afterwards we write the papers as if we knew everything all along, but that is not the practice of science, but its result.<br /><br />To then say that academic research has not contributed to innovations in technology and to try to claim that \\"drop outs' have innovated more is confusing the business of technology with technology itself, is ignoring what cryptography is, and how it developed, is ignoring the irony of the applicability of Hardy's mathematical results, is ignoring the history of the World Wide Web, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, NASA, HP, and a million others. It's, simply, claiming as true what you wanted to be true, without examining it honestly. To use the internet as an example of academic research not contributing in technology is to deny a reality that I lived.<br /><br />At the end, this book is dishonest and boring. Yes, it may have something to be learned from it, but it is an injustice to try to pass crummy thinking as if it was part of a great idea.tecture.

B009FB3WQ4|5.0|This is a wonderful and heartfelt tribute to the world's greatest singer, actress, director, producer, writer and humanitarian. Highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I found it to be an easy read, but it still kept me interested and guessing at the ending.
B004LROUNG|3.0|I was looking forward to reading a John grisham book like his early work, and there are some similarities, like his hero David Zinc.  He is a young lawyer wanting make a difference.  By the final few chapters he does.  In the meantime the characters he works with are not appealing, so it was difficult to keep reading. I really didn't care what happened.
B000L53D4O|5.0|Este juguete llego en muy buena condiciones y a tiempo, era justo lo que mi hijo necesitaba para aprender a dar sus primeros pasos. Los recomiendo ampliamente.<br />Saludos desde Venezuela!!
B008HT4FUW|4.0|This is a fabulous period piece with compelling characters and an interesting plot, highly recommend this for anyone.  However, I am disappointed in the production quality of the blu-ray dvds, at least the ones I received.  There seems to be a problem with frames skipping, so the video at times lurches.  I find it distracting, though others don't seem to notice it as much as I do.  At first, I thought I had a problem with my Panasonic player, but other blu-ray DVD's do not exhibit any issues.  Also, the audio is nothing special, and it does not skip.  I have a 7.1 high-end sound system, and some soundtracks on other DVDs are amazing, but in this case, somewhat ordinary.<br /><br />Hence, this is more of a technology issue than content - as previously stated, this is a fantastic piece of work!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Very funny movie! Definitely not for kids! I would watch this again but I think it was a little over hyped. People told me it was hilarious. It is funny but I've seen funnier. Still a good watch.
B005NJU8PA|1.0|I recharged my new Kindle. When I got done, there was a page advertising The 4-Hour Chef. I did not want to buy it. I tried to delete it. I must of pressed the wrong button. You guys downloaded the book on my Kindle and took the money fr my gift card. I sent an E-mail to Amazon. The problem did not get solved as I am not smart enough to understand your double talk. I will never read this book. I don`t know how to unload it off my Kindle. I am real upset with Amazon. You people played a dirty trick on me and won`t resolve it. I hope that I am able to use the rest of my gift card on some thing other than books. Right now, I will never buy another fr Amazon. You people are terrible.<br /><br />James L. Reamer
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Loved every word! This is a Fantastic book. Really Looking forward to reading the third book. Will be downloading it as soon as this review says I have put enough words.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was a little harder for me to get into. The first part of the book makes a lot of introduction of characters, but the author did a very good job of bringing it together. The way he takes two characters very different from each other and on different paths and makes those paths cross and come together was very fun to read. It is graphic in a few parts for my taste, but a GREAT book all the same.
0684824906|5.0|Considering the subject it was an easy read. And history that most people do not know.well rounded study of people involved
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great app does all pdf files I download for repair and manuals. Wish we cold get the Adobe flash player to work like Adobe reader!
B009A3NGF4|4.0|I was really surprised by this new album. I really enjoyed Sigh No More, but I was not really expecting much out of Babel. Babel was quite a surprise. Though this album might have a cleaner, pop approach, M&S haven't lost any foot stomping power. Overall, it's a good album and worth the buy. I recommend it to anyone who liked their first album.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L is so much fun to read! She's great at what she does and she doesn't disappoint in my opinion. Ana and Christian's story continues thank goodness! They come closer together and the I love that the story morphs into something that goes deeper than an erotic encounters. The ending is so cute, but there's always something or someone I should say lurking around the corner.
B0089XH38M|4.0|I had tried another antivirus product, but couldn't get it to work...it would &#34;freeze&#34; during a scan and then stop working. This product  scans quickly.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of his best. Couldn't put it down! I've never read a book so fast before in my life, a real page turner.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I wasn't a fan of the beginning of this book at first, but it grew on me. E L sums it up and gives us details at the same time (I know that sounds odd). I love that there's hearts and flowers in this book! Love that she gave us a final chapter that was worth the wait to read! I would be interested to read more for 'Shades of Christian', but I understand that she has other ideas and I can't wait to read them!!
B004ZUCR0M|5.0|the only thing i would have wanted to know before i bought it would be....does this come with any digital downloads and extra scenes.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The greatest book ever written. I take it with me where ever I go. It makes it so easy to stay connected.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love the intro to these characters! E L does an amazing job of bringing these characters chemistry ALIVE!! She's an author I would love to hear more from!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I want my very own Mr. GREY!!!!!! ANOTHER brilliant book of passion, love, mind blowing ecstasy.<br />I want more please!!!!
B0000DFZZC|5.0|I bought this while reading Seabiscuit. The movie was good and there were lots of extras with the set. The price for this was really good.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Great music and a great singer. I'm 65 and I rock 'n roll in my car while playing it! Highly recommended.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|I really enjoyed playing the game. I always enjoyed it on my desktop, now I can take it to go, and its hard to stop playing!
B001D52XO2|5.0|Great set. Should appeal to everyone. Nina Simone was known for jazz however she did blues, gospel,pop, and protest songs.  All excellent.  The DVD was a nice and informative addition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is a great story (series), well written, solid story line and engagingly suspenseful. Highly recommended. I read through this series and the Shift within about 5 days. I am anxiously waiting for Dust - the final (??) chapter.
B000KI6286|5.0|Aaron Eckhart does a great job as a lobbyist. A clever comedy that leaves you to think for yourself and not follow the herd.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I FARTED AND IT SMELLS SO BAD THAT I LOVED THIS GAME, MUCH BETTER THAN THE FIRST TEMPLE RUN!! LOVE LOVE LOOOOVE IT!!!! TRYING TO HIT 3MIL BEFORE ALL YOU OTHER FAT RATS OUT THERE!!!!
B000TGJ7ZY|5.0|I love Bram Stoker's Dracula. The art direction in this movie is brilliant. They do take some liberties with the plot but it's very close to the book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Excellent end to the series. It was such a good read. This book brings a close to the series that is believable.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This show is addictive, my sister watched it told me to then I watched it and told my wife too adn I ended up buying to for my wifes birthday because she loved it so much.
0765325950|3.0|Spoiler Alert!!!!<br />After 23 years the story finally comes to a close.  I can't help be feel a little disappointed at how it is accomplished.  I almost wish the last book had been in 3 volumes instead of two.  I was enthralled through Memory of Light, right up until the last 30 or so pages.  It seems that Mr. Sanderson just ran out of pages and closed the story as simply as possible.  So many main characters are left hanging with no closure. Those characters that we were given closure on were done with so few words that it was simply frustrating.  Over 10,000 pages of developing characters and their entire stories are closed in a few brief paragraphs.  And the last pages seem straight out of a cheap western novel.  The hero rides off into the sunset, alone, with nowhere in particular to go.  Yeah, right...  How disappointing.  Maybe he shouldn't have killed off the horse.  Maybe if Rand had stepped out of his tent to find Bela waiting...  then as he stops atop the rise to light his pipe and look back, Tam recognizes the horse and his jaw drops, as he realizes he didn't really just roach his sons body on the pyre. Oh well... I was looking forward to re-reading the series from start to finish, but knowing how disappointingly it ends, I will likely pack the books away and forget about them.
B005LAIISA|5.0|I was very pleased with my product. I also recieved my product befor the the time it was to come.
B00999DFP0|5.0|I love this show and getting the bundle was great so that I could see every episode instead of having to jump around in whatever order they rerun on tv.

1616550414|5.0|I have been playing Legend of Zelda games my entire life, and had extremely high expectations for this book. Without a doubt, this book surpassed my expectations. The artwork is stunning, and the book is of incredible print quality for only being $20. As for the content, I loved all the concept sketches from the earlier Zelda games, and I really enjoyed the history of Hyrule (basically the timeline) of how the games connect. My only disappointment in content was that the book seemed to focus more on Skyward Sword than any of the other games. This isn't a terrible thing, but I did expect this to give more of the development history for each of the games. If you are a Legend of Zelda fan, you simply must own this book. It is a wonderful tribute to the 25 year history of one of the best game series ever.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I don't know why people hate on Kristen Stewart and this movie.  I liked it.  It was a very different take on a classic tale.  The clothing and such were amazing!
B008K6HN8I|1.0|As with so many other applications (e.g. Mozy), this is not available outside the US, due to \\"geographical restrictions\\", even though the Amazon Appstore says the product is compatible with the Kindle Fire HD and recommends download.<br /><br />It is only after wasting plenty of time and reading the terms of use that this becomes apparent. The forums are full of people in other countries with the same issues. Great! The world stops at New York and LA!<br /><br />Lift the restrictions, or be prepared for plenty of people asking for a refund for Kindles.
0425263916|4.0|Yes! Thank God that this was not another<br />50 shades want-to-be (unlike Bared to You). We get to see more of Gideon Cross<br />and how much he really loves Eva(until death do us part). The 4 star rating was due to the way some<br />parts of the book flowed.  I was like what the hell is going on??? but all became clear by the end.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app except it calls me names and it deleted all my coins I did not like that
B002NEFL8W|5.0|Wow! Where do I begin ? This battery grip is amazing!! For my 7D I try to only buy Canon products. The price was very competitive and I love its versatility. I can even use regular AA batteries should I choose. This comes in handy when shooting an all day event and I've run through my two Canon batteries. This is a great unit .
B006OAB2XO|5.0|Some of the tracks are so beautiful that they will change your life. Some trakcs are not as good. Genesis and Oblivion are the best 2 songs.
0545128285|5.0|I'm a huge Harry Potter fan.  This was an awesome read.  Easy and fun at the same time.  My kids love it too.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|OMG a don't miss opportunity for hours of fun!!  The graphics are great and the challenges are well balanced.  The upgrades add to the fun and the variety of customers keeps all levels so entertaining.  It's a game you'll be glad you own.  Get ready to keep wanting all the Diner Dash games on your Kindle.
0930289234|5.0|Alan Moore is a brilliant writer. This is one of his best works, if not the best. If you don't know Moore yet, this is a great starting point. The art by Dave Gibbons is fantastic with an enormous amount of detail; it is something to truly admire. This story deals with history and time and what superheros would be like in the real world. Would they change the outcome of wars? But it is more than about just super heroes, it is all about the human condition. It probes much farther than any comic book before has gone and even probes at the meaning of life and existence in a beautiful and deeply intelligent way. The style of this book is very sex, drugs, and rock and roll, while being very cerebral. There is a story within the story that parallels main story and the two are woven together so well that it is fascinating and staggering, a writing and artistic feat to behold. Ambitious young writers take note, you will never be Alan Moore.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is an amazing, insightful book that should be read by everyone. I was inspired and motivated by it as it is written by someone who has witnessed suffering and gained enormous insight from it.There is no self pity but the soul of this wonderful man is laid bare. I only wish I could have met him but at least he has left a wonderful legacy in this and his other books. I am recomending it to anyone who wants to know how to really live. Logotherapy is something I am now exploring for my own benefit and in my work.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is great an addicting. I would definitely get and it is great in the kindle fire. It definitely different from the first temple run so if you think it might be the same, you thought wrong!!!!
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|The first book shes written that I have read that I was not that thrilled about! Usually im so engrossed i dont put her books down until i am done reading them, and it took two weeks or maybe a little more to get through this one, and its not even a long one!
B000CNESU8|5.0|It was award-winning when it was first released and it is even better now...this movie has so much truth in it about our mental states that it's scary. Just saw it for the first time recently (2012) and it is jawdropingly profound by today's standards also.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season so far of the walking dead since season1. Season2 was a bit slow for me. No more farm house and waaay more zombies in this season.

B0063IH60K|1.0|I love Solitaire but this one was very annoying with all the ads that pop up.  It may be free, but that's even too much!  Very disappointed!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|like Mario but for tablets so pretty cool. no real power ups and kinda challenging. entertaining and good time waster
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It reeled me in and kept me addicted the whole book. There are a lot of parts you don't see coming
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its addicting. and iI like how easy it is to get points for next games u actually just have to play it
B006LSZECO|2.0|Too cliche with few connections in the story line. Too much back and forth in time. Got half way through and quit reading it.
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|I really like these type of games. it took 4 years 2 download &amp; install but it was worth it ^^
B007JMW46U|4.0|A collection of short stories and nice to read when you just want to have fun with a mystery.<br />Doyle at his best.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I love the Tibetan bowl. This is a wonderful app. As a writer and SAHM, finding a way to focus on my writing is really difficult. This app allows me to block out all the distractions around me and focus only on the article I'm working on. Thank you for a fantastic app!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was intrigued but the first book just enough to move on to the second. This book has piqued my interest and I've become fully invested. I can't wait to start the last book.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love my pretty bright pink Kindle Fire cover.  It is easy to find anywhere - house, purse, car - because of the nice bright color.<br />It is very lightweight.  I love the ability to stand the book up for a no hands method of reading; come in very handy while eating.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|App works well and offers tons of sounds - something for everyone. So much more diverse then buying a &#34;white noise&#34; machine.
0805028846|5.0|Es un libro muy hermosos y para aquellas personas que estan empezando en el pop-up, como yo, es muy útil...lo estoy descubriendo poco a poco por que trae una muy completa información  y sobre todo muchas técnicas para uno mismo hacer sus proyectos

B009ERK35W|4.0|Cronenberg's last &#34;Cronenberg film&#34;. The plot gets more tangled, twisty and surreal the further down the rabbit hole of &#34;game levels&#34; this allegorical sci fi tale for the video game era goes. Its conception predates &#34;Inception&#34; by more than a decade but when you think about it, it's part of a larger panoply of real-versus-the-dream movies going all the way back to &#34;The Wizard of Oz&#34;. If you're completing your collection of Cronenberg movies - or your collection of &#34;head&#34; movies - you can't forget this one.

B007NQVRNS|4.0|This review is for the blu-ray transfer only, not the film itself.  The blu-ray version of Frequency is excellent.  Even though this is a mystery/drama where hi-def is not necessary, it is always a joy to see a movie in the best possible resolution, and this is it.  Even night and indoor scenes look crisp.  The colors are strong.  The sound was also good, with one minor quibble--gunshots sound very weak in a couple of scenes, more like popguns.  This was only a mild annoyance, however.  Everything else sounded fine.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, it is worth it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is an interesting read and may convince some nonbelievers to reconsider, but even if not, it still is a facinating read!
B002QBS9KE|5.0|I needed that replacement.  It works just like they said it would.  I am glad I can use my headset again
B003V1WTMM|5.0|I loved this book!  The storyline was fascinating, and the flashbacks to England in the early and mid 20th century kept the narrative moving.  This book is suspenseful, romantic, and vivid.  The characters are so intriguing that I didn't want to leave them.  A must read for readers who love a good romantic mystery.
B008JAGZDE|5.0|Very,very funny movie. We watched all of the other movies from this serie and as always we laught very loud.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A beautiful story, it's very sad but worth the read. Colleen Hoover showed great depth in her two main characters.
B008KEQMDC|5.0|The whole family really had fun watching this movie :) I would suggest this movie to anyone that wants to laught.
B005FHXB0O|4.0|Recommended by husband's coworker.  Played well through WII on TV.  Movie is quintessential Tarentino.  Harsh language, bloody, lil' racist, violent, movie-music-celebrity obsession and rough.  Makes one think something happened to that guy as a kid that he'll never get over.
B009VB97EY|3.0|Besides the hard bodies of Mathew M. and Channing Tatum it's a pretty stupid movie. Watch it with a bunch of girlfriends for the dancing and laugh at the rest of it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|When we travel, I can see using this more.  Husband is the real weather-junkie but he rarely uses at home-base.  Probably we will use more during storm seasons. Useful.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I'm ashamed that I've bought all three of these and read them. Admittedly, it was before they were best sellers and I was surprised they became so popular. Poorly written and unsexy. If you find this well written and sexy you haven't read a good book or had good sex in your life. Or you just have no imagination because I could imagine things much sexier than any of these.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|Pretty sure not my eyes but tiny and difficult to differentiate tiles.  I used twice and I will uninstall now.  Too bad.  I like the game, generally.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It's not sexy. It's written by someone who has never taken health class and learned how to describe sex organs. The main character is supposed to be American but sounds British and is supposed to be a college graduate who doesn't know how to use a computer or have email. With a degree in English. Really? Did I mention it's not sexy? Because that's the main draw. I've heard a lot of people being disgusted seeing their mothers or grandmothers reading this because they think they're getting turned on by it. If I saw someone in my family was reading this and I found out they thought this was a titillating read I would feel sad for them because they've obviously never had an exciting sexual encounter in their life. And everyone should have that at least once. Lets just say I Anastasia and I are very close in experience level and I know that the area 'down there' and in my 'lower abdomen' is a vulva. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Okay but it bogged down.  And the ending.  If my husband left me for as long as hers did I don't hink I would want him back.  Actually the stalker cared more for her than her family even though he initated the brain damage.
B0084LQHN6|5.0|I know that there has been some negative press about her recently but I absolutely adore Azealia Banks' music. I don't know what my ears were doing before they first heard '212' but it obviously wasn't anything important. She sounds like old school lil' kim with a dance club vibe that I LOVE. I fell like I need to put on some pumps and dance the house down. And she can sing a little bit which is great. I'm not going to make any grand statements about the state of rap or female rappers and just say that I enjoy her music and there's always a song or two of hers on all of my playlists. If you're looking to get into her this is a good start before her album comes out. Also 'Luxury' which isn't on this EP is a great song to get into.
B004P8JPS6|3.0|The story was slow going but it was interesting.  Maybe I'm weired but what bothered me is he nevered changed his underwear or socks.  I wished the author would consider having the hero take a small bag with a change of clothes instead of thinking a real man doesn't need to change clothes or brush his teeth with tooth paste.  Makes you wonder abouth the AUTHOR AND HIS HABITS.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I would love to have a sit down with someone who is legitimately turned on by these books. And I would like to show them some REAL erotica and see them faint from something that is actually sexy. Because aside from being poorly written and imagined, a watered down version of a series that was ALREADY terrible (do I really have to say it? Twilight) It has the most dry and predictable sex scenes I have ever read. For gods sake she calls her vagina 'down there' in EVERY. SINGLE. BOOK.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Dude I love this book I have never read a better book<br />I want more books of diary of a wimpy kid
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I didn't want to start a new television odyseey but I'm very glad I started this one. My wife and I started watching from the beginning of the series in late December. We are fully caught up after several marathons. Using Prime has been great!
B000TU16GS|5.0|This book is fantastic! It kept me reading! I hope the next book is just as good! TO THE NEXT BOOK!!! ALLONS-Y!

B0012TWRAO|5.0|This is excellently made and held up to my super vibrating XS650. That included hardware was easy to install and excellently made.

B004SIP8SY|4.0|We are a a bit crazy, have been watching Kill Bill one and two every christmas night for several yrs. now, special because we watched it with someone very precious in our lives, also like the movie :)  thanks for great service!
B004XWLN20|5.0|i had fun going through the whole series and bonus and extra stuff. great show and everything was in good condition.
B000006YXV|2.0|Gave this as a give adn the CD does not play on a brand new notebook with CD/DVD player using Windows 7.  Don't understand that with today's technology, this should not be an issue and is unacceptable.
B008K8X0IS|5.0|I got this beauty on sale for $40 and it's worth every penny! This show is amazing! Sticks to the same plot line as the books, and has superb acting! This deluxe pack, with the bluray, DVD, and digital copy, it's a fantastic value. Plus the tiny dragon's egg!!! So worth it.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|Despite all the goofy antics (which are quite enjoyable), HOTEL TRANSYLVANIA is a tale of accepting change and recognizing the importance of individuality.  Count Dracula doesn't want to lose his young daughter Mavis to the outside world--and to humans---and the monsters use the hotel to ensure safety from those \\"monstrous\\" humans.  Chaos erupts when teenaged human Jonathan winds up as an intruder and falls for Mavis.<br />The monsters include scores of classic creatures from werewolves to Oz's wicked witch and the Blob.  There are many hilarious vignettes involving these monsters and the film clips along quite nicely when it focuses on these scenes.  HOTEL drags a little when lengthy scenes involving the love story and \\"serious\\" toned segments slow the pacing.<br />The voice casting is well done with Steve Buscemi the scene-stealing Wolfman.  There's nothing extraordinary about the animation, but ultimately HOTEL TRANSTLVANIA is delightful fun and appealing to both kids and adults.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After noticing how it's been a best seller, I thought \\"why not\\" and this book is by far one of my best reads in a long time.  Not only does this book include love, lust, heartache, and twists, Colleen did a great job of allowing the reader to feel every emotion Sky, the main girl, has felt throughout the entire book.<br /><br />Hopeless will make you smile, laugh, gasp, and maybe even cry.<br /><br />It's well worth $3.99!! I highly recommend.
B0070Y46UY|2.0|After the review of &#34;it will make you believe in God&#34; I was looking forward to an interesting story. I loved the beginning about zoology and religion, but the lost at sea part seemed rather boring and dragged at times and then the surprise ending was just disturbing and abrupt. I cant recommend it.
B002BI6SMI|4.0|I couldn't watch it because interruption occurred. My PC did not have  the requirements to  enjoy it. I hope you do
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I easily get sucked in to the real arcade game, so this had me from level 1. It's hard in the early levels waiting for more coins to regenerate, but I now have this game on 2 different devices which helps. Be careful which prizes you sell to get more coins, some don't come up often. Overall - love the game and its worth paying to lose the ads.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|Why, having paid more for my kindle fire hd in the UK , am I not allowed to download this very useful app?
B005NJU8PA|4.0|Tim Ferriss' &#34;The 4-Hour Chef&#34; is a cook book that teaches you how to learn.<br /><br />The book is split into two main sections. One focuses on how we learn, what motivates us, and how to improve our current skills. Tim sites several studies and includes his view on what has worked for him and why he thinks a method works for learning. The goal for Tim is to help break down the daunting task of learning something new and complex (cooking) and break it down into small manageable chunks.<br /><br />The second part of the book focus on actually cooking and recipes. The recipes are meant to teach you skills in a particular order that Tim believes will help you build your skills in a correct order. The recipes are probably better than what most of make on a regular basis, but do not expect recipes from Bobby Flay or The Barefoot Contessa. But, that is the point Tim is not interested in giving you recipes he is interested in trying to teach you how to cook so that when you try a new cook book you don't end up giving up after the first two recipes you make fail.<br /><br />In conclusion, if you are not a very good cook and want a good read that will help you get better than this is a good is book for you. If you are interested in how to learn skills quickly and efficiently this is a book you should read. If you can already cook and are looking for new recipes, then your time may be better served with an actual cook book.
B005C0DHEY|1.0|This movie has been completely discredited by Frack Nation.  This documentary literally lies about what is happening and the producer was caught red handed in the lies and claimed they are irrelevant.
0307352153|5.0|When I first received Susan Cain's book called Quiet:  The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking, I laughed at the generous size of it.  Introverts are supposed to be more the silent type, and ones who keep to themselves.  Least that's what the world would have you think.  It seems to be a bit of an oxymoron to read such a well-researched and lengthy book about those of us who prefer silence over noise.  Seems that finally an introvert is speaking out.<br /><br />The book is impressive, and gave me hope as one who was pressured as a child to be part of the crowd.  And while being an introvert isn't the new cool, Cain shows a great deal of respect to that personality type (of which she is one).  She tells of famous individuals who, while introverted, achieved great success.  Some of those are Rosa Parks, Bill Gates, and other names you'd be familiar with.<br /><br />Her research is amazing, and the book is equipped with her detailed notes, and also reader's helps at the back.  She includes information for raising an introverted child (which I wish my parents had been able to read), and tips for educators.  It seems she's covered it all.<br /><br />And while she makes it clear that introversion isn't a curse, she does offer validation to those of us who have lived with criticism for not being on the cutting edge of conversations and parties.  To be quiet is okay.  To be silent is acceptable, no matter if anyone agrees with you or not.<br /><br />Many thanks, Susan Cain for the encouragement.<br /><br />(i received this book free to review from waterbrook/multnomah)
B007PBL9KC|5.0|I really do love this album and had heard it many times before purchasing it from Amazon's MP3 service from applications like Spotify and Pandora. I was able to download this album and import it into my iTunes in lieu of an MP3 credit that I received and i could not be happier. I love this band's first studio album, especially the tracks 'From Finner' and 'Yellow Light', and look forward to what they come out with in the future! :)

B00B49L7JY|5.0|Searching for Sugar Man is the story of a truly genuine person, well balanced and sincere without pretentiousness. Not only is the documentary very well done, it is a remarkable story of a person living true to himself. Outstanding!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. Hopeless was just amazingly written and the story was unlike anything I've read out there. The cadence of the book was great and she created a very beautiful love story in the midst of tragedy.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love to listen to all and I mean all of the ringtones and it makes me want to get up in the morning
0060873175|1.0|This  reads like a bad screen adaptation of a worse book crafted by a middle school student. I kept waiting for it to turn around but it just kept getting worse. Characters were boring at best and die faster than a J.R.R Martin novel. The willing suspension of disbelief required to stomach the main plot holes alone will suck out your soul.
B00992CF6W|5.0|yeah so I was all excited for 0.6.0 but then I tried to get this morning for my kindle fire and it says that there isn't an update for it...then I checked my ipod and it says that the 0.6.0 update is already out! what gives man???
B0089OBLDO|5.0|Didn't read that little part about needing the original xbox controller. Who still owns one of those things?? Anyway now I'm shelling out extra cash to get one and see if this thing actually works.<br />*Update: Device works as promised but you do need a wired xbox 360 joystick to get it rolling!
B005LAII8K|4.0|Yes, forget the chips and dips, at least in the beginning of the movie; you will need to focus your full attention on it just to keep up.  After a while, all the pieces start to fit together and the movie actually begins to make sense.  I loved the movie, and will enjoy seeing it again now that I understand the storyline.  I enjoyed Bruce Willis, too, but he is right there, ready to cross the line where he will be too old and will look ridiculous playing another \\"tuff guy\\".  Unless it's in a parody, of course.

B007LE2VDM|4.0|It was a good song and the price was cheap and affordable.  I would buy it again and again.  Whew 20!
1616550414|5.0|This is a perfect book for all Zelda fans. It has so much artwork and information from all the Zelda titles. The price is just right for how much this book has to offer and honestly there isn't much to get into with this book. If you played any Zelda game and of course if you have you have played all the others then this book is a MUST HAVE as it really compliments any living room with coffee table books as well as any Zelda collection.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as this is what I would want in an artbook/coffee table/collectors book of Zelda.
B00A1XIXM8|5.0|You can only compare bad religion albums to other bad religion albums, and in my eyes the strongest are probably Suffer and No Control.  That is, until True North.  Time will tell if it becomes the best of all, but that it's even a consideration for me is a very pleasant surprise.<br /><br />The funny thing about True North is that at first it sounds like crap.  All the songs run together, the hooks sound way to obvious, every BR \\"cliche\\" seems to be shoe horned in... even the drum beats (bass, snare, 2xbass, snare).  Nothing seems in place on that first listen. Nothing stands out. I was a little sad after initially hearing it because I thought BR finally jumped the old shark. But I gave it another spin, in the hopes I would find some redemption in it.<br /><br />It took me till about the third listen when it started to crack open.  The songs need closer inspection.  In fact, some need to be heard by themselves, because next to each other with almost no space between them it's hard to appreciate what you're listening to.  But start up any of the 16 tracks fresh, and you'll hear it.  These songs are brilliant.  Every single one of them.<br /><br />And that's why I think it stands up to the very best BR album.  There isn't one bad song.  Even the worst song is pretty good. the first time you sing along to the chorus to the title track?  ahhh it's like coming home, and there's a plate of fresh cookies.<br /><br />Bad Religion, please don't ever stop making music.it even though it's messing my hearing up! hahah for a little bit anyway.  Bad Religion, please don't ever stop making music.

B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This game is a lot fun. I give it to my grandson to play and it keep him busy for a long time.
B004Q7DQLS|3.0|The main girl, Pia, was pretty likable and believable, although the Dragon in it was kinda overbearing.  His personality is explained in the book and it makes sense, but it didn't make him any more endearing.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I have not used this much and I have not played chess for a while, so I don't know whether the levels are sufficiently challenging.  However, it seems to be fine.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|To me the first few weren't challenging, but it's gotten crazier. Everything is free so that's a major plus. If you like puzzles and maps, this is a really good game
B004UID2LC|3.0|i use this quite a bit on the Kindle Fire to watch YouTube content.  I would have given it a higher rating if all YouTube videos could be viewed with it, but many can only be played within the YouTube app itself, according to the error messages.

B007STBUIW|5.0|A young, up and coming director, Steven Spielberg took an ambitious book by Peter Benchley, a turned it into one of the most memorable films of all time.  John William's title score is so recognizable, only two notes are needed to instantly instill fear in the hearts of anyone venturing into the ocean (or even your backyard swimming pool!)  Roy Scheider plays the everyday hero, a reluctant, scared-of-the-water police Chief, Martin Brody.  Faced with a series of shark attacks on the island he recently just called home, he battles not only nature, but the politics of Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton.)  With the help of a young Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and a salty old sea dog, the mysterious Quint (Robert Shaw), the three set sail to battle a fish unlike anything they've ever seen.  The haunting performance by Shaw is capped by his memorable &#34;Indianapolis Speech,&#34; while Dreyfuss' youth and stubbornness lend well to his character.  Perhaps one of the unsung stars of the movie is the town of &#34;Amity Island&#34; (Martha's Vineyard, MA) where the local townsfolk, the scenery, and the quaint New England mood make this more than just a horror flick, but rather a sea-faring epic of the ages.  The bonus footage, including the stellar documentary &#34;The Shark Is Still Working&#34; make this a must have for any cinema buff.  &#34;The Shark Is Still Working&#34; is the not-for-profit, love of Jaws documentary which explains why this film is such a legend in film.  The documentary goes on to explain how the film was the first true summer blockbuster, and the highest grossing film at the time.  Still to this day, sharks are called &#34;Jaws&#34;, the familiar &#34;dun-dun&#34; of William's theme is widely used today.  Get this remastered, superb audio and visual treat, and be sure to watch The Shark Is Still Working to appreciate how truly unique of a film Jaws really is.
0439023491|5.0|Sometimes with a trilogy, it can seem that the middle book slows down the action and drags the series down.  Not so with \\"Catching Fire\\" the second installment in Suzanne Collins' \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy.  The author picks up right where the previous novel left off and doesn't slow down for one instant.  Readers will have a hard time putting this book down, and when you finish, you will be immediately hungry for more.  I can't imagine having read these while they were still being published - waiting a year for the third must have been torture!<br /><br />Fresh off their double win in the Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta find themselves on the obligatory Victory Tour, a tour of all of the districts in Panem.  Yet all is not well beneath the glossy surface of the Capitol.  Katniss receives a personal visit from President Snow who wasn't fooled by the game she and Peeta played in the arena and he wants to make sure that any sparks of rebellion she may have ignited don't spread any further.  Katniss was unaware of any rebellion, yet as she and Peeta visit the districts, especially District 11, they realize that things are not what they seem and that certain people are ready to try to overthrow the government.  Katniss is not sure where she stands in all of this, other than that many see her as the symbol for their rebellion.  New peacekeeping measures are put in place, and the lax rules in District 12 are soon revoked and everyone is on edge as stocks and a gallows fills the town square.  With the next round of the Hunger Games coming up, President Snow dishes out a wild surprise; previous victors are to be this year's tributes, so Katniss and Peeta find themselves headed back to their worst nightmares.  However, this time it is certain that both of them won't be able to win.  The second half of the novel is devoted to this round of the Games and the pair's attempts to befriend the other tributes, former victors who seem all too willing to team up.  How can they kill these tributes if they are friends?  And how can Katniss guarantee Peeta's safety when so many are working on a plan unbeknown to them?<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" is a difficult book to put down.  The action never slows and Collins introduces a wide variety of new characters who truly add to the action.  The more that Katniss learns about the government, the more she's certain she wants a rebellion, but it's so hard to tell who's on her side and who her true enemies are.  Collins does a masterful job of creating suspense and bringing to life a dystopian world that is not hard to believe could exist.  I could hardly wait to read the third novel after I finished this one, for I wanted to make sure that it ended as it should.e tributes if they are friends?

B00009W0WM|5.0|Even someone who isn't a movie buff can appreciate Casablanca.  A dramatic, moody tale of romance, intrigue, danger, and despair.  Your heart is tugged by Bogart and Bergman, and even the ever-dramatic Peter Lorre makes a memorable scene or two.  What made this movie so much more interesting was not just the subject matter, but when it was released.  At the very dawn of America's involvement in World War II, it was a rousing, if not slightly propagandist film, a film of defiance against tyranny, and a show of selfless love beyond even romance.
B000SEIDR0|2.0|While I was interested in the topic, it simply could not hold my interest.  I didn't want to pick it up and read it.
B004ULNJF8|5.0|Chalk another solid performance from Statham.  Strong, gritty, crime drama which seems to borrow some themes from the Dirty Harry sagas, while mixing a bit of Snatch-like British action.  The villain is well played and creepy enough to make you root for Statham.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Bought this for my son, what a great movie, very entertaining.  We had both seen it at the theater, but my husband watched this for the first time and loved it.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|2012 had some great movies, but a movie that uses real, active-duty SEALs is as good as it gets.  This movie proves these men are good at pretty much anything they want to do, including act.  Solid story, appears to be very accurate military terminology, and you care for the characters.  Highly recommend this movie.

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I think this is a great app.........But it needs more TIME!!!!! please make it at least an hour.Do YOU agree? If you do please say how long and keep picking at it so they'd will change it!!!!!!!!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone who lives in fear of dying. Dr. Alexander has been very thorough in explaining his experience. There are many people who back up his report. Science backs up his story!

B0043RSK3K|4.0|Read for the facts...an important addition to our history. A must read for all of us and a nice addition to the Showtime series.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|I ordered this movie for my husband, who is a retired veteran. We both love the way it was presented.
B009JBZH54|5.0|So glad that I got a PS3 so that I could play Blu-rays, like these movies!<br />-There's no reason to actually go into reviewing the movies themselves, because that's what iMDB is for (but I will say they are FREAKING AMAZING!), but they all work perfectly, and look/sound beautifully.<br />-The packaging looks/is awesome.<br />-It comes with a little book, which is a selection of imagery from \\"The Art And Making Of The Dark Knight Trilogy,\\" which has a little over 60 pages of random pictures, concept art, and behind the scenes pictures of the 3 films (very cool to look through).<br />-Comes with Ultraviolet copies (which I've actually never bothered with before, but figured I could make these movies my first). If you haven't used this before, then it'll explain how to get everything. But it doesn't explain that you're actually going to be using a program called \\"Flixster\\" which is where all the magic happens. I'm pretty sure you stream your movies with Flixster, but since I don't rely on streaming, I downloaded the movies to my computer so I could watch them whenever (not to mention they look pretty damn good in Standard Definition!). If you want to take your movies with you on the go, then you'll need to get the \\"Movies by Flixster\\" App on your mobile device (iOS, or Android. I don't have any other type, so I don't know about them). Then you can sign in, and download the movies onto that. Sadly it isn't going to look perfect, but that's because the downloads aren't in Blu-ray ;)<br />-Comes with a bonus discs for each movie (though I haven't watched any, I'm sure they're cool to watch as well).<br /><br />If you love, or even just like the movies, and you have a Blu-ray player, I'd say this collection is a must buy!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I haven't received it, but I LOVED the movie in the theater!! I can't wait for the DVD in Blu-Ray!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great period piece. Experiencing the joy and sarrow of people upstairs and downstairs.  Watch the remaining episodes on streaming. Sympathy to Lady Mary and Congrats on the Heir

B008HK3XOU|5.0|The case is well made and fits the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; perfectly. I look forward to using it for Skype calls.
B004QX07G4|3.0|I found the books to drag in several places. I love to watch Ellen DeGeneres, but this could have been better.
B005COO1X6|2.0|Although there were elements of this story I enjoyed, I was disappointed with the story as a whole. For 80 pages you feel like you are being led to a pretty surprising conclusion or a startling revelation but, in the end, everything just kinda fell flat. That's not to say that I won't read King ever again. I really like the way he writes. This one just didn't turn out the way I thought it would. But I will say you should give it a try because of the low price.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A wonderful story. Life does not stop when you become a senior. Thought provocking and heart warming! Will share this story with friends!
B002N5N5M0|5.0|If you are just getting into Dexter and want to see the rest of the seasons I recommend buying them all since it is great to catch up so you know where everything is coming from
B002O5M4SA|5.0|One of the classic action movies along with Die Hard. Action-packed and with a great villain in Gary Oldman. Gary plays it fantastically and is much more subtle with his psychosis than many Hollywood villains are now
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Requiring a wi-fi connection to download was a pain in the butt, but it was free and was fun when I had it installed, but uninstalled since it kept asking for wi-fi connection to update.
1616550414|5.0|Let me start by saying that I absolutely LOVE the Zelda series. I've grown up with it and it continues to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />That being said, the book does more than enough to please me as a fan. The concept art is beautiful and the information is amazing. Specifically, this book offers the \\"official timeline,\\" \\"linking\\" all of the games together (pun not intended). That alone was well worth the money, but this book offers so much more. Not to mention, the cover is amazing as well (the symbols on the front are in accordance to the Oracle of Ages songs, my favorite handheld Zelda thus far).<br /><br />In conclusion, if you're a Zelda fan, you NEED this. If you aren't, it's still incredibly beautiful and should be considered.
B000V86OKG|5.0|The season that continued hooked, what could be better than catching up on the season that got you started on Dexter.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I thought the game was okay but it could be better if they tried to make it better but I guess it's fun when your bored
B002WY65W4|5.0|one of the funnier movies ive seen, also great that it has emma stone in it. It is definitely  a movie you can watch repeatedly
B004GHNIRK|3.0|So far so good. Easy to access and read. I had no problem acquiring the book. I look forward to reading the other books I downloaded.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|having the option to play blu ray, dvd, 3d and digitally is great, not to mention the movie is also a great one

B00B1E6FF8|3.0|Saw Zero Dark Thirty and was not impressed.It centres around a woman CIA operative (Jessica Chastain) who works on location in Pakistan and Afghanistan pursuing Osama Bin Laden through the use of torture.She observes torture and is at first seen to flinch,but she soon seems able to accept it.Because she's a female heroine and not an action hero,we do not get the gung-ho approach of male directors.As a feminist she cools the subject using a woman.<br /><br />The film's opening,dark screen and phone call from a woman trapped in the Twin Towers about to burn to death.Then the film flips immediately into scenes of torture as in cause and effect.Because we have been assured the film is \\"based on first person accounts\\" and that Bigelow herself said to depict it is not to endorse it,we are made to feel we are getting the `first draft of history',a journalistic account,but it's claimto apolitical neutrality is false.Bigelow is for the patriotic status quo.<br /><br />This is a CIA-biased film,right wing to the core.It achieves its objective to give some meaning to the killing of Osama Bin Laden by showing terrorist attacks following 9/11(Khobar Towers,the Islamabad Marriott)as well as the unbridled CIA response.The war on terror is seen as justified revenge.At the `black sites' CIA investigators like Dan(Jason Clarke) seek information about the whereabouts of the al-Qaeda leader,using soft and hard techniqueslike water-boarding or giving a soft drink to the suspect,treating him like a dog or chatting to him like a mate.<br /><br />To depict torture neutrally is already a kind of endorsement.Bigelow is shown to be on the side of torture. Maya loses friends in the field.Her fanaticalpursuit of Bin Laden helps to neutralise moral qualms.Bigelow eases liberal guilt by showing the effect on the torturer's sensitivity,Maya pays a cost,having no love or relationships.Our instincts tell us there is something wrong here.To normalise torture(we see Obama saying they don't use torture),is to remove ethical principles.It directly implies the use of torure led directly to the location of OBL(Abbadabad).<br /><br />That said the thriller/action techniques of Bigelow(as proved in Hurt Locker),the film editing/writing are good,<br />the chapter-like structure,the casting of Chastain where her intelligence is underscored by a ferocious determination,\\" I believed I was spared so I could finish the job\\".This is an emotionless and cold-hearted film so much so that the climactic raid has no energy or urgency,the role of the Navy Seals is de-emphasised,ciphers in a computer game.Sorry Syriana and Homeland did this so much better.Chastain does not carry the moral weight.
B004SBX112|5.0|Looks and works great, just like described. Very fast shipping. Recommend it for any person looking for an inexpensive, but great item.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great clock. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. 18 more words required. Is that 18 words yet?  Did I say it is a great clock?

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Makes me think. You will not get bored because it is too easy! Really a great game for all ages.
B008JLEUD0|5.0|Beautiful voice & music! Message of the lyrics are thoughtful and chilling - all Americans should listen carefully to this beautiful young lady.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Really fun game much like Bejeweled Blitz on Facebook.  Wish it gave a more obvious score.  A little hard to drag the stars around. I keep &#34;missing&#34; and have to try again. I have never experienced that before with my Kendall Fire so i am attributing it to the game.  Sorry if it just me.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a very difficult book to put down.  It grabs your interest from the first page and continues on a very erotic journey.  A must book for those who can handle many sexual situations.  Tastefully written!
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Love this movie! Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie!Love this movie! Good family movie.
086571701X|3.0|This book was very basic.  Most of the content is on the Internet.  It didn't tell me anything that I already didn't find for free.
0761171703|5.0|As a dancer and dance teacher this book will inspire anyone to not only dance but think about dance as a part of your everyday life. Which allows you to open up when you are dancing. I recommend this book to anyone not just dancers to be inspired to be the best you can be!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Great case and cover, very affordable!! I got it for my wife and she loves it. I recommend this to anyone.
B006RED4GA|2.0|Did have some scary parts though.  Some of the cinematography was pretty good. Acting was also suprisingly decent, too. 2.5.
B00000IREA|5.0|I Love all the action and some of the clothing. Its great when she breaks the sex mashine.<br />I would recomend it for everyone.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Holy shit! Not what I expected.... can't wait to read the next. On to book number 3. Hope you enjoy as much as I did. :)
B008AK8FHM|4.0|There were many similarities and yet many differences to our experiences. LOVE and the greatest feeling of peace and joy as well as the knowledge of God was a common occurrence.  I have had a family member as well as two good friends who experieced NDEs as well. One was a physician and we shared our experience.  It is something I have always been very interested in so it took me no time to read Dr. Alexander's book. I found it very appealing
1451673442|5.0|I recommend this book to everyone to read all ages. It is a practical guide about experiencing more gratitude and genuine gratitude in your life.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The app is entertaining and fairly easy to navigate. Wish it wouldn't freeze up so much but other than that its pretty cool.
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|the game was very very good and extremely enjoyable untill I got around level 40. I got off one night at level 40 and got back on the next day all the way back at level 1 with nothing at all in my zoo .. deleted the app after a couple of days of not hearing from gamelofts customer service ..
0547848412|5.0|I finished this book just after midnight last night. It took me several hours to fall asleep as my mind examined and re-examined the symbolism that is so abundant throughout this book.<br /><br />This is a story of survival on the high seas. If you only see it on that level, it is a fun adventure. But what makes it so powerful is that there is so much more.<br /><br />It is an allegory about the monsters we see in ourselves, the depths to which we are willing to go to survive. But it is also about the beauty in our world, the power of hope, the miracles of life, the terrors of death.<br /><br />It is also about the power of a story, a fable, a myth. What truths do we cling to? Do we really know what is true, and how is truth changed by the filters of our perception?<br /><br />I don't often reread books but this is one I definitely want to read again. Near the end, on the island and also when he goes blind, I started feeling like it had reached a level where it was too unbelievable. Yet, in the light that the final ending casts, it makes those parts even more amazing. It is those parts in particular, that I would like to revisit the most.<br /><br />This book is a masterpiece that I haven't yet fully wrapped my mind around. I absolutely love it.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone. I am still reading and really appreciate her writing this book! Helps to increase my faith.
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Again Anthony Hopkins and Ryan Gosling.. You can't go wrong!  It keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Way more fun then the first one love the powerups admire exciting course and it's wicked awesome also love the prices are cheaper for stuff
B009HEJXFS|5.0|This movie was very entertaining for the whole family. This sparked an interest in the other 2 movies. We love the Men In Black characters and who wouldn't love a laugh.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I almost didn't want to finish this book because i didn't want it to end!! I have never literally laughed out loud & received strange looks from my family while reading! This had so many different emotions that all blended beautifully. Although the main characters are young, i would recommend this book to anyone who wants to laugh, cry, & have their heart melt!<br />Colleen Hoover, you are AMAZING!!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was GREAT. I laughed so hard my side hurt. The movie was watched by me and my husband and was great as our date night move.
0913866156|4.0|not the vintage edition i was hoping for but the actual art is gorgeously colored and classic. the only drawback is the obnoxious white border around the edges of the backs of the cards.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Great twist on fairy tale favorites.  Well written and characters &#34;come to life&#34; in roles well executed by cast.  &#34;Clean&#34; entertainment...finally!
0525478817|5.0|Don't let that dreary back cover copy deter you-this is a beautiful book!  John Green covers the whole range of human emotion in this gem of a YA novel.  He mixes big-time tragedy, complicated and interesting characters, and a surprisingly funny cancer support group to serve up one sublime cocktail of a story.<br /><br />Sixteen year old Hazel has cancer.  The extra bad kind.  She meets Augustus at her cringe-worthy support group and sparks fly.  We watch them fall in love, grapple with issues of morality, life, and death, and face their uncertain futures together.  Even Hazel's character states, \\"Cancer books suck.\\"  This is not such a book.<br /><br />I was impressed with the emotional depth of both Hazel and Augustus.  Unlike most YA novels, the big bad evil awful keeping them apart is the ugly reality of a future, or lack of it, with cancer.  We witness two young people facing a crash course in growing up, and deciding what is really important in their lives.  It reads as a true, totally believable love story.  It's far more than that, though.<br /><br />With all this seriousness, though, it's still an extremely witty novel.  I actually laughed while reading it, which is rare for me.  Green is a master with realistic dialogue.  He writes teens with compassion and utter understanding.<br /><br />Please give this gem a try.  You'll be happy you did.
B005XN31LY|5.0|We all have our favorite fairy tale characters that we enjoyed as children, now with OUAT we have an opportunity to enjoy them all over again as adults.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I did not think I would like this movie but once it entered my home, I watched it 3 times.  I love it.  Jennifer Lawrence was so good in this movie.  She deserves all the success that she is enjoying.  The Hunger Games brings 2 children, ages 2 - 18 together from each district (I guess you could compare this to the U.S. States) to fight until there is only 1 person left alive.  Jennifer Lawrence plays an older sister.  Her 12 year sister was called to play so Jennifer jumps in and volunteers so her sister doesn't have to go play the Games.  Hunger Games are no fun.  You constantly fear for you life.  There are many obstacles they have to overcome just to survive for even a day.  I don't want to be a spoiler so I won't tell anymore except they did find a way to have a little romance in this movie.  Good job.  I woud have never thought to do it the way that it was done. This romance sets up a love triange for the sequel.  I suggest that anyone any age watch this movie.  I loved it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved it!  I'm not a big reader, but I couldn't even put this one down.  I have finished another of Vince's books and am now starting my third.  If you liked Jason Bourne, you'll like Mitch Rapp.
B0053O89YM|5.0|If you like the Good Wife, then this is a great purchase. Season 3 doesn't disappoint, and I ended up watching the whole season in under 48 hours because I couldn't stop watching.

B000JQUHLM|5.0|A wonderful entertaining book of a young girls escapades.  Delighfully funny.  I would recommend it to any one who would like a light & happy book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really honestly like this game!! It's actually like taking care of your very own horse!! I just barely this game but I have been playing it non stop all day. It really is a great game!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I think I would like this book, but at the right time.  It seemed to be a little too heavy and complicated for me at this time.  I put it back and did not read it.
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This movie lacked everything. Sorely disappointed in the script and special effects. I think this will be the last I see in this series.
1455519006|5.0|This is the Baldacci style that entranced his readers when he first published. An excellent read . A gripping page turner.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|They tried to make this movie grittier than the original which they accomplished but much was lost in character development. The special effects were cool but the story 'retold' could have been better.
B009PEPML4|5.0|One of Canada's finest bands returns with another sweeping epic masterpiece.  If you are in the mood for some slow building cathartic tension and release, check this out.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game, nice graphics. Good for children and bored adults.most things cost gems which are not free but that is the only drawback so far.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is incredibly useful. The beautiful sounds and combinations of sounds helps one to drift off to sleep. I will also use this app when I want to relax. I especially enjoy combining sounds to create my own masterpiece. This is such an enjoyable, must have app!
0061478784|5.0|This is an amazing book, even better than the movie in depth and detail. The book arrived in perfect condition, and was cheaper than I'd hoped to find it for. I would recommend this for anyone who loves good fantasy books with a good bit of magic involved.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|It is a decent read, tells you the most important things about conversations, etc.  I read it in 2 sittings.

0740797719|5.0|Even a great painter can use this book. I've learned more about light color and paint thanks to this book.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I don't enjoy this game as much as others ie&#34; Solitaire .<br />I find it not as challenging and get rather bored at times
B0046ECFRM|5.0|**4.5 stars**<br /><br />You know when you are a teenager and you meet a cute boy at school? You inevitably become friends and there is always this subtle flirting, some innocent or not so innocent touches during conversations. You catch him looking at you sometimes, you think, but you aren't totally sure. The two of you talk on the phone every night but think to yourself that it is all just part of your friendship. The sexual tension just builds and builds and it is all gearing towards that one BIG KISS. I've been there, oh how I've been there.<br /><br />This magical, teenage times happens before \\"hooking up\\" means \\"sex\\" and no guy or girl settles for hour long phone calls that lead to nothing but meaningful glances. This time period lasted from ages 15-17 for me and I remember it fondly. This wonderful book brought it all back to me.<br /><br />\\"Anna and the French Kiss\\" was an uber-cute, squeaky clean, YA romance. I just adored this one. I thought it was really well done, not patronizing, and perfectly captured that feeling of building sexual and emotional tension leading up to something... more. The story was sweetly funny, and it wasn't a downer read, which many books in the YA can tend to be now and days. It was a great read and I really recommend it.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.<br />The suspense and anticipation on what would be found out next made it hard to put the book down.

B001NLKWLW|5.0|I really found this book interesting,sad and yet I kept reading it.<br />I would refer it to a friend.<br />I put myself in that time frame and can't imagine living in those circumstances
B001CU1RUE|5.0|Bought this for a friend as a gift, got fast shipping, excellent quality, and overall pleased with the performance and quality of the seller and the product. It was a big hit for my friend and I will definitely recommend it to others. + I love that is has those extra songs! :)
1582701709|1.0|I had a friend who read this book and then passed it along to me. I hold a bachelors in Physics and could not believe anyone would buy into this baloney. This is not science or even logical; it's just a bad case of wishful thinking. This is just like giving a \\"fortune\\" teller or \\"psychic\\" your money to hear what you want to hear. Please do not give this con-artist your money or your time. The real \\"secret\\" to being successful in life is to ask questions, seek answers, make mistakes and learn from them, and above all stay determined.
B005DOL0R0|2.0|Even though this cover was on sale it was way too much money for just a cover for the kindle fire
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love, love, love this wonderful series. Watch it. You will not be disappointed!!! Season 3 will definetly be keeping us on our toes...
1587613379|5.0|Ok, I was already poly before I read the book, but this book solidified my beliefs and helped me understand more about open relationships.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Hello,<br /><br />Never got to play this game much, but did see it felt the need to send out &quot;info&quot; 4 times a day, why?  Really didn't bother to find out, is wrong. Too bad, I love the movies/characters.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Good food for thought - dispels some myths about successful people.  Easy to read and understand - enjoyed the book!
B00479SVBU|1.0|I was hoping for something better. 1st time plugging into adapter the screen went blank, It would play but I have no control over it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! its great, has a lot of detail and graphics. perfect for all ages. I'm addicted, cant stop playing.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|its a great knife and it got to me in a short time. i might have to buy me another on for a back up. its built like a tank too. might i add that there is a knife for every job
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I have read every one of Ian Rankin's Rebus books, and this one is well worth reading. The crime(s) and the characters are complex, and Rebus is still very much an intriguing detective.
B005HGZV6U|5.0|I love absolutely anything Daft Punk-ish or Daft Punk-like. So of course I'm giving this product 5 stars!<br /><br />As for the quality and playability of the Blu-ray it's fine, no blurriness or skipped scenes.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Now, beware, this series is not finished as of 1/2013 so if it pains you to read a long, complicated series and not know how the story ends, you will experience discomfort.  After you read the 4 book bundle then you will hunt down book 5, A Dance with Dragons.  Dance with Dragons is just as complicated as the earlier works, maybe more so.  The story line is not resolved and you need, need the next book.  But Book 6, The Winds of Winter is not yet published.  I found this series very engaging but I hate to read a series not yet published.  Author Martin says will be 7 books in the series.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|JOHN AND KATE ARE AWESOME AND MOST ASSUREDLY THERE IS MORE TO COME! Nelson' s wit ,humour, and intrigue are hard to beat!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Reading The Black Box is like visiting with an old friend.  I wouldn't probably want to just hang with Harry in real life but in my fiction reading life it is great to be together.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Is one more 5-star review needed?  Probably not, but this set is so outstanding I had to at least say that!  What a joy.  Very nice extras also.  I even got my husband hooked on it!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I found this series to be engaging yet Book 6 and 7 are planned and not written.  Bummer for those of us that are caught up in the stories.  Love the HBO series.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This is a cute came. My 5 year old loves it. It is easy to play. The graphics are good. You earn stickers to put on the in game sticker board after you &#34;cure&#34; a couple of patients. You can change the beds to look different and you pick up trash and put it in the trash can. It keeps my son busy for quite a while. Good game for the preschool group.
B008X9Z37A|3.0|works fine as a cover i was hoping it could also be used as a stand for the kindle(easel style)
B00A80SHFM|2.0|First off, I love the movie, despite its flaws and cuts. I was anxious to purchase the CD. It said \\"highlights\\", but I decided to go ahead and get it anyway. I figured it would have most of the songs I wanted. There were definitely some good songs in here, but there are a few problems.<br /><br />1. A lot of songs were cut. Some, I didn't miss, like Lovely Ladies. There were some songs that were VERY important, that were just cut out. For instance, Fantine's Death/Come to Me is a turning point in the story. Another is Look Down with Gavroche singing, that is another pretty big song that should be on this CD. The two most disappointing ones however are Do You Hear the People Sing and A Little Fall of Rain. I mean, come on! Do You Hear the People Sing is like the theme song of the musical! And how could they cut out A Little Fall of Rain completely? They already butchered it in the movie, now it's not even on the CD? I wish I had read all of the songs before I bought this. That is one of my favorite songs. Oh and the Beggars at the Feast/Wedding song is gone. I prefer that over Master of the House.<br /><br />2. Then there's the cuts. Some of these songs just don't sound right. For instance, In My Life, Cosette's part is GONE. It jumps to Maruis' part. So the whole scene with Cosette wanting to know about her past, and even just saying she's in love, is completely cut. It doesn't sound right. I wish they had included more of the bishop scene, since that's when Colm Wilkinson is singing (he's awesome, by the way). What's CRAZY is they included The Final Battle which is just instrumental and a bit of gunfire, but they didn't bother to fix these songs? They should've taken out The Final Battle and either replaced it with one of the songs I mentioned earlier or at least do the full version of the songs they chopped up.<br /><br />3. My last complaint may not be a problem with anyone else, but it bothers me so I'm gonna put it out there. In Master of the House, the scene in the movie was pretty gross, and a little raunchy at one part. Yeah, well you can hear everything in it. The worst part is the part where they're making the meat, and you can hear all the squishes and the squirts and even the cat when it gets its tail chopped off. Ugh, it's so nasty! You can also hear the girl in the honeymoon suite. I normally enjoy Master of the House, but it's a bit too graphic for me. I can't get past the whole meat scene. Just, disgusting. I know it was recorded live, but they could've edited that out.<br /><br />Now the CD isn't all bad. I love listening to I Dreamed a Dream, On My Own, One Day More, Stars, Empty Chairs at Empty Tables, I could go on. I even like the new song Suddenly. And any song with Enjolras is good. I just hope they release a full soundtrack, that's not so picked over. Or just go buy the London Cast recording.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This free app from Amazon is amazing.  It will produce either a very bright light as if from a flashlight or an illuminated smartphone face, depending upon which one you want to use.  Thanks, Amazon!<br /><br />Red Baron 83
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover is amazing! I loved that there was  nothing simple about this story. She delicately navigated tough issues with class and true understanding. What a great read!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|enjoyed reading this while waiting at the hospital.  it was entertaining and light fare but still interesting.  Tina Fey is too funny
B00B2V66VS|1.0|If you're searhing for a bad game look no further. this game is awful for a number of reasons. One, is its horrible controls. 90% of the time when I am trying to turn on a corner, it won't respond. That or the character will jump off the road.... Secondly, there is no point to this game. There is no in-depth plot therefore there is no reason for a sequel. Lastly, Temple Run 2 shows exactly what is wrong with the gaming market today. It saddens me to see that companies find it necessary to slap together some horrible excuse of a sequel to a good game. Imangi appears to only have one excuse to creatingbthis game. FOR THE MONEY. rant over.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game of Thrones gives the reader insight into life of it's character's in times before the advent of representative government when right made things right.  The dynamics of personal and lineage politics were paramount to lifelong pursuits.  The portrayal of life is believable for the most part.  The infusion of mystic events while interesting are not essential to development of the story line.  Started on this series 4 weeks ago and have read all available Kindle e-books available.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This novel definitely has a unique twist.  I enjoyed the character development as it is woven into a great mystery.  I highly recommend this book!
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This case is very easy to use. Like the standup view so one doesn't have to hold onto the Kindle to read. ect.
145162607X|5.0|You know what to expect from Phillippa Gregory!  1400's, kings and queens, courts and castles, great intrigue and complex relationships.  This does not disappoint!  The novel, based on actual facts, pulls you in immediately, and reminds you that a world without iPhones, computers, and all our technology can be just as compelling and complex - it just takes a different form. In fact, we very likely lack the shrewd people skills that they had, because we isolate ourselves from \\"real\\" interactions.  I really like this author and have many yet to read...in front of a fire on a wintery day...
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it so much!<br />I love the detail and imagery . The Best Book I've Ever Read! I Give It 2 Thumbs Up!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I'm an avid &#34;scary things&#34; enthusiast. My perfect night is a glass of wine and something shocking/thrilling/disturbing/violent to watch on TV with my fiance. American Horror Story (seasons 1 & 2) both managed to keep me hooked. When you think about it, the creators of this show have managed to create a ~12 hour horror movie with numerous subplots and twists. Some things might be a bit hokey, but it's a show based on things that have debatable existence. It's going to happen.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My brothers have the update already on my little brothers HKC and on my older brothers iPhone and nexus7 can someone say when the update is for this type of system
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I loved the singing in this movie. Great Accapella music in this movie. Truly enjoyed this movie a lot. Great quality on Blueray
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The actors are excellent and performed movingly.  The suspense is also great and enticing.  Each personality was well played.  I can't wait to finish season 2 and move to 3
B004SDEP38|5.0|I love how easy it is to move documents between my PC and Kindle fire using Documents To Go. I run a golf league and I like how I can record the scores each week on my Kindle fire and then transfer the updated spreadsheets to my PC.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I found the second half more gripping and whereas I did enjoy this read I didn't find it a blockbusting page turner like most do
B00122V0D6|5.0|yes its a bad ass album when you wanna sit and smoke and trip, man........ love this freaking album and bought it yet again!
B005IQZB14|4.0|A fascinating book. I was surprised that Cheryl was so strongly affected by the death of her mother. It sent her all over the place both emotionally and geographically. Her hike kept you rooting for her. I knew she finished it but it was still suspenseful. This book is popular for a reason and I highly recommend it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Fun game. Like Mario but different. Great because it's free I would recommend this good for kids not very difficult
B004J4WKTW|4.0|The author captures the reader at once, creating mystery, magic and enticing characters all whirling through a plot created by two ghostly magicians. It is entertaining from its opening start to its elegant and surprising conclusion.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is a must have! Type in what you need you need and go there. Book mark feature is also great. If you enjoy reading about how Awesome your Lord and Savior are you are going to love this just like your paper version.
B005FHXB0O|5.0|such a good cast of stars such a great movie its a must see for anyone who hasn't seen it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The quality is quite good.  It helped me catch up to the current season three. It is an excellent product.
B002M3SOWO|5.0|My grandson loves Percy's books and was thrilled with this one and it fills out his collection and has already read it  twice.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of those can't-put-it-down books! Made me want to read more by this author, can recommend  Slammed and Point of Retreat.
1423140605|5.0|My Grandson loves to read and especially the fantasy books.  He is building quite a collection.  The produce was in great shape.
B006T5LGXA|4.0|What I like about it? It sounds great, it includes a pretty nice selection and it includes the entire concert... including drum solo which usually bands would exclude for some weird reason. The third MP3 item is added value, it's funny.<br /><br />What I dont like about it... no booklet?
B0041KVZ1I|5.0|Still love it!  My 20 year old son wanted it for the holidays and he was very happy with it too...
B009G7ZYUO|5.0|Everything I expected from a band the caliber of rage! Very pleased with this amazing product highly recommend this to all fans of r.a.t.m.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Everything about this season is full of win.  The prison, the new town, leading up to the rescue at the end of the season makes for some great suspenseful television.  And the zombies are better than ever.
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Picture quality was great..loved the story. I have seen this movie many times before, but watching this felt like a new movie
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I applaud the author in his efforts to give meaning to life and the Holocaust.  Anyone who has suffered anything, or feeling that there life is not meaningful enough, should read this book and give meaning to their suffering in writing.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Self indulgent,he needs an editor. I have read them all but the pace has slowed, if I have to read jape or kniickered again ill scream
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Another great Grisham novel.  I have read all of John Grisham books and while this isn't his best in my opinion, it definitely is a much read and ranks among his best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This whole trilogy is great and hard to put down once you start reading. I do not have a lot of time to read but every free second I had I found myself reading these books.
1451695195|4.0|I really liked this book.  I have read several books about Near Death Experiences and this one just seems a little more creditable since the author is a neurosurgeon and has to overcome his scientific background to believe what he experienced.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This whole trilogy is great and hard to put down once you start reading. I do not have a lot of time to read but every free second I had I found myself reading these books.
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I haven't played this much, but it seems like it will be fun and enjoyable.  Will have to continue to play to see if I totally like it or not.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This whole trilogy is great and hard to put down once you start reading. I do not have a lot of time to read but every free second I had I found myself reading these books.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As usual, the best book in a series is the first one and this is definitley true with this book and series.  I also enjoyed the book tremendously better than the movie.
B000FC1MOQ|4.0|I have only made it about half way through this book. I read it when I have time and so far it's not really a book that you have a hard time putting down.
B004SBX112|5.0|I love Angry birds and loved this version.  I can't seem to put it down sometimes as I am compelled to get 3 stars on each level.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|very long but a lot of information--characters come together too easily but well written and engrossing.  A very interestlng perspective on World  War II
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|I haven't played it much yet, but I don't like it so far.  Maybe I will like it better once I play it some more, but right now it is a dud for me.
B000U1ZVD0|3.0|While I like the film (that is why I purchased it), what I was sold was an HD DVD. I was sent a regular DVD by ExpressMedia.
B0094OLFUW|5.0|Wow. The xx really succeed in their sophomore album transcending the first album if possible. The sound & lyrics are a definite step up and lives up to the expectations.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I was a little concerned because the lyrics for Girl on Fire was a little remedial. The album as a whole is great! Love that she worked with Emile Sande on the writing....they make a great team. More to come I hope.
B005DOKM9M|3.0|I thought it would be just a little bit larger.  Fits very snug I have a nice one for my Kindle and I did not see it advertised when I bought the two I did.  I have a Vera Bradley for my Kindle Fire and I really like the size of it also.
0143118757|5.0|Excellent book!!! Helped a lot in construction industry where disputes is common!!<br />Also can help you with your crazy wife ;)
B006WAIV6M|3.0|This is an ok book. Some of the research referred to is interesting. Overly emphasises the role of habit I think. Very little devils advocate. I think there are better popular science books.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Every book until the 5th it's &#34;okay, maybe things work out&#34; and then &#34;nope&#34;.<br /><br />The twists were great and the continuity between all of the books held together really well. Although the characters aren't fleshed out much until we get to Juliet, the drama of finding out &#34;what's really going on&#34; with the Silos compensates for that. I'll be picking up the next book for sure.
1616550414|1.0|Waiting for an update from Nintendo. The content is there but the pages don't turn by swiping them, touchscreen and software are laggy, 1 star until these issues are resolved. Also where's Mario's historia? I must the timeline for Mario!!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is AWESOME.....and I think that its so awesome and shouldn't be free...I think that it should at least cost 2.99 or some the......kinda like temple run brave did when it came out......but yeah like the best game........EVER!!!!!###
1481251880|5.0|People, hear me when I say, this book NEEDS to be read!! Gah, the feelings I have for this book.<br />Just for your FYI... I really jumped into this book. Most times I dive into books not really knowing what they're about. If someone gives it an amazing review, then I am all in.  I devoured Hopeless in one sitting. Literally (well maybe not literally, but you get me). I COULD NOT put it down.<br /><br />Go, now, go purchase it. No really. Amazon has it for 3.99!!<br /><br />Happy reading to you all.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great story lines.  Gives a good idea of historically what was occurring during that time frame.  Great characters and plots.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|Just what I needed to protect my Kindle fire.<br />I wanted black so it doesn't get dirty easily.<br />I needed a basic cover
0545265355|5.0|Everything they said it would be.. extremely happy.. will definitely use them again!! I think if your a reader, you should too!!
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|It holds up beautifully, and is really a gem of a movie! Really led Clint Eastwood on his outstanding directorial journey.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love horses and this game makes me want one even more! Very good graphics and overall pretty fun :)
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|this was such a sweet heartwarming story.  it definitely was a tearjerker, but in the end it was so touching.  this is the kind of book that stays with you for a long time after you've finished reading it.  i recommend it to reader's of all ages.  great read aloud for 4th grade and up (definitely preread it though). i &#60;3 wonder
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I do not have a Kindle, but it is awesome that I can download Kindle apps for other devices and still access all the tremendous resources available from Amazon and the Kindle store.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|This is one sequel better then the original movie. This time, most of the action heros from the 80's and the 90's were in it. There is certain amount of humor. Action scenes are good.
B0078XHAB4|3.0|When Eilidh returns to her childhood village in Scotland you know that it is going to bring her the comfort that she needs to put her life back together. When she bumps into her childhood friend, Jamie McAnena, whose life is also not one hundred percent perfect, you suspect that they are going to get together.<br /><br />There were too many, and most unnecessary, perspectives. It would have been better to remain more focused on the two main characters which would have allowed for more suspense in the narrative.<br /><br />Overall the book was an enjoyable read.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Love Bruno Mars - what else is there to say!!!! Different fell from his first album and just as good.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game except you have to be at level 30 to be able to get the cooler animals and you have to buy peanuts when you run out
0307730697|5.0|I read and follow most of the books written by or about seals. This man got my utmost respect and admiration. My only regret is that I never met him. From the bottom to the top and with the respect of all his peers this man is awesome. Nothing more needs to be said
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Recommended to lots of friends.Have seen the autor of the book on tv show explaining what inspired her to write this book.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|My dad is a rancher who doesn't want for much - but last year we got him a blue-ray player & now I am able to get him some of his favorite movies to enjoy.  I was thrilled to see this classic in Blue-Ray & such a great price. Such a great series with a stellar cast!
B003A8N07Y|5.0|Good read. This book has already been rated, but just in case you missed it, BUY THIS BOOK FOR SOME FOOD FOR THOUGHT!
B0087YZBMS|5.0|Found the album unique to her voice, her passion shows through again. How she isnt an american star yet is beyond me.
0141888202|5.0|Gives you something to think about. Its not your ordinary book. Its a mind maze that will amaze. Buy it.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Love it is to use. Last had storms.  It was great to keep up with the way the storm was heading
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This was an easy read but a bit predictable.  Good for taking the mind off the day before going to bed.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|This app I love word well with kindle fire.  It is a good way to keep up. Is easy to use
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game it's so awesome if you don't have this game you need to get it its so cool.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics are so beautifully done in this game! This is by far the best horse app ever! I would recommend this to any horse lover.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Totally cool&hellip;better than all the other run games. would be great if there were short cuts through out the routes. some could be true short cuts and some could be fed ends.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This is the way it should have been done from the start.<br />Love how they stay true to the comic.<br />Karl Urban nailed it as Dredd.<br />Given all the material available to them, I can see several more movies coming...
B005BX3NAA|4.0|This is definitely a great compilation of GN'R hits and a few that many are not as familiar with. The reason I only give it four stars is because some songs are shortened to the radio mix and at least one track is slightly censored. Sweet Child O Mine is one that was shortened cutting out a good chunk of the intro. Ain't it Fun is the track that was slightly censored as well as Since I Don't Have You. Otherwise there are no complaints. I don't particularly like Sympathy For The Devil, but it's a nice song to have from Interview With The Vampire soundtrack.
B006HL9G10|5.0|I love it!  I use it everyday for my morning meditation and/or my home yoga practice session.  The tone of the bell is beautiful and helps center me.  I like the option of joining a cyber meditation community if I choose to.  It's the first time I've paid for an application on my smartphone and its worth it.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|its the rise of Master Chief, how could it not be bad. (But seriously it is a very good book to read if you're into HALO)
B0038ZITIE|5.0|Its a 80s movie and its a very good movie. I have always liked Sam Jones. He is a great actor.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|you type in numbers and it performs mathematical operations. To this date it has never been wrong. Honestly though, it is an easy to use app that works for us and it is free. I am pleased with it.
0783240287|5.0|I have been a fan of Donnie Osmond for a very long time. It has a good cast. loved it.
1400064627|5.0|I truly do absolutely love this book!  I have read it twice and watched the film three times.  It's such a favorite that I like to wait about a year and then read it again.  It's just as good, all over again, a book I can return to and enjoy for many years to come.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|This was my favorite movie when I was younger and I had never had it of my own...i recently went to a show to see it and my younger sister came with me and had never seen the actually movie so I purchased it and I love it.  Was in good condition and I love the shirt cover that it came in,
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is so much fun I find it very hard to put down and I just keep building wherever I go.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a though provoking quick read. I really enjoyed it. Loved learning about his experience through the lens of his medical background.
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|This game is very stupid. You get it thinking you are going to be able to pay games but each have costs money to play.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Short book and a quick read. It was very interesting to learn about the life, training and missions of the Seals. Plus it added to the story as portrayed in the movie Zero Dark 30. A great compliment.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A page turner, kept me guessing.  A really good read! I wanted to find out what happened next even after the story ended.
1401924751|5.0|They are so beautifully illustrated. Perhaps a little too thick for shuffling. I have a hard time to shuffle them. The instructions how to use are clear, easy to follow.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|I think the book represented true friendship, especially the ending. To shoot your friend is hard, but George comforted Penny and truly felt south for his death.
0316776963|1.0|Bought this book because 900 reviews suggested this book could be hilarious.  I found David Sedaris after reading all of Augusten Burroughs books (HIGHLY recommend!).  He was frequently compared to Sedaris.<br /><br />The difference being that Burroughs is actually funny and Sedaris is, quite simply, not.  In this book, the chapters are broken down into what are like mini-stories.  They don't even seem like they TRY to be funny.  You find yourself flipping page after page hoping that there will be some kind of redemption for the 15 pages you just read to find out that the conclusion is just as blatantly boring as the beginning and middle.<br /><br />It sucks that I spent $10 on a piece of literature I cannot and will not finish.  It should be like other products- returnable (I bought it in Kindle form.)<br /><br />Save your money and your brain cells- read Augusten Burroughs train-wreck literature if your looking for a humorous read.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so much fun. I can not get off it. And the best part is, it is FREE! So me, the pro reviewer says yes.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This is a good series that I was able to catch up on before the third season began.  Now, I am  with the current TV watching  fad.
B000FC0V3E|2.0|After reading \\"The Paris Wife,\\" I decided to read Hemingway's  \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"  I kept reading even though I found the dialog tedious and uninteresting.  Surely there will be something coming ahead that has made this book a classic I thought.  As it turned out, there was nothing ahead but more of the same.  If this is one of Hemingway's better novels, I won't be reading any others!  Don't waste your time on this one unless you want to read a bunch of empty dialog between shallow, selfish, and soulless individuals who don't learn anything but how to continue on their own destructive paths while inflicting harm on others.  However no one dies or is severely injured, because that would be too memorable or interesting for this book.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Nice game with excellent graphics and intriguing gameplay. I love all big fish adventure games and games with a long and thorough story line. The fact that the first person view point was from a woman really made it good. Being a girl myself I strive to find girl point of view games.
B005QI4TP8|1.0|God knows why this was well rated. Depressing. Listened to it 4 times trying to understand appeal. Never got it. Disappointment.
B007SGM084|5.0|Wow, I didn't expect that!  I'm still reading the first part but I can tell you I was shocked and surprised even at the beginning of the first book.  I can't wait to read all three!  It is really hard to put down, want to see what happens next.  Wish I could tell you more but the story is full of twists and turns that make it a must read.

B006JD48NM|5.0|What a great movie. My dad is into Formula 1 so I decided to watch it and I as very touched and also inspired.<br />In racing, nothing is promised. There are no guarantees. There are ups and downs. I used to run track and was able to relate in some way. I was touched by his life and the man that he was. It ended in a sad way but I wasn't too sad because that is how life is. It's unpredictable and just because you expect things to happen, doesn't mean they will happen.<br />I think Ayrton Senna left a great legacy and a standard for others. I loved that did not \\"schuck and jive\\" for anyone.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|At first I thought this book was going to be a teenage romance with a lot of teen sex.  However, as the story evolved it became more interesting and focused more on the adoption of the main character.  I don't want to give it away, but as the story unfolded, there were some interesting twists that kept me reading.  I liked it.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|First of all, I love Nicholas Sparks' books.  This was another good one.  A young girl escapes the abuse & control her policeman husband has over her.  She flees to a small town where no one will know her, and she uses a new identity.  She meets a young father of 2, and they have an immediate interest in each other.  Little by little, they fall in love.  Her husband is a detective, so he eventually tracks her down.  What he does to get his revenge is very riveting.  I couldn't put the book down, but at the same time, I hated for it to end.  This is definitely a good book.

B009YP9L7U|3.0|What started out as a night of a few drinks with friends, ends with Megan married to a Connor. And, to make an awkward situation worse, she doesn't remember anything when she wakes up in his bed the next morning. What Megan quickly catagorizes as a mistake, Connor isn't so quick to agree. So he sets out to convince her otherwise...<br /><br />It was a decent, short romance read. Good chemistry (especially that first morning after) but maybe a little too over the top for me at times. I guess Connor - while still likable - lost some of this attractiveness to me because he was trying too hard at times.<br /><br />I received this ebook from Netgalley in exchange for a honest review.

The portable battery supply to the bluetooth headset is just wonderful. Can leave one in the bag and one in the office for re-charging the bluetooth headset when it runs low in battery power.

B005LAII8K|4.0|\\"Looper\\" is a violent but rewarding action movie that delves into the mental conundrum of time travel, enjoys the mental crisis it creates, then backs off just far enough so that it's an enjoyable couple of hours. It's a heady flick that asks several questions of the viewer, especially: Would you kill your past or future self off if it meant protecting someone you love?<br /><br />\\"Looper\\" stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt , Bruce Willis, and Emily Blunt, and is directed by Rian Johnson, a relative newcomer whose claim to fame is 2005's neat little oddball film Brick [HD], which he also wrote and directed. Interestingly enough, it also starred Gordon-Levitt.<br /><br />This time around, Rian Johnson offers us a clever take on futuristic action films, and \\"Looper\\" by and large succeeds, offering Willis in a somewhat typical role of a rough-and-tumble killer, but this time he has a sentimental side. He's been brought back from the future to be murdered (called \\"Closing the Loop\\" for reasons I'll explain in the next paragraph), and he hopes his actions here, in HIS past, might save the woman he loves in his PREVIOUS present (NOW and forevermore his future).<br /><br />You see, Willis plays Joe, whose younger self (played by Gordon-Levitt) is a unique kind of assassin. Thirty years from the movie's \\"present\\" (it's set in 2044, so ITS future is 2074), digital IDs make murder next to impossible, so organized crime bosses who want people knocked off have to send them back in time with hands tied and hoods on their heads, where they are immediately shot dead and their bodies incinerated. However, something new is going on in the future, and a new crime boss (called \\"the Rainmaker\\") is bent on consolidating power by killing the KILLERS themselves through capturing them, sending them back, and having the killers kill THEMSELVES, thus \\"Closing the Loop\\"--get it?<br /><br />But Willis, whom I'll call Future Joe for clarity's sake, is smart (of course), and he outwits Present Joe and escapes. What happens is too complex to fully explain here, but suffice it to say that not only does Present Joe have a lot of trouble killing Future Joe, but Future Joe's reasons for staying alive are beginning to make sense to Present Joe. Worse yet, the longer Future Joe is on the loose, the more trouble Present Joe has staying free and alive; as the killer who messed up his assassination, things are getting a bit sticky for him.<br /><br />Emily Blunt comes into play as a single mother who lives by the side of a huge corn field into which Present Joe has escaped, and she reluctantly takes him in to protect him. While she warns her son to steer clear of him, Present Joe has begun to take an interest in the boy's significance, and he realizes he may need to stick around to protect him from his future self.<br /><br />NOTE: leaving out an entire sub-plot which, if I were to include it, would tell you too much about the movie. Suffice it to say the movie is a bit more complex than I've presented it here, but a clear head should be able to follow it. It's no Inception, clarity-wise, but there are some definite brain-teasers, surprises and plot twists here, and director (and writer) Johnson deserves credit for making a clever movie that asks action-ers to think as they watch.<br /><br />An interesting side-note: some might be thrown off by Gordon-Levitt's \\"alterations,\\" facially...however it was done, G-L looks a lot LIKE a younger Willis, and there are some who might find that off-putting, the kind of thing that causes them to focus on the changes and let it interfere with their enjoyment of the movie. (I mention this because some reviewers HAVE mentioned it.)<br /><br />While Willis, G-L, and Blunt all handle their roles well, one character I enjoyed watching was Jeff Daniels as Abe, a \\"present\\" day crime boss who's actually been imported from the future so that he can better fathom and take charge of the events that transpire. Rather than portraying the typical power-hungry mobster boss, Daniels plays the role with a calm intelligence that adds an interesting element to his leadership.<br /><br />When another assassin screws up his own Closing of the Loop, slightly ahead of G-L's and Willis' dilemma, Abe resists those who are falling all over themselves in order to handling it. Instead, as the narrative switches to the man who should have been assassinated, we slowly witness him \\"coming apart\\": first he notices one finger is missing, then another, and on and on. It's then we realize that Abe has grabbed the present day assassin and, to force the future version to turn himself in, he has begun CHOPPING. Realizing what's at stake, the future criminal can't turn himself in fast enough...literally. Suffice it to say the sequence is pretty ugly...<br /><br />There are other clever tricks played with the time factor, and it makes for an entertaining--though occasionally violent--movie.<br /><br />If you like a good Bruce Willis movie you should enjoy this one: it's a smart movie full of action, drama, and possesses a compelling storyline. You need to keep sharp while watching, but you don't need to master the space-time continuum. Just sit back and enjoy yourself: \\"Looper\\" should provide you with a pleasant couple of hours.r-hungry mobster boss, Daniels plays the role with a calm intelligence that adds an interesting element to his leadership.<br /><br />When another assassin screws up his own Closing of the Loop, slightly ahead of G-L's and Willis' dilemma, Abe resists those who are falling all over themselves in order to handling it.

B006R4H5FG|5.0|I did lot of presentation slides in my life. But i kind of lacked with my slides and contents. I mean, design and other things was not that appropriate.

B008B9JSKU|4.0|Here comes something a little unexpected in the dawning weeks of the Summer blockbuster season, it's an old school action-thriller with a film noir soul, the kind of movie in the hard manned style that a few decades earlier could have easily starred screen greats like Lee Marvin or Steve McQueen. Playing just a few screens away from superheroes, aliens, and water logged battleships is this, a movie relying on acting, emotion, thought, empathy and good old fashion butt kicking. However, don't let me sell you a bottle of snake oil, The Samaritan is the kind of movie where the sum of it's parts are better than it is as a whole, but it does offer some juicy cuts.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson, in one of his best roles in ages, stars as Foley, a former grifter just being released from prison after serving a twenty-five year stretch. With no intent of ever going back, however old troubles from his past come looking for him in the form of Ethan (Luke Kirby).  Ethan is the son of Foley's former partner, whom Foley killed in sucoomanstances that bear special consideration. Not looking for revenge, exactly, but wanting Foley to join him in a confidence scheme. Foley refuses in hopes of starting his life anew.<br /><br />Enter Iris (Ruth Negga), a angel with a femme fatale body,  who befriends Foley after he comes to her aid as a good Samaritan with a bad attitude. The wounded old dog and his anguished young paladin, a drug addict and sometimes prostitute, find a real kinship and love for each other. However, like all good things in the movies, it wasn't meant to last. Ethan, and his boss, a merciless gangster named Xavier (Tom Wilkinson) pull Foley back into the life, now that they've found leverage that wont allow him to back out.<br /><br />The story is told pretty straight forward, devoid of the expected convoluted twists and turn. This works both in it's favor and against it's self at the same time, it's refreshing to not be in the realm of the ludicrous, but it does makethe proceedings seem fairly obvious, but never stagnant.  It's lack of complexity helps to keep it in the style of  the genre's triumphs of the distant past, in some ways it reminds me of last years undervalued and little seen Michael Caine old school vigilante flick Harry Brown.<br /><br />This Canadian made movie is directed by David Weaver, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Elan Mastai,  Weaver has mostly worked in Canadian television up to this point, but he shows real promise as a film director, he has a keen eye for detail. The script isn't the greatest, it could have used an infusion of snappy dialogue and the resolution is a little too tidy and forced, still there are a few good tender scenes written in for Foley and Iris, well played by the actors. Good production values, enhanced by fine looking cinematography by Francois Pagenais keep the low budgeted film from ever appearing as such.<br /><br />The casting is very good, I can't remember the last time that Jackson was this good on screen, he served as one of the executive producers on the film, so his belief in the material is evident. After a few years of forgettable, mostly unseen films, some of them actually going directly to DVD, he know seems to be back on track.  Alongside his scene stealing role in The Avengers and a well received turn on Broadway as Martin Luther King, Jr., I hope that this is nothing less than the redemption of Sam Jackson.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson, the wonderful British character actor who can also be seen in theaters right now in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel, steals his few, but delightful scenes. He has a real menace, laced with strychnine charm and a hint of Hannibal Lector in his voice. Newcomer Ruth Negga is also very good as Iris, an Irish born actress I learned, but you would never guess it here, her Canadian accent is flawless. I  have not seen her before, but she makes an immediate impression. The weakest link in the cast is another new face, Luke Kirby in the pivotal role of Ethan, he's too banal and farcically self confident to ever make the role his own. You can't believe this guy as hoodlum working for Wilkinson's Xavier, he would chew him up and spit him out before the opening titles finished.<br /><br /> So if big bangs and special effects got you down, and your not exactly looking for art house fare, but rather something a little grittier this could be the answer, at least until Savages opens. Fans of old school killing and action stars, will welcome this, as there seems to be few genuine tough guys out there anymore; welcome home, Mr. Jackson.<br /><br />check out m reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B0085A9HXS|4.0|Welsh born writer-director Gareth Evans has taken cinema to a new level with his latest movie the Raid: Redemption, and that is that he has successfully translated film into the realm of video game. Let me explain, the Raid: Redemption tells the story of an Indonesian S.W.A.T. team that lays siege on a corrupt apartment building housing various low lives and criminals. The story progresses as the heroes go floor by floor battling it out with their nemesis.<br /><br />Now, I know that this doesn't sound like very much, and what it does sound like doesn't exactly sound good. The real surprising thing is, that it is good, very good. This movie lives up to the term, it moves, and it moves rapidly. Through a keen lens director Evans, who also did the film's exhausting editing, keeps the action and the pace at a breakneck speed utilizing expert cinematography from Matt Flannery, everything is clear and focused in a jaw dropping visual style that it makes it difficult to blink.<br /><br />Played out over loud rock music, the picture barely has time for character introduction let alone development. This could have hampered the film, but everything is going so fast that it would be wrong to slow it down. there is a lead protagonist, portrayed by star of Evans previous movie Merantau, Iko Uwais, who also choreographed the film's incredible action scenes. He is reduced to easily expectable clich&eacute;s (pregnant wife, conflict with brother on the wrong side of the battle) that is more inline with caricature.<br /><br />The whole bloody affair comes across like an easily digestible cross between the Warriors and John Carpenter's Assault on Percent 13. Which is all right by me because the movie remembers the first rule of filmmaking and that is to make it cinematic. This could not have been a novel, even the script must have been a poor read, but it will appeal to fans of first person shooter games and martial arts pictures. If I fall into any category it would be the latter, if you fear you may not enjoy the film because your no gamer, well take it from me, you've got nothing to worry about. I am no gamer myself, I all, but detest the idea of wasting my time for hours on end feeding a machine my valuable life expectancy for a tedious fruitless exercise. This movie is more rewarding than any game, only just as much fun.<br /><br />check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.comfear you may not enjoy the film because your no gamer, well take it from me, you've got nothing to worry about.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Thus game us a very fun game that you can build a city and run vehicles in. You manage money also.
B005Y1B3Q0|4.0|Released exclusively on Blu-ray, like Stallone's previous director's edition of his last (John) Rambo film. Any paying patron will pretty much know what to expect from the movie itself, having most likely already seen the previously released theatrical cut. So, the question to be answered is how does this version differ and is it worth the extra dough to add to one's collection.<br /><br />Assembling an impressive cast of veteran tough guys and action stars, Sly Stallone co-wrote, directed and stars alongside Jason Stahtam, Jet Li, Mickey Rourke, Dolph Lundgren, Eric Roberts, Randy Couture, \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin,  Gary Daniels, Terry Crews, and with cameos from the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. This is a big, dumb movie of the highest order, who could ask for anything more. Arcing back to the days when action flicks were about brute force, well trained stuntmen and correctly timed charges. None of this nancy boy CGI wire effects that can turn even the meekest of movie stars into a superhero. Don't worry about plot, all we need is just enough dialogue to get us from one gun battle to the next.<br /><br />As it is, I enjoyed the theatrical version when I saw when it was first released a couple of years ago in a throwback to the days of my boyhood when I greatly anticipated each and every new film from these stars. The new extended cut is according to Sly himself in an introduction before the movie \\"better than the theatrical, has more content, more heart and is closer to it's original intent.\\" Okay, I don't know about all that, but what I can tell you is that this version is longer, cooler, more violent and makes better use of music. Still, the rough edges of a rush production are as evident as before.<br /><br />We see, or rather hear the new additions right up front with a giddily corny voice over introduction by Stallone's Barney Ross character that does nothing for the flick. However, we quickly get an extended action scene. There is far more humor to this version, I loved all the talk of Lundgren's Viking beliefs and funerals, and Sly and the Stath are awarded more amiable banter. Couture and Crews, who were short changed in the theatrical release, here get at least a little more screen time,  character development and more full monologues. There are a few additional dramatic moments offered to Statham and love interest Charisma Carpenter, that like dramatic scenes from earlier Stallone directed films comes across awkward with wobbly performances. And yes, more action. The best addition pervaded here is the use of music, from the different opening titles unfolding over Sully Erna (of Godsmack)'s moody \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" to the successful inclusion of Shinedown's \\"Diamond Eyes\\", so popular in the movie's trailer, played over the final showdown sequence.<br /><br />A significant improvement, I would actually say. A more fully rounded, fun and entertaining adventure film. The Blu-ray has a bunch of cool bonus features, the best being the feature length documentary Inferno: the Making of the Expendables, that is well worth checking out.<br /><br />check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Fantastic read I really enjoyed the dramatic twists and details  overall great book I will defiantly read the series good job Suzanne :)
B009MF5BXK|4.0|\\"I'm back\\" declares Arnold Schwarzenegger mid-way through the Expendables 2 and for a lot of people that is music to their ears. Action stars of the past galore unite to do what they do best, kick butt and look damnably cool while doing. Could you ask for anything more, well a better question is would you ask for anything more of a movie like the Expendables 2. If your answer is a fist in the air defiant rebel yell of HELL NO!, then  you are the right audience for this movie.<br /><br />A lot of people will not enjoy the Expendables 2, you know who you are and if your reading this, you probably shouldn't be. I admit with only marginal embarrassment to be an unabashed enthusiast of this sort of old school entertainment, I was born at the tail end of the 70's and grew up in the VHS era that was dominated by mindless actioners from the big muscled, big gun totting, ass whopping tough guys of ol' with names like Arnold, Sly, Chuck, Bruce, Dolph, Jean-Claude, and they all have assembled here for what could have been an embarrassing 21st century variation of \\"the over the Hill Gang\\", instead it is a sort of middle age and beyond version of the Avengers, only it's live action.<br /><br />The story isn't much, just enough to get the guys from one big bang to another big boom. The expendables are a team of mercenaries who are recruited for a new mission by their friendly nemesis Mr. Church (Bruce Willis), who is hanging a prison sentence over their head based around their exploits from the previous film. So team leader Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) reunites his guys, including Lee Christmas (Jason Statham),  Gunnar Jenson (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hail Caesar (Terry Crews), to lead them into certain danger to retrieve a none too well defined package.<br /><br />Another group, these ones of  badies lead by super villain named Villain, say it with a French ascent, played by the mussels from Brussels himself, Jean-Claude Van Damme also want the devise.This results in the death of the team's youngest member, Billy Timmons (Liam Hemsworth), just before his retirement and eminent settling down.<br /><br />Now, Barney and his team engage in what one character refers to as \\"male patterned badness\\" to find the bad guys and extract a little sweet revenge. They also need to carry out their original mission, I suppose, but that all takes a back set to their retribution. Joined by wondering mercs Booker (Chuck Norris) and Trench (Schwarzenegger), the boys are good to go. They don't draw first blood, but they die hard and terminate with extreme prejudice.<br /><br />The movie is something of an improvement over it's well liked, but unloved predecessor for a number of reasons. Not that it has any more depth or live affirming sentiments, who needs them. This flick is an apologetic testosterone fuelled macho bullcrap at it's zenith. It is also a whole lot of fun to watch, the cast is game and enjoying every minute of it. The script is full of  silly in-jokes, cheeky humor and hilariously bad dialogue. It's more fun than the first film and has a lighter tone. It moves at a rapid fire pace that doesn't allow the audience's attention to wander far. It's also not just purely a bloodfest, in fact the on screen bloodletting is kept to a minim in the name of good taste, but works as a rousing adventure tail too. So often action pictures forget that they belong to the larger genre heading of action/adventure.<br /><br />Stallone does look old here, though, and more tired than ever before. He still has star power and uses it well to over come some obvious hurdles. His final showdown with martial arts superstar Van Damme is a worthy addition to his cannon of action scenes in cinema history. Likewise Statham and rising action star Scott Adkins gets a nice, but too brief martial arts duel.<br /><br />The charismatic Lundgren is allowed to have a more expanded role than in the first movie that showcase a surprising talent for comic relief.Schwarzenegger. Willis and Norris have fun with their glorified cameos that allow them to kid their famous screen images.  Couture and  Crews just seem to be filling space, even more so than before. And Jet Li has nothing more than a brief appearnace in the picture's opening, although so much goes on so quickly that you may not even notice his absence. Hemsworth is an ill choice, his role is underwritten and cliché, and he looks out of place.<br /><br />The film is unapologetically nostalgic for it's by gone era, CGI is still kept to a minim, the boys do as much of the action as their tired old bodies will allow. The action scenes and the stunts are on par with the best the genre has to offer. Directed by Simon West, who has proven himself a truly capable director of old school action flicks with credits like Con Air and the Statham starrer the Mechanic redux. He gives the film a nice flair, pace and affectionate feel. It is all silly absurd goodness, it knows and reveals in it. Unfortunately, like too many action flicks these days it is shot in grey and gloomy Eastern Europe, unless I was mistaken and that was Detroit.<br /><br />Willis says of the exploits \\"a little extreme, but nice.\\" I think that this is a sentiment shared by the enthusiastic audience awaiting this movie. There aren't very many like this any more, and there won't be again.  A relic of another time, if not a kinder and gentler one. Sly also comments about a plane looking like it belongs in a museum, to which Arnold retorts \\"don't we all.\\" If they are not exactly national treasures, at least they are iconic legends of what they do, and let's hope they keep doing it as long as medicare covers their injuries.<br /><br />check out my reviews at reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
1451620829|3.0|Coming from a musician and drummer no less, I was hoping for more insight into the musicality behind Kiss. Mr. Criss is an over-comer to say the least. He is certainly telling his story from his perspective and he is entitled to his own opinion. I'm not sure what the purpose of the book is. Mr. Criss doesn't give any big revelations. He doesn't unburden himself of dark secretes, he barely takes responsibility for anything. Maybe it a way to make money, must have worked, I bought it.
B00AG51RU6|1.0|You know a thriller is in serious trouble when the picteure-esque scenery is far more enthralling than the action scenes on screen. So goes the generic espionage potboiler the Cold Light of Day. The latest showcase for would-be British leading man Henry Cavill, that will leave you thinking to yourself that this guy will be forgotten, once...wait, what was his name again.<br /> Cavill, if you don't already know, will be seen next summer as the man of steel, so this vehicle, along with last year's lackluster Immortals are to familiarize audiences with him. You know kind of the way that the Recruit and Daredevil stalled the once promising career of Collin Farrell. Here, Cavill stars as Will Shaw, a man of anything but steel, on a week long boating vacation with a family that he seems to despise. When wouldn't you know it, mom (Caroline Goodall) and little brother Josh (Rafi Gaven) along with his girlfriend (Emma Hamilton) are all abducted by an unseen terrorist group. Pops (Bruce Willis) comes clean to Will about his real day job, he's not a cultural attaché, but a CIA operative, so there plan seems to be to get some quality father-son bonding time in while getting the fam back.<br /> This movie is as ludicrous as it sounds, and strangely enough it sounds to me just like an ancient Gen Hackman-Matt Dillon flick called Target. The narrative is obvious, far-fetched and mindless in a way that will make your head hurt and your brain angry.<br />This all plays out as a sort of Taken, Jr., or maybe it's aim is as a cross between the Bourne films and the Spy Kids movies.<br /> At least the picture is set in a lovely Spain setting instead of Bulgaria or Yugoslavia, like so many actioners these days. The cinematography by Remi Andefarsijn, who also shot the gorgeous looking HBO mini-series Band of Brothers and  the Pacific, is something short of wonderful. Anderfarsjin manages to make the Cold Light of Day the best looking action movie I can remember this year, it's just sucha damn shame that it is in the service of one of the most pedestrian.<br /> Directed by Mabrouk El Mechri, who's previous film was the critically esteemed JCVD. I didn't like that movie very much as I felt it reduced it's star and subject, action icon Jean-Claude Van Damme, to a whiney, self-loathing and an utterly embarrassing joke. Audiences seemed to know better and stayed away, I wrote at the time of it's release  that the same people who liked this film, were the same people who didn't like any of Van Damme's other movies. Now El Mechri has returned with another obnoxious movie with even more poorly staged action scenes, car chases, plot twists you'll see before you walk through the theater door and bland heroes. Action movies clearly are not his forte, and based on this evidence I would say that El Mechri has a distain for the genre, but I`m also not sure he has the skill or style for anything else. It almost seems like a curse, the one thing he has talent for he despises.<br /> Bruce Willis at least makes getting old look good, actually he manages to make it look cool, settling in quite well these days playing an older version of his well liked screen persona. Here, almighty Bruce gets to show he is still in full command of his bad assery, even more so than in recent titles like the Expendables 2 and the over hyped Red. However, he is not the star here, no matter what the marketing tries to lead you to believe, in fact he makes a none too unexpected, but no less unsatisfactory early exit. Leaving the picture in the hands of Cavill.<br /> Cavill is an intense, serious looking presence, with chiseled features and an action hero's physique, all that he is missing is charisma. Which is something no action star can do without, as we've seen before, actually acting chops are far more optional. As a leading man, he is just too colorless and prosaic, let's hope that things get better for him before sporting Superman`s cape. He makes a uninteresting film move at an even more lumbering pace.<br /> Sigourney Weaver, a class act and legendary movie star, is at her worst I have ever seen or even thought I would see from such a veteran talent,  Giving an entirely unconvincing performance  playing Jean Carrack, Willis' former partner, for the first half of the movie it's a badly kept secret that she's actually the villain. Part of the reason it is so badly kept is that Weaver plays the role as a villain from the get go. It's not that's she not a believable villain, she mostly plays villains these days, and it is certainty not that she can't pull off action roles. It is just such a badly written role that she has no idea what to do with it, she is saddled with some of the movie's worst dialogue, but also gets it's biggest laughs.  Then before it is all over, Weaver manages to morph into an unstoppable terminatrax.<br /> The seemingly endless car chases are at least givinen a little spunk by Valerio Bonelli's crisp editing which at least has trepidation if not suspense or successful audience involvement. Likewise Lucas Vidal's score does more to highlight the movie's lack of tension than to underline it.<br /> This kind of trite will only appeal to the least discriminating of action movie spectators, like last year's turkey Killer Elite. This one lacks the exhilarating spirit of earlier, much beloved action adventures, it's tedious and horribly boring too boot. This all goes on for what seems like hours, but in all actuality is just over ninety minutes. Once Willis exits the movie, at about the twenty or thirty minute mark, however, many viewers will find little to further their interest. If the Cold Light of Day proves anything it's that Cavill is no substitute for Bruce Willis.<br /><br />check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The graphics in this game are awesome. I absolutely loved this game way more than the old Temple Run<br />Other than that this game is one of my new favorites.
B008NA3HZ4|3.0|Following the success, warm reviews and award accolades galore for her debut feature Away From Her, actress Sarah Polley has return with her second feature as writer and director. While not a masterpiece like her earlier triumph, Take This Waltz still manages to have enough interest and ambition to make it a worthy, if not a remarkable follow up. The outer crust is rich, but I suspect the inside to be hollow. Which comes as something of a shame, but I think Polley will continue to grow as a filmmaker and should defiantly remain on everyone's radar.<br /><br />Set in Polley's native Toronto, and following Margot (Michelle Williams) and Lou (Seth Rogen), a young married couple old before their time. She, a bored wife writing tedious travel brochures, he a would-be chief working on a thriller of a book regarding the many ways to prepare a chicken dinner. Margot has a chance meeting with a handsome stranger (Luke Kirby) while on assignment, a meet cute that follows her onto the airplane trip back home ,and grows all the more awkward when they realize that they are close neighbors. He is Daniel and he leads a more carefree existence that easily attracts the attention, but more slowly is the affections of Margot. Not wanting a full blown love affair to bloom, Margot still finds herself being drawn to the more adventures and relaxed Daniel. Meanwhile Lou remains tamely unaware, with a further conflict developing involving his alcoholic sister, Geraldine (Sarah Silverman).<br /><br />Polley is a fine actress who hasn't always landed the plum juicy roles that she deserves, in fact it surprises me more than a little that she hasn't cast herself in any of the strong roles in one of her own films, yet. She is also a first rate director, one who understands how to direct actors, that was keenly evident in her debut feature, there is still a difference of opinion over weather Julie Christie was robbed of an Oscar win or not, but is even more so here.  This movie succeeds in spitof it's pretensions and often lumbering plotting thanks to the excellent performances.<br /><br />Michelle Williams is adorable as always, smart and assured playing the sort of character she's becoming a specialist in, I suspect that a lot of people will recall Blue Valentine when watching this film. The real kudos, though, must go to Seth Rogen, who is nicely cast against type, in a role that will seem familiar to many people. His Lou has done nothing wrong, he's just an observer in his own life story. The tenderness and sadness that Rogen brings to the role helps to show something I have seen before in the actor, but has largley been left neglected and that is that he's actually a pretty good actor. Also well cast is comedian Sarah Silverman who has finally found a film role worthy of her talent.<br /><br />The movie is also highlighted by a nifty soundtrack featuring a lott of indie rock and alternative music. Which should come as little surprise as the film was inspired by the moody song of the same name by legendary Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, it is not as richly texture or as poetic as the song. The movie is also unfortunately lacking in the wit that can often be found in so much of Cohen's beautiful and deeply felt music. A cool place to find inspiration for a film though, see what I mean about the keen insight that Polley brings to her films.<br /><br />The frustrations and boredom in Margot's life is the centerpiece of the movie, told in such a low key way, to the point of banality, which probably is the point. It leaves the events of the picture to unfold a little on the stodgy side. At almost two hours it is a little long as well, a censored version released  in Canada runs 91 minutes, one must wonder if that versions play better.<br /><br />Take This Waltz resembles nothing more than a big budgeted mumble core movie, you know those films that are famously underwritten and developed with amateur performances and dialogue thought up on the fly, but with everyone having sex and getting naked at the drop of a hat. The sex is toned down, and Polley's script is better than that,  but the characterizations are certainty more facile. There's often not enough to sustain a real interest here, but the emotional content is strong particularly towards the ending confrontations, most of which unfold to the contraire of expectations.<br /><br />An uneven film for sure dealing with issues familiar to the indie drama crowd, Take This Waltz fails to avoid cliché. I have already mentioned Williams' Oscar nominated triumph in the superb Blue Valentine, which I'm sure that this will conjure up memories of that admittedly superior film. Polley's film lacks the deep perspective of that film which helped to make it so afflicting and memorable. However, the cast rises above the material, and Polley has left her script rich enough for them to find something to say even when they have nothing left to speak of. This is the ultimate success of this small, but thoughtful enough film.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com
1567184855|5.0|Fascinating to ponder what it might be like on &#34;the other side&#34;. Enjoyed the case study format. Very easy reading if this is your interest. It kept me going and wanting more, so I read two of his other books.
B005LAIIQC|4.0|Jeremy Reinner jumps head first into this reboot of the Bourne Identity franchise, not as Jason Bourne, but as a reasonable surrogate hero. An expansion of the Bourne universe, according to the press release, this fourth entry offers more of the same with equal amounts of pizzazz and thrills. It`s a winning formula, and if it aint broke. Hollywood aint gonna fix it.<br /> Taking place nearly concurrent with the franchise's previous entry, the Bourne Ultimatum, this time out we follow the exploits of Aaron Cross (Renner). Cross was a part of different black ops called Outcome, but when the Bourne scandal (now there's an interesting unused title) is broke to the press, Treadstone decides to cover their tracks by eliminating all Outcome agents as well. The Outcome agents are genetically enhanced super soldiers, Cross is the only one to escape with his life, but is in need of his stabilizing meds. This leads him to seek out Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz), who was in charge of the research program, and he finds her in just the nick of time as she about to have her government contract terminated for good. The two have to rely on one another to survive and escape those who are now hunting them.<br /> The story is as complicated as any other Bourne adventure, and yet somehow easier to follow and more straightforward. This is not necessarily an asset as a lot of the mystery seems to have been let go in favor of even more stunts and shoot outs. The movie does keep viewers tense and on the edge of their seats for the entirety of this fast moving thriller. Even at two hours and fifteen minutes, it feels brisk and is over before you know it. The pacing is so taunt that it's effortless in it's ability to disguise it's failings.<br /> The breakneck final chase scene, on motorcycles no less through Manila, in particular is one of the best you'll see all year. It's pulsating, suspenseful and exhilarating to the max. It will make the heart beat fast and the blood pressure sore. Finely done and a stirring achievement thanks to the dp Robert Elswit and editor John Gilroy`s fancy know how. The action scenes are the usual quick cuts to help A-list stars look like athletes, but at least the shaky cam is kept to a minimum this time.<br /> Renner is a thoroughly acceptable substitute for franchise regular Matt Damon. Damon's Jason Bourne is still very much a presence in the film, with many photographs of the actor seen through out, as well so much of the plot hinging on his whereabouts and as the title suggest, his legacy. Renner, who's become well known of late in supporting roles, makes a smooth transition to leading man. I would happily see future adventures starring the talented actor since Damon has in recent interviews hinted at the unlikeness of his returning  to the role.<br /> Weisz also is in fine form here playing a tough and smart role. Her Dr. Shearing, while not an action hero, is no damsel in distress, either. Weisz is too smart to play stupid roles anymore, she was fantastic and Oscar snubbed in a film last year titled the Whistleblower and notice the way she ditched the histrionically awful Mummy  franchise as soon as she won an Academy Award. She is a top flight actress, beautiful and a wonderful screen presence, I hope they don't make the same mistake as they did earlier with Frank Potente and keep Weisz a integral part of this new series incarnation.<br /> I've said before that any good thriller depends on the strength of it's villains and keeping with the Bourne formula of excellent character actors playing well written, sneering antagonists this time around we get Edward Norton and Stacy Keach. These two fine actors are enthralling enough to watch in their own right that the only logical complaint could be that we spend too much time focusing on the heroes in this movie. Also as a bonus many of the series past stars, including Joan Allen, David Strathairn, Scott Glenn and Albert Finney, pop up in welcome cameos.<br /> Directedby Tony Gilroy, taking over from franchise helmer Paul Greengrass, Gilroy is a capable director who has showed moments of greatness. His inspired first film was Michael Clayton, one of the best movies of 2007. Gilroy misstepped somewhat with his second picture the over inflated Julia Roberts-Clive Owen vehicle Duplicity. The Bourne Legacy not only gets Gilroy back on track, but has moments that once more hint at the tremendous potential that lie within.<br /> Gilroy has had a hand in writing the other three Jason Bourne adventures, so it seemed a natural choice for the budding auteur to take the helm. Co-writing this time with his brother, Dan, Gilroy has turned out another adequate workman like script. They keep the proceedings at a steady pace and make Cross an acceptable replacement for the familiar Bourne, a similar cross between James Bond and Harry Palmer. Once again the film raises more questions than it answers, and adds nothing predominantly new to the franchise, it would appear to just lead us into the next series installment but it knows what it is doing and it does it well. This also ranks as the second best man vs. wolf movie of 2012.<br /> This entry works just fine, unfortunately that's it and really nothing more. Still, it delivers the goods and fans and novices of the series alike should get their money's worth as long as they aren't expecting too much. The biggest question that may be raise is just how long can this franchise keep on going singing the same old song and audiences will keep on attentively listening.<br /><br />Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B0058YPGL6|5.0|This is an awesome series. Very well written. You really feel what the characters are going through just trying to grow up.
B004OEIL5O|3.0|I went into this Scream movie with low expectations as I knew going in this is generally considered to be the worst, and after seeing the movie and learning of its troubled, different and fast production I'm not surprised. While this movie does include the majority of stuff from the others and makes homoages to them by tieing them together and setting the stage for the ending, it doesn't fully succed and supports the cliche (proven just as much as it isn't) that the third act is usually the worst.<br /><br />Before I go on, I did enjoy the movie, it felt intense in some areas, it did follow the rules pattern, I was glad with how the storylines ended but I have more complaints then likes for this film. See the movie first.<br /><br />The movie does try to be good by giving a very surprising beginning, moving each character's storylines along in good ways, throwing in humor. giving Randy one more rules segment, adding new people and giving them much focus, more outside reactions to the groups perils, doing the new backstory later film installments do and revealing a big mastermind killer.<br /><br />However many of these dont' work or are actually what hurts the movie. The focus on newer characters trying to track down the mastermind killer, hurts the movie as less time is spent on the three main people, Sidney espically as she is really a supporting character in this movie, who really is only there to get in trouble. The humor is more about people being patheitic, rather then well done humor. The tone of the movie feels different as the LA setting makes the movie feel more alien. The killing of Randy is actually made worse in this movie as it is revealed he dies because of breaking one of the rules.<br /><br />Personal dislikes were that the killer was actually just one person, his identity came out of nowhere (let's make him the killer and not make it believable). Also this killer is back to stumbling into everything it's path which I don't like. Finally this killer didn't feel completly menacing lots of the time once his identity was revealed, annoying.<br /><br />So it was nice to watch but is without question the worst one in the franchise and I'm glad it wasn't the last as, thankfully, this horror franchise managed to redeam itself and stay that way.didn't feel completly menacing lots of the time once his identity was revealed, annoying.<br /><br />So it was nice to watch but is without question the worst one in the franchise and I'm glad it wasn't the last as, thankfully, this horror franchise managed to redeam itself and stay that way.
B001993Y3G|4.0|While the movie itself is kind of a guilty pleasure, this Blu-Ray version fixes several issues that the DVD version had. First of all, the re-mastering of the film.  On the DVD some of the scenes (such as the prison scene in the beginning) were SO dark, Morgan Freeman all but disappeared! Hell, KOSTNER was hard to see!  No longer an issue on Blu-Ray.  Also, the volume between the speaking parts and the musical score have been leveled quite sufficiently!  Take the &#34;extended&#34; scenes for what they are, they do add some context to a few scenes that were a bit of a mystery to me in the theatrical version.  The relationship between Mortiana and the Sherriff is FAR more clear.  A few of the other extended scenes showed why they were cut though.  All-in-all I'm very happy with it.  Good entertainment, especially for the price.
B004OEIL54|5.0|Let me just say, I've always been someone who isn't totally up for seeing horror movies or crazy killer movies, but with all the hype this movie was getting I finally said \\"Ok trailer what have you got?\\" I was hooked instantly. This proved to be a very enjoyable movie. The introduction of the killer was done extremly well, this is one scary character to imagine running from. Most characters felt well done and easy to understand, although some were pretty annoying. Surprisingly the humor of this movie, be it lines or the killer stumbling over 50% of whatever ended up in fron of him, proved to be very well balanced with the horror part.<br /><br />What got me into this movie, was the fact that the killer tries to act repeatidly through out the movie, rather then do very minor actions before going after the main character. Also I was surprised how I much I was in detective mode and how I found myself trying to guess who the killer was, not because I was bored with the movie, but because the movie interested me so much. The bored reason is when I usually try and think about it.<br /><br />As the movie went on, it got more intense and when it ended I was impressed with it, and I know I wanted to check the rest out.<br /><br />There are minor gripes with this however. (SPOILER ALERT) Some characters are pretty annoying but thankfully leave, Gale constently getting in the way drove me nuts (Yes it's a sterotypical character but still makes the list). Dewey, Gale and Rodney aren't very interesting in this movie. Finally, this isn't a true dislike, it was pretty easy to guess who the killer was although I wasn't expecting both of the two \\"Real\\" suspects to be partners in crime.<br /><br />Ultimatly though I loved this movie and am really glad I checked it out.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Still what I consider to be the best console controller design EVER!  Does everything it's supposed to do.  Good quality.  Even survives my &#34;tantrums&#34; lol.
B004OEIL5E|5.0|As the title says this movie, actually turned out to be pretty close to the first movie in terms of likeability. The cast members, humor mixed with horror, action and plot all turned out to be just as interesting as the first. And then the sequel added many items that made it even better.<br /><br />I was more interested in the cast's storylines this time. Gale, Dewey, Randy, Sidney, the camera man and everyone else were simply more fun to watch. This movie felt more intense, more complex and harder on the detective side. I was pleased at how better made the death scenes were and I espically loved how this time the killer was more adept at avoiding obsticles, this time the killer only stumbles when he can't stop in time. The ending was actually pretty ingenious, I never say that twist coming from killer #2 and the ending scene was very good at wraping everything up. And to mention the killer in the movie theature bit, I feel this is a good reminder to all of us about theater security given more recent killings.<br /><br />As with the first movie there are some gripes. At first it was hard to make sense of who was who in the cast. The top gun sceme spoof, if Tom Cruise couldm't do it in a way that wasn't annoying, he sure can't.<br /><br />(SPOILER ALERT FOR THE REST) Even though it does help the movie, was it really necessary to kill Randy? The supposed death of Dewey and Gale annoyed me as while Dewey's \\"death\\" was well done, we had already lost one major character did we really need to lose another? And Gale's \\"death\\" was just stupid that felt as if the producers decided \\"Hey let's cap them all off.\\" Thankfully neither died whew. Finally, again not a true dislike, it was harder for me to figure out who the killer was. I did figure it out just before he took off the mask, but by then so many of the suspects had been eliminated there was only one suspect left.<br /><br />Still a sequel that comes on the originals level and one I will definutly say is not at all sub par.par.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I started reading the WOOL Omnibus on Saturday and finished on Wednesday. I could do it faster, but I have been really busy with stuff :) Anyway, the books really make you read without pause! The language of the books is really diverse, and I found it useful reading on kindle, so I could use the built-in dictionaries to translate unknown words (there were some! :). I find the descriptions of the characters, of their actions really plausible, I could imagine people like that easily. And also the actions of the characters are described in a very detailed way, which gives you a chance to plunge into the world of WOOL. And I'm not talking about the breathtaking plot! Thank you, Hugh Howey, for bringing WOOL omnibus world into ours!

I would definitely recommend this product
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|My granddaughter watched this to complete an English requirement at school. She tells me this is a wonderful DVD and both her sisters and her mother are into watching and rewatching The Tempest. The next time they come over they are bringing it to me to watch too. This was a very appreciated gift indeed.
B002NEFL8W|4.0|Everything is top notch, as always. I never would recommend a 3rd party grip on any DSLR. It's almost as bad as buying 3rd party batteries.<br /><br />The grip is pretty big. If i didn't have large hands I would probably return it.<br /><br />I do not regret buying it at all however.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|My wife and I recently decided to donate our collection of aging VHS tapes to the local library.  Before doing so, however, we began watching them day-by-day, since we hadn't seen most of the films in years.  All was going well until we came to `The Nun's Story' (circa 1959) at which time my wife was sadly disappointed.  This had long been one of her favorite films, and this tape was so degraded as to be unplayable.  The next morning, of course, I ordered this DVD and last night we watched it.<br /><br />The film tells the story of a young girl's struggle to become a nun and to serve God, her Church, and those in need.  It is a story of faith, conviction, dedication, and self-sacrifice; and, in the end, disillusionment and abandonment.  In telling this tale, it also gives us a glimpse into the inner workings of the Catholic Church and the demands placed upon those who give themselves up to its service.<br /><br />It is a film that everyone can enjoy and almost everyone will benefit from by watching.  I only wish that films like this were still being made, but no such luck.
1616550414|5.0|OVERVIEW: I have never been so excited when purchasing an item from Amazon before. For Hyrule Historia I was so excited that it motivated me to write my first ever product review. Let me just begin with this, I am not an avid reader to say the least. The last book I read was a requirement for high school 9 years ago. This is the first book in a long time that I actually wanted to read. I recieved this product on 1/30/2013 and I ordered it back in Decemember 2012 when Amazon was taking preorders for it.<br /><br />BUILD: When you open the book, you can tell that the hardcover, binding, and the pages are really well constructed. This is no discount shelf book. The illustrations and the text inside the book are well arranged and they catch the eye really nicely. If you love more pictures than words, then you will be in for a treat. With it's 276 page count, the book is heavier than most textbooks that I have purchased for school. An embossed golden Gate of Time is featured on the front and it is paired well with the Hero of Time's most well known tunic color, green.<br /><br />FEATURES: The best feature about Hyrule Historia is how much attention to detail is used throughout the games that a typical Zelda fan might have missed. Why certain shields are designed the way they are and why the colors of Link's crimson Loftwing are significant are just a few examples. The book also shares the different design concepts that were introduced in the Legend of Zelda series before the final product was decided upon. This lets the reader see how the game could have been and then allows for a possible alternate view of the already loved game. The sequence of events in Link's adventures are in chronological order so the book follows the timeline(s) that were set up by Nintendo. The Legend of Zelda series already has beautiful artwork within its games, but this book does an excellent job of showing powerful images from each and every game. The different games are well divided throughout the book and allow for quick navigation to any game within the series.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Shigeru Miyamoto and his team went above and beyond to create this amazing book. I knew I was going to recieve something I was going to read with much detail, but the level of detail and the beautiful artwork is what fascinated me the most about Hyrule Historia. If you are into the Legend of Zelda series, this is a no brainer. With so much to discover within the franchise, the book will have something new for everyone to learn. I'm extremely happy with this purchase and I'm sure I will be reading this unforgettable piece of art over and over again.ut the book and allow for quick navigation to any game within the series.<br /><br />SUMMARY: Shigeru Miyamoto and his team went above and beyond to create this amazing book.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I love this game on my kindle fire hd! Great fun for my 4 year old granddaughter, nephew who is 7! I also find my self playing the game lol check it, you will love it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am totally hooked. this game has me in its claws and it wont let go. I love the new scenes and challenges.
B008Y5OWSO|4.0|Once upon a time, directors made movies, not producers.<br />Once upon a time, directors took risks describing not so glory situations.<br />Once upon a time, directors shot, and were not thinking about how much entrances their movie could generate.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I watched the first two seasons in a couple of days and couldn't stop there, I bought this year's first three episodes to be brought up to date on the series.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Beautifully written and in a world that seems unfathomable. Can't wait to read pandemonium and continue this journey with Lena
B005ORVMT2|5.0|Back in '77 a friend gave me an old scratched up copy of Rush Caress Of Steel.  My musical tastes were never the same.  Goodbye KSLQ top 40 pop and hello KSHE 95 progressive rock!  This collection of Rush's first five albums reminds me of why I listen to bands like Tool, Stereolab and Stabbing Westward today.  They were pioneers in a music industry that was at another fork in the creativity road.  Bands like Rush ensured that the musical revolution started by The Beatles, Doors, Hendrix and many others in the 60's continued to progress into the 70's and beyond.  I still love the way that Rush could tell a story in the form of a 10 - 20 minute track and keep me interested throughout.  Mega-songs like By-Tor & the Snowdog, The Fountain of Lamneth & The Necromancer now have power and clarity that truly displays the talents and skills of not only the musicians but the engineers who remastered this incredible collection as well.  A must have for all Rush fans and '70's prog-rock fans alike!!
1594481717|4.0|Great book.  Puts things into perspective for me.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking to get a good grasp on how the brain functions.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Absolutely no plot. If you're looking for a movie that brings you to a strip club and stays there, with the occasional scene of gratuitous sex, drugs and nudity - this is your movie.
0345525558|4.0|Good book, good read.  Got through it fast and enjoyed it, I recommend it.  Go ahead and buy it, it's worth the purchase price.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This version isn't as good as the others but I like to use it when I'm not at home. I like the blue flowers. Wish they were on xbox.<br />Every time I load back into minecraft it places me somewhere else<br /> On the map. It's usually night. And I always die. Lol. So if you could fix that, that would be great
1455508977|5.0|I enjoyed the book very much, I saw the movie and wanted to read the book to compare the two.  It was an enjoyable read, I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Nicholas Sparks books.  Nice story.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|I've been looking for good mic for when I do videos. This one for the price is worth it. The length of the cable is good enough even if the speaker is moving.
1439102813|5.0|Good book, sad story.  I felt for the main character in this book, with her memory loss.  It was well written and infomrative about a terrible disease.  I would recommend it, a good read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love it!!!  The Dowager countess Maggie Smith steals the show with just a few words, Lady Mary is great and I love the way Edith is developing.  That Branson seems  a bit softer is a plus his hateful radical attitude is not comfortable to watch.Can't wait for the next season  hope it goes on for years. Hollywood should take a hint and stop the killling movies I don't watch anymore.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book is not bad, but jumps around a lot.  Just about the time it would start getting into a good part of the story, it would jump to another interview.
B008602KQI|5.0|I never thought I would get past the subject matter of this movie, children killing children.  The movie started out very strange and I almost gave up on it.  But I have to say Jennifer Lawrence made this movie.  I had never heard of her before, but she impressed from her first line.  I still had problems with the violence, but the move drew me in and I loved it.  Well done.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|so I just got it and it didn't work right and then I deleted it so that I could re download it but when I triied to re download it it wouldn't let me!
B007N8RULO|4.0|Enjoy Spider Solitaire!  The advertisements are annoying. The touch on the numbers is slow to connect sometimes! Do you offer other games?
B0037ZWZHQ|5.0|I love the soulful voice of the late Marvin Gaye and this CD brought back so many long ago forgotten memories for me.  Marvin Gaye was a man who was ahead of his time.  He was aware of the dire conditions in the world and through his music he sought to help save the world by making folks standup and take notice...phrases such as radiation underground, war is not the answer, save the babies, etc., remind me so much of the messages that the late iconic Michael Jackson tried to impart to us about a dying world.  When will we learn the lessons that these men were trying to teach us?
B002M9WW30|5.0|Having these classics (and even the not-so-classic Rocky V) all on Blu-Ray is outstanding. The extra features are excellent as well.  Happy with the purchase and watching these movies in an excellent format is outstanding.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|if you like a game that's pure killing things and upgrading armour and weapons, this games for you. the graphics are great and if you're playing on a fire Phd this game is sick!
B000I5Y8ZU|3.0|Plays fine, However I think that the CD  was a burned copy from the Original.but its fine and the is still in very good condition.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Loved this book! It made me laugh and cry. The character development was really good and you were able to feel each character's struggles and feelings
B004GYY714|5.0|Thanks to my son's xmas gift; a Kindle Tablet HD I can enjoy my favorite Web Radio program at any time, anywhere.<br />  .
B007SGLZP8|2.0|A very complex and clever plot, as usual with this author. But this time the rythm is missing, the story unfolds itself too slowly, the dialogues are boring and verbose. Not up to his par.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|Just what I was looking for well-written  & great entertainment. I couldn't wait to sit down each night and read a few pages.
B008DKBPTO|4.0|I only wish it was just a bit more quiet when opening the super strong velcro. It is loud enough to wake my husband.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Purchased this as a special gift for my nephew.  He compared this one to all of his other Beyblades, using a watch to time each performance.  This Phantom Orion outlasted all of the others and consistently won its &#34;battles&#34;.  He was delighted (which made me a happy auntie!) and gave it great reviews.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|The thing that scares me is that I feel like I'm actually behind the man, running with him. I get psyched out every time he jumps on a zip line, like I'm going to fall off! The beast is scary. Overall, this is a great app, very realistic and fun. New ways to run every time. The only thing I complain about is that it practically says, &quot;Here's how you do everything&hellip;okay! Let's run.&quot; It may be that they rush through, like I said, or maybe I suck at this game!
B007HACDLK|5.0|I've read all of Vince Flynn's books and think that this was his best. Especially liked the inclusion of Irene Kennedy is so much of this book.
B00ARN0XGG|1.0|This was the least scary movie I've ever seen.  High Schoolers could have put on a play that would equal the performances.  It was part paranormal and part witch coven with northing else thrown in.  It was disjointed, poorly written and a waste of valuable time.  No reason given for anything.  You could go into a coma watching it.  I believe it was suppose to build to a climatic ending.  But there were so many loose ends that nothing made sense.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|&#34;Defending Jacob&#34; was a book I couldn't put down.<br />It will be a great movie soon I hope.  Loved it
B009X011UQ|4.0|It was nice but the cost was a little high for it. I guess I expected a little more for that amount of money. It looks good and works fine.
B0086700CM|5.0|really fun for any age my son and hubby are addicted as am I. great for keeping your brain thinking!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I look forward to each and every episode; each proves more interesting, with more twists and turns. Where has Patrick gon e to and will he return later. Tune n and wait.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I find that my kindle freezes some and doesn't open the game sometimes. had to restart it to play. great graphics for a free game. being a horse owner this is very life like without the back breaking work.
B00913P6G0|4.0|It is a nice album that flows from beginning to end..  There are only a couple of tracks that weren't so appealing.
B0041VV03A|1.0|My friend picked this for a movie night. One of the most ridiculous movies I've ever seen. Can't believe a best actor Oscar winner would agree to this unbelievable premise. It's not even acceptable as a sci-fi, where you sometimes have suspend normal rationale. Adrian Brody had to be desparate to work.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was so fun however I was so addicted that I couldn't get any work done until I solved the mystery.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love how quickly amazon gets all of the episodes available. It's a great way to get started on a series or catch up on missed episodes
B00AF6B2BK|5.0|I have been looking for a mint copy of Powerslave for months and could only find over priced worn out copies. I was so stoked to get this brand new with the awesome artwork and picture disc. The sound is great for a picture disc and it is quite the showpiece for Maiden fans. Highly recommended.
B005LAII80|5.0|Having only watched it in theaters and the Blu Ray version (I do not have a 3D set up), the Blu Ray version is the one I'll be talking about.<br /><br />Dredd was one of my favorite movies from all of 2012. It's a sci-fi action romp with gritty visuals and explosive action that doesn't bother dressing any of it up to try and pretend something else is there when it clearly isn't meant to be. It was pure fun combined with superb acting, a spectacular story, gorgeous visuals, and some of the best action you'll find anywhere.<br /><br />While I always had a soft spot for Stallone's cheesy adaptation of Judge Dredd, Karl Urban's Dredd delivers the kind of man I expect I would fear and respect if I were unfortunate enough to live in Mega City One. The rest of the cast also does a spectacular job and I found myself enjoying Lena Headley as the villain more here then I ever have in Game of Thrones. Olivia Thirlby also delivers a great performance as a rookie judge under Dredd's tutelage on the toughest first bust any Judge could ask for. Honestly, I can't think of anyone in this movie that didn't do their role justice.<br /><br />As for the Blu Ray quality, the movie still looks just as spectacular as it did on the big screen and sounds awesome. The packaging was also your typical Blu Ray fare, which I have no complaints about whatsoever.<br /><br />Overall, the film is well worth the investment, well deserving of five stars, and easily some of the most fun you can have if you're still catching up on 2012's movies.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book had an interesting plot but the ending was a real groaner. If you like all your loose ends tied up in a believable neat package this book is not for you.
B009PK9SB8|5.0|Have the GoPro Hero 3 this attaches nicely on the back of it. Now that the GoPro has an app its a wonder if its necessary or not to have it. Although you can use the app it is nice to use the LCD backpack to line up shots. Don't know if the wireless or the bacpac uses more battery.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written with an interesting glimpse into some of the incredible work done by our intelligence and special ops community.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An amazing, engaging journey! Could not put this book down! Reaffirms belief  that each of us is born with and can develop<br /><br /> L<br /><br />Our gifts.
B004XANKVO|5.0|This backpack is great. If you have any doubts about anything (quality, size, comfort) just put those to rest.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Lots of pockets<br />Comfortable<br />Great padding for the laptop<br />Really nice hard pocket for delicate things<br />Quality stitching<br />Fantastic zippers<br /><br />Cons:<br />Cost<br /><br />I feel like this backpack will outlive me - it is that well made.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This not only works on my Kindle Fire but also works on my cell phone Love it!<br /> It's nice to have a back up
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really enjoyed the book. Sometimes what happens in Vegas does not stay there.  harlequin books have always been my favorite.  No matter how old you get you feel young at heart.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|So glad we watched the in flight movie Search for the Sugar Man. It was so moving and inspired me to buy the DVD and all his cds. Music is still relevant after all these years and his delivery is superb. There are touches of Dylan, echos of Feliciano but most of all it is just simply brilliant Rodriguez. So disappointed that I will be away overseas when he tours Downunder.
0553386794|5.0|I was intrigued by the mythos and wanted to read the books before watching the TV show, although I must say that the screenshots and clips look tantalizing now that I have become acquainted with the book.<br /><br />I could say many great things about the details of this book, but I first and foremost appreciate the epic feel. I suppose this is exactly what high fantasy is supposed to be like. It reminds me of when I first heard Zeppelin, thinking that's exactly what rock'n'roll is supposed to be like. I never could get into LOTR, because I couldn't stomach Tolkein's dense prose. I rather like Martin's writing style. The pages fly by, although the book can still drag slightly at times and takes awhile to read even at my speed. These books are really long, even by my standards. At over 300 thousand words each, they're half as long as War And Peace and three or four times longer than the average novel. I like the occasional comic relief and liberal use of adult language. Martin has a gift for quaint yet understandable phrasing, which adds to the medieval feel without getting in the way of the read. I appreciate the magical realism (not overdoing the fantastic elements); conflict between practical and holy figures perhaps addresses this in-character. There's so much detail in both setting and characters. Martin's narrative mode, switching between limited third person POV's, is intriguing and works very well. Ther'es oftne a good cliffhanger feel when switching POV's. By contrast, sticking to one first person POV can be limited in what it reveals of the setting and secondary characters.<br /><br />Despite some apparently clear heroes and villains, it isn't clear what side to take. Many bad things happen to good people. Some deaths were a senseless surprise. That seems both realistic and painful to read. Some writers make things go too easy for the heroes; Martin errs in the other direction at times. Robb was trained well, but that seems to include carrying over Ned's impractical honor. Ned had some serious work to do ruling in the King's place. I thought he showed some firm leadership there, but I was afraid the situation was going to blow up in his face anyway.<br /><br />Jon Snow, Tyrion Lannister, Samwell Tarly and the Targaryens illustrate what's it's like to be sort of nobility but not really in a world where that's everything. No wonder Jon befriends Sam. I empathize with Sam as a nonmacho but otherwise valuable individual. However, I was amused by the guy talk in the males-only group that is the Night's Watch.<br /><br />I figured the Arya-Sansa conflict was more than just a tomboy-girly girl personality clash, but I wasn't sure what. Perhaps disdain for Sansa's romantic naievete, in general or about Joffrey in particular? I wondered when she would lose her fantasies about Joffrey, and the eventual answer was obvious enough.<br /><br />Arya disarming Joffrey was one of the amusing early parts, \\"tell about how you got disarmed by a nine year old girl with a broom handle\\" or somesuch being one of Martin's many great one-liners. Maybe liking that part was a sign of how much I already disliked Joffrey.<br /><br />Many characters do adult things very young. Do they grow up fast? Does Martin's variety of human mature faster? The females being wedded and bedded young might be part of the environment's misogyny, but many male characters seem beyond their years as well. Incompetent boys in power might be a purposeful criticism of hereditary authority. Is the misogyny over the top on purpose, or simply part of the medieval setting?<br /><br />Bran thinking Jaime and Cersei were wrestling with their clothes off is a classic line for a kid catching people in flagrante delicto.<br /><br />Though I had sympathized with the Targaryens for being usurped, I was pleased with the eventual putdowns of Viserys for being hard hitting and appropriate.<br /><br />Is Martin trying to say something about racial issues with the Dothraki as amongst the few dark-skinned peoples present? If so, what? Tactically, they reminded me of Mongols in particular. On Drogo and Daenerys' first night, he seemed surprisingly gentle for a barbarian warlord. At the end of that chapter, I wondered if they went all the way. Likely so, but Martin chose an artful way to handle it. Things did get weird in the middle of their relationship; \\"She was glad he took her from behind as was the Dothraki fashion so he wouldn't see her tears and the pillow would muffle some of her screams\\" has to be one of the sadder lines I've read.<br /><br />I worried about Westerosi infighting with the Dothraki coming, but that doesn't seem to be an issue, at least not yet.<br /><br />I hadn't figured out the wine was poison, but it makes sense.<br /><br />It was obviously right to interrupt war rape. I didn't think it would appear to have a practical benefit, but even that blows up on Daenerys.<br /><br />I liked the tactical description of the battles, particularly the one with Tywin's army (where Tyrion leads the left flank)<br /><br />All of this copious sex seems to be heterosexual except for rumors about one knight totally uninterested in the intimate affairs of women.e few dark-skinned peoples present?

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love Temple Run 2! It is so much fun and very challenging. The mine is my favorite part because inside the mine there are many obstacles. Once you get in its hard to get out; which makes it more fun. The gems are fun to get! I like the powerups because they're really helpful. I like Temple Run 2 much better than the original! Overall its a great game and I recommend it to everyone! I hope a Temple Run 3 comes out!

B0055PMJMW|5.0|I always read the full books, but these three stories by Connelly were great. One of my favorite writers. The Kindle version is a bargain.
B00000C28M|5.0|Glenn Gould and Leonard Bernstein's famed performance of the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor is well worth the experience. This is definitely a very different interpretation by a very unique artist, and the added pre-concert speech by Bernstein and radio interview of Gould add very interesting color to the performance. You may not agree with the interpretation, personally, but it makes you rethink how pieces can/should be played.

8866130915|2.0|This is a nice, convenient little planner, in a convenient size, and nicely formatted for flexible use.  However, it is quite costly for what you get. Sadly, after buying this for my 18yo son, we were browsing in the dollar store, and he found a similarly formatted planner, of comparable quality, and slightly larger in size, that he liked better (a bit more flexible for planning and a bit more room to write), so this one was abandoned.  I felt it was a waste of $13. I have since been using it as an expense tracker--but again, I could have gotten this at the dollar store! I don't have many expenses as a stay-at-home mama--just once or twice a week to a grocery store, a handful of online purchases, and another errand or two every couple weeks. And that is enough information to fill up this little book!<br /><br />I like the blank pages on the right hand side of each open spread. Great for notes! But that is the same format we found in the dollar planner, too!  I also like the elastic closure that holds this shut in a neat, tidy little book.  The dollar version does not have this.<br /><br />This is certainly a nice little planner, but my recommendation would have to be: Go to the dollar store.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I am a lifelong esoteric explorer and shamanic practitioner, having been given the grace of many mystical experiences and I love the marriage of science and spirit.  For the reason of this author's professional education and experience, and his spiritual (or lack thereof) history, and having read many, many books on the death phenomena as well as having participated in NDE studies with experiencers of medical death, I found Dr. Alexander's testament a particularly unique and powerful case for validating the eternity of our nature.  Apparently without knowledge, Dr. Alexander aptly describes the Bardo states of consciousness which are well-documented in Buddhist philosophy and authentically articulates certain spiritual realms regularly experienced by psychopomps in their endeavors to aid those making the Great Transition.  Worth having in your library if the mystery of the death experience either intrigues you or is part of your study.  As is attributed to the Buddha, &#34;If you die before you die, then when you die, you won't die!&#34;.

B001NUO1HE|4.0|I am a diver and must say I enjoyed this film. I really don't buy into the amount of time these people did breath holds but I have to let it go for movie magic.  The shark scene was a bit much and not buying it either but it did make it more interesting.  How exciting can you make a dive movie these days since the Abyss came out.  I would never expect  a really real dive movie any way.
B0029ATTAQ|4.0|I purchased this solely because the English/American (Region 1) version of the DVD is out of print. This All Regions version from Korea is in English, and is definitely worth the price, considering its availability. I have no problem with it, it plays great, and I have actually purchased other Korean (All Regions) versions of films on DVD like this in the past - including Eraserhead. If you don't mind that this is the only version you can get for a reasonable price, and you don't mind the smell of the plastic case (its made from different plastic than the DVD cases in America), and you don't mind the Korean writing on the case - its a great deal! I'm satisfied with it and you could be to!
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Entertaining but very little there to really make you care or want to find out what happens.  I would give it a 2.5 / 5
B0000C9V3T|5.0|The music of this film is so exciting and well assembled. This soundtrack was completely worth buying, and I'm very happy with it. It isn't simply the music on this cd either, there are excerpts of dialogue and sound effects from the film which are equally entertaining! Totally satisfied.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is so much fun the graphics are so much better then he first one you have a zip line and you go threw a mining thing its great there's a lot of new power ups you can do. I would deff recommend this game to anyone
B007D5E7C2|5.0|The first time I saw these films, I fell completely in love with them. There not being an American version in any special edition and what-not (which I would prefer to purchase), I opted to buy them together somehow. I would not have purchased this if it weren't on two discs. Though fortunately it is. And the special features - though minor as they may be - are surely worth something. I'm quite satisfied with this product, its price, quality, and most of all, the wonderful, wonderful films themselves! Great buy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Thar's really 101- in- games so cool not disappointing. its really fun and has a lot of variety. I really love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Love Colleen Hoover and her stories.<br />THey captivate and move me.  The depth and serenity of her characters leave me wanting MORE MORE MORE.<br /><br />Great story and would love to see another sequel.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|When I read an overview of the content I was hesitant to purchase it as it sounded depressing.  So glad I took the plunge.  Jojo is wonderful at character development.  They are three deminsional, interesting & real. I highly recommend this book
B0063GORYU|4.0|This version of solitaire is my favorite,  It's so much fun and always a challenge.  I never get tired of playing it.

B005LAIHPY|5.0|Wicked awesome movie, this was a geek buy but it was worth it, I loved it and was shocked at how good it truly was, definitely worth watching

B00B2V66VS|2.0|This is the worst game I have ever played in my life.  The big monkey thing scares me.  DON'T BUY THIS GAME.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Like stepping back in time!  Nice boxed set with a lot of extra's.  Great quality recordings on 180 gram records.  Far superior to the original.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is just amazing because you get to learn more about taking animals especially horses even if it loads slow its worth it
B000A0GXGA|5.0|This DVD provided a nice little taste of the Maverick series.  You could buy it for the episode &#34;Shady Deal at Sunny Acres&#34; alone; it showed both Maverick brothers and all their buddies at their best--conning a con man, and brilliantly I might add.  The other episodes were enjoyable too, of course.
B009JZVT70|5.0|It is ONCE upon a time. Who wouldn't love it? It has love, adventure, and almost every beloved fairy tale characters and more. Also great actors and special guests.
B0026772N8|5.0|This is an excellent read.  I found myself drawn in by philosophical questions and Ideas and paused to ponder the implications and deeper meanings.  As the reader you travel along on the cycle as a third party examiner of the writers examination of himself and the world around him and in turn see your own world with a higher level of introspection.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|Because of this, I'm able to write anything. Like when a story clip comes to me, I can write it down because I have this.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Installed this on my tablet it does do what it says but since I dont have a flash on my tablet it utilizes the screen for light this is better suited for cell phones which uses a flash.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|The Oregon Trail: American Settlers is a fun, simple game with great graphics.Would give it 5 stars if it wasn't so dependent on having friends for energy.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I installed this on my tablet and it works as discribed frees up much valuable space since installing my tablet seems to be running faster as well as smoother.
0891419063|5.0|I am a big fan of &#34;Sledgehammer!  We need more men like him today.  Would be nice if he was still around and could replace our current President.  Fran Foreman
B008SOS63S|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves great guitar and rock/blues music.  Naturally any fan of Joe Bonamassa will enjoy this.  His rendition of Woke Up Dreaming on the bonus disc is incredible
B007VUCAVO|5.0|If you are comfortable just looking at the \\"slowly draining battery icon\\" on the top of your Kindle Fire HD, or feel that Circle battery widget provides enough information, then you won't need this. However, if you really do want an accurate estimate of the specific number of hours you have, depending upon the usage, then consider this app.<br /><br />It provides four different screens -and they are all very appealing to the eye. The first screen offers an overview of remaining time --with a visual image of a battery in case the words don't sink in :-), screens two and three offer details on likely time remaining deepening on different types of usage; and screen four shows the details on your battery health.<br /><br />I liked it so much on the Kindle that I put it on my Galaxy S2 as well. It is pretty accurate as far as its estimates have been for me -especially on the Kindle Fire where I can't change the battery. Also it is very clear in the information displayed -and very stylishly designed too!<br /><br />It's worth getting, and worth every penny of the price!
B0074JODP8|5.0|What can you say about Joe B??  The version of Woke Up Dreaming on the bonus disc is incredible and worth the price of the disc alone!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|temple run 2 is entertaining I have a lot of friends who play so it is fun to compete with them
B00AEFY552|3.0|I kept going over and over the reviews on amazon about this bluray being shotty. So I held off buying it until i figured they had worked out the bugs. The bugs being the not so good transfer of the film into the bluray format. I bought it when i heard it was all set and received it and checked the indicators that it was the newer edition distributed by WB. The picture quality on about 60% was high quality while many of the scenes had a heavy grain accompanied by specs of blinking small lights. It was enough to be very much noticeable. Im not going to send it back because i doubt they will com out with another for sometim and im content with the way it is right now.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|As usual Jodi Picoult has written a book that will keep you reading to get to the outcome of the story and give you another perspective. One view is not always the right one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|buckets e need them ito be easier to make a farm to craft obsidan and other<br />but this is my faveoite game since I cant afford the Pc version and 6.0 came out
B006LSZECO|3.0|I devoured every word.  Would have ended it when she showed back up and left readers to compose their own ending!
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I love this movie!!!!!! It really opens your eyes to know that there is strange and weird people looking for answers to the after life. I recommend this movie for people who love disturbing and gory movies. NOT FOR THE BEGINNERS WHO JUST STARTED WATCHING HORROR MOVIES!!!!
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I bought this book after Mitch @ DVDCatalyst suggested I read it. My disability affects my short-term memory, so I struggle to remember some things after 2, 3 pages. So after I read the first half of the book, Part 1 of TDKR was released. Again, it was strongly suggested I buy it. I. Absolutely. Loved it. I still have not read the second half of the book, but I purchased Part 2 through Amazon after many strong reviews were being left, mostly from those who had seen Part 2 on Amazon Instant Video before the Blu-Ray release. I just finished watching Part 2, and the amount of violence surprised me for a Batman release, but I am not knocking it; actually it gripped me more than Part 1. I most definitely recommend it, without a doubt. And I will still read the second half of the book. :')
B0076DELIG|4.0|I liked this one very much and its written so that's a fast read . You can't wait to get to the end of this thriller . PLEASE NOTE THAT I LIKE THE BOOK .AMAZON SEEMS TO THINK THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE BOOK ?<br /> Their IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH THEIR SYSTEM.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|It didn't even download on my kindle fire even when I have wifi at my houyou gse I don't think you get it my opinion
B007THA4FI|2.0|I find it hard to believe that JK wrote such a depressing story. I have a rule that I always finish every book i start no matter how bad, because sometimes at the end there is a redeeming quality. Not so with this book. I find it hard to believe that any small town could possibly be this dis-functional.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just picked this show up in the past month, and have gobbled up all three seasons (well, until the current-running program in Feb.). The quality of the Prime membership and view of this product is wonderful.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|if you have any inkling of what rural highland & island life is like in Scotland or if you want to know, this captures it wonderfully.  The story is captivating as well.  I look forward to ready the following 2 books in the trilogy.
0345803507|5.0|Though others consider this trilogy a sex story I also believe I was captivated by the psychological ramifications of the main character.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|Gave this as a gift and the recipient seemed to be very excited about it!  Must have chosen something good to give!
0345803493|5.0|The books make you want to read quickly to find out what happens next.  The story reads quickly and definitely captures your attention.  The psychology behind the main character is intriguing and mysterious.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|I will have to say i thought that this movie would suck. but it turned out pretty good. i'm not big on multipul story movie but this one was good. now i have to see valentine's day. i thought that it was well written and it had some very good actors in it. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
0345803485|5.0|Read in order, and you will will want to continue reading the sequels.  My friends and I all want to know how this couple will deal with each decade of their lives. The author has a goldmine waiting for her in sequels, rather than movies.
5555633343|5.0|This is a awesome soundtrack it is fun and enjoyable to listen to the best songs on this soundtrack are all of them. if you have not listened to this soundtrack then i recommend you do
030758836X|5.0|This ending really makes you think about fate, escapism, getting caught in a rut, responsibility, loyalty and utter frustration, not necessarily in that order.  It is the kind of story that could happen to anyone.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|great reminder of how much fun Mario brothers was. I love it. great way to pass some time with an interactive game.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|This was a very surprising movie; I had not expected it to be funny nor a comedy-love story, but it had both.
1594202842|5.0|The book was not hard for me to stomach since I grew up with an Asian Tiger Mother.  The book brought back fun memories for me.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Started a little slow but now I can not stop reading.  I am half way thru.Have always enjoyed Grisham's books.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Addictive and fun. Would suggest for anyone that doesn't like little green piggies. One of series would recdommend downloading series
B006LSZECO|5.0|I will admit that the first portion of the book reads like your typical murder mystery, but in the middle it swerves down the path of a pychological thriller and I couldn't put it down! Give this book a chance.
B008602KQI|5.0|Good read. Would suggest to those that enjoy reading on their Kindle Fire- the best way to read a book
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Horton Hears a Who (Single-Disc Edition)  Visual delight and great work of actors! Story could be too mentorish, but they turn it into something very beautiful and fun.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Addictive and fun. Would suggest for anyone that doesn't like little green piggies. One of series would recdommend downloading series
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Sons of Anarchy is such a great show!  The characters, the story line, the locations, the props, it all comes together to make this show that much more real.  I have turned so many people on to this show and once they saw one episode they were hooked.  I have all seasons right now 1 thru 4 and I have to say each season just gets that much better than the one before.  Looking forward to season 5 beginning.  I will be buying that once on DVD as well.  LOVE this show!!!
B005HSL626|2.0|Not a fun game. Hard to play Took forever to download. Not n Kindle fire or android phone. Would not suggest
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Have on my Samsung Galaxy II and Kindle Fire.  Works well on my Sanding.  Kindle Fire is another story...very slow and you cannot steer the character to the sides on the path for coins etc.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Addictive and fun. Would suggest for anyone that doesn't like little green piggies. One of series would recdommend downloading series
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Fun game to play, glad I found it ,very addictive! I'm a hairstylist and its a great pass time game to play between clients!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Not a fun game. Hard to play Took forever to download. Not n Kindle fire or android phone. Would not suggest
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie was right up my ally!  I love movies that evoke questions about what I would do or concepts out of the norm.  The action on screen was enough to keep my husband entertained.  I like the mix of good/bad and the motivations that drove the characters.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|good easy to use and free would suggest to others needing a simple calculator for their kindle fire thank you
B009NXV2RK|3.0|I bought the book for a plane flight, and it fulfilled it's general intended purpose - but only just. The book lacks depth and just became so predictable that I struggled through. In short, the good guys are Americans (and they will always win). There are some other good guys in the world, but they are incompetent without US help, and then there are the bad guys - and they are bad.<br />What frustrates me is that the basis of the book - the rise of China and will this country democratise and secondly the potential of cyber warfare are a fantastic basis. This book should have been brilliant. It just became so lame and predictable. Also, Tom Clancey should have researched a little better and discovered that there is another country in Asia that has already in recent history had some interesting military interactions with the chief country of concern in this novel - and this country gets one mention in passing. In short - the basis and potential of this book is great and high - the delivery is predictable, flat and ill researched and delivered.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|Fairly easy to use. Syncs well and information doesn't &#34;disappear&#34; like with other calendars I've used. Would suggest it highly
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|This is my first exposure to Jane Austen. After going back to the beginning a 2nd time the story became clearer.
B001JRB16U|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone!  This movie never gets old.  I remember watching it when I was a little girl and now, sharing it with my grandchildren.  They LOVE it and have been going around the house, singing the familiar tunes!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|This is an enjoyable read. Since I have read other Jane Austen books this is turning into a good read too.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|This is an exact replacement for my husband's lost Skagen.  He wears this watch daily and it stands up to him and looks timeless.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This season keeps you guessing, gasping, and wondering.  I sat on the edge of my seat for most of it!  So good!!!!
6304698623|5.0|This is an all-time favorite. I watch it with my 4-year-old granddaughter every time she spends the night. She knows favorite parts by heart and loves the sense of wonder and suspense. It's a great story told with humor and love.
B00005214X|4.0|Classic George Harrison with one of his best albums; great re-mixing and bonus tracks on each of the two discs that I had never heard.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|If you loved the many productions of Les MIs, it's all here, with famous and not-so-famous story tellers (singers) doing their best to blow us away - and they do in this wonderful stage production of the songs from the play.
B009369Z8A|5.0|I chose this rating because I live in Franklin County, VA and I have heard a lot of the stories about the time period in which this movie is all about. I have taken a bus tour of the town in which many of the locations of the events shown in the movie were pointed out and I have seen other places where events occurred that were mentioned in the movie. I have met some of the descendants of the characters in the movie, also. My late uncle made moonshine. My first housewarming gift when I moved to this area was a gallon of moonshine.
6304698690|5.0|Great movie for kids maybe 8 and up - wonderful characters and story, teaching children about friendship, caring and courage.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|I chose this rating because I have always been a fan of the Bourne movies and I think that Jeremy Renner did a great job in this movie. I love the Jason Bourne character played by Matt Damon, too.
1451627297|5.0|Intriguing subject and a page turning nail-biter, especially the last 350 pages. I stayed up all night to finish it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|great review oftime and history. Makes you remember the grassy knoll,and where you were that day.Lee was a poor excuse for a marine.11/22/63.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is very addictive. Once you start you can't quit! Lots of fun. Love it. Downloaded for my granddaughter but I play it more.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This story was intense; hard to put down once started. But near the end and the ending were quite disappointing. The author had a great hero, but the hero became part of the evil of the miniature world. It was also anticlimactic, and disappointing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is an awsome games but I just do not know how to get the latest updates for it on my kindle fire HD!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I read this book for my book club. Although some of the members were not crazy about the book, but the discussion was great. The book will have you thinking about life and the meaning of want versus need and how we use our times. The story of the main character and his love for his wife was real and pure. I don't want to say much more about the book, but Mitch Albom has done it again.
B00873GRU4|5.0|It's not often a story is so mesmerising.<br />Definitely one of the best ever. There's no hi-tech, just a brilliantly written story of human spirit standing up against the enforced ignorance of this \\"wool\\" world. Should come with a<br />Warning: this book is extremely hard to put down.<br />Can't wait for the next book.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games has probably been the most popular series since Twilight and Harry Potter. It's hard not to hear what people are saying about them at this point. A lot of people think their just an excuse to write about kids killing kids. A chance to spin a love triangle for another \\"silly YA romance.\\" In all honesty the reason I've put off reading them is simply because popular books usually tend to let me down. Well I can definitely say this book is an exception.<br /><br />The world that The Hunger Games takes place is a futuristic look where the USA no longer exists, the land is different now, Panem is the new power. The Capital runs the country and the people of the 12 districts are ruthlessly controlled. Starvation is a common thing to die from and people rarely make it to old age. Once a year two children of each sex is drawn to participate in The Hunger Games, where they will fight to the death. The Capitals reminder that rebellion against them is futile and that the people should be grateful to have such a government.<br /><br />HG is a shocking look into the type of government system that every human fears. Where one wrong word or action could be taken as rebellion against the government, when it was only an act of survival. It's amazing hearing the indifference of the Capital population about the slaughter of innocents, kids between the ages 12-18. The world is well thought out and a cold slap. One that I thick every reader should experience.<br /><br />Even though Collins first entry into the series is small and her writing style simple, everything is felt. Every time Katniss avoided death I was their experiencing it, I could believe in her no nonsense character. Each character comes across exactly as the author painted them, caring, frivolous, loving, scary, deadly, and sad. What's more is the love triangle in her is phenomenal. Katniss is girl who doesn't want love or the consequences of bringing a child into such a horrible world. Love is nothing she's pondered about, she has more important things to worry about such as keeping her family alive and fed. This causes the love story to become enchanting as it creeps up on Katniss.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is well worth all the buzz. It's raw and haunting, leaving readers to ponder the story long after they've read that last page. The romance is beautiful and subtle--and I can count on one hand how many love triangles I've read that I can actually say felt real, and I wanted to continue. The first book sparks a fire within to see the Capital fall and the people freed--rebellion. This book played so well with my emotions I know that I'll follow this series to whatever end.<br /><br />Sexual Content: Some kissing and stuff. There's a lot of human cruelty in here.<br /><br />4/5- Great! Really enjoyed it<br /><br />Originally reviewed at Book Whispers.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Overall, I really enjoy this game. The only complaint I have is that sometimes when trying to use the &quot;save me&quot; feature, it goes blank and starts the game over. It can be extremely frustrating. Especially when you've gone a great distance. Oh well, I can't complain...it was free! I still would recommend it to anyone.
0920668372|5.0|This makes me cry with each reading.  I bought it for my son<br />when his son was born.  It was also a favorite with my preschoolers during \\"center time\\". They would always start singing when the child sang.  They loved it!!  It expresses real<br />LOVE...the LOVE that passes all understanding.  The LOVE that endures thru the ages.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It got here quick and easy I love this movie!! It's just what I expected. I recommend everyone needs to get this movie
0843178167|5.0|We had a little miss Sunshine birthday party (essentially-- lots of yellow). This was something that we used instead of a card for our little girl.
1595826971|5.0|I will highly recommend this book to both the fans of the game and artists who's seeking inspiration. This book went far beyond all expectations. With almost 200 pages, this is an enjoyment for the creative-mind from beginning to end.<br /><br />I loved the game, I love this book,<br />I'll promise you, this book is a piece of art. Don't hesitate, you won't regret buying this!<br /><br />- Kim B
1926778537|4.0|This book is positively stuffed with Darksiders 2 art.  Most of it is concept art by some really talented guys who emulate Joe Mad's art style and philosophy with deft competence.  And Mad himself has a few pieces of course. There's over two hundred pages; 217 of content to be exact.<br />I know everyone has different criteria for what they like in an art book, and my complaint with this book is something that may or may not bother you: there is almost no commentary.  There is a couple of pages at the end but other than that you get no written insight to the process of design.  That being said, there is such an immense amount of art in this volume, so many sketches and painted pieces that they almost tell the story themselves.<br />As a Darksiders fan I found this volume great to flip through and every time I go back I noticed something I hadn't noticed before. The book covers characters, enemies, weapons and places.  The places section is pretty sparse, but the rest of the sections are not.  There are a couple of missing enemies but they are mostly all there.  There's a couple that appeared int he first game that didn't make it in and then there is a boss and a couple of regular enemies that I don't recall seeing but it's possible I missed them due to the vast plethora of enemy art.<br />  Oh, there's a section with CGI models as well, which is a nice addition.<br />The binding is good. The pages are thick.  Amazon's asking price makes this killer visual tribute to a killer game a must-have for any fan.  The only reason i dock it a star is because of the lack of commentary.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|The cover did not fit my kindle fire.<br />No information was included ad to how to send it back.<br />I still need a proper fitting  cover.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I was blown away by this effort by PM.  I have played this for many unsuspecting friends.  Even after giving many clues they couldn't figure out who was singing.  A work of epic proportions.  I hope Paul does more cd's in this style.

B003V1WTMM|4.0|Kate Morton always writes interesting stories with complex characters.  As one of my favorite authors, by the end of her books she always manages to tie everything together.  The Distant Hours was an excellent story but probably my least favorite of her books.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I just got a kindle on my 14 Th birthday and I am addicted to Temple Run 2!!!!!!!!! It's so amazing, the best game I ever played. Temple Run is not as fun and entertaining but Temple Run2 will leave you at the edge of your seat, anxious(and nervous) to see what obstacle will pop out at you next. Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! :) truly a game not to be messed with!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun to play. but you can tell they want your money. but fun anyway. worth the download. not a bad game to continue daily. passes down time faster. fun fun fun
B004XWMXW4|3.0|Not nearly as good as &#34;The Piano Guys&#34; or the &#34;Sacred Cello&#34; series...  Selections are in, IMO, mediocre.  Stephen Sharp Nelson they are not...
B002RVCD0U|4.0|I liked #1, I liked #2 better than #1.  I didn't like #3 very much although it was very exciting.  It was also pretty stupid IMO.  This one is interesting and goes in a different direct as much as a terminator movie can go in a different direction.  Liked how Arnold was in the movie too as his young self.  Of course the effects are better than the other movies too.  But so are the effects on all movies now.<br /><br />But I liked the plot and story line this time too.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The main characters in this book seemed real and complex. It took a while for the story to unfold and the tension that leads to the climax made the book exciting to read.<br /><br />When Sky found out the information about her father/from her father - I found that part of the book less believable. I don't think that in a dramatic moment a character suddenly spills all of the information about what happened in the past (to her and other characters). Also, it doesn't seem believable that Sky and Holdenw would be able to just flee the scene of a crime and never bequestioned about it.<br /><br />Also, after all of the trauma that several characters in the book faced - it seemed like there would major therapy needed before the characters could move on and have relationships.<br /><br />First part of the book - great read and hard to put down. Last part of the book - predictable in parts and not believable. That being said, I would try another book by this author. In general I found her writing style appealing.
B000YJ54DU|2.0|I just got into Lee Child's books.  I've enjoyed reading about Jack Reacher. It's not perfect but there are usually all the elements that I like in a story, action, mystery, horror, anti-republican politics.<br /><br />Just kidding about the last one.  I wouldn't figure Jack Reacher for a liberal but I guess he is now.  This story drags but the most disappointing part was the politics.  I don't know why there had to be politics in this at all, other than local politics.<br /><br />Ok, so Mr. Child thinks the war in Iraq was wrong and too many soldiers were getting killed because their vehicles were improperly armored.  I assume he feels the same way about Afghanistan and also doesn't like the war under Obama but I hope I never find out.<br /><br />Because I read these books as an escape, not to have political slant force fed to me.  If I want to hear how bad the Republicans are, I'll got to MSNBC.  Please, Mr. Child keep politics out of these novels.  I don't care if you suddenly become a right wing conservative and don't like Obama anymore.  I still don't want to hear about it in a Jack Reacher novel.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The game is really cool. You should get the first one b4 you get this one. Tho really awesome. yup.
B004WGIXX4|2.0|This was so surface and so poorly acted that I lost interest in the first 20 minutes. I usually like Natalie Portman, but this was a really bad fit for her.
B005D4YOY6|5.0|I wear these every day, perfect for warm climes. Great traction and while cool as sandals provide all-important toe protection- wouldn't want to rip a toenail off on the Bangkok pavement. The shiitake/Bombay Brown color combination is my favorite so far in this line.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I appreciated Flynn's attention to detail at every nook and corner. For me, it got off to a bit of a slow start but picked up steam to the point where I couldn't put the book down. As you read, you garner an appreciation for the amount of planning that went into the bulk of the novel and the psychology of the sociopathic mind.<br /><br />With the good, however, comes the bad. There really aren't any redeeming, positive qualities in any of the characters. This isn't necessarily bad, but when you reach the end you end up wanting to knock some sense into someone.<br /><br />The novel wove this great, intricate, head game thriller but fell completely flat when it came to the end. It disappointingly unexpected. With that being said, I gave it three stars because up until the end it was a good read, capitalizing on the sensationalism of true crime stories when it comes to the media. If it weren't for the ending, I would've given it a much higher rating, but it is apparent that the author was mentally drained. After reading the book, you can understand why.<br /><br />I would recommend it regardless.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|There are so many things wrong with this movie and few things right.  First of all the science behind the genetic manipulation and the \\"magic\\" potions to maintain the newly enhanced mental and physical abilities of this pseudo Jason Bourne is pure hogwash.  This movie is not about Jason Bourne but a \\"new, improved\\" genetically enhanced successor to Jason Bourne who must fight an even  \\"newer\\" model to the death.  What is this Superman light or perhaps Spartacus light?  The action sequences will keep your attention, so that gets the movie 2 stars.  The ending is very anemic and cries out, \\"We will make another lousy sequel.\\"<br />If you see this movie, please get paid to see it.  Even a free DVD is not worth it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|All I can say about this game is that it is totally awesome and addictive. Like the other games Gameloft Live has made I think this is the best one yet. ;)
1423140605|5.0|Read all the book in this series so I knew what I was getting when we purchased.  Good deal for the hard cover!
034580404X|5.0|Very stimulating. I decided to read the trilogy once I heard Dr. Oz suggesting it on his show.  Waooooooooo!  Read it and you know what I mean.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really liked version 1, and this is indeed better, although I miss the tribal drums from version 1.  Great to look at and fun to play.  They really a accomplished their goal of making the user experience less rigid.  Now you almost get vertigo careening through the 3-d course in the clouds.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to the series.  Not a fairytale happy ending, but a fitting, positive, and poignant end to the story.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'd actually give it 4.5/5 because the audio is a bit compressed but that's the case with every streaming service I've tried. The HD picture quality is very good.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Very cute, intriguing, romantic story for the digital age. Kind of reminds me of the movie you've got mail but now its texting. Love it!
0307887448|5.0|Ready Player One starts out a little slow, but boy does it really pick up. The 80's references were wonderfully integrated into this story. The dynamics between two of the characters reminded me of the relationship between Crash and Burn in the movie Hackers. This made the characters a little easier to envision.  I would highly recommend reading this book.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is quite entertaining for a free app. It passes the time on long train journeys. Would recommend it if you like horses
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love temple run 2 I got it for my kindle fire and it is sooo fun me and my friend sat on my bed and played it for a long time<br />It's addicting.if they make a 3 I can't wait to see it. Lol
B008OW1S3O|5.0|Without a doubt, the best CD of the year. Love it. And it was refreshing hearing a great sound  without going to the same old places.
B008Y6UND6|5.0|Twisty, slightly gothic plot.  Very visually and emotionally captivating.  Can't wait for the sequel.  Highly recommend this movie.  Great cast as well.
B005LAIH54|4.0|Wrath of the Titans was a action packed fast paced and enjoyable movie to watch.  I'm glad I purchased it.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Good side: Very good graphics, enticing challenges, and it is pretty easy to get into...<br />Bad side: It is prone to closing when I die and hit Save Me, which not only ends my game but still takes one of my gems (and those are hard to come by).<br /><br />To me It seems a little more, wewantyourmoney, but over all it is a pretty good game. PARENTS: remember to put a password on your account so the kids can't buy gems on accident...
B0031RAOVY|5.0|You will need a large box of tissues when you watch this movie.  It is a great family time movie.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is both fun and addicting! Once you start you just want to keep playing! Its so much cooler than the first one!
B003Y5H54W|5.0|Red Riding Hood is not the fariy tale we all remember as children.  A great twist awaits the viewer.<br />I am totally glad I bought it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Hard to put down, lengthy but easy read. Some of the characters' personal relationships contrived a bit much. Highly recommend reading this.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|Enjoying it so far. A lot like Super Mario Brother. Seems pretty easy though.  My younger daughter would enjoy it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I don't care for teenage angst books. Maybe because my teenage years have long past and my empathy seems limited. Not to say these teenage problems are insignificant because they are not. It's just that some of the romantic YA are silly. Because of this I was not interested in reading Hopeless but it was given to me as a gift. I am so thankful. It is a lovely inspiring book. I recommend it highly. Th teenage heroine Sky is a strong and devoted daughter and friend. The teenage hero Dean is the type of boy/man all young and older women would love to have in their life. He is beyond kind and sympathetic. With out spoiling the plot he helps Sky come to terms with her past, which in turn helps him cope with his past. I recommend Colleen Hoover's books. Her writng is inspired and allows readers like myself who have felt turned off by YA books to reconsider. Hopeless made me a fan. It was about love but the love of a boyfriend, daughter,friend and most importantly the love of ones self. It expresses how guilt and blame tear you down but understanding and self exploration make you stronger. Thank you Ms.Hoover for opening  my eyes.
B000002PCS|5.0|This is a great CD to listen to when you want to sit back and relax or for backround music while you do other things.  It is very pretty music.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|There are places in this recording of Jeff Beck playing his electric guitar that are almost &#34;painfully&#34; beautiful! Like a wonderful voice at its best! The only other similar experience I've heard with a &#34;mastered&#34; instrument that stood out so vividly for me was a Shirleigh Moog (wife of Robert Moog...) produced recording of Clara Rockmore playing her original-version of the Theremin. Recommended!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I started playing this game just to kill a a couple of bored minutes and ended up playing all night.  Deceptively simple yet difficult at the same time.  Very smooth play and it doesn't ask you for money every thirty seconds.  Definitely worth it to download and keep in the carousal for those bored moments.
B00013RC9I|4.0|A fellow \\"music-nut\\" introduced me to this, and I immediately bought it. Music may be \\"in the ear of the beholder\\" (and my musical tastes are very wide), but this was a \\"must-have\\" for me. Recommended!
B0055B7IPE|5.0|Nice and clean. Good message but not dull. Kept my attention. Recommended by a friend who bought it for his family.
B0035W8QUQ|5.0|Every once in a while, I discover a piece of music that is new to me and is also just plain fun to hear - both immediately and during repeated playings. This was one of those pieces. Recommended.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Although the is common, the element of danger is new in Nicholas Sparks novels. The emotions can really be felt when reading the book. I can't wait for the movie!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Lawless is an excellent movie and I do not make this statement lightly.  All the characters are with flaws however, some are redeemable many are not.  This movie is an explanation of how banning one product in this case alcohol thus creates an opposing and lawless response.  Note to governments, banning a substance simply creates a criminal underground to produce the same product that is banned and with deadly costs.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I probably didn't spend enough time looking into this, but I don't get the whole Pinterest thing, and lost interest in it pretty quickly.  I have already deleted this app.
0061122416|4.0|This book is an easy and fast read. I got it when I graduated college and it was a nice little story of travel, understanding yourself, and finding your place in the world. I would really recommend it to anyone who just graduated college or is looking for a fresh start on the world.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love Angry Birds, and this Star Wars one is especially fun!  Impatiently waiting for the next one to open.
B005IQ39AY|1.0|It has gotten unplayable. I'll get 100+ levels into it, with over 500 balls and this tiny ball will show up and end my game if I fire it... I've played for weeks without problems but now my last several games have all ended this way. Hopefully it gets fixed. GS3.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Very good, very well intertwined story.  Well acted by Sara Paulson, Jessica Lange, James Cromwell, and Lily Rabe.  If you are a fan of classic horror stories, you really should watch this.  Adult subject matter...not for kids.  Can't wait for season 3!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|When I started to play this game I knew it would be awesome but I was wrong it was AMAZING<br /> If your wondering if you want this game get it 5 stars
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It's nice to have this app active so that I can play my Bingo Blitz games on my Kindle Fire now.  They've been pretty good about working on it and updating it so that it is pretty user-friendly.
B0092W59VW|5.0|Hard to describe this album because \\" surfer mariachi \\" does not do it justice. They are modern day composers of south-western  music. Calexico is a genre onto itself. Algiers  has a movie score feel to it and the production in this album is perfect. If your feeling adventurist, give this album a try.
B0095R64AO|5.0|This was one of the most unexpected movie delight for all of 2012 for us. All the prinicpals did a magnificent job with their roles, and the singing at the very end of the movie, plus the music on the final credits were super. I wish I could get a copy of those two singing together that same song. We loved it and have watched it several times already.
B00679T1EO|5.0|We Loved this item! It Arrived quickly, and was packaged nicely. We had great family nights watching episode after episode. Thanks
B003F9G8B8|5.0|This movie just defies words to review it, except to say it is hugely exceptional. Freeman and Damon did a fantastic job, as did the supporting cast. Little mini-plots going on and it all ends superbly. Not to mention it is based on actual history.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I love the new version, but it is so frustrating when I am so far, and I decide to use &quot;save me&quot;, and the app totally closes and remembers it took my gems but not my achievements. Never had that problem with the first one. Otherwise, really fun!!
B004U8VWLE|1.0|Really a disgusting movie. Obviously required some intense acting skills from Portman, but nevertheless I would not waste another moment watching it!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I found this movie on TV by accident and loved it. I don't watch to many movies more than once, but this one is a few on my list that are exceptions. This is by far the best!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game I'm up to level 148 the whistles are great to have I need 2 more moon bounce 2 more bumper cars then all my puzzles r done but will continue to play
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I downloaded this app for my daughter.  Both her and I love it.  Very addicting and very easy to use.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Like many other fans of this show, I was disappointed by the slow moving Season 2 filled with more drama than survival. Season 3 has been action packed with interesting characters and more of the dichotomy of which can be worse, the humans or the walking dead? I am looking forward to the future episodes of this show.
B0099Y2YL6|1.0|If you do not want to hear the ending STOP reading now. I love movies that have happy endings. If you also love happy endings, season 3 IS NOT for you. This movie has one death that is hard to take, and if Anna and Bates happiness is suppose to compensate for that death, all I can say is the writers are not reading their customers (viewers) correctly. As for this seasons ending, this better be one of those cliff hangers where he is JUST seriously injured and lives after all. I will not be pre-ordering season 4, thats for sure.
B007X4ECLY|3.0|Disappointed not as good as antisipated - was looking forward to seeing this movie but did not live up to expectations
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|As good if not better than season 1! We could hardly wait for the next episode to air every Wednesday.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie came in a reasonable amount of time and was in perfect condition. I would recommend this product and seller to anyone. I actually bought it for my boyfriend for christmas and he loved it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show zombie show I have seen in a long time. I will recommend to anyone who loves that genre.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|One of the best zombie movies I have ever seen. Funny with lots of gore. :) I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
B005LAII8K|2.0|This is a strange movie, not really worth wasting your time to watch; I wish I didn't.  Would only recommend to someone I don't like.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Take waking up to the next level with this awesome app!  I have no complaints! One of the best apps I have found. Has met or exceeded all my expectations so far. I use it every morning.
B00004Z4WQ|5.0|funny and a good movie! love the story line mashed up with spoofs! plus anna faris is an amazing actress!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|this series is not so much about zombies as it is about  people in a catastrophic survival  situation.  this series is about human relationships and the struggles within a group when faced with challenges in a post apocalyptic world.  i love this series.
B0082SU98U|5.0|I thought it better than the movie. Disney's version was a nice movie, but the book showed a little more adventures and antics. I can't wait  to start the sequel.
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|I have read all 20 volumes (not the last one), twice and I can sincerely recommend the first three without hesitation as entertaining and instructive about the times, geography and lives of British sailors. If you have to have more, I can recommend up to volume 6, but after that, (volumes 7 to 20) do not have the novelty or excitement of the previous volumes.  The first three and the second three make up a fine story and a sequel; at the end of 3 and the end of 6, the main characters are happy, successful and all the loose ends are tied up neatly. I enjoyed them all, they are all well written, the characters are wonderful, there are lacrymose moments and laugh-out-loud moments and the stories are based on real events closely enough that you can easily pretend this was all real. I will probably read them again, someday.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I've been reading these for only a month and change and I'm already half way through the 3rd one. Definitely worth reading.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This touching story of a family filled with love, adoration, and yet sorrow will melt the heart of the  reader.  The March sisters lives are experienced from childhood to mature adulthood. Dances, parties, picnics, clubs, an  other childish things are recorded along with love, heartbreak, sorrow.  Yet, the family binds together on their love, commitment, and hope.
B00164GDE6|2.0|Movie was a disappointment.  Bad Boys II much funnier, thought I would like to see original.<br />Outdated humor, not worth my time
B0049VZ222|5.0|This was a great opener for the rest of the series. It introduced the characters very well! Although some parts were a little gory and there was some mature content, it was still a great story and didn't distract the audience from the show.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I found myself wondering if this was fictional or based on fact because the author is so convincing in this tale of survival.  This is another book that I had a hard time putting down.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|This was a great sequel to the first season of the Waling Dead! I loved how it introduced more characters and there was some drama added to the story to make it more interesting. I would highly recommend this to any zombie lover!
B009CPES4I|5.0|We enjoyed the movie, of course, but the streaming delivery stopped often, slowed to a trickle, froze the whole Roku system, failed to stream again and again so the experience was seriously degraded from the theater experience.  The service says that when it senses that the download speed decrease so will the quality of the movie, from HD down to something considerably less.  We have, by frequent measure, a download speed of up to 30 mps, yet the system chose to give us one out of four dots of quality more or less arbitrarily for the last 30 minutes.  We are going to be thinking hard about using the Amazon Prime service again.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was a great follow-up to the sequel. As the series grows more suspenseful, it definitely draws the audience in as each episode progresses. I would highly recommend this series to anyone that I know!
086571701X|5.0|This book was a very quick read and covered all the basic material for starting an aquaponics operation.  While it did not give a direct route to success, it provided many examples of successful aquaponics systems, as well as photographs, descriptions and issues to consider.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone considering such an operation, although I would caution that if you are looking for a one-stop shopping experience on how to start raising fish and plants together this is probably not your best bet.  That being said this book is worth it for the cited sources, resource section and collection of testimonials.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Americans don't want to deal with Slavery let alone the horrors of Slavery and the impact this institution had on the enslaved, descendants of the enslaved and American society. Just can't deal with it. And it's not a comedy. That's like saying that a film about the Holocaust was a Comedy. Yes there were some funny parts but the film and the subject matter is not comedy. Slavery was a very brutal and inhumane institution and the film only scratches the surface of this brutality.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I have TR2 for my iphone and love it but so far TR2 for the kindle has only worked twice every time I try to open it it force closed.  I have deleted it and redownloaded it first game after each download has worked but subsequent attempts to play have been for not.  Would love to rate higher but since I cant play that's it :-(
B005Q1W10A|4.0|I purchased all thee seasons of Downton Abbey and when I watch them on PBS, they have scenes that are not in the UK version...why is that?
B003Y5H574|5.0|It was one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a long time.  The movie has a great cast including Ryan Gosling ♥, Steve Carell, Julianne Moore, Emma Stone, and Kevin Bacon.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend it!
B0091REZMW|1.0|I love playing this game on my iPad so thought it would be easy breezy PLAYING on the kindle. Oh boy, was I disappointed !  This game won't even let me get in any of the room that is available to explore. Note to other gamers, you do need invite friends to give you gifts. As far as getting diamonds, you need to keep on exploring to finish your objective.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|We bought this extended version DVD during a time of extra savings and gave one to my mother for Christmas and one for our family.Many extra commentaries about the making of the movie and Von Trapp family
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was skeptical by the name at first and with only 6 episodes, I worried about how good it would be. But it didnt disappointed my expectations, it exceeded them by far!!
B000UR9QIK|5.0|It really is. Its and awesome zombie movie.<br />Also it have a really great documental about, how they do this movie. With interviews to all the actors, and of course Romero himself.<br />Here in M&eacute;xico its like imposibble to get this movie. So this option is great.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|This story will have you on the edge of your seat! You wont be able to stop watching! The drama is just as good as the action that comes with it!!
B002VWNIEA|4.0|It was definitely worth the price. The disc came clean with no scratches and no damage to the case itself.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this app!!!! When I bought this app and started playing it I loved it!!!! It's so much fun. The monkey's pop the balloons but don't let any of the balloons get past you.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love love this app I have it in my iPod touch and kindle fire + computer that was very expensive but I love it I am a girl 12 yrs old
1616550414|5.0|The Legend of Zelda - Hyrule Historia published by Dark Horse Books January 2013 is a magnificent treat for dedicated fans and admirers of the Zelda games. The physical book is, well massive, hardcover 12 by 9 inches; similar to the Collectors Edition Game Guide for the last several Zelda games - but larger.<br /><br />  One section of this book is devoted to the history Hyrule. It is a masterful compendium of the complex and fascinating lore that underpins the games. Not exactly necessary to enjoying game playing but nonetheless essential knowledge no fan could do without.<br /><br />  Another section of this book details each game with a description of the characters accompanied by artistically rendered drawings.<br /><br />  Also provided is a detailed listing of the games, release dates and illustrations of the external packaging.<br /><br />  The publisher, Dark Horse, added a Zelda graphic novel at the end of the book that many fans will, I believe, enjoy.<br /><br />  Now this is not a book of tips and tricks or game walkthroughs. It a celebration of a successful franchise that survived and thrived for over 25 years.<br /><br /> This is an extraordinary book, a Zelda encyclopedia, and I recommend it to all who have ever been captivated by the beauty and creativity of these games.
B0044KI79S|4.0|I personally think Supernatural should have ended with season 5 as originally intended. But it didn't and now we have this. The season was good, The apocalypse is hard to follow but I think this season made a valiant effort.
B001AU8ZLK|1.0|As a longtime fan of Coldplay I have feared the release of this album as soon as I finished listening to X&Y.  That's not to say that I feared the release of an album named Viva La Vida or that I knew the next album would contain the songs that this album does, but each subsequent Coldplay album since their debut has traveled further and further from the magical, melodic and brave tunes heard on Parachutes.  Where earlier releases in Coldplay's catalogue focused on gentle, open arrangements and melodies, the newer releases trade much of that in for safer, radio-ready loops.  For example, Yellow was a hit single for the group but featured a risky, almost heavy chord progression in the chorus.  This made the song appeal to listeners of all backgrounds as it exhibited mastery of melody and dynamic and truly melded pop and rock sensibilities.  Now, however, songs like Lost! and Viva La Vida just seem like formulaic cash-ins or built to order music for the masses.  Gone are the beautiful guitar tones, lonely falsetto vocals, and (most importantly) dynamic space presented on Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head.  Those elements are now replaced by cheesy synths, handclaps, and at least fifty vocal tracks all singing the now standard &#34;Whooooaaaa-oh-oh!&#34; chorus.  These tracks function well as background music as there is nothing outright offensive about the instruments or arrangement, but when you really sit down and listen to the tracks you will be sorely disappointed with how little depth there is to the content, be it musically, lyrically, or dynamically.  If the dynamic of the earlier material were charted on a line graph, it would resemble a roller coaster with exciting crescendos and tranquil pauses whereas the graph of the new material is simply a thick, straight line.  Every sonic space in this new recording is filled to the brim with excess synths and vocals, leaving the dynamic with nowhere to go.<br />In summation, this album is, above all else, a divisive entry into Coldplay's catalogue.  Fans of Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head will be sorely disappointed with how shallow and pandering this album is, while fans of this album will be confused and bored with the earlier material.  The bottom line is that Coldplay has left it's fanbase behind, seeking a more generic sound that I fear will lead to it's (dare I say timely?) demise.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|This was a great purchase especially at this price. Although I don't believe it will stay so cheap. The picture and sound are both amazing and all the extras are quite fun and interesting. Usually way to overpriced but I thankfully got an amazing deal.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This was my husband's favorite childhood movie and I couldn't find it anywhere so I thought I would look on Amazon but most the ones I found were around $50! That was too much for just a movie. Then I found it from here and it was new and in the package for only $15. I was so excited and my husband said it was the best birthday present ever. Thanks so much for the resonable pricing and the quick shipping :)
B007A2O3FO|4.0|This is a fantasy type story.  It was good and held my interest.  I would just recommend that you have a box of Kleenex ready at the end,
B00992CF6W|5.0|great awesome game though need 0.6.0 for kindle pleaseeeeeeeee tell me how fjdj wjs k dkhsj s d kxjs jz end ensnare sjs?
B008GXHOFW|2.0|I downloaded the app but was required to download additional products prior to my son being able to play the game.  I just deleted  it from my kindle and was out the money I paid for it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this game is so much better than the original temple run. I just can't put it down I hope you will injoy it as much as I do.
B00846REIS|5.0|Good read for those who enjoyed 50 shades. The characters stories are more deep. A bit vulgar but interesting story line.
0061537969|5.0|I had heard of this novel since last year and my friend Betty from our Faculty Book Club recently chose it.  I was very excited to begin and the very first chapter captured my interest and like a dog with a bone, never let me go!  It definitely had something to do with the narrator-Enzo.  The dog.  He was such a self-actualized being that I wanted to spend as much time with him as possible.  He says, \\"I've always felt almost human.  I've always known that there's something about me that's different than other dogs.  Sure, I'm stuffed into a dog's body, but that's just a shell. It's what's inside that's important.\\" (page 2)  Such deep thoughts.  Enzo's partner is Dennis or Denny as Enzo calls him.  He's a race car driver.  He has to work at a BMW service department, but he wants to drive full time.  Enzo opens himself up to learning all he can about racing in and out of the rain.  He shares, \\"He [Denny]  says racing is doing.  It is being a part of a moment and being aware of nothing else but that moment.  Reflection must come at a later time.\\" (page 14).  Enzo spends much of the book reflecting on birth, death, and everything in between.<br /><br />You can tell that this pair has a very close relationship and it only grows (with time and that reflection) when Denny falls in love with Eve, marries her, and then has a daughter.  How does one navigate the slippery road of life while trying to balance being an adult and one's dreams?  Enzo has so many thoughts and theories about this conundrum, but alas, he can't speak.  He pointedly adds that things would be so much easier if he was able to be outfitted with a voice synthesizer like Stephen Hawking.<br /><br />This novel opened up so many doors of thought for me.  It's not totally complicated, but it focused in on the complexities of life as seen through the eyes of Enzo.  He was wise and profound.  My friends who have read the novel say two things: It's great and it's sad.  I found that they were absolutely right.<br/><br />\\". . . that which we manifest is before us; we are the creators of our own destiny.  Be it through intention or ignorance, our successes, and our failures have been brought on by none other than ourselves.\\" (page 43)  Enzo manifests his destiny and you must read this book to find out how.  He, like my own beloved Daisy dog (in all of her 100+ lbs and one brown eye and one blue eye majesty), are sorely missed but never forgotten.
1616550414|5.0|I'm a pretty laid back person, I don't really get excited about too many things. I get excited about The Legend of Zelda. When I first learned that this book existed the first thing I did was pre-order it. There was just no way I could not have this book in my possession. In all reality this book could've just been a bunch of sketches of Link in different poses and I still would've bought it. The content in this book is amazing from all the character sketches, details that went into creating the worlds in the games and the layout of the chronology of the games being the best part of the book. This book actually makes me happy in a way that few things can. This includes both my family and my girlfriend. Sorry guys and babe.<br /><br />This is one of the best things I've ever purchased and you better believe I'm going to do whatever I can to keep this book in its best condition for as long as my body converts oxygen into carbon dioxide (if that's even right). Thank you Nintendo and Shigeru Miyamoto for creating one of the greatest franchises in the history of mankind. For even giving this book the chance to exist.<br /><br />Alright, back to seclusion.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so much fun. It is wayyyy better then the first Temple Run.  Its a must have lol. In my opinion it is also a lot easier then the original. im so glad they came out with this for Kindle Fire.

0307352153|4.0|\\"Quiet\\" is a scientifically well-researched book about introverts. Although people fall along a spectrum from introversion to extroversion, balancing both temperaments in different situations is an important part of living life.  In addition, being aware of how they both operate will help people appreciate each other. Temperament may be innate, but environment may also influence the extent of one's temperament.  Cain adeptly discusses the emphasis western cultures place towards extroversion, but reveals empirically how introversion is beneficial, especially in leadership. The author also helps introverts understand their communication styles and helps parents understand their children who may lean toward introversion.  Many people have built-in stereotypes about introverts; thus, I would recommend this book for all people to read in order to understand introverts, who have often been misunderstood.<br />I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Better gameplay than the original. It still has the feel of the first one but has some creative additions that make it even more fun. My only complaint is that it doesn't respond as well when I tilt my Kindle, which has caused me to fall off many cliffs.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I did not enjoy this movie at all.  I thought the plot was pretty bad and the jokes were mediocre.
0345803485|2.0|This is a book of the life of Anastasia Steele who is probably the only woman who, at 21, has never seen any controversial material nor had any blushing moments. She goes to interview a young entrepreneur named Christian Grey who, unlike Miss Steele, would probably best be compared to Charlie Sheen in how experienced he leads the reader to believe he is. As the story continues one is left with the concept that Grey is nothing but a rich snob that finds no happiness unless he is in power but at the same time he just this little wimp who is seeking approval from a very stupid, naïve, shy, young lady in Ms. Steele who at the end of the story comes across as a nymphomaniac. He's supposedly a billionaire CEO yet all he can do is repeat the same phrases over and over again just as Ana does.<br />I found this book to be rather boring, It's poorly written: the author is constantly repeating herself. Yes, apparently Christian is hot. We get it. I don't need constant reminding about how sculptured his lips are or how his pants hang from his hips in whatever way. There are so many repetitions of how lovely his face is, how turned on Ana is, how he wants to bite her lip (hello? He bites it so much how can she even apologize to him?) Not to mention the annoying inner goddess constantly speaking and/or acting, subconscious speaking and/or snapping, and Mrs. Robinson. It's written at maybe a 5th grade level with occasional instances where the author abuses her thesaurus and ends up making somewhat incomprehensible sentences. But typically she is repeating these phrases over and over again:<br />1) holy f***<br />2) holy c***<br />3) holy s***<br />4) stop biting your lip you know what that does to me<br />5) laters, babe<br />6) Oh My<br />7) smirks<br />8) mutters<br />9) blush<br />10) crimson
B003FVI2KQ|4.0|I switched to 6 core Phenom 1090T from 2 core Phenom 550. I was hoping for bigger performance boost in photo editing. There was a boost, but not as big as benchmarks would suggest.<br /><br />What more, the CPU makes a high-pitched squeaking sound under heavy load. Can't eliminate that. And yes, it's definitely the CPU, not the cooling, not the motherboard coils, not the PSU. Noise comes from Phenom X6 1090T itself.
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|My favorite trio of fast action and sci fi movies are Terminator and its sequals. They are fun to watch.

0345803485|1.0|Ladies, if you want to find soft porn there has to be better stuff on the internet or in a Harlequin romance novel.  I got the book because of all the hoopla & a couple of my friends got a little passionate reading it, but I couldn't get past that fact that I was using my time to read poor writing.  For example, the author repeatedly uses the phrase &#34;clamber up to xyz&#34; &#34; to describe getting from point A to B, to the point of me saying aloud &#34;get a frickin' thesaurus, PLEASE!&#34;.  And how many times do we need to hear how good this dude looks?  We get it, he's hot, but what does he see in you other than a malleable co-ed?  I'm thrilled that this trilogy is selling books, but people, please, there are SO many good books to spend time reading.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|My favorite trio of fast action and sci fi movies are Terminator and its sequals. They are fun to watch
B0000013GT|5.0|On \\"Atliens\\", Outkast are at their peak. Their debut was good but it didn't have the flow that this album has. From start to finish, there aren't any weak tracks. Both Big Boi and Andre are amazing with their delivery and their guests don't feel like they're making cameos; it all feels like part of the experience.<br /><br />The sound of the music is definitely influenced by Funkadelic, jazz artists, and even has an experimental feel that I haven't heard on many rap albums. The stuff they rhyme about can get really deep and has universal messages. At the same time though, on some tracks the duo rhyme about street life but they try to educate and elevate as they're doing it for the most part.<br /><br />There aren't any bad songs on this, although the remix of Elevators doesn't sound as creative as the original; just some standard hip hop beats. It sounds like both of the guys put their minds and souls into this and it pays off well. Definitely a classic rap album that any fan of hip hop should add to their collection.<br /><br />PS: It gets better with every spin.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|I love te Lord of the Rings trilogy.  They bring back Childhood fantacies of magical places and beings: my imagination brought to lfe.
B009HELT3C|5.0|Sequels usually disappoint. Not this one. A thrill from the start! The young agent K was a delight. So much more than just a young carbon copy. I love time travel stories. They did a great job. Great effects that blended well with the story and the action without taking over.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My family loves this movie and now we can see it whenever we want. Would recomment purchasing this item to anyone.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|If you enjoyed Downton Abbey through the 3 seasons, you should pick up Gosford Park which was written by Julian Fellows and was a precursor to this series.  An insight into the history of how peoples lived and survived in the tale of two worlds under one roof.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved this story! Such a unique story line! A real page turner. Highly recommend reading this and have been telling friends and family to do just that.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was amazing.  I was not expecting them to have to go through the trials again.  What next?  I hate waiting for the next reveal.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|My daughters saw this movie for the first time years ago, and have been wanting a copy every since. I'm glad I waited and got them the directors cut.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I would recommend this book but to start with it was too all over the place for me but after a few chapters I got into it.  I will say that once I start a book I keep going until I finish it.  Really takes a very bad book for me not to completely read it.  I am stubborn that way so I am not sure you can go by my view though it is how I feel.
0765325950|5.0|This book was great just like all the others in the series it will not let you down!  Must read!!
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I bought this soundtrack for my daughter, but found it surprisingly soothing.  It follows the movie with music, which is easy to listen to when working on the computer or simply sippling a glass of wine with friends.  If you have watched the Pride and Prejudice movie (as I have numerous time with my daughters, of course), then this CD is for you.<br /><br />Recommend with 4 stars because I am a male who isn't supposed to say &#34;I love it&#34; for a non-action movie soundtrack. ;-)
B005IQZB14|5.0|Having grown up in the Pacific Northwest, I found this book extremely interesting and<br />descriptive especially of the Three Sister area where we often hiked. (Always wore two shoes).
B000F3T3CS|5.0|This is light-hearted with a very easy-to-watch Netrebko as Adina and a witty and expressive Villazón as Nemorino.  The sergeant and Dottor Dulcamera are fun and there's an obvious bond between the cast and even the orchestra that puts the viewer at ease.<br /><br />I like it, my toddler watches it repeatedly, and my high school students love this performance; it mesmerizes them and isn't so heavy like a Tosca or Turandot, yet still has an aria, \\"Una furtiva lacrima\\" - \\"A stealthy tear\\" (done beautifully) that inspires youth.<br /><br />I can't understand why those who dislike Netrebko so much would buy this DVD.  Is she perfect? No.<br /><br />Does she have most of what makes a good performance? Yes; Netrebko can act, she can sing, she can dance.  She's pretty, she's energetic, and has a joyful expression.  She's not Callas, let's get on with it.  If you're an opera snob then you know what you're in for when you purchase this DVD, it has Netrebko, yes.  She's Russian so no, she wasn't weaned on a romance language.  She's still enjoyable in many ways.  She's called \\"La Bellissima\\" by fans, not \\"La sonorissima\\" or \\"La coloratissima.\\"<br /><br />All in all, very enjoyable even for a native speaker of Italian.
0545403359|5.0|I got this for my nephew. He loves it. It is great for him to read. He had been looking for this book at school.
B00389XV42|5.0|This is such a great show and I wish I had caught it when it aired on television.  This show is a great mix of witty geek out and slick spy comedy.  A great all around show for teens to adults.
1455523550|5.0|Safe Haven started out a little slow and I guessed in the first couple of pages what was going on with Erin/Katie (hey, I'm an author, it's what I do!), but the end had me glued.  Another great book by Nicholas Sparks.
0452289963|5.0|Simple and profound all at the same time.<br />I also recommend getting the book on audio and hearing the author read it.
B009X01ELC|5.0|I got this case for my husband and he loves it.  It does what it said it would.  Sometimes the kindle doesn't want to turn on when the case is opened but for the most part it works great!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I really was looking forward to this one. I heard about it from Whoopi on The View and she highly recommended it. For me, the first pages grabbed a hold of me only to fizzle out to a slow tempo. I had it figured out pretty quickly and it seemed to drag on to get there. Still I stuck with it, wanting to see how it would all end up. Horribly, in my opinion......
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. Every night before bed or every morning I check this app and it is the best. I can't live without it.

B005HSG3TC|3.0|I somewhat like the cover but I don't feel the stand part of it is very stable. I would have to say that it's fine for a first case but I will be looking for something better.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a lot of fun! I would recommend for anyone who loves horses. its pretty easy to use as well.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed all of the books but I am left with a &#34;what happens next&#34; feeling. I wonder if there will be a book 5
0446554995|5.0|I waited a long time for this book and was not disappointed, although the guys, (Preston and Child )gave us several chapters online to sustain us, thank you! I was quite nervous that we were going to lose our Special Agent Pendergast this time, especially when he was so ill and distraught, I won't mention how he fared. Even now I am not sure, it would be a perfect time for him to drift away, but then, there is always mystery on the turn of every corner in his universe. His genteel manners, fiery temper and fortitude are amazing to say the least, somewhat of a quick turnaround on the fore mentioned possible loss. I hope he goes on for a long time, I would miss his dry wit, his loyal friends, Proctor and now his son.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a must read. I didn't want to at first cause I have no ingest in erotica but this book is so much more

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I really like it it is a great game its cool I love it so much one of my favorite
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I really like the game but the quality isn't as good as temple run 1. Also the characters don't look as realistic as they do in the other temple run
B00992CF6W|5.0|IT IS AWESOME AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT IT IS ADDICTIVE<br />MINECRAFT IS THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE TO MAKE TIME FLY BY

0307593525|5.0|A fantastic gift for the &#34;classically-minded&#34;.<br /><br />Not every recipe in any cookbook will be fulfilled, but this is a great gift and addition to any person's (especially your favorite lady - IE. wife, girlfriend or mother), but there are many easy and golden recipes and techniques to be had here.<br /><br />Nicely packaged and easily identifiable as &#34;The Set&#34; to have.
B003Y8YXFS|5.0|IMAGINE, John Lennon's sophomore solo album, finds him in anything but a slump. This album contains some of Lennon's best-loved songs. In many ways, the album is an icon of rock n' roll, a classic, and certainly on the higher end of his solo output. Like PLASTIC ONO BAND before it, IMAGINE helped establish Lennon's individual voice and identity as an artist beyond The Beatles. Perhaps IMAGINE even exceeded its predecessor in its influence on Lennon's post-Beatles public image. Yet IMAGINE is a less rough-around-the-edges album, with more appeal for new or casual Lennon fans as well as the mainstream.<br /><br />The album begins with the legendary track \\"Imagine,\\" Lennon's vision of utopia. Listening bliss...need I say more? Next is \\"Crippled Inside,\\" which (despite the title) is a charming, mock-country critique of the Right. \\"Jealous Guy,\\" a somber and apologetic ballad, plays like a less intense echo of PLASTIC ONO BAND. \\"It's So Hard\\" is a brief, bluesy number. Phil Spector's influence as producer can be felt most strongly in \\"I Don't Want to Be a Soldier, Mama, I Don't Wanna Die.\\" It's a neurotic, wall-of-sound rocker which feels a little excessive at just over six minutes. \\"Gimme Some Truth\\" follows, a catchy protest jam with a great guitar solo by George Harrison. \\"Oh My Love\\" is a poetic breather from the rock, this time written collaboratively with Yoko Ono. \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" is a stabbing piece of criticism, aimed at both Paul McCartney and (Lennon admitted), himself. \\"How?\\" is a quiet, confused self-query. The album closes with the harmonica-tinged, happy-go-lucky love tune \\"Oh Yoko!\\"<br /><br />An excellent, enjoyable album, IMAGINE is essential Lennon. Though not quite on par with PLASTIC ONO BAND, the album comes recommended without doubt. It's sure to satisfy any curious Beatles fans, while also providing repeated enjoyment for long-time lovers of John Lennon.
0060899220|5.0|Excellent read, by the same guy that brings you the TV show on the Travel Channel, Anthony Bourdain. It shows his real side besides just being a world-class chef. A real person with a real story. He is also an excellent writer with a very interesting life.<br /><br />Short book - great read.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|i like it because it has alot more features. lus it also allowes you to buy more upgrades. Just love the gme
0374531269|5.0|Highly recommended!<br /><br />Thoughtful, heartfelt and real, I paused often to realize the empathy of the life these children must live.
B002Q1YDLI|4.0|I read these backwards. I think something borrowed came first, but I read the second one first, which I'm glad I did. I've known people like Darcy (the main character in the book ) . You just want to hate her, but she grows on you.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|I loved the game then suddenly it wont load anymore plz guys fix this I really liked tht game plz fix it I'm begging u :(
B007QPFGJW|4.0|Jo newborn can write a great thriller. I read the snowman so I knew I wouldn't  be disappointed. It is fast paced and hard to put down at the end of the day.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|you should get this app it amazing I like the first part when you slide down the rope and get the coins and also u can get other characters
B0017TYPIG|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this movie, over and over again. Some really classic lines and scenes. Paul Newman does an outstanding job.

0765325950|5.0|Glad we finally got to the end, just wish Robert could've been with us for it. Sanderson did his best I am sure but I am not a fan of his in this series. But if you read the series you have to get this to get to the end... R.I.P. Robert Jordan.
B004HD61KE|4.0|it is another great read by James Rollins. He explains some of the science behind the story. There is enough exciting  explots by the hero and his cast of fellow adventurers
1616550414|5.0|This is a must have for any true Zelda fan. The information is simply amazing. I can't even handle the excitement I had when I first opened the package to see this sexy beast of a book (partially because my text notification ring tone is the small item catch and went off when I opened the box). I can't even describe how amazing this book is.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I feel that this is a great way to keep under control when you are stressed out and its just plain fun!

0142419400|5.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK SO HARD! It's such a great angsty romance story. Anna is a great narrator - she has some issues, but she's fun and funny and not annoying at all. St Clair is such a great love interest, and I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN. I stayed up until 2:30am reading it in one voracious gulp.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is the coolest game ever in the history of earth.2 days ago I couldn't stop playing it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I haven't enjoyed a series as much in a very long time, it is refreshing to think someone can still produce a series that is worth taking the time to watch.
B004HD61KE|4.0|Entertaining and Informative. This book keeps me looking up other books that James Rollins recommended in the appendix that he used in writing the book.
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|I was so excited about this book, but found it to be a let down.  Not a terrible read, but I found the ending predictable and disapointing.

B00A11AN6O|5.0|I love amazon and I love the free cloud storage.  I plan on buying more.  It amaze me that I had 5GB of photos and movies but I filled it in no time flat.  Great service and feature.  BIG Fan.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|The actual episodes are great...as always.  However, I bought the episodes so they would stream to play on my computer.  This gets frustrating when the connection is weak because it has to pause several times, so make sure you have a really good Internet connection/speed.
098555780X|5.0|This book has everything! Isn't it ridiculous how you have to enter a minmum amount of words to give a product review. Makes you not want to leave a review.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I was hoping for a real page turner, but this book just drug on and on...<br />Plodding and cumbersome at a snails pace.<br />Actually, I didn't finish it half way through I went to another book...
B000FC2PKG|5.0|Good! Isn't it ridiculous how you have to enter a minmum amount of words to give a product review. Makes you not want to leave a review.
B00A1AD6ZU|5.0|Hundreds of mummifies bodies are found deep inside a cave in the rockies. The Native American activist claim the rights to the bodies although the dress was Native the features seemed to be Caucasian. Found with the bodies were plates of gold, with writing that seemed to be ancient Hebrew.<br />An act gone bad sets off a chain reaction that has global consequences, one that could end the world as we know it.<br />This was a good story line combining science, fiction and history in a good balance and exciting story line.<br />Nano technology is the new science yet in fact Damascus blades do in fact contain nano-wires and nano carbon tubes, meaning there was a change in the molecular structure that still has not been duplicated today.<br />The portrait of the Declaration of Independence does not contain all 56 signers, but does in fact include several that did not sign the document.<br />Meriwether Lewis did die as described, ruled suicide. The one official inquire ruled it murder.The family tried on several occasions to have the body examined by forensic scientist but has been denied by the state dept.<br />Recent DNA test on Native American remains finds a strand not linked to Asia as one might expect but to Hiberia, which is present day France.<br />So perhaps some of the secrets that the story line aims at arent so far fetched as one might imagine.<br />All in all this was a good read.
B005LAII0I|5.0|I loved Mirror Mirror, I thought it was a very well done movie. Especially with the casting of Julia Roberts as the queen....The fact that it was a little bit of a different take on Snow White was also interesting. Lily Collins played Snow White very well. Very well made. One thing that bothered me-Prince Valentia & Snow White seemed to have no interest in each other after she kisses him. Aren't they supposed to be in love?
0765325950|5.0|I loved every minute of this book reading it in a single day, I felt it many parts were done perfectly and a few were tied up just a bit to quickly.  I'd have liked to see some areas get a little more background and writing time (I think this could have easily included one more book without overdoing it), however I also understand that Brandon had to meet both publishers and Harriet's timelines as well as making sure that what he wrote would fit with the parts for this book written by Robert.  Given those constraints I believe that Brandon did an amazing job bringing this all together and tying up most of the loose ends.  So much room left after this point, I hope stories in the future of this world are able to tie up some of these loose ends.
B004B63M1S|5.0|Do you want to invite your buddies over to the man cave for a good movie?  Buy a few cases of beer and pop this movie in for a crazy ride.<br /><br />Top notch, grade A quality movie.  It should have been nominated for an Oscar.....ok, ok, maybe that is going a little too far.<br /><br />Buy it and you won't be disappointed!<br /><br />....and while you are at it get &#34;Planet Terror&#34; and &#34;Death Proof&#34; for a trilogy of blood, gore and good laughs.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Kinda slow but decent not hard to play good for small children and to pass the time could be a bit better
B008EQIEWS|3.0|Action, action and action but somewhat predicable.  Acting is good.  I have watched at least 3 times now and still enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this game.  I love the mine.  The new characters are awesome.  Doesn't seem to cause any problems with the kindle fire.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|Unique store that was an enoyable watch.  Good acting.  May be better for instant video instead of buying to see multiple times.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|Dear Sir, the Prometeus edition has two bigh flaws:<br />The information indicates Spanish sound but it is Latin Spanish no Castellian Spanish so the sound is a deception in Spain.<br /><br />Also the digital copy doen't work outside USA so one of the version provides in the boxset is useless.
B004KPX5GC|4.0|Good family movie... good feeling story.  Acting good, somewhat predicable but nice movie on great story in sports and horse racing.  Story was just as much about the strength and perseverance of the woman owner as well as Secretariat himself.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|At first I thought I was going to finish the whole game in a few hours, then it got more difficult and I'm still loving the challenge of it!
B008M36EEI|4.0|Excellent acting, some parts predictable ... good movie family can watch.  Not one I need to see multiple times -- so good instant video selection.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Often times in technology, we find ourselves getting bogged down in details and complexity piled on top of more complexity.<br /><br />Aside from this being a very well written story without the underlying technical pieces, where the book really shines is how it uses the story to add context to what otherwise could be difficult points to grasp.<br /><br />Having the story line offer real time examples of how to consume DevOps principles is invaluable in gaining the insight to understand the fundamental concepts.<br /><br />I think I read this entire book in only two evenings/nights (after very long days at work) because well, ... I could not put it down. =)  I might suggest that you start the book on a Saturday morning because once you start, you may not be able to stop. =)<br /><br />In all seriousness, this book really is required reading for anyone in IT. You will get value from this book if you are in any IT field, including management.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|Among so many artists/bands going with the flow, alt-J is really something original and unique. I haven't been too excited about too many new bands in recent years, but this album is worth getting excited about.
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Finished this book in about 2 days. Starting the program this week. Very excited to try the routines that have been laid out with the nutrition advice.
B0086700CM|5.0|Awesome game ever. I love it. I love the energy. The hunt of the game. This dude is awesome, lol
B004EPZ034|5.0|My 2 year old LOVES this movie!!  He laughs hysterically when he watches it and it is his favorite movie!!  I have bought this for friends kids also.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My girls really enjoys is game, it keeps them busy and i enjoy it too. Not that good with all the jumping and ducking
B005LAIGLO|5.0|La película es interesante el actor excelente caracterizado por un drama social , una realidad de suspenso el combo de
B00280LYIC|5.0|Greatly written book!!<br />Try the other books in the series<br />The last olimpian is my favorite book in the series
B005H0IW6W|5.0|The whole process of purchasing and receiving this item went over flawlessly.  I value peace of mind in my purchases about as much as I value the items themselves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|FANTASTIC a must read along with the other two books well worth buying a real page turner and a real gripper
B00785P2QC|4.0|additive fun, didn't think I would get into it, now cant stop playing it. like how there is always stuff to be done. the one thing I'm not into is posting to facebook. follow on twitter I don't do twitter.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Celebration Day - Led Zeppelin<br />Absolutely awesome, one of the tightest bands ever! What a rush to think of what Jason must of been thinking while jamming with his dad's bandmates!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This product keeps my kids entertained for hours. Holds up well no freezing and works well with my tablet. Thanks
0765325950|5.0|Are words really necessary for this truly amazing and long expected final volume of one of the best fantasy series?
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I love Persona ... story / gameplay is freaking awesome i bought psp vita for this game :) totally worth it
B009E3EYS8|5.0|THE GREATEST!!!! CAN'T GET ENOUGHT OF LED ZEPPELIN... LUV THEM<br />THIS IS AN A+A+. HOPE TO SEE MORE OF THEM
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a great live story. Ok live? That's what sky and holder call their feelings towards each other. Well this book is by far one of the greatest books I've read in a ling time. You just can't help but fall head over hills for holder :)
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I give this book 5 stars.  I could not put it down and cannot wait to start the next book
B006TF6WAM|4.0|A nice heartwarming easy read and a beautiful story. Uplifting and good for the soul! Would highly recommend this book.
B006RXPUR2|1.0|If you're nostalgic for all those elements of Boston - Massachusetts really - that are its very worst, this is the movie for you. One long profanity after another.
B008NEMPTO|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much! It had some scares, cheers and fun all rolled into it!! I highly recommend this movie!!
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|Fantastic!  I watched the first season and had to order the second season right away.  I can't wait to see the third season.
B0001ZXM54|5.0|Loved this double CD that contains so many ZZ Top hits -- \\"La Grange,\\" \\"Sharp Dressed Man,\\" \\"Tush,\\" \\"Cheap Sunglasses,\\" \\"Legs\\" ... you get the idea. I hear this band on the radio from time to time, but there's no substitute for a collection of their greatest hits that you can play one after the other. Great memories! And as the case liner says, \\"Blues, beards 'n' boogie.\\" There also are historical notes on the band's four decades together. Enjoy!
B008CPZNL6|2.0|Almost every article is unreadable on my kindle fire hd. Shows the opening page but tries to link to 100 page renderings and renders none of them! How useless.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Another well crafted novel with Harry Bosch at the center. Bosch doesnt disappoint as a sort of by the book semi retired cop who still burns with making sure justice is served.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I generally can't stand prime time television but I love this show. cliff hangers and drama is so intense like no other show I've ever seen.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was such an eye opening book, I highly recommend it. Thank God for these brave men it affords me the freedom to write this review, we must pay more attention to what our government is doing, read and listen to both sides or someday we won't have the liberties we have today !!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I finished this book in 24 hours it was so good!!! This is one powerful heart warming book! There's not much I can really say about it because I'm still saying...wow!!! I have read a lot of books since getting my kindle a month ago and this is by far the beat one yet!!! I definitely recommend this book for your next read...you won't regret it! I don't care what the people say that gave this a one star rating they are wrong wrong wrong!!! This book deserves nothing less then 5 stars!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Does he do anything badly ? I so enjoy his work, this was a great story, I definitely recommend this book
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This book was great, you can never find a great place to stood keeps you on your toes. I would recommend this book to people of any age or gender
B00ADS90EQ|4.0|It's pretty funny. Not too much &#34;over-the-top&#34; slap-stick humor, which is why I gave it only 4 stars. Really liked the &#34;80's&#34; references. ;)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is great!!!!! I can't stop playing it's so addictive. The horse look real and you really feel like your playing with the horses.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun and entertaining. its cool to see the horses. I just wish that they had a black horse, I use to have one.
0307010856|3.0|I dont know how to rank it. Ask my ex. here is ten more damn stupid words to complete this entry
B004UID2LC|4.0|Great tool for my kids to listen to Worship songs.  They can either search for an artist or a title
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book wherever I went. Suzanne Collins does a brilliant job setting the events in the book. My heart was racing because of the amazing details that were so in depth. It was an absolute thrill to read The Hunger Games.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This is even more fun than the first Temple Run, lots more obstacles to avoid. It has some bugs because once in a while the game closes or it becomes jerky. Once they fix these issues it will be great. I still think it is worth downloading.
1449415881|5.0|What to say?... can't be beat. All the regulars in their wacky (but true) office and personal predicaments. So true it hurts!!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I felt this book wasn't as interesting as the first two.  It appeared another war was about to take place.  Everyone wanted to be involved. The Mockingjay wanted to be in charge . It seemed death was going to overtake everyone.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|I have long thought that there are no accidents in life. Even the smallest occurrences can have far reaching consequences. Mr. Gladwell has explained that so well in this book. I was amazed at so many of the things that seem like just a coincidence, are very important to a person's future.<br /><br />I was hooked from the very beginning. My only disappointment is that I can't lend it to my husband. (Kindle edition)
B00992CF6W|3.0|You can't even get into chests or oven or stuff like that. It's really annoying. But it's still fun to play for other reasons.
B0041KVW2K|1.0|I didn't want to deal with it anymore.  From a VERY NOISY (on BOTH sides) \\"Abbey Road,\\" to a loud sounding glitch on the opening cut of \\"Revolver,\\" to a SKIP on the title track of \\"Magical Mystery Tour,\\" I gave up on the boxed set.  Please note that I clean all of my new records with The Disc Doctor's Miracle Record Cleaner followed by a distilled water rinse on my Nitty Gritty record cleaning machine.  Anyway, to make matters even worse, I had to pay $68.40 USPS Priority Mail from Honolulu back to Amazon!  Am I really going to lose money for the justified return of a defective product?  Sean Magee's mastering is excellent, however, as is the enclosed hardcover book!  Rainbo Record's pressings in my set ranged from very good to a disaster, however.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Crazy, interesting, unexpected. Very enjoyable yet insane. Recommended. She is also the author of my next book I just downloaded!
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|Mansfield Park is a very good that movie my husband and I have watched two or three times since receiving it.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|I am a fan of the Sparks books and movies but I found this one a little too predictable. It reminded me a lot of the movie &#34;Enough&#34; with Jennifer Lopez. I would recommend it if the predictability doesn't bother you.
0316044695|5.0|This an excellent, well written book.  The first half deals with the author's childhood and SEAL training.  Don't start reading the last half unless you have a lot of time because you won't want to stop until you reach the end.  Obviously the author survives but what he and his team go through is as good a read as it gets.  There are no words that can make you understand what combat is really like if you haven't actually been there but this comes closer than most.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Loved the free version  and the paid for version is even better. Bought the Pro version to repay their efforts in making a very useful app.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Don't compare the two movies.  This is a SciFi &#34;B&#34; movie.  Watch it for what it is, not for what it isn't.  The special effects are well done.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I've carried a flashlight for many years.  This is a very good and durable holster. This is a spare one to have on hand for when when I eventually wear out the existing one. I carry a tactical flashlight that has a larger diameter than a flashlight that uses AA batteries, and as a result It sometimes will catch it on something that would tear or destroy some holsters. This one has a breakaway feature that separates the holster from the belt clip and is easy to reattach if that should happen. It can hold a flashlight from the AA type all the way to a D cell if needed. And the price is certainly a good one.
B0014EAN8K|4.0|Women in tight black uniforrms and zombies?  Big guns and explosions?  What's not to like.  Sit back and enjoy the action and forget about the world for a couple of hours.  It's entertainment, not Shakespeare.
B000FBJHT4|5.0|If you've ever wanted to know what really happend and what we're not being told about, it's in here. Very believable and credible soudning witness to things our Gov repeatedly deny. It's a MUST READ.
B00ARN0YDS|2.0|I was disappointed by this movie.  I really enjoyed 1 and 2 (missed 3), but 4 was dull and un-scary.  There was too much screen time of just looking at empty rooms.  I would not recommend this particular movie.
B009DT9DBQ|5.0|This is one of the best live performances I have ever heard on a record. The DVD and Blueray were awesome too! I could imagine that the LP record of this concert will be worth a lot some day.
0767817664|5.0|This is a well done horror movie. I feel its much better than the remake, and has a surprise that most people may have forgotten. Sure, you have Roddy McDowl as Peter Vincent, but take a look at the female lead in this movie, and then take a look at Married with Children. You'll see what I mean then.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The material is so fresh and interesting and the story unfolds without flagging. Clearly a great deal of thought went into the planning of the book. People are very complex and as they get older they get more so. I found the unveiling of the personalities of the characters under the stress of the situation fascinating. I can highly recommend the book to anybody who likes a good mystery story.
B00000K2UX|5.0|I've always enjoyed Top Gun. I even had the soundtrack on cassette tape years ago. Now I have the CD and can listen to it whenever I want to.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|A top notch film . Both Pierce and Rene Russo  are excellent  in  the lead roles. Excellent plot  as Pierce Brosnan Is little bit a crook but not really he just enjoys the Challege. He seduces Rene Russo and they fall in love but  she is tough love  despite all cool things they do together. I recommend  buy even if you have seen it before.
0321525655|5.0|really good book on presentations. but you kinda have to be into this kind of stuff to enjoy it. its an easy read, this is a \\"self help book\\"
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great movie...all the suspense and sci-fi you could ask for....special effects grade A..computers have come a long way from my day...5 stars
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|Great Show...can't wait till season 2 comes out. Very twisted of course but a much needed horror show in a day and age of reality show garbage.
B0053O89U6|5.0|This item was shipped and arrived within two days. I was so surprised! I love the show and I loved the service I received!
B0080YGZ20|3.0|I think Kimbra is a very talented artist.  But, this album is all over the place.  From bubble gum pop music to bluesie.  I really enjoy 1/2 the songs on the album, 1/4 I listen to, and the last 1/4 I skip.
B00AWTTUHI|5.0|WOW... DKR2 is a comic lover's fantasy with super-heroes and super-villains in spades, all set within an ever-so-subtle alternate reality (best for fantasy of this type).  Be aware, this isn't the lithe batman we're used to; he's big, bulky, over-the-hill and moreover Robin is a feisty, teenage girl.  Also, the events in Gotham play out as rather minor in the context of international war and there's a cataclysmic point (which I won't disclose) when things get absolutely epic, the final battle is unexpected and exciting and by the end I was truly amazed.<br /><br />DC Entertainment in conjunction with Warner Bros. Animation Studios has developed (in my opinion) a completely unique look artistically, wholly independent from any Japanese animation studios and head-and-shoulders above anything Marvel is cranking out while stylistically they seem to have sort of a film-noir feel to them.  Also, I believe their stories typically have a slightly more intellectual appeal; for example this film has an underlying subtext of exploring hero/villain archetypes such as Batman as an incarnation of violent justice in contrast to the psychopathic Joker who views humanity as a whole with contempt and probably only finds meaning via his arch-nemesis.  The Dark Knight Returns 2 demonstrates again just how phenomenal W.B. Animation Studios is and takes the potential of traditional animation entertainment to a new level.  :o)
B005HSG3TC|4.0|The construction and functionality of the cover is top shelf.  It seems to be very durable but I am not going to drop my Kindle to test it.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|Fun movie and some good lessons too.  We watch it just about every year and still laugh and enjoy the movie.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Game is a great sequal to first temple run. Graphics are great. Power ups are fun.  My only complaint is that it is not as responsive to swipes as in first game.  I have TR2 on both Samsung Galaxy S3 and ipod and both are missing swipes cause my to lose.  Hopefully the updates with take care of that.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|Just loaded the app because of the price, nothing special.  Don't really use it much, but it works every time.
B00005NB8K|4.0|Yea, this movie wasn't as fun to watch whe your 37 as it was when you were 18. I guess enough said...  The actors did a good job though.  The guy that played Jim Morrison in the movie was just as hot now to me as he was back in the day when I watched it.  Good job on being sexy Jim Morrison man!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Fun game to play and nice graphics. Smooth gameplay and different opstacles to overcome. Overall a good sequel that will fill your free time nicely
B0034G4OYA|5.0|Yea, this movie is just awesome... there's not really anything bad I can say about it.  I can't imagine anyone giving this movie less than 5 stars.  Instant classic.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I purchased this DVD mostly for my 4-year old grandson. We watched it together and we both loved it!  Lots of laughs, and a cute story line.
