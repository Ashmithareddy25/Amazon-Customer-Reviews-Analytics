B005LAII9O|1.0|Oliver Stone is one of my favorite directors. Many of his films rank among my favorite. That said- this is TERRIBLE. One of the worst films I have ever seen. The acting is terrible. Especially Blake Lively. The premise is great, yet the overall story ends up being horrific in the terms of how bad it is. It doesn't even look or feel like an Oliver Stone film. He must have really phoned this one in. I've seen better movies than this on episodes of MST3K. Avoid this like the plague.
B0090YHSFC|3.0|it's. an okay game that plays and looks fine on my kindle - the concept is easy, slice the ice - but in reality you spend your time watching penguins sliding around and waiting for them to bunch up - once you throw in the seals it gets annoying. I don't like games that test my patience and frustration level - this is what I have kids for!!!!

0142419400|5.0|I ended up deciding to re-read Anna and The French Kiss and I am so incredibly happy I did!<br /><br />This book was both funnier and even cuter the second time I read it (if that's even possible :D) Anna is such an amazing main character and St.Clair, well, is amazing....*sighs dreamily*. The plot is so intense and I found myself rooting for Anna and St.Clair every single step of the way. Anna was really relatable to me and the whole story actually seemed pretty realistic, like it could happen.<br /><br />The writing style is also so great. I found myself laughing at different lines and going aww at others.  The thing that I really liked about this book was how everything that happens makes perfect sense, and the characters all build up their relationships over time. From Anna's love for movies to St.Clair's hair (that rhymes ;), everything about this book was so cute and original. I'd give it five out of five flowers.

B00A7OFVVM|5.0|I have read reviews online where people are disappointed in the subject matter of this season. I however have enjoyed this season mostly for the subject matter. The mention of Project Paper Clip had me jumping up off the couch, then I wondered how many people don't know this is an actual program that existed. The fact that they portray Dr. Arden as a Nazi doctor is another interesting part of this season because it ties right in with what Project Paper Clip was about. The experiments done at this asylum are exactly what was done back in the day at such places and esp in Nazi Germany in concentration camps with Nazi doctors. It's almost like Arden is their Mengele of the show, that is at least how I see it.<br /><br />Next we have alien abduction and grey aliens doing experiments on women. That part made me jump as well since there are numerous accounts of women saying the same things have happened to them. As a believer of aliens and abduction experiments this again isnt' far off. Now we have the psychiatrist who turns out to be bloodyface! Wow, didn't see that one coming for sure. The season is getting more and more interesting for me at least because of the subject matter and my interest in such topics. I highly suggest watchers google Project Paper Clip and Nazi experiments along with alien abduction and experimentation. Also look into Asylum's of that time period and the kind of treatments they used on people. The treatments they use in the show are what they actually did to people back then. I know many think it's all made up but i remember reading something the creator or writer (cant remember which) of the show said. He said the story lines would be based on things that have happened in such places and that other topics mentioned will also be ones that have truth to them. I myself was super excited to see the alien twist, something I never expected in this show.<br /><br />I think my interest in this season is my knowledge and interest in the subject matter used.<br /><br />If you are doubting the show please look into these topics it will change your view!! It will make it all the more real to you!sed.<br /><br />If you are doubting the show please look into these topics it will change your view!! It will make it all the more real to you!

The rest of the album was flashy and overrated-to say the least. Also, far too auto-tuned. Blech.<br />Doesn't live up to the hype.<br />2/5.<br /><br />Other Albums:<br />1.Christina Aguilera(debut Album). 5/5. Sets the precedent.Not a bad song on this album.<br />2.Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits. 3/5. Basically a review. With 2 newer songs. A revamped version of Genie in a bottle and the extraordinary \\"Keeps Getting Better\\".<br />3.Stripped.3/5. (REALLY)Good songs(in my opinion):Fighter,Beautiful,Soar,The Voice Within,Keep on singin my song.<br />4. Back to Basics.5/5. 2 discs of Pure awesome. \\"Makes me wanna Pray\\",\\"Ain't No other Man\\",\\"Here to Stay\\",\\"Welcome\\",\\"I got Trouble\\",\\"Hurt\\". and many many more.<br />5.Bionic.2/5. REALLY Great Songs:\\"Lift me up\\",\\"Stronger than Ever\\". \\"Not myself tonight\\" originally good but now often skipped.<br />6.Mi Reflejo.5/5. And I don't understand a word she's saying in songs other than \\"Genio Atrapado\\",\\"Por Siempre Tu\\" and \\"Mi reflejo\\". Also, really enjoy \\"Falsas Esperanzas\\".<br />7.Burlesque soundtrack.1/5. Most songs skipped(I only downloaded Xtina's,not a Cher fan) except for \\"Something's Got a Hold on Me\\".<br /><br />My opinion.Don't bash. Hope it helps.

B0083P1QUM|1.0|I downloaded \\"The Bone Bed\\" because I recalled reading an early Cornwell offering in the past and thought she might put together an entertaining page turner. My memory didn't serve me well. Cornwell has some issues that she needs to work out on the psychiatrist's couch instead of throwing them at her readers.<br /><br />Her characters have all of the subtlety of Macy's Thanksgiving Parade floats; her protagonist Kay Scarpetta is not only a Medical Examiner, but an attorney and an Army Major who never served in combat. Scarpetta's lesbian niece Lucy is some sort of uber-genius computer hacker, renegade FBI investigator and daredevil helicopter pilot. It's a slicer! A dicer! It even makes Julienne fries! Much like the late night product info-mercials, her female characters can do everything except have flaws like normal mortals.<br /><br />The flaws all pile up on the male sub-characters; Pete Marino is a drunken loudmouth and socially incompetent detective who almost sleeps at Scarpetta's feet at the morgue. Her husband Benton is a one-dimensional shadow figure, dragged out to give Scarpetta someone to talk at. Other male characters want to bed Scarpetta because she's not only attractive, but it would be a professional accomplishment for them to be granted the privilege.<br /><br />The plot is a mishmash of a leatherback turtle, a mummified woman and a severed ear. Good ingredients that never come together in a satisfying main course. If a Stephen King book is a bloody steak with all the trimmings and a Lee Child novel is a hoagie sandwich grabbed while running from bad guys through a foreign airport, then \\"The Bone Bed\\" by Patricia Cornwell is a water cracker, a sprig of parsley and an old dinner mint found between your car seats.<br /><br />Oh, \\"misandry\\" is a word that doesn't come up much. It's the opposite of \\"misogyny\\".

B0083SBJXS|2.0|So first, I want to say that this movie is awesome.  Joss Whedon has outdone himself.<br /><br />However, the DVD in this 2 Disc Set doesn't play on computers.  That means that I can't take it with me on a trip and watch it on my notebook.  I understand that Hollywood is trying prevent piracy (impossible challenge), but by limiting my ability to use their product as I see fit within my legal rights, I deem this product defective.<br /><br />I received it as a gift, so I will be having my gift giver return it to Amazon as defective.<br /><br />Hollywood - stop this stupid abuse of your customers.  This encourages piracy, it doesn't prevent it.  You've enabled people who steal your movie to get more usability out of it than people that pay for it.
B003OF3R0S|4.0|Following the sudden death of original drummer/co-founder James \\"The Rev\\" Sullivan in December of 2009, Avenged Sevenfold were broken-hearted but not discouraged. They soon recruited an even better drummer -- a guy named Mike Portnoy from Dream Theater -- and hurried into the studio to record their fifth album, 2010's \\"Nightmare.\\"<br /><br />A7X definitely wear their influences -- which range from Metallica and Pantera to Queensryche and Judas Priest -- on their sleeves this time around. But nevertheless, they definitely still have some sizeable musical chops and instrumental prowess. And \\"Nightmare\\" also proves that the band's songwriting talents have also improved greatly over the years (they debuted with \\"Sounding The Seventh Trumpet\\" in 2001). They concoct both hard-hitting, mosh-pit-friendly metallic hard rockers and docile, laid back ballads equally as well. For the most part, though, this is a traditional heavy metal/metallic hard rock record, and one that is streaked with thrash, power, and progressive metal influences. (And only occasionally does it dive back into the metalcore sound of old.)<br /><br />The title song begins with a quiet, minor-key intro before Portnoy's explosive, driving double bass drums come thundering in. This is then followed by fiery, crunchy, chugging riffs and some irresistibly nasal-sounding vocal hooks (including a catchy, if very clich&eacute; and Alice Cooper-esque chorus: \\"I am your effing nightmare!\\"). A lengthy, winding, dive-bombing guitar solo is included in this strong set opener, too, and a cool piano speckles its outro. The album then takes a turn towards the metalcore days of old with \\"Welcome To The Family,\\" a clear-cut choice for being the lead-single. It features a deft drum intro, insanely catchy vocal hooks, fist-pumping choruses, Iron Maiden-inspired dual guitar harmonies, and double bass-aided breakdowns. \\"Danger Line\\" has a rhythmic, martial drum beat and some soaring, piercing guitar harmonies in its intro. From there, it soon adopts some thrashy, chugging riffs, and soaring, winding, classical-metal-sounding harmonies. This then flows into a bit of clean crooning, thought-provoking lyrics, and a somber keyboard solo that, subsequently, flows into a winding melodic solo to end.<br /><br />\\"Buried Alive,\\" with its slow, melodic intro that leads into a strong, chugging main riff and chugging breakdowns followed by a part where guitarists Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance trade-off exceptional solos, very closely evokes Metallica's \\"One.\\" (But this should be viewed as a nice homage to one of A7X's biggest influences, not as a simple rip-off.) Add some good lyrics to the mix, and the end result is a song that is a hit-single, but a very epic one at that, as it has unorthodox structuring and a nearly seven-minute long playing time. Next up is the blazing, muscularly-riffed \\"Natural Born Killer,\\" which begins with a brutal, blistering bout of buzzsaw-fast thrash picking before segueing into propulsive, fiery chugging and shredding solos. But this is immediately offset by a tear-jerking, Southern rock-flavored ballad named \\"So Far Away,\\" which just might be the album's pinnacle. (It, too, is a hit-single, and rightfully so!) It is highlighted by exceptional, accomplished clean singing and excellent -- if very depressing -- lyricism. (Its subject matter doesn't directly pertain to The Rev's passing; but -- with lines like \\"Another chapter laid to rest\\" and \\"How do I live without the ones I love?\\" -- it might as well have.) It also features some bluesy melodic soloing, and anthemic, lighter-waving choruses.<br /><br />Then comes another surprisingly heavy and thrashy piece of metalcore called \\"God Hates Us,\\" which is fueled by brisk speed metal riffing, bullying double bass drumming, and a Kirk Hammett-esque solo. Then it's right back to the balladry, though, as the proceeding \\"Victim\\" is another sprawling, Queensryche-ian power ballad that clocks in at seven-and-a-half minutesin length and has huge, infectious choruses. And then there's \\"Tonight The World Dies,\\" which is another ballad with Southern, Lynnyrd Skynnyrd-inspired bluesy melodic leads and acoustic strumming. Unfortunately, after that, \\"Nightmare\\" begins to stumble a little bit. \\"Fiction\\" isn't a bad song by any means, but it should be chalked-up as a misstep on account of being one-too-many a ballad in a row. (Three is kind of a lot.) As a result of this, as well as the use of some so-so (and ever-so syrupy) clean vocals and corny vibes, \\"Fiction\\" is a thoroughly mediocre track, and one that does not add much other than a cool piano line and some nearly-symphonic-sounding synths. But all is well that ends well, and \\"Nightmare\\" ends very well. At eleven-whole minutes in length, \\"Save Me\\" might overstay its welcome, but it is nonetheless a strong set closer, and one that is driven by thunderous double bass and blast beats. It also boasts some faint, haunting orchestral touches, fiery, sinewy, winding guitar leads/solos, and heavy, bruising breakdowns.<br /><br />While not album-of-the-year-worthy, or even a career-defining watershed release (this reviewer is still partial to Avenged Sevenfold's 2003 effort, \\"Waking The Fallen\\"), \\"Nightmare\\" is a very accomplished, well-written, well-rounded, and impeccably-played affair. All of which make it a worthy follow-up to A7X's self-titled 2007 release, and a very solid effort, overall. And had \\"Fiction\\" been scrapped from the record (which it definitely should have been), I probably would have given it a five-star rating.gth and has huge, infectious choruses.

B000O178BY|5.0|Trent Reznor's Nine Inch Nails returned after a six-year hiatus in 2005, with that year's \\"With Teeth.\\" But even if this reviewer was slightly disappointed by that release, he needn't fret about it too much, because Trent's creativity cycle was only just beginning. As such, NIN returned only two years later with a wildly epic and commanding new record called \\"Year Zero.\\"<br /><br />This album has been getting most of its much-buzzed about press from a lyrical standpoint, as it is a concept album detailing the singer's predictions of how this war-torn world will lead to an eventual apocalypse and destruction of mankind. This is new ground for Reznor, who usually spends most of his time on Nine Inch Nails albums attacking organized religion, and encouraging atheism. It is a great, and undeniably scary story he tells, here - and part of what is so frightening about it is that his predictions are all very believable and even distinctly possible. But the record is also of note on a musical standpoint. Trent crafts together sixteen carefully-calculated tunes, here, and they are all comprised of darkly catchy, and often indescribable sonic soundscapes. The end result frequently is a bunch of songs that sound quite danceable, and are always very memorable. They are loaded with NIN's signature heavy bass lines, computer-gone-haywire-esque sound effects, and classically techno-industrial-derived clicks, beeps, cyber-smash, and Ministry-like meticulous, stomping rhythms and ominous vocals.<br /><br />\\"Year Zero\\" opens with \\"Hyperpower!,\\" a very cool, instrumental track consisting of a dexterous, reverberating drum solo from Josh Freeze (of A Perfect Circle fame). Track two (\\"The Beginning Of The End\\") is a terrifically catchy number with rhythmic, staccato beat and memorable lyrics (\\"We think we've climbed so high/Up all the backs we've condemned/This is the beginning of the end,\\" etc.). Two other, obvious highlights of the album's first half are the two lead singles, \\"Survivalism\\" (and \\"Capital G.\\" The latter of these two, with its hooky, staccato beat and vocals, is quite possibly the catchiest thing Trent has ever recorded. It also features really great choruses, as well as some of the album's most straight-forward and memorable lyrics (i.e. \\"I pushed the button and elected him to office/He pushed the button and dropped the bomb.\\") Another is the dance-floor-ready rhythms and memorable, electronic-tinged vocals of the indescribable soundscape that is \\"Vessel.\\" And \\"My Violent Heart,\\" which trades-off spoken word narration (with more noteworthy lyricism) in the verses with climactic, powerful choruses, is another.<br /><br />Working your way through the second half of the album, there are bass-driven numbers like \\"The Warning\\" and \\"Meet Your Master.\\" \\"The Greater Good\\" is also a bass-heavy piece (it is propelled by a huge, fuzzy-sounding electronic bass line); but it also features a simplistic, rock `n' roll-esque drum beat, catchy, repetitive rhythms, and a nice, sweeping piano line. This is a mostly-instrumental track, although it does have some faint and bone-chilling whispers in the background. Other highlights of the second half include the distinctly, very Skinny Puppy-esque \\"The Great Destroyer\\" (which boasts accomplished clean singing) and \\"In This Twilight\\"; and \\"Another Version Of The Truth,\\" which, essentially, plays like a continuation of the 1994 NIN classic \\"Hurt.\\"<br /><br />If you are looking for a slab of heavy industrial metal, you will be sorely disappointed with \\"Year Zero.\\" But if it is richly textured, epic, commanding, encompassing industrial metal that you crave, the album will yield some richly rewarding listening sessions.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|After the cliffhanger ending of the the first book I immidiately downloaded and started this sequel! I was hopeful that this book would be better written than the first but its not. You get the same repetitive phrases over and over (and over!) again but its still a fun, easy  and entertaining read! The characters are mostly likable (although certainly annoying at times) but the story is definitely what kept me reading - I really wanted them to work it out and be together. I would also compare this series to an adult version of the Twilight series - Same overprotective, wealthy, controlling male character and same self-doubting, mousy but sometimes assertive female character who can't possibly understand why Edward/Christian wants her... but the love story is what keeps you turning the pages.<br />All in all, a good read and one I will be quite disappointed to be finished with.

This is pretty intense its about a foot long and about 6 or 8 inches wide. Basically you start reading on the left and at some pt on the right page maybe a new chapter.  I was looking for something with the complete works but I could take to and from work.  This maybe just something to look at...I can't imagine trying to hold this and read.

0446573019|1.0|The seller, Haven's Toys, sold me a book that they represented as a full bookstore version.  They did not indicate it was book club or knockoff version in their description of the book.  These are books which are a much cheaper quality book.  You can tell the book is a book club version the minute you pick it up.  The size and weight are a dead giveaway.  When I saw it in the mailbox I was excited and already planning to start reading it the next day.  Now it is sitting in the give away box.  I don't even want to go through the hassle of returning it.  I chalk it up to just another example of companies out to take my money and give me poor quality in return. If Haven's Toy's does not understand the difference between a bookstore version and the book club version a book, perhaps they need to do some research and learn.  If your looking for a quality full blown book store version of a book, I would recommend that you not buy from Haven's Toys. Finally, I gave them 1 star because the web page won't let me choose zero stars, and no I didn't give them a chance to take the book back.  I don't have the time or patience to pack it up and take it to the Post Office. I am not spending my time to resolve their problems and incompetence.

I like the concept but normally don't have the time to sit and watch the screen waiting for the penguins to clump together.<br /><br />The graphics are simple but well done.<br /><br />What I don't like:<br />This is a nice game concept but after a while you get tired of waiting for the penguins to clear a section of the ice.  Sitting there and waiting for minutes to get an opening to slice the ice is not much fun.<br /><br />Summary:<br />The game starts off as fun but soon you have a lot of penguins who have no intention of getting together on one part of the ice so you can cut it.  Finally your patience wears thin and you would just rather slice penguins than slice the ice.<br /><br />The game is good for a few levels at a time but not a continuous playing game experience as your frustration with the penguins takes over.  I rate it a 3 star game.<br /><br />Size: Uncompressed the app is 9.7 MB.<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* System tools - prevent Kindle from sleeping

B003GK2216|5.0|This is a book that is hard to put down, the author paints a very believable picture of the world before and during World War 1. The difference between the lives of privileged classes and commoners is striking as is the position of women in society at that time. The senselessness of war is vividly portrayed and makes one wonder how there could possibly have been a second world war after the first.

B007REV4T8|5.0|Okay, so the title to my review is expected and stale, but that certainly doesn't describe the 23rd installment in the James Bond series. 50 years on, our secret service spy has never been more thrilling and interesting. It's the perfect film for such a monumental anniversary.<br /><br />Without getting too spoilery, \\"Skyfall\\" has Bond resurrecting himself after a slam bang pre-credits sequence that finds 007's life up in the air. He reports back to duty when someone has attacked MI6. It seems someone has a top secret list that exposes the identities of agents out in the field, and it's someone who hits close to home with M (the amazing Dame Judi Dench).<br /><br />Like many people my age, my introduction to Bond was Roger Moore. That's who I grew up with at first, but got to see Connery on TV and video. Connery was the best (and I have a soft spot for Pierce Brosnan as well), but it took me a while to warm up to Daniel Craig. 'Casino Royale' was a fine film and 'Quantum Of Solace' was a disaster. 'Skyfall' is Craig's third Bond film, but it's the first where it feels like he is finally a Bond that I can warm up to and put him right alongside the others. It's a movie that breaks the mold with 007, but also retains the classic elements of the franchise. It's also those classic moments that had the audience I saw with applauding the most. One only has to watch M's scene defending herself before the Prime Minister and her department to understand why we still need Bond and his services. The classics never go out of style.<br /><br />I cannot stress enough how amazing the movie looks. Cinematograpger Roger Deakins has created the best looking Bond I have ever seen. If an Oscar isn't coming his way for this, then something is very wrong. In fact, the movie is Oscar-worthy in other areas. The music by Thomas Newman is phenomenal. The original stuff fits right in with the series while giving hints of the classic 007 theme here and there before really blaring it in a classic scene. Adele's theme song is one of the best ever. It's a ready made classic and Shirley Bassey-sounding that plays out over one of the best and more impressive opening credits ever. You also have a stellar cast. Javier Bardem as Silva is one of the most memorable villains in a Bond film in decades, possibly ever. He is unsettling. He goes from humorous to downright creepy in a blink of the eye. Truly a memorable presence. Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Albert Finney are also new to the game. We finally get a new Q as well, in the guide of a young computer geek played by Ben Wishaw. However, this is Judi Dench's turn as THE Bond girl of the film. She has more of a part than ever before and she owns this film. It makes one wish they had used her more in her other 6 007 films. And Daniel Craig. He is finally James Bond in this one. Definitely his best. He makes Bond human and vulnerable like never before.<br /><br />\\"Skyfall\\" explores more about Bond's past than we have ever seen in a 007 movie. It does a good job of new revelations in a new age, but also keeps those classic hallmarks that we have all come to know and love in the series. You can't have Bond without them. \\"Skyfall\\" is exceptionally directed by Sam Mednes, who delivers not only one of the best Bond films, but one of the best action films I have seen in years. The stunts are magnificent, the action is breathtaking, the cinematography is beautiful, the music is amazing. \\"Skyfall\\" is Bond at his best.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, very exciting story. I learned a lot about what actually happened and it was different from the official government version. I also learned some insights about how the SEALs operate around the world.
B004ISVH6G|2.0|I absolutely LOVE John Waite and have all of the albums he's ever recorded except for some Babys ones. I even have \\"JW\\" tattooed on my shoulder in honour of the great man!  I'm sorry to say that I was a bit disappointed with this album and there are only maybe 3 songs that I really like and even one that I really dislike.  This album has a bit too much of everything - too many different styles for my liking.  John's voice is still brilliant and I agree that he is one of the most underrated singers of all time.  I will continue to support John and buy his albums but I won't be playing this one too often.  Temple Bar is still my favourite.

B007EE4XKI|5.0|Warning: some spoilers ahead, proceed at your own risk, preferably having already read it:<br /><br />Good?<br /><br />Ok, I definitely saw some parallels between this story (esp the frame story) and STIII.<br /><br />Data obv is Spock, thought dead but his Katra stored in B4's fragile mind.<br /><br />BIG SPOILER: Choudhurry would be David Marcus, killed by the hostage-taking alien baddie for no good reason.<br /><br />I expect at the end of this trilogy, a few other main relaunch characters may meet similar ends, hence the name: Cold Equations.<br /><br />Worf and Geordi pretty much share the Kirk role here, Worf for Choudhurry and Geordi for Data.<br /><br />Writing-wise, I loved it. It gets quickly to the point, bringing you into a scene without the endless parenthetical asides as we pause an action seen to go inside someone's head like we see so often.<br /><br />Mack's writing of Soong is perfect, I can hear Brent Spiner-as-Soong in my head as I read and everything sounds natural.<br /><br />Overall a really nicely written start to the trilogy, and I can't wait to see how everything will fit together at the end.

B009FB3XTA|4.0|I was reading through the reviews, mostly for a recap on when the songs played in the movie (Seems that's not available yet, I'll just have to see the movie again) and I was aghast at the horrible reviews this soundtrack was receiving. \\"I was hoping for upbeat music\\" and \\"Green Day and Ellie Goulding were fun, but the rest sucks\\" seems to be a trending theme. And that's just wrong.<br /><br />No one watches Twilight (or any of the movies following) because it's uplifting. It's a moody book series, it's a moody set of movies. Therefore, you're not going to have Justin Beiber and other crappy upbeat artists on the soundtrack. Sorry. If you're looking for top 20 pop beats, go buy the new NOW CD (if they even still make that garbage).<br /><br />This album has some enchanting, peaceful songs that continue the trend set by earlier albums. I see a direct connection between some of the songs and the New Moon soundtrack that most everyone seemed to enjoy. Feist's song, \\"Fire in the Water,\\" is the best example I see. It's chilling, moving, and thought provoking. And you can't beat Feist's vocals.<br /><br />The most impressive songs to me seem to be the ones no one is talking about on here: Feist \\"Fire in the Water\\", St. Vincent \\"The Antidote\\", and James Vincent McMorrow \\"Ghosts\\". They aren't shallow pop hits, no. But these albums have never been about shallow pop hits. Green Day and Ellie Goulding are, by far, the weak spots in the album.<br /><br />And here's an update on song placement in the movie. WARNING: SOME SPOILERS after this point. I am not 100 percent on some of these, as I only took mental notes while I was watching it. Feel free to correct me if I missed a couple.<br /><br />1.) Passion Pit - Where I Come From: This song plays at the very beginning of the movie, when Bella is seeing the world for the first time as a vampire.<br />2.) Ellie Goulding - Bittersweet: Thankfully, I think this song only plays in the credits.<br />3.) Green Day - The Forgotten: Credits (again, thankfully)<br />4.) Feist - Fire in the Water: Bella and Edward's scene where they... uh... yeah. sexy time.<br />5.) The Boom Circuits - Everything and Nothing: Cullen family returning from the cottage, giving Bella the key.<br />6.) St. Vincent - The Antidote: Bella and Emmett arm wrestle.<br />7.) POP ETC - Speak Up: I think this is the song that plays at the end of the movie when Alice is seeing Renesmee and Jacob's future.<br />8.) Iko - Heart of Stone: Edward and Bella talk in the cottage, Bella realizes Alice's secret message.<br />9.) A Boy and His Kite - Cover Your Tracks: Bella and Edward see the cottage for the first time.<br />10.) James Vincent McMorrow - Ghosts: Bella returns from meeting with J Jenks. Watches Edward with Renesmee.<br />11.) Paul McDonald, Nikki Reed - All I've Ever Needed: Credits, I assume, since I didn't hear it in the movie. Nikki Reed is the actress that plays Rosalie, so it's fitting. And she has a great voice.<br />12.) Reeve Carney - New For You: Not sure where this plays.<br />13.) Christina Perry - A Thousand Years: Last scene of the movie, as well as picture credits.<br />14.) Carter Burwell - Plus Que Ma Prope Vie: Throughout the movie.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|I found once I started reading this book it was hard to stop. There are several stories intertwined in the book and at times it is difficult to see how they will conclude. Being part of a series, the first book ends with so many \\"loose ends\\", there is little choice but to read the second book. I am looking forward to it but I know I will need to have several days with free time to start it because if it's like the first I will want to read it all once I start.<br /><br />However, it may not appeal to everyone. You need to enjoy reading fantasy and accept that there is a lot of intrigue, plotting, foul play and war.
B008BO61BE|5.0|\\"Screaming For Vengeance,\\" the sixth album proper from the almighty English heavy metal quintet Judas Priest, is a resounding success. Although not quite as amazing as 1980's watershed release \\"British Steel,\\" it is still a timeless classic. It is also one of the most influential records of the 1980's, as it would prove to go on to inspire an unquantifiable number of power metal, progressive metal, and thrash/speed metal bands.<br /><br />\\"S.F.V.\\" is full of the heavy metal good stuff. What this means is expect tons of stellar, passionate vocals from frontman Rob Halford, a tight rhythm section -- comprised of Dave Holland's deft, natural-sounding drumming and Ian Hill's steady bass bottom -- and, most importantly, great riffs and even greater solos from axe-duo-extraordinaire Glenn Tipton and K.K. Downing.<br /><br />The record blasts off with \\"The Hellion,\\" an early piece of thrash/speed metal. It is a lightning-fast blitzkrieg of speed punk-ish drumming (including an eight-second long, bouncy, crashing drum solo in the intro), propulsive speed metal riffs, grumbling bass notes, and catchy and commanding vocals. A fist-pumping chorus is also included, and the opener is capped off by both a soaring, several-parted melodic solo and some neat twin-guitar harmonies. \\"Electric Eye, \\"with its hooky, single-note, riff, crashing drum beat, galloping, head-bobbing rhythm, is quite possibly the catchiest song found anywhere on here. And a ripping, classical-sounding guitar solo is also included. \\"Riding On The Wind\\" is another insanely rhythmic head-banger backed by industrial-strength, churning guitar leads, punchy, dexterous drumming, and strong, humming bass line. (And dig the tune's choral interludes, too.)<br /><br />\\"Bloodstone\\"'s crunchy, fiery, machine-gun guitar licks (that come cascading down on the listener's eardrums), galloping, chugging bass line, and soulful, melodic singing make it another standout. It also has a bouncy drum beat that fills any leftover space perfectly well, and, like the riffage, some similarly fiery melodic soloing to end. \\"(Take These) Chains\\" marries a cool, futuristic-sounding intro with strong, propulsive, staccato guitar hooks, and a steady, humming bass bottom. And its chant-worthy sing-along vocals and huge, concert-ready choruses serve as just the icing on the cake. \\"Pain And Pleasure\\" has stellar, power metal-esque vocals (that practically scream \\"classic Halford!\\"), and muscular, churning rhythms. But for the most part, though, this is a bass-driven song; as it features some very interesting and noteworthy bass work throughout. (This includes a funky-sounding bottom-end and some meaty, heavy bass throbs.)<br /><br />The title track may have catchy, shouted vocals, but it is the guitarists that take over the spotlight, here. And they do so with crunching riffs and epic, instinctively memorable, and pyrotechnic soloing. \\"You've Got Another Thing Comin',\\" however, is highlighted by what is perhaps \\"S.F.V.\\"'s best solo -- and what a lengthy, mazy, complex, multi-parted, soulfully emphatic, and wailing solo it is, too. It is classic Judas Priest, through and through. \\"You've Got...,\\" which is a semi-power ballad, is also highlighted by dreamy acoustic guitar melodies, crunchy electric guitars, and piercingly falsetto and harmonic, glass-shattering vocals. And another solo -- this one is of the more blistering, shredding, and wah-drenched variety -- comes ripping through the mix, too.<br /><br />\\"Feber\\" is another cut of early speed metal, as it is a propulsive, lean and mean number with a memorable, pounding main riff, chug and churning rhythms, an adherent, mosh pit-ready groove, and another unorthodox, shredding, whammy bar solo. \\"Devil's Child\\" (which is the proper end of the album) lays gentle acoustic strums and atmospheric keyboards against thudding, throbbing rhythms, thus creating a new-wavy, and borderline -creepy vibe. Some deliciously melodic leads and an acoustic guitar solo help this cause, though, too. Finally, the set wraps up with a bunch of flawlessly-executed live renditions of various songs -- most of which were recorded live at the San Antonio civic center in September of 1982. And a b-side from the 1985 \\"Turbo\\" recording sessions (\\"Prisoner Of Your Eyes\\") is also included as a bonus track.<br /><br />One of the Priest's greatest achievements.s cause, though, too.

B0035KGWR2|5.0|Amy MacDonald is wonderful.  I couldn't find this album on iTunes, so I was pleased to find it on Amazon -- reasonably priced, arrived quickly, and sounds terrific.
B00005UEAR|5.0|The sixth full-length album from New York-based prog metal godfathers/innovators Dream Theater, 2002's \\"Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence,\\" is perhaps the band's most epic release of their storied, influential career. While not as essential as, say, 1992's \\"Images And Words,\\" it is still yet another fine record from D.T.. Comprised of two different discs, \\"Six Degrees\\" sounds like it was made by a bunch of people with bipolar disorder, as it explores both soft, experimental and metallic, hard-hitting territory. It is a conceptual piece, detailing the lives of six individuals suffering from bipolarity, post-traumatic stress, schizophrenia, post-partum depression, autism, and dissociative personality disorder.<br /><br />But \\"Six Degrees\\" is also of note from a musical standpoint -- of course. Guitar god John Petrucci's fretwork is always highly technical and impressive. The drumming of Mike Portnoy, and bass work of John Myung are very good, too, and keyboardist Jordan Rudess is prominently audible in the mix, as well. But for the most part, the music is focused around said axeman --and dang, is it ever great! And instinctively memorable, too. He lays down piles of riffs -- and whether aggressive and heavy or progg-y and melodic, they are always very inventive, technically-proficient, and interesting. And his solos -- my god, his solos! He augments his riffing with mile after mile of equally amazing and wailing solos.<br /><br />Disc one is made up of almost entirely made-up of experimental songs. Almost. The big exception to that is the high-octane opener \\"The Glass Prison,\\" which has three different parts to it: \\"Reflection,\\" \\"Restoration,\\" and \\"Revelation.\\" After an acoustic intro, the dramatic electric guitars come storming onto the scene, with catchy, Dimebag Darrell-esque wah-wah guitar licks backed by mean, driving double bass drumming. And it all forms a crunchy, staccato, head-bangable groove that the song adheres to for the duration of its thirteen-minute playing time. Some very progressive, technical, and sweeping melodic guitar soloing is also included in this powerful set opener, as is a technical, slapped, walking bass solo. And it all wraps up with an excellent, epic, dual-guitar soloing section, with one ripping, whammy-bar-laden solo, and one screaming and winding solo. The ten-and-a-half minute-long \\"Blind Faith\\" brings back some of those impressive soloing skills found in the first track, as Petrucci lays down some great, Slash-esque solo flights. But the song is also highlighted by a flowing melodic bass groove, docile melodic vocals, and a very tricky keyboard solo.<br /><br />\\"Misunderstood\\" might gain momentum and heaviness off of itself, morphing into a thundering bass groove and technical, shredding soloing. But for the most part, though, this is a very dreamy and heavenly, Radiohead-esque synth-driven ballad. (Dig that proggy synth soloing, throughout!) Next, the politically-charged \\"The Great Debate\\" draws influence mostly from Tool and A Perfect Circle. Its James Maynard Keenan-esque vocals really drive-home the track's noteworthy political lyrics; and there are also numerous politically-based samples that are about stem cell research. But \\"Great Debate\\" is also of note on a musical level, too; as it features an excellent, ominous bass intro, proggy, jazzy drumming, keyboard-sounding guitar leads, and another stellar, screaming, wailing melodic solo. The first disc wraps up with \\"Disappear,\\" a very pretty and somber acoustic guitar/synthesizer-driven ballad.<br /><br />The second disc is comprised of one song with six-different parts. Kicking off the second disc is \\"Overture,\\" which fuses in a full orchestra into its mix, thus making this a rich-sounding instrumental opener, and one that is full of gorgeous textures layered on top of each other. \\"About To Crash\\" picks up right where \\"Overture\\" leaves off, augmenting a melodic string arrangement with sweeping, symphonic-sounding piano and keyboard runs.Then, following \\"War Inside My Head\\" (which is seemingly out of place, clocking in at just over two minutes in length), comes \\"The Test That Stumped Them All,\\" which, with its crunching grooves, staccato, chugging riffs, and thundering drum fills, almost plays like a sequel to Pantera's \\"By Demons Be Driven.\\" Other highlights of the second disc include \\"Goodnight Kiss,\\" which opens with dreamy acoustic plucking and has a wealth of wailing keyboard runs, really epic and jazzy guitar soloing, and rhythmically staccato, chunky, beeping bass lines; and the nicely melodic bass work, sweeping, symphonic-sounding keyboards, and insanely tricky and technical acoustic guitar work in the power ballad \\"Solitary Shell.\\"<br /><br />Again, \\"Six Degrees\\" is not Dream Theater's magnum-opus, but it is good enough to warrant being a standout in the band's discography. It is as excellent and rewarding as it is unpredictable, making it one of the best metal releases of 2002, and also one of the best progressive metal albums of the new millennium.Then, following \\"War Inside My Head\\" (which is seemingly out of place, clocking in at just over two minutes in length), comes \\"The Test That Stumped Them All,\\" which, with its crunching grooves, staccato, chugging riffs, and thundering drum fills, almost plays like a sequel to Pantera's \\"By Demons Be Driven.\\" Other highlights of the second disc include \\"Goodnight Kiss,\\" which opens with dreamy acoustic plucking and has a wealth of wailing keyboard runs, really epic and jazzy guitar soloing, and rhythmically staccato, chunky, beeping bass lines; and the nicely melodic bass work, sweeping, symphonic-sounding keyboards, and insanely tricky and technical acoustic guitar work in the power ballad \\"Solitary Shell.\\"<br /><br />Again, \\"Six Degrees\\" is not Dream Theater's magnum-opus, but it is good enough to warrant being a standout in the band's discography.

A thriller \\"Argo,\\" based on true events recorded in recently declassified CIA documents, is one such example. And Hollywood chose a right person to direct it: Ben Affleck, who, after \\"The Town\\" and \\"Gone Baby Gone,\\" once again shows his talent as an accomplished film director.<br /><br />On January 25, 1980, a CIA \\"extractor\\" Tony Mendez traveled to Iran, where about two month before a group of young Islamists invaded the US embassy in Tehran. During the confusion six embassy workers managed to escape the building without being seen by the revolutionary guards, and they took refuge in the private house of Canadian ambassador Ken Taylor, who was well aware of the great risk he was running.<br /><br />Tony Mendez's mission was unique, something that was never done before. Mendez poses as a Canadian producer scouting exotic location for a Hollywood sci-fi film \\"Argo\\" - a film project that does not exist. And he disguises the trapped American embassy workers as Canadian film crew members so that they can get out of Iran safely. This is his \\"best bad idea\\" - but will that \\"bad idea\\" really work?<br /><br />Set in the middle of the Iranian Revolution (of which background is briefly shown in the opening), \\"Argo\\" is a tense and fast-paced thriller that never lets up. With top-notch acting from the cast and vivid details that convey the social climate of the period, \\"Argo\\" is an engrossing experience throughout. Believe me or not, the film is also funny at times.<br /><br />Like most films \\"based on true events,\\" \\"Argo\\" sometimes seems taking liberties with the facts, especially in its second half. Still, with its interesting storyline and suspenseful moments, \\"Argo\\" is a first-rate thriller.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have made this into my note haven.  Diary, christmas lists, things to do - with pics and audio too.  Thanks!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I enjoyed every subtle nuance of this thoughtfully written book. I love flowers and often spend hours photographing them. I also loved that Hazel meant reconciliation. It was my grandmother's name and could not have been more fitting of her character.
1881273563|5.0|My counselor recommended this book for me and my boyfriend. I found it extremely helpful and will use it for reference whenever needed. I bought one for him as well. Unfortunatley....we split up but I learned a great deal... I wonder if he has read it! He needs to read The Five Languages Of Apology too!
B000002ITW|3.0|Growing up in the mid 70's, Crosby Stills Nash (& Young) were my favorite group. The debut Crosby Stills & Nash album, & Deja Vu, were the two most influential albums on me.<br />This one, too, evokes strong memories... but unfortunately, not all positive. There are some great moments here, but there are at least as many major critiques as there are positive things to say about this album.<br />Let's begin with the good. Young, in particular, sparkles. If you were to list the best tracks of this disk, at least 5 of the top 6 would have to be Neil's. From the opening chords of \\"On the Way Home,\\" to the dramatic \\"Ohio\\" (written within days of the Kent State shootings, & performed here only weeks later), Young far outshines his colleagues. Cowgirl in the Sand takes on a haunting quality. Southern Man goes on too long (Young introduces the song by saying \\"this is a really long song, & tonight we are going to play it real slow\\"), but is outstanding. & then there is \\"Ohio,\\" a song that no one over the 10 when it came out can ever forget. The addition of the Loner/Cinnamon Girl/Down by the River medley is by far the best of the bonus tracks.<br />The acoutstic side has a few other nice moments. I have always been a sucker for Crosby's rich voice, and it is on full display in Lee Shore & Triad (even if some of his harmonies with his long time partner Nash are a bit rough on Lee Shore). His Long Time Coming is some great 60's paranoia, well played here.<br />The additions of Black Queen, King Midas in Reverse, and Laughing add some value, but are not particularly notable.<br />For the most part, the acoustic side is comprised of 4 solo artists taking turns. There are a few decent collaborations, but there are at least as many screwups. You can applaud the original producers of the record for leaving Crosby & Nash's false start on \\"Right Between the Eyes\\" for their unflinching honesty, or their attempt to bring a little levity to the proceedings, but frankly these guys oughtto be embarrassed. Most likely, they were so completely high, they screwed up.<br />More negatives:<br />* Nash sounds downright shrill throughout. None of his pieces work. Pre Road Downs in particular is just terrible.<br />* Stills' contrributions are weak as well.<br />* Carry On and Pre Road Downs are simply unlistenable. At least the latter is short: Carry On, perhaps CSNY's 2nd best song (after Suite) might be the worst 14 minutes or so ever recorded. The \\"jam\\" is just terrible.<br />* Why the heck didn't they clean up the recording quality with the release of the CD? Surely something could have been done to improve the just awful sound quality.<br />* Suite Judy Blue Eyes: I still kind of have a soft spot in my heart for the way they sort of seque into the album with just about 30 seconds of Suite Judy Blue Eyes. But especially on re-release, with bonus tracks, why not give us a decent version of CSN's quintessential song? Nash later admitted this was a \\"mistake\\". Why not rectify it now? Eg, drop the OK but completely unnecessary \\"Black Queen\\" (which clocks in at nearly 7 minutes, more than enough time) and replace it with Suite Judy Blue Eyes? Even keeping the opening 30 second intro?<br />Lets finish as the album finishes, with Find the Cost of Freedom. Crosby quiets the crowd, saying \\"this is wooden music now, you've got to be quiet, or else you won't hear it.\\" The song has a hushed quality that lends gravitas to the performance. Even if not every harmony is spot on, the whole of it is far greater than the sum of its parts.<br />I will forever be 16 years old when I listen to this disk. It takes me back to another place in time, and evokes a lot of happy memories for me. I suspect the same will be true for a number of folks in their 50s & 60s. Most people have already decided long ago about this disk. For those handful of folks out there who remained on the fence, go ahead & take the plunge. Yeah, its got warts. So do a lot of folks our age.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|I am very disappointed with my purchase of the 2nd generation Kindle. I found out after i Bought it that it does not support flash player. I have downloaded all the free video apps from the app store as well as purchasing V Player. I still am unable to watch all the videos I want. I purchased the Kindle so as not to have to take my laptop with me all the time when I travel but it appears I may have to go back to it.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I have a good time playing this game, it works for me, for does boring times that you have nothing to do
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read. I saw the movie before reading the book and finally reading the book made the story so much better ready to read the next two.
0440246008|5.0|The Hard Way is one of Lee Child's most exciting, and twist-filled stories. It's not over until the last few pages! Many surprises in store.
B007QPFGJW|1.0|Found it a difficult read. I rarely stop a book once started, but am considering it.Confusing plot. Would not buy one of his books again.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Works very well on my Cruz T408 and T508 tablets.  And also on my OLD smart phone from 4 years ago.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is really fun and the late levels get hard. i love the challenge. the game is especially nice for when you only have a few minutes and need something to do.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Easy to get the book on my Nexus 7. The book is very true sounding. Seems a little slow to get the story started.
B0029XFNA8|3.0|I just purchased the Blu-ray disc of Miracle on 34th Street. The description claims it is colorized yet the film is in the original black and white. That is fine with me personally, but to those who might buy this desiring the colorized version this will likely be upsetting. There is no option to view the film in color and the description is downright false. Anyone who wants to see a blu-ray color version of this classic...this is not it.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really think u should get this game if u like to cook food and act like u r in a restaurant.  Please get<br />this game; it means a lot to me.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|3D effect was well done.  We were waiting for this release for a while now.  We are glad we purchased this version.  Highly recommended for anyone's 3D library.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This is a do not miss series!  One of the best in a long time!  Congratulations Show time!  get it now!
0688023711|5.0|&#34;On Wings of Eagles&#34; is a dynamic, powerful story of a true rescue.  Nothing in fiction touches it for action and excitement.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I needed a simple calculator and this fits the need. The large format is easy on the eyes. The kids love it too.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I find this game is fun for everyone.  It's like I start playing and I can't put the dog gone thing down.  I'm 54 years old & I'm getting called to supper.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It is a great basic calculator! The numbers are large and easy to use and it reminds you what you just entered by showing it below your total. I totally recommend this for anyone of any age!
0446580848|1.0|Although I read a great deal of mystery/thriller literature I hadn't read any demille work in quite some time. I just really couldn't believe how sophomoric the &#34;banter&#34; in this book was. I pushed myself to finish it, even though I found myself skimming large parts of the redundant background information.<br /><br />I don't want to dissect all of the things that I found lacking, both technically (all of the electronics in the SCIF) and/or stylistically (character, plot etc.) but suffice it to say there are serious flaes in both.<br /><br /> In any case, this ranks up there with the top five worst books I've ever read.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|It was a great book and i luved it greatly. The charecters were funny and i loved them also but what i didnt really like all was when Abby wouldnot get back together with travis it took her like a year even though she loved him. i only do book reviews for books that are amazing and books i love.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I'm an avid horror movie fan...that is, if the movie has an intriguing plot...and this movie definitely satisfies that criteria.  It keeps you guessing from beginning to end.  If you're looking for a horror movie that makes you think a little bit and stays with you for days, you'll love \\"Silent Hill\\"!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is good it's highly addictive. sometimes hard but a great challenge. sometimes I get frustrated and just go to another mini game but overall it's a good game.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Great story good action. Wish thatthere were more like this. Wish that i could write so well.  Many happy endings.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, however, the whole submissive/dominant thing doesn't thrill me @ all. It was hard for me to wrap my mind around it. The book all in all was hot as hell and I want myself a Christian Grey.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|The movie had a lot of hype and I think it lived up to the expectations I had due to it.I like it when good and bad are so easily discerned,
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book! Learned a lot about the SEALS and hard they train...and how they are prepared for any assigment.  And they get it DONE!!!!!!!
0891419063|5.0|How sad that such men died before each of us had an opportunity to sit and love on them some as friends. Incredible war story of a terrible war and its most brutal theatre. They were the Greatest Generation!
B001EC3JME|5.0|I work on super yachts which means having the tools of the trade at my finger tips is important. This holster has allowed me to have my torch on me at all times for when i am in those tight spots with limited light, which seems to happen a lot! So its great that i know my torch is secure and ready to go, thank you 'Lite Holster' !! A must buy!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I must confess something about this Alien series both repels me and fascinates me at the same time. It is so disgusting the way the critters exit a human host but seeing Sigourney kick some Alien butt is even better.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gone Girl has an interesting, twisted plot that has the reader attention from the get go.  Love to hate Amy.
B004LROMX4|5.0|This was fun to watch and intriguing.I enjoyed following the characters as they learned to survive and put the hurt on the invaders.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|omg ive been waiting for this app to be on the kindle fire for a long time! its finally here!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I can't think of to many movies I liked more then this one. Its not on the order of LOTR but the multi character carryovers from various other Marvelous dynasties almost lends it a similiar feel.Feel like watching it again just thinking about it as I write.
B005LAII0I|5.0|It was in excellent condition, and would highly recommend purchasing  it ! It arrived in a timely ,manner, and did not have any scratches or skips in it! Yay!
B006WXHJNU|5.0|I just loved this movie! I liked the Hulk so much in The Avengers went and  bought this to catch the beginnings so to speak and was pleasantly surprised.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Arrived on time, excellent condition, very pleased with the product, would definitely recommend purchasing to anyone!! Good movie!!! Can't wait for it to be a boxed set!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie was eagerly anticpated by me and did not disappoint. A great sci-fi prequel laying the foundation for the Alien series, the only thing it lacked was Sigourney fighting the devils spawn. Don't you just hate it when people youv'e grown to love get old. The BluRay was great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like Temple run but a little better. No glitches or errays just hours and hours of fun and enjoyment. Great for the kindle fire screen. Get it now what are u waiting for.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I really enjoy this game even better than the original. It is a great way to pass time.  Most of the puzzles are challenging without being too hard.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This puzzle is fun. Very hard to stop playing.  I would like to admire my work or see how I finally solved the puzzle but the \\"continue to next puzzle\\" screen comes up too fast.  Very little down time between puzzles is a plus in most cases
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is an easy read thriller that is hard to put down.  I like the characters that DeMille developed and look forward to more John Corey books.
0385344333|5.0|I have been following the adventures of Jack Reacher for several years now and Lee Child has never disappointed me.  His books are filled with both intrigue and action; this book is no exception.  If you're looking for a page - turning, good read you could do far worse than giving &#34;A Wanted Man &#34; a try.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|In my opinion, historical fiction needs to be very well researched and Fall of Giants certainly is. However, the danger with thorough research is that it sometimes leads the author to give us an account of history. Conversely, Ken Follett manages to offer us a true novel with love, hatred, friendship, death, hopes and dreams. The characters are as well researched as the history and they feel incredibly real. Furthermore, the rhythm never slows and you never know what's coming next! A brilliant read!
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I use Alarm Clock Extreme around the clock, for morning wake up, for recuring daily reminders and for one-off alarm settings.  It's easy to see what the next alarm time is that is currently set.  It's easy to enable/disable alarms with a simple check box, leaving the alarm setting intact for future use.  It's easy to set alarms up for multiple days of the week.  And for those of us who hate getting up, it has a snooze feature.  Alarms can be set to get gradually louder until snoozed or cleared.  Easy to use, quick to set count down timer function for what ever you need to remember to do in x minutes (cooking, etc)  I love it and put it on my wife's new phone, also.
1475143389|5.0|I began working out 16 years ago at the age of 33.  Through the years, I have tried many different diets and exercise programs. I can honestly say the advice given in this book has been the most life transforming of all the programs I have tried.  Several aspects of the book stand out.  One, it is for everyone, no matter where you are in your journey to fitness.  The program is tailored made to YOU.  The goal is to have 3 sets of 6 maximum reps.  So if you are just starting, you just choose the weight that enables you to do no more than 6 reps.  Once you get those 6 reps, you increase weight, but the amount of weight by which you increase is up to you, so long as you cannot surpass the 6 reps.    This complete program includes a tailor made diet for maintaining, cutting, or bulking to fit your individual goal.  Specific directions are given to determine how many grams of proteins, carbs, and healthy fats YOU need, given your goal and your weight.    In addition, the reasonings behind different goals of cardio are given in easy to understand language.    This book is an easy read, no getting bogged down in technical terms, and is very affordable.    Lastly, if you even have a question whether it works or not, go to Mike Matthews'  Facebook page [...]. Look at his pictures.  He is his own best advertisement.
B00884GR0W|5.0|I am so freaking SICK of people giving games bad reviews because they're a &quot;ripoff&quot; of minecraft if Pitt's a &quot;ripoff&quot; WHY DID YOU BUY IT!!!!!!!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|...simple, easy, fun, it's facebook. what more can a person say ? there's nothing else quite like it. again, because of this app. I've been able to connect with my relatives from around the world in real-time. and I have thousands of relatives I never knew of until facebook brought the ease and fun of this functionality. Thank you Facebook. Also, meeting new people with similar interests is of most importance. No longer do I have to feel imprisoned in the Washingtonian mentality of the grunge-sacarcastic-pretentious-lily mindset here. I can connect with people that have fresh global &#34;winning&#34; perspectives on life. lol  I gave it only 4 stars cause there's always room for improvement. :)

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved his latest book.  It was a page turner all the way with all the twists and turn the plot took....great character development!
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|I loved the game!!! Enjoyed the storyline and the graphics were great!! Many hours of fun. Loved the puzzles! Hoping for a Part Two!!
B0038AUY96|4.0|A fabulous book, great plot and story and fast paced. But for one or two serious flaws in the plot...a very enjoyable read. Hailed by some as the \\"new\\" Stieg Larson...not. Nothing beats the \\"Girls with the Dragon Tattoo\\" trilogy...
B004SIP8SY|2.0|This is one of two Blu-rays I received which had very slight white grainy lines on the left side of the screen. It's not my Sony Blu-Ray player because all my other discs do not have this problem. Other then the lines the pic is sharp and clear, the lines are noticeable but not worth the expense to pay postage to return. Which leads me to wonder if these Blu-rays are knockoffs, maybe from China? Which is the biggest perpetrator of mass producing DVD's and dumping them on the U.S. internet market.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I think Nelson Demille is simply the best. I normally do not like international plots. More into local police procedural like Michael Connelly, Karin Slaughter, John Sanford,Robert Crais, T. Jefferson Parker. But Demille's John Corey character is just so much fun. Always a great story. One of those that you are kind of sad to see end. The great author always takes you on a journey and it is so enjoyable with alot of action and twist and turns. And of course the wit of John Corey. Great Read from the best author out there. There is a reason why Nelson Demille only comes out with a novel every couple/three years.
B000AY3KN0|2.0|This is one of the greatest movies in film making. One of the best ever made in my opinion. That's why i had to own it.  They sent it in a reasonable time, but the only problem was that it came with dents in the casing. The shipping box wasn't damaged at all....so they(Warehouse Deals, Inc) sent the package with damaging on it. Very disappointed that they would send out a copy like that.
1427207283|5.0|I bought this great book for my grandson, as a way to teach him English as second language. He is three years old and he learns by playing! He enjoys a lot this and some other books by Eric Carle that teach him basic English and at the same time delight him.I am very satisfied with the choice I made. The information I got through Amazon was detailed and very good, so I could do an \\"informed\\" choice.
B009YU62H2|1.0|Since these guys played at an Obama fundraiser, and since Obama will be taking more money from my paycheck in taxes, I won't be buying their music.<br /><br />Start respecting my property rights and I'll go back to respecting yours.
B0053O89YM|5.0|if you haven't seen the whole series from season 1, START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING! Not only does it make more sense down the road as you advance to season 2 and 3, but the character development and the incredible line of guest stars are just incredible. Each episode is its own adventure. Well worth the investment.
B0096I9UTE|5.0|It's no secret that I'm a huge Kylie Minogue fan, and this album demonstrates why. Kylie likes to rework her hits: she releases remix albums, and her concerts always feature her biggest songs done in inventive ways, keeping them fresh. This time, she takes a new approach to an album's worth of songs we're all very well familiar with, stripping away much of their \\"pop\\" traits and using instruments like strings to give them added emotional depth.<br /><br />The one rough spot on the album is (unsurprisingly) the Locomotion. Always a novelty to begin with, I confess I've never had any great love for this song, and it drags this album down for a few minutes between a pair of otherwise stunning songs, Slow and Can't Get You Out of My Head. Skip over the Locomotion, though, and this album is rock solid.<br /><br />Minogue is an underrated singer, and she is in fine voice here. The arrangements are fantastic, and the song selection (though predictable) is strong. Bottom line: This works. What could have been a throwaway experiment turns out to be a great addition to Kylie's incredibly long streak of great albums.
030758836X|5.0|I wanted to give up on this book at first. I didn't like how it went back and forth between present day and the diary, but how quickly everything went nuts! I couldn't put it down and thought all the crazy made it more entertaining.

B0007939NO|4.0|Even if, like me, you think that \\"Luv\\"--especially love at first sight--is a lot of bunk, you can still enjoy this tuneful Lerner & Loewe musical.  In the Scottish Highlands, two Americans, Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) and his cynical, hard-drinking best friend Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson), are hunting grouse when they get lost in a mist \\"on a murky brae.\\"  Though their map shows no habitations in the area, as dawn breaks they stumble across a village by the shore of a loch.  At first the villagers seem shy and standoffish, not to mention oddly dressed,  but shortly the men meet Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse), whose sister Jean (Virginia Bosler) is to marry Charlie Dalrymple (Jimmy Thompson) that very day, and Tommy is immediately smitten.  So is Fiona, who has always believed there's \\"one certain laddie for me\\" and is resolved to either wait till he appears or end her life \\"an old maid.\\"  During an idyllic expedition to the far hills to gather heather for the wedding decorations, she and Tommy fall in love, while Jeff, back at the village, is trying to fend off the attentions of a shepherdess.  But Fiona has a secret: her village--Brigadoon--is only visible for one day every hundred years; the rest of the time, people, livestock, buildings, and all float timelessly \\"somewhere between the mist and the stars.\\"  The terms of the \\"miracle\\" that permit this allow someone from outside to become part of the place if he loves someone who lives there and is willing to give up everything and everyone that belongs to him in the outside world--and Tommy wants to.  Or does he?  Meanwhile, the village is threatened by the bitter unhappiness of Harry Beaton (Hugh Laing), who has not only lost Jean to Charlie but longs to go to school in Edinburgh \\"and make somethin' of myself\\": if one Brigadooner ventures outside the boundaries of a tract perhaps five miles each way, eternal night will descend on the place.<br /><br />The high points of the movie (for those of us not into the romantic bit) are the 18th-century Scottish ambience, the dances, and of course Gene Kelly's breezy presence at the center of it all.  (Johnson is a bit unsympathetic, a change from most of the roles in which I've seen him.)  And at least one of the songs, \\"Almost Like Being in Love,\\" has become a popular standard.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The Avengers is, without a doubt, one of, if not THE absolute best action movie of the year.  It is non-stop, edge of your seat entertainment and I would whole heartedly recommend it to anyone who is up to  a totally enjoyable movie experience.

B007SGM084|3.0|First book fun, second book adequate.  But the third one was so confusing and so in need of good editing that I would never ask anyone to ad it.  In fact if there was an editor involved in this book. He or she should have been fired.  What could have been suspenseful became tedious and confusing.

0606259090|4.0|A different type of reading, if you enjoy books it is good to get out of your comfort zone sometimes, and read something else and make up your own mind.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|Like a good wine, Ridley scott just gets better.  Prometheus fills in a quest I've had since I first saw \\"Alien\\".  What about the Space Jockey? Prometheus takes us on a ride to answer that question.  It also lays the ground work for the follow up film.  I hope scott directs that film too.

B005HHSXP0|5.0|Great book, a great continuation to the saga., that has greatly improved with the change in the way each chapter is written. A must buy book for the fans of the previous saga.
B00942S4OY|4.0|One Direction follow-up 2012's smash debut [[ASIN:B006ZZAMWK Up All Night]] with a quick follow-up via fall 2012's [[ASIN:B00942S4OY Take Me Home]].  Take Me Home ends up being a more well-rounded effort than the band's debut, exhibiting growth from every member. That doesn't signify the band still doesn't possess a personality problem as far as transference to an album, but the voices are more distinct of one another this time. Essentially, Take Me Home adequately satisfies its niche - teen-pop/pop.<br /><br />\\"Live While We're Young\\" unsurprisingly kicks off Take Me Home keeping in mind the sensibilities of previous smash \\"What Makes You Beautiful.\\"  Liam opens the cut vocally while Zayn ends up getting the meatiest parts. The chorus is equally addictive and schmaltzy (\\"Let's go crazy, crazy, crazy 'til we see the sun...tonight let's get some, and live while we're young\\"), but accomplishes its feat.<br /><br />\\"Kiss You\\" outperforms \\"Live While We're Young,\\" characterized by quick tempo and quick-paced vocals. The chorus is nothing short of pop gold: \\"So tell me girl if every time we touch/you get this kind of rush/baby say yeah yeah yeah.\\" Add some obligatory corniness via \\"na na na na...\\" and \\"Kiss You\\" will easily get stuck in anyone's head.<br /><br />\\"Little Things,\\" penned by singer/songwriter Ed Sheeran (and Fiona Bevan), showcases One Direction's most mature song to date, sporting a slower pace. The thoughtful songwriting leads this mature charge, but the boys deliver, particularly the chorus:\\"I won't let these little things/slip out of my mouth/but if I do/it's you, it's you they add up to/I'm in love with you/and all these little things...\\" Another selling point is that each member has a distinct solo here. There is little quibble, though the cut does `sit' a bit with its acoustic guitar production stylings.<br /><br />\\"C'mon, C'mon\\" speeds things back up with an 80′s influenced chorus. It lacks the magic of \\"Kiss You\\" but remains a solid entity. \\"Last First Kiss\\" is better, opting for a mid-tempo groove.  Production work is solid, with drums and guitars sounding particularly excellent within the mix.  The chorus is predictably humongous, but that is a good thing (\\"I wanna be last, yeah/baby let me be oh let me be your last first kiss...\\") One of the album's finest.<br /><br />\\"Heart Attack\\" has a funky-pop groove and is gimmicky without overreaching. It is schmaltz-laden, given the notion that love can give you a heart attack, but this is teen-pop after all.<br />Dr. Luke is among the producers on the Queen-influenced \\"Rock Me.\\" The production borrows cues from \\"We Will Rock You,\\" attuning that sensibility to One Direction. The chorus is a selling point as always, especially the melodic pattern on lyrics \\"...I want you to hit the pedal heavy metal, show me you care...\\" Louis gets some much needed vocal love, delivering a catchy pre-chorus (\\" I used to think that I was better alone/why did I ever wanna let you go...\\"). Repetitiveness and perhaps over simplicity are the only rub.<br /><br />\\"Change My Mind\\" is one of the albums weaker cuts. It is by no means horrible, but lacks the oomph of the best. \\"I Would\\" easily atones, characterized by slick production work. The chorus is irresistible: \\"Would he say that he's in L-O-V-E? Well if it was me, I would (I would)/would he hold you when you're feeling low? Baby you should know that I would (I would)...\\" \\"I Would\\" is undeniably satisfying.<br /><br />\\"Over Again\\" is the second Ed Sheeran co-write, laden with ultra rhythmic lyrics. It is not bad, though some may prefer \\"Little Things.\\" \\"Back For You\\" is stronger, sporting catchy chorus and slick production. \\"Back For You\\" is amongst the top tier. Penultimate cut \\"They Don't Know About Us\\" is an urban-pop cut; truly the only one of its kind on Take Me Home. A solid change of pace, this cut is appropriately placed near the end. \\"Summer Love\\" closes. It gives Irish member Niall Horan his largest role as of yet, handlingthe chorus upon its first iteration (\\"cause you were mine for the summer/now we know it's nearly over/feels like snow in September...\\").  Overall, it solid, though not the `cream of the crop.'<br /><br />Overall, [[ASIN:B00942S4OY Take Me Home]] is a solid pop album. Yes it is corny and at times incredibly schmaltzy, but it appeals and plays to it's base exceptionally.  There are no overt misses - even \\"Change My Mind\\" works well enough - which makes this album more appealing than their platinum debut. What the band does need to keep working on is developing more personality. The voices are becoming more distinct, but this needs to continue in order to make One Direction transcend being a pop trend.the chorus upon its first iteration (\\"cause you were mine for the summer/now we know it's nearly over/feels like snow in September...\\").

B004QOB8SO|4.0|Season 2 of \\"Sherlock\\" takes 3 of the best and most famous cases of Holmes and updates them to the present day. So starting with really great stories by Doyle is a nice advantage.<br />\\"Scandal\\" is the story of Irene Adler, one of the most durable of Doyle's characters and certainly his most memorable female character. I think they miss the mark making Adler a dominatrix here. That being said, the story is well done.<br />\\"Hound\\" is also fairly well done although I'm not sure the modern twists add anything to the original story though.<br />\\"Fall\\" is the best of the bunch and is very fast paced and exciting. We'll have to wait until Season 3 to see how they resolve the climax though.<br />There's also a \\"Behind the Scenes\\" feature that is good although not as good as the First season's one. If you liked Season One and Holmes in general, you'll want this one too as it does some of the most important stories.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I would recommend this to all your super hero friends and family as long as they are older than 8. There are a few words that I'd rather not have my 6/7 year olds hear. Other than that it was AMAZING and love to watch it over and over.The special effects are incredible and a great storyline to get them together. LOVE THIS MOVIE!

159562015X|2.0|I enjoyed the personality test and reading about my results. My only two complaints are that this is book doesn't really have enough material to be considered a book and that I don't agree with the author's/publisher's business model.<br /><br />Not enough content: You get a code if you purchase a new book. You take a personality test online and get your 5 strengths. This is great, but the only problem is that means the book's contents are only a short intro chapter and 5 very short chapters on each of your 5 strengths. I would like to see more content.<br /><br />Author's business model: I really can't stand that you must buy a new book in order to read and use this book at all. I bought it used, because I didn't know about the access code... So I had to also buy a new one. Now I have one extra book... This book CAN'T BE USED unless you buy it new, and take the personality test. This bugs me because it is a ploy to force people to buy a new book every time. Just giving everyone a fair warning. This was the main factor influencing my rating.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book but very gory for ten year old children, but still a very very good book.

B008OE05IG|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of documentaries, but the best ones are usually deserving of their reviews.  I love sushi anyways, so seeing a documentary into the work ethic and discipline of the greatest sushi master in the world was entertaining.  The general theme is on never giving up and pursuing perfection in whatever craft you decide to devote your life to.  It's very interesting how something so ordinary as sushi can become a masterpiece when you have the right attitude.
B005K01VZS|4.0|This is the 2nd book by Mitch Albom I've read. I've seen a little bit of the movie so I had some idea what it was about.  I've really enjoyed reading his books and I have 2 more to go.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Book 2 was everything I expected.  Wow, they make my head spin, I laughed, I smiled and I got angry at both of them! But I couldn't stop once I started.  I'm excited to see  what happens next!
B00155GDXC|3.0|America is the richest and the most powerful country in the world. It also has tremendous control over world trade and media as a result of which millions of people around the world get a glimpse of life in America even if they have never crossed the border of their own cities/towns/villages. People - particularly from developing countries - want to be in America in order to make it big and lead comfortable lives.<br />It is therefore quite surprising that there is considerable resentment among people around the world towards America. It, in many cases, originates from radical ideas. Traditionally, the adopters of these radical ideas are found in religious schools (madrassas) in poor regions around the world.<br />But, in the last few years, this ideology has not left unscathed even the educated elite in the developed world( Amhad Omar Sheikh being a pretty good example).<br /><br />The book does not investigate topics like terrorism/wars/religion...etc. Infact, there are no terrorists in the book at all.<br />However, it does make an attempt to delve deeply into how events (like 9/11) tend to impact our thought process. This process changes normal people leading normal lives into fundamentalists. And sometimes, it also makes people deeply and unreasonably suspicious of people from other ethnicities.<br /><br />The leading protagonist(Changez) is a young man who has come to America with ambitions not unlike many other South Asians. He belongs to a family that is well-respected in Lahore. However, because of the political and economic situation in Pakistan, their wealth and position has been in constant decline over the years.<br />Changez, not lacking ambition, completes his studies with zeal and gets the job of his dreams.<br /><br />Belonging to a family that has lost its wealth, but not position in society, he is a proud man and does not want to be looked down upon by his peers.<br />Therefore, while in college, he constructs a false facade of being rich by hiding the fact that he has to work extra jobs in order to make ends meet.<br />He even uses an advance salary from him new job to pay for his vacation in Greece with other Princetonians.<br />When encountered by an elderly doorman during a visit to his girlfriend's (Erica) house who looked disapprovingly at his ethnic attire, he speaks to him haughtily to put him back at his place. Though, according to his own admissions, his country has had little achievements in modern times, he takes a great deal of pride in his ancestry and the historical accomplishments of his country. Perhaps, for this reason, it hurts him a lot when people mention the economic and social problems that plague Pakistan.<br /><br />While in new York, Changez is exceedingly successful professionally and also finds an undestanding mentor in Jim and a good friend in Wainwright. The cosmopolitan nature and the diversity of the city allow him to feel like a New Yorker within a few weeks of being there.<br />However, Sep-11 and the events after it change everything. He is often viewed with suspicion.<br />Changez, because of these events and the turmoil in his relationship with Erica, loses his ability to 'focus on the fundamentals' and begins to interpret events around him with ever-increasing influence of his hatred towards American policies. Infact, he views Sep-11 more as a destruction of American arrogance than American lives and therefore feels absolutely no grief at its occurrence. When travelling to Chile on a business trip, he is told the story of Janissaries by the head of the firm that he was valuating. The story was told in a business context and but was interpreted by Changez in a poilitical context.<br /><br />The stranger from America could be any American and considering the sizeable South Asian population in America, that place could very well have been in America. The behaviour of the stranger is representative of the uneasiness that Americans have begun to feel with people from other ethnicities (especially Muslims) and how unreasonably suspicious they can become.<br /><br />The book is an interesting read but somehow it failed to meet my expectations which were quite high ever since I learnt that it has been made into a movie by Mira Nair. But, I am not a great reader of books. Perhaps, I missed something here.
B008OJIBH8|4.0|This is review of the 30th anniversary Spaceship itself not the content of the movie.. everybody knows about the movie already..<br /><br />If I am not mistaken this spaceship combo pack was supposed to be only $55 but it is now selling for $250+/- wow!<br />I was lucky to get this for a lot less than the $250,  plus shipping (or was it free? I am not sure)<br /><br />More than what I anticipated.. the interior (you really can;t see inside where E.T. is)  has a warm/yellow colored LED bulb(?) or is it a small incandescent bulb? but the side \\"jets\\" have bright white LED bulbs.. when you press that button.. the top opens and the E.T. theme music plays although the quality is tin-y and cheap sounding speaker..but still good enough as a collector's item of course, and the lower door opens slowly with a little E.T. glued there .  My copy of the spaceship.. since the spaceship is plastic.. there is some hesitation for the lower door to fully open, sometimes it stops mid way and I have to push it down carefully, but when it works.. the effect is amazing..at least to my fanatic eyes.<br /><br />When I purchases this, I did not expect the light effects or the music playing. I was thinking of doing a hack of putting lights.. but since it already has the LED lights.. I am just happy to have this item in my possession!<br /><br />If you have the $250.. it will be worth it if you are a true/hard care fan.. I am not sure if this will go down in price

B006LSZECO|5.0|This was the first Gillian Flynn book I read, and I purchased her other two before finishing it. I'm always excited to find a new author, and I'm definitely excited to read more of her books.<br /><br />The best part about Gone Girl was my reaction to the characters. I literally went from disliking Amy in the beginning, to *really* sympathizing with her during the bulk of the novel - and then when the plot twist came, I was so invested in her that I still ended up rooting for her in the end. Similarly, while it was difficult to fully dislike Nick, he still gave me the skeevy vibe right up to the end. I love being torn about the characters I'm reading; I love it when I can find something in them to like, even when they're doing despicable things. Flynn is an incredibly talented writer. I can't wait to see what sort of dark, twisty hero(ine) she comes up with next.

B00A8DGHCY|5.0|When season 3 was ending, I was still unsure if there was going to be a season 4, and EVEN IF THERE WAS A SEASON 4, how the chemistry in the choir room would be absolutely different. It tore me apart to see them going their separate ways, the episode where Mr. Schue wants to do his wedding in May because he was too afraid to admit that he'll miss them out loud because it was coming to an end, really hit home. I thought to myself that even if there is a season 4, it'd be totally different, and I was saddened by it. HOWEVER, I love GLEE, and I believe LIFE IS A MUSICAL. There is always a song to describe how you're feeling at that exact moment, so I knew no matter what I'd be watching. As for SEASON 4, I am NOT DISAPPOINTED at all. I actually like the new characters, Marley, Ryder, Dean, & Jake. I was also excited to see Sarah Jessica Parker and Kate Hudson. I do not like the character KITTY at all. I thought in \\"GLEASE\\" she should have been exposed for making Marley's outfits smaller, and persuading her to be bulimic . I don't think as her character grows in this season, that I could ever be fond of her. She is seriously mean. Even when Santana was mean, she still had a heart. Marley is absolutely adorable, kind of reminds me Ariel, I think her and Ryder would make such a cute couple. Kudos to her mom too. I believe they are the best addition in GLEE so far.<br /><br />The Finn/Rachel/Dean thing, that ONE hurt to see at first but I honestly think TIME will bring FINCHEL back together. Glee without FINCHEL just makes no sense. As for Klaine, I cannot see these two being with ANYONE ELSE other then each other.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Love Ms. Boyle's work and have listened to this CD, three times since receiving it. Somethings missing...her voice lacks timbre and many of the songs appear a bit flat and not quite to her lofty standards. I'm ambivalent about Donny Osmond as a soloist, but he lacks the range of Ms. Boyle, while Michael Crawford is a much better fit !!Very well done for fans and recommended for first-time listeners, but I sense she has better work ahead !!
0810989956|5.0|I got this for my 8 year-old grandson, who has read all the books by himself, and he absolutely loves this, and began immediately filling in some of the pages as soon as it arrived.  He continues to drag it out from time to time to add more.  It is definitely designed with the kid in mind.  The only complaint would be that there are a lot of blank pages at the end, ostensibly for the purpose of the kid making notes or something, but to my mind they are just fillers.  But aside from that, I don't regret in the least purchasing this book for him.  It's worth it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|could be a better game. too many items to collect - energy takes too long to refill - diamonds have to be bought with real money (not everyone has money to spend on these games - free should mean free) - too many updates... these are the same reasons why I stopped playing other games - just too much crap for it to be fun....

0062082353|5.0|Not a slow point in the whole book, not disappointed at all. Worth every penny, very glad it was recommended to me.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I have owned this album since day one and have played it to death. Some of the songs are just classic but, as with some other reviewers, some are just not impressing me. Two songs, Slinky Thing and The New Breed are great songs about an older guy hanging out with, and reflecting on attractions and interactions with younger women. A little like Cousin Dupree in that almost \\"dirty old man\\" groove. Truth is, many older guys still think they are 27 years old when it comes to women and Fagan is the one to latch on to that and sing about it.<br /><br />The three songs I have been skipping over are Memorabilia, Weather In My Head and Out Of The Ghetto. In trying to work out why, I realize it is because of the words and not the music. The music on the whole album is amazing - the instrumentation is great and I am loving the melodica being so upfront and bluesy. To me it is reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's harmonica playing. So it is the lack of poetry that disappoints me on those tracks. \\"You can fix the weather in the world, just like Mr Gore says, but what can be done with the weather in my head?\\" just has none of the hipster vibe I am used to - none of that obscure, abstract imagery that I associate with classic SD and Donald Fagan songs. The Isaac Hayes cover contains a great instrumental take on the song but lines like \\"I took you out of the ghetto but I could not take the ghetto out of you\\" are just instantly dated and corny through overuse. It's like \\"You can take the man out of the country but you can't take the country out of the man\\". We've heard it so many times. It once sounded like it meant something deep but then we realized there was no real insight there and then it became annoying. I cringe.<br /><br />And finally, Memorabilia asks the question \\"Have you seen the memorabilia?\\". It does not matter how many times I hear the question, my answer is always \\"Nope. I haven't seen the memorabilia and now I know I never will.\\" And then it becomes annoying, so can youplease stop asking? You're nagging me now. I am not sure why it niggles at me - there are other famous questioning songs that don't have that effect: Have you Ever Seen The Rain?, Who Knows Where the Time Goes?, Blowing in the Wind (How many roads must a man walk down?).<br /><br />But this is Donald Fagan so I know I must be wrong to feel like this and now I don't skip Memorabilia any more- I ignore the titular question and concentrate on the groove - on everything else that is wonderful in the tune. Weather In My Head I am beginning to listen to again because the backing is so damn good but, so far, I am still not ready for Out of the Ghetto even though I get the irony - that he is singing about a different ghetto than Isaac Hayes. It is a throwback cover version that doesn't seem worth the space on the album.<br /><br />Slinky Thing, I'm Not The Same Without You, The New Breed, Miss Marlene, Good Stuff (my favorite), and Planet D'Rhonda stand alongside anything else ever done by Donald Fagan or Steely Dan as pure jazz-rock diamond classics.

B009JCL58G|5.0|When I first heard the music in the film \\"Cloud Atlas\\", I knew I had to have it on my MP 3 Player. The simple tune went through many variations, which was fun to hear. When I downloaded it to the Amazon Cloud Player, I was able to take it to any one of my computers and my phone. The music has both emotion and character, evoking vivid memories of the film (which I will get on Blue Ray when it comes out.) I highly recommend this to both film music buffs and classical fans.

Simply a page turner!!  I read it cover to cover in less than 2 days.<br /><br />A must read for anyone who is interested in where Wall Street and Investment banking in general has gone wrong and why we are in the mess we are in financially through out the world.<br /><br />If more people would take the responsibility and call to arms to expose, correct and confront immoralities in business and all aspects of life, what kind of world would we live in.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyed this book.

B0085RQLXK|2.0|I am a fan of Aerosmith and recently saw them in concert and they are still great.<br />Steven Tyler still has the voice, and the rest of the band are as good as ever.<br />About the CD, the tracks were very flat sounding, muffled sound lacking clarity. The entire CD sounds blended with a monotone harmonic throughout each track. It lacks sound variation.<br />Lyrics are relatively repetitious on a few of the tracks.<br /> You can hear that they still have talent, but the mixing sounds bad to me.<br />I wasn't sure what to expect from a duet with Carrie Underwood but,\\"Can't Stop lovin' you\\" is good<br />The case that the CD is in is extremely cheap. No spindle to hold the CD which slides around freely during shipping or travel. The left edge of case is open so after removing the wrapper you can touch the CD. This allows dust and dirt to potentially damage disc.<br /> In general I was disappointed with this album.
B00079FUI6|4.0|My taste in television shows is quite varied, but some of my favorites are Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, Mad Men, Downton Abbey, and for comedies I enjoy Psych, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock.  I'm not usually into shows that look like this (silly chick flick television dramas), unless something about them really draws my attention.  In this case, it was critics high praise of the first season.  Unusually high praise, and very high ratings.<br /><br />So, I watched it, expecting the very worst - and was actually very pleasantly surprised.  It reminds me a lot of a parody of a soap opera with many caricature characters (the rich housewife sleeping with the hot young gardner, the crazy uptight conservative plastic perfect trophy wife), yet were able to add dimensions to them that actually made them more than caricatures; but actually likable, interesting people that could draw viewer empathy.<br /><br />It also has a definite dark, mean streak in it, so the first season definitely fits into the well-done black comedy category.  It's a little morbid and I think it really is satire to a degree.<br /><br />The stories of all the main characters are pretty interesting this season.  We have Gabrielle, the rich housewife, having an affair with her 16 year old gardner.  Bree is having family problems because she no longer communicates well with her husband, who is sick of her almost robotic movements of a plastic housewife with no feelings.  Lynette is dealing with four children as a stay-at-home mom, yet longing to go back to work.  And Susan is desperately trying to earn the affections of the new guy on the block, Mike.<br /><br />There is also the main mystery story line of the season, which is not bad, but I don't think is nearly as strong as the personal lives of the main characters.  The narrator is Mary Alice, who committed suicide for an unknown reason, and it appears that her husband and son may have something to do with it.  Characters uncover more and more of the truth as time goes on, finally revealing what really happened at the end of the season.  What made this story line a little weak to me was the fact that Paul and Zach seemed fairly one dimensional and boring, and most importantly - no one really seemed to give a damn about Mary Alice's suicide.  If she was truly one of the best friends of these four women, how come everything was back to normal and laughs a week later?<br /><br />The only person who truly seems affected by her death is Susan at times, but even then - not so much.  Such a traumatic shock would surely completely tear these people apart, so I think maybe at least a six month instead of one week jump in time from her suicide would have been more appropriate.  I know it's part of the morbidity and all; people selfishly continuing to lead their pointless lives when their best friend just committed suicide.  But even then, it's a stretch.<br /><br />The supporting characters are also fun, such as the creepy Mrs. Huber.  The story lines also interweave very nicely together, and while a lot of it is obviously very silly, it's nicely done in a satirical fashion and the characters still have depth to them, which makes it more than just some silly, stupid show.<br /><br />One of my main issues with this show as a series is the fact that the women never really seemed to have much of a girl friend connection together, like the girls on Sex and the City did.  They act like BFF, but keep so many secrets from one another and their interactions are sort of of weird and sporadic, that it doesn't really feel right.<br /><br />It also has a Twin Peaks feel to it.  The mystery, the drama, the who killed who; if you loved Twin Peaks you may actually like this, male or female.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there is a MAJOR issue with being a parody of something.  There is a fine line between making fun of something and falling into exactly what you're making fun of when you run out ofideas.  That is exactly what happened to Desperate Housewives.  Well, there were two things.  1) lack of creativity/ideas and forcing super contrived story lines, something that wasn't very common in the first season and 2) Cherry had much less to do with the writing and season two, and when you give up your baby to the other writers to control, things like that happen.  Although he came back in the third season, a lot of the damage was permanently done, and it never truly recovered.<br /><br />Great, interesting first season with unbelievable potential, and then....completely failed after that.  Well, at least this season is still worth watching and rewatching here and there.<br /><br />If you like dark comedy/dramas that are Twin Peaks-esque, check this out.

B0090YHSFC|4.0|I really do like the game. Its got an easy concept and the penguins are really cute! But I just cant get off this one level on world 2. Other then that its pretty fun! :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show!  It is so incredibly good.  Once you buy it from Amazon, there are no problems.  It is clear and plays right through without any error. Thanks Amazon for offering this great show!
B00683JK9K|2.0|Not friendly when hiding pieces that have been used and then can't find them when needed.<br />Eg;  if I drag a puzzle piece and drop it hides behind the puzzle and later when I need that piece I have to click on the puzzle and move it around to see it hiding UNDER other pieces of the puzzle that I have been completed.  Very fustrating.  Will not buy again.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very good and addictive game. The only downfall would be that you can't see the whole room when you're searching for objects, which makes it sort of annoying.
B004L3AQFG|4.0|I could have given it a higher rating if there weren't so much bad language and nudity in it.  I don't know why such a good story needs all that ugly stuff to sell it.
B000JR4QQ8|5.0|Fit perfectly with the original trilogy and provided info which answered all of my questions after reading the original books.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Best album of the year. Best rap album of the decade. Highly recommend you purchase this album, no thought need to be put into it
B0085RQLXK|1.0|Wont waste time bashing these guys. In short, another huge Aero disappointment! Dont waste your time. If you dont have Rocks,Night in the ruts, Toys,or any album from the 70's, get that one instead.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I remember when this first came out, people either told me they loved it or that it sucked. A lot of people also told me that this was Green Day's \\"sell-out\\" CD. I took a chance on it years later at a used record shop and whaddya know, it's actually quite a good album. It's actually an excellent concept album that works well as a whole and song by song basis.<br />Green Day push their musical limits to new levels here in terms of song composition, musicianship, and different styles. They still maintain their fuzzed out guitar here for a good majority of the songs but the band really does work outside the normal formula that they've been so well known for. They succeed with their experimentation and my expectations were actually surpassed here because this album was a huge risk for the band.<br />The people who call this the \\"sell-out\\" album where Green Day abandoned their fanbase are way off mark in my opinion. This was actually a huge risk for them and could've tanked in a music climate that was pretty generic but it works in a huge way because it's ultimately a very intense and passionate album. Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill guests on it and she's as far from a corporate sell-out as you can get.<br /><br />If you like Green Day, chances are if you give this album a chance and disregard all this stupid negativity due to popularity, you'll actually really enjoy it.<br /><br />If you listen to it expecting a certain sound and not appreciating good music just because it isn't what you expect from the band, you may be disappointed with some of the songs on here.<br /><br />Bottom line though, good is good and this album is an example of how to take a risk and make it pay off.
B002BWP49M|5.0|I have watched all of the Twilight Sagas and read all the books. They are a great movie to watch with your family as they are so loving and real in the fact that they all care and watch out for each other. They are loyal to the people they love and in this world we live in its hard to find. So if nothing else is learned from this hopefully teens and anyone who bullies people see life in a different way.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I very much enjoyed the trilogy of the &#34;  I felt the writing, plot and character developement was quite well done and couldn't put any of the books down.  Book 3, &#34;Mockinjay&#34; brought all three books to a complete and agreeable close.  I highly recommend this book series.
B001AR0D4A|5.0|love steven king. blu-ray makes The Mist much more exciting and real. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror films.l
B003FM1MNO|5.0|It is a great movie with great acting, effects, characters, and storyline. I would recommend this to any one who likes to watch fantasy movies.
B005XLN97M|4.0|Very easy to assemble. The only problem is the kitchen prop doesn't stay attached very well. But it is a very good purchase for the money!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this. I really like the challenge to unlock games by earning pointsand the variety keeps you hooked.my kids also enjoy helping me get through and unlocking new games. its fun to see what's next and the game is long lived and still fun when completed.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my teacher has this game and she said she loves it. she said her husband is trying to get it out of her hands.
1419705849|4.0|It can't be easy keeping the Wimpy Kid series fresh, but somehow Jeff Kinney manages to create yet another book of funny slices in the life of Gregory Heffley. He goes back, in fact, so far back we are introduced to the life of Greg in utero; as remembered and described, of course, by Greg himself! Then, a young childhood of constant hand-me-downs as Rodrick's younger brother and, eventually, the \\"forgotten\\" older brother to baby Manny.<br /><br />Considering who is the target audience of this book, there's plenty of silliness and challenges that Greg must overcome. School life is the primary focus with important issues such as contraband toilet paper, being the power behind Rowley's rise on the school's social committee, and finding a date to the Valentine's dance. A dance which was originally to be fundraiser that was going to feature pro-wrestling and motorcycle stunt riders (Drat those darn adults!). Luckily for Greg, he has his four-time married uncle to give him advice how to best attract a potential date.<br /><br />There's the usual characters featured in The Third Wheel; Mom, Dad, Manny, Rowley, and Rodrick to a smaller degree.There were several situations that made me laugh out loud, but younger fans of the series may not get some of the more middle-school audience humor. Overall, I think fans of Kinney's will not be disappointed.
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|Figured it would be easy trying to figure these out. wrong. don't like having to pay or connect to Internet if I need help. Would still recommend this game for older kids or adults like me.
B00000373U|5.0|A classic! Elliot had the knack of hitting those notes and lyrics that play on and on in your head. I'm haunted(in a good way) by the high pitched whistle you hear throughout \\"Angeles\\" which is one of if not my very favorite song of his, and the simple beauty that comes through in \\"Between the Bars\\" keeps you wanting more. Unfortunately, we can only listen to what he left behind, but it's of the caliber that will never die.
B000000XBC|4.0|It had most of the songs I wanted & I enjoy hearing them again. A good companion to Vol. !
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I really love the fact that it connects to the fast charger and can also be used to transfer files from my computer.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|Great price for a Christmas gift. Person cannot wait to recieve was ask for becasue the per episode was twice the price
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I wouldn't watch a movie about Abraham Lincoln generally but add vampires and it sounds great. The movie had a decent plot, a great lead, and an over the top end.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn does not dissapoint!  It's another great action-packed story.  Will Gould appear in his next book?<br />Bev Mc
B008D19WBQ|4.0|First glance:<br /><br />Just got this today and have really enjoyed it. I also was skeptical when I heard that this series wouldn't have the extended episodes that are on the dvds.  To tell the truth I wasn't sure if I'd get this set. However I did get it and honestly not having the extended episodes isn't that bad. Yes I'll agree that Warner Brothers should have gone the extra mile and put in the extended scenes having set a prior precedent in the dvd sets. But to me I'd rather have this than nothing.<br /><br />The Content:<br /><br />The video is still not as good as I've seen on other Blu ray transfers but man when you go back and watch the series on dvd its amazing that we used to think dvd quality was so good. Having now seen some of my favorite episodes on these discs it'll be hard to go back and watch them on dvd with lower definition. It's really enjoyable to see them in such great quality, and really is like seeing them new.<br /><br />The gag reels and extra scenes and bonus content are nice. I've never really been into checking out all the extra features but they are nice to have when you want to watch them.<br /><br />One comment I will make to WB is please hire a graphic designer to make your menus. All your blu ray menus look like they were designed for kids with huge bubbly web 2.0 icons. I'm totally ok with the menu just having the words play, episodes, etc. I don't need big graphics taking up my screen, I know what \\"play\\" means.<br /><br />Box:<br /><br />The packaging is way over the top with a lenticular box and interior binder to hold all the discs. Honestly the box is nice but I would of been ok with paying 15-20 bucks less and have less spectacular case. The lenticular cover is kinda cheesy and the booklet is just a table of contents for the discs.<br /><br />The one thing that bothers me about the case design is that the discs are labeled by episodes and not by season (for example discs are labeled numerical 1-21 with the episodes listed as110-121). I would have preferred the discs to be labeled by season and then numerically (Season 4 disc 2, etc). Just a minor complaint but would have made navigating the discs to find certain seasons a whole lot easier.<br /><br />Conclusion:<br />Is this set worth it? It depends. If you like friends as much as I do and don't care about the extended episodes missing then yes. If you are someone who's going to be bothered that there is a couple lines here and there that weren't originally aired then you probably shouldn't get this. I wouldn't hold out on this one just due to the extended scenes though. Blu ray has been out since 2006 and Friends just came out this month so the odds for WB releasing another set just aren't very good.<br /><br />All in all I really like having this set and being able to see the episodes in high def. I think the price is very reasonable on this set($150 for 21 blu ray discs? I remember when they were $30 a piece!) I'll always have my Friends on dvd for when I want to see an extended episode but for me this will be my go to set to see my favorite show.<br /><br />Could this review beeeee any longer?
1451695195|3.0|Well written, very entertaining; it's impossible not to like Dr. Alexander and his lovely immediate and extended family, whom he takes a lot of words to tell us about. Alexander describes a realm he calls Heaven (\\"the gates of Heaven were closed\\") in which he received a beautiful three-fold promise: \\"You are loved... you have nothing to fear... there is nothing you can do wrong\\". Through his NDE he found, among other things, that:<br />- \\"Love is, without a doubt, the basis of everything... This (unconditional love) is the reality of realities, the truth of truths\\"<br />- there are \\"countless universes (in which) evil was necessary because without it free will was impossible\\"<br />- We ('we ALL'?) will one day \\"(ascend) in the timeless alternate dimension\\"<br />- \\"The very fabric of the alternate dimension is love and acceptance\\"<br />- we are not only spiritual beings, we are actually \\"eternal beings\\"<br />So, it seems all that needs to happen for all of our \\"eternal beings\\" to access Alexander's heaven and be unconditionally loved and accepted is, simply, to die. He expresses no concept of sin, no concept of justice (the first word is not found at all in the entire book, the second only in the context of words not being able to \\"do justice\\" to describe something) and, of course, no hell. There is no savior; Jesus barely deserves two mentions, one as a quote by someone else, the second one in a \\"painting of Jesus breaking bread with his disciples\\". As I said, very entertaining.
1452101248|4.0|I received this book as a gift and wasn't sure whether this would be a regular in my repertoire.  Initially I wasn't sure I'd get much use of the book considering some of the ingredients that I may not be able to easily source and I'm not a super vegetarian looking for full veg meals.  However, I dove in tried a few things and have found a few new favorite dishes! I can't wait to keep trying more.  So far my favs are the green couscous and Avocado quinoa salad.<br /><br />I know I've only tried a few, but being I was so pleased I thought I might write a nice review encouraging others to check it out.  And look at that, over 100 already written!<br /><br />So don't be shy to give this book a shot even if you're just an average non-vegetarian cook looking for something new.  You'll find some great dishes that are very achievable and you will enjoy.  I'd recommend to any of my friends.<br /><br />Num num!!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|For recreational reading, this book is great! Since I couldn't bear to put it down,<br />I read it in one night.<br />Thanks to the author for another action-filled novel.<br /><br />Lois
0307719774|4.0|I bought this journal as a gift for my bestfriend. She loved it.<br /> It's a small journal with small spaces to write for each year. It's perfect for those who have smallish handwriting and of course, neat. My bestfriend is exactly this type.<br />I don't buy it for myself because i have bigger and less tidy handwriting. Also, I'm the type who write a lot - I always need a lot of space to rant/express my thoughts. If you are like me, you would probably want a bigger version (which i don't know if they have one).
B008C1O8CA|5.0|Green Day is my favorite band and I have listened to all of there CDs. This is one that goes along with the great Green Day CDs.
0470913029|1.0|The book does not show scientific evidence of its claims. It makes assumptions that our ancestors were hunters where scientific proof has shown that their life was more sustained by eating grains, nuts, seeds and vegetables. Totally disappointed. Not worth reading.
B007NU54H4|4.0|Great story line for young children.  I bought this for my grabddaughter who is 4 yrs. old, she loved it.
B00009NHC5|5.0|We just recieved this movie from Amazon.com yesterday..We just got done watching this dvd about 5 minutes ago..I need to mention just like the Audrey Hepburn character of &quot;Suzy&quot; my wife Amanda is recently blind (Amanda went blind in 2005)..When we found an role that Audrey plays a blind lady we were intrigued to say the least..this movie as all movies of this type from this day of 1960s starts off slow..but have patience it will pay off in a big way just like a classic Hitchcock film..this is very Hitchcock like..all give very brillisnt performances..Arkin/Crenna/Weston is pure evil in the villian of movie history..Hepburn was nominated for an Oscar and was totally robbed to not to have won it..she is so much like my wife she must've worked with a blind girl to study the role..to give proof of what kind of ride this film is..In last 20 minutes my blind wife Amanda *(who of course can only hear the movie) was hanging on me as for dear life..Biting my fingers and telling off the tv screen..Now if that dont prove how scary this film got then i don't know what does..So check this out you won't be disappointed..And lastly in closing,,Audrey Hepburn's &quot;Suzy&quot; like my wife my beloved Amanda is the world champion blind girl and very much an inspiration..snuggle up to one you love you may not have a finger..LoL..Enjoy and don't miss this one..

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|FInding this very addictive. I wish there were better directions but I guess I'll figure them out. A lot more fun than the computer version.
B000FC1KBG|2.0|This is a review of the Kindle version of \\"Secrets of the Baby Whisperer\\".  They did a sloppy job of translating this into digital form.  I read the book on my iPad and many of the tables/charts were mis-aligned or partitioned over serveral pages so they are impossible to read.  Seems like they didn't proof-read the digital version before putting it up for sale.<br /><br />The Kindle version also does not allow you to Loan the book to friends.  I didn't notice this before purchasing and it's just another reason why the Kindle version is lacking. Get a hard copy of the book if you plan on using this as a reference book.<br /><br />The book itself was good.  I'd give it 4 stars.  I didn't agree with everything she said, but I learned a few tips about understanding my baby and his signals.  Much of her advice is intuitive so it gives you confidence and tips which you can use to follow your own instincts. She has some helpful appendix tables with information on baby development and feeding.
B008O69SZ0|5.0|Ian is one the best song writers I have heard.  His new music keeps getting better and better.  I love &#34;When I'm President&#34;  His CD's are exceptional and his live performances are over the top!  Highly recommend this and all of his CD's!  Great value at Amazon too!!
B0007TKNII|5.0|The Phantom disc was an excellent recording and the exact edition we were looking for. We would fully recommend this disc to anyone who enjoys the Phantom !
B004JMSIRC|5.0|Great quality, great movie! No complaints from the movie quality physically or quality. Best of the series and Jeff Bridges bald head is even shinier in HD!
B009KHDT0C|1.0|Why does Tim Burton insist on ruining his career with crap like this? (or that less than wonderful Alice in Wonderland?). He used to be amazeballs! Dark Shadows was just dreadful and worse, boring.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|All of the hype from the initi release doesn't die in the transition to home theatres everywhere! There's not a better home entertainment experience I have ever had!
B000JJSPXQ|4.0|Looking for a hits CD that gives me all the chart stuff, I found that this is missing the above (U.S.) hit.  Fans from other countries may not miss that one, and this does have all their other hits.  By the way, the CD with all the U.S. hits that I eventually found is the out-of-print \\"Don't Bore Us, Get To the Chorus.\\"<br /><br />Of course, these huge hooks bore their way, in a good way, into your brain and stay there.  \\"The Look\\", \\"Joyride\\", \\"Listen to Your Heart\\", and several others were as splashy as pure pop got between '89 and about '93.  I guess they got to the chorus pretty fast...
B008RV5K5E|5.0|As a giant Batman geek, this gritty story not before told in the animated universe deserves the acclaim and then some! GREAT voice talent, brilliant storyline, and moving themes. The only problem is I have to wait for the conclusion!
B007REV4T8|5.0|You are going to travel. London, Istanbul, Shanghai, Macao, and Scotland of course, the castle of Skyfall. And hurry up about it because Skyfall will be completely destroyed in the operation.<br /><br />You have the stunts, the car hunts, the chases, and all the physical elements necessary in that film. Istanbul is one city splashed with this mission and that's the second time in three months, after Taken 2. But it is hardly really said. You recognize Turkey if you know it.  Shanghai is more in the tradition of Bourne and his films. But no Eastern Europeans, not even Moscow nor Berlin. That is rather clean after all. The main damage is in London and Scotland. They even cut the Eiffel Tower out, but not Big Ben.<br /><br />The British respect their borders and like their country. We are speaking of the MI6 of course but there is a big leak in the system and that leak does not come from outside but from inside, in fact from an agent who was one of the best, if not the best in his 1980-90 time, but he got caught and in the MI6, the famous M, the lady boss of the service, decided to trade him. When someone very faithful survives such a treacherous decision, you can expect difficulties.<br /><br />And difficulties they got. But the main difficulty came from the government and Parliament who started criticizing the work of the service and the security of the country in the name of modern technology that should be used instead of secret agents and shadowy maneuvers. And no one has the courage to bring to light the simple facts. Yet this simple situation of a treacherous agent within the system is the main idea in this film: danger is not from outside but from inside and the solution can only come from inside too.<br /><br />That's why this film is better than most other films in that field. It is not targeting foreign enemies but a national agent that turned bitter, sour, rotten, self-motivated by vengeance.<br /><br />The point is not even to know whether he is going to get his vengeance or not, but how it is going to happen. And that you will have to look for it in the film. I hope you enjoy the marvellous Scottish castle that is destroyed like a house of cards built by kids.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUet his vengeance or not, but how it is going to happen. And that you will have to look for it in the film. I hope you enjoy the marvellous Scottish castle that is destroyed like a house of cards built by kids.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|Wow, what a horrible movie. It was like a 10 year old directed it: lots of cliches and weak acting. Benecio Del Toro was the only redeeming factor. Oliver Stone has truly lost his sh*t
B0088EDMMS|5.0|This movie is a must see in our household during the week before Halloween. It's not too scary for kids/grandkids and still appeals to adults who are kids at heart. When my kids were young tbey would watch this movie over and over again. I love Bette Middler and the young boy who portrayed Thackery Binx grew up to star in a very popular TV show, NCIS.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|I have read one or two biographies on \\"Arnold\\" but it's nice to read something from him about himself.  If you grew up watching Arnold on the big screen and enjoying working out then this is a must read for you.
B008RTE08E|4.0|The Beatles were stretching their wings (no pun intended) with this.  It was the start of their having control on what they did.  It's a little bit of each of their ideas and not much plot, just fun and music.  It was still enjoyable and if you are a Beatles fan you'll truly like it.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It charges ur kindle fire way faster. Amazon did a great job on the charger. It has a nice look to it.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Scary in the sense that I'm sure this is how our governments are handling this sort of thing and how vulnerable we all are.  Wonderfully done though.
0800141660|5.0|I watch this movie all the time. When I'm sick or just need something on in the background. The picture quality is excellent, and who doesn't love Alan Rickman.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a terrific read - The characters were well-done and believable, the plot was one that had you wondering what was REALLY going on - I enjoy this author and this was one of my favorites that he's written.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Love Actually has become a holiday staple in our house. We'll watch it on TV or pop the DVD in.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved this book...from the beginning it captures you.<br />After I finished reading it, I didn't want to read another book so I could enjoy the memories from this rich read.
B00846REIS|5.0|When I first began reading this book, I thought it was a rip off of Fifty Shades of Grey; however, as I read, I forgot about Fifty Shades.  Although there are similarities between the two books, Bared to You is written better, and I thought it was a little more explicit.  If you like romance, Bared to You is a great choice.  I became so enthralled in this book that I finished it in two days, then immediately downloaded the second book.  I read that book in a day & was saddened to find the third book is set for release in May 2013, so I pre-ordered it.  Definitely worth the read!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote Webclipper to clip many items when surfing the web at home (or work) so I can then have access later.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The first half or so of this book is terrific. Building a story around unusual photos is a unique idea; I loved it. It starts out with such a BANG that I kept thinking what a terrific book this is.<br /><br />An impending mystery + some historical references + an exotic location + interesting characters = what could be better? How about a bit less Harry Potteresque time travel, magical powers and teen angst? I love \\"Harry Potter\\" but what one loves about Harry doesn't necessarily translate perfectly into other books.<br /><br />I would have been much happier with  this book had it not ended so abruptly. It's a set up for a sequel, which in itself is okay, but it seems as though the ending is forced.<br /><br />The photos in this book are a bit difficult to view on Kindle; similarly the letters are difficult to read.

B008HK3XOU|4.0|Very nice good quality case, seems sturdy enough to protect my Kindle Fire HD. Only drawback is no opening in the case to charge it while closed. Solved the problem by carefully cutting a slot on the spine perfectly lined up with the ports. Being a crafter I was able to stitch and finish it to look professional. Makes it much more convenient when charging. You would think that would be a basic design requirement but for some reason it was left out. I actually knew this before I purchased it, but felt the alteration was possible, still felt it was worth mentioning.

There really are places in the world for this background.

1452111014|5.0|After watching Wreck-it Ralph in theaters, I felt the need to go buy Wreck-it Ralph merch. I love the movie and I love the game world that was shown. I know Disney usually releases these \\"The Art of...\\" for their new movies, so I searched for a Wreck-it Ralph one and fortunately they did create one for the movie. :) I just received the book from the mail, and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with the thickness of the book and the size. I was expecting a thin book and I knew it's hardcover, but I was surprised that it was quite heavy (just means that the book has more than I expected! :D). The book is filled with the beautiful artwork that you get to see in the movie and artwork that you didn't get to see in the movie. Along with the artwork, there are descriptions of the inspiration/background to each. Also at the end, they have \\"Bonus\\" artwork that was unfortunately cut out of the movie, but still enjoyable none the less. If you loved the game worlds that were featured in Wreck-it Ralph, you should definitely buy this. This would make a great gift too! :)

B004SUDQ8Q|4.0|This superlative story takes place in 1931 in Western Australia, during a period of time when half-caste Aboriginal children are forcibly taken from their Aboriginal mothers and then raised in a government issued camp for their \\"own benefit\\". This was done out of concern that a third race would become prevalent and to prevent this, they thought that they could change these half-caste children back to a white Western culture over the transformation of three generations. They forced the western culture along with language, religion, and stopped the attempt to mate with additional aboriginals in order to eventually make this culture non-existent. I was completely oblivious to this policy prior to this movie and was dumbfounded to even find that it was even true and was so up until 1970.<br /><br />In this movie, two sisters, Molly and Daisy along with their cousin Gracie find themselves embarking upon a journey to return home over a thousand miles away by following the \\"rabbit proof fence\\", that is used to contain the rabbits in order to protect the farm land. These three young children were half caste Aborigines and were kidnapped from their Aboriginal mothers and sent to Moore River Native Settlement where they are contained because it is what is thought to be best by the white Western Australian culture surrounding them. These children receive education that is motivated to train them as domestic servants and they are taught to turn them from their Aboriginal culture and become \\"white mannered\\". Even with authorities, headed by Kenneth Branagh, watching the Aboriginal children every minute, the girls Molly, Gracie, and Daisy defy all odds and are able to escape Moore's River. While being tracked, they maintain being one step ahead and find help from a few others along their journey but it's the determination of the girl's that keeps them going. I won't ruin the ending but this movie is a must-see. The authoritative figures, especially Kenneth Branagh, could easily be deemed immoral and evil but realistically their intentions were not to harm but to \\"help\\" these children because they thought what they were doing was good and helpful. This movie was extremely emotional and brought smiles, laughter, and lots of tears. The characters brought this movie to life. I don't think this movie is about racism but about cultures and religions thinking that they are helping others by implementing their ideas when in fact it does more harm than good and who are we to dictate what others believe.

1432794426|5.0|There have been many books written lately on Michael Jackson and his eccentric life. One book that is strikingly different to some degree is the one written by Karen Moriarty, author of \\"Defending a King\\".<br /><br />Moriarty writes to some degree about the life of Jackson, his legend, his musical genius that made him the super star he was. She touches briefly, upon the side of him, that isn't seen or discussed. You will empathize with his psyche, yet learn how he gave his heart to anyone without question, trusting everyone, believing the good in people and at the same time being burned by the very same conviction.<br /><br />His biggest mistakes in life, one of them being his love for children, this very spirit, he felt so strongly about, was the one component that took him down. How this and many other incidents created a darkness that would haunt him to the very end. No one could have faced what Jackson had endured during his years, the despondency, pain, fears and his uncertainties in life.<br />Business folks who took advantage of his kindness created mistrust, and made life for Jackson a delusional world of ambiguity.<br /><br />\\"Defending a King,\\" won't resolve any really issues, it only briefly gives you a synopsis of what it's like to a huge icon with it the excess baggage and what a legend has to endure in a world of greed, bleeding him of everything he had until there was no more. Especially the trial of 2005 and what that had done to the very core of Jackson, emotionally and physically. It's a powerful insight to what this man went through to some point -a good honest read for anyone.
B0041KVW2K|4.0|So far, I have purchased 4 different titles. Help, Revolver, Rubber Soul, and Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club band. I am happy with all but one, and that is \\"Sgt Peppers\\". I have purchased and exchange 3 different copies and I am having the same problem. The last one was from a completely different store so I could make sure it was not from the same batch.<br /><br /> Side one, tracks 4,5,6 & 7. All have distorted sound like I have fuzz clinging to the needle of the cartridge. I tried everything that I know to clean and adjust the tonearm to see if that would correct the issue. No luck. Side two is perfect.<br /><br />This is something that is always a problem when pressing vinyl LP's. With such a big event like this, there has to be a few. I remember having sometimes to exchange several copies to get a decent one when a new top selling record came out. It comes with the territory.<br /><br /> All in all, I am still happy with the idea that they have reissued these. Used vinyl has its problems as well. All the manufacturer has to do is make everyone happy with the various issues. You can't test every pressing coming off of the stampers.<br /><br />I plan to purchase most of the catalog separately. The packaging is wonderful and top notch. The sound quality other than the problems I previously mentioned is outstanding. To try and purchase the whole British catalog used in good condition is very difficult. This is a bargain if I ever saw one. Don't let the other reviews dissuade you from purchasing these if you are a true Beatles fan.<br /><br />All we can do is note the problems and let others know of the warnings. And in the end, every one should be OK.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A great movie made greater through the 3-d medium. I hightly reccomend this version of the movie for anyone owning a 3-d TV
B008KP2VZY|5.0|I have tried several other programs but this has one feature that I have not found in others.  You can use it to rename a file, it does not seem to change the case of an extention though.  It is well worth the price.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|It always amazes me, that in the 21st century 86% of humanity still believes in gods and religious symbols. I am fortunate enough to be living at this time in history where I can see in real time the evolution from blind faith to substantiated fact.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Not sure what all the hubbub is with the negative comments. I loved this movie. Great space adventure.<br /><br />Make no hesitation in spending your nickels and dimes on this one.<br /><br />Do. It.
B006C3Q6GG|5.0|This is the first book in the amazing series of Jack Aubrey novels.  I liked how it introduced the friendship between Aubrey and Maturin.  It was interesting to compare and contrast this with the first of the Hornblower series.  It seemed like this one had a little more nautical detail and a little less je ne sais quoi.  However, I've just re-read both series and loved them both as much this time as last time. If you were raised in the sight of water, or wish you were, try this book.  You might just get hooked....
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Would give this 6 stars if possible. Keeps getting better everytime I listen to it. Can't wait for more from this unique and talented group.
B004J88SGC|2.0|Recently purchased this DVD and thought the concert was electrifying. Great sound and the picture was amazing.<br />Complaint : There is no BONUS PERFORMANCES!!! No Steve Tyler, Roger Daltrey, or John Mellencamp. Not to be found on this DVD.
B004HW7JH4|4.0|Very good as usual, in fact, one of my very favorites; however, i was surprised to see many former episodes included:  ie:  the surprise birthday party, the howard johnsons trip, the elevator scene when Megan meets an old girlfriend of his, and he is quite ill, and in his dream he chokes the old girlfriend.  It was like i had seen most of it before;; however, i have not watched it on tv, so wondered if there could have been a mistake in packaging!
B005FISBV2|1.0|As others have noted, the way these DVDs are authored, you are forced to sit through a long promotional sequence for Showtime that shows the climax of the season.<br /><br />That's not the only problem with the authoring.  Unlike some (but not all) of the other seasons, you cannot skip through the recap and opening credits by using the skip forward button.  Instead of taking you to the actual beginning of the episode, it jumps you 5-10 minutes into it.<br /><br />Worst DVD authoring in the history of DVD authoring.<br /><br />The show is great, but don't reward these fools for their incompetence by buying these discs.  Borrow from a friend, get them on Netflix if you have it, or find a legal way to see it for free.
B004TTZHBK|5.0|Wish he would add more videos.  I haven't used the recipes but I learned a ton just by watching his video tips.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|For those of us who can't get enough of Fagen's solo stuff, \\"Sunken Condos\\" delivers big time! Not being able to decide between \\"Slinky Thing,\\" \\"I'm Not the Same Without You,\\" or \\"Weather in My Head,\\" as my favorite is a quandary that I look forward to pondering for decades to come! Bravo Donald!
B0077SGMXM|4.0|I wish you could play with your saved game on multiple devices.  I hate that I have different saved progress on my tablet and phone.  Otherwise this would be 5 stars for sure.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|An engaging account written from the perspective of a dog. Good insights. The auto racing provides a framework, but another framework could also have served the purposes. For me, it was the dog's sharply expressed views,rather than the framework into which they were cast,that was the principal story.
B004ZH66XO|4.0|I thought it was going to be a feed your fish game, but it was much more.  I wish the powerups were more unique, but they are still cool.  Good game.
B008220C92|3.0|Ethan Hawke does a great job of presenting a writer who is coming unhinged but the stock writing of a demonic creature trying to kill his family is poorly conceived. There are few moments of true terror and the ones that do come are at the expense of the family children which reinforces the desperate efforts at trying to elicit horror. When the moment comes and the main antagonist is revealed all I could think of was a really bad Scream mask. Wait for DVD.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|Very unique game, new concept, not the same game over and over again.  Challenging yet not impossible.  Check it out for yourself.  The best part about all of these 'apps' is they are so cheap to even just try.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|My grandson is 5 and just loves it. I enjoy playing it too. It is simple but fun to try and figure it out.
B005V20JKI|4.0|Takes wayyyyy too long to level though.  I have been just playing for so long to try to unlock all of the upgrades and it has become un-fun.  I wish there were adventure type levels also to play.
B004UID2LC|3.0|Ok, apart from having this app for over 8 months and JUST deleting it today, I tell you, don't buy this app!! If you want some nice downloads sure its good for that, but if you have this app for over 5 months&hellip;yeah, its ganna not download anything anymore. Maybe its just my Kindle Fire, but no, this app is a no-no.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|tons of fresh levels for those of you who played the original.  This game is always fun to play.  How could you not try it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is very fun it has a lot of action. I think everyone will enjoy this game.my fav. thing about this game is that it has those little minion guys are soscared of him. YOu cancutomise your character into anything you want to.

B004YM6JLO|4.0|I have enjoyed The Vampire Diaries from the first season. The second season being my favorite so far. This season wasn't as good as the second season but still worth watching just to learn more about the original family.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I have all of Susan's albums and as much as I love her & her voice, I have always been disappointed because she seems to have been bound down by the arrangement given her, in this album she soars again! What a joy! I do agree with another reviewer that she could have done better with \\"Over the Rainbow\\" if left to herself. The duets are ok, it certainly shows her amazing talent to sing in so many ways, but I totally prefer her alone. Thank you Susan for letting us soar again with you in your amazing voice.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game so much because it is a lot like the Pc version of alpha way back when. I do think this app is starting to catch up to xbox an Pc versions. cant wait till amazon lets out v. 0.5.0 alpha!!!!!!!

B009ZXT4BY|1.0|I just installed this game and the controls sucked. everything was terribly oriented so I couldn't even move very well. I just wanted to try a game like minecraft other than minecraft. I'm definitely sticking with minecraft pe
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I never thought I could enjoy a book narrated by Death, but I truly loved this book.  I would highly recommend it.
B0091REZMW|3.0|has a lot of things to do but a little more instruction would be nice. i just know i am running around looking in rooms for stuff until i can get into a new room. oh and another game where you run out of &quot;credits&quot; or whatever and you have to buy more to get anything accomplished otherwise its going to take FOREVER.
B003CN5SAY|5.0|I enjoyed the final season, and felt that the ending was very apropoe to the show. It DID leave me wondering a bit about what was going to happen with Christian though.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Love Jessica Lange as well as all the rest! The show is just as good if not better than the first season!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Great movie, too bad pirating it before I pay money to own it is something that I dont like doing, however studios refuse to release to all markets at the same time. Really, I shouldnt even buy the disk until its in the $5 bin, but I'll have it when I get back from my trip.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|Harold Fry is one of my favourite characters of 2012! His transformation during his journey was heart-warming,sad but also humorous. All of the other characters supported Harold's adventures as he completed his pilgrimage. I loved this book.

B009G7ZYPY|5.0|After last year's lackluster album, I was quite surprised to hear that Susan was releasing another album... 4 in 4 years!!! But I gotta say, this is great!!! Beautiful vocals, fabulous orchestration and amazing duets.... My favorite duet is \\"All I Ask of You\\" with Donny Osmond.... Donny's voice is incredible, and he and Susan compliment each other so well.... In an age where music really disappoints, its so nice to be able to enjoy a well crafted album!!!
B000JQU4TW|5.0|I love the book for the writhing style. The plot is attention grabbing and keeps you guessing until the end. Not for younger people but a great gift for older avid readers.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I was SO disappointed in the last book (Kill Shot) I was hesitant to get this one.  I'm a big Mitch Rapp fan.  I have the whole series that I've read at least twice, so I went ahead and got it.  This book is GREAT!!  Great story with lots of Mitch.  If you enjoy seeing the bad guys \\"get theirs\\", this is the book for you!  Now I'm back to anxiously awaiting the next book!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|37 chapters?! Really?! But that's what makes it good. 6 words: THIS NEEDS TO BE A MOVIE!!!!! And this is a 7 star book.
B009YU62H2|4.0|Leading up to King Animal's release, I had worry in the back of my mind this new album simply wouldn't sound like Soundgarden. The crux of the worry was Cornell's work over the past decade. While not \\"bad\\" work (I enjoyed some Audioslave, for instance), it certainly wasn't anything like Soundgarden, who by my (and many others) estimation are the closest thing to Led Zeppelin we've seen in the last 30 years. If this turned into a hybrid of Cornell's mellow, much less \\"moody\\" solo work with the powerful, dynamic and brooding Soundgarden, it just wouldn't taste right.<br /><br />My worries were squashed away with this album. While there is the occasional moment that might remind you of Cornell's solo work (Halfway There comes to mind), this album is thoroughly Soundgarden. Right off the bat, the bridge in intro track and single \\"Been Away Too Long\\" screams classic Soundgarden and SG-era Cornell vocal phrasing. \\"And no one KNOWS me! No one SAVES me!\\" Worse Dreams sounds like it could come right off of Superunkown and nobody would have blinked an eye. Haunting tune with a wicked baseline and dark melody. Kim sounds like he didn't miss a beat, his lead work, eery sound effects, and erratic guitar solos reminding me of yesteryear. Cameron and Shepard pull the chaos together into dynamic grooves (Sheperd in particular seems to have a big impact on this album, his baselines pulling you in and never letting go). Little moments like these put away my worries these guys would sound like some weird abomination of themselves. I feel at home listening to King Animal. With that said, I always shy away from comparing band's work to previous works. I prefer to sit back, absorb, and experience as anew without comparisons. With that mindset, King Animal hit me hard. In a very good way.<br /><br />Personally, I find any criticism of this album pointless. Null and void. This album could have never happened, and I feel completely blessed to have been able to experience this album, especially since they represent themselves well with the new music. Is this Badmotorfinger ala 1991 Soundgarden? No. But you're out of your mind if you expected such a thing. It's 2012, these guys are around 50 years old, were apart more than a dozen years, and have proven by their live performances and now new music: They are still legends. They are still Soundgarden, through and through.<br /><br />King Animal proves these guys are still great. It doesn't tarnish their legend, it simply helps it grow and evolve. I'm going to sit back and enjoy Soundgarden while I have the chance. We've all grown, we've all changed, but that isn't a bad thing. I was heartbroken in 1997, and I feel like a long lost friend has returned from a long absence. Welcome back, Soundgarden. We missed you.
B000KX0IOA|4.0|The Movie Ghandi is a 1982 film that brings Mohamdas Karamchand Ghandi's life to the silver screen. Ghandi who was a hindu lawyer preached non-violent independence and eventually it would be somewhat successful but would ultimately cost him his life. The film begins basically during the end of Ghandi's life as he being shown shot to death by an assassin in public view. In this horrendous scene as he is shot, Ghandi utters to what I believe is \\"Oh God\\". After this scene the movie begins to reset back in time and Ghandi is shown in South Africa attempting to ride a train first class but is told he has to ride the train third class instead because of his minority status. Ghandi refuses this act and is thrown off the train. Throughout the movie Ghandi's protest of non-violent movements is very well observed. He's all about creating equality and bringing an end to racial oppression.<br /><br />As the movie progresses the train incident resulted in a number of arrests for Ghandi. Ghandi seemed to persuade the goverenment to recognize rights for the Indians. By doing this Ghandi was now considered a hero and begin to put up a fight for Indians' independence. He helped establish villages where people would work and share common things. He is now gettine famous in South Africa and the world also. Throughout the movie Ghandi is imprisoned for years in South Africa. In 1915 he is released and returns to India to be with his family. He wants to create a low profile upon returning to India, but it is not meant to be he has to face the notion the he is a hero now and there are many people that depend on him to keep mthe independent movement going. Ghandi is well known for some of the most notable events that took place in Indian history in the twentieth century. Ghandi was eventually arrested again for leading a workers strike that would really hurt the nation. Indian soilders begin to mount up and eventually kill many women, men, and children while Ghandi was in prison. These killings would come under the command of The British General Dyer. Ghandi is released and goes to Britian and begins to negotiate with officials for Indian independence. The battle between the Hindus and the Muslims (who were the minority I may add) struck great violence. Ghandi would fasst in order to stop the violence and as a result would almost starve to death.<br /><br />India is finally granted independence but it would come at a steep price because the British goverenment also would grant Pakistan independence (Muslims). Ghandi still didn't give up his non-violent ways or beliefs, and he understood that peace, justice, and equality was the way to achieve happiness. He would be mourned by thousands and thousands of people who would come from all over the world to show respect and love and to let it be known that this was a senseless act that took place on January 30, 1948.<br /><br />The way this movie is related to World Religions is because Ghandi believed that everyone is considered equal in God's eyes. He was really a great leader that stressed non-violence and his faith is very well displayed in the movie as he is involved in several religious based movements for one's equality. Ghandi remained faithful during all those years he was in prison and he kept the same principles and goals and never gave up no matter the cost and that would eventually be his life.  Great Movie!!

B00A0A6F7C|2.0|This is all very nice, the music holds drama, brings tears...and the songs are simply the best out there. But to the people who think THIS is the new Collection To Have of dramatic broadway songs...I need you to know that what you really need to listen to is SANDI PATTY: BROADWAY STORIES.  Sandi Patty is similar in 'vocal age' to Susan Boyle, but simply unbeatable. If you want dramatic vocals and high notes, Sandi's are the fullest and highest. If you want emotional story-telling and gentle vocals, Sandi delivers with a presence like non other. And if you want the most stirring rendition of \\"Send in the Clowns\\" (with the most gorgeous lush orchestration I might add) then check out Sandi's performance on SANDI PATTY: BROADWAY STORIES. There are numerous songs in common on these 2 CDs, so if you find yourself interested in Susan's choice of repertoire, you really owe it to yourself to check out the honesty, power, and emotion of SANDI PATTY'S collection released last year: BROADWAY STORIES. The orchestral arrangements sparkle behind Sandi's incredible voice!<br /><br />LISTEN HERE! [[ASIN:B005RTTQKY Sandi Patty: Broadway Stories]]
B0083V2VW8|5.0|Great buy. The film looks excellent, especially the scenes taking place at night. Noticed things I've never seen before, it was like watching the movie for the first time. Great bonus features too and the packaging and title screens are exceptionally well done.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I decided to finally step-up and read this series after seeing the series on HBO.  Convenient right?  Anyway, I found the first book to be amazingly accurate to what was shown on tv.  That is to say; Thank God that there is finally an action/adventure/historical fiction-styled series that does not bore me to death or end up being exactly the opposite of what it promises to be.  I have attempted to read stories that either are way too underdeveloped, or suddenly turn from something with potential to something that becomes some sort of dead attempt at a love story.<br /><br />A Song of Ice and Fire was able to catch my attention and keep it.  The way that the book was written, hopping from the perspectives of several individual characters, made the story seem whole and complete.  Each character was believable, as were the story lines.  There is enough real-life intrigue and experience that is seems totally plausible that the story could be real.  I do not want to go into extreme detail here, so just trust me when I say that I am incredibly picky about my books, and I found this one to be very hard to put down.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My husband and I really enjoy watching this series. Normally I would stay away from zombie movies and shows, but I had been told that I would like \\"The Walking Dead\\" because of the rich character development. It is outstanding!

042524489X|4.0|I am smitten with the series and the story of Hawke and Sienna has been my most anticipated yet. The author carries the mythology and the overarching story line to new heights, ramping up the danger and the consequences. My only quibble is with interweaving an additional love story between Lara and Walker, plus the birth of Lucas and Sascha's child. Because the love interests spend so much of their time focusing on the 'feelings' via alternating POV's, having additional romantic story lines detracts from the primary emphasis on the major characters. I have nothing against secondary characters enjoying their time in the sun, but it should not pull attention away from the action and the primary romantic elements. Ergo, I'm giving this 4-stars despite this book being my (current) favorite in the series.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I remember those fun games when I was little. Brings back a lot of memories. Although some prizes such as the whistle is really to hard to get. Other than that no complaints on the mechanics of the game.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app a lot it JUST NEEDES AN UPDATE. and you need to be able to make roollor coasters!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really like the size of the number easy to read and it fills up your whole entire screen. No complaints that I know of.
B0095R4M8A|5.0|Neither 1 I would recommend for<br /> everyone to see the older movies are better than the newer ones very good family movies
B008TMA1LY|3.0|It's a fun game at start but it's a kinda game that won't last forever(in terms of fun) unless you start purchasing stuff with real money
B0079J28NW|5.0|What more can be added to all the other reviews of this iconic Beatles classic?  Yellow Submarine on Blu-ray is a wonderful addition to any Beatle fan's collection.  It has quickly become my daughter's favorite movie! The music makes us all smile, of course, and she loves to sing along with all of the songs.  We couldn't be happier!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Wow! I love Minecraft! This app has no problems and is great! (p.s. next time you play make the seed this: chest<br />It has lava and when you play on survival a huge cave with a waterfall is a mob spawner.)
B0041KVW2K|2.0|Like many others, I received a defective box set.<br />All 16 albums had the same problem:<br />  The spindle hole is not centered correctly, causing the tone arm to waver from side to side as it plays.<br />That slight movement creates surface noise you'll hear when beginning the record, and damages the cartridge and needle.<br /><br />Second: Abbey Road would not track at all, the needle simply jumped across the vinyl.<br /><br />I discovered by researching online that US copies of this most important music was done at Rainbo pressing plant.<br />Rainbo has a reputation for inconsistent pressings, and a consistent lack of quality control. They are famous for being budget friendly.<br />Why would Apple spend years working on the digital re-mastering with such great attention to every detail, only to hand that work over to a second rate pressing plant?<br />I am stunned by their decision to save money, and present the public with a grossly sub par product like this.<br />I have returned my set to Amazon for a full refund.<br /><br />Then I looked into a UK set in hope that UK pressings would be better.<br />But after reading reviews on Amazon.UK, I discovered many people having issues with warping of the UK pressings.<br />Also, UK pressings with shipping to the US would cost double the price.<br />Any hopes of this box being added to my collection have been dashed.<br /><br />I share my experience in the hope it may help others with their decision to purchase this set or not.<br />The box set was physically beautiful; the book was stunning and of the highest quality.  Album covers were all glossy and true to the originals.<br />Amazon did a fine job with shipping.<br /><br />For me, the most important part of this set is quality of sound.<br />I believe Apple betrayed themselves and the fans with the choice of going to a budget pressing plant.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Exciting, thought-provoking, well-written and wonderful. Highly recommend!  I can't wait to dig into his other series. Keep it up Hugh!
B0098VYCCE|2.0|but at one point in the movie it was uber fake looking. And Kristen Stewart always looks like she's trying to be sexy with her mouth open, but it isn't working!
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Was going to write a long detailed review about this movie, but it's far easier to just say, this really is nothing like Alien/Aliens and IMHO has an even weaker story then Alien 3/Alien Resurrection.  I won't bother ever watching it again.<br /><br />If you're looking for another sci-fi movie with great CGI creatures who kill the occasional person, then you'll prolly like it because the mix of plot holes and predicable story line won't bother you so much.  The movie spoon feeds you most of the plot and then occasionally one of the characters will just blurt out something they \\"know\\" but has no reason to and you're left wondering WTF just happened.  This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't that most of these things are key plot points.  Most of the \\"surprises\\" you'll see coming a mile away.<br /><br />A weak antagonist with motives which seem to change for no reason really hurts this movie and there are scenes which really should of been left on the editing floor as they do nothing other then provide yet another battle, but do absolutely nothing to move the story forward.<br /><br />Simply put, I'm glad my wife and I only paid $5 to watch it at home, but even at that price I think we might of paid too much.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I ran across this by mistake and LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this show. I was an X-Files fan, and love the similarities, but I like these characters better. Love Walter's quirks.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|I love this app you can collect cute hats after u beat levels and you can put them on your jellyfish it is the cutest and funnest game ever plaing levels and dressing up a cute jellyfish now whats better than that
B0088TG252|2.0|I'm ready to see Denzel in a role where he's not playing a badass. Love ya Denz, but you need to mix it up some.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer - Excellent plot. I couldn't get off reading it. At one point I thought it was over but still there were 200 pages left and it made a 180 degrees turn in the plot and with Grisham's exclusive style deloped a new unexpected plot that kept me glued to the book.<br /><br />I finished it in three days!<br /><br />Irecommend it to anyone that likes police, investigative and twisted plots.
B004GTLFNW|5.0|I've decided to give a try to one of recommended programs before writing any review, so here is my veredict.<br /><br />I've been following the 1st Class Program for 10 weeks, without any break, and in few words, it really worked. I'm now in much better physical condition, my main muscles grown as never before and I'm very fit.<br /><br />Before I started this book, I was going to the gym 5 days a week for 5 months and the results were much worse that this 10 weeks.<br />Actually, I did all the progam in the same gym, but following just the book exercises. I stopped with all weight and my shoulders stopped hurting me, so this exercises made me stronger and without pain.<br /><br />I recommend it to everyone, just does not forget to get the right nutrition (as substitue to pure protein, I've been using Soja's Milk and Milk, about a 1/2 a liter of each one after the exercise). Do not let the exercises feel easy, just put in out of confort for every single exercise that you preform.<br /><br />Good luck!<br /><br />For now, I'll be resting for a week and then I'll try the next level, the Master Class Program.
8866131768|5.0|The layout is great and convinient, and the front cover is motivational. A great buy even if I bought it later in the year. There are stickers that come with the planner, but they are given in limited amounts. Still, the smooth paper and minimalist design make up for it.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|I saw this movie opening night.  What can I say, other than I laughed through the last three quarters of the film.  It is obviously made to be taken seriously.  And if your idea of a great, intellectually stimulating movie is \\"power rangers\\", then this is for you.  With out spoiling any of the plot, if you can find one, this is basically a slasher film in space.  \\"Scientists\\" (and this term is used very loosely) go into space seeking first contact.  The crew of the first ever interstellar ship is manned with people from an insane asylum, and sent to investigate alien ruins.  It would have been a much better film, if it had been shot with Will Ferrell or Adam Sandler as the lead.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have little time for casual reading, but I made time for this book. It was great to take my mind off of the hectic pace of life.<br />Sad this was the third and final book in the trilogy. Now what shall I read?
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I cant believe how disappointing this movie was! The first half hour was not so bad but the rest...a complete waste of time. This movie goes no where and not quickly. It takes two hours to get there.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are so talented. I play this cd in my car all the time since I bought it.  So uplifting. I downloaded the cd into my ITumes so I can have on my IPhone. Hope they do another one soon.  Their YTube videos are awesome.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This book is a much better than John Grisham's last couple of books. It has a good plot with a surprising twist.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Some of the most raw, most soulful, hardest rocking, musical songs I have ever heard. Playing is phenomenal. No one has ever done this better! BCC has surpassed the excellence of their first two releases. Based upon interviews I have read on the internet, the band sounds strained and may not have another release.  So sad.  These musicians compliment each other so well.  Three thousand CDs and counting in my collection and this rates at the top!
B008YWY0HK|5.0|This movie is amazing! It's beautiful, funny, touching... and a good, fast-paced story that will keep both  children and adults, boys and girls entertained.<br /><br />Princess Merida doesn't want to be \\"just\\" a Princess-- she wants to carve her own path, her own destiny, and show what she can really DO in this world... and in so doing, she learns not only can a lady be a fighter-- but that a fighter can be a lady...<br /><br />There are bits in there for the entire family, and you're missing out if you don't watch this gem, plus the animation is just beautiful and the story is amazingly original. It's not a one-dimensional damsel story or a two-dimensional girl-power story, either. It's about the power of FAMILY, and LOVE... and it's just adorably raucous and funny. (King Fergus, Queen Helena and the Princes, Hubert, Hamish and Hargus... adorable. Plus, I just love the accents and the music... can't recommend this highly enough. I didn't think they could outdo [[ASIN:B005ZMUXDC Tangled]], which I ADORE, but they've managed it...
0345803507|5.0|I can't say enough about the Greys books!! They speak to a woman's heart, exactly what we dream of in many ways. Liberation, Security, Love, Sex, ..... Fabulous!! I'm really sad to see the series end and I hope more books are made like this!! I hear they maybe making a movie and for that I am very excited!!
B000028U0Y|5.0|Bought this LP album years ago and loved it then.  It is just as good now if not better with more songs.  Highly recommend it.
B000ICXQGK|4.0|I enjoy Robin William's in off beat non comedic roles and this is certainly one of them. The artistry and visual tools used are very intriguing yet the reason I purchased this was for the heaven/hell/suicide/power of love conflict. Film brought out many interesting dilemmas. And Cuba's performance is always solid.
B002XOTPU2|4.0|Being a fan of Simon's Cat on youtube for a few years, it was awesome to read about the kitteh antics on my kindle.  Scary how I can relate these stories to my own kitteh.<br /><br />Can't wait to get the other ones!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|It's the same base: an average yong girls that doesn't think much about herself meets the manf of her life. He is rich, beautiful and interested in her. he difference is that while in twilight the prince was a vampire, here it is a sadist. But Love cures everything!!!!!!!! it's a plagiarism. Not a surprise the same actress is being offered the role.
0760703329|4.0|the book is exactly as you would expect, & it's pretty too.  i needed it for reference material & the price was right.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I played this on my DS once upon a time, and I didn't quite realize that when I bought it, but guess what! like all FF games you can play them more than once because they are so awesome! well, well worth the $16!
B006TVQTHW|4.0|A great case for the money.  Lots of extra fan locations.  Great weight to the case.  Not flimsy at all.<br /><br />Pros - Lots of interior room,  Great cable management possibilities, USB 3.0 on front of case, Plenty of USB ports on the rear, Love the fan on the back of the MB, Twin Fan locations on front keep lots of airflow going into the case.<br /><br />Cons - Stock fans do not push much air so it is very easy to have positive pressure inside of the case.  Wish the stock fan controllers used a traditional Molex 4 pin or 3 pin MB connections.  Instead they are custom 2 pin connection so switching out the fans is next to impossible.<br /><br />Other than the stock fans this case is a great buy for the money.
B000021Y7X|5.0|This film shows us everything that makes the Talking Heads, the Talking Heads.  David Byrne's exuberant personality shines in this epic showing of everything the talking heads are known for!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The final book in a trilogy that rivals the Harry Potter series (in my opinion, at least). I wish there were more of them!
B009VB7QQA|4.0|I enjoy a bit of history in a movie, even though not completely accurate. Action scenes were excellent!! Good movie on a 60\\" Panasonic plasma. Tim Burton is the best!
B005FISBTO|5.0|One if the best shows ever! I own every season (I consider myself a movie/TV collector), and I have friends constantly asking to borrow them!
B000FC1K66|5.0|Good Read.  Held your attention from start to finish. The characters were not over described nor was the scenery. Would recommend to anybody.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I bought this immediately after finishing The Hunger Games, and I read it in two days. Need I say more?
0670026182|5.0|I have just purchased my second copy of this book and sent it to my daughter who lives in NY. She received it this morning and sent me a text saying &#34;mum it's amazing&#34;. She left it with her boyfriend for a short time, also a food lover, suggesting he mark some of recipes he liked and when she returned he had &#34;marked every page&#34;. What I love about this book is the honesty of the recipe description and seasonal focus with ingredients that are not<br />so obscure they would be tricky to source. The photography is painterly and beautiful. Thank you for creating this marvellous work of art .... that can be eaten!
B007LB5MF4|4.0|I have to say this is a beautiful work.  The art is just a feast for the eyes on every page.  I've seen the show, and there is more detail here.  The story flows nicely, but it is long.  It's more than a one sitting read for sure.  I'd say even if you know the story, this is worth the money just for a flip through the art alone.  I've seen where some people say the characters are a little too perfect, and perhaps that is true, but that aside, the full page panels in here are the kind of stuff you could hang on your wall.  Get it, or at the very least borrow it on prime and take a look!!
B0086700CM|4.0|Having trouble putting my KF down after I downloaded this app. Great UI and all. I recommend it to anyone with time to kill. oh yeah it's offline too.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I am a fan of what I deem low-key english literature and I would recommend The Casual Vacancy to all who want a quiet read on a cloudy afternoon. J.K. Rowling has made the characters  quite interesting in that you begin to care about them. Many things are going on in the small town, but it's all handled with british dignity.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Great!  It is very easy to use and its very fun just like the computer. This application has made Pinterest a very convineint way to pin on the go.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Movies are always up to one's personal taste and opinions.  Having said that, I (and anyone who has watched them with me) completely enjoyed all of these movies.  I have had at least 3 marathons with various friends watching these, and I never get bored of seeing any of them again.  I usually see a movie only once, and that's enough, but not with these.<br /><br />Seeing them in chronological storyline order all in the same day brought all the different elements together, and the whole story made more sense.  Every time I have a marathon, I pick up on something new that I did not realize before.  I might have a Star Wars party someday and have my friends dressed as characters come over for lunch, dinner, and drinks, and watch the movies!  There is at least a total of 12 hours of viewing pleasure, so if you plan a marathon too, keep this in mind!<br /><br />Also, I like the small additions to the original movies with new scenes that relate back to the prequels; it helps bring the total storyline together.  For example, at the end of \\"Return of the Jedi,\\" new scenes from other cities in the universe are added that include celebrations of the victory over the Empire.  In addition, with these movies in Blu-ray, the picture is very clean, crisp and lifelike.<br /><br />These movies are a true delight, and I highly recommend getting this collection!  It's worth every penny.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|very realistic and fun to play.  I can't wait to play this game on my Fire 8.9 when it arrives!!!
B0002DRBX4|5.0|I 1st rented this movie when it came out in the 90's. Since I was a Beavis and Butthead fan I was curious about the movie since Mike Judge wrote it.<br />Well flash forward to 2012 and I own the dvd and watch it when i have friends over and if I'm flipping channels it is sometimes on Comedy cental and I always find myself watching there too! My work partners ,friends,  and I are always quoting lines from the movie. Either lines from Lumberg , Peter Gibbons, or the \\"O\\" face guy. I still see many things from this movie to be very relative to the corporate workplace and that is what make the movie so funny. I hope you all enjoy this Movie as much as I do and watch it many many times!!!!
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|I am using these as outdoor lights that are on a light sensitive switch - they come on at dusk and stay on till morning.  Replaced two 65W bulbs with these....that's 10% of the energy use!  I'm happy.  They flicker a bit, not sure if its the cold weather or our lousy wiring ... pretty sure its not the bulb, as they seemed fine indoors in a regular lamp.  Can't really comment on the color temperature or how they would work indoors, I'm happy with them outside.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|This game was awesome.. can't wait for part 2. I will challenge myself next time by using less hints.. Definitely worth. 99&cent;
B0070XFNDE|4.0|I loved the previous books, so I highly anticipated this book. However this one seemed to be about filling in details. I think I need to go back and read the other two again. On the other hand these books have my favorite characters. I don't reread many books, but for those I truly like I do read multiple times. So this falls on the multiple read list. But I did want more from this book.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Just when I thought it couldn't get better, bam! It just gets crazier and crazier. Awesome.  I can't wait to watch more.
B0091XRL86|5.0|My kids and husband really enjoyed this movie, I on the other hand wasn't fond of the clay animation, but that is just my opinion.  The kids and husband really liked it though.
B008M62KJI|5.0|you can never go wrong with swing out sister...another true soul filled treat from a group that continues to groove to the true soul of the beat...
1419705849|5.0|My son loves these books, so far we have every one and this one did not dissapoint at all.  He loved it.
B008RXYOKY|4.0|This adapter is, arguably, a little klunkier than it needs to be, but I like it that way. The short length of flexible cord makes it more versatile. It's easy to pack, less prone to breakage, less prone to damage the socket on the compter, and harder to lose than a short rigid single piece adapter would be.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great book for those who have followed the career antics of John and Kate Corey.  John's wisecracks are funny, but being inside his head for the entire book got a little tiresome.  It took a long time to get to a very exciting ending, but was worth the wait.  Overall a great Nelson DeMille book as per his usual.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Was blown away how great this was!! Everyone kept telling me how it was a great story, and I thought that it would just be about all the sex in the story. I was suprised, and loved the love story!
B008RV5K5E|5.0|If only they did the voice over this would be the best Batman ever, even without it the story is still great. Can't wait until part 2.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Can not get enough of this story! I read this on my phone, the whole series! Could not put it down!! As soon as I finished one book, right away I would buy the next!!
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Come the camp and the one liners are what make this movie great. Yeah the special effects are dated but Bruce Campbell is at his best here.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|One of the best books ever! Did not want it to end!! I am still waiting for the movie! I miss reading this story.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not his best book.  Had a hard time to follow the characters and storyline.  But it was entertaining anyway and will probably give him another chance if he comes out with something new.
1611761069|3.0|I am not much on writing reviews and mine are very short. Nothing different with this review.<br /><br />It's been years since I read or listened to audio version of this Cornwell series. In fact, I totally missed where the book was written in third person? Anyway, I decided to get the audio version of the book. I like Kate Reading as the narrator.<br /><br />First, I really enjoyed the story itself. Let me say that up front. Now, for the review.<br /><br /> The first thing that hit me was that every charactor in this book (exception Marino and Benton) either didn't like Scarpetta, or Scarpetta didn't like them, or both! No one trusts anyone. And, everyone has ulterior motives for everything they do. At least from Scarpetta's view and this book is written in first person.<br /><br />Then, the relationship with Benton, Scarpetta, and Marino is the same dianamic it's always been. No one laughs or even seem to enjoy being around each other. What kind of disfunction marriage does Kay and Benton have? Very, in my opinion. The only charactor that is truly a fun person is Marino. Some of the stuff he comes up with truly caused me to laugh out loud as I listened to the narrator. Kay and Benton were downers all the time. I could never \\"feel\\" any of the charactors smile or even show real emotion (except Marino).<br /><br />Anyway, that's why 3 stars. I'll probably go back to not getting any more of these in the series.
B004AQR24W|1.0|Couldn't get past the first scene.  Trying to catch the video game crowd I'd guess, but it's just bad.  I wanted to like this one.
B008M721MS|5.0|Whoever made this App gets a double thumbs up. Ive tried rather hard and you cant get any feed back from it, even full blast music wont get you feed back on the Kindle Fire HD. Rather easy to use, and has some good settings options that i not sure that exists in the pc version even thought it should. That bwing said, it doesnt have an its own volume control, so dont expect to watch or listen to anything while chatting with a friend.
B0053O89U6|4.0|I just have a simple question:  Why did the price go up about $15.00?  The show is a lot of fun, but please don't take advantage of our addiction.
B004V5A7K8|4.0|A nice little game you can grab. Just make sure you watch where your finger is, you might block the veiw of your bar.
B008D28HYS|5.0|Addicting, challenging fun game, I have played both the color and the non-color version, I expected this to be easier than the non color one, but its not.
B004HX4RT6|3.0|Its chess. Its right on the money if you expect just chess, but besides that nothing realy interesting. Would be a lot better if you could vs other players useing the app.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I bought it and it did not dawnload it says did not work try agin. after 300 times it finaly dawnloaded and went back to the app store and saw the 050 update and I have been waiting for the 050 update for almost months now I am so mad
B008458O3S|4.0|A good find. It has a nice skill climb so it doesnt get too hard to fast. Though it is hard to get into, lot of menues. Only recomend it if you have a couple mintues to play when you do play it.
0385535147|5.0|Grisham is my husband's favorite author. He hasn't been reading lately - FOOTBALL season! BUT, he's already started the book.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was using a different weather app before and it sucked!! It wouldnt update very often and it wasnt very accurate.<br />AccuWeather on the other hand is very accurate and I havent had problems with it so far. Im very satisfied. Definitelly recommend it!!
B0012GMXYM|5.0|Coming back to this after decades, first heard it in my student daze. Some of the finest jazz-rock ever. Superb production and musicianship - note the change of timing at the end of Life is Anew for example. Positive, happy, transcendent. Wow, what a great era for music! Return to Forever's \\"Romantic Warrior\\", Camel's \\"Mirage\\", Zappa's \\"One size fits all\\" and this ... bliss..
B00007E7K0|5.0|My camera had not had a cover for a long time, lost it a couple years ago.  This was ordered using just the specifics on the camera and it fits beautifully!
0857680986|5.0|Easy to follow. The illustrations are beautiful. Artists everywhere should get this book. This is absolutely a must have in any collection.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Standing Ovation is aptly named.  Susan truly should receive a  tremendous OVATION for every song in this album. At last, Susan sings GREAT SONGS with beautiful lyrics, commensurate with her MAGNIFICENT VOICE! And with perfect orchestral or simpler piano accompaniment allowing her VOICE to soar!  Even though I loved all her albums and every song therin, THIS Standing Ovation is THE BEST OF ALL.  I received my album copies from Amazon.com November  13th and have been blissfully listening almost  continually.  Can't get enough of Susan's voice.  Husband concurs that Susan has the most beautiful voice on the planet and we both are grateful that we have lived long enough to hear it!  How horrible it would have been to have missed Susan Boyle!<br />Ever grateful Susan Fans, BillnShirl from SBFII.
030759565X|5.0|I'm blown away by Deb's book. I've been a follower of her blog for years now, and while I prepordered the book in April 2012, I didn't expect it to blow me away. How could she possibly include so many new recipes? How could they be better than her website? Well, she did and they are! It's a truly spectacular cookbook filled with beautiful narrative, pictures, and superb recipes.<br />Fantastic work, Deb. Bravo.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is really cool. It works really good on the kindle fire. If you want a cool running game then temple run is the game for you.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|Very educational. I am not a runner, but had plenty of great info along with an engaging story woven through.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Its worth the $.99! Very cool features as well. Alarms are really loud...LMAO! But most of all, I got this for me and my wife because we both struggle to get up in the morning.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This game is awesome. Many don't remember great DOS games like Commander Keen, Crystal Caves, and the original side scrolling Duke Nukem. This game has the same feel with a better look. It takes me back. There is also a little Mega Man vibe too. I love this game and recommend it for all adults and children. I haven't had any issues with this app. Every Noodlecake app I have works great with no bugs on my Galaxy SIII before and after 4.1 update. I rarely write reviews yet I always read them before I download. I'll try to be more proactive and write regular reviews.<br /><br />This game offers a great challenge but no level is impossible. I admit I was quite frustrated on a few levels but three stars are achievable on every level. Good luck and I hope you enjoy this game as I have. My kids absolutely love this game, Pixel Twist and Jelly Flop. Pixel Twist... Don't get me started on that one. That beauty deserves 6 stars. It's a true work of art. Thank you to all of the developers. I appreciate your dedication and hard work. Please keep up the great work and don't lose the top notch quality you produce.
B0018QOIXU|4.0|While I enjoyed 21 more, 19 is still a great CD. Adele has an amazing voice. Chasing Pavements is my favorite on the CD but the cover of Garth Brooks' Make You Feel My Love is soulful.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|This was a real exciting movie that I was glad I rented.  I was in an area that did not have wifi so<br />the renting was a wonderful option.
034580404X|5.0|Friends said they could not put these books down. I would have to agree. These books are engrossing. Do not start to read if you have somewhere to be in the next 12 hours.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game but I hate all the ads that keep popping up when I'm trying to play the game.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|perfect distraction for a scattered brain, so much fun, addictive,  and in an odd way refreshing. I find myself continually picking up my kindle to play a few levels at a time.
0762445262|5.0|It is definitely MINI!  It's super cute and works well in a dark room.  Projects the bat signal clearly, a must have for Batman fans, can't wait to give this Christmas gift!
B007PFD90G|3.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Rushdie's struggle to live for a decade under a fatwa calling for his death. But it's as much about the author and his troubles - and his lame relationships with various wives - as about the writer's freedom to express his ideas. Rushdie was the author of a book satirizing aspects of the Prophet Mohammad's life and the object of a fatwa issued by the Ayatollah Komenei to kill the writer. Rushdi lived under constant guard hidden away for almost 10 years. His story is disturbing to anyone who believes in free expression, but his egotism and self-pity is annoying, as is his decision to refer to himself in this memoir in the third person.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Excellent APP for the price... no problems have used the game several times.. enjoy playing ..and love the 'hints' feature..
B003DNN0L2|1.0|I honestly can't believe how many people have given rave reviews of this movie. It was awful. Awful animation, awful dialog, and a truly awful adaptation of a great story by a great author.  Can't believe I sat through the whole thing.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Best Book Ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This can certinatly place first on someone's best book list. Hate newbery book judges. This book should get the medal
B009IU6N5Y|5.0|I watched this a few days ago---I thought it an unexpected and original storyline--great movie!  When's the video game coming out?
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS JUST AS OVER THE TOP AS I HAD BEEN TOLD IT WAS ;JUST STUNNING WONDERFULL; AMAZING A TRUE DELIGHT........
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft I would get it but the price is expensive I wish I could get it though.........my mom wouldn't let me
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Beautiful colours. Nice movie. Really enjoyed it. Nice way to pass a Friday night for those who don't hang out.
B0041KVW2K|3.0|First, Unless your an audiophile, disregard everything you've read about digital quality recordings pressed onto vinyl. The mastering on this set is superb. The sound is not fatiguing when you listen to an entire LP, the music is pressed a bit more quieter than the original releases and a bit more dynamic. If your looking for the same sound you had in your old UK/US vinyl, you wont find it here. According to the engineer who mastered these, they sound closer to the original tapes. I enjoy this new set much more than my older records.<br /><br />The packaging is first rate, the thick book is beautiful. The album sleeves do not replicate of the 1960's sleeves. Again this box was not meant to be a reissue of the older records and packaging. So if your looking for replicas, this set is not for you.<br /><br />The big draw back... The quality of the records themselves are not good. Half of the records in my box have problems, ranging from the no-fill scratching (sounds like a zipper) to complete distortion through some songs.  I'm not even bothered by pops and clicks, but expect a few, this is vinyl!<br /><br />It's been suggested that this is a first pressing, so maybe an improved set will follow. One thing is certain, either EMI or the record pressing plant should be ashamed of their (lack of) quality control. The three stars is an average rating.  5 stars on music, sound quality and packaging and 1 star for quality of the records themselves.<br /><br />Note:<br />I did get a replacement set that was poorly shipped from Amazon, the record set loose in a large box with some (popped) air pillows.
0385535147|4.0|This was one of the better Grisham's but not quite A Time to Kill.  Lots of plot twists so that you are hanging until the end.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun game, lots of possibilities of how your town grows and takes shape. I was expecting the old Oregon trail, this is better.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and did not want to put it down.  The story was sad, but good. I appreciated that it wasn't full of teen angst cliches.
B0030BOCEG|5.0|To bad this wasn't the Ultimate Collectors Version (The T-Shirt one), Still this is a great album. The Second disc (The Acoustic Version) was amazing.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  It is good in both storyline and cinematography.  I'll probably watch it more than once.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|I love the franchisee, What better way to have it than on Blu-Ray and Digital and have the statue. Can't wait for the 3-D release.
B003KVKQB4|5.0|This is a very important perspective on the ways disasters like Katrina are exploited for a profit. Naomi Klein has produced a carefully researched work.  In addition to extensive footnotes at the back of the book, original sources can be read online.  It is hard to argue with the facts she presents whether you agree with her conclusions or not. Hurricane Sandy is an example of the kind of disaster she is talking about. [[ASIN:1846140285 The Shock Doctrine]]
030758836X|2.0|80% of the book was great. It is the last 20% that ruined it for me. The actions of the main character, Nick, at the end were so non characteristic of him, that it left me with a bad taste in my mouth. Solely because of the ending, I wouldn't recommend this book.
1449410243|3.0|Feels narrow and one-note compared to his previouse book (which was great). Cat jokes get a little thin by the end.
B001PPLKI0|3.0|Elvis' voice was made for Gospel/Christian music.  Such an annoited sound. Many of these songs easily lead you into a place of workship.<br /><br />Since tere is so many songs in this collection it is truly a deal for anyone collecting  Elvis music.  However, not every song is a hit.<br /><br />Overall this is a good buy for anyone who enjoys classic Gospel.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Dexterity but not too fast for me. Nice slice logic. Fun penguins. Who could ask for more? Soulful in a writer ly way.
B008BIN9EW|1.0|I really enjoy playing on this app, but received an update for my phone, and now i cannot open thru Amazon or from my list of apps on my phone saying it is incompatible with my device, but it would open from my shortcut. My son deleted my shortcut and now i can't play. I am very upset
0316228532|3.0|I am an avid reader, and read a variety of different genres. I do not give up on books...I read to the very end of every book, hoping the author will pull out something of value. I was interested in reading The Casual Vacancy to see what JKR had to say to an adult audience. My first thought upon finishing this book was that JKR should stick with fantasy children's books.<br /><br />What I liked about the book was that the characters were real, in that they are all flawed and I enjoyed reading about their lives from each of the main character's viewpoints. It was a new plot - dealing with small town politics, 21st Century issues, and how all the character relationships impact one another. This is not a fluffy read.<br /><br />Disappointments....from the beginning there were too many characters introduced, with viewpoints switching back & forth, and name switching (referring to characters nicknames, full names, family last names, etc. I had to keep stopping and think, \\"who is she referring to\\") It took awhile for me to wrap my head around who was who, and in the end there were only a couple of characters that I cared about. I am typically a complete sap, cheering for characters, believing in them, crying for them - but not in this book. I was saddened by the outcome of some of the characters but did not shed a tear. I found parts of the story quite predictable.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't think I would like that most of the characters I love have been killed off, and I may change my opinion if the new ones don't pan out, but as for right now, I'm loving the fresh twist! The writers are taking a BOLD new tactic and it's going to be either an Epic success or fail. I think that alone, keeps me coming back.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Its a really cool game. I love it but its only in its alpha stages 0.4. I would recomand people who like creative mode.
B008458O3S|1.0|tried running the game on android 4.2 galaxy nexus but instantly force closes. uninstalled and tried again and same problem

B001414XLQ|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this CD and no matter how many times I hear it, it never gets old! But I still don't fully understand how to load it onto cloud player so I can listen from my phone.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My daughter really wanted the computer version - but we are waiting till we by a new computer so for now it's on our kindle. She gives this version 4 stars. she had hoped to be able to connect with her sister and friend in online games but that doesn't seem to be possible.
B0098VXBIA|1.0|I wish I had my two hours back.  This movie is very stupid.  With the cast that it had, I was hoping for more.
159420411X|1.0|Easy to review this one ... just skip to the section on global warming and note that he is an (unqualified) expert and convert. No point reading the rest if this is an example of the quality of analysis.  Actually I've found this to be a great rule of thumb for quickly finding intelligent writers, ie pro GW equals sheep (you know ... of the 4 legs good, 2 legs bad variety). Saves a lot of wasted reading time. I could probably charge for this advice, but consider it a free public service.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great!!! I Loved season 1 and season 2 was just as good.  I cant wait for Downton Abbey season 3.
B0091REZMW|5.0|love it one of the better free games there is that is out thee for a android making new friends
B009KHDT0C|3.0|This movie is not great, wait for it to be on cable for free. I never watched Dark Shadows the series, so I dont know how it compares.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|Just got this yesterday and am planning on having friends over for a viewing.  LOA has always been my favorite all time movie but as high definition TVs got better and better, the old laser disks and video cassettes of this movie just didn't do it justice.  I have anxiously awaited this Blu-Ray edition for several years.  The release date kept being postponed over and over again.<br /><br />Well, it's here at last and it is STUNNING, incredibly magnificent.  I took a sneak peek at the opening scenes cause I couldn't wait to see how it turned out.  It just totally blows you away with the clarity of the image on a big screen.  I have a 1080p Panasonic projector, a 10' diagonal Stewart screen and 7.1 digital sound system and this Blu-Ray version shows off all this \\"stuff\\" better than anything I've seen on my system.  Listening to the soundtrack's music (Maurice Jarre) through a digital surround system was proof they put as much effort into restoring the sound track as they did the film image.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray version of LoA will take your breath away.  It's hard to believe that in today's world of digitized and computer generated scenery, that all the amazing sweeping panoramic desert scenes were filmed on location.  If you love this movie, buy the Blu-Ray, PERIOD.
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|Thanks to the magic of Kindle, I'm catching up on TV shows I've heard about for years but never had time to watch. This show is amazing! The writing, the acting, the setting... The education of Walter White continues. The second to last episode was so powerful (I was watching in bed) My mouth was open, tears streamed down my face, I had to GET OUT OF BED, put my clothes on and walk around the block. This is the best multi-layered work I've seen from TV in a long time.<br />  Youtubed Bryan Cranston's back to back emmy wins, all incredibly well deserved, and now Aaron Paul has his as well.
0380820498|5.0|Every book written by Peter Robinson, I've enjoyed and this one is no exception! A fine cast of characters, smart realistic dialogue and realistic situations. You can't go wrong with this author and his series of Inspector Banks stories.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works well on kindle fire, different play levels. Annoying ads can be skipped- sometimes. overall, not bad for a free game!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this story to others!<br /><br />I really enjoyed the letter format in this story, however, there were a lot of character's to keep track of and it took me at least half way through the book to be able to easily identify with which character I was reading from but once I was able to remember which character was which, it began to get easier to understand! It was also difficult to keep up with the timing of the story and where they were in time!<br /><br />I did feel like the story did drag on throughout some parts, but all in all, the story was pretty sweet. I did also feel like the story drastically ended after so much detail with everything else, so the ending did slightly disappoint me and left me hanging.<br /><br />It was quite interesting to read the story of Guernsey and the Occupation and was quite easy to fall in love with some of the characters!<br /><br />It took me longer than I would have liked to finish this story, however, I kept finding myself wanting to keep reading to find out where the story was going. That was the one thing I did like about this story, was that you could not guess what the ending was going to be about until, BAM!! the story was over!<br /><br />This is a book that I never would have picked up if it wouldn't have been for a book club, but now that I am finished, I can hold my head high while adding it to my list of read books!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much - I was MIA until I finished it!  I was excited when I woke up in the middle of the night so that I could read a few chapters.  I wouldn't leave my house without my Kindle - so that I could read anytime I had a chance.  It was a wild ride with twists and turns that I never expected.  I am in awe (and a little frightened) by the authors' imagination - and would be a little worried if I were her husband!!  The intricate plots were so carefully concocted - so dark and devious, they were intoxicating.  It was good that I didn't fall in love with ANY of the characters, so that I could just go for the ride and not worry about who won out in the end.  I highly recommend this book!
B00A0NOF7G|4.0|I picked up Killer Cupcakes as a kindle freebie and like most they typically sit on my TBR list forever last night before bed I figured I'd read a short mystery before I jump into my next big book. Lexy Baker is living with her dog Sprinkles in her grandmothers how now that she's moved into a assisted living place. Everything is great for Lexy she has her dream business a bakery, she can eat anything she wants without gaining a ounce and she loves shoes. What more could a girl ask for?<br /><br />When Sprinkles ducks though the fence between the neighbor Lexy has no choice but to chase after her even if it's in her pj's only to find her using the neighbors flowerbed as bathroom. Thankfully Lexy is prepared but she's not prepared for the neighbor to catch her in the act of picking up poo, worse she finds him attractive.<br /><br />The next day Lexy is shocked to learn that her ex-boyfriend whom she's not seen in over two years is dead, because of eating her cake tops. Lexy is at the top of the suspects list with the help of her neighbor who happens to be a cop, her grandma's friends at the home just maybe she can find the real killer.<br /><br />Killer Cupcakes is a fun entertaining mystery, though short it doesn't lack in story-line  I almost stayed up super late reading but opted for a few pages before I decided to finish it off first thing this morning. Killer Cupcakes is a fast paced story the keeps you drawn in till the last page so it's easy to lose yourself however it's only 89 pages which for some like me is a good thing. I love the characters Lexy is great plus she has her grandmother who is in her own little ladies mystery group and who doesn't love a cute cop. I kind of want a little yappy dog named Sprinkles now at least that's what I told my hubby this morning he just ignored me since our next dog is going to be a big malamute maybe she will be Sprinkles. The other thing I liked is that the author gives us a recipe for Lexy's cake tops which I plan to try the next time I make they sounds yummy plus I want to know what all the fuss about them is.y the next time I make they sounds yummy plus I want to know what all the fuss about them is.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I began using this program in a grad class, but have really found it useful for my dissertation as I have done my lit review.
B0086700CM|5.0|when I first got this game I played it once but finally I found myself playing it nonstop .I would reomend this game to any one who just wants a fun additing game.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Really enjoyed reliving some of the things we all went through when we were mis-fits in high school.  It was so real and should be required reading.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it is fun and a challenge it tests your skills there are so many fun levels to do and explore
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Great movie!<br />Can't wait to see the next avengers movie ^^<br />Wonder who will be in it other than thanos ?<br />Anyway this movie doesn't disappoint. Has alot of action and is very well done. It wasn't exactly large scale war,but, still a great movie with a lot of eye candy for hi def owners.
B007THA4FI|3.0|No doubt this is a very well written book. We all know Rowling is an great writer but I really didn't like this book at all. I gave it 3 stars only because it was well written, the subject was too depressing for me. Left me feeling disturbed for days.
B00006I53S|4.0|A nice find and a great lense for those special ocasions when you need bigger light gathering lense. I use this mostly for evening or sun rise shots. Or night shots on long exposure.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Been a Beatles fan since they started. Was completely satisfied with purchase. Complete history from their very beginnings. Great nostalgia.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I first got the original Cross Me as an Amazon free app of the day and was instantly hooked. I hadn't heard of nonograms prior to playing it, but they are the kind of puzzle game that I think works best on a smartphone: something you can spend hours solving, but that you can easily leave when needed and return to later.The interface is ideal, allowing you to zoom in and out easily.<br />As I neared the end of the puzzles on Cross Me at that time, I knew had to get Cross Me Color. It's one of the few games I happily purchased at full price. I've been especially happy with the frequency of updates that add new puzzles. Quite often, I'll have just finished solving all the puzzles, only to get a new update less than a week later, pulling me back in.
B001W63DY6|5.0|What can anyone say about Streisand. Her unique voice and talent as only Barbra can sing is always a treat.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|Very disappointed! People on the other end of phone calls complained they could not understand me. It was also difficult to turn volume \\"off\\" with the plastic button on the case. Definitely did not live up to expectations.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|This collection of stellar performances is just too good to miss out on. Every song is a gem. Love it.
B009GYSQV6|5.0|Beautiful, haunting, catchy. Crystal Castles does it again with a very good release. Favorite tracks include Sad Eyes (fastest song on album), Kerosene (eerily awesome), and Child I Will Hurt You (the Tell Me What to Swallow of the new songs). Oh, and if you haven't seen them live, run (don't walk) to the nearest venue they're playing. You won't be disappointed.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Season 4 has surpassed my expectations. I knew this cast would deliver as well as the writers, but this season has been better than even I could imagine. I look forward to each week, and find myself a bit upset when there isn't an episode to be watched. I'm a re-watcher & have likely re-watched each episode 3 times. Even then, I still find hidden comments or gestures missed the first time. The storyline is great and evvolving with the characters which in my opinion, is what makes it great. I look forward to the rest of what season 4 has to offer!
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was very well written, and it had quite a surprise twist in the middle that I did not see coming. I did find it very disturbing though, i must say.  It left me feeling kinda sick.  If you are looking for an uplifting read, then this is not the book for you.
B009AMANBA|5.0|At The Top of the Game!<br />Magnicient! A new and maybe a far more real view of history, of heroes.<br />A depth in so many details.<br />Kindness and humor and immense savvy- in the story- the writing and in its people.<br />Will watch again and will think of images often.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer's  \\"Politically Incorrect Guide\\" yields a compelling warning of things yet to come.<br /><br />Robert Spencer's \\"Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam and the Crusades\\" caroms through the centuries and ricochet's through the geo-political maze of Islam's History, in a well developed saga of how we have arrived at the Twenty-First Century nature of (the lesser) Islamic Jihad.<br /><br />The problem in the \\"West\\", and particularly in the United States, has become the official, and categorical denial of, the very existence of (the lesser) Islamic Jihad.  The greater Jihad of Islam is \\"the personal spiritual warfare against the lower-self\\" in practicing the tenets of Islam.  The lesser Jihad is Islam's doctrine \\"to wage war against non-Muslims\\", wherever they are found on the earth, until the entire world is subsumed by the dictates of the Prophet Muhammad.<br /><br />On 11, September 1683 CE, the Ottoman Turk's conquest of Eastern Europe was halted at the Second Siege of Vienna; a mere 329 years ago.  Spencer examines the prospect of Islam having continued its conquest across the entire continent, and, closes with the problematic facing us today.<br />How can we assume that Islamic Fundamentalist (lesser) Jihad will somehow cease to threaten further conquest in this generation, ...or in the next twenty generations, when it has been continuously prosecuted over the past thirteen centuries?<br /><br />If we continue to characterize mass murder in the name of Jihad as \\"workplace violence\\", or professionally executed terrorist para-military attacks as \\"incidental results of public protests\\",we have not reckoned as to how, and why, Spencer's measured warnings are strategically essential.  The author concludes with specific advisements for moving forward and maintaining the peace.<br /><br />The book is well supported by Bibliographical End-Notes and includes a comprehensive Index.
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Never stops to acknowledge the high farce it could have been. Instead it feels like it is taking itself far too seriously and quickly descends into the drek of overused vampire tropes, offering nothing original or even vaguely entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|[[ASIN:B00A65GMM4 Say The Word [HD]]]Let's be honest, there's not a whole lot of television that is worth our money nowadays. The reason for that is because we keep paying for garbage television through our cable subscribers. I'd rather cancel my cable subscription and pay for each and every Walking Dead episode, because I don't want to pay for the garbage such as MTVs Jersey shore or TLCs Honey Boo Boo. Walking Dead keeps you on the edge of your seat, whilst exploring some of the darkest areas of the human psyche. Great casting, though I'm sad to see one of my favorite characters die this season. I'm not going to spoil it for you by telling you who it is. You'll just have to watch!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I did finish it.  It did turn me on a bit.  But, it was mostly dumb.  I am not planning to read the other ones.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|Great Movie with a twist ending. I watched it three times on TV and had to have it for my DVD collection. Reminded me of an Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
B009SSGBOE|1.0|In high school I was a huge fan of the Dan.  But I saw this coming with the advent of Royal Scam.<br /><br />I dont mind artists evolving, growing or maturing. But to be honest, Donald hasnt written a new tune in 30 years.  He keeps writing the same song over and over and over again.  He is akin to new age music for funksters.<br /><br />Listen to this enough and all of the songs begin to blur and become very beige.<br /><br />He has thrown out his gold teeth, Rikki has lost his number, hoping he wont ever do it again, they arent playing this in my old school and definitely dont buy this for your family or friends on black friday<br /><br />Sign me,<br /><br />Reelin in the years
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Action Packed, kept you wondering what was next.I'm not one for violence so the way it was handled I felt was good. My only problem the Hulk took to long to appear.
B001NAZPYM|5.0|I have never been a huge fan of the Who. In my book they are miles ahead of the Stones and Kinks and miles behind the Beatles and Zeppelin.  Most of their albums seem terribly uneven to me.  I really love a few songs, a couple I can tolerate and a few I just plain skip.<br /><br />Not this album.<br /><br />It grabs you and holds you from the opening notes of Baba to the very end of Wont get fooled again.  Not a weak moment in the whole lot.<br /><br />The Who never before, even with the accomplishment of Tommy; nor ever after, even with Quadrophenia would approach the same pinnacle of artistry.<br /><br />I cant add any more than others have already raved about this record. Plain and simple anyone with an appreciation for rock music should have this in their collection and in heavy rotation.<br /><br />P.S.  My original review follows but was declined by Amazon:  \\"It is my understanding that reviews must contain at least twenty words about the product.  Here is my opinion: Masterpiece\\"<br /><br />Enjoy real loud
B001R6AW18|5.0|An extraordinary achievement for 1933 -- I voted for it in the first AFI canvas of members for &#34;greatest American film&#34; of all time (back in the 1970s). Cooper and Schoedsack totally eclipsed what seemed possible for film craftsmanship at the time. The script is tighter than in either of the remakes (both of which admittedly have their moments), the beauty and the beast story is told with simplicity and heartbreaking poignancy. Love Fay Wray. Folks will say, &#34;Oh the F/X are so . . . 1930s.&#34; But all that really means is that enjoying them is like savoring a fine old wine. And . . . No King Kong: No Ray Harryhausen
B001O7SMRG|5.0|Okay heres the deal... lets pretend you have just returned with Gilligan, Ginger, The Skipper and MaryAnn. That would be the only reason you are unfamiliar with this album.<br /><br />But wow! This still sounds fresh and relevant 40 plus years later.  Stellar from top to bottom. Combines the best of pop, folk, rock, pyschedelia into a package that has few rivals.  I would say its darn near perfect...except for Marakesh Express.  For whatever reason it seems to throw an odd wrinkle into the flow of this masterpiece for me. But that said, the humanity of it makes it all the more charming and endearing.<br /><br />If you dont have this don't waste another minute. Heck, you been gone 40 years, get Deja vu and 4 way street while you're at it.  Play them in order without a break.<br /><br />It will be the best three hour cruise you have ever been on.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|notes are accessable regardless of OS or device. which is great, web, fire, phone or windows os. would get 5 stars but the web version can get flakey sometimes. Recomend adding notes via the fire, or windows program(available for Mac too). Also only premium version has a go back button incase you need to go back to previous version of your note. Premium version is subscription based, which I'm not a fan of. But in all a great note taking program.
B0012QK8G2|5.0|Thin Lizzy is one of the most underrated hard rock bands in history.  Incredibly talented, amazingly influential (cited by everybody and their brother as an influence including Metallica)and even better live than in the studio, TL was never given its due.  Live and Dangerous is in my top 5 live albums of all time.  Lynott exudes charisma as a frontman. Gorham and Robertson smoke and are second only to Wishbone Ash in dual guitar wizardry. Jailbreak is volcanic, the transition of Cowboy song/Boys are back in town will give you chills and Dancing in the Moonlight will make you want to do just that.<br /><br />This album kills.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I didn't start truly exploring Muse until halfway between Black Holes & Revelations and The Resistance. I was also someone who just listened to Knights of Cydonia and Assassin, purely for the enjoyment of fast speeds and quick beats. But then I started to regress to Muse before BH&R wanting to know more about this band.<br /><br />Hysteria was the first track that caught my ears. It was firstly a fascination of the bass line, and then, truly discovering the lyrics. I guess this song is what made we want to sit down and listen to this album as a whole.<br /><br />I sit down and listen to the first song of the album, Apocalypse Please (Intro is just an introduction to the album, not a song). To my disliking I hear that it is a slow piece, I move my mouse to skip the song, but find myself unable to click to do so. I begin to think, is there more to Muse than just fast paced music, or even rock as a whole? I guess you can say Muse is the reason why I can enjoy slow music now, they showed me it doesn't need to be fast all the time.<br /><br />I continue to progress through the album, from the beautiful orchestration supporting Blackout to the calm, driving piano build-up of Ruled by Secrecy. There is not a single song on this album I can say I'm bothered by or can't enjoy. Yes, the fast pieces on here were the first songs I listened and loved, but it was Hysteria that made me try the album as a whole.<br /><br />Another thing, explore the B-tracks for this album, it's a shame they couldn't be on it for its direct release.<br /><br />And finally, why are there so many butthurt Radiohead fans here reviewing? Just because I think a Radiohead song and a Muse song sound alike doesn't mean I get all pissed and go write a bad review for a Radiohead album. If you don't like it then don't listen, no one is forcing you to listen to Muse.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I just watched Prometheus on 3D. I did not see it in the theatres.  All the positive reviews are completely accurate and I appreciate the reviews I read prior to my purchase.  This film is beautiful in 3D.  There's really nothing that \\"pops\\" out at the viewers.  Rather, the landscapes, characters and actions appear so REAL and VIVID as if you're right on the movie set. I am not a rabid fan of the Alien series, just a fan of sci-fi. So I don't feel qualified to comment about how this movie rates with respect to other Ridley Scott flicks (although nothing beats Blade Runner). I am extremely happy to have made the purchase.
B000YHE4AG|5.0|Good for all ages.<br />Chistmas is the time of year many families and friends gather, enjoying Christmas type movies and this movie will not disappoint..it adds to the fun and laughter you, loved ones, and friends will share this season!<br />PS.don't forget to add popcorn or Christmas coookies!
B009DJB8I2|2.0|I purchased this because a friend got a TF2 code for a special prize in the game. I just got my copy yesterday and I only got an invite to DOTA2. I guess it's cool if you're a fan of Portal but I really wanted the TF2 item.

B009Q6ADG0|5.0|THE MAIN TITLE THEME SKYFALL BY ADELE:  This is the best JAMES BOND main title theme sung in a long time and it runs close to 5 minutes. Written and sung ay ADELE-her amazing voice equals Shirley Bassey in strength. This sounds the way a James Bond movie theme should sound and what BOND fans expect to hear. ADELE definitely pulls it off with not only singing it but writing it. I hope to hear more of  her singing Bond title themes in the future.  This is the first time I've ever heard ADELE sing. It takes alot of voice with grace, melody, and strength for me to even be wowed by an artist I've never heard of before. This is just the single for the main title movie of SKYFALL--You better get it because it is not-repeat it is not on the cd soundtrack movie score by Thomas Newman. After hearing ADELE sing this theme, and I love it and her voice, it has inspired me to look into purchasing ADELE's regular music cd's with looking forward to pleasure. Thankyou ADELE !
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|My 10 year old loved this movie and I was surprised at how much I liked it too.  The story was great with a bit of a sad part close to the end there but it had just the right dab of pulling at the heart strings.  Some of the humor and father and son moments were great!  I think this one will be a classic.  I like to rent titles before I buy them and after my families reaction it's a \\"must\\" own.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|I'am a big-big-big  JAMES BOND Fan. I will be seeing this movie today, so I don't know anything about this new film. Over all the years of Bond I've collected many Bond special items. All the music soundtrack scores on vinyl and cd released I have purchased. I always look forward to a new main title theme and score along with seeing the film. This time I have this new SKYFALL score before even seeing the film. Anyway, this is a long cd that runs close to the 80 minutes limit.It is supposed to have all background tunes from the film-this is good to be complete: this part is a plus. One big downfall of this CD is that like the cd score of CASINO ROYALE: the main title vocal theme by ADELE is not-repeat not on this instrumental score and it will say so in small print on the back of the disc.It would not even fit with Tom Newman's music because ADELE's vocal runs almost 5 minutes which there is no time left for it on disc space-you must buy the ADELE single separately with this to get the whole score. Newman's score is very good with many different sounds,refreshing the Bond character. JOHN BARRY will always be my favorite Bond score composer. Bond's background music has needed to be refreshed in my opinion and THOMAS NEWMAN I consider to be very good to do this.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Joss Whedon did it again! \\"The Avengers\\" has the perfect mix of superheroes, villains and city-leveling action scenes. Each superhero has well-developed characteristics unique to themselves. Throughout the movie you see those characteristics drive them apart only to bring them back together in the end to create an incredibly deadly force.<br /> Under the direction of Nick Fury, played by Samuel L. Jackson, Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, the Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow must band together to retrieve the tesseract from other-worlder, and brother of Thor, Loki. The introduction of the movie shows Loki taking the tesseract from the United States government. The tesseract is a blue cube of raw energy, highly valuable and dangerous in the wrong hands because it can also provide a portal to outer space. Midway through the movie we learn the real, not altogether surprising, purpose of why the government was actually studying the tesseract in depth.<br /> This movie portrays Loki's rebellion against Thor and his supposed rise to power. He teams up with an alien species, the Chitauri, who claim to help him have Earths inhabitants bowing down to him in exchange for the tesseract. This is his way of getting back at Thor; he believes that he should have been king of Asgard, not Thor. While Loki is preparing to open a portal using the tesseract to bring his alien army to bring mass chaos and destruction to Earth, the Avengers are bickering with each other. With a little kick from Nick Fury, the Avengers realized that they have to work as a team to defeat Loki once and for all. Of course, there is also the little fact that the U.S. government, who have little faith in the Avengers, decide that it would be better to just lose part of New York than to have Loki's army fight the Avengers, so they send a nuclear bomb.<br /> Overall, \\"The Avengers\\" is a prime example of quality cinematic engineering with its stimulating feeling of foreboding from the start of the movie leading upto the battle of epic proportions everyone is waiting for. The writers, geniuses that they are, used comical witty banter between the superheroes to give a lighter note to the dark theme without losing sight of the movies purpose.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I don't understand why people are fooled by this book. The story is nothing more than poor trickery. The stories are OK, but the connection between them is poor and best and almost silly at times. The language used is well done, but the some of it becomes so hard to understand it makes it worthless... All in all don't listen to the hype...
B003O86FMW|4.0|This is a very good book in fact its my favourite one out of the series!I just have always loved Harry Potter even though it seems old to some people!

B008G8SFGO|5.0|At his point you are lucky to get a new kiss cd. So why all the whining from the one star people? These are people who can't get a grip on the fact that this band is still making music and it's decent stuff. They want ONLY their type of kiss from the seventies and if it's not that exactly they WHINE. So ignore the one star reviews as they are just fairweather fans imo. Kiss should be THANKED for having the balls to make another cd for us. Knowing full well that at this stage of the game they are lucky just to still be around. 38 years into their career they deliver a good hard rock melodic metal cd and that's good enough for me. It's where kiss is at today and they made a solid well done hard rock cd. That's enough for me. Thank you kiss for giving me some more rockers to enjoy. i have the more expensive japan edition by the way with it's bonus track on it. It sounds better than a standard cd too, the bonus track is a live version of 'king of the nighttime world\\". The sound of this one though is rather harder than the past. It's kiss and it's hard kiss. I like sonic boom better and that type of production. So complaints about production tastes are valid. But the disc still kicks butt.

0385344333|5.0|It took me a while to get this book because of the bad reviews.  I love this book and it is an exciting page turner like the other books about Reacher.  I just plain do not understand how someone could give it a bad review.  It's top quality and well written.
0425263908|5.0|wow! this book was so hot!! had me squirming in my seat! every time Gideon and Eva were together sparks flew every which way. The library scene was just beyond hot! It was so forbidden and the fact that there was someone else in the room.....YUM!<br /><br />From the moment Gideon and Eva meet they cant get enough of each other. Gideon is not the relationship type of guy but with Eva he wants more. But both he and Eva have a lot that was broken in their pasts
B004G6TD4S|5.0|This is probably the 2d best album, Tarkus being the 1st. If you are an ELP fan and only have 'The Best Of', you are missing out on some great organ work by Emerson.
0307949486|4.0|Upon finishing the novel, I find the original Swedish title, Men Who Hate Women, infinitely more fitting.<br /><br />This book took a little while to hook me, but I think that is a failure on my part as a reader rather than a failure on Stieg Larsson's part as a writer. I was trying to read too fast, and I wasn't taking the time to really let the material sink in. All the financial journalism jargon at the beginning caused this, as that subject is one that goes completely over my head...it's just not something I am particularly interested in, never mind that it was in regard to a foreign currency and economy.<br />A good mystery book is one where I don't guess the killer or motive.<br /><br />A great mystery book is one where I do guess the killer, but it fails to ruin my enjoyment of said book because the rest of the story, characters, and reasoning for such a tragedy are so juicy and good that I don't care.
0446580848|5.0|This guy is the most sarcastic, egotistical, megalomaniac I've ever had the pleasure to read. John Corey's quick wit and sarcastic sense of humor make this DEFINITELY NOT a dull book. Don't read it before you read the earlier Corey forays into 'law enforcement'.
0307949508|5.0|More fully realized than Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. I enjoyed having Lisbeth as the main character, she seems a more interesting character. It was a better read than the first one, however, the ending felt labored and artificial - the tone of the climax was different somehow than the rest of the book. I'm
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Classic Grisham.... drew me in until I was so engossed in the story that I lost all track of time and my surroundings. I had to get to the end, then was sorry when it was finished. He always leaves me wanting more.
0517548232|3.0|I am not a native speaker but have no problem understanding the popular books on economy. Not this one. I am still struggling with the style so I cannot fully judge the content of it yet.<br /><br />In my opinion, an author that writes for general public (that is for whom the book was intended, I assume) should try to simpify the writing style.<br /><br />And for that reason I gave it 3 stars.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|No unrealistic expectations, just a simple sharpening option that travels well. The tapered stem seems to be the most useful, as the slots (steel/ceramic?) are at a fixed angle. The lanyard hole allows a brightly colored piece of cord to be tie through for quick location. (sharpener is black and small) Good piece for someone with little sharpening experience.
B007PJFIU6|5.0|I love this game for my family, with 9, 11, and 13 year old kids to play together! Mom and Dad enjoy seeing the creative and intriguing ideas each kid comes up with. High replay value with young and old alike! Great party game that is simple to learn. We only wish we had more expansions, and possibly the game board for more players that comes with Odyssey.  Highly recommend!
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This movie didn't disappoint.  I am a sucker for Jonah Hill and his genre of comedy.  Channing fits comfortably with Jonah in this comedy.
B009FBX5M0|4.0|Contrary to a popular rumor, Thomas Newman's score for the latest, and the 50th Anniversary edition of the James Bond franchise, Sam Mendes' \\"Skyfall,\\" is hardly the worst of the enormous musical collection; that dubious achievement still belongs to Eric Serra and \\"Goldeneye\\" (to be followed by the late Marvin Hamlisch, \\"The Spy Who Loved Me,\\" Bill Conti, \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" and George Martin, \\"Live and Let Die\\").  This does not include commentary on theme songs (a great song doth not a great score make), although the last few have been pretty unremarkable Adele's \\"Skyfall,\\" which does not appear on this soundtrack album, comes closer to a true Bond anthem than we have had in quite some time (The best?  \\"Goldfinger,\\" \\"Live and Let Die,\\" \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" \\"Nobody Does it Better,\\" \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\"  \\"We Have All the Time in the World,\\" and \\"Diamonds Are Forever\\").  To be honest Newman's effort is not up there with John Barry's best (\\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service,\\" \\"Goldfinger,\\" \\"You Only Live Twice,\\" \\"Diamonds Are Forever,\\" \\"From Russia With Love,\\" and \\"Thunderball\\"), but it is a good deal better than \\"Dr. No\\" and some of the work of David Arnold.  It is actually surprisingly good as an album, and works very well with what is on the screen (the real test).  And Barry is not with us anymore, so here we are.  There is no lack of kinetic energy here, and Newman knows when to tone things down for reflective, if not romantic, moments (something he is very well known for and with good reason).  He blends a subtle yet sinister main theme throughout and teases with limited use of the James Bond theme just enough to make sure we know this is a Bond epic except for a couple of key moments (\\"Breadcrumbs\\" among them) when it comes through with certitude. Many of us had our doubts about the choice of Newman, but in the end this is a good effort for a film that is certainly a solid production in almost every way with some great touches at the end.  The fundamental problem in scoring a Bond film is simply that Barry was so damnably good and a hard act to follow by even good composers such as Arnold (\\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\") and now Newman (\\"The Horse Whisperer\\").  The recent tendency to leave the theme song off the soundtrack album is too bad but understood given the complications of modern musical contracts and copyright law, and sadly with some of them there is no great loss anyway. The best news is of course that Bond is back in action, and will return. Solid production values and adequate packaging (should have been better for a 50th Anniversary) by Sony.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised!  The last couple of Grisham's have not been my favorites, but this one it seems he is back to his old self...a GREAT READ!

B005IQZB14|4.0|Very engaging read.  I could not put it down. The reader can feel the author's experience - it felt like you were on the PCT with her.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|Not sure what all the negative hoopla is about but my set sounds great!! No fuzzy sounds. No off-centered holes. No scratches or scuff marks. Just some great music all gathered together in one set. Me thinks though dost protest too much (I know that is a paraphrase). I wish more people would just enjoy the records and the music instead of trying to analyze and find every minuscule fault with the set. People were even complaining about it before it was released. What can be said about this set that has not already been said about the Beatles for the last 50 years? It's the Beatles it's vinyl and it's Rock and Roll. Play these records like they are meant to be played. By the way these recordings sound a lot better than the CD set. I have both and they both serve their purpose but so far I am loving the vinyl. My only complaint was the packaging for shipping was terrrible. They just threw it in a large box with one small piece of plastic padding. I ordered mine overnight shipping so it did not have time to get too jostled around. Shame on you Amazon!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I would recommend this book to. All my friends.  Victoria breaks your heart throughout the book. Her flaws make her a very endearing character.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Well, I just finished watching Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter. I thought by the title ,this movie was going to be rediculous. Not having much faith in what  movie critics have to say,I happen stumble on to reviews by movie goers and to my suprise the comments for the most part very positive. So, I checked it out and I must say I really enjoyed it. The story was interesting, the action sequences were pure eye candy , and the acting was better than most movies I have seen all year. If you are looking for a history, forget it, but if your taste is for something different and fun ,check this one out and join the fan club.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|A wonderful movie even after seeing it four or five times.  I get something new from the movie each time I watch it.  [[ASIN:B008XBCJ34 Avatar (Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray/ DVD Combo Pack)]]

030759565X|5.0|All I can say is: Highly recommended!!!<br /><br />I love Deb's blog and I love her cookbook as well. I've been using her blog to craft amazing dinners and desserts for several years now. Her recipes have given me a reputation for being a great cook with my family and friends, and even among some total strangers. Whether you like to cook/bake or not, Deb's work will provide both inspiration and step-by-step instructions. Hooray for Smitten Kitchen!
B005M2A4D4|5.0|I will never get tired of Doctor Who great series.  I don't watch a lot of sci fi but this is great.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|My good friend told me I should see this movie and began throwing quotes out at work-mostly about Wisconsin.  I am not a romanyltic comedy guy. This turned out not only to be the best RC I've seen but a top Holiday movie as well. It has a top notch cast led by Hugh Grant and some touching if predictable scenes. I purchased the movie after a prior rental I want it in my library for available viewing..
B0098VXE50|4.0|This item was a gift and I was very much pleased with the ease and speed to which ordering this was.  I was also pleased with the care it was shipped and the actual DVD itself.  We both enjoyed the move as we are sci-fi/adventure seekers.  Special effects were great!
0756407125|5.0|Plenty of reviews, so I will keep this brief.  The cons first:  Too much filler...at one point I expected a chapter with Kvothe knitting a sweater...a lot of Kvothe doing things that did nothing to advance the plot or reveal Character.  This book has about 200 pages too many.<br /><br />That being said, a very solid character driven follow-up story that left me satisfied at the end.  Rothfuss' writing is concise, vivid, and easy to read.  The Name of the Wind is a better book but only because of the excess narrative.<br /><br />The stories side-by-side are equally good.
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Really nice relaxing music.  Totally enjoyed it.  Let Her Go is one of the best songs I've heard in awhile.
0765316994|4.0|I am a big Star Trek fan, so for me this was a fun read.  I have seem some scathing reviews but I think its good to make fun of our flaws, even TV shows.  If your looking for a page turning literary novel...this definetly is not it but a very easy read that kept a smile on my face.  I read it between two 800+ page Novels so a nice literary pallet cleanser.<br /><br />If you have watched the original Star Trek series and have an average sense of humor you will enjoy this book.  A little pricey though.

B006WQLH7G|5.0|Great product ! The anti theft tool is excellent and the protection of the entire package is second to none. My only observation is the install is not meant for the average layperson. It is a tad bit confusing to install if you have little IT experience. Otherwise I would rate this product as an excellent buy!
B008LSVL6U|5.0|WOW, this was like being right in the audience, at the concert.<br />I saw a you-tube track of one of the songs & immediately thought, I must have this Blu-Ray!<br /><br />After the usual ritual of removing the shrink wrap,and inserting the disk, and hitting the play button on my BR player, I was THERE for 2 hours.<br /><br />I was introduced to Wilson's music when listening to a Prog web radio show back when \\"Lightbulb Sun\\"  was released.<br /><br />My esteem for him grew, when I listened to his remasters of the King Crimson classics in 5.1 surround.<br /><br />Seeing and hearing him with his current lineup is just an amazing evolution of a musical master at his best.<br /><br />Wilson has absorbed Crimson/Floyd/Mahavishnu Orchestra (Adam Holzman's keys), and regurgitated a totally new, and involving Prog/Jazz fusion Mash up  that is destined to become a classic.<br />I can't wait for this band's next release!

I didn't see the DVD but the and her Mom enjoyed it a lot. Julie Andrews - what's not to like? ? ?  Glad I was able to get it for her. I can always get the \\"oldies but goodies\\" on Amazoon.

B00000E2QI|5.0|This is better than expected.  Do not listen to as background music, too powerful.  I listen often to escape the humdrum. Just sit back and enjoy.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|A beautiful collection of songs by Lana Del Rey. The album production focuses more on her vocal and song-writing strengths and avoids the few lows of Born To Die. Gone are the silly hip hop samplings and infantile expressions of love. Instead, something more mature has emerged: lyrics that speak to grown-ups, sometimes cheeky, sometimes heart-breaking, often surprising and fresh. I'll be playing this album for years to come.
0425264351|4.0|It's a good ol' page-turner, with a likable, remorseless anti-hero killing machine, a black-and-white good vs. evil world, where the good guy gets his hands dirty, the bad guys die violent, horrible deaths, and a lot of the twists are easy to figure out.<br /><br />I'd call it a good 1980's action movie type of book. I'll read more Jack Reacher, simply because it was entertaining, but don't go in expecting Steinbeck.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|installed on Galaxy s3 and doesn't load, once open feint loads it restarts itself, in a constant loop making it unplayable. They need just remove Openfient, it's an worthless amount overhead, and it would go along way to make it playable again

So I gave the zombies a shot and good thing I did because it is one of my favorite shows of all time!!!!!<br />I'm still not a fan of science fiction but the walking dead has a good enough plot and story to make it great!!!!! My fiancé is not into scary movies or any movies that are gross or bloody at all but she loves this show too!! If she can love it anyone can.<br />The only criticism I have about the first season is that it's only 6 episodes but they are all great!!<br />At least they didn't put in filler to make a normal full season.<br />If you are like me and my fiancé and don't really like science fiction or blood and guts, give this show a chance because it has a great story to make up for the blood.<br />If you are on the fence about this series then take a chance like I did and you will be very very surprised and happy you did!!!!!<br />Must see tv!!!!
0525953728|5.0|A very easy read, the author explained everything so that a layman could understand. Writing style was smooth and kept my interest. I found myself being unable to put the book down.

I would consider myself a tv series aficionado.<br />I was hooked in the first ten minutes. I love when a show has me guessing the whole way through! Revenge does! I also loved the flash forwards and flashbacks.<br />If you are looking for a twisting, turning, guessing, exciting great show, I would highly recommend this show!!!!!!<br />If you have any plans on the weekend you buy this and watch it, I would clear your calendar!

1476712042|3.0|I have read many of Sylvia Days, Laura Kaye books and tried this book.  It is ok but not what I was expecting. The story is fair but the intimate parts were nothing but immature and lacked the passion and detail. So if your looking for a erotic book similar to fifty shades or any of Laura Kaye or Sylvia Day dont bother with this one.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Even the stripping wasn't that great. It was definately a movie with no real content. Considering the actors in the movie the acting was terrible. Who do you blame? The actors? The director? The writers?  The movie production company that thought this was a movie worth producing? Just plan horrible.
B008I34XUY|5.0|Following the general accessibility of Zappa's previous [[ASIN:B0000009SG Over-Nite Sensation]],there was probably the feeling that Frank Zappa might be on the road to becoming the very thing he'd always stood against: becoming a musical sellout. Zappa might not have been all that aware of it in that fashion,since not only was he extremely busy producing and arranging one mini musical masterpiece after another for seven or eight following this album nearly nonstop that he likely was under the impression that people just weren't getting the point of his music. And if he had to razzle dazzle them with something that was radio friendly to get their attention,so be it. Than again the only person inside Frank Zappa's head was Frank Zappa. No matter how off the wall something seemed to be from him for the unaware,it always ended up making sense in a big way in hindsight. Employing the same lineup as with his previous album,FZ continued on in the same vein here as before basically.<br /><br />  The first four songs here from the somewhat surprising radio sensation \\"Don't Eat The Yellow Snow\\" through \\"Father O'Blivion\\" tells the story of a Nanook of the North type figure,in this case an Eskimo witch doctor which conceptually comes off as one of Zappa's many witty commentaries of the Age Of Aquarius era faux mysticism's and how so many people seemed so easily drawn to them. And all this full of scatological gags and brilliant progressive jazz/fusion musicianship. \\"Cosmik Debris\\" finds Zappa in a blues oriented mode and again hectoring gurus promising much and often delivering on comparatively little. \\"Excentrifugal Forz\\" and the instrumental title song really go again for that heavily groove centered jazz-funk sound. Another famous number here is the Zappa/Duke writing collaboration of \\"Uncle Remus\\",which in under three minutes manages to expose many of the denials and hypocrisies Zappa has observed about racism. The album ends with another blues oriented groove in \\"Stink Foot\\",again with another funk oriented lyric about the phoniness of etiquette.<br /><br />  From the very beginning to the very end Frank Zappa has always lyrically focused on often biting social satire that was surrounded by often incredible new fusions of the different musics presented to Zappa by the talented musicians who played with him. On this album his intelligence,wit and keen sense of social commentary all come together both musically and lyrically in a way that is even more publicly communicative than the previous recording. Although Zappa himself jested at the beginning of this album about being \\"strictly commercial\\",Zappa was one of these people of the opinion that sarcasm was the intelligent persons form of humor. Sometimes it could come off as nasty,even spiteful. From others. With Zappa? Well there always seemed to be the impression that it was necessarily personalized. But more an American exercising their right to free speech. Sometimes Zappa happily offended listeners with this approach. On albums like this he managed to get most people both laughing and jesting right along with him. And that quality,also strongly emphasized on this album with it's continual return to the 12 bar electric blues,is really bought to the forefront here.ot\\",again with another funk oriented lyric about the phoniness of etiquette.<br /><br />  From the very beginning to the very end Frank Zappa has always lyrically focused on often biting social satire that was surrounded by often incredible new fusions of the different musics presented to Zappa by the talented musicians who played with him.

B009NPKTN6|1.0|Don't even know if I should rate this movie because I couldn't even get past the first 10 minutes of the movie.  The part I saw I thought was extrememly cheesy.
B008I34ZG6|5.0|Frank Zappa stands out in my own mind as being one of those few musicians who,if he doesn't already have one,deserves a musical sub genre named after him much in the same manner as Bo Diddly. He seems to have bought all his influences together into a sound that was unpredictable,cocky,witty,explicit and often downright ingenious all at the same time. Following the breakup of the original lineup of the Mothers Of Invention in the early 70's,Zappa regrouped to record two seminal instrumental releases in utilizing the still relatively new jazz-fusion genre. The music's blend of jazz improvisation through psychedelic era rock was just about the perfect base from which Zappa to continue to perfect his art. Best part was his own musical innovations were already moving in that direction organically anyway. Retaining the talents of Ian and Rush Underwood,Don Sugarcane Harris and of course George Duke,he also bought in talents such as Jean Luc Ponty,Napoleon Murphy Brock and even Tina Turner and the Ikettes on backing vocals for this album to re-create,in new vocal and melodic ways,what he'd achieved with his previous two studio releases.<br /><br />  Starting out this set is \\"Camarillo Brillo\\",the closest thing to a standard issue California 70's boogie rock type song Frank Zappa ever did. Of course this is Frank Zappa we're talking about. Standard issue anything isn't going to be in the equation very long. Then it goes to my favorite number here,the greasy funk of \\"I'm The Slime\\",an early example of the same conceptual impulse much later expressed on [[ASIN:B00008F2SL Television the Drug of the Nation]] many years later,even down to the rapped lyrics. \\"50/50\\" comes right out at you with that exciting intersection of in the groove flamboyance of the funkier end of hard rock,and that's basically what the lyrics deal with as a character sketch as well. On the openly lustful \\"Dinah-Moe-Hum\\" it's jazz/funk/rock boogie type fusion all the way whereas \\"Zomby Woof\\" again comes at things from a more guitar oriented rockier end of fusion where Zappa himself moves up front in the musical mix.  is an alternately famous/infamous number here-a strong dynamic jazz fusion \\"Dirty Love where Zappa tells us,typically in an explicit manner of a sexual encounter involving a degree of beastiality. \\"Montana\\" ends the album on some slow and sleek bluesy funk groove.<br /><br />  In terms of both lyrics and music,whether the music be based more in jazz or rock,the key term to describe this would be as a funky album. Not only is it funky. But especially with the presence of George Duke,himself about to launch into a highly innovative solo career with Zappa producer Kerry McKnabb on the MPS label [[ASIN:B001AI1QV8 Faces in Reflection]],an album recorded around this time and more than worthwhile to pick up if your a fan of Zappa of this period,the music here is definitely based in the funk era as well. The musicians,who were of such a powerful and high quality many of them would soon become major players and innovators of their own,all dive headlong inside the groove on every one of these songs and stay right there on the one wherever Zappa's musical and lyrical conceptualizations happened to be. And even though the music often seemed very free form,it was just the charm of Zappa showing again. His music,again a good quality for funk,was so much about control and often strong perfectionism. Not to overuse a term but it definitely bought to mind the idea of controlled chaos. And this particular album,by often being the most pop song craft and melodic oriented of his 70's era releases,added to Zappa's unique take on the funk era from his perspective here.things from a more guitar oriented rockier end of fusion where Zappa himself moves up front in the musical mix.  is an alternately famous/infamous number here-a strong dynamic jazz fusion \\"Dirty Love where Zappa tells us,typically in an explicit manner of a sexual encounter involving a degree of beastiality. \\"Montana\\" ends the album on some slow and sleek bluesy funk groove.<br /><br />  In terms of both lyrics and music,whether the music be based more in jazz or rock,the key term to describe this would be as a funky album.

B003JIPJRE|5.0|Violent. Entertaining. Real. This film has all that and more, and presents a more 'real' look at batman than many of the modern movies (in my opinion goes head to head with Nolan's work). This film shows the cause and effect of becoming 'The Dark Knight', and reveals the cost of the commitment. The last few min of the movie are simply brilliant, showing no real end to Batman's heavy burden

B0009QBLA8|3.0|I am all for strange, underground, cult films, however, this was not one of my favorites. I feel as though nothing happened the whole time I watched it. I probably would never watch this film again, although it was quite humorous in certain points.

1419705849|3.0|'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' uses a cartoon format to recapitulate the authors memories going back to his mother playing classical music for him via speakers placed on her belly, as well as using a microphone attached to the speakers to tell the yet unborn about her day, followed by dad doing the same when he got home. Mother would also read to him for a half-hour before going to bed. The problem - their sleep schedules didn't coincide. Supposedly this all would enrich him and create a genius. Also, he didn't appreciate being privy to the lovey-dovey between his parents.<br /><br />After being born he found out that he wasn't an only child - quite disconcerting. His life became that of one hand-me-down after another. Continuing, we learn of issues with his younger brother, problems his parents had with his ne'er-do-well uncle. Then its off toe school, and eventually pimples, data, slow-dancing.
B007CGLRWA|5.0|Adrian Brody performs another spectacular lead role that turns the eye on the public school system and shows the complete breakdown of parents missing from their childrens lives and placing the responsibility on the teacher to raise their children for them. This movie doesn't pull any punches and shows kids at their worst and the fleeting hold on sanity the teachers have. There really aren't any feel good moments to be had and it shocks you into thought. I highly enjoyed it but be prepared for the melancholy of processing everything that happens as the movie is very graphic.
B004DARF6A|4.0|Enjoyed this Charlie Chaplin classic depicting factory speedups characteristic of those times, as well as unemployment and unionization efforts. Management was always out for another way to squeeze more work out of employees (speeding up the line, constant surveillance, trying out a feeding machine so that staff wouldn't need a lunch break). Chaplin ends up with a nervous breakdown, unable to stop performing the repetitive motions of his job even when not on the line. Upon discharge, he's jailed after being mistaken for a strike leader (Communist), gets a recommendation from the Sheriff for breaking up a takeover of the jail, loses a few more jobs via bumbling, and meets a sweet young thing orphaned during the shooting during a melee.

B009369Z8A|4.0|LAWLESS is inspired by the essentially true and fascinating adventures of the legendary, seemingly \\"indestructible,\\" Bondurant Brothers, bootleggers in Prohibition-era Virginia, who went to war against corrupt politicians and, in doing so, became heroes to their neighbors.<br /><br />Shia LeBeouf, Tom Hardy and Jason Clarke play the backwoods siblings.  They only want to make an \\"honest\\" living, selling their moonshine at a fair price to people in their community, but when a crooked special deputy (Guy Pearce) demands a large cut of their action, the brothers refuse and that leads to violence, torture and murder.<br /><br />Adapted for the screen by composer Nick Cave from a novel (based on fact) by Matt Bondurant, grandson of the character played in the film by LeBeouf, LAWLESS features a cast of intriguing, multi-dimensional characters, portrayed by some of the most talented actors in films today.  Jessica Chastain, as an emotionally damaged woman from Chicago who comes to work for the brothers, Mia Wasikowska, as a Mennonite girl courted by LeBeouf, and Gary Oldman, playing a big city gangster on the run, are also memorable in their roles<br /><br />Director John Hillcoat and his team have flawlessly re-created backwoods Virginia of the early 1930s.  His action sequences are well staged and riveting.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film does have several slow spots, caused by the fact that the screenplay lacks focus.  Too much time is spent on two romantic subplots (i.e. LeBeouf/Wasikowska, Hardy/Chastain), which are, in themselves, touching, but these sequences distract from the primary storyline, the conflict between the brothers and Pearce's character.  LeBeouf serves as the narrator of the movie and has top billing, yet the filmmakers never make clear whether this is his story or Hardy's.<br /><br />Anchor Bay Entertainment has issued LAWLESS in a 3-disc (Blu-Ray/DVD/Digital) combo pack.  Extras include audio commentary by director Hillcoat and author Matt Bondurant, deleted scenes, a music video and several featurettes that discuss the real brothers and the making of the film.<br /><br />©Michael B.

0307279189|5.0|For decades I thought Bruce Springsteen said all there was to say about being \\"Born to Run.\\" What a delight to find out the Boss didn't have the final word! That honor goes to Chris McDougall's book Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, Superathletes, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen. The title delivers all it suggests and more, much more. McDougall provides fascinating vignettes about Mexico's mysterious running people, the Tarahumara, amazing and eccentric runners from around the globe, and the most grueling race you can imagine. Using the theme of running, this books taps into the human spirit, and our natural inclination to run. You don't need to be an ultra-runner to love this book. All you have to do is read it.

I just completed 5 straight days, I have more energy and I'm ready to keep going. What is really interesting is I am less fatigued after my workout, but I am more sore then my prior routine.

B003VPWXRO|2.0|This book was so horribly hard to get through because as others stated it has very little substance in it at all. The whole book is about what she ate and what she did for exercise. Nothing much really about her family etc.. what happened to her dad for instance? Nothing really about how she got through it just a lot of whining and I hate myself, I am fat over and over. She repeats herself a LOT and at the end all you get is a few paragraphs that have any substance to them at all.  Much better books to read on this topic out there.
B0068THAGY|5.0|Totally digging this movie.<br /><br />I don't know what the reason is, but whenever a story revolves around kids placed into adult situations, the movie is always so much better than watching adults in those same situations.<br /><br />I didn't have high expectations for this movie, but it has it all: love, loss, friendship, military (and military corruption), parent/child relationships (most dysfunctional), it's a blast from the past (set in the late 1970s), and, yes folks, even an alien.  I typically hate alien movies because they are usually overdone, overacted, and overreaching, but this movie just blends so many things seamlessly.

B0077ATSSQ|4.0|Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close is a memorable film that moved me greatly. On the surface the story uses the September 11th, 2001 terrorist attacks to advance the story but the film is much more about coping with the loss of a loved one; and it's all beautifully done. The acting was incredibly good; I was amazed at how brilliantly young Thomas Horn essentially carries the entire movie being supported by some of the best actors today--Tom Hanks, Sandra Bullock, Max von Sydow, Zoe Caldwell, Viola Davis, Jeffrey Wright and others! The cinematography and choreography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film quite a bit.<br /><br />We first see how Thomas Schell, a jeweler (Tom Hanks) loves to play with his son Oskar (Thomas Horn), a troubled kid who might have Asperger's Syndrome (at one point Oskar says his test results for Asperger's were inconclusive). Thomas plays with Oskar so that Oskar can build self-confidence and get over his fears which are many--including swing sets! In particular, Oskar likes to go on scavenger hunts that his father Thomas sets up for him; there's even one scavenger hunt to find the fictional sixth borough of New York City that turns out to be extremely meaningful. Tragically, Thomas is killed on September 11th in the attacks on The World Trade Center. This leaves vulnerable young Oskar tormented and his mother Linda (Sandra Bullock) doesn't know what to do to make her son happy again as she herself looks for ways to cope with life without her husband.<br /><br />One year later, Oskar goes through his father's closet and accidentally breaks a blue vase; inside the vase is a key is in a small manila envelope and the work \\"Black\\" is written on the envelope. Oskar thinks this may be one last way he can re-connect with his father; perhaps his father was going to send him on a scavenger hunt mission to find something somewhere and that the word \\"Black\\" was the only clue. Oskar starts by finding every person with the last name of \\"Black\\" in the five boroughs of New York City; this is a formidable challenge. Oskar tries to systematically find all the \\"Blacks\\" with fascinating results.<br /><br />Now of course many people will comment on how young Oskar is allowed by his mother to simply roam the streets unaccompanied until a mysterious elderly man (Max von Sydow) who rents a room from his grandmother (Zoe Caldwell) helps Oskar search; this is understandable because it simply isn't very believable. It's also hard to understand how such a young boy could walk (Oskar's afraid of subway trains) from Manhattan to Brooklyn and be the only person walking on a major bridge walkway.<br /><br />However, if you can look past these implausible parts of the plot, this is one powerful film and I won't tell you much more to avoid giving you spoilers! I left out some of the plot already and there's plenty more you will discover for yourself. Rest assured that the last half-hour of the film is unbelievably poignant; it's enough to make a stone cry!<br /><br />Look for more great performances by John Goodman as Stan the doorman; Hazelle Goodman as Hazel Black and cameos by Jim Norton as \\"Old Mr. Black\\" and Lola Pashalinski as Mona Black.<br /><br />Incredibly Loud and Extremely Close explores loss; coping with the loss of a very dear loved one and even forgiveness. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and anyone who appreciates emotional, heartfelt dramas will want to add this to their collections.ast name of \\"Black\\" in the five boroughs of New York City; this is a formidable challenge.

B009NOVCTM|5.0|GRRREAT! Is 2012 and we have more rolling stones music. This is cool, I love the cover is fantastic. It can be the last cd, who knows, but I preferred the rolling stones living and no dying. There are some radios stations supporting the new two singles, doom and gloom and one more shot. In Lima - Peru, the unique radio rock in Lima radio doble nueve is playing these two songs.
B000001EYO|3.0|I was disappointed it did not include alot of the music that was on the movie like viva las vegas
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|this does just what it says and more. guide is clear and easy to use.<br />hopefully reduce all my misplaced lists! great for the price.

B008JGSM6G|4.0|Very addictive, you start out simple and get more difficult with each level. Great for passing time in waiting rooms or sitting on the porch watching traffic.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|I just installed it my Kindle Fire and it only shows one page. &quot;page 1&quot; not &quot;page 1 of ....&quot; and it does not flip to the second page. It stays in a loop (circling icon) trying to load the rest of the pages but never does. It works fine in my Galaxy Nexus phone.
B0038AUYAU|3.0|Not my usual genre...a bit wacky but interesting and an easy read.  Ideal for kids or adults who like to read fantasy
B0083SBM7Q|5.0|My son and I saw this in the theater and loved it.  We've already watched it a couple of times together and it makes for a great night of us just hanging out and being pals!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I've started a drinking game because this app crashes so frequently and severely. It's lost my posts, crashes literally a dozen times in one session, crashes while trying to view messages and news, won't let me share to my public page, etc. It's the worst app I have EVER used.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Like so many movies, this one starts out as one thing, a cool sci-fi flick, and later changes into more of a horror blood and guts one, leaving one to wonder what the makers intended. Some scenes, such as the \\"self-surgery\\" part, could have kept the tension without the icky graphics. There are parts of the movie that are not original, but instantly recognized as coming from Aliens, etc. The first part of the movie in fact could almost be called son of aliens in it's set up. The movies premise is set up well, and the mid portion flows well, but the end section devolves into \\"this is silly, I can't suspend my belief anymore\\". The end and the script lines are like, \\"really?, seriously?\\" deflating. In a nutshell, the movie is underwhelming but moderately entertaining. Worth a $2-$3 rental, but not more.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|It's the type of programming that 'makes you anxious to see next epsiode'. Lots of unanticipated &#34;events&#34; in the program.

B0098460O4|5.0|Absolutely gorgeous!  I can't wait for the next CD!  They have such amazing voices.  Their voices work very well together.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This novel was a nostalgic trip through the 1980's, the only downfall is that it had to end.  I can't wait to read more from Mr. Cline.
B00112GVFO|4.0|A fun movie, different plot line and entertaining.  I enjoyed the scenic setting, and the characters were funny and wit.  Definitely worth a weekend afternoon diversion.
B008NA3I30|1.0|The characters are all really annoying and the whole movie is slow and painful to watch! Don't waste your time or money.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this app as a free app of the day. I don't know if I would've spent the five bucks on it, but after playing it as often as I do - I would. The game often has updates with new games, but I haven't even finished all the original yet.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|A great thing to play when you're not doing anything important. Definitely would recommend for anyone who likes a quick puzzle.
B0067TGSOK|5.0|I bought this book for two reasons, I like this guys attitude about business and Reviews where good, Read it twice and found out that inspiring as it is with the stories of the people and their successes, so this is how to take this. A bit short on the details. I love it, so will you...!
B001G7SS9G|5.0|I enjoyed the purchase. A must for movie and Will Smith fans. The price is great for what you get in the set.
B008458O3S|3.0|Really liked this game and enjoyed the clever challenges but last night's update appears to have broken the app.  Please fix.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Every Star Wars fan should, no needs this set. It's so awesome. What's more awesome is that it's in Bluray format.
B0090YHSFC|4.0|this game is the same concepr bouncing balls game on compaq way back then . bouncing red balls and u have to slice part of the space off. u lose a'life' if the ball breaks ur line b4 complete a slice . next round u get another ball added and the are bouncing faster. i think i only ever got to level 8 . i've been trying to find the game but cant even remem the name.  im taking this as a sort of substitute. Also if anyone knows about the intelligence quotient on playstation back then i'm looking for a game like it. I'm not as old as you are thinking.
B004WGIXX4|1.0|Story has no substance at all.  Transition between scenes is poor.  Slow and boring.  Not even worthy of my time to watch on a rainy day.  Talents are wasted in this movie.
B004AHNIGM|4.0|This is a pretty good CD. It has taken some time to get used to the music - little different from some ofthe other stuff, but all in all good music!
B005B0QYMM|4.0|Grave Encounters was not an easy film to watch.  I will admit what bothered me the most.  It was the cheesy acting by the lead character and the cutaway shaky cams BUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THAT WAY ON PURPOSE, so actually the film does exactly what it is trying to achieve.  It is a mock ghost hunting show.  So if ghost hunting shows is your thing, then you will relate immediately to what the movie is aiming for.  As with all horror movies, I recommend to anyone watching to watch it in the dark.  It will get you to jump in many memorable scenes and will give you a story that you will never guess the ending to and leave you wanting more.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|This is a great product, at a great price. If you are looking to build a decent machine on a small budget, this is a great choice. If you want to build a powerful gaming machine, this isn't your guy. It won't give you bragging rights, and it won't run Crysis 2 at a bazillion fps, but it is fast.<br /><br />My config is as follows:<br />MSI FM2-A75MA-E35 mobo,<br />Corsair DDR3 1600 (so I'm probably at the low end here)<br />SAMSUNG 830 Series 128GB SATA III SSD(not Samsung's latest, greatest)<br />Seagate Barracuda 1TB SATA III drive<br />Windows 8<br /><br />The SSD probably helps, and I think Windows 8 has also improved performance,<br />but I have never had a system this snappy. Not even my Macbook. Starts up quickly,<br />within 8 seconds after the Mobo splash screen(need to see if I can get a faster post on the Mobo)<br />Click on the browser, boom it's up.<br />Start a game, instant response. No lag in any of the games I have run so far, but I haven't<br />done much yet. Tried a DVD with Handbrake. Not very impressive, but I wonder if there are just certain limitations with decoding. Maybe I will update this review with some game specifics.<br /><br />Installs easily, includes fan and thermal paste.<br />Stock fan is fine for me, but I haven't checked temps while running games.<br />Haven't tried overclocking.<br />I can supposedly add a GPU(this APU supports Crossfire)<br /><br />So it runs great, room for upgrading, and all at a reasonable price.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|When I ordered this movie for the deep discount (I only paid $25 for it) I was expecting a set of Blu-rays. My highest expectations were that they would be in a nifty box. Obviously I didn't read the product info; I was just going on the fact that I love the Alien movies and that I needed to upgrade to Blu-ray. So when I got the product in the mail I was astounded. Not only is the packaging really sleek and cool, but the book-like DVD holders are awesome too. And that's not even mentioning the extensive bonus feature included with it all. Satisfied would be an understatement. If you are a serious fan of the franchise and would like to have a complete collection that looks great on a shelf, don't hesitate to buy this product.

0385536828|3.0|Ostensibly this is the story of Serena, a beautiful 20 year old girl living in London in the '70s. In the eyes of her father her life is a &#34; distant foolish thing&#34;. Women live in a world where &#34; only women who were in no mood to marry looked everyone in the eye and asked fearless questions&#34;.<br />  Serena negotiates this world by adopting behavior that is &#34; devious, deceitful, unkind and cruel--- counting on sex to put everything right&#34;. Her choice of lovers reveals a hidden distain and perhaps resentment of men:<br />  Jeremy, who though a generous and thoughtful lover to her, is never fulfilled himself....a situation she is insensitive to. ( he is later revealed to be gay)<br />  Tony, a 54 year old man she clinically observes before lovemaking to have &#34; a yellowish look like an old paperback&#34;, and whose &#34;skin hangs off him like pajamas&#34;.<br />  And lastly, Tom, a &#34;pale slightly stooped&#34;  writer who she lies to throughout  their relationship, never revealing that she is being paid to spy on him by M15.<br />  Deceit and cynicism are omnipresent.  Serena's father, an Anglican Bishop, is unconcerned when his other unmarried daughter becomes pregnant and his wife arranges an abortion.  His family never attends his church services.  Artists and intellectuals are surreptitiously funded by M15, their ideals corrupted for propaganda purposes. Governments betray their people. Love is self serving and dishonest.  Men are described as clever, amoral, inventive, destructive, single minded, selfish and emotionally cool but &#34; so necessary&#34;.<br />  Serena is a voracious reader of books of every genre.  She is able to speed read them because she skips all descriptive passages, concerned only with the action of the characters. McEwan has written this book with her in mind.  But if character is all, it must be dynamic. Tom is defined by his award winning, lackluster novel:  shallow and one dimensional.  Serena is, to use herexpression, a &#34;squit&#34;<br />  That is why the book doesn't work.
1935670913|2.0|First, I'll be honest: reading this book did give me a couple ideas though less for my book and more for using Twitter (I currently don't have a Twitter account but now see how it could be useful).  I can also tell he seems genuine about his audience and readers.  However, I'm glad this book was given as a gift and that I didn't purchase it myself.  Some of the criticisms:<br /><br />First, it's a very self-promotional book as many have already mentioned.  Second, I almost became sick at the number of exclamations he used.  It was easily 1 every 2 or 3 sentences, many right after another.  This just lends support to the fact that this book is more of a pitch from an actual insurance salesman than a how-to or useful book.  I believe another reviewer's analogy that it's more of an infomercial is spot on with the comments of \\"why would I give away a $10,000 idea for $4.99?!\\" where I can just hear \\"just wait, there's more!\\"  He is too busy touting his own success and what worked for him to actually break down what caused that success.  There's always a million ways to do things but if you're just giving someone 1 way and not breaking it down to the fundamentals then you're taking away their opportunity to figure out the other million and adjust it to themselves.  It's unfortunate that he was too focused on himself because if there were critical thought applied to this and targeted to his audience, as he likes to say, then it would probably be really useful.<br /><br />Of course, I have to mention what others brought up about Locke paying others to buy his books and leave positive reviews.  There was argument that commercials and actors do the same thing, but I don't think so... when you pay for positive reviews,  you eat away at the system itself which is why it is so offensive.  When we see a commercial we know what it is and what it's for, we know they're selling a product and we don't start questioning marketing and commercials themselves.  When you start being so shady as to pay for positive reviews, we then naturally question all other reviews, thus invalidating the usefulness of the review system itself.  His use of that tactic and his refusal to put it in this book also makes one question all his other ideas.  If he approached it as a whole system and actually judged what parts brought him success that'd be one thing, but now we're left wondering how much success came from fake reviews and how much came from the ideas he hawked in the book itself.<br /><br />Lastly, his book is only aimed at authors that care more about sales than anything else.  He talks about the authors that want to create something meaningful and wasn't too dismissive of them/us, but he is only talking to those authors that would write only for sales.  So as he said, this may work for you, but for a lot of writers, it won't.<br /><br />So, overall, the book is very \\"meh.\\"  It had some ideas that made me think but then again I wasn't into Twitter before.  So take it for what it's worth.  It's at least a quick read... good luck on your writing.
B000OZ0N9E|5.0|I read the book for doing cross application integration with camel , gave me a quick start. I've loved most books i purchased in the signature series.
B002APU580|1.0|A truly awful version of a wonderful novel,  that clings to the<br />notion (from the 80's maybe) that gritty is good.<br />I think it would leave Miss Austen amused, bored, maybe<br />a little disgusted. I'm sorry, too, because I'm afraid a lot<br />of people will get their idea of the sublime Pride and Prejudice from<br />this oh so pedestrian, somewhat nasty movie.<br />Ick!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Great storyline- classic Rapp.  Nice blend of current events and realistic plot. Only problem is that it ends too soon.
B00992CF6W|4.0|When are we getting the 0.5.0 update? Apple got it yesterday, its supposed to be released in mid-November and I really want it wah
B00A12VW86|3.0|The ambition to release 3 separate LPs in short succession is admirable, but it's doubtful they had enough material to justify the decision. The first half of \\"Dos\\" is forgettable, but the second half (from Stray Heart) contains some excellent songs. To me, though, the biggest problem they are facing is retreading the same sound and lyrics and song structures they've honed over the last decade or more. I got it for $5, so I think it's worth at least that.
B009C5Z112|4.0|One word to describe Time I: Epic. While it may have been a long wait for what might seem like a short album, the quality of the work is fantastic and Jari's skill truly shines on this. It's not that it's too short an album, but it does leave you wanting more, otherwise it'd be a perfect five star review.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|this is a fantastic movie about music, music business and musicians´ life.<br />not the best direction of all times? not the best edition or whatever? who cares...<br />just go for it and let yourself go with this great story, full of emotion and nice vibes.<br />definitively recommended!
B0013UIUBC|4.0|Movie was a surprise, a great deal deeper then I thought , with a lot better acting from all involved, really a good value;
1619491486|3.0|Overall I really enjoyed this book.  Specifically, I liked the dialogue between the four main characters (Connie, Oliver Mellors, Sir Clifford, and Mrs Bolton) and I thought the plot (a titled British lady having an affair with a commoner game-keeper) was pretty good.  The famous (infamous?) sex scenes between Mellors and Connie were entertaining as well, and it was interesting to read this book in 2012--52 years after the historic obscenity trial that allowed this book to be published at all, and also the same year that a book like \\"50 Shades of Grey\\" would find itself on the New York Times bestseller list.  How far we've come!  However, I was less impressed with the book's underlying theme of the social blight upon England, and found Mellors' solution of dressing miners in red pants and white jackets to be pretty silly.  Surely DH Lawrence couldn't have thought that was really the answer to the world's problems?<br />In any case, that aside, I thought this was a good read.
B00000IQW5|4.0|Bought this because saw a piece of it on tv once... Dreyfus , hunter, give superb performances.... I wonder why this movie was not a big hit, or maybe it was....
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Nice features: Can be used with multiple components.. I have mine hooked up to receiver and can listen to w/e else is fed into my receiver. Only issue I had was crackling/popping sound which was pretty bad.. Had to shut off routers near the X41 base station to get it to go away..(I have not tried changing channels on the routers)  In my house I have a main router in one room and a secondary slave in another using WDS (wireless link)so that I can feed ethernet from the secondary to various components.. I've since shut the secondary off and gone wireless with all my gear to my main router. I am going to hard wire with cat6 from the main router under the house to the living room and use a gigabit switch to hardwire my gear (best connection type): More stable, speed on local network and less interference with other gear, like the x41s) I'm not sure if the cracking is a flaw in the headset or the simple reality of using them or any others with lots of other wireless gear.. ?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've been playing solitaire ever since I was old enough to read the cards.  Runs in the family.  I've played on the computer since my first, a Mac Plus, back in the 80's. I've played at least a dozen different versions of solitaire and klondike.  Now I have versions on my iPod, laptop, and Kindle, and this is by far the best yet.
B009LL4LMM|3.0|it is a good game to burn some extra time! first few levels make it seem very easy but the third level is more challenging! my daughters love to take turns to see who could do it in less tries!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I use this app all day! I am able to track local weather &amp; weather in three other cities at the same time
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I origionally downloaded the free version and fell in love with this app. If you enjoy the free version, you should highly consider purchasing the full version.<br />This app allows you to create a unique soundtrack to sleep to. It allows you to choose high quality sounds and blend them to make the perfect sleep soundtrack. Once you create a soundtrack you love, you can save it for future use.<br /><br />The full version allows you to add sound waves to your soundtracks to help you fall asleep and reach deep sleep faster, meditate, or even concentrate better.<br /><br />This app helps me fall asleep at home and while I travel. I am usually unable to aleep on planes. I just used it on an international flight and was able to block out the plane/passengers and get some much needed sleep.
B000SW2F80|5.0|Delivered on time and packaged very well. This will certainly be a welcome addition to my movie library. Looking forward to viewing this in the upcoming days, of the winter doldrums.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's pretty good, it's just that the screen is touchy and sometimes the actions are delayed;( But overall it is a super adicting game that you will love!;) ENJOY
B00A0A6F7C|1.0|for a great new album from one of the most amazing singers of our time....however, I was immediately disappointed.  Susan has a tremendous voice, control, and style that stands alone.....but can enhance others without being over bearing. The duet with Elaine Paige post BGT rocked......that is where Susan needs to focus. Stand with and among the greats...and you will find your home...
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This album has a great sound. It has elements of blue grass and rock that blend very well. I have listened to it over and over and have not gotten tired of it and I bought it over a year ago.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|truely enjoy this game not to easy not to hard. plenty of mahjong tiles to match. play it quit often a good time burner
B004LWZW88|5.0|A very funny, well written, and entertaining animated film for kids and adults. Antonio Banderas is classic as the voice for Puss. Great supporting cast. A must have for animation lovers!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have to admit the last few Scarpetta books I found painful to read- I love the old school Scarpetta! Bone bed was a great read- perhaps it helped that hurricane sandy had forced me indoors but I loved this book and I look forward to the next one!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a great time spent with my son. He really was getting into it and was better than I was!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Not one of my favorite John Grisham's book.  Was hard to follow after his release from prison. But toward the end of the book couldn't put it down until I finished it.  Was trying to figure out what he was doing and of course in the end I did.  John Grisham is one of my favorite author so I knew in the end it would be hard to put down.
B008458O3S|5.0|Once you beat that level you've been working on for the last 10-20 minutes you feel like a genius, or at least I did. highly recommended.
B006GG1KOC|5.0|very clever game that teaches subtle skills such as differentiating objects. It would be nice if there were more levels.
B001EC2ISA|5.0|Early Alec Baldwin before his head literally got bigger. Fun effects and goofy characters. Great dance number but Michael Keaton really steals the show.
0345536886|4.0|John Grisham has certainly provided a book shelf of legal thrillers over the past decades as well as some books on other subjects. There is no doubt the man can write an entertaining story. The Litigators is a tale more true to life for a modern practicing lawyer of this day and age. Many lawyers will relate to the long hours of hard work that grow wearisome and relish following  the decisions of David Zinc, the main figure in this book. One morning he just ups and walks out of his high paying boring job in a large firm. After an all day bender, he stumbles, literally, into the shabby law office of Finley and Figg, a couple of losers. His life takes on a totally new pattern and the reader begins to cheer him on to success in life and a more rewarding career.  This is a departure from the usual page turner thriller with shots fired, the Mob lurking in the dark, and rampart evil afoot and those readers who expect that kind of plot will be disappointed. This book moves in a different direction and following it to the end will bring satisfaction to those readers who enjoy a departure from &#34;the usual characters&#34;.
B004TTHLBE|3.0|American Gods was written with Neil Gaiman's usual page turning talent. The Enhancements were a bust. I was unable to view them on my laptop Samsung phone or Kindle touch. No references were made to viewing/listening restrictions at the time of purchase. The books is well worth reading but don't pay for this version if it is going to cost more.
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|At the end of season 1, I was very concerned that they wouldn't be able to top it for season 2. I was wrong.
B000FA5SMK|3.0|I chose this book because I enjoy crime mysteries.  I enjoyed the setting and circumstances (NE U.S., and weather).but I the main character was not appealing personally.  I would recommend it to someone who enjoys fast reading.
B0081J95TE|5.0|This album is very addictive!  All the usual range of moods you would expect.  One of the best songs isn't on the non-explicit version (tan cover).  Be sure to buy this one (red).
B004SUWR2C|5.0|When we were on vacation we got stuck in our hotel during hurricane Sandy.  We played this game and it was fun.  I like that 1-4 people can play.  Try it out for fun.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|The app rarely works without me having to force close once or twice. Pictures either take forever to load or don't load at all. I realize the need to make money, but adding in ads to an app that barely works as it is, is a horrible idea.
B002PNAY9C|5.0|I have read all 4 editions and enjoyed them all.  The only parts of the book I did not enjoy as much is that Christopher Paolini does drag parts of the book out.  He does go into a lot of detail when describing different situations on Erogons travels.  He does bring all of his characters to life.
B004H1YH66|5.0|I went into the Raine re-recording with high hopes and an open mind, especially when I discovered that the Poledouris family was on-board with the Raine project.<br /><br />The short of it? This new production will not replace your original Poledouris recordings. Never. But Nic Raine's \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" ranks among the top ten, maybe top five, albums that I own. The conductor, orchestra, chorus, and recording are amazing. No, Raine is not Poledouris, but he and the Prague musicians may be as close as we'll ever get to the late maestro. Listening to some of the classic tracks, I felt the same thrill as when I was a teenager listening to the original score for the first time on stereo. Then there are the wonderful tracks we *never* got to hear, except on terrible bootlegs. Now we have everything we ever wanted, if not, sadly, from Poledouris himself, then from a conductor, orchestra, and chorus who do stellar service to the music. Great recording, great musicianship, great direction.<br /><br />That said, I should refer readers to F. Dean's thorough, perhaps definitive, review of the Raine recording. I concur with much of Dean's criticism, though not as strenuously. Again, the Raine recording is NOT the Poledouris version. Yes, Raine does an amazing job, and he channels Poledouris far better than you'd imagine from reading Dean's review. Raine does especially well with expansive, flowing pieces like \\"Wifeing,\\" \\"The Leaving/The Search,\\" and \\"The Orgy.\\" And he does well with the adrenalized pieces, too: you'll hear orchestral parts you may never have heard before. BUT--BUT--it's on these pieces that I most agree with Dean. The edge on \\"Anvil of Crom\\" and \\"Battle of the Mounds/Death of Rexor\\" is still sharp, but it's not vorpal-edge sharp like it is on the Poledouris recording. Poledouris and his musicians sounds like they're playing and singing for their very lives; they attack their music with Cimmerian fury. Raine and his musicians attack the hardcore pieces withprofessional gusto, but not quite with Cimmerian fury. The chorus, in particular, does not sing with the hair-raising passion of the Poledouris recording; the chorus sings beautifully, especially on the less violent pieces, but they seem unable to muster battle-lust when the songs call for it. Perhaps if Raine and his musicians had been under as intense pressure as Poledouris was, perhaps if they'd played to-the-movie rather than following the score freely, we'd have ended up with more Sturm und Drang.<br /><br />However, I do not mean to unfairly compare this amazing re-recording to the inimitable original. That would be a disservice to Raine and his musicians. Classic recordings are great, but music is meant to live, generation after generation, on the lips and fingertips of new musicians. And live it does, with Raine and the Prague musicians. It doesn't live quite the same way as it does under Poledouris's direction, but it's very, very close, and beautifully so.<br /><br />I've spent all weekend listening to the Raine CDs beginning-to-end. I feel like a kid again, and it's not even Christmas yet. Treat yourself to Raine and his musicians. Whatever the pros and cons on this recording, music like this is what's best in life.
B009D5VNLS|3.0|I like all kinds of  movies and had  high expectations  on this one but, it fell short to me mainly  because the story should of been better.<br />In some ways too simple and other ways didn't go anywhere; the story went places that it should of.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Another great thriller by Flynn. It is my favorite of her three books. I couldn't put it down. I am looking forward to more of her stories.
B0086449YA|5.0|Very impressive new album by Mark Knopfler ... and a double disc set no less. Can I say that it's doubly impressive? Well, I will. This is one of the sneaky albums that the more you play it, the more the songs grow on you. Pick your favorites; some obvious highlights and a few sleepers, but when push comes to shove, it's all good. And a double album?! Really, you won't find any filler on here. I read one review that lamented the fact that Mark isn't playing wildly inventive guitar riffs like he did back in the Dire Straits days. Well, I'm one of those listeners that prefers a solid finely crafted song over hot guitar licks any day of the week. And you have to give Knopfler credit for morphing into a genuinely excellent songwriter and all around talented musician and recording artist. Hot guitar players are a dime a dozen, but people who can write songs of this quality are a rare species. Sit back and savor this one.
0525952926|2.0|This book disappointed me.  It was not up to the standards of &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; which I liked very much.  While the storyline was good, the characters seemed phony and could not gain my sympathy.engagement or respect.  I stopped reading 1/3 of the way thru and gave the book away.  I have loved all of Follet's work until this one.  Verry sorry to submit this review!

1594203334|5.0|As soon as I got pregnant I started frantically buying/reading all kinds of baby related literature. There are too many \\"dont do this and dont do that\\" books out there. This one sounds more realistic and less scary. No, you will not kill your baby, if you eat a piece of sushi or drink a glass of red wine. No, you do not need to gain fifty pounds to have a healthy baby. I am having my husband read it now. He actually enjoys it!!!

B007SGLZP8|3.0|John Grisham has become too prolific a writer to be very good.  The Racketeer<br />is entertaining in its way, but the plot is a bit too contrived to be clever.<br />I think I'm over paying for Grisham books. I'll borrow next time.
0547995660|5.0|The Giver is a terrific read for anyone, but it's perfect for middle school students because it is so thought provoking.  It is the story of a controlled society in which there are no choices or conflict.  When Jonas turns twelve, he must train with The Giver and prepare to receive all the memories of love, happiness, war and pain.  During his training, Jonas learns the hard truth about his community and its rules and knows he must act decisively to bring about change.<br /><br />The best part about this book is that every word counts.  Lois Lowry is great at describing her characters and their community.  She includes meaningful foreshadowing that leads the reader through a gradual understanding of what might initially seem like an acceptable way to live.  She accomplishes this by revealing just enough details and we realize the facts just as Jonas does.<br /><br />The Giver ends just as you want to learn more.  And thankfully, there is more to the story in Messenger, Gathering Blue and Lowry's newest, Son.
B003Y5D776|1.0|[[ASIN:B003Y5D776 Griffin Technology 7725-IUAI iMic USB Audio Interface]]I purchased this device to amplify the output from a stereo condenser microphone.  If I plug in the microphone alone, I do get a small output from both channels.  If I plug the USB audio Interface into my usb port on the computer, plug the microphone into the input and plug a stereo patch cord from the output to the microphone input, I get nothing.  Amazon provided everything I need to ship it back for a replacement.  Except for it not working, I am a happy camper.
0385344228|3.0|What would you do if your teenage son were a murder suspect?  This is what Andy and Laurie Barber face when their son Jacob is arrested for the murder of his classmate Ben Rifkin.  William Landay shows how the Barbers navigate through the conflicting emotions of doubt and wanting to believe in Jacob's innocence.  And the Barbers' marriage suffers when Andy reveals a family secret to Laurie that calls Jacob's behavior into question.  The characters explore the interesting questions of nature versus nurture and the science of behavioral genetics.<br /><br />Sounds compelling, but the details of this story include average, unrealistic and random characters, unexplained details and a good dose of cheesy-ness.  I think Jacob's character, a 14-year-old eighth grader, acts more like a 16-year-old or older, especially in his use of vocabulary and ideas when he talks to his parents.  Side characters like Sarah Groehl, Matt Magrath and his mother seem to be important, but they are never fully explained.  The details of the crime scene are confusing and at times they seem to contradict earlier accounts.  In particular, the nature of Ben Rifkin's wounds seem to have some kind of meaning, yet their suggested significance fades away as the story continues.<br /><br />This is a plot-driven story and, despite the problems with characters and some details, there is a clear beginning, middle and end and that keeps the story moving.  Its twist at the end follows a predictable rhythm, but I think it raises reader interest.  Despite the average rating, I think the author raises thought-provoking questions about inherited traits.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Adam Brown was, and still is, a hero.  His story is as motivating and touching as you would see written in a fictional movie, only--its all true.  You can't help but to feel like you want to do something great after walking away from this book.  Highly recommended.
B008Y1NY14|1.0|I'm not sure if people do want to know about the history of css, where it might go in the future, and who is in charge of it, but that's the sort of stuff covered in this book.<br /><br />It has no code, or examples of interesting things you can do with it.
B00A6PD9I4|2.0|worst pixar story to date, visuals looked great though. but that can only take it so far. two stars at best
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|It is the philosophy of Ayn Rand...not the ATLAS SHRUGGED locked in Libertarian party that think they REFLECT her philosophy...the person that most reflects her thinking is John Stossel...live and let live!<br /><br />It is of course a very typical movie of the time...B&W, painted scenery...so if one is hung up on today graphics and special effects and the modern school of acting...they may not like it...it will seem a little hammy or theatrical.  If one is interested in the story and likes to read (and I also read it)  it is a short and good version of the story.  I also like silent movies.  If one has ever seen a Rudolph Valentino silent...once they take it seriously (the juvenile giggles) and understand the marvel is the ability to communicate without the voice...there are some really great acting silents and Valentino was actually a great actor.<br /><br />Fountainhead is a must for anyone that wants to understand Ayn Rand.  Just like Reading and seeing Atlas Shrugged.  If someone goes into it with totally preconceived thinking...it may or may not validate their expectation.<br /><br />If one sees it without any bias...just accept it for what it is...rather as Taming of the Shrew.  PBS wanted to make it politically correct!  I am so glad I have my Yale Shakespeare and Taylor and Burton having a rollicking good time with it.
B002O1TMI4|5.0|I'm eclectic to say the least. My favorite artist is Enya, my favorite genre is classical, and I enjoy one-hit wonders from the 80s.  As far as rock goes this album is one of my favorites.  The message laden lyrics bring out my anarcho-capitalistic side while providing a rich harmonic and melodic background.
B004LWZW4M|3.0|I have all the original movies and wished they had renamed and not given the movies the same name...you keep wanting to compare.<br /><br />The Planet of the Apes and &#34;Rise&#34; are sort of alike and the costuming and special effects are vastly improved...if you go to movies for costuming and graphics.  As with any of the movies spaced 40 years apart...technical movie making are worlds apart...which is also true of live theater vs. movies.<br /><br />So the point is  which do you want to really see.  acting or technique.  Please understand I am not a big Tim Burton fan.  I am a fan of Mark Walburg and Helen Bonham Carter...so the plus is...I like the acting of BOTH movies. But like Shakespeare or Jane Austin many fine actors do a great job in remakes of the same stories I have never read the novel (s) didn't even realize they were novels until I was asked to write this review.  And they are both really good.  I like the old movies, but same story the new version is just as good.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Not brilliantly written but a facisnating look inside the mission. I found it a page turner and well worth readinh
B007A2O3FO|5.0|Some movies have that quality that you can like good music revisit in any number of times...it is the stuff classics are made of...like the &#34;Lord of the Ring&#34; series or Wizard of Oz.  You can see them several years later and somehow still fresh...like Jane Austin, Pride & Prejudice, et.al, where so many different actresses and actors do over and over...my favorite ever is the new one with Keira Knightley and Matthew MacFadyen.  Everything about it is Magnificent, the scenery, the acting (not to forget the wonderful performance by Donald Southerland) the music, the costumes and of course it is a beautiful story.  Even for me who doesn't like &#34;girlie movies&#34; much.<br /><br />From Time to Time is in the same but a totally new classic (1958 novel, The Chimneys of Green Knoew by Lucy M. Boston.) It can also be appreciated when one thinks of the Narnia/C.S. Lewis stories.<br /><br />Maggie Smith, oh well, a true Dame of actresses and is once again.  I don't know that I will ever be able to think of Timothy Spall other than as Peter Pettigrew in Harry Potter...but oh well,  the dangers of doing a GREAT acting job, being type cast.  But an excellent performance.<br /><br />It is simply a wonderful, feel good movie.
0451232852|5.0|I have loved every one of Ken Follett's books. They are obviously so thoroughly researched that one is justified in seeing them as truly history, not just historical fiction. There is always--as with Fall of Giants--a fascinating story line that pulls you along through an amazing 985 pages, for which I would never have the patience with any other author. I always learn so much from reading Follett, and did again this time. This was especially true regarding the relative culpability of Germany in starting WWI.
B004GYY714|5.0|I got this while looking for a way to listen to the local baseball game on my Kindle. Well you can listen to any radio station, except major league baseball! I think if it's on a public radio station that I can freely listen to on the radio I should not have to pay to listen on any device. But c'est la vie!  Ifound out while listening to local Christian radio that on my Kindle if you tilt it or shake it it will play a random station of the same genre- awesome!! Im finding many great stations by this happy accident- beware walking while listening though if you turn the divice you may lose the station you were listening to. Just hit the back arrow and click on \\"recent  and you can find it again.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I can't get enough of zombie movies so a zombie tv show was an awesome idea for me! The director(s) have executed this show flawlessly so far and I can't wait to watch more. This show really keeps the audience wanting more. This was a great purchase on amazon and I was able to watch it on my xbox which was an added bonus.
B0083H6AQA|5.0|Rob did a great job as he always does. What a life this movie portrays.  I would definetly recommend this to adults.
B008G59IKO|2.0|In all my days, I would have never guessed that I'd be rating a GD album so poorly. Let me start by saying that I have loved every album they've ever put out, including the B-Sides album. I'm one of the few die-hard Green Day fans left, as far as I can tell, who has been with them since the early 90's.<br /><br />I was skeptical when I first heard about this 3-album thing. But, I really enjoy Uno. I've had it on a constant loop since the day after it was released. Nothing groundbreaking, but it all sounded very good, and had all the ingredients that I like in a Green Day song. I got my hopes up for the 2 albums to follow.<br /><br />As for Dos, I could barely get through playing it the first time. I've listened to it through 3 times, just to be sure I didn't miss something... I didn't. Every song might as well be the same. They're uninteresting, the rhythms are confusing, there are no catchy hooks, and there's no melody to speak of. It sounds like they got drunk and jammed for 3 days straight inside a tin can, and made an album out of the stuff that could pass for songs. Some people like it because it sounds \\"different\\". I am ok with different, to some degree. To me, this just sounded bad. It was all chanting/talking to a beat. In ordinary circumstances, Billie Joe's voice is like butter to my ears. This album was a bucket full of rusty chains to my ears. If they wanted to stray from the Green Day \\"formula\\" and do a weird experimental album, that's cool. I see from a lot of these reviews that a bunch of people seem to really like it. I just hope that they got this weirdness out of their system, and Tre will come in and rock my socks off.<br /><br />For any big GD fans, buy it. It's ten bucks (or less for digital). Give it a listen. You'll probably either love it or hate it. Don't take these Amazon reviews' words for it. Nevertheless, I've offered my opinion.
B00005QFE5|5.0|I saw this movie after watching a home made music video, and it was more than I expected.  Way more.<br /><br />Just the simple, true, honest expressions of love in the countryside made the movie that magical.  I was amazed at how such simple gestures of undefended love can impact and move the human heart.  I was truly a non-pretentious, clear, and direct movie about how love truly conquers us all.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|The app looks nice wnd has decent features. Unfortunately, it crashes esch time i open the app and my stream has an update. Reopening it after the crash allows me to see the update. i would not recommend this application.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was reluctant to watch this film, as many people have recommended it to me but never found any interest in it.  Until I saw a review online stating that this was one of the greatest films ever made, I decided to take up my friend on his offer.<br /><br />What I witnessed was one of the greatest films of all time.  The greatest animated film I have ever seen, it touched my heart.  Sen, or Chihiro was the star of the film not for any other reason than because of her pure and generous heart.  Her compassionate nature really gave hope to the film, and made a seemingly chaotic world seem beautiful.<br /><br />The animated and epic nature of the film really brings optimism into life that one must watch the film to understand.  5 stars!!

B004HW7JH4|5.0|I really really like Mad Men, and this season was excellent as usual. I missed several episodes due to travel so I ordered the whole season. Each episode has a lot happening, but each episode is complete so it isn't necessary to have seen the previous episode to enjoy the one you're watching. All of the characters are interesting, and I like most of them most of them.Looking forward to the next season.
B008O9V4C2|4.0|Five stars ought to designate a true classic. This gets four. It ain't Aja or The Royal Scam. I like it very much, however, and listen to it a lot. If you're a Steely Dan fan and you haven't heard it, here's what you need to know. The great age of The Dan is way back in Donald and Walter's rearview mirror, but lest you entertain the sad thought that they have surrendered to unproductive geezerdom, occasionally trotting out an oldies show just to fatten their accounts before all the Boomers succumb, you should listen to this album and Becker's last solo outing, Circus Money. Sunken Condos is unambiguous evidence that Fagen remains a brilliantly sardonic observer of sideshow culture and situational mores. This set is WAY better than the often lugubrious Morph the Cat. In fact, I like it every bit as much as The Kamakiriad, almost as much as The Night Fly. Lots of fun hooks delivered high and tight by the usual suspects Donald has become accustomed to working with. And the lyrics are some of the most deliciously snarky he's written in a while. Quick - what's the last song about bowling that you heard? Standout tracks are Slinky Thing, Miss Marlene and The New Breed. Nobody plays the aging hipster or chronicles the aging roue better than Mr. Fagen.
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I found the book to be very entertaining and well written. I look forward to the next book in the series.
B00846REIS|2.0|Felt like I was reading a more dumbed down version of &#34;Fifty Shades&#34;.  However, I am planning to read the next two books because I like closure.
141694737X|5.0|Dear Zoo is a cute but simple story, with a flap on each page that varies slightly for variety but is simple enough for my little one's hands. One issue we've had with some flip books or feel books is that they don't have an activity on each page or some pages are duds compared to others. These are all pretty consistent. Also, the flaps are sturdy, which is important since my son will tend to try to pull and bend.<br /><br />The words develop into a simple rhythmic story that is easy for young children to follow, even if they don't yet understand the words. My son is fascinated by this book and I love it too. I'm very glad I bought it and I would give it as a gift and/or recommend it to others.
B0090NNQX6|4.0|Mika is still a well kept secret in America. \\"The Origin of Love\\" is his third album and he still has not hit it big here (but should have already). He's never boring--with all three albums being diverse and entertaining. He is, in my estimation, a master pop tunesmith. Like George Michael, Robbie Williams or even newer artists like One Direction and OneRepublic, he has the talent, training and execution of someone who will be around for years to come.<br /><br />\\"The Origin of Love\\" finds Mika putting hooks into every song. Whether it's the interesting title track, or the casual \\"Lola\\", or the Benny Benassi dancefloor beat of \\"Stardust\\", or the metallic \\"Make You Happy\\"--the first four tracks are not alike in any way, and yet they all bring the memorable melodies and hooks with them.<br /><br />This isn't to say that \\"The Origin of Love\\" is perfect. No, \\"Underwater\\" sounds too much like OneRepublic, and \\"Kids\\" might be to skippy and light on hooks to qualify as a highlight. \\"Step With Me\\" might round out the weaker tracks, but even these three are not weak enough to detract from the overall cohesiveness of the album. They are diversions, experiments that almost hit the mark, but stray from it just slightly.<br /><br />\\"Overrated\\" sounds like Baltimora's \\"Jungle Boy\\", but it's a highlight here. \\"Love You When I'm Drunk\\" could be a cousin to the Pet Shop Boys' \\"You Only Tell Me You Love Me When Your Drunk\\", and is also quite catchy.<br /><br />\\"Popular Song\\" is extremely infectious and could easily be a single and fit into several radio formats. \\"Emily\\" is the English lyric version to \\"Elle Me Dit\\", and the two tracks are, I think, slightly different productions. I prefer \\"Emily\\" over \\"Elle Me Dit\\", and \\"Emily\\" is another potential hit. \\"Heroes\\" is solid, and \\"Celebrate\\" could easily be another hit.<br /><br />In fact, of the 13 tracks, they all have some potential to have chart success. Mika just needs more exposure and better marketing in the U.S. \\"The Origin of Love\\" nearly cracked the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 Albums Chart. This means there is a fan base here and the potential to reach more untapped music listeners. The bonus track \\"Tah Dah\\" on the second disc could have been the final track on the album (and it is if you shuffle the songs around like I did).<br /><br />All the other bonus tracks are fine. The five acoustic version are pretty decent. The remixes and edits are just okay--they don't surpass the originals in any way.<br /><br />So, once again Mika has turned in another fine effort here. Why does Gotye get all the airplay and Mika very little? Why does One Direction end up on top along with Carly Rae Jepsen, but Mika does not? These things don't make sense. Mika is a trained musician and it shows. He can play, he can sing, he is inventive, he is entertaining--all the things you'd want in a pop star. The one thing he has left to prove is his songwriting. As I said earlier--echoes of George Michael and Robbie Williams, but the difference between the two is George Michael is the better lyricist, while Robbie Williams has relied solely on his pop chops. Will Mika ever write something like \\"Father Figure\\", \\"Faith\\", \\"Freedom\\", \\"Mother's Pride\\", \\"Heal the Pain\\", \\"Jesus to a Child\\", \\"Outside\\", \\"Amazing\\" or \\"Easier Affair\\" like George did? Time will tell. His songwriting is the one thing that could push him into superstardom if he writes something more meaningful.<br /><br />Here's how \\"Origin of Love\\" compares with Mika's previous works:<br /><br />2007 Life in Cartoon Motion: Four Stars<br />2009 The Boy Who Knew Too Much: Three and a Half Stars<br />2012 Origin of Love: Four Starsve\\" nearly cracked the Top 40 of the Billboard 200 Albums Chart.

0765356139|5.0|This book continued onward from the end of it's predecessor \\"Mistborn: The Final Empire\\",which was a fantastic book with great sequences of action, and lots of hidden mysteries. This book is much more slow, it seems to focus on building its characters much more than the first one did. It also doesn't just focus on Luthandel, but seems to zoom out, letting in a multitude of other cities, and their problems, into the plot. With all of this going on we see Elend Venture trying to control the vast regions that The Lord Ruler previously ruled over. We see Vin, discovering more of herself and trying to piece together what happened to her. Also the Crew, they continue to help, separating themselves at times so that we the readers can see what they actually want. This book sets up an amazing squeal to finish up the series. I give it a five out of five for its amazing character development, beautiful plot, and its new encompassing setting.

1936608618|5.0|This book is a must read for any endurance who athlete who wants to maximize results and improve performance without beating themselves into the ground with long, boring training sessions.  At the same time, Brian's methodology enables you to get stronger, faster, and more powerful while getting prepared to go for the long haul on race day. I first met Brian at the CrossFit Endurance Seminar in Atlanta, January 2009 and have used his methodology and guidance to complete 3 100 mile ultras, an Ironman, and multiple 50ks over the past few years while staying strong, powerful, preserving my lean muscle mass, and preventing overuse injuries associated with traditional endurance training programs.

B009C5Z112|4.0|This is the new album we've waited for over 6 long years.  The album we begged for.  The album we made countless puns about.  It is finally here.<br /><br />But it's a completely different animal from the first album.  While the amazing guitar work is still there, it is often drowned out by layer upon layer of synthesized orchestration.  I find \\"Sons of Winter and Stars\\" to be an especially bad offender in this regard.  There's a rehearsal version on one of the special editions of the album; I'm not sure which one, but on that version, you can hear all the wonderful guitar work that's buried down in the mix.  I would also have been very happy if they had broken \\"Sons...\\" up into separate tracks, but it stands well as it is.<br /><br />Personally, since my free time is limited, and the intro and first track are very long, it took me a while to get past them into the rest of the album.  That is something I find especially unfortunate, since I think the latter part of the album is better than the first.  \\"Land of Snow and Sorrow\\" is a natural extension of some of the more mellow songs from the first album, such as \\"Sleeping Stars\\".  After that is \\"Darkness and Frost,\\" an instrumental, and introduction to the final track, \\"Time\\".  Much as I generally dislike instrumentals and intro tracks, \\"Darkness and Frost\\" makes a really good segue.  It helps move the mood away from the calm melancholy of the previous track, to the more intense emotions of \\"Time\\".<br /><br />Overall, I give the album 4 stars.  It's not the new Wintersun album I wanted, but is solid in its' own right.  Only time (ha, time!) will tell if I'm still listening to this one 8 years after release, like I am with the self-title.
B004L03B3S|4.0|The lovers are half-brothers growing up with their mother and her second husband, the father of the younger brother.  When her visiting first husband wonders if the boys are too close, mother thinks their boyish affection is just fine.  The elder father passes away;  ten years later, the mother dies as well.  The boys (now grown) take each other sexually it seems just as they return from her funeral.  Their love for each other keeps her alive within each of them; she even appears with them as a loving ghost in a fantasy sequence.<br />A Freudian would point out that their homosexual love is an acceptable sublimation for excessive mother-son intimacy, especially when it neutralizes any mortal rivalry between the boys for their mother's love.  That they are not boy-girl and not full biological brothers reduces the horror of their incest to tolerable levels, and allows an open minded viewer to rejoice for their happy lives together.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I personally liked the book from cover to cover. I however failed to see what the gubermint had such a problem with. Sources were cited as to where factual information was inserted and other things were omitted. The story was nothing out of this world or new. It read like other factual special forces books. It was a good read to see the perspective of this event.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|Purchased this when I had a Kindle and enjoyed reading it. I have since gone to the &#34;other&#34; side and have not reloaded this into my Kindle app.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|A very interesting book for any fan if baseball or sports in general. The insight to the internal workings of a baseball club is quite fascinating.  Lewis does a great job explaining the history and culture of baseball.  He keeps the story moving while giving insight to people and events.<br />My only criticism is the writing gets tedious sometimes when talking about the statistics - not that I dont enjoy the stats but felt Mr. Lewis failed to keep them interesting.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Interesting story, awesome magic system, complex characters, wrapped up in a beautiful language - all in all a really good small package of a novel.
3836503050|5.0|Interesting vintage photos. Well capture the spirit of the time. Recommend to lovers of history 50-60 years. All right. Ok.
B0055SWM08|3.0|its boring but keeps my attention for a few minutes. I would not have bought it if I knew what it was like.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Might not be for some people due to the nature of the book, but if that doesn't bother you then hold on cause its quick but very exciting ride.
B007712XAU|5.0|Episode 8 and the Christmas special are found on the special features disc! Fabulous show - I highly recommend it for anyone loving period dramas and/or Dame Maggie Smith.  She is delightful!!!
1451648537|5.0|We got tired waiting in the que to borrow this book from library so we bought it on line.  It's one of the most exciting book we've ever read!
0061537969|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time.  Very funny, yet heartwarming and moving at the same time.  Mr. Stein is one of my new favorite authors.
B00A2H9LK6|5.0|I consider the first Silent Hill my favorite horror flick. It has beautiful cinematography, a great cast, nightmarish/disturbing imagery, and some neat monsters. The sequel continues much in this same vein, with returning characters and a few new additions, including Game of Thrones' Kit Harington. For those of you who have played the third game in the series, a direct sequel to the first, this is a fairly accurate adaptation of it--from the characters (love Adelaide as Heather), the monsters (including a cameo of Robbie the Rabbit), and the plot. If you liked the first film, definitely check this one out. It's faster paced, shorter in length, and overall fun little thrill ride.
B007UXSPK2|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.<br /><br />This movie will kill brain cells.<br /><br />The plot is full of holes.<br /><br />Many scenes that are designed to be exciting, just left me saying, \\"Yeah right.\\"<br /><br />A lot of other stuff is just stupid.<br /><br />A twenty-foot wide fan for cooling computers in Mumbai? Please.
B00631VJIC|5.0|The songs on this soundtrack were EXACTLY what I had hoped for!!!  I was extremely happy with the collection of songs on this album, and I think that everyone else will be too!!!  Got a wonderful deal on this.  CD was worth every penny!!  And then some!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It just keeps getting better and better.  I'm actually watching it form the beginning again. Amazing what new details you can spot that related to the current series.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My grandson downloaded it for him and now i play it all the time! You get nothing for your time, it's just very addictive
B001NHNG64|5.0|I've newly discovered Childs writing.  Great story line and hard to put the thriller down.  I will read more by this author.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|The beginning of the book is a little hard to get through, almost put it down. That would have been the worst mistake of my life!<br />This book, when read and actually digested line by line, is very poignant.The Domestication chapter is so illuminating as to why I have been so conflicted for what seems my whole life.<br />This book I have now re-read so many times, even if only a certain agreement or paragraph.I find more peace, forgiveness and understanding about myself, my family and even total strangers. It has opened my eyes and my heart. I read the book nearly a year ago and have put the agreements to work. I feel a reduction in anxiety, loss, sadness and longing for feelings  and material things. The book is really an honest recognition of ones self.One realizes it's not one's fault for unhappiness and gives the exact \\"thought\\" tools to live a much happier life.If you truly seek happiness this is the book! The only way to let this book work it's magic is to read it slowly, allow yourself to digest it, paragraph by paragraph and it truly goes from being a \\"small\\" book to one of the largest, life changing books you can read.I bought the download version as a gift for someone.<br />This man is a blessing to all who read his words, I cannot thank him enough!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Great movie. Cast is wonderful, and the story line is great.Judy Dench is great again.<br />Would like to see a sequel to this movie.
B008CP6RWU|3.0|Journey CE is a collection of 3 PSN titles and 3 small indie games.<br />the indie games are nothing special, and never were meant to be, lets get them out of the way, and just say, they are fun for a few minutes at best if you have friends, now to the meat of the game.<br /><br />Flow-<br />Flow is a weird game, the whole collection is weird but flow... well, it's like that game where you are a fish, and eat all the other fish to get bigger. you are an animal in a deep dark ocean and swim around ( with the motion controls) and feed, some other animals might want to eat you, some just swim around. you can keep going down and basically you unlock new animals to play as. each animal has it's own \\"special\\" ranging from  swimming a bit faster to going invisible.<br />you can technically \\"beat\\" the game in like an hour, but the point of this game is meant to be a simple and allow yourself to just get into it.<br />Flow has some hard trophies, such as finishing without eating another animal.<br />The biggest issue with flow is the controls, motion controls are annoying I wish they were optional because controlling your fish can be frustrating sometimes.<br />In the end, flow is an ok game, you will probably play it a bit, but once you play it a few times you will never touch it again.<br /><br />Flower- Flower is probably the most relaxing game I have ever played, it was strange how even though it is stupid it is something I not only finished, but I played some levels over again just because. In flower you are a flower petal and you use motion controls to fly through the air, and hit other flowers, doing this releases 1 petal that follows you, by the end of the level you have hundreds of petals following you. It sounds dumb, but the game is relaxing.<br />the worst part of flower is there are only a few levels, I wish it would keep going but it doesn't.<br />all the trophies in this game are easy except 1, and another that simply needs lots of play time. I think flower ismy favorite game in the collection.<br /><br />Journey- People love this game, I can honestly tell you I don't see the big deal, people are saying they were crying by games end? just no.<br />what the game DOES offer, is an adventure, the multiplayer in the game is well done, any random person can join your game and help you but not talk to you, I had some cool guy join and i followed him to some items to make my person better ( at least I think)<br />Journey is a short game, but the gameplay is a bit lacking. I would say play the demo for it, if you like that you will love this game.<br /><br />extras- the game also comes with soundtracks ad themes to some of the games. I REALLY like the flower theme and use it for my ps3, it's pretty awesome, depending on the time it is night or day in the background. I also like the flower soundtrack it is relaxing.<br /><br />The current price of this game is about $30 I feel you can get some better deals for the price, but if you play the demo for journey and love it I would get this instead. I picked up the game for $15 which is the perfect price point.<br /><br />I say wait for price drop, but it is worth buying in the near future.
B0035LGXXO|5.0|I've loved this movie since it came out.  It's a shame it isn't shown on movie channels like HBO, Cinemax, and Encore.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I looked forward to reading the book, a real page turner.  I'm not sure if I liked the ending or maybe I just wanted a different ending.
B002LAM7PI|1.0|Since posting the review below, M. Manville set me straight that the comments on Amazon.com for this movie are combined for all available versions of the movie.  So if you are looking at the Coraline blu-ray version that says anaglyph, you are looking at the red/blue glasses 3D version.  Coraline is also available in 3D for 3D capable tv/blu-ray players.  If you find the \\"Other Formats & Versions\\" section on the webpage, click on the '+' symbol to expand out the list.  From there, there are a couple of 2 disc blu-ray versions and one of them is a link to the newer 3D version (at the present time it is the most expensive at $29.99)  The product photo clearly shows that the box is marked 3D.<br /><br />**********<br />The product description is vague and should point out clearly that this IS NOT the great quality 3D that we experienced in the theater when this movie came out and that our newer 3D tv's and blu-ray players have (and that they describe in the Amazon's Editorial Reviews section on the product page).  This is the old-school red and blue glasses 3D from back when 3D sucked.  I guess we're supposed to know that Anaglyph 3D means red/blue glasses type.<br /><br />I made the mistake of believing another reviewer on Amazon who was either lying about the type of 3D or didn't know what he was talking about.<br /><br />Hope I saved you the $10 until they release this in all its original high quality 3D glory!
098478280X|3.0|It's good for you to get a job. However, u get a job instead of a career from this book. I only have one question, since I can rewrite your book using 200 pages, why do u have to span it over 500 pages? Obviously the author is not very good at answering her own questions.
B003LXSY60|5.0|I love the black keys and this has become one of my favorite albums.  Definitely a must buy!  Thank you.
0451232577|4.0|As a non-fiction avid reader  (military,  political)I was skeptical to read historical fiction, but I  admit this  book was a great read. Ken Follett presented  references to actual facts: politics, society,  events, personality traits  that would satisfy any  crital reader.  Often times, I chucked at his clever use of words that had a deeper meaning if you knew the background. Likewise I gained new knowledge (the Welsh)  which made the book all the more interesting.  Looking forward to next book.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|I am having a hard time keeping track, but I am stubborn and am hopeful things will connect soon.  The idea of this book is intriguing and why I wanted to read before seeing the movie.  Even so, I still think this book is worth reading.

B0083P1QUM|3.0|But I am missing some of the romance and excitement of her characters former books.  It seem this book is more about technical things and less about the main characters
B0083SBJXS|4.0|This was great! I pre-ordered it and it arrive the morning of the release. And of course it is a phenomenal movie!
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Great Action, and a very good story.  This kind of film has been a long time coming.  Hollywood has no new ideas, so why not go back our youth, and use comic books.  The stories were intense, and exciting.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I am able to download books etc. in PDF format from my laptop to be easier to take with me.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this game because of a similar one I love on my DS. This is a lot of fun, I can't put it down. I also love how you get new puzzles. Hope they come out with more.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the only thing missing is the new update for the kindle fire.!  When can we expect it to come out?
B001O1O71C|5.0|Perspective of a naive child living very near the horror of the holocaust concentration camps.  Fascinating and terribly sad at the same time. A quick, must read.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|The following lists the differences between the webisodes and the full Forward Unto Dawn (hereinafter \\"FUD\\") movie (SPOILERS FOLLOW!!):<br /><br />1) There is a 4-minute pre-opening credits scene that shows the incoming freshman cadets Lasky, Vickers, Sully, Chen, Silva, Tchakova and upperclassman Orenski either getting their heads shaved and/or delivering brief speeches regarding their purposes for joining CAMS.  The scene is juxtaposed with various training montages and shots of CAMS & UNSC military personnel.<br /><br />2) The opening/closing credits are longer.<br /><br />3) There is an approximately 4-minute blooper reel following the end credits.<br /><br />And that's it!  Unfortunately, no added action scenes, gore, or extended clips of Master Chief.  If you've watched the webisodes, then you've watched the majority of the movie.<br /><br />I've never been much of a Halo gaming fan, although I have always found the mythology fascinating.  I had high hopes for a Halo movie when Neill Blomkamp first directed the Halo 3: Landfall shorts.  FUD gives us a taste of what we can look forward to and I hope Microsoft acts quickly.  With the new Star Wars trilogy slated to be released in 2015+, perhaps there will be renewed demand for sci-fi movies.<br /><br />Despite its low budget, FUD has high production values and good CGI.  Battlestar Galactica veterans like Mike Dopud (Specialist Gage) and Ty Olsson (Captain Kelly) make appearances as the superintendent of CAMS and an older Lasky, respectively.  The plotline is Starship Trooper-esque (the movie, not the book) formulaic.  Young group of cadets enroll in military academy, with certain fortuitous events occurring just before the main character decides to abandon his promising military career.  FUD builds up slowly before Master Chief is unveiled but it's an unforgettable entrance.  I appreciated FUD's attention to detail, such as showing falling bodies when the space tether was destroyed, Fred-104 in Master Chief's field of view, ODSTs dropping into battle, and Master Chief's emphasis on pistol usage.<br /><br />I did have an issue with the end scene where Lasky acts as a decoy to save Master Chief and his fellow cadets.  I thought the point of FUD was to show Lasky's evolving maturity, but he only seemed like his usual reckless self.<br /><br />Given FUD's internet popularity, I think this bodes well for a potential cinematic incarnation.
B001RIY4WE|3.0|Met my expectations, takes a little while to load, maybe it was my player. I'll keep both versions this one and the regular dvd.
1451695195|5.0|This is definatly a must read book if you have any doubt about what is to come after this life is over. This book has inspired me to come out and disclose my own NDE that happened 22 years ago. I will not go into my own experiance because this is a review of Dr. Alexanders experiance. This book is well written and easily understandable. Dr. Alexander has done well in explaining the unexplainable. Our minds are way too small to understand what is to come after this life, yet this book puts that experiance into a perspective that points our understanding in the right direction. Thank you Dr. Alexander for overcoming the fears of sharing this experiance, I believe it was the reason you were allowed to come back.
0525478183|3.0|Generally I enjoy young adult books. I began to read this novel and found it slightly intriguing. But after a few chapters, I just plain lost interest. Don't get me wrong: The author is a good writer of fiction, nothing amiss there.  But to be honest I gave up early-on, didn't feel motivated to read on.
1611133408|5.0|I bought the audio version of TLOS.  I'm very picky about who reads novels.  Chris Colfer is one the best, and  I have heard many many novels on CD.  He gives each character thier own voice and there are a lot of them in TLOS.<br />My favorite is Connor, one of the twins.  His take on how and why the fairy tale characters are the way they are is hilarious.  I want to give an example, but I won't give any spoilers.  I can't ruin your fun.<br />It was hard to find a stopping place when real life intruded on this fairy tale land.  You want to know what happens next.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Haven't yet finished this book but am having trouble putting it down.  Love John Corey and Nelson DeMille's writing is amazing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Bought all three books for my kindle!  Awesome books, wish there were more! Order processed immediately as soon as I ordered through amazon!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I purchased this book after reading Pillars of the Earth.  I wasn't going to but then I saw the 2nd book in the Fall of Giants trilogy.  I bought Fall of Giants and I am loving it.  I can't believe it took me this long to find Ken Follett.  Amazing author.  I am totally absorbed in the life of this characters and can't wait to move on to the next book.
B007MDB548|3.0|I own all the new tinkerbell movies starting with tinkerbell (which came with my trial disney movie subscription), with the exception of \\"The Great Fairy Rescue\\" they are all wonderful! The visual effects and scenery of the wonderful world of fairies is worth getting the blu-ray version!<br /><br />We have always wanted to go into the winter woods area out of pixie hollow and now you can in a movie that my 5year old son, my husband, me, and my young niece all enjoyed it, whats more is even my son who has been all about \\"boy things\\" asked to watch it again and again.<br /><br />*If you're looking for Terrance (my favorite character besides tinkerbell and rosetta-HES NOT IN THIS MOVIE-also the snowball fight scene from some of the preview/trailers also didn't make the final cut : /<br /><br />If you loved tinkerbell or have a family with young children you wont regret buying this. I gave it 3 stars because you wont find the dialogue or slapstick joke after joke of some of the popular films today but this is a classic and a keeper :)
B003BOUKRU|3.0|Buyers be aware that this Blu-Ray as advertised is Region B/2: Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  Amazon needs to include more information about this fact other than the very brief statement in product detail.  Will not work in Region 1 Blu-Ray players, but will play in Region Free players.
B006VKKAWQ|5.0|This set is a staggering value.  If your previous experiences with Toscanini recordings have been sonically painful and unhappy ones, as were some of mine, this set goes very far toward correcting a sorry record of sloppiness and neglect.  Performances that used to sound like they were the product of a miserable band of fiddlers locked in a tiny room with a furious old man now sound open and spacious. Recordings that seemed more static than music are musical.  In addition to poor sound, Toscanini has often been identified with rigidly fast tempi.  This set will let you hear how warm and musical the NBC Symphony could be--for example on the Debussy disc--and how the conductor's performances, while always taut and energetic, could be flexible, yielding, and even gentle--the final minute or two of the Philadelphia Orchestra version of Berlioz's Queen Mab Scherzo is a perfect example of the latter, where the mad rush of the coda is preceded by quiet, thoughtful and unhurried music making.  Of course, no one can restore sound that wasn't captured.  You won't mistake anything here for a modern digital recording.  But the sound here is consistently decent mono from the 'forties and 'fifties.  I am still working through the set, and I'm sure there will be some disappointments, but there have been none so far--only the joy of listening to the music making of one of the finest and most honest musicians of our times.  If you love great performances of orchestral music, do not hesitate to purchase this set.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Well, I'm hooked.  Everyone said I'd like this and I finally gave in and ordered the Blu-Ray for Season 1.  I've already ordered Season 2 and can't wait for Season 3 to come out.  It's not about the zombies, and yet it is.<br /><br />TT

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett's Winter World is a journey through WWII through the eyes of beautiful characters. It is a captivatinglu written and full of great detail.  I so enjoyed it.
B0030B624E|3.0|The movie itself is great on both DVD and Blu-ray.<br /><br />The quality of the amazon digital version is very low. Is very blocky even on a midsize screen. Despite the fact Amazon advertises their movies as DVD quality its nowhere close. I even downloaded it just to be sure, and the quality was still the same.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|First, a little background.  I have served in the United States Air Force, United States Air Force Reserve, and am currently a member of the Illinois Air National Guard.  I have been a cargo pilot my entire career and am at 22+ years and counting.  This is a well written story of an American hero's life.  If your faith in God has waivered, this book will make you believe again.  If your faith in your family has weakened, this book will make you strong again.  If your faith in friends has slipped, this book will place you on firm ground again.  Because of Adam Brown's love for his family, country and fellow SEALs, he earned the gift of redemption.  After reading this book, I have become a better man.  I am quicker to ask, \\"How can I help?\\" and more ready to follow through when the answer comes.  Read it--by yourself.  Let the story affect you and cry if you need to.  I did--more than once.  After you have read this book, never let weakness, or weariness, or pain get in between you and your goals.  This book is inspirational because this man was inspirational.  Read it with an open mind and an open heart--you will not be disappointed.  I have never reviewed a book on Amazon before, but I could not hold my feelings in.  After I read this book, I sent a copy to my 5 closest friends from my days of Air Force Service.  They're the only ones who could possibly understand where this amazing story took me.  Read it.
B005VT42BS|5.0|works great on my razr maxx. can see all devices on my home network and many other useful tools. i have not tried any of the paid services.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The Grisham style didn't disappoint but I found this one less compelling than others.  Couldn't really get connected to any of the characters and the central theme was only marginally interesting.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I got it on my phone and got.an upgradenwhich has paintings in stuff how do I up grade on kindle fire I wonder
B003IWRE3I|2.0|I'd heard that this was an awesome movie, so I sat back and gave it time to become awesome. And more time. And more. In fact, I kept hoping right up until the end that it would become awesome. Sadly, it never did.<br /><br />This is a (depressingly) beautiful film, despite its largely grey palette. The actors gave creditable performances, especially Viggo Mortensen, whom I've not been this impressed with in any other film. The pervading sense of horror is well done.<br /><br />But the plot/theme--like the whole trip to the coast itself--goes absolutely nowhere. There isn't even a thematically useful sense of despair upon their arrival at...just more of the same. The uncertain deus-ex-machina ending, while *marginally* believable, also seems only marginally related, thematically, to the rest of the story. I get the sense that maybe somehow it was all *supposed* to click. But it didn't.
B0044WUJQ0|5.0|This movie picks right up were the first ended. That was a great way to start, nothing is worse than a sequal that has nothing to do with the previous movie. This movie is a great way to spend some down time and relax.
B004SIP6BI|5.0|One of my all-time favs, this was a gift to someone who'd managed to never have seen it. Knowing the quality of this film, that oversight had to be rectified immediately so I purchased the DVD. I'd intended to send it to them along with a bar of Chili Chocolate. However, at the prospect of the chocolate melting all over the movie, I decided it was wiser to send the DVD without it. Sadly, I was forced to eat it myself.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this app rocks!!!!! I luv it THANK U PPL WHO INVENTED CUT THE ROPE U ROCK!!!!!!!!! IF THERE WAS A 100 STAR THATS WHAT I WOULD RATE THIS APP!!!!!!!!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Aptly named, Relax Melodies Premium is definitely worth the cost. Has a wide variety of sound choices and each sound has a volume control, enabling you to turn up the sounds you really like in your mix, and relegate other sounds to the background. Also has a timer with a custom feature, and will turn the app off afterwards.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|The movie is fun to watch.  It wasn't like the old dark shadows, this is set in modern times.  Jonny Depp is great.

B009VLX8FS|5.0|Not really a Taylor Swift fan, but this album speaks to me... I like every track.  Good work Miss Swift:-)
B0041KVW2K|2.0|This is a very honest review. In terms of sound quality, I think its pretty good and I am an audiophile. Much of the mastering is a bit \\"sanatized\\" but the tracks and vinyl are clean and quiet. So what is my real issue here? Why did I receive a set (as did MANY MANY MANY others) that are warped? Seriously ? In this day and age with 180gr vinyl, there is no excuse for it. I will likely do an exchange but how will I know I wont get a scratched version (thats another common problem) or just another warped version.<br /><br />Parlaphone and Amazon, you guys blew this one. Vinyl lovers love clean sound, love the Beatles but buying warped records is like buy a new car with dents and dings. It just should not be.
B001DF68MA|5.0|My 20mth old son loves this seat. The fact that he can see what's going on because he is in front of the rider and feels more included during the ride. And the headrest is an added bonus as a rest stop or even a steering wheel. Love it!

B000MGQBQE|5.0|For those not already familiar with the play, it is the only one of Shakespeare plays without a recognizable source for the main plot, although there is documentation for many details in the voyage literature of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century, especially the earlier years of the Virginia colony. A few hints may have come from histories of Italy, but the names don't match up with any specific events. Most of the other parallels to the plot which have been identified are too general to tie directly to the play, although they may be helpful in understanding it.<br /><br />The grumpy magician, his beautiful daughter, the handsome young hero, and the magician's attendant creatures, are commonplaces of traditional fairytales and medieval and renaissance romances. (Not to mention a lot of modern genre fantasy, and older science fiction.) So, too, are wicked brothers and scheming courtiers.<br /><br />In other hands, these elements could have made a rambling crowd-pleaser like the then-popular \\"Mucedorus,\\" Shakespeare, who was at home with the plots spread widely through time and space, here makes them the subject of a tightly constructed play. As has long been noted, \\"The Tempest\\" is one of the few Shakespeare plays to observe the so-called \\"classical unities\\" of (elapsed) time and a single place, in this case, a few hours on an enchanted. In this is its unlike most other Elizabethan and Jacobean \\"romance\\" plays, very much including his own earlier ventures, such as \\"Twelfth Night\\" and \\"A Winter's Tale.\\"<br /><br />\\"The Tempest\\" is one of my personal favorites in the Shakespeare canon, and it has inspired a long series of pastiches, retellings, parodies and satires, adaptations, operatic adaptations, and just plain productions. (My personal pick -- a purely sentimental one -- is \\"Forbidden Planet,\\" the 1956 movie starring Walter Pidgeon, Anne Francis, and Leslie Nielsen, all upstaged by Robbie the Robot, in a double role emulating both the helpful spirit Ariel and the bumbling Caliban.)<br /><br />Anyone considering ordering THIS particular edition should be aware that it is part of the OLD \\"Pelican Shakespeare\\" series issued 1956-1967, under the General Editorship of Alfred Harbage. It was published by Penguin Books, which then used the Pelican imprint for various types of non-fiction books and editions of literature. Each volume had \\"Shakespeare and His Stage,\\" a brief essay by Harbage, and an introduction by the editor of the play. The early editions were instantly recognizable as mass-market (small) paperbacks with spines and covers mainly in pale blue. A compendium, \\"The Complete Pelican Shakespeare,\\" with revised texts, was eventually issued as a fat hardcover, and the whole series was then re-issued in individual paperbacks. In either edition, they were bare-bones packages, with a brief \\"Note on the Text\\" and unfamiliar vocabulary glossed at the foot of the page. The short introductions by the volume editors were often quite good; in the case of \\"The Tempest\\" (1959, revised 1970), it consists of eleven pages by the distinguished critic Northrop Frye, still valuable as a summary of his ideas on literary modes and genres.<br /><br />There is now a \\"Second Series\\" or NEW \\"Pelican Shakespeare,\\" under the Penguin imprint, with Stephen Orgel and A.R. Braunmuller as General Editiors, issued in the early years of the present century. It is in the larger trade paperback format now commonly used by Penguin. They otherwise retain the basic structure of Publisher's Note, the General Editors on \\"The Theatrical World\\" and \\"The Texts of Shakespeare,\\" an introduction by the volume editor, a Note on the Text,\\" and the text with vocabulary footnotes (embracing slightly more complicated issues, such as puns).<br /><br />There is yet another possible source of confusion, a completely independent \\"Penguin Shakespeare\\" series, apparently issued mainly in the U.K., and much more elaborate (closer in format to the American Signet Shakespeare and recent Folger Library editions).<br /><br />Although standard practices in editing Shakespeare changed over the almost fifty years separating the initiations of the two Pelican series, these changes are of remarkably little relevance to \\"The Tempest,\\" which appeared in the First Folio, and only the First Folio, and in a fairly clean text to boot. Major issues (outside speculations that we have a heavily revised or cut version of the play) are problems in assigning prose passages to the intended speakers, and occasional metrical passages embedded in prose passages. (These theories are in part related to whether information on the performance of the play in 1611 indicates its first production.)<br /><br />Such problems are most acute in the actual storm of the title, Act One, Scene One, in which the Master of a ship, the Boatswain, assorted members of the crew, and some fairly useless courtiers are all talking at once. As a stage direction in the Folio describes offstage cries for help, \\"a confused noise.\\" Only one personality stands out, the wise old councillor, Gonzalo, mostly for his remarkably calm preaching at fellow-courtiers and seamen alike (and so continues throughout the play).<br /><br />Here and elsewhere, Frye's text occasionally \\"corrects\\" some of the Folio's stage directions -- which are insufficient by modern standards, and often confusingly placed -- and normalizes the spelling (the Pelican practice), but is otherwise comfortingly unremarkable, with no effort to make Shakespeare say what he ought to have said, instead of what the sixteenth and seventeenth-century texts in fact say. It remains readable, and useful -- but don't think that you are getting the benefit of more recent scholarship on the play, or of, for example, a better knowledge of theatrical conditions around 1611.akespeare and recent Folger Library editions).<br /><br />Although standard practices in editing Shakespeare changed over the almost fifty years separating the initiations of the two Pelican series, these changes are of remarkably little relevance to \\"The Tempest,\\" which appeared in the First Folio, and only the First Folio, and in a fairly clean text to boot.

B007TXN4TK|3.0|Piano Master is for those of us who are &#34;all thumbs&#34; when trying to play piano.  It will allow you to play in a slow mode until you can learn to master the keys and then you can switch to faster modes.  It is fun and again, if you cannot play piano at all or just are not adept to it this will help you to learn.  The downfall, of course, is that it's really too hard to try and play with 2 hands - it's more of a one finger deal, but, fun nonetheless.

B007TBZ63Y|2.0|After loving books 1 and 2, my son found book 3 bizarrely disjointed. We wondered whether we had missed a book in the sequence. He lost interest after a few chapters.<br />It reads more like a screenplay, with dialogue ending mid sentence, and a narrative that flashes between scenes. I wonder if that's indeed how it was intended.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Ok so this book gives tablets a hard time and if you get it you'll understand what im saying<br />This book is all about seven demigods trying to defeat the evil earth god geae<br />But be warned this book will leave you hanging in the end but its woeth it<br />But all the more reason to get it
B00448SE4S|5.0|I was disappointed I never got to see this in theaters, but it's a very good film. As a fan of the comics, I really enjoyed the style of this film. Wallace Wells is still my favorite character.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|One of the best animsal movies ever.Richard Gere was awesome.Based on a true story and it was very moving.A must see if you have a dog or just like dogs.I`d recommend it for children and adults as well.
B00785P2QC|5.0|really fun and really interesting. I liked it because of the freedom to build thing but somethings are really expensive.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I am a college student and downloaded this app to help me figure out how to bundle up this winter on a morning to morning bases. The app has troubles updating. For example the temperature I saw was last updated at 5 in the morning and I was looking at it at 7 or 8. It also does not have a single day function. You can only view hour by hour or the 10 day forecast.<br /><br />The 10 day forecast feature is nice. You can get a general overview for the week if you want. Just not that great for play by play temperatures.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think that this app is fairly good and that you should buy it the only problem is that I cant update the app

B003YL4LYI|5.0|this part of the story is what you've been dying to read throughout the 4th book, which is good but gives more of the side tales.  fun and exciting to read...wish i could have some dornish wine
1451695187|5.0|I'm not an avid reader of books.  I can and do read online all day long, however.<br /><br />This book is terrific!  It's well-written and very enlightening on Eben Alexander's NDE.  Since he is a medical doctor and scientist, he gives an educated view and most of all description of what he experienced.  It's a book written of hope, love and compassion.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Very good app. Did and performed to what I needed it for. Recommend this for anyone looking for file explorer.
1451627297|5.0|Why read: I'm reading all of Stephen King's books.<br /><br />What impressed me: This is one of Stephen King's very best non-horror titles. So very, very long, but every page necessary - which is not always the case with King's super lengthy titles. You really care about Jake while getting to know him and his motivations deeply. The history feels solid (from someone who isn't a huge history buff) and is completely fascinating. Everything about this book is totally perfect.<br /><br />What disappointed me: Absolutely nothing.<br /><br />Recommended: Very highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game rocks! I have played it before at a friends house. love it! you should get this app even if it is expensive.
006207377X|4.0|Why read: I'm reading all of Christie's mysteries.<br /><br />What impressed me: This book was crazy. The story felt a little dated, but the plots twists were better than most modern books and movies. Things were very unexpected and continued to get crazier to the very end.<br /><br />What disappointed me: The only real problem with this book was that is was a little difficult to get into, given the not so interesting victim. A dentist? Sort of boring. The story eventually made up for it, but I could see many people giving up on it before getting to the more exciting parts.<br /><br />Recommended: Yes, a decent, not as well known, Agatha Christie mystery.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I have followed the Deftones for many years and every new album i have had the pleasure of listening to has been a delight and revelation to my ears. Koi No Yokan is definitely no exception. It instantly gripped me and took me for a roller coaster ride which i am still coming down from 3 days later. Deftones have evolved and now is their time.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I believe the book could have been better but in the end it was a good book I recommend you read
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really enjoy this free game on Kindle Fire.  Can change the number of cards exposed in the deck form 3 to one or back again.  So easy to move the cards around.  Good way to pass the time.
B0085E3M26|5.0|I liked Haley on season 10 of American Idol, but always accepted the fact that she came in third behind Scotty McCreery and Lauren Alaina.  Now I'm not so sure!!  This album is incredible.  The melodies mix jazz, blues and tempo variations that are amazing.  Haley, who contributed to the writing of every song except one, pulls you into every single lyric.  Even when just listening, you can see her smile and emotions shining through.  I really think this is going to be a breakout album for her.  You can tell that a tremendous amount of work went into every cut.  When I played the album the first time, I read the lyrics (in the digital booklet) as I played each song.  The lyrics are thoughtful, playful, and mesmerizing all at once.  Like a book you can't put down, I couldn't stop until I had finished listening to every song.  If you liked Haley a little on Idol Season 10, you will love this album!  I liked it so much it inspired to download all of the Season 10 performances Haley did.  The duets with Casey Abrams are especially good.  This work represents a fantastic debut, and I hope this first album propels Haley to stardom.  I really believe Listen Up is worthy of a Grammy.  Haley might get best new artist.  IT REALLY IS THAT GOOD!  I would recommend to anyone that they at least give Listen UP a try by previewing each and every song!  The Deluxe Version is a little pricey, but the four extra songs are worth every penny,
0670026182|5.0|I have been a fan of What Katie Ate for the past year or so, since a friend recommended the blog to me. From the first time I laid eyes of Katie's amazing photographs and recipes, I knew it would only be a matter of time before she was asked to write a book, and this incredible tome doesn't disappoint! In fact, I would go as far as to say that it's one of the loveliest and most impressive cookbooks I have ever seen.<br /><br />Katie Quinn Davies not only wrote the majority of the recipes in the book (there are also a handful of recipes from friends and family members), but she also styled and photographed every shot, and even designed the book herself (apparently she used to be a graphic designer). The result is an impossibly beautiful and lovingly put together book that will delight existing followers of her blog, and mesmerise anyone new to her work.<br /><br />Aside from the lush photography and gorgeous design, the recipes themselves are wonderful. I have already made several dishes from the book, including a number of salads, the fish pie, the beef and Guinness pie, the homemade baked beans and the super-simple raspberry friands. Every dish has turned out perfectly, and most have ended up tasting even better than I was expecting!<br /><br />Katie's style of food is probably best described as 'simple, yet sophisticated home cooking' and while many of these dishes are perfect for whipping up any day of the week, most of them would also greatly impress at a dinner party. It's rare to find a cookbook where every recipe appeals, but this is one cookbook that manages just that - a testament to Katie's amazing multiple talents.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to any lover of good food and beautiful photography and design!!
B001N3GUIE|5.0|Great to have a favorite movie in my collection at long last.  Enjoy the extras.  Made an afternoon of ironing  a real pleasure.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season is everything I wanted. A Brutal and unforgiving apocalypse. Loving every minute of it.  Can not believe what has happened.
B0070Y46UY|3.0|I realize that survival is a personal journey that brings one closer to God as your life stands on the brink of ending; but in the Life of Pi, the story gets bogged down in the many ways of eating raw fish and sea turtles.  There is a constant struggle between the human, Pi, and other species to survive, with one predator eating another. After a while, you care little for the story.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I love these movies ecspecially the first 2 there is no better science fiction than alien.  The set that these came in is very nice and quality.  I cant wait to go through all the special features yet as I just have not had the chance yet but am looking forward to it. Everything about this was a great deal especially getting it for 20 bucks on a gold box deal!  If your at all a fan of the alien series get this today!
078322947X|5.0|This is a great film. Please don't let the quibbles about DVD conversion discourage you from buying it. Unless you are a cinephile, you will not notice anything wrong with the conversion.<br /><br />And while I appreciated \\"The Wages of Fear\\", I actually liked this film better because of the atmospherics possible with more advanced technology like rain machines, zoom lenses, stereo, color, Tangerine Dream, etc.<br /><br />\\"Wages\\" is powerful and justifiably famous but it is so insistently nihilistic that it lacked subtlety for me. Just my totally subjective and non-cinephilic opinion.
B008G33OJM|1.0|This item did not work in my Sony BD player nor my Panasonic BD player nor in a Dell Windows 7 professional computer.<br />Amazon was very quick in sending me another.  The new one showed the same symptoms as the original one.<br /><br />It showed the usual warning in German.  It showed the title of the disc and the company that makes it and played a musical chord.  Then it just stopped and did nothing for five<br />minutes or so.  Anyone out there have any ideas?<br />Thanks

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly Clarkson is back with a stellar album which contains no fillers, that's why i gave it 5/5 stars. There is not any track on this album I skip as the production is great and generally the songs are fantastic, catchy but with smart lyrics. I really feel there is quite a country style twist to this album and it is interesting and different as a result (\\"Breaking You Own Heart\\", \\"The Sun Will Rise\\").<br /><br />The album has everything and i'm sure it will satisfy every listener. It is definitely one of her best albums if not the best (\\"Breakaway\\" is often labelled as her best work but i totally believe \\"Stronger\\" has topped it) and a massive improvement compared to her previous pop-oriented \\"All I Ever Wanted\\" album.<br />Kelly remains the best American Idol after a decade and this album proves it.<br /><br />PS: The booklet includes the lyrics of the songs (so i suggest you to buy the physical edition) and in general i love the artwork!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|I'm not sure what all the bad reviews are about, but I honestly couldn't understand the difficulty behind this. You clip on the nyko zoom mechanism onto the connect, line up the lenses, and play away. I didn't even read the instructions. The nyko zoom does exactly what its intended to do, and that is to allow people with minimal space to play kinect games at least in the \\"good\\" range for space requirements, at least thats how it is for me with the small (5-6 ft) space between my bed footboard and my kinect. Clip on the device, line up the lens, and simply turn on your xbox. Any problem you experience is YOUR OWN FAULT. Obviously, things like this should have a minimum IQ allowed -_-
B00723NWJE|5.0|\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is Norah's 5th studio album and her most personal to date. The album is produced by Brian Burton (Danger Mouse) who is notable for his production work with The Black Keys and Gnarls Barkley.<br /><br />Some fans might not like it because it is very different than anything Jones has ever done before but that shows that she's a risk-taker and a true artist who wants to try all kinds of music and expresses herself through music.<br />That's what i love about artists and Norah is not the exception.<br /><br />\\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is dark, moody and bitter in content that captivated me from first to last track. The album tells a story about a break-up and our heroine feels betrayed by her ex-boyfriend (\\"Take it Back\\"), but she \\"would like to see him happy\\" (She's 22) even with his new girlfriend, while she is willing to \\"take the life\\" of \\"Miriam\\" (the person behind the break-up of Norah & her boyfriend) . I dare to say that this is on par with Adele's \\"21\\" but Norah's sound is too risky for the general public.<br /><br />Overall, i think this is a great and extremely interesting album with smart lyrics. Danger Mouse did an amazing job in the production once again (I love \\"Rome\\" and \\"El Camino\\"), while Norah delivered another masterpiece album. I really can't wait to hear the next album considering she's keeps getting better with each album.<br /><br />Standout tracks: Happy Pills, Take it Back, Miriam, Out on the Road, Say Goodbye<br /><br />Once again, thank you Norah for the story.
B0041KVZ18|4.0|We all know the songs here so I will just say the Music on this vinyl release sounds very good. Maybe in headphones you can hear the changes better. The album jacket has the four pictures of John. Paul, George, Ringo inside and the poster with all the words in dark ink this time. The vinyl is 180g. The noise on my copy was at the start of Back In The USSR. After the sound of the jet fading for two seconds there is scratch sound but no skip. And the same thing on the other side of the start of Martha My Dear. There is still a little noise on this new record in places. Not a clean pressing of this batch. The better the sytem the better your sound will be. So many great songs with so many styles of sound. People that grew up listing to this album understand it. First timers might not like some of the songs. I wouldn't change any of the songs. Its The White Album good or bad to some. These releases are not numbered like the first release in 68. Its a chance to own a new clear copy of The Beatles, White Album on vinyl again.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|Honestly if this had only included the original Blu-ray Discs this would have still been a great set, but all the extras that are included make this a must have for any LOST fan. Secret messages, a replica of Jacob's board game, and a hidden secret are just a few of the awesome surprises you'll find.

0061730335|5.0|This book is so inspirational, to see this young boy so determined to make his & his family's life better.  American school children should read this to see how important an education is.......we are spoiled by all we have right at our fingertips....& our public schools are free, unlike William's.  Although he struggled with English & reading, he was going to improve things in his village no matter what........very culturally interesting too.
B009AZZEU2|3.0|Agree with those who honestly assess this as the band's weakest effort.  Overall, not as melodic, powerful or packing memorable songs as past albums.  Some decent tracks, but generally uneven and a bit disjointed.  It's ok, but if I want to rock ill put on the old stuff.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Excellent app.  Very useful  and user friendly.  I use it daily for reading, study, and listening when I am on the go

B009Y6V7XK|4.0|Honestly, I bought this sight unseen... or ummm, sound unheard. Even though I only like certain COF songs I love the atmosphere they project. I'm sure this will have some gems just like every other album. Listening as I type. If you're a COF fan just buy it. It's the right thing to do.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book. Def keeps you going until the very end. Totally reccomend any of Gillian's books to anyone to read.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The racketeer is a  totally  unrealistic fun read. Fun trying to determine which direction story will go.  This book is a little different from Grisham's other's.
0307949486|5.0|I have read the complete trilogy, and I think that \\"THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO\\" was just as well-written as the others.  I especially liked the characterization in the books.  There was also just enough \\"fantasy\\" to make it interesting.  A really good read!
0439023513|3.0|While loving book 1 and book 2, Book 3 left me disappointed.  It does provide closure, however it seems to waiver, or muddle through the story line.  Katniss, the strong heroin - changes is the best way to put it.  To me, it seems that Collins was lost for an ending and ended up getting too tied up in the details to write a steallr conclusion to an epic series.<br /><br />You'll be left looking for more out of some charcters adn too much out of others.  The problem is it is a must read to finish up the story line.
0930289234|5.0|I paid a third of the price here than I would have in my local shop.<br />And I agree that Watchmen is one of the greatest graphic novels of ALL TIME.
B0029QRA1U|4.0|I only put it 4 stars due the capsule quality, it could be better. It's good but could be a little bit better.<br />The other features are great. I converted some old vinyls on mp3 and they resulted great.<br />I indicate it for anyone who loves the vinyl sound and vibe.
B007HJ98XC|5.0|I avoided watching it until a coworker told me about it. I couldn't stop watching it after the first Ep. and finished the 1st season in one day. It keeps you guessing and you don't know who will survive the season. AWESOME SHOW!!!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|After trying the free version of several MSoft Office compatible Android apps, I settled on Document To Go for my Fire because the user interface was the most intuitive and easiest to use.  As soon as Amazon ships the Kindle HD, I'll be adding Documents To Go full version, and we'll see how well it works with a keyboard attached to the Kindle!
1454701250|5.0|Geninne Zlatkis does a wonderful job explaining the techniques required to carve your own rubber stamps.

The book is visually appealing and very informative, I would recommend anyone interested in this type of craft to purchase this book.
B007XNAQ6A|5.0|THe sound on this CD is great and the music selection is top notch.  While they should have included a few more tunes that are on the live concert version Blu-ray, there's no complaints with the overall quality of this compilation.
B002MUAJ2A|5.0|Great book. Very concise and non-BS. Interesting take on many aspects of productivity and running a business. I'm absolutely in love with it.
B009KHBDUU|3.0|My wife and I wanted to see this when it came out in theaters.  We never had the chance to go and instead decided to stream it on Amazon.  We were disappointed.  We both like Burton and Depp, but the movie seemed to be lacking.  No spoilers here, but it ends rather abruptly and there's really no build up to justify the ending.
B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic for the People by far is one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  Every song fits, with no filler.  It is hard for me to pick a favorite song but if I had to it would be Find The River.  Not to sound morbid, but I want that song played at my celebration of life, for it talks about returning to the sea.<br /><br />The river to the ocean goes,<br />A fortune for the undertow<br />None of this is going my way<br />There is nothing left to throw<br />Of ginger, lemon, indigo,<br />Coriander stem and rows of hay<br />Strength and courage overrides<br />The privileged and weary eyes<br />Of river poet search naivete<br />Pick up here and chase the ride<br />The river empties to the tide<br />All of this is coming your way<br /><br />After this album they did Monster, which was harder and more rocky.  Not to say that Monster was a bad album and really it is hard to pick a bad album in their catalog, though I was never partial to Reveal.<br /><br />Hopefully Automatic For The People doesn't get lost to time, for it is truely timeless.  I will most certainly be happy when my kids discover it, or if they don't I will suggest they listen to it.<br /><br />Thank you R.E.M. for the music and especially for this masterpiece.<br /><br />Peace

0156027321|5.0|If you were stranded on a small boat in the ocean with a large dangerous tiger, what would you do? I would try to trick it into jumping into the water by scaring it. But in this particular novel, we follow a young man who's in this predicament, and we learn of his troubles, beliefs, and hope of survival. It also takes \\"man vs animal\\" in a very different way.<br /><br />In the novel, we follow Pi Patal on his journey in life in the late 70s. In the beginning, we learn much about him like his family's zoo, his religious beliefs, and his early days as a child. Later in the story, the family has sold their zoo and animals and are leaving Pondicherry for Canada. On a large cargo ship called Tsimtsum, Pi await to see his new life.<br /><br />But an unexpected storm/shipwreck causes Pi to go overboard, and manages to escape in a lifeboat and joining him includes a hyena, giraffe, orangutan and a 450 lb. Bengal Tiger named Richard Parker. As one by one, the three animals fight each other for food, Pi and RP are the only two inboard. When the days turn into weeks and beyond, Pi will do everything to survive on this path. Meanwhile, his relationship with Richard Parker evolves over time and changes both their lives.<br /><br />This novel won me over the first time when I read it back last year, and it will over anyone. Pi Patel is one very convincing character and he tells his story with true honesty and imagery. We get a novel full of drama and adventure, but readers will definitely be more interested in the relationship between Pi and RP, which is both unforgettable and unexpected. I can't wait to see the film, and hope that it captures the creativity of this wonderful novel (A).

0316743305|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the book - in fact I read it cover to cover in one sitting - it interested me so much!<br />I think research and development labs really need to be funded before they all disappear.  Remember Bell Labs that gave us the transistor (and hence, all the follow on microprocessors)?  Who is left to do the real research?  Without funding, our technology will fall behind, and that is not where I want to see this nation!

159420411X|2.0|I have had many statistics courses in my life and have read several books that attempt to bring statistics to the common man. Let me first start by saying that the best book I have ever read that brings statistics down to a level that most people can understand is Struck By Lightning. It is a wonderful read and is everything that Nate Silver's book is not. I will start out with the good parts of this book, because there are a couple:<br /><br />1) The chapter on chess and the matches of Kasparov vs. Big Blue was very informative. It was not informative in a statistical way, but more in a historical way. Very interesting how all of that unfolded and this could have been a small book itself.<br /><br />2) The chapter on earthquakes was interesting in that it discusses why earthquakes are so difficult to predict. It also gave some nice history on attempted earthquake prediction.<br /><br />Now for the problems with this book, and there are many:<br /><br />1) It is written in a sloppy, \\"youth-friendly\\" way that attempts to appeal to too many people. There are too many attempts at humor that fall flat and way too much slang and dumbed-down terminology. Example of trying to appeal to too many people: \\"Skynet was the evil computer in the Terminator series. It gets very mad when you confuse it with HAL 9000.\\" Oh boy. I thought this book was about statistics, not about how to make a bad pun.<br /><br />2) Silver interjects his opinion too much. Just read the chapter on global warming. It is a sickening chapter that nearly discredits everything else he wrote. He doesn't hide how liberal he is (throughout the book) and this chapter just shows how he blindly follows the liberal orthodoxy hook, line, and sinker. If Silver doesn't understand the massive problems with the global warming \\"consensus\\" then he is no expert in statistics. Repeat after me Nate Silver: The Earth did not warm at all over the last decade and the planet has warmed and cooled thousands of times throughout its history.<br /><br />3) He spends a lot of time on the financial meltdown of 2008 and 2009 but he doesn't really understand what happened and why it happened. He takes the popular and easy notion that financial instruments were the cause rather than a symptom of the underlying problem. I was in the industry at the time and I am a Chartered Financial Analyst with an M.A. in Economics. I have a thorough understanding of what went wrong during this time and I can justifiably say that Silver walked into territory he should not have.<br /><br />4) He just isn't a very good writer. Writing isn't easy and very few people can write really well. He just doesn't have the gift and the book is written more like a compilation of casual blog pieces.<br /><br />Probably the most irritating thing about this book is his opinionated way of writing. When I watch the news I don't want Fox News and their biased opinion. I don't want MSNBC either. When I read books about history or statistics, I don't want the author's opinion. I want facts and I will form my opinion myself.

B008RZF1UO|5.0|The departure of Roy Khan from North America's Kamelot could easily have heralded their demise. After fronting the band for over a decade - his voice integral to their signature sound and his persona a large part of their identity - the void left by Khan's vacancy was enormous. Not surprisingly however, Kamelot has never been about one man - or one man's ideas for that matter - and so they picked up the pieces, found the tremendously talented singer Tommy Karevik (Seventh Wonder) and with the help of long-time producer Sascha Paeth, they moved on. To say that Silverthorn is a triumph would be an understatement for the end result here is superior to their past two releases in every capacity. And while perhaps not as majestic as the Epica/The Black Halo tandem, Silverthorn stands alone as an excellent piece of art. And not only is this a victory on the musical side, the packaging, presentation and concept are first rate.<br /><br />The Limited Edition set comes in a nice heavy cardboard box which contains a 48 page hard bound booklet with heavy quality paper and wonderful illustrations. The book chronicles the story behind the music - a compelling tragedy about the death of a young girl and the aftermath for her twin brothers and family. The story is told in \\"first person\\" by one of the brothers as he is forced to deal with the secret behind her death and the consequences of his and his brother's ill-fated choices. Well-written, the story sets the stage for this epic musical journey - one which could easily continue on subsequent recordings. Additionally, the box set contains the original recording in a hard bound digibook (beautifully illustrated) with lyrics. There is a separate bonus disc with a full instrumental version of the release (sans main vocals only) and the bonus track \\"Grace.\\" Oddly, the background vocals/spoken parts remain on the instrumental recordings. Finally, in old school fashion, there is a poster of the band. From a graphic design standpoint the box set is another huge victory and will be a must have purchase for fans, especially since the story book is essential in order to truly appreciate the depth of the lyrical content.<br /><br />Musically, the songs are a return to the greatness fans enjoyed with Epica and The Black Halo, and to a lesser degree The Fourth Legacy and Karma - the speedy orchestral rockers (\\"Sacrimony\\" and \\"Torn\\") blended with emotive ballads (\\"Song For Jolee\\") and epic progressive compositions like the title track and \\"The Prodigal Son.\\" Stunningly, Karevik sounds just like Roy Khan. Seriously, if you didn't know that Khan had left the band, you would unlikely be able to discern the difference. It's impossible to imagine that he didn't spend countless hours perfecting even Khan's inflections. Youngblood's guitars have regained their supremacy in the mix (something absent on recent work), and Grillo continues to punch out solid rhythms on the drums. Noteworthy is some really expressive key work by Oliver Palotai, assisted by Sascha Paeth. The story references a melody that is played on the cello after each funeral, and it is fascinating to hear this motif wind itself though the album. Then, at the very end of \\"Continuum\\" - the final track - we are treated to the said haunting cello motif in solo. Nice touch. Guest vocalists Alissa White-Gluz (The Agonist), Elise Ryd (Amaranthe) and Amanda Somerville (story author and choir vocals) make valuable contributions along with a whole host of others. The organ and choral elements at the beginning of \\"The Prodigal Son\\" are deeply moving and are just one example of the gift Kamelot has for \\"painting a scene\\" within their music.<br /><br />Truly cinematic in scope, Silverthorn feels like the soundtrack to its own movie, and the way in which the story hangs - along with the absolute stellar quality of the music - this release will surely have fans begging for a sequel.box set is another huge victory and will be a must have purchase for fans, especially since the story book is essential in order to truly appreciate the depth of the lyrical content.<br /><br />Musically, the songs are a return to the greatness fans enjoyed with Epica and The Black Halo, and to a lesser degree The Fourth Legacy and Karma - the speedy orchestral rockers (\\"Sacrimony\\" and \\"Torn\\") blended with emotive ballads (\\"Song For Jolee\\") and epic progressive compositions like the title track and \\"The Prodigal Son.\\" Stunningly, Karevik sounds just like Roy Khan.

B008AK8FHM|3.0|Great topic, but got way too deep into a medical explanation to how this phenomenon occurs. I expected this to be more of a &#34;feel good&#34; scenario, but had to wade through the medical technicalities, which are somewhat complicated.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected. All of the actors were very genuine and the story felt very true. The direction was on point, as was the editing. What can I say? It's great. I'm really glad I bought it. Definitely a keeper.

0345529057|5.0|An obvious must read for those who love the television show. It's way more in depth, and explains a lot of the relationships and history that the show doesn't have room for.
B00A14SQBU|5.0|I have been a fan of Xtina since the days of 'Back to Basics'.  Stripped was good i guess although B2B clearly made up for the immaturity on the album.  Now for Bionic that was my JAM!  Total artistry and good flowing tracks.  I think the problem with that was the fact that many people weren't ready for her to try a new tangent of music.  Same goes for the Film Burlesque, I was a fan of this film as well as the album because it was new and it was classy as well as cleanly put together.  Many think that she has lost her touch or that her personal struggles are preventing her to shine and make a place for herself in the new generation of stars.  As for LOTUS, i was blown away i love all the dance songs and collaborations with her voice co-coaches.  Her voice is better than ever and she does not shout, she is simply hitting musical ranges we all wish we could do.  So in the end people need to get over there problems and let the WOMAN SANG!  Yes SANG not just simply sing for she has a soul and a piece of her voice that carries a little of her with her audience wherever they go.

B0047WJ12K|5.0|Gréât plot and wonderful acting by diCaprio. Does require lot of attention on the part of viewer. Not your typical \\"sit back and relax\\" movie.
0307596885|4.0|A series of simple tales of everyday life with no great drama foretold, but which still draw you into their captivating storyline.<br /><br />Although each story seems to be plausible, the endings are left open for each person to ascribe as they see fit.  In other words there is a great deal of ambiguity to how each of the characters' lives eventually end up.<br /><br />The author uses the train as a mode of transportation to set the background scene for most of the stories as a unifying theme plus a certain amount of despair and hopelessness in almost every case. Each story has some amount of psychological, spiritual, and sexual nature to it without the use of a lot of 4-lettered words to describe the action.<br /><br />Each short story is poignantly told with a certain amount of hopelessness in the manner of predestination reminiscent of some European writers as Jean Paul Sartre. Yet in Ms Munro's stories the reader can supply the ending they choose, as nothing is written in stone except for the helplessness of the main characters to change a predestined plan of some existential force.<br /><br />With the aforementioned precautions noted, I would recommend this fine work of short stories with easily understandable language. Just remember this is not a feel good series of stories although entertaining and evocative of many aspects of human nature.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|Dark City is a film unlike most others. It is strangely compelling, visually extraordinary, and an unbelievably rich experience from beginning to end. A film that has almost been forgotten, it has achieved a well earned cult status. In Dark City, a man struggles with memories of his past, including a wife he cannot remember, in a nightmarish world with no sun and run by beings with telekinetic powers who seek the souls of humans. Dark City is the finest film of its decade, one of the best of its genre, and one of the greatest ever made.<br /><br />The style is pitch-perfect. Dark City is Laura meets Metropolis, Blade Runner meets M, or even The Cabinet Of Dr. Caligari meets Night And The City. Fritz Lang proposed a challenge with his astonishing 1927 opus Metropolis. Dark City has accepted the challenge, has risen to the occasion, and succeeds in every imaginable way. To view Dark City as Metropolis' offspring is not a bad way of viewing this picture. Dark City takes the best visual elements of Metropolis and builds upon them. Its as if Alex Proyas understood exactly what it was that made Metropolis tick, and channeled the same artistic ambition seventy years later. I still can't believe it took seventy years for another science fiction film to pass the bar set by Metropolis, but I'm happy it finally happened.<br /><br />Dark City can accurately be classified as Neo-Expressionism, and the ways in which it echoes films like Metropolis, M, Mabuse, Pandora's Box, and Caligari are unmistakable. This borrowed style never feels old, if anything it feels fresh and unexplored. The city itself looks amazing, and the lighting is exquisite. This is a city I can look at for hours, and notice more and more detail the more I watch the film. Also, Dark City never feels like an homage to days past, in fact it feels raw, uninhibited, new, and one-of-a-kind. German Expressionism and Surrealism quite frequently lend themselves to the imagination of the filmmakers. And in the end, taking Expressionism as a jumping board is one thing, but to pull it off so well is another, as it takes a great deal of imagination and creativity to be fully realized. I am still taken aback by the creative wonder and virtuosity of the filmmakers, especially Alex Proyas, and how they so efficiently created a world so vivid in a visual style so difficult to manage. The end result is an artistry that rises above that of Lang or Wiene. I am truly astonished by this film. German Expressionism in film is constantly undergoing re-examination and scrutiny, but is seldom re-imagined. Time and time again the filmmakers give us far more than what is expected of them, and showcase for us a visual wonderland that abides by the laws of a forgotten movement that put visual storytelling on the map. As an audience, we are rarely treated so nicely, and catered to so thoughtfully.<br /><br />The Film Noir touch compliments the Expressionism beautifully. We are reminded of The Night Of The Hunter in a scene in which the hero travels by boat with a twisted and dark city in the background. Unlike other science fiction films that incorporate several aesthetically appealing visual trademarks popularized by Film Noir, Dark City is injecting German Expressionism with the genre, not Science Fiction. I think it adds up to a remarkable result. Adding layers to the visual feast, and allows for far more detail and far more interesting characters. You could say, I suppose, that Dark City features Noir characters in an Expressionist Environment. The man from nowhere, the sexy lounge singer, the lonely detective- they are all products of the Film Noir influence. On the other hand, characters like Keifer Sutherland's mad scientist, and the pale 'Strangers' are rooted deeply in Expressionism.<br /><br />As far as the cast is concerned, I thought everyone was just fantastic, especially Rufus Sewell as the Hero, John Murdoch. I wish he was given better roles after Dark City, he would have been a superb leading man. The empathy he brings to his character here is telling of a truly gifted actor. Jennifer Connelly is wonderful as well as the desexualized film noir heroine. William Hurt as Inspector Frank Bumstead is not only classic Noir but classic Hurt as well. His own personality compliments the character well in this outing, whereas in later efforts, the actor would seem to lose sight of his character and simply be himself. Kiefer Sutherland is absolutely wonderful, and reminds me personally of Dwight Frye's portrayal of Renfeild in Tod Browning's Dracula. Sutherland says he was inspired by Peter Lorre's performance as the child murderer in M, and that can be seen very easily. Richard O'Brien of Rocky Horror fame appears as one of the 'Strangers', and turns in very solid performance as Mr. Hand, by far the most interesting of the villains.<br /><br />I love this movie. LOVE IT. This film inspires me to be creative, and to believe in an idea no matter how nonsensical or weird it may seem to other people. This is one of the few cult films that can really stand on its own, and be perfectly fine without a legion of followers giving it street cred. If you have never seen this movie before, do yourself a favor and watch it. I could not recommend it in a higher regard.<br /><br />The blu ray is wonderful. Both theatrical and director's cuts are worth watching. Lovely commentaries by Roger Ebert. Great insight.
0240815807|5.0|A very informative, thorough book. I read a review of it in TapeOp Magazine, I trust them for professional and amateur audio information.
1419705849|4.0|I'll TRY NOT to spoil the book, can't say I won't, I'll just give my honest opinion. I think this is one of the better books in the series. I like this one because it's funny in some parts and I can relate to some of it. There's a cliffhanger at the end, and the ending didn't seem clear enough, like why did Greg have a week off from school? The plot of the Valentine's dance doesn't come until the middle of the book, so don't be surprised.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|5 Stars all the way! :) The only problem I have is deciding who is my favorite. Just when I was digging Capt. A, Iron Man stole his thunder. But The Hulk is an awesome character in his own right.<br /><br />They've gotta get Ant Man going in the next one!
B007EE4XKI|5.0|I really like the Star Trek novels that do the historical route, but in the sense that they use past story lines from TV or other books and intertwine with the new.  Reads very fast, and is the better of the recent Start Trek novels that have come out in awhile.

B000HL09MG|3.0|Maybe I don't appreciate the anxieties of conflicted professionals, but the whole thing played off of conventional stereotypes without really adding anything or even giving it an intriguing spin. Yes, there are levels of meaning, but that mostly depends on kleeshayed portrayals of morality, good/evil, life/death, identity/temptation, etc. Kidman's distress did not strike me as either authentic nor important as motivation, not because of bad acting, but because of an uninspired concept. Cruise is too perfect to represent an everyperson not totally adequate to cope with hard choices, especially in the character of a doctor, but maybe only a doctor could get the manager of a costume shop to open up in the middle of the night. The whole concept of the masks and the exploitation cult could have gone somewhere but mostly provided an excuse for gratifying female nudity. As a threat, it was, like, okay whatever, now let's see those boobs from another angle. Yes, I know, subjugation was partly the point, but in the end, that was about as far as it went. Rape in Clockwork Orange, for instance, takes on new meaning in the context of the ironic social struggle to control violence, even when the rape represents exploitation. What new meaning does the exploitation of women take on in the search for sexual identity? Did the prostitute sacrifice herself to save him from his own insecurity? We don't know, but I doubt prostitutes who look like her would have to work the streets much, even if their lives are as flawed as her domicile. So fragile people with some kind of inner beauty hurt each other until they are driven to hide behind masks for protection, and guess what? Yeah, they can't hide from themselves. Go figure. It all struck me as sort of an extended dramatization of the milk bar scene from Clockwork Orange. I really hoped Kubrick would get beyond that as metaphor or at least energize it somehow, but the title kind of says it all. The irony is just banal and annoying.

B00A3DZ61W|1.0|I think I've seen the same hobbit moviie add every time it does an advertisement,  and that is about every level.  Seen it way too much.  The worst part is it keeps locking up my tablet when the blasted hobbit trailer plays.  Basically,  i play one level,  watch a 2 minute video,  and have to restart the game.  What I've played so far is fun,  it has taken too long though.  Over 10 minutes of game time, and I've only gotten through 6 levels.  Tired of it,  stick with the older ones till this is fixed.  Rovio,  fix your app so it stops locking up,  and get some different add videos.

B0013F1D02|5.0|This movie is so fantastic that no one word can sufficiently sum up the joy it brings to my heart. You know how some movies turn you off from watching it another time because whenever you see it again you're just like, \\"oh man I would watch it again except I absolutely hate this one part of it\\". Well, this movie has no parts like that. I have no qualms against watching it again and again.<br />Everything is perfectly balanced. The romance is kept light, yet important enough to justify its significant influence in the movie's plot. The CGI is well done, as to not completely ruin the immersion of the viewers. Good old action is aplenty in the form of both magical and physical fighting. The script is cohesive and well-written, and there are minimal plot holes (or the charming story discourages you from looking for them). All the events that occur are important, so don't look away for a second.<br />One of the qualities that impresses me the most is that this movie gives off a children friendly vibe, so it's good for a family movie night. However, adults can also watch it and appreciate it in a whole other way. It hides certain adult themes in plain sight so that only those who are seeking can find it. Children will be too caught up by the colorful personalities of our main and minor characters to be the wiser.<br />In all, please watch this movie at least once (or like 5 times). You will enjoy it's lightheartedness,  but also be swept by the simply adorable love story.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was hooked with the first book and had to get the second and then my friend told me the third really summed it up.  It really did and I am sorry there is not a 4th.  But we Kindle readers can wish.  Thank you for having it available for Kindle and I look forward to reading on my Kindle.
B009FB3XTA|4.0|Not sure what all the hate is about in some of these reviews. Sure, this one isn't as good as the first soundtrack from Twilight, but I think it's pretty good. I especially love 'Heart of Stone' by Iko. If you aren't sure, just listen to it for free on Pandora before you buy it.
B00933JL0A|1.0|just downloaded this on my kindle fire and it won't open. don't waste your time on this one! waste of time
B000G75994|5.0|I based my purchase of this set on the reviews and the offered samples.  Upon first listening at home, I was charmed but also annoyed by the delicate touch, as it seemed overly recessive.  Silly me.<br /><br />Not only does her playing style mimic his pianoforte, it adds dimension and sonic balance to what often sounds, on the modern grand piano, like clattering, hammering, clumsy, very uncharacteristic Mozart.<br /><br />I like it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was recommended to me and decided to get it. It is very explicit , more than I usually care for but it is so well written that I continued to read it and am enjoy<br />ing the 2nd book.
B000P0J09W|5.0|hey you guys, this is a great movie. if you havent seen it you owe it to yourself to buy this and watch it multiple times. a timeless classic that is fun for the whole family.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I downloaded this for my Kindle and it works great, I haven't had any problem with this item I would recommend this for anyone.
B001NHNG64|1.0|Save your money.  The story is silly,  Reacher's character is undeveloped,  the other characters are dull and the violence is gratuitous.  I have enjoyed other books in this series,  this one should be skipped
B007FH9GA6|5.0|I unfortunately did not read the book before but after watching this movie straight through with no breaks, I definitely am interested in what's next for my kick azz heroine in between the paperback covers. A few parts are a little squeamish but I absolutely believe in karma and love when the bad guys get their just desserts. I honestly did not know what to expect in this movie and I'm very glad I decided to watch this movie, just mad that I let this one go unwatched this long.  Great actors, wonderful storyline, just want more!!
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|It's alright...no different than any of the other super hero movies.  Yeah, good special effects, the Hulk was cool, but other than that, what's the big deal?
141659521X|5.0|It's hard for me to give anything but 5 stars. What can I say? I love Vince Flynn's books. There is no one else out there like Mitch Rapp, except maybe Allen West. Flynn's books are always good and this one didn't disappoint. Amazon is not getting my business because their prices are ridiculous especially kindle but as far as Vince Flynn is concerned he is the best out there.
B0091V6TF4|3.0|Disc one was good but not crazy about disc two, didn't remember some of the music on two. Will download most of the music on my computer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked the story line and how descriptive it was. I recommend this book to anyone looking for light pleasure reading.
B007IX383I|5.0|What a phenomenal record.  I think it's a watershed moment in this great band's career. I absolutely adore this album.  Recommend strongly.
B000OV85AW|5.0|This movie reminds of a time when TRUE acting was what merited a place on the big screen. Now all you gotta have is big boobs, tight jeans, and good looks. Acting is second on the priority list.<br /><br />Papillon is an adventure and hands down one of the best movies to watch.
B00992CF6W|4.0|this is a great game but they really need to hurry up on the 0.5.0 update. ive been waitng too long for this thing. i mean seriously!
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Simple. Basic. Gets the job done.<br />That is how I would describe this case. It is definitely not flashy but it doesn't need to be. It fits my iPhone very well and so far after months and months of use I have no complaints. The phone still looks very well protected and the case doesn't come apart like some more expensive ones do.
0345803507|5.0|Loved loved loved the third book. Thought it was the best one of them all. Don't get me wrong the first two were good too but that third had more of a plot to it in my opinion
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I am a big fan of Lady Antebellum.  I think the album is fantastic!  Can't believe anyone would be disappointed.
