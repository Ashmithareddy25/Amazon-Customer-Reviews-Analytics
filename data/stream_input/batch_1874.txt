B006LSZECO|1.0|I get the appeal of quirky characters, but these two are just sad and depressing.  I'm glad at least I got it through the library or I would be depressed too.
B009D0LBRO|1.0|its stupied the grafifics are dume u cant. ander stained Tham and were. are there  arms lift  anything they should. make better graffitis. geese
B004S49Z3W|5.0|Read it in the run up to Christmas or on your holidays or any time you need cheering up! I guarantee you will laugh!
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Very good music for anyone! It makes you feel good listening to the songs.  I would share this with all my friends
B00177YA1K|5.0|This movie is a must have for any collection.  It is entertaining no matter how many times you've seen it!
B005DESVPO|5.0|This singer has the best beat to his songs.  He also has a great voice.  It makes you want to get up and dance
B0049IHX2C|5.0|This movie is pure entertainment!  Something in it for every member of the family.<br />One of Wil Smith's very best ever!
0375869026|5.0|This is an outstanding book for young people and adults.  My book club has chosen it to read as a followup to the book No Pity about people with disabilities.  Wonder is told through the eyes of a boy who is going to public school for the first time having survived multiple surgeries to help correct severe facial deformities and cause his face to look as if it is melting.  The story comes from an incident that happened to the author, R.J. Palacio, and it is worth researching this even before reading the book.  I recommend this book for anyone with a heart.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|A lovely book from the perspective of a dog. I'm not a fan of car racing, but found the lessons in story to be completely true. There is much that can be learned from Enzo' s observations of humanity and the human condition. This was a quick and heartwarming read that will have me thinking for quite some time.
B008L1DNGI|4.0|This won't be an award-winning review.  I am a gamer geek and just about made a puddle when I saw this was the FAOTD.<br />Sega Dreamcast was an amazing system and ChuChu Rocket was a big reason I had one.<br />This game is fun, definitely a throw back and recommended for a good time. Unlike the crackhead staring at my doughnut while I type this.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, the previews were great!  Unfortunately, the previews were the best parts of the entire movie.  The movie skipped around a lot and was very violent and yet boring to me.
1451695195|5.0|This book is a MUST-READ for sure.  I couldn't put it down once I had started!  Excellent!  Confirmed what I had suspected for years!
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|excellent. the acting was really, really great.  Tommy  Lee knows how to play a grumpy old man. lol hopefully  more older and younger couples will find it inspiring to keep their marriages fresh
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read the whole thing in like a day and a half. When my mother was doing my hair that is all I do  was read. This  is the first book I read  on my kindle I really like it. I'm torn with the ending because I it is a cliff hanger but I really won't them to be together but I also want katniss to be with Gale.
B0037LXTUW|5.0|I got this for my sister's family who are avid Dixit players. They were determined to stay loyal to the original set of cards - taking the challenge to come up with original captions, but I loved the look of thrilled relief when they opened the new set. It's like polishing your loved comfy shoes!
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This book is the first book that took my mind away. I would recommend this book to all of my directioner friends
1451629184|4.0|Interesting presentation of Jaycee's life experience.  Presented in a way that allowed you to read the difficult experiences without sobbing no-stop.  Amazing young women.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is a fun but challenging bargain teaser. The only reason I rated it so poorly is because on my kindle whenever I play the keyboard pops up and will not go down.
B004I2K4E8|5.0|Great performance.  Highly recommended.  It is one of the best music video that I ever have.  It is worthwhile to be kept in the collection list.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was s good book I guess my favorite part was when he made front of abigale pimple haha bye
B006XF5BTG|4.0|I just finished reading this book. I highly recommend it if you are looking for something to push you to the next level...meaning from Zero  ;-)  It is an easy read and a wealth of knowledge that can be used right away. Some of the things he recommends are new and a little different, but you have to do things differently to get a different result.<br /><br />I even reached out to the author and he responded to me very quickly. Highly recommend it....especially for the price vs content ratio.  ;-)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Great game. Can play it all day. Get is NOW! Don't wait and get it now please. You will love it!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|I love the Boondock Saints, I think if you aren't a huge fan you'll find this one funny but not quite up to par with the first movie. I still very much enjoyed this movie, and have watched it over 100x.
140053271X|5.0|I bought the NOOK for my wife for Christmas, she has not put it down since she got it.  The only thing wrong is I thought I was getting the one with the glow lite and I didn't.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Since the Phantom is my favorite play this rendition was wonderful.  I loved being up close and seeing the actors faces and hearing the lyrics so clearly.  The ending with Andrew Lloyd Webber, Sarah Brightman and all the previous phantoms was a show stopper.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys live theatre brought to your home, excellent....
034544678X|5.0|A must have to any person who have a dog,it's write in a very down to earth language easy to follow and understand...
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Loved the book. I read it very quickly and wanted more but I am unable to find any information as to when another book in this tale is going to be written.. So I wait broken hearted
B000SGRONM|4.0|I have never read any by this author before but have heard about him for years.  With the Christmas season in full swing and a bit overloaded with \\"sweet\\" holiday reads, this seemed the perfect tonic.  A collection of stories that is largely entertaining, I didn't find them to be absolutely hilarious as others have but I did find them interesting and enjoyable.  The first story appears to be the most widely known and relates the experience of working in retail as an elf during the holidays.  Anyone who has worked in the retail industry will appreciate it.  While I enjoyed most of them tremendously, there was one story that turned my stomach and I wish I had skipped it.  The story starts out innocently enough as a parody of the typical, annual Christmas letter distributed by many but it slowly decends into ugly and then takes a turn that was repulsive to me.  I wish it had not been included since it spoiled an otherwise good collection of stories.<br /><br />Definitely worth a read with that one exception.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Really like it so far but I need to put some time into it. So far,So good. Lots and Lots of creative people.
1600595871|5.0|Very nice examples and guidance for making different styles of hand made books.  I do recommend this book for those interested in the topic.
B007OUFESC|5.0|Rented movie so that I could watch it while my daughter was in surgery for several hours. Difficultly getting the movie to start but once that issue resolved itself the movie was great and it helped distract me for a good long time and that is what I wanted.
0316017930|5.0|I have loaned my copy and purchased more copies of this book for many friends. It's a quick, fascinating subject and certainly makes one think. I recommend it!
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|The overall story was a little weak & some of it could have been left out such as the Bane back story. I wasn't quite sure why he felt Gotham needed to be destroyed.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I am addicted to this app.  I love it!  I wish they offered more interesting FREE puzzles but it's great.  My only complaint is that I have puzzles missing.  I think when it updates some of them disappear and that is not cool at all.  When you try to re-download it fails so I don't know.  Many of the puzzles are beautiful and very, very enjoyable.  Highly recommend it!
B000BW7QWW|4.0|What a great cast. Excellent writers. And, on the big screen they pulled out all the stops.<br /><br />Firefly was one of the best TV shows in this generation. If you liked it, get this DVD. If you never saw the TV show, and you like space or action movies, you'll really enjoy this screen adaptation of the show. Very cool -and you can stop it and watch bits over again!
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Wes Anderson creates such magical places that you want to keep going back to!  The cast is perfect, the setting is perfect and the music is fantastic!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This was my first purchase,  I selected this because of my knowledge of Solitaire and I found it very friendely.
B0083Z614S|5.0|I am a Great Grandmother and I still love to read this wonderful book. It is my favorite and I still read it over and over. A classified sure!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|How can you go wrong with Rod Stewart.  This is a great music cd.  I'm still listening and the holiday is over.
B005TQAI6G|2.0|I used to love Britney and her performances but COME ON, this tour and DVD are blatant \\"grab-the-money-and-go\\" clunkers.  She barely seems interested at all and seems to hand-dance in slow motion. She used to be a powerhouse performer (even if she never actually sang) but gone are the wicked-hot dance moves and unshakable confidence. She barely moves her lower body and is in pretty bad shape. The entire production looks cheap, from the costumes to her jacked-up hair extensions.  Sad to see a former superstar just going through the motions (barely) so she can make some more money.  I'm pretty much a former Britney fan at this point.
0307352145|5.0|I haven't finished the book as yet but can unequivocally say this has been a gold mine of information for me. The writing is intelligent and cohesive.Susan Cain has done her research and presented such in a thoughtful and persuasive manner. It has helped me to understand and accept and even treasure aspects of myself that beforehand I came to believe were somehow weaknesses. I've read my share of self help books and have typically come away disappointed. Not this time. I highly recommend this book.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|It's really clever, the graphics are excellent and the interactivity of the goo balls is accurate and fun.  What a fun app to get as the FAOTD!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love playing Solitaire on my new Kindle Fire HD! It has good graphics and response. I would recommend to everyone.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you are looking for something to quench your thirst after reading fifty shades of gray, this is the ultimate book!!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Some bingo games use up so many points that you can not play for very long.  I understand that some of the bingo games are trying to get you to spend money on bingo chips, but I won't do it!  This version allows me to play without using up all my free chips.  Thank you bingo-blitz!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app is awesome and its easy as one little click and it shows me all my posts and you should totally get this app it works great ....I'm very pleased getting this app.
B005FVNIW6|3.0|A good read, intelligent, well developed plot and characters. Ending lets it down, could have done more with the story, a bit too neat of an ending. Despite that, very good read, a real page turner.
B00A0A59IS|5.0|I love one direction. Anyone who loves them as much as I do should buy it. I found that they seemed to mature in their music. I like it a lot also because you can hear their adorable accents quite well. Gotta love 1D!
B0058EBNAO|3.0|eWeather HD - It gives me the local weather, but I can't seem to get it to accept other zip codes.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Facebook is a wonderful way to find friends, family,  and just keep in touch.  Facebook also has become a way to find out what is happening in and around your area.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Everything about this book was perfect. It was greatly written and I would not put it down. The plot kept me attached at all times
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have enjoyed playing this game.  story is interesting and sortable scary. I am very glad it has a zoom for the hidden object part of the puzzles. looking forward to finishing this one.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This book really explained how they feel about everything that has happened. Best book that I have read about them.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|I love Rod Stewart and so the Christmas album is great.  The download was easy and we played the album all through the Christmas season.
0316227706|5.0|Found this under my Christmas tree...wonderful book...huge fan of the photographer, so much fun!  A great gift for all dog lovers.
B00631VJIC|5.0|Husband and I love the show and the music. Ordered for Christmas. Great price! Can't wait to listen to it.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|The incredibly versatile and talented Meryl Streep is wonderful in this moving (and frequently funny) story of a woman yearning for more intimacy in her marriage.  Although her husband may be dour and curmudgeonly to us, in her eyes he shines and she makes it all believable.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Preordered for my daughter for Christmas. Didn't have to try and locate in stores and actually got it for less than originally ordered for!
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Funny, snarky, sometimes crude, Moran speaks truth to power in a way that drives realities home while leaving you in tears of laughter.  It was the go to item on my gift list this holiday season.
B000TEUSJA|4.0|I bought this because someone said it was a great movie. I watched it and was a bit surprised by how x-rated it was.I think it was popular because of all the nudity because the story was not easy to follow.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I had never heard of RED until my son told me how awesome it is. So I took a chance and purchased it. It has turned into one of our family favorites. I haven't met anyone who doesn't love it. Funny, but also, one of the best filmed action scenes ever!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|After reading all the positive reviews I purchased \\"Hopeless\\" and in the beginning it was obvious that this is a VERY well written novel. I thought, 'Óh yes it will be a really NICE story' BUT then it changed unexpectedly and turned out to be a FANTASTIC novel. I couldn't put it down. Beautifully written, which made it a delight to read. Well done Colleen, I can't wait to read more of your work!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|If you are into superheroes movies this is the one to watch! I would recommend watching some of the prior movies like Ironman first for more character background.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|BOUGHT THIS AS CHRISTMAS GIFT AND IT WAS SENT VERY FAST .<br />MY SOON TO BE SON IN LAW WAS THRILLED WITH IT.
B008CPZNL6|2.0|why am I required to use a twitter account just to bookmark an article? there  other readers that don't require the forced sharing.
B008ELUEQC|1.0|Lost in the mail still waiting as of 12/27/2012 at 11:50:00 AM Mail has not come yet today. I guess I will wait.
B008ELUEQC|4.0|Should please anyone who already likes Rod Stewart's raspy voice. One piece with a line something like &#34;A Way In A Manger&#34; has a real engaging melody and a unique small twist to familiar words that expands the basic message of the song.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Very good game with lots stages that challenge my brain to get so much better than it was before I started playing
B0076DELIG|3.0|I just finished this book and was a bit disappointed - with the ending, especially.  It is vintage Bosch, always pushing against the grain and risking his career in order to do what is right for the victim.  In this instance, it meant going back to the days before and after the Rodney King riots in order to solve a 20-year-old murder.  Things clicked into place slowly and although the plot development was good, the relationships between characters fell a bit flat - especially between Harry and Maddy, Harry and his latest lady and between Harry and his partner.  Is Connelly still writing just to bring in the moolah, or is it time for him to retire Harry and find another hero?
B005Q1W10A|5.0|this is one of the best series on T.V. I can hardly wait for Season 3 to begin in Jan.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I love these series and I can easily say that this was one of the best books yet. Lots of laughs!
B00004Y6NT|5.0|Words can't do justice to this album. I own all of their albuns and I have to say that their first three albuns are the best, but communiqué stands above. I get very pissed off with the fact that this great album is so underrated. I also don't understand why some say that communiqué has a very similar set of songs of their first album. Give this album a listen and you'll perceive that this statement makes no sense. It has a very different mood, and is quite a bit more focused. The guitar work is outstanding. Single Handed Sailor is surely the best guitar work I have ever heard, and I own more than 500 CDs... All the songs here are great. Give this album a chance, you won't regret. Let's do some justice to this underrated gem.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Martel spins a yarn of his own ordinary life as a zookeeper's son unvicariously coalaced with the truth of another man's misadventure at sea. The first half of the book seems unrelated but clearly unravels as you read your way through the second. From background as a God loving Hindi, Christian Muslim born and raised in a French Province of India, now living in Montreal, Canada, Yann Martel blends words and fuses cultures.<br /><br />Martel presents the reader with a plausible and lovable protagonist, Pi. Yann Martel Uses words I have never used to describe things I have never experienced, being lost at sea in the Pacific on a life boat for 227 days with Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger.  When you watch this story unfold you will soon realize, no one could make this up or could they? I am still reading the Life of Pi.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Wow, I can't believe the deal on this one (got it on a lightening deal for $2)! Such a great film. The ultraviolet format comes as a code, and we have not tried to use this yet. Others have said this doesn't work that well, I can't speak to that, but the DVD is wonderful, and that is why I purchased this copy.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've played  this game on PC, and it's great! Transition to touch screen using my Kindle Fire HD wasn't hard at all. Great game if you like to figure out puzzles.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is an awesome game I could play it for hours i love it! I have this hale on my wii and I almost like this version better!
B001706I5I|4.0|You could turn the sound off at times and just watch Jim Carey's face for laughs.  This is a perfect role for him...and a great holiday film for the family to watch....escpecialy for those who read Dr. Suess to their kids.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|these two actors are so good together -watch them portray their characters so effortlessly. the story was interesting and enjoyable. The ending was perfect as well.
0763644455|3.0|The amazing story of Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson is about an adventurous<br />treasure hunt. A young boy named Jim, a doctor, and a squire, find a map to an island with<br />treasure. They gathered a crew, cast off and \\"the Hispaniola had begun her voyage to the Isle of<br />Treasure.\\" But the crew is not what it appears to be, and Jim, the doctor, the squire, and a few<br />close people must abandon ship, fight off these now pirates, and find the treasure alone.<br /><br />Treasure Island follows the journey of Jim. He is a curious young boy who is not afraid<br />of death.  He is also very smart which allows him to come up with amazing plans, but often they<br />led him to near death experiences. Jim narrates Treasure Island along with the doctor who narrates only a<br />few chapters to help explain the story.<br /><br />This story takes place in 18th century England and on the island known as the \\"Isle of<br />Treasure.\\" Due to the period it is set in, there is some historical fiction (the boats, guns, buildings,<br />etc.), but the story is more of an adventure; there is exploring, death, and of course, treasure<br />hunting.<br /><br />Robert Louis Stevenson purposely wrote Treasure Island to be an easy read, but the old<br />English dialogue (due to the time it was written) adds a nice challenge for readers. He gives you<br />the right amount of detail to get the picture he is trying to describe. You know the story is going<br />to have a favorable ending for Jim, but his details make it easy to get lost in the story that you forget that. Many a<br />time I was doubtful of the outcome. One of my favorite books, the Hunger Games, is just like<br />this.<br /><br />Treasure Island is a good book. It grabbed my attention and I had many late nights<br />reading it, however, I would not say that it is a great book. The simple wording does make the<br />book an easy read, but at the same time it does not drag you into the story.<br /><br />Treasure Island is a good book, not great. I would recommend everyone to read this if<br />they are looking for an easy, quick read. I would read Treasure Island again and give it three and<br />a half stars.
1476715904|5.0|I read Slammed and the follow-up Point of Retreat in just 2 days because I just couldn't put them down!  Both quick, easy reads that I just want more of!  They are both books about love and loss and it reminds you what it felt like when you first fell in love with \\"the one\\".  You can't help but fall in love with every single one of the characters and I like that Colleen Hoover switched the books up with Slammed being narrated by Lake and Point of Retreat by Will.  So good....so, so good!
B0015DRPJU|5.0|Finally the lovers get together only to be torn apart less then two days later......So sad and spellbinding, I just kept reading because I had to know what happens next.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very fun game. You won't want to put it down. I can play this game for hours.  Keeps you strateging.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I like the graphics and waited for this to come out for my Fire. I'm sure it will keep me busy for a while. No complaints.
B009AZZ6H8|5.0|husband had to have it, we're now listening to it in the car and it's great<br />a must have !!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|A very handy app that tells you when to recharge and how much juice you have left on your Kindle.<br />Cheap and handy.<br />Recommended.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Just got done reading this book. The information in this book is great for starting out. What I've learned in 3 years, this book covered in depth plus more. I recommend this to anyone looking to improve themselves physically without the bs and beyond the hype from modern fitness magazines. This book is the truth to getting bigger. Leaner.  Stonger.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Seuss is Seuss! The kid fell in love with it the first time they saw it at the movies. That is when I new we had to add it to our movie collection.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing terror gripped<br /><br />Praise for hunger games<br /> Suzanne Collins has out done herself<br />Can't wait for more<br />Best book by far
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love this sound machine! it has so many options to choose from and they can all be overlapped and customized to the sounds you like to fall asleep to! :)
B003O86FMW|4.0|I really liked Catching Fire . It was very hard to put this book down, I just wanted to keep reading non - stop until I reached the end.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Even if you are not a fan of Will Ferrell, this movie is a must-see that belongs in the category of Christmas Classics.
B0025KVLS8|1.0|this is not the original soundtrack from the movie a hard day's night. there are 4 instrumental songs that george martin conducted on the soundtrack. #1, i should have known better #2, and i love her #3, ringo's theme (this boy) #4, a hard day's night. why weren't they on the soundtrack beats me. he did a awsome job on these 4 songs. how i know is that i have 2 vinyl soundtracks from the movie when it came out & the cd soundtrack by united artists (cd cost me over $40.00 dollars - import from japan). so double check your purchases and see if these 4 songs are on the soundtrack. take care!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I bought this device because my new TV only has digital audio output and my stereo analog input, this interface solves this problem
B007KOMTUI|3.0|I loved the earlier seasons, but this season does not seem to know what to do with itself.  It is on verge of becoming soap opera like and does not seem to be heading anywhere and is divided into two camps: Camp A:  Soap opera like where very little happens over two hours other than minor character development, Camp B:  An unrelated series of episodes.  The series seems far off from the starting series.  If you are already really into the series, ok maybe buy it, otherwise don't bother.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game should be a template for other games, and read on, how the engaging  story makes the already tried gameplay seems refreshing and new. In all fairness, this game is addictive and fun and was worth every penny I did not pay for it.
B00ARAOBKS|2.0|stupid plot that really doesn't make sense.  . . . . . . ... . . . . . .
B008XX6J4C|2.0|I bought this CD for one song.  You don't know you're beautiful.  I like this song but was disappointed in the other selections.
B00447G29S|5.0|The movie itself is great. We have been watching it in one form or another for a couple of years. I picked up this one to have it in blu ray and try out the 3D. It did not disappoint. Amazon was fast with shipping as always and I could not be happier.
075669812X|5.0|My son can't put this book down, he loved it.  For the money, it was a great purchase as it has all the details of the various Ninjago characters.  If your kids like Legos, this is a must have.
B005VPRET4|5.0|As with all Lego products, you can't go wrong.  If you have a child with strong spatial and reasoning ablilities, it provides endless entertainment.  This particular set is really cute!
B001706I5I|4.0|Good Christmas movie for the whole family to enjoy. Jim Carrey is great in this movie. We thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The weather channel app is great. Just like the weather report from tv but you get to decide what to look at and what section of the country to focus on.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ready for book three. I love the fact that Ken Follett is always teaching me a history lesson woven in a tapestry of a beautiful story
0345529057|5.0|Great deal.  It was shipped immediately & came within 5 days.  I was surprised.  This was a Christmas present for my son & he was elated.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|great game, challenging.  wish my s teen was a bit bigger, but it still works.  worth every penny spent. goo!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great program. It has great graphics and is fun to play. I would recommend it to anybody.
B008NEMPTO|3.0|This is not what we expected. I don't think 14 words should be expected. I can say what I feel about a product in a few words.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Please fix the news feed on this, it only loads the first few posts then the rest are grey, refreshing it wouldn't work either
B0095J0AL6|5.0|Even if you're not a fan of them, the songs are really catchy. Both genders will really enjoy these songs. These boys are making a mark in music history, and we will still hear their name in the next few years. And I believe \\"Take Me Home\\" is better than their first album \\"Up All Night\\" since this sophomore album has various genres of songs. ENJOY THIS AMAZING ALBUM.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|i liked that Grisham stretched himself here. The Protagonist is an African American, which was an interesting choice for a white guy from the South. I wouldn't describe the racial commentary as ground-breaking, but some of it was thoughtful.<br /><br />The story is timely - given the (perceived) movement toward expanded government powers and the potential for them to do harm. I was rooting for the less-than-perfect guys the whole way.<br /><br />I read this as fast as I could
B009HEJXFS|3.0|I liked it, is for older kids and adults. First two were for a wider audience. Still worth seeing these actors together.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I like this character and how he has progressed. MR is a great escape from reality and the crumminess of a world that can be very disappointing.
B0085776BG|5.0|Their story was long over due. Godd piture, good sound. Good acting. good script. Add these together and it equals a good movie.
B0035WTE2U|4.0|but wouldn't you know it - just after i ordered this, iTunes started selling their records. but i forgot how good CDs sound, so it was worth the cost
B009SQRL4U|5.0|It has been a very long time to find a very good well thought out plot for an animated film. The graphics, characters, and story line were in sync throughout. I give this a must see movie especially for the kiddos. More of this quality thought needs to come to the forefront. Let us keep making, and thinking about quality and not quantity films. It is refreshing to see a new story without sitting through another remake of an already good movie. The idea in making movies is to intreague the watcher of the movie, not bore him/her into a sleeping stuper, or so much fire and action you forgot where the story was headed in the first place. Bravo to this film maker. THANK YOU.
B000T433CO|5.0|Finally bought this movie, as my husband and I watch it every Christmas -- a great holiday tradition!  Fun, sentimental and sweetly funny as well.  Love this flick.
B008NB0SQO|5.0|In 1836 in merry old London, a sourpuss of a rich middle-aged man named Ebenezer Scrooge (Michael Caine) who has no feeling, kindness or generosity towards others except for himself works at a counting house with a few employees mainly rats and a trust worthy family-man named Bob Crackett (Played by Kermit The Frog voiced by Steve Whitmire)who is underpaid no doubt. On Christmas Eve, he is visited by the Marley Brothers (played by Standoff and Wardorf) tell him that he is in danger for his future that his chains of life will be heavy as he will be cursed with them for he will be visited by three spirits of past, present and future to change his life.<br /><br />An excellent take on Charles Dickens's immortal tale, Walt Disney Pictures and The Jim Henson Company has done of the best Muppet movies ever and one of the best takes on the classic story. Starring Gonzo (Voiced by David Golz) as Charles Dickens with his sidekick Rizzo (Voiced by Steve Whitmire) they tell us the story in their own way with a cast of both humans and muppet characters including appearances by Sprocket from Fraggle Rock with Fozzie Bear (voiced by Frank Oz) as FozzieWig, Miss Piggy (voiced by Frank Oz) as Bob's wife and many others. The songs are quite nice by writer Paul Williams and Caine did a flawless performance as Scrooge, i still remembered when i was 11 seeing this movie 3 times in theaters and blew me away as it became one of my fave Muppet movies and takes on the story.<br /><br />This blu-ray offers superior picture and terrific audio compared to the DVD but is missing the 89 extended cut with the \\"When Love is Song\\" song which you can find on 2005's DVD but if you own that keep it but buy this for the quality and extras like 2 audio commentaries especially by Brian Henson who directed this movie with extras like Disney intermission like you seen on The Muppets blu-ray, blooper reel, documentary and 2 featurettes plus digital copy.
B000FCKBCU|4.0|I love Sophie, her books are always pretty good. This it's not a must read, but it's a good book. :)
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I have watched it 5 times now... and it gets better every time i watch it. Im in love with Fat Amy
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AWESOME the ending was great can't wait .to read the next two books.h hope they are just as good<br />More
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I just don't have the words to describe this book, couldn't put down my Kindle while reading it.  Recommend it highly.
0143121006|5.0|I bought this book after hearing the author speak about it on Public Radio.  Very interesting and would recommend for my book club!
B009RH9HDS|5.0|Comfortable to hold.  Easy to use. Love that it rotates.  Great product for the price definitely worth it.  Item came quickly too.
0525952926|5.0|I bought this book after reading the first of the series.  I love Ken Follett and would recommend all his books.
B008NW67E0|3.0|I don't really enjoy their music, but the daughter does.  I imagine that if I were her age I might find it new and exciting instead of derivative.
159420411X|5.0|My son requested this book for Christmas and does not typically read alot.  He has been enjoying it.<br /><br />A must for financial geeks.
B0032Y8XH8|3.0|As with Babel, I really don't like this band, but my daughter does like them, thus the purchase.  Oh well.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|best free app of day ever! i use to play this on dreamcast all the time. i wanted to buy this awhile back, but some how i forgot about it. loving it on my phone. thanks amazon.
0553328255|5.0|Inspired by the television series, my daughter is reading the originals.  What can anyone say about the canon except that it's wonderful.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|Boring and crap<br />The game is super boring u bassicly just watch the things move. Just a simple plain boring game all u do is put an arrow at a place and watch these dumb things.  So stupid
B002APU580|3.0|Still prefer the Greer Garson, Laurence Olivier version, but this was good.  Wish closed caption was available, since I found some of the dialogue difficult to understand.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Who doesn't like physics experiments wrapped up in a video game? Little goo balls that you build into towers, bridges, and other structures.  Warning... this will consume most of your day.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun. pretty much all that explains it. yea. thats pretty much it really.... umm... catnip. bubbles. raid. lool. almost done.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|This application needs to be reported. you are wasting a dollar and it is simply google's search bar. THIS NEEDS TO BE REPORTEE TO AMAZON AS COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT. GOOGLE DOES NOT AUTHORIZE THIS!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We call it the bad santa game. Stayed up late last night playing it. Santa is sooooo fast and that is why we call it the Bad Santa game. Lots of fun.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Not bad for .99&cent;.  It's more than just a hidden object game; you actually have to put the objects together before they can be found and used.  The story line is fun and easy to follow and the graphics are clear.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I put this rating because the dictionary has many academic words and meanings.It even has words I didn't even know that exists.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a great game to help pass time.  I have it on my husbands kindle and he seems to like it.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|This game has a rich storyline while it also has great puzzles and hidden objects. Perfect 5 stars. Works flawlessly on kindle fire.
B00081U7HC|4.0|This is a great movie.  Both my daughter and I really enjoyed this movie.  She still watches it all the time.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've seen and enjoyed just about every film version of &#34;A Christmas Carol,&#34; but reading this classic was just as pleasurable if not more so.  My favorite film version is the one with Alastair Simm as Scrooge and I couldn't help but match many of the actors from that film to the characters in the book as I was reading it, but that never took away from my experience and I think actually enhanced it.  The book was actually quite a bit shorter than I expected, a little over a hundred pages, but it was rich and well worth the read.  Highly recommended!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I have never played this game but my husband seems to like it.  He has it on his kindle fire
0784011710|5.0|I have a hard time being critical of anything starring Meryl Streep.  The surprises kept it especially interesting.  I would have to add it to one of my all time favorites
B000FC2PKG|3.0|I don't know anything about this book because it was purchased as a gift for someone.  Sorry I don't know whatelse to write
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Fun game wish energy regenerated more quickly<br />Social networking is a disadvantage for young players<br />Having fun playing on our new kindles
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love it but it needs updates. I would prefer special torches to keep monsters out of ur mines and more gold, iron, and flint. That deserves 5 stars.
B00AOB3FES|5.0|Our little one loves this movie.  Reminds her of our Cavalier. And she requested spaghetti and meatballs for dinner (and consumed them)!
B003L77FYS|5.0|ANd now we can have our own Castle marathons when the rest of TV-Land is (as it almost always is) not very good.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is #2 behind Christmas Vacation! Silly story in true Will Farrell style.  Perfect for the holiday season. My wife and I love this movie!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator! Works perfectly and does just what I need it to do. Looks great on the Kindle Fire HD<br /> screen too!!
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|Good - a little confusing (more than necessary to make it &#34;good confusing&#34;), and a little less that I expected from a Bourne movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|As a former P90xer, this video was my first introduction to Jillian. I started with level one and was immediately skeptical with the ease of the workout. It is likely GREAT for beginners, but I was not feeling challenged. So I moved on to level two, and WOW!<br /><br />Level 2 & Level 3 are serious butt kickers, and on mornings where I accidentally sleep in or have an early meeting, I can put this in for 20 minutes and I don't feel like a slug for the rest of the day (how I feel if I don't work out). Great if you don't have a lot of time in the AM.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book kept me up till 3am, can't recall the last time a book kept me up unroll early hours of the morning. Thank you Colleen for this beautiful read.
0439023521|5.0|I know what you're saying what took you so long to read this book, to be honest I just have a crazy insane TBR list and it just kept getting pushed back.  So when my son got The Hunger Games for Christmas on DVD we watched Christmas Night and I knew immediately I had to read the book afterwards. I had too many questions from the movie.<br /><br />I seriously could kick myself for waiting so long in reading this book, what was wrong with me? What was I thinking?  Because not only did this book answer those questions I had, but painted an even better picture of the characters, as well as the story.  Now I know what the fuss is all about.<br /><br />I would have read this in one setting if I hadn't been so tired last night.  The story flowed and I just love the characters.  I am not sure which Team I am on but I can say I absolutely love Katniss , she is a spunky character and not once was I annoyed with her.  As a parent I can't even imagine sending my child off to the Hunger Games.<br /><br />I honestly can't wait to read Catching Fire, and I promise I won't wait so long to read that one.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The Graphics are suprisingly amazing and this game does not get as much attetion as it should. You only have to pay for things if yiu are impatient overall very good.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Yes it's long. I watch long movies at home so I can split it over two sessions. Movies want to cover more complex things and it takes more time. The character building was worth it; it would have been a boring movie if it was just a batman v. bane testosterone fest. The ladies were phenomenal. I'm glad catwoman carried serious weight (as a character and in the action) while \\"robin\\" was just starting to figure the world out and was lucky he didn't get himself killed. Of course I'm sad it wasn't as action-packed as the 2nd, but the boy singing the National Anthem was spot on for the mood of #3. And so much character development of Bruce Wayne and the symbol of the Batman. Expect more from your comic book movies! Bravo Christopher Nolan for a job well done.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|The Graphics are suprisingly amazing and this game does not get as much attetion as it should. You only have to pay for things if yiu are impatient overall very good.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Both my 12 yr old son and I can play this game. It is fun trying to wipe out the human race, much better on a Kindle than the phone.
B005H29GSI|4.0|Bought this for my nieces and nephews and they enjoyed it as much as they enjoy playing with the application.
B000AQJPQE|5.0|My 6 year old grandson received this as a Christmas present from us and he wanted to put it up right away.  He was very excited once it was up as he is very interested in the solar system and I would recommend this purchase to others.
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|A great follow-up taster to her debut, \\"Paradise\\" captures all the haunting and nuanced aspects of Lana Del Rey's voice and just builds on her whole persona.  Some have mixed reviews about her due to some off-kilter live performances, but I still think this girl has something we don't see in modern music often.  I must say I am a huge fan of her reimagined \\"Blue Velvet\\" - she gives it an almost-creepy vibe. I would most certainly recommend this album to any present fans or those still on the fence.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I would like this app if one irritating feature was fixed.  I can not view the radar map without selecting a location first.  Then after choosing a location, which is not a problem, the app puts a pin on the radar map which includes a HUGE weather temp. speech bubble on top of my location that can not be closed.  That's a problem!  It makes it hard to get a clear idea of the weather pattern over my area.
B009MCRHH6|2.0|Can't see enough screen and it dances around.  Very difficult when you can't see where you are going.<br />Need KF version.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Well written, with enough technical know-how to generate credibility. All while being wrapped within a believable plot and characters. Great read.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|Gossip Girl is one of the best shows in my era because there has never been anything like it. All of the other shows are very predictable and with Gossip Girl, no one knew what to expect next episode. I love it!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Hard to beat the system....quite a challenge but is is possible.....great game especially since it is free...enjoying my Kindle Fire...
B0066WJLU6|3.0|If you need light this would be better than nothing, but it could be improved if it were brighter.  Some may like the colors.
B00425S1H8|5.0|great deal.  good product. been using this for a few years and never had any problems. hope you find it the same.
1419705849|5.0|Great binding for hard-back book at a great cost! My son has collected the entire series and enjoyed reading this book just like the others.
B002WY65VU|5.0|i totally love this movie! makes me laugh every time i watch it. and ive seen it quite a few times
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was a quick and enjoyable book! The characters were really cute and I enjoyed their love story. I liked the way that he finally realized that he loved her and went to her...the author did a great job writing the emotions of the reunion.
B001MSMULG|5.0|I like the Spy thriller category and this book does a great job setting up Gabriel for future Books.  Good Job giving a different perspective using the Israeli Intelligence when most people are used to American Spy Thrillers.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|great game but there should be a greater variety of mini-games and it is ridiculous that you HAVE TO BUY GEMS to get some of the ponies required for gameplay.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very quick read,, you don't realize what you have until it's gone :)  a a a a a a a
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The movie was great for everyone of all ages. I loved it, and so did my whole family. Wonderful movie!
B005LAIHHC|5.0|I found this movie to be funny but my wife hated it.<br />Then again I have a twisted sense of humor and at times she probably wonders why she married me.<br />It has to be the money! lol It is one of those movie that you like or hate. Check it out and if you don't like it, ship it back. Fairly simple process for most.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Lots of action, enjoyed the cast. Very fun movie, would recommend it to anyone. Only wish Jet Li had a bigger part in the movie
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Went to see the 3D version of this movie when it first came out in theaters and loved it!<br />When it came out on dvd I bought it. Before it came out in Blu Ray 3D format, I pre-ordered it about<br />6 months in advance. I now enjoy the full 3D theater experience in my livingroom and gave the DVD version to my<br />sister so she and her grandkids can enjoy it. I highly recommend!
B000VHMF0A|5.0|If you are a lover of reggae,this cd has got to be in your collection. Mr Marley was at his best and a must have.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|This app is very convenient, was able to order my wifes Christmas gift almost as she told me what she wanted.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|tried to purchase the counterfeit machine but didn't work. other than that the game is just pure greatness. my brother saw me playing it than downloaded it and wont stop playing. h'es 20yr.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I've never questioned heaven. Even so this book was everything I wanted it to be.<br />With the exception of a miracle which was an added joy.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This was a very well acted production . The movie was mostly action with little lag time.<br />Out door scenes were fantastic and breath taking.<br />If you like magic, swords and castles, this is your movie<br /><br />Dan LaDuke
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I cannot get it on my kindle which is where it was supposed to go, showed up on my daughter's Kindle and it's enjoyable.  Still trying to figure why unable to get on mine.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This may not be a review but there is no need for this app because my kindle fire came with a facebook app. If you can connect to the internet which if you read this you must have internet anyway you can type facebook on the internet then boom sign in and your on.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I read this book in 2 days. I picked it because it was cheap and labelled as a cult classic. I'm not quite sure if I understood what the author wanted me to gain but I have been left with this excitement. I believe I have read something I will carry with me. Must read.
B00AA7O22U|4.0|Watch it if you are an action movie fan and looking for movie with ur favourite action hero in it. Pick a action star from the the past and they appear in the movie one by one. Story and comedy could have been better but I guess its hard to expect that from a movie of action heroes.. Definitely watch it for the action!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a good waste of $6.99. It's a lot of money but it's really addicting and fun.<br />On creative you can make your dream land and your inventory will be full with gold,diamonds,iron,different colors of wool and more than survival. Survival you have to dig and find the stuff you need to survive with which I think is sometimes more fun. There are zombies,skeletons,spiders and creepers at night and sometimes in the day time it makes survival fun and I'm addict to going outside at night and spying on them. I suggest buying it on kindle than I touch because I had lots of viruses on I touch. But the BEST is on computer and X box.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I played this app on my Kindle Fire.  It ran well, and I had no issues with downloading it or actual gameplay.  My issues were with the ads.  I am perfectly aware this is a free app.  I expect advertisements.  And when I first downloaded the game, it was a lot of fun with manageable ads.  It only had an ad banner across the top during game play.  It was simple and non-intrusive.  The game really is a great time-waster.  But over the last couple of days, the ads have become incredibly intrusive.  The ad banner is still there, but now \\"Angry Birds\\" is advertising their own products.  No, I don't want to download the video off YouTube, and I don't feel I  should have to tell you this after every screen.  No, I do not want to download other \\"Angry Bird\\" apps.  I'm trying to play one right now!  And, again, I don't feel I should have to tell you this after every screen.  Even though the game itself is incredibly addictive and a lot of fun, the ads have become way too much.  I just deleted the game from my account.  It really is a shame, because the game is a lot of fun.  But it began to seem like I was spending as much time on the ads as I was on actually playing.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book was amazing! I'll definitely need to buy the rest. This book is one of my new favorites for sure.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This is a great app. I love waking up to the sounds rather than beep beep beep every stink.&acute;n  mourning.
B003ODIZL6|3.0|The puppies are so cute and cuddle with them. I can only hug them to death because they are so cute
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Loved the book.  It was so informative.  It is a bit long but worth the time.  Would recommend to anyone.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|I believe that dictionaries are helpful to children because the children can get to understand what the words mean and should be able to write a sentence or even more. Students and adults should be able to understand the meaning of the word
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I bought this book with low expectations having been disappointed with some self published books I've read on here. The consistent good reviews and ridiculously low price persuaded me to give it a go. I was so pleasantly surprised. I read it in two sittings and would have done so in one if Christmas hadn't interrupted!<br /><br />The tone of the main character's point of view was a delight and the story was interesting and compelling. I'm looking forward to the next in the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This whole series is awesome I loved reading them on my kindle he this book is a must have five stars.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Never made it to the theater to see it so i was glad i was able to get it through amazon. Another great Clint Eastwood movie. No need to say more!
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Know Gladwell's style well from the New Yorker and The Tipping Point.  He doesn't disappoint with this fascinating and valuable account of success.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|Very user friendly! I love to play backgammon but have found other computer versions would allow the computer to win 99% of the time, which was very frustrating. I have to say, I have out played the computer the majority of the time and if the computer wins, it is fair and square. I have it on my Kindle Fire HD and love, love, LOVE it!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Interesting and unique characters.  Action keeps you on the edge of your seat. Plot was not predictable and so it kept you guessing as to what was coming next.
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|I got this product for my son's birthday.  He always wanted to make glasses from cool looking bottles.  During research online, I found the video on You Tube of the man who uses this and he was very helpful and showed how simple the process is.  It was very easy to put together and get started immediately.  All you need is one simple score around the bottle...don't overcut!  Great product, so simple compared to the other products and goofy mehtods out there.
B00A3ATW4M|5.0|I love the music of Glee. They do the remakes of other songs and most sound as good as if not better than the original. I guess I really am a 'GLEEK'.
B007THA4FI|4.0|By the end of this book, I was hooked, but it takes a while to hit its stride. It's very, very sad, as well, but I thought it worth the read. DEFINITELY not in the Potter genre.
B0091XRL86|5.0|Rented this for my son 9 year old, he's seen all of these and loves them.  I would definitely recommend for the family.
0452289963|5.0|This book is not just only Spiritual in our Minds, but motivates us also Mentally and Physically altogether. I'm totally grateful for the powerful writing coming from the Mastermind of Mr. Eckhart Tolle. He speaks very trueful, real in depth and almost self-satisfied. He doesn't portray no image nor ego but dealing with the Human Mind and Inner Self that we all have in our Daily Minds as we still here on Our Earth. I love every chapter that deals with a great perspective in a mind of its own.<br /><br />I also suggest reading [[ASIN:B002361MLA The Power of Now]] which is one of the best sellers and most talked about books of all-time. If you or anyone has dealt with any pain, any kind of suffering, or going thru a certain situation in life, I greatly recommend reading this along with Neale Walsch's Conversations with God book series, [[ASIN:1582701709 The Secret]], [[ASIN:B0007OB40E The Four Agreements]], [[ASIN:0446670642 10 Natural Laws of Successful Time and Life Management]], [[ASIN:0070246440 Time Tactics of Very Successful People]], among a few.<br /><br />There's no question you can't be denied or turn away from the teachings and writings behind Mr. Tolle.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|There are many scenes in the film I found quite boring in the dialog. The action scenes of course are very exciting while you're glued to the scene absorbing all the action and noise.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Picked this book on a whim and was completely engrossed from the first page. Funny, heartbreaking, poignant, wise. These are just a few of the words I would use to describe this EXCELLENT book.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Great locations and explosive color in backgrounds. Enough to make you want to visit India though far away. Great cast of all star talent.
B004X75RK4|5.0|This movie is quite funny through out.  There are a few parts that you don't want to watch with your parents in the room, but overall a great movie.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This book came well recommended; however, I feel that there wasn't much to tell of his experience to share in a book. I felt like some chapters were just a variation on the same experience he shared in previous chapters.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This is a great show.  We love it.  Great story lines and characters.  The first season does a great job of introducing the characters and their back stories.
0060531053|5.0|Perfect for all the scientific minded beer brewers out there.  Essential guide to more creative recipes and beer concoctions. Must have.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|One of the great SEGA Dreamcast puzzle games on your touch screen device!<br /><br />Pros:<br />* Smooth graphics<br />* Great controls<br />* 500 lvls<br />* Challenging<br />* Non intruding install permissions
B008TW1EP6|5.0|I remember reading this as a child and saw only the wonderful fantasy of the story. As an adult you are open to the deeper meaning and analogy of the story. A must read for all Christians.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This is the toy you start playing with and hours later you're still at it!!  Fun for (older) kids through adults.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Very entertaining series of books, perhaps a warning to our time that if we do not pull together as a nation we run the risk of fracturing into the social schism of haves and have nots you find in this story.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|Family really enjoyed this movie. We have children ages 11, 10, and 6, and this movie was enjoyed by us all. Especially enjoyed watching it on Christmas day.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|As far as I can see the overt interest that has been generated by this book is due solely to the perversity of the characters sexual habits. Titillation and ridiculous situations are rife in this poorly written Harlequin romance!
B008P1EWIM|4.0|So simple to use and fun to look at. I set up forecasts for family members who live far away,<br />which helps with travel plans.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Using this on my kindle fire and am very happy.  Very nicely written.  Works perfectly and never have any problems with it.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|My kids love this application they play and they are trying to learn the musical notes and this app helps them and they enjoy it
0446554995|5.0|Preston and Child leave you on the edge of your seat with this third book. Agent Pendergast sometimes gets you mad but you can't help but love his character. He finds a way to deal with some hardships but ultimatley comes out on top even though he might of met his match the book leaves you with a lot of twists and turns. Leaving room for perhaps another three book series. Two thumbs way up for Preston & Child.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I haven't seem this movie so cannot comment on it. It was a gift  for my mother and she enjoyed it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a really powerful book . Strong and bold. I recommend this book to other viewers. I can't wait until I start reading the second!
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I have not seen this movie , myself, so cannot comment on it. It was a gift for my daughter in law and she was very happy receiving it.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Haven't used this yet, but it seems very simple to use and I added it quickly and easily to my new tablet.
6305278016|5.0|This was a gift for my son. I have never seen the movie so cannot comment on it. However my son was happy so that's all that counts.
1451695195|5.0|Since most men and women of science don't believe much in the spiritial realm, this NDE might be a bit of an eye opener for them since this happened to a neuroscientist.
B000AP04NI|5.0|A gift for my husband. He loves old musicals so will be looking forward to watching it when the holiday rush is over.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This is he Funniest Christmas movie I had ever seen!!! I love all the characters!!! ★ Especially Buddy was awesome.★
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The carefully selected songs from different Broadway shows definitely showcase her talent. Dueting with Donny Osmond and Michael Crawford was brilliant. Susan Boyle has come a long way in her musical journey. I recall her appearence on Britain's Got Talent and the stunned judges and audience when she began to sing. Her makeover and song choices along the way showed that a person of her age taking a chance can make it big! Would recommend this CD to those who love some of the greatest songs from the stage. It is a diversified collection. Bravo Susan!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I just loved this book! Once I started reading I just couldn't stop reading! A must read! I can't wait for the movie!
B005OT2YVA|4.0|So for all of you people saying this movie was bad take a step back and look at what you are watching. This is a Hollywood Movie made for an audience who loves Explosions, Cars, Guns, Sexy Women, and a simple story line. This movie was not made to be realistic it is a SCI FI movie. Just pop some corn watch it and enjoy. Way better than the Notebook or any other chick flick out there.
630529142X|5.0|i rate this at 100%. this movie is is off the charts and i recommend this movie to any body. thank you
B0094BB4TW|2.0|When I scroll down on status updates, they wont load. It has happened multiple times. Besides that it isn't hopeless, but it is a pretty major problem.
B0007OCG56|5.0|i rate this at 100%. i would recommend this to any body. the product was very awesome. thank you so much
B0054XOMX4|5.0|My six year old grandson is into Beyblades big time....he has eight others in his current collection.  This one makes nine and is the best of the bunch.  This Bey will spin when others have long since gone down.  It is incredible how long &#34;he&#34; will stay spinning.  Before purchasing this Bey, I spent considerable time reading the plethora of reviews of the many different Beyblades available....I have to agree that the Japanese made Beys are truly the best.  After watching the Phantom Orion in action many times over, it never loses!
B005F3XV62|5.0|i would recommend this to any body. i really liked it and i would buy more. thank you so much
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is awsome! After you get the hang of this game you have so many choices of levels and places to beat!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|The game is very easy to use and very easy to set to your specific level of play.  A nice game.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use yahoo everyday for communication and it is great. Give it a try and the best part is you can put stuff in your spam for good!
B00ARAO720|4.0|This movie was entertaining. Although some of it reminded me of a Kevin Beacon movie yrs ago Quick Silver.... I still enjoyed this  movie & I really liked the acters. Well done!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Just started to play this game & loving it! It pass the time by when you are waiting and then sad when you have to stop.
B008O9V4C2|5.0|What can I say, I've been a Steely Dan and Donald Fagen fan for a long time.<br />Hold on to that slinky thing. Keep them coming.
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|Much better than the original. However, parts if it resembled a video game instead of great computer graphics. The action was good, but the last 45 minutes dragged.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My son loves this movie!  We saw it together & I knew it would be the perfect Christmas present.  Also I got an amazing deal on the price!
030758836X|1.0|I'm hearing so many great things about this one, I can barely wait to read it.  I wanted to get it for Christmas, but no one bought it for me.  Which brings me to my point....if anyone's willing to lend me their copy, I would be eternally grateful.  I prefer hardcovers because the backs can be used as a desk of sorts, should I decide to write a post card and need a surface to write it on.  (Not that I plan on writing any, I'm just sayin')  Ok, so thanks loads.  Please response with your phone number and I'll give you my address.  Thanks. PS  THe only reason I gave it 1 star is cuz I haven't read it yet and I hardly find it fair to give it 5 stars.  I do reserve the right however to amend my review should I see fit at a later point in time....as it were.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This app was great. l set the alarm for three days a week and the alarm went off on time on those dates.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Polar Express was a great movie.  After reading the book, it was great to see the realistic action on screen.  The animation of the characters was very lifelike. The story formation caught my undivided attention throughout the movie.  Loved it!  A great movie for all ages.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|Continues to crash - unable to play most planes.  I should get my money back!  I have 4th generation iPod.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Easy and fun to read. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Highly recommend if you enjoyed the first book
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son (9.5yrs) loves this game - he has built cruise ships, forts, towers and intricate buildings.  I get frustrated at the controls, but he is quick and agile in manuevering.  Looks forward to updates!
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Excellent, i love it.<br /><br />Very good experience.<br /><br />I recommend this TV series to all<br /><br />I hope to watch the following seasons
B0084IG8TM|5.0|This was a Christmas present to my wife. This is one of our favorite movies. We loved the books and we can't wait for the next two movies to come out. I love the fact this comes with a digital copy. This will for sure be on my tablet.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got it and it is awesome. So cool with with multi player. One suggestion, it needs flint and sterling creative mode. This game is the bomb,oops I mean the TNT.
B001CQONKY|5.0|i love csi, and this makes it so nice and easy to get the shows i like -- great prices and comes to me
B009KS4XRO|4.0|You have to play on a computer to be able to play all the games and receive all bonuses. Not very tablet or smart phone friendly yet.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|It allows me to stay in touch with my friends and family. having it on my Kindle Fire tablet is wonderful. I would recommend it to a friend.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game. Got hooked on it for most of the day. Easy to access and customer friendly.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is a fast-paced game.I would recommend it to a friend!  It is easy to play and any age group can play it
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|I' m not able to see pages I know uses Adobe flash normally. I am wondering if I need a newwe version of Adobe flash.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's nice to have on my Kindle tablet. It is easy to play and very entertaining. Glad to have it on my Kindle and would recommend it to a friend.
B006YC74E8|3.0|Anything that allows you to play with your photos is fun. be I have not used this to<br /> much yet.
B001992NUQ|5.0|Awesome movie. Great picture quality and sound. Fantastic Special Features! Really funny prank on the menu! Great Buy! Great Addition to my Movie Collection!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This is a great and convenient way to check into my face book. This saves me time doing one of my favorite things.
B0041KVWI4|5.0|Best Xmas gift I've ever received. This album is amazing ! Every song is fantastic! The record sounds amazing! Great price too! Awesome buy! Must have for a Beatles fan!
B007XC9BSK|2.0|When i was shopping, maybe i should've read the reviews. For as much money as this was i thought for sure there were gonna be cars in it too. All the pictures i had seen had the cars in it too. So dissapointed when i got it. Just an empty Mack with no cars inside. Paid way too much for this.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Bought this movie and was very impressed great price and a wonderful Christmas gift for my daughter! Cute movie to!
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|it is a good way to waste some time. you can play. and lose track of time. I like that you can biuld your force and mold it tour your way....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it is sort of like temple run, but 1,000 times better. here is a hint, don't get the super sneakers unless it is an objective or you have to.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved it! It was impossible to put down! 5 stars, hands down! I am so excited to see the movie!!!
B005UA0FLE|3.0|Bought this for the wife. She's a huge Buble fan. She found the album to be pretty run of the mill. A few interesting points. He changed up \\"Santa Baby\\" to be sung from a guys perspective, which is interesting to say the least. Overall it's your usual \\"Pop star does Christmas\\" fodder. If your a die hard Buble fan you might get a small, if not forgettable, kick out of it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I didn't believe my friends told me this was good book it ended up being one of the best books I ever read
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I've played this game over four times now, still keeps me entertained through and through! Would recommend to all of my friends and family. The sound effects in this game are just great.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|A very funny book about two kids who fight a lot and makes a really funny book with lots of comedy.Is a should be mine for family and all.
B0058YPL66|5.0|My daughter and I had a lot of fun getting up to speed with this series before the second series started - so glad we found this!!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|That was so good. I loved it. It was like I was actually in the story and you should make a movie if you haven't yet.
1419705849|5.0|My son continues to enjoy this series and was very excited to open the latest!  I'm sure he'll read it many times, as he has with all the others!
B0058VW36U|4.0|I like this game but it has some pop ups that I get annoyed by.But for the most part it is definitely worth your money :)
B000HKW7E0|5.0|A true classic. Still makes me laugh from the beginning to the end.<br />The quality of the streaming (SD) was very good
B00000DHTF|5.0|If you really want to know how good Bruce Springsteen is, buy this boxed set. These are the songs that DIDN'T make the final cut of many of his great studio albums. You will be stunned at how good they are. Your collection is incomplete without this set.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|On the precipice of the indie game revolution. This is great for on the go.  Music, color, and physics do not disappoint.
B000069HKH|5.0|This is one of my favorite Springsteen albums ! The songs collectively capture the mood of one of the more difficult times in our country's history. This is Bruce and the Band and it's very best !
B00280LYHS|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read :) truly a great book you'll never want to not read it
B004PAHZMC|5.0|My nephew loved the fact that he can bring all of his Star Wars Lego sets to school and his friends houses in this very cool looking case. Also, he can display his finished pieces in his bedroom on the battle bridge. This is a multifunctional case that the kids will love ! Parents will also like it as it will help keep Lego pieces off the floor. A great buy !
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is amazing! I had a ton of fun playing the full version and I look forward to many more games,no matter the price.
B00005AFVR|5.0|If you have never had a chance to see Bruce perform live, buy this album. You will then hear what you have been missing. The set list is terrific, Bruce is in fine voice and the band is better than every ! Don't hesitate on this one !
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Very entertaining movie.  Same folks that put out &#34;Up&#34;.  Good story line.  Rented for grandkids, but whole family enjoyed.  Get the popcorn out.
B003Y74KC0|4.0|If you are like me and just want a basic good looking case for your iPhone that will provide protection from the occasional drop, this is the case for you. It actually looks very nice on the phone, is comfortable to hold, doesn't block any of the ports, and will offer great protection. A solid buy !
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|So many people struggle with the plot of children killing children.  I found the all three books to be a quick read and not gory at all.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|I was intrigued by Steven Tyler this year, and no, I never watched the show he was hired as a judge. I just like Aerosmith and Steven Tyler (though I did read his autobio).<br />This cd proves that Aerosmith still has it. It's not as hard-driving as some may suspect it should be, but the songs are woven in a tapestry that kept me listening and enjoying. I recommend this cd for not only the &#34;old&#34; Aerosmith-ers, but to the newbies out there. There's an edge to their songs and lyrics. I don't feel that it's just a way to make money; I think it's really rock poetry.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I enjoy playing this game but I hate the ads.  Limited value to me.  I guess thats the price you pay for freeware.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Gave it to our 6-year-old gandson as a Hanukkah present -- He loves it!  He's having a blast building things with it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Enjoyed the story and although  I enjoy some sexual scenes I think it is overloaded. I found myself skipping over a lot JUST to get to story.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I loved loved loved this, I recommend this to anyone who likes a little twist on all the fairytales you've ever known.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this is the best game ever and it free plus it will last you  long time you have to try it its awesome
B007HO392S|5.0|This CD was a Christmas gift for my daughter. It was one that she wanted. I especially liked the price since it was way more expensive at walmart!
B005LAII80|5.0|Amazon Prime, in its typical wisdom, is making \\"Dredd\\" available for viewing right now if you try to watch \\"Dread\\" - idiots
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander, an accomplished neurosurgeon, is the only one who could tell the story of a near-death experience from this perspective.  This is an engaging read that is tough to put down.  If you enjoyed Heaven Is For Real, but would like an adult version, this is for you.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was a good book it shows what love is like in middle school and how hard it is to find a date at there age
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Stylish, gripping, engrossing, and gives you the thrill of being an in-the-know, sophisticated participant of victory of good over evil, without revealing to you the killer on a cold case, unless you figure it out about 4/5 ths of the way through. The cold case is the disappearance of a granddaughter of a Swedish millionaire. You are given a long litany of the family, but it's fast and confusing.<br /><br />This movie projects the anti-fascist values of book author Stieg Larsson, yet it could have done more (and gone beyond the book). The ball was dropped on its full potential on that point, for one. (I have not read the book, but I have read about the prematurely-deceased Larsson.)<br /><br />Though there was extensive use of older actors in the film, I did not like the fast cuts away from them (the sisters, mates, librarians). It was annoying on more than one level. The sister in London especially deserved more. Some humor there too. That said, the heroes, especially heroine portrayed by newcomer Rooney Mara, are fantastic.<br /><br />Gratuitous sex, beware, parents.<br /><br />As far as technology, very smart. As far as styling, bring it on. Love the music, especially Led Zeppelin starter, Immigrant Song.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|I needed a new book and this was recommended. I did not know what to expect, but it was a great read.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Four and a half stars!! Safe Haven is such a good read that had me on the edge of my seat towards the end and having ridiculous emotions towards each character throughout the whole book!it was A completely beautiful story and empowering as a young woman to follow the young heroines story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I wanted just a plain basic calculator, and this one is just that. And very easy to use, also big enough to see easily.
B005P4PAVK|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV. The quality of the download is crisp and clear..One of my favorite shows
B0084I9QI2|5.0|It includes a DVD and descriptive booklets too so you get to know all about all the songs and other info too. I highly recommend it for the Michael Jackson fan, of which this old lady is one!
B009VSW15Y|1.0|First I don't think that after purchasing the Kindle Fire I feel that I should not have to buy the \\"AP\\" for this product. The camera only face one way, you can not take pics of those surrounding you.. The picture quality is poor..I would not recommend this product to anyone,,
B003YNFAWI|5.0|I enjoyed the human reach this movie without appealing to costly and high tech ensemble.  I believe there should be more movies inspired on the good nature of mankind.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I really enjoy this game.You have to think a little but it is not too dificult for younger players.The graphics are very good.I would recomend this game .
B002JVWR9U|5.0|My fiance and I love this series. At first he thought it was girly but after watching it, he enjoys it too.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is everyones favorite. Pac-man has been around for a long time and everyone loves it. Young and old like it
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app for the Weather Channel is great! Besides getting the necessary info particular to my area, it sends out Alerts, etc to keep me informed.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is not my favorite I can't keep up with it. My grandchildren are the ones who like this one
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Sanderson is an amazing writter.  I do not feel that you could go wrong with any of his books. This is an amazing shortish story from him that is very enjoyable.  The characters are well developed, the fantasy scenario is completely unique and not stolen from other writers, and you are compelled to finish the book.  The sign of a very good book is that you want to continue knowing what will happen even after the story is completed, and that definitely happened with this book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Very fun solitare game.You have to use your thinker to play this game. Play this one a lot and enjoy it
B009OA57MI|3.0|Program crashes a lot and I frequently have to re-boot tablet and start all over again. I woul d pay for a version that operated independently of the Internet.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Another one of my grandson and granddaughters favorites. young and old at my house like this game. It is fun
B0066W1AZK|5.0|A great game but the adds may be tampering with the buffering that is going on.  Chess clock is a great add on
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Love this album.  Really dig Phillips unique and raspy voice.  I know I am not the first to say, &#34;he reminds me of a young Dave Mathews&#34;.  Good album
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Loaded my first book with ease.  I am surprised that there isn't a high tech book mark in the application.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Good action film. The fact it had a new star was not a problem. I had seen the previous three and was not disappointed.
B000SSPL0I|3.0|La Forza del Destino is not my favorite Verdi opera, but I did want to have one good production of it, so, after some search, I settled on this one. Mario del Monaco is an interesting tenor, but on strict vocal criteria, I don't think he is one of the greatest. Renata Tebaldi made Leonora her signature role, so if you are to buy only one opera with her, this should be it. There is something flat or boring about her voice, though, so I can't say that she touched me deeply. For me the main highlight was Ettore Bastianini's voice: probably one of the two best baritones I've ever heard (the other being N. Herlea).
B005HSL626|5.0|For those who have played Fruit Ninja on other platforms, this is pretty much what you'd hope/expect to get.  I like that there are different requirements to get the different backgrounds and blades to add a little variety to the game.  It works well on the Kindle, and it is free, so I get more than I paid for.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good game if bored. I play it before bed to make me tired. or while the baby sleeps
B007THA4FI|5.0|J.K. Rowling develops complex characters to fit her complex plot. At first I thought, I'll never keep track of all these characters, but as Rowling slowly weaves them closer together, each character becomes clearer. They become more and more real and rounded. These are no romantic characters she has created; she allows them all the foibles of genuine people. With that comes genuine life. Anyone raised in a small community, either in England or the US, will recognize many of the people who inhabit these pages. The Casual Vacancy contains surprises that the reader is not expecting, even when foreshadowed. I haven't finished it yet, but it becomes more difficult to put down the further into it I become.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This won the game of the year award last year, and I now know why. It was a great family game AND a great game to play with friends. Good game for strategy, but not too difficult to figure out so beginners can join in and pick it up fast.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I read  a few reviews. Mostly positive so I bought 3 for Christmas. One of those for me. I already had a LIFEPROOF case I bought from AT&T. The new (fake) one doesn't compare. It fits the phone poorly, the screen cover doesn't fit the phone screen snuggley and it bounces when typing.  It may protect the phone if dropped, but I wouldn't trust it to be waterproof. The fake one is missing seals around  the speaker and camera lens, and the adapter inside for the on/off switch fell out when I took it out of the package. Not returning but I will not be buying from this vendor or any vendor other than LIFEPROOF from now on.
0345803507|5.0|This a wonderful love story. I would recommend it to everyone. If you aren't reading it you are missing out!
B000SGRONM|5.0|I've loved every David Sedaris book I've read and this one did not disappoint. It made me lol, I highly recommend it even if you've not read his other books
0345803485|5.0|I would recommend this book, because it is a very good reading book. I read the whole set in less than a week! It was so good that i may start over reading them again. If you have not read this you are really missing out.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book even though I had to re-read some parts it was great and I am very glad I took my friend's advice and read it.
B000000XB9|5.0|The music is great. Sound quality is excellent and it is just as I expected it to be.  CCR is terrific.
B00AAAKH80|5.0|To my surprise this is a very good cd. Very mood lifting rockish country. Buy it you won't regret it
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I was surprised to find this here for so cheap, I thought it was only going to be a digital copy or something.  Nope! Full DVD features and everything. Great movie!
B002MYUEWQ|5.0|Great memories of watching this as a kid with my Dad.  I introduced it to my 11 yr old daughter who received a Kindle from Santa this year. We watched together in our PJ's on the couch on her new Kindle.  She loved it and so did I!
B001OQCV6A|5.0|I was surprised to find this here for so cheap, I thought it was only going to be a digital copy or something.  Nope! Full DVD features and everything.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This was a great book with mind chilling events and great bravery. I would recommend this book to anyone that has read and liked mystery and adventure books.
0393932192|5.0|Definitely my favorite read of the semester! I loved the articles I was able to pull from included in the back.  The book is only about a fourth of the length as the actual text while the rest of the text is literary analysis of Achebe.  Loved that I didn't have to Google random stuff to try and find something to write on.
B000002KHH|5.0|Awesome songs on this classic album, is a must for every Black Sabbath fan to have. So, get this one
B005LAIH4A|5.0|My Grandson loves this movie.  It was his bday party theme. Ordered as a Christmas gift and it was received in plenty of time.
B000002KB8|5.0|this is the first album of Black Sabbath, so a good classic. If you like Black Sabbath, this cd is a must
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|I didn't realize you couldn't take pictures of anything but yourself. So this is applicatiion is  useless. Guess I had better read more carefully next time.
B000002KDO|5.0|classic album, Black Sabbath fans should have this one. Black Sabbath is the godfather of heavy metal, so buy it
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have thought you had more than just the &#34;simple&#34; solitaire game like the Spider Solitare on most pc's..
B0011Z1BQK|5.0|This is my all time favorite album  by Led Zep.Great lyrics and the music is incredible! A must have for any Zep fan!
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this movie and you need to watch the original in black and white!  The colorized version is not fit for human consumption.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|its a fun game,get it now,wat till you see all the levels,its very very exciting,it will keep you comming back for more
B007Q35PLI|4.0|This was a great movie. I had to watch it for college class and am so happy that I did, because I loved it! Everyone should watch this movie!! The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the quality of the video. It was really grainy, but still viewable!
1449410243|5.0|I expected it to be thinner, so it quite surpassed my expectations pages-wise.<br /><br />As for the content, I'm not really that much impressed since I've read many of the shorts before online. But I rate it a 5/5 for novelty's sake.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Gameloft has delivered the very best MOBA experience for handheld platforms!  If you are a fan of League of Legends, Heroes of Newerth or DotA, you simply must download this game!  I also love that it's based on the Order and Chaos universe, a solid MOBA companion to their excellent MMORPG!  Gameloft is AMAZING!
B0058YPGSY|1.0|It skips on every cd... It's sad. Other than that fine but  I missed a couple episodes on ever disc
B002XTBE6K|5.0|We enjoy Emma movies, so had to get this one for our collection. We like the background information given for several of the main characters that is not in the other &#34;Emma&#34; movies. So now we understand the relationships much better.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|A misunderstanding is a major building block of comedy.  This movie is full of misunderstandings and the results are hilarious.<br />For Tucker and Dale life revolves around beer, fishing and hanging out.  Not the sharpest knife in the drawer or troubled by complex thoughts, they enjoy a simple life.<br />This weekend, at the \\"summer home\\", they plan to drink beer, fish and do some repair work.<br /><br />The college kids are going camping in the woods.  They plan to drink beer, smoke some grass and skinny dip.<br />This is their break away from the pressure of college.<br /><br />Both groups stop at a country store and things go downhill from there.<br /><br />This is a spoof on every mad killer in the woods film ever made.  You can see the jokes a mile away but they are still funny.<br />Tucker and Dale work as the hillbillies, with no false notes.  Most of the college kids only have to die.<br />The actors do so in a variety of improbable ways.<br /><br />As the body count increases the laughs are faster and faster.<br /><br />This is great fun, totally mindless and a good laugh.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|this was kind of boring to play.  Maybe because of all the hype regarding it, I was disappointed.  Glad it was free.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|These Legos were the hightlight of my grandson's Christmas presents.  They love Minecraft and putting Legos together.  It was their favorite thing.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|It was a really enjoyable movie:  better in the beginning than the middle, I think.  I would've loved to have seen it on the big screen.
0761169431|5.0|Amazing book!!!!  I know the author of the book and he has worked on getting this book published for years and never gave up on his dreams!  He is an amazing guy and has created an amazing book!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This is your married-quickly-trying-to-make-it-work formula, which is often fun.  This book does it well I thought.  The Conner and Megan don't want love because of issues in their past, just a happy companionship.  Of course, they get along so well they fall in love and this causes complications with their plan.  It's a nice read, explicit sex scenes so not for young teens.  Happy ending, fun characters, worth free or even a couple dollars in my opinion.  I didn't notice extensive editing issues and the books flows well.  I don't recall anything repetitive in the dialogue.  It was a fun book.  My verdict: Worth your time!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is an amazing read.  It kept me riveted from beginning to end with the characters highs and lows it is definitely an emotional roller coaster.
B005UPOAT2|5.0|The absolute best service, quick and seamless.  Getting this for Christmas made everything complete for my family.  Thanks for your service.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Great movie! Did not disappoint! Love the Bourne series and I can't wait for the next one. Lots of action!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really liked this book<br />I would recommend  this book for people who like being left there hanging. Suzanne Collins does this in almost every chapter. She want you to keep on reading
B0011E7JBW|4.0|This is the best movie of the Trilogy. I loved Vincent Donofrio as the Bug. Too bad agent O was not in that movie
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|Rankin at his best! We once more are part of the Edinburgh crime scene and  meet  the familiar characters from previous novels.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Very good game.  Exercises your brain :)  I suggest it as a game for all adults.  Keeps the brain sharp.
B005HSL626|4.0|My niece absolutely loves them game, so I thought I would try it. I didn't think that I would like it, but I was surprised.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Haha if you are a pop culture person, you will lose your mind with this one. Between the Flash Gordon references and the family guy (duh) ones it really is a laugh a minute movie!
0062127241|5.0|I became infamous for smashing guitars onstage.<br />I composed TOMMY, the celebrated rock opera by The Who.<br />I used the synthesizer on &#34;Who's next&#34; in at least two different ways that are considered milestones for that instrument.<br /><br /> WHO I AM !
B007FEFLTO|4.0|A wonderful continuation of Follett's &#34;Fall of Giants&#34; (his absolute best writing, in my opinion). It doesn't have quite the impact of the &#34;Fall&#34; but is nevertheless very well worth reading. I would definitely recommend it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Interesting plot....well written. Moves along slower than I like. Main character becomes annoying and incredible.  Others that I have spoken with feel the same.
1452110581|5.0|Great humor and marvelous insight into human/cat relationships. So succinct!  A marvelous little treasure!  Give a copy to your cat-loving friends.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I do not believe a book with a great storyline.  Very credible.  Back story (re; Christian Gray's childhood) develops nicely throughout the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The best trilogy I have ever read! Impossible to put down. Such an amazing and vivid story. Perfect mix of romance, adventure, mystery, and horror.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't wait to start this book.  It is probably the best of the trilogy.  Lots of love, lots of action
B009VLX8FS|4.0|Not a bad song on the album, standard Taylor Swift style. Good price as well, thouroughly enjoyable to listen to
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Perfect ending to a long story of an exciting relationship.  Somewhat of a fairy tale ending, but I am not sure what would be a better ending
B004SYP5WC|5.0|I have always had trouble mailing bills on time.  Not now, u can set it too how many days to remind u to sent bill in.  not hard to input bills.  Very easy too use.
B005OCFHHK|4.0|This is a great value for getting a basic collection of all the movies. They are just the moves, no extras, which is all I wanted. All but the last three start playing without ads or menus.
1401324029|3.0|title says it all. but since i have to write 16 words in order to submit, guess I am done now.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Short and sweet little essay with some good basic points- nothing new here, but worth the read for the reminders.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|cast does a great job. would highly recommend for anyone who likes underdogs movies, or just wants to see actors playing something different than what you normally see them do now.
0307155102|5.0|I bought this for my twin grandsons.  We have a small copy of &#34;the word book&#34; which they want me to read every night at bedtime.  This larger book is wonderful. I am sure we will enjoy it for many hours.
B0021L8V0W|5.0|It has a great story line and Jolie is great in it.  I love to see strong women kicking ass!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I started reading, it was hard to put down!  Written extremely well.  I found myself squirming, jumping, and feeling awkward!  Can't wait to start book 2!
B0053O89JM|4.0|Although this last season was not one of the series' best, I still is very good.  Had to have it in order to complete our set.
B00447G2PM|5.0|If you love the ocean & every thing that lives in it, this is the 3D movie for.  Very entertaining.  Well worth the money
B00122O0V0|4.0|I purchased this item afterr hearing somr of the music on a tv show. I bought the album and i enjoy it.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|What I like best about this site is the diversity of jazz genres. What I often do when hearing a musician that I don't know is switch over to MOG, find albums for that musician, and often then listen to the entire discography.  This site by itself is great, although I do wish they'd offer a high stream rate. Combined with MOG, it's fantastic, although I also wish that MOG would offer a high stream rate as well. I have also begun to search for albums by new-to-me musicians that I discovered because of this site.
B005XN31LY|5.0|Can't wait for the new season.  It worked great on my kindle fire.  Its one of my favorites and I'm not able to watch it when it is on regular TV.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Great game, fun and addictive! Graphics are amazing and the game keeps your mind busy. Wonderful, relaxing game! Highly recommend to download!
B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I downloaded it ages ago on my phone after seeing my husband playing this on HIS phone. When I saw it available for my Kindle Fire, of course I had to get it. My 3 year old absolutely loves playing too......now every compatible device in our home has Temple Run on it.
B009YQJ322|4.0|Been reading 2000AD since it began, i grew up with ezequerra's hard as nails Dredd (apocolypse war, the cursed earth) so stallones dredd, ditching his helmet was a HUGE disapointment. But thank you Karl Urban(LOTR,chronicles of riddik,star trek,bourne ultimatium) for yet another stellar perfomance. He obviously read the comic . My only gripe is the movie is too short. Sequel please, the apocolypse war would be ideal
B009X01FJS|4.0|I would recomend it to anyone. The only down fall is to charge the kindle you have to leave the case open becuase the port is on the inside.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|its easier to use Facebook through the browser. the app freezes Will only let you see a few status updates. not worth it
B008WCP2PG|4.0|I gave it 4 stars for Channing Tatum, and the eye candy. The story line wasn't as good as I had hoped, but happy with my purchase none the less!
B002XTXG1G|5.0|I love this ridiculous movie..had a great storyline and fantastic humor...Tom hardy is superb both physically and mentally..love the behind the scene interviews..and supporting cast great job...
B004LWZWGK|5.0|We enjoyed this movie a lot.  It was a little slow like the first of the trilogy but very enjoyable.
B001M4YZ90|5.0|I've seen this movie when it first came out before Tom was famous and I didn't know him then but when I saw handsome bob I was like wow he is to fine lol..now later this year bought the DVD and fell in love with Tom hardy all over again..he was great in this along side the ever so hot Gerald butler and idris...a must see again and again...
B003YDUUHI|5.0|This is the best album that I've bough in a long time if not ever. Robbie Williams is such an incredible talent that if you don't care for one of his songs, wait for the next, because it will have a whole new sound. I've listened to this album (two discs are included) constantly now since I received it weeks ago and still absolutely love it. You will not be disappointed by this purchase. He sounds a bit like other pop greats like George Michaels, Pet Shop Boy and maybe even Justin Timberlake. His varied sounds and beautiful voice make it one of those albums you can just put in and enjoy to its entirety.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book within 24 hours. I couldn't put it down. I'm very pleased with the second book of the Hunger Games trilogy and cannot wait for the movie to come out. Now for book three :)
B005LAIHR2|5.0|Killer musical! Soundtrack was superb, the cast was great, and overall was a satisfying movie experience! Higly recommended for music buffs!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book it really good it pulls you has twists and turns you never can predict what will happen next I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read, but they would also had to of read the first Maze Runner book. Loved the book lots!!!
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I was originally introduced to the Twilight Saga series by a girlfriend, who finally convinced me to watch the first Twilight with her. I entered into the movie with a preconceived bias that the series was a teenybopper thing, but changed my mind during the viewing. Plot development was good, the setting (Pacific Northwest) was very suitable, and the characters were endearing in their own weird way. I am now a fan, and can't wait for the release of Breaking Dawn pt. 2. Good seres, I recommend it.
B005CRQ2DK|1.0|Really good book can't wait to read your next book!!!!!<br />I hope you come up with a next Edison of diary of a wimpy kid
B006MPKDUE|5.0|As an avid Michael Connelly reader I really like his books and this one is great. Go no further than Amazon for the latest books at the best prices.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book<br />I thought it was a very funny and amusing book to read. Also it didn't take very long either
B0099G3I96|5.0|Good to hear from No Doubt again. Fun album with a smooth sound. They haven't missed a beat! Long time fans will enjoy.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a very good book and I enjoyed it and it had a twist ending and I would.recommend.this book to anyone who like this type of.literature
B008NAFU9A|4.0|Started off slow at first and just when I was about to give up, the story picked up and I was carried away into Ophelia's world. I didn't care much for her accent but I found everything else enjoyable. I think Lenore would have to be my favorite character. Definitely recommend this book
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I choose this rating because it was a very good and touching book to read. There really wasn't anything I didn't like about the book, it was very consistent. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Especially those who are having a hard time with everyday life or death.
0545323126|5.0|I got this set for my friends daughter for her birthday and she loved them! I do not know any kids that do not love Diary of a Whimpy Kid, and the price I got on the set could not be beat!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think it's a great app. That's it. That's my review. I think it's a great app. Don't forget to request a game of Draw Something! Have a nice day!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|Not gross and not bloody!! Just good fun with excellent acting..I<br />would like to see more movies like this in the future....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Oh God. I finished this around midnight, after cracking up, crying, cracking up some more, and then completely bursting into tears. I'm really not sure how to describe this. What I liked was that the book felt... different. It's unlike every book I've ever read. I felt like the writing style kept changing, but I liked it. I really, really liked Isaac. The book would not have been the same without him. He could make me sob and laugh at the same time. I want to say more, but it's quite late, and I'm tired. Just read the godda~~ book, it'll cleanse your soul or whatever.
B00APUYWYA|1.0|Wow, it's been a long time since I've endured anything this bad. We started watching with 4 people, one left after 15 minutes, another in the next 15. I went to sleep (so hey, it was good for something!).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So totally awsome I cannot wait to read the next book omg I think I will go get it right now
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Very seldom do I listen to an album that does not have at least one or two tracks I just have to skip. I have been listening to this album front to back for months, I still have not gotten tired of it! If you like fun, energetic singalongs then you will probably like this album.
B009NX88JU|5.0|Thats why I had to rent this movie!! It wasnt on Netflix (which I pay for every month and hardly ever use it) and could just rent from Amazon..? Idk what I'm thinkin, right?? The movie was great, alot of new faves and the quality was excellant!! Will DEF rent from Amazon again, and probably THIS MOVIE!! lol Ahhhhhhhhhhh the 70's... ;)
0812550706|5.0|Ender's Game contains all the elements that contribute to an outstanding book. All of the characters are well developed, the suspense is well integrated and the plot is uniquely brilliant. The imagery in this book is also really impressive, especially in the 'Fantasy Game' but also in the other settings. As far as Science Fiction is concerned, the book is sorta outdated, however it is still a marvelous novel and I find it a pretty spectacular book considering when it was written.<br /><br />My only fault with the book was the age of all the characters. Though Ender, and the other characters have traits and attributions that resemble much older more mature individuals , the way they act and the things they achieve still add a daunting unrealistic front that is a little hard to swallow.<br /><br />Aside from that the book was fantastic and I would reccomend it to anybody. I read it in 2 days and enjoyed every moment of it because the author really is fantastic with accelerated plot.
B007Y36K46|2.0|[[ASIN:B007Y36K46 John Carter]]<br />Almost regretted the time, cost, and effort spent to watch this box office bomb from Disney. Fancy and over-the-top CGI can not rescue poor script, dialogue, and license with the written story. While the acting was barely acceptible, it seemed most of the actors suspected  that the script and lines were not good enough to draw out their best efforts. While the leading lady was pleasing eye-candy, I can understand why the movie bombed at the box office.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|This album is a fantastic collection of popular and non popular songs that a true fan will enjoy. Some might buy this and think there is a lot of filler but in reality these are great songs.
B008Y6UND6|5.0|A well written script whose main quirky character Lisbeth Salander is brilliantly acted by Rooney Mara.  A dragon tattoo on her back, pierced body earrings just about everywhere, a punk hairdo, black lipstick, she certainly commands attention.  Abused as a child, endowed with off the chart analytical skills and a photographic memory and also one mean bitch she is someone you don't want to cross.  Raped by her parol officer the scene where she gets revenge is unforgettable.  Mikael Blomkvist, played by Roger Craig, in my opinion the co-star, is Roger Craig,  We know who he is and what he is capable of.  The plot concerns a 40 year old apparent murder of a wealthy Swedish Industrialist niece.  His dysfunctional family gives us plenty of suspects.  Mikael (Roger Craig) well respected journalist is hired to uncover who done it and soon, with the help of Lisbeth, uncovers a sadist serial killer.  This movie is not for kids, but if you enjoy an intricate plot, brilliant cast and well acted -- don't miss it.  By the way this movie is the first of a trilogy.  All three books have been made into movies in Swedish -- the authors native language -- and also brilliantly acted and cast.  If you don't mind subtitles I also recommend those movies.  Stieg Larsson wrote the books and left us with some real thrillers before his untimely passing.
B007V65R54|4.0|Nate covered so MUCH it made my head spin.<br />He id one of the finest to sort through all of the crap we here and put it into terms a person like me can understand.<br />I am going to read it agian to figure out what I missed the first time as he covers so MUCH information, I know I missed some of it.<br />I hope he continues his endeavors to provide real facts to fiction.<br />Doug
B007N9FKCY|5.0|This game has many retro platformer qualities. The graphics sit somewhere between NES &amp; SNES quality. The music is very reminiscent of Megaman (which I love) and fits very well into the retro feel of the game. Aesthetics are great all around.<br /><br />Gameplay is slightly different from your traditional platformer. Your character, a young man changed into a jumping bean by an evil wizard, is perpetually jumping. This in my opinion is what makes this such an accessible platformer. Other touchscreen-only platformers are just hard to use because of all the necessary buttons. Gameplay in Bean's Quest doesn't have this problem because there is only a left and right button, and they are on opposite sides of the screen.<br /><br />Now, it would appear to be a boring platformer because you can't control when to jump. It actually adds complexity to the puzzle aspect of the game. While your main goal is to finish each level and eventually rescue your girlfriend from the evil wizard, each level has three specific challenges for you to complete: collect all gems, collect your cat/dragon (?), and complete the level within a certain number of jumps. This last one proved the most difficult for me, but all of them become troublesome by the end of World 6. These add a lot of replay value to the game.<br /><br />All in all, this game was fantastic. I would love a sequel and to be able to find the soundtrack somewhere. Definitely would recommend to those of us who were raised on classic platformers.
B00198X0VS|5.0|Men in Black series was and is still an extremely uplifting series of movies. Great to see it as a part of my UV collection now as well.
0415579872|2.0|It's a decent book to get you started using frames,but there is no way it is worth 40 bucks.  There are a lot of better books out there for less.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Men in Black series was and is still a very funny series. Glad to see it in my UV collection now.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book wasn't that bad . But it wasn't the best one I've ever.  Read I liked the first one better.<br /><br />.<br /><br />d
0316228532|5.0|I thought the book was great. Kept me interested as a reader and as someone who has experienced much of what was written about I can honestly say she hit the nail on the head. She had me laughing and crying. If you're someone who doesn't really enjoy books about things of a real life human nature then this isn't for you. But I still recommend everyone read this. It'll make you think twice about judging people prematurely.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Buy it, it is way better than my previous turtle beach x12's. Sound quality is amazing, voice morpher is fun as hell, and the batter lasts for 10 hours with only 2 hours to charge!!!!<br />Get it if you need a headset, worth the 120$ I paid for it.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|Nothing good to say about this one.  A seemingly interminable movie with an unfollowable plot, starring a guy who beats up his mother in real life.  Avoid this turd like the plague.
0385535147|5.0|Great entertainment, good characters, and quite a page-turner plotwise.  I was fooled in the beginning of where this was going but had a total turnaround.  Grisham never disappoints!
B0038OY6DW|1.0|If you want a real Sherlock adventure, try the new BBC show.  This may be one of the worst movies I've seen.  If it was a movie onto its own, it might have gotten 2 stars, but it's a travesty to what Sherlock Holmes should be
B00008J2PG|5.0|I enjoy learning and knowing that their are good people helping and caring for others. That sometimes their is truth .to bad evil still reigns.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|It doesn't give clear instructions so I'm really not sure what I'm supposed to be doing or how I'm supposed to go about it. And there are things it won't let you do unless you buy these jewels? I can see having them for sale for people who don't want to work at earning them but to make it so you can't do most of the activities unless you pay for these things? That's stupid. I got this game for my daughter, she LOVES My little Pony. We are both very dissapointed in this game.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I enjoy playing this game, it's challenging and fun!  I love to complete the levels and then go back and try to better myself.
B009KHDT0C|2.0|Terrible disappointment! Loved the original series, this was a bore.<br />One exception - Johhny Depp's acting was top notch as usual.
B0071MDA2U|5.0|spoilers from the first book in the trilogy<br /><br />This is an excellent second book in the trilogy. I loved the first and was drawn in, however I was devastated when Alex, the main love interest, was killed off. Lauren Oliver does a great job keeping the spirit alive and making me want to read more, even though I am a romance lover and Alex is gone. The ending is a surprising and absolutely wonderful twist, and I was literally shaking and fighting the urge to scream when I read it. This is a great book and a must read!!! I can not wait for the next book in the series.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Simple quick upload for selling and easy to search when buying! The icons and reminders are very helpful. As a non-ebay expert I now feel like a pro.
B00785P2QC|3.0|pretty good game for the most part I don't like you have to use money and the cash to buy land.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Unbelievable insight into a challenging time in America's history. So well written and puts the reader right on the Pacific Islands with the Marines. Most truly amazing is the fact that these survivors were able to come home and rebuild their lives. But still, they were never able to completely forget the horrific sights that remained etched in their minds. Thank you EB Sledge and all the WWII vets for your service to your country.
B008XG1X18|5.0|love using pinterest on my kindle!  very easy to use and pin from other websites.  love that I can either search for specifics or browse by category.
B0091LS07E|3.0|but the majority of her songs on this album are not memorable except for Girl on Fire. It is not as strong as &#34;Empire&#34;.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|love the game but bums me when I pick a tile and it doesn't react fast enough especially when every second counts
0810989956|5.0|This is the perfect way for boys to be able to express themselves without having a &#34;diary.&#34; It is really cute and asks some strange but funny things.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|An unrealistic story.  Maybe I'm just bitter because I am very unlucky in love.  Good if you just want a short romance story.
B007GEMQ2I|5.0|I purchased this for my 10 year son who is a lego fanatic. For some reason Amazon wouldn't post it so it was delivered to my sister in Vegas and flown out. This Town Hall is amazing, it took my son a day to build it and he has proclaimed that he will never pull it apart. The details are amazing and the building consists of three level with their own function. A wonderful addition to a lego collection, and although it says that it is for 14+ I think younger die-hard lego men will manage construction. This lego piece in Australia is $499.00, so Amazon please allow delivery to Australia as even with postage this is still a great deal - and I want to order some more!
B0086700CM|1.0|It doesn't work on my son's Nabi. Most times the swiping to turn won't work. It either jumps instead or nothing at all. Very disappointed child.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book.<br />Excited to read the next one. Makes me really excited about watching the movie. There Is Nothing I would change about this book!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 12 year old son.  Our whole family loves this game. At first I thought this game was a little expensive, but it is worth the money.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|I &#34;downloaded&#34; this to my Kindle Fire but the app never found its way to where i could play it but it say's it's in my library...haven't found it yet
0385360169|5.0|So sad it's over. All three books are definitely a must read. I recommend it but of course don't recommend it to teens.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great couldn't put it down. What aThrill ride. Hope the movie is just as good. Wish me luck reading the rest.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A lovely read with characters that are real and a story that keeps you interested from start to finish. Not just a bland romance novel as so many are. I also really enjoyed Colleen Hoover's other books. If you enjoy this book, you'll enjoy them too.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game works well with my Kindle Fire HD. This game is relaxing with great music and plenty of different levels to complete. Well worth it!
B0098VYKSA|4.0|This movie was exciting and held your attention. It was a movie that the family could enjoy in the comfort of your home.
0316120405|3.0|Rec. book on time - have not read yet!  need eleven more words  -  need seven more words  -  two more then  LIFT OFF
B009329ZF2|4.0|This movie was full of action and had a good story line. I enjoyed the action. Fun to watch.  I would recommend this movie to others.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I absolutely love it! This game is extremely fun and entertaining!It almost comes close to rivaling the SIM City games.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My son loves playing with these puzzles - it took him no time at all to figure out how to drag the pieces.  He sits and giggles in his carseat when he finishes because he loves spinning the puzzles around and around.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|This is an enthralling book. Highly recommended if you enjoyed Lord of the Rings, A Game of Thrones or The Kingkiller Chronicles. I know there are a ton of fantasy books out there, but as someone who's read a lot of them - this is one of the best there is.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Listening to this cd on repeat. Every song is great! Only disappointment is there are only 10 songs! Love Bruno!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|There is honor, passion and nobility - qualities i highly appreciate.<br />There is generosity, mercy and love - qualities i aspire to.<br /><br />The book touched me and will hopefully hold me for a long time.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I was duped into renting this movie. It is animated and silly. I would not recommend this to anyone above the age of 6.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Hes not only an accomplished actor hes a genius musician! I miss House and found a boxed set of House (sorry before i found Amazon)...lol. But i found 2 Diary kids movies (sons birthday) Clint Eastwood in a baseball movie. A kid who grows from the ground apparantly named Timothy Green for my wife and several cheap Billy Joel cds for dad who is a music freak and 2 NCIS cd soundtracks that completed this great day! Amazon made this happen who could ask for anything more? Me ive got more items coming. I got the new items like the new Pink cd the final Transformer movie and Captain America and Thor! And still more coming cant wait for Friday and Saturday!!
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Having read the book series, I was interested to see how the movie would play out. I have to say it was pretty close and the movie characters were lose to how the book describes them. Great movie for young teenagers.
1451695195|3.0|There was only a small portion of the book on heaven and most I couldnt understand what he was saying I was looking for comfort since my daughter just went to heaven and I didnt get it. I guess I was looking for more wish I could have understood it more<br />Thank you
B007UXSPK2|5.0|If you like Tom Cruise and the whole Mission Impossible series, you will love this movie. I highly recommend it.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This book was very enlightening. Americans need to know how our government's actions impact the world. It is a wonder we have made it this far.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I was hesitatnt at first to rent this movie, but I thought I would give it a try. I enjoyed the twist from the original Disney movie.
B003B02O14|4.0|Really likes the novel.  Kept me reading well into the night.  I look forward to more from John Grisham.  Four Stars!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|good story line, keeps me reading towards the end. Now i'm looking for another book as good as this one.
B00AJRQLTI|3.0|If you like the movie, you'll like this soundtrack. Personally it's a bit of a miss compared to the cast recordings: vocal performances weaker and fewer songs...
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I'm pretty sure amazon put this for free on christmas as a present to us all.  Suuuuch a good game.  I own it on PC as well.
B0041KW076|5.0|the scope the feel, the beauty of a RECORD ... wonderful .. wish I could afford the all!!!!  Looks like not so many still available one a time ... did send out two a gifts, those who got them were DELIGHTED!!!  Beyond that really!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I got this movie as a Christmas gift for my dad. I definitely recommend it to any adventure movie lover. It is both clever and exciting!
B009O2XY12|2.0|Its ok just not what I expected It would be could to pass the time but no real challenge but it was free so that a plus
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I ordered this movie for my dad for Christmas. It is a good movie for a variety of audiences. It's exciting, fun, and even humorous. I definitely recommend it.
1935182617|3.0|The book is written fine (their Web site is even better). However, before anyone decides to use iText I strongly recommend to read their licensing rules. I just found out it's actually not \\"free and open source library\\" as they announce (see the book review) and what my understanding of free and open source means or as it's described in freeBSD license. iText rather has a so called \\"GNU Affero General Public License version 3\\" which is designed to prevent the proprietary commercialization of Open Source code.

B0098VYCCE|4.0|I am normally not into this kind of movie, but I will have to say, I enjoyed it! I rented this movie for the grandkids and I  like the fact that this movie has very little profanity which is very unusual these days. Evil forest, fairy forest, good vs. evil battles and it actually has a good &#34;storyline&#34; which is also unusual for this type of movie. I do recommend!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was especially meaningful for me, having worked in the science field.  I'm also ordained clergy and reading the author's experiences gave new meaning to my faith life.  I recommend this book especially for those who are skeptics.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|As always, Meryl Streep is amazing.  This movie was funny and enjoyable, which is exactly what we were looking for.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Absolutely Unbelievable! I suggest you watch it with subtitles the first time, because she's quite hilarious, but her accent is quite thick, & I missed comments without the subtitles. You ALSO get a CD of the songs she sings in the concert - some of which are covers, making this a valuable addition to your Adele collection - especially since we don't know when she'll put out another CD!
B0064Z62R0|5.0|I love Hawaiian music and the variety on this CD is awesome.  I listen to it whenever I want to relax and think about being in beautiful/warm Hawaii.
B000I2J0W4|5.0|Alright, this film version of the best selling Stephen King novel is not very faithful to the book, however, it has Jack Nicholson, who gives an over-the-top performance that makes this film five stars.  Stephen King was so unhappy with the interpretation, that he later made a made-for-TV remake with Stephen Weber and Rebecca de Mornay years later.  Comparing the two, both have their moments and stronger points.  The centerpiece of this version is the writer Jack Torrence played by Nicholson and of course, the beautiful Overlook Hotel and its scenary. Slowly Nicholson succumbs to Cabin Fever and with this &#34;shining&#34; ability, is seduced by the hotel management to do some terrible deeds.  The most outlandish scene is Jack and Wendy on the stairs with the bat, which is brilliant.  Instead of animal topiary and the evil playground, we get the hedge maze. The animals were better.  The final scenes are truly scary stuff with Wendy walking through the cobwebed halls, skeletons, and a river of blood.  Classic horror from the master directoy Stanley Kubrick.  I highly recommend all of Kubrick's films, and this is no exception.  This review is on the now discontinued HD DVD standard by Toshiba.  It is a shame this format died off ,as it is just as clear as Blu Ray, but lost the format war to Sony.  In this HD DVD transfer, the image quality is absolutely breathtaking.  The actors stand out on the screen.  When Wendy is smoking a cigarette, the smoke and embers looks entirely real!  If you still have a compatible player, it is worth finding this gem if available.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton's books are always enjoyable.  I found this one suspenseful to the end, and very enjoyable to read.  I'd recommend it for a time when you need to escape and relax into another world for a little while.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Borrowing from the Zombie Culture of Romero's Night of the Living Dead and based on the comic of same name, this is Zombie horror at its best. Season 2 includes the same cast from Season 1, with some excellent additions such as Herschel and Maggie.  There is a sub-plot tension of a love triangle between Lori, Rick and Shane which boils to a zombie fiesta conclusion.  The best episode of the series is the one where the barn door comes open.  Excellent acting by the leads, Andrew Lincoln especially good.  The music is excellent as well, complementing the tension.  I am reminded at times of the &#34;Left for Dead&#34; game series by Valve, especially in Season 1 when Daryl says concerning his brother, that he was &#34;left for dead&#34;.  The Blu Ray transfer is fine, not as crisp as some of the best transfers I have seen,  but above average. The extras are also fun to watch and are a good addition. If you are a zombie fan, this is a must have!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|JUST NOT FUNNY.  FOUL LANGUAGE DID NOT HELP AT ALL!  MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER TO GEAR IT TOWARD CHILDREN INSTEAD OF ADULTS.
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|The opening episode &#34;Days Gone By&#34; sets the stage for the best zombie series to ever hit the small screen. The opening is an idea stolen from 28 Days Later, where the hero wakes after a Zombie Apocolypse devistates the world. In this case, it is deputy sherriff Rick Grimes, who learns of the fate of this family and friends throughout the first season.  The horse and tank scene is classic!  Excellent support from a fine supporting cast.  The final episode is explosive to say the least, with the CDC doctor sharing a secret with Rick the viewer does not learn about until the end of season two.  Highly recommended!
0679905278|5.0|My wife and I decided to purchase a copy of this book after reading about parents who let their children's teachers sign and write notes to their child each year throughout school, then present the book as a gift at graduation.  This sounded like a great idea and since it was to be a gift 18 years from now (we have a 5 year old and twin 3 year olds) we decided to purchase the &#34;Library Binding&#34; version.  The books are great and glad that we spent the extra money to get the better quality!
B00APUQH0W|4.0|Love all the actors in this movie and of course the content and emotions were great!  We really enjoyed our evening.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a reread and every bit as good as the first time.  All her books are well worth reading.  Its exciting to find her books.
0399103422|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to read about the movie I've seen so many times.  It is a great read and worth it for anyone who really loves this movie.
0394721772|5.0|I had bought one copy realizing that it was a soft cover so I went back and ordered the hardback.  The softback is used for cooking and the other for display.
B005LAIISU|3.0|I have to say, this is probably my least avorite Ice Age movie, but the kids seem to really like it.
B009329Y30|5.0|This movie was really good! The characters were believable. It impacted me even more since a friend of mine is in the army
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a highly addictive game if you like solving puzzles. I have it loaded on all my portable devices.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Simple, fun, silly, and intuitive. One of my favorites for android, linux, and PC.<br />Pros: its easy to use, entertaining, great on touch screen devices.<br />Cons: none.
1594489505|5.0|If you want to really open your eyes about the Afghan culture, you must read this. Through the life stories of two women, oppressed and almost murdered, we get an unforgettable portrait of what it's like to be female in this sad culture of ignorance.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|I preferred the plot of the original movie with actual portrayal of Mars residents & mutants. This show was too dark...unfortunately, that seems to be the popular style for modern science fiction movies.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Really liked. A lot of running back and forth. Kept me busy. Looking forward to second one. Thanks Big Fish for another great game.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|My boys love this movie. I love how the movie takes you back in time and is truly a good clean movie.
B007I1QUYE|5.0|it met my expectations... had no problems with my order.... it was a gift for my daughter... she was happy
B0061S073A|3.0|I really like the idea behind this app, a separate space for kids apps which I can set use limits and permissions. But every time you hit the home icon from any of the kids games or apps, it takes you to a warning screen then does a couple redirects and finally back to the Kids Place dashboard. It is really clunky and not well integrated. So i'll give three stars because they are on the right track but they have plenty of room for improvement.
B000N6UERK|5.0|it met my expectations... had no problems with my order.... it was a gift for my husband... he was happy
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Great selection of the best music from the show. Good variety of songs and performers to match your listening mood.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This was great to read. It kept interested at all times. For those who want to give up .. . Don't . . .read this book first. It gives one hope.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|It was good. Since I'm in school it's very useful.I would recommend it to someone.The only thing that I didn't like was the fact that you can't pick a letter page to go to.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I love puzzle games, and this one is very fun and has a weird story line too. I would recommend it to others that enjoy puzzle games such as fantastic contraption
B009VLX8FS|5.0|love all songs by Taylor Swift in this album.  The Amazon cloud has also made it easier to store and listen to.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I really like this game.  It is so much fun!  The only thing I wish the developers would change about it is making it easier to add friends to play with.  I would also like to see them add the random village option back in.  Without friends to play with,  It makes it very hard to complete many tasks in the game because of needing pink heart currency that a player can only get from his or her friends.  If these changes are made.  I would give this game a 5 star rating.  The game has interactive mini games within the overall big game that are very cute.  players can actually play catch with the ponies of ponyville.  Building your own ponyville is a neat process.  I like the fact that the different characters talk in the game too.  If you or your children are a fan of this show.  This is a really great game to play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good read<br />I love when a movie is much better then the movie. I would recommend this book to others
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It is fun to play. Not easy to win. Can make you late for appointments, will keep you up up at night.
B0024396WE|5.0|Great historical movie everyone should watch, awesome for family viewing, Schinder's List deserved every award it received...One of the best movies ever made about World War ll
140053271X|5.0|It great for what I use it for. To read books. They say the battery life would last over a month, but I haven't been able to go that long.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|hope there is more loved this one maybe this is not your average read but very interesting, thought it was great
B00APUYN0I|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie, I was pleasantly surprised and entertained. It's worth the time if you're looking for a good laugh.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|glad there was #3 looking for more hope she keeps writing,gination thought these were great love stories very interesting ima
B008L1DNGI|2.0|I like retro graphics but this one is missing a lot of elements that games have come to include. The user feedback is clunky and it feels like they simply got it to run on Android and changed nothing.<br /><br />FREEZES ON GALAXY NOTE 2 IF THE SCREEN TIMES OUT.
B004ZQRJFO|5.0|I purchased the Hell: The sequel C.D for my son as he really enjoys this music He is happy with it
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Great movie, full of jokes. The plot isn't the greatest, but the conept of the film and the delivery of the jokes is nothing but hilarious.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|This movie was SO not what I was expecting. I am old enough to remember the TV show this movie was based on, so I was afraid that they were trying to do a serious take on the show, but by replacing the leads with Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill. Had they done that, this movie would have been absolutely terrible. But they didn't. What they did instead was take a more tongue in cheek approach to the remake, one where they weren't afraid to poke fun at themselves. The result is one riotous good time! Seriously!<br /><br />I won't go into my favorite jokes because they might not be as funny out of context, or worse, they might ruin something for you, but if you're looking for a good time, then you should definitely check this out! It's action, it's adventure, it's fun, it's friendship, and it's worth it!
B008JAG2AA|3.0|The movie doesn't break any new ground. It doesn't really furhter the lives of the characters. All in all its a okay movie nothing special and exactly what you'd expect for an American Pie film.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Really fun read. Works well to go back in time with a cold case to mix with present tense bad guys. You will enjoy it for sure.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I have always enjoyed Kelly. I think this is her best CD yet. She has an excellent voice and can appeal to all ages from &#34;baby boomers&#34; and below.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|It was fun to see some big name stars.  Definately a chick flick but U already knew that.  It was predictable but I enjoyed it on a rainy evening.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I enjoyed listening to this CD. It's a different kind of music. Phillip is one of a kind. He can take any song and make it his own. It's relaxing to me and I would highly recommend to the &#34;baby boomers&#34; and below.
030758836X|5.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the entire read.  There were so many twists and turns.  The writing is fabulous.  Recommend this one for sure.  No question. Get it!
B007HO392S|5.0|I have always loved Carrie since she won on American Idol. This is not one of my favorite CDs because it's more rock but it's clearly Carrie. I would highly recommend to anyone that likes Carrie's other CDs.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Its great and go got it at a good price, I looked for it local but did not find it and I recived it sooner than I thought
B002LMV7TS|5.0|Awesome show,  It's better then the cartoon.  It's a show you could watch over and over again!  Trust me I have, my kids love it!!!!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game is very fun and well thought out. Unlike typical games for mobile devices this game is unique and never feels repetitive. It is definitely worth the price since it offers much more than other games. It's like a physics bridge game that tells a story.
1439170916|5.0|This book has all that I appreciate in non-fiction books plus a high dose of human empathy written with no condescension and a lot of clarity. Need I say more. It is the most optimistic piece of writing I've read in years.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Feel the pain in the music an the excitement in the beats. I really enjoyed the mp3 album for 5 dollars and the Amazon cloud player lets me take Lana del Rey everywhere I want.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Always enjoy Nora Jones music- just got this one for a stocking stuffer & was very glad that I did.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is really fun once you get to the more challenging levels. Just don't give up on it too soon! I'm glad I gave it a chance.
B005ZUR724|1.0|game is awesome but consider this... i paid for app and suscription, update comes out and cant even update it on my kindle so i cant play because amazon hasn't updated it, so tnx to that I have an app that used to be fun... now its just for decoration...
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Ordered this on cyber Monday. The songs are great!! I love her voice it sounds different in ever song. Love this artist.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|gave me a virus so i got rid of it. Want to get trend micro when i get the money.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|&#34;It's a Wonderful Life,&#34; is a great classic and I do think every family should have it in their DVD library.
B0086700CM|4.0|it keeps u on the ball<br />it is fun<br />it is a lot of fun to play..i like it a lot
0517548232|3.0|This is an interesting read and reflects the perspective of the author in its title, &#34;Economics in One Lesson . . . &#34;
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Always anxiously awaiting a new Pendergast book, this one didn't disappoint.  A gripping read through and through, leaving the door open for the next installment, coming soon, I hope!
B003R4ZMJU|5.0|This dvd set is awesome!! It came in a timely manner and everything. I'm purchasing all the seasons from amazon when they come out.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Warning this game can be addicting. I finished all the puzzles and then reloaded the game to start again. I also purchased the color version.
B0086700CM|5.0|Very fun game! Takes a moment to learn and several attempts to master. I'm looking forward to getting the high score over and over again!
B004G8QHKO|4.0|I totes love this band, the best song is &#34;Girls like You&#34;. There's a lot of bass so be wary<br />Great tracks and a great buy
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Who wouldn't love Rod Stewart? His voice is as good as it ever was. This album is a spruced up version of the ole hum drum versions of Christmas songs.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Love Mumford, one of the greatest sounds and pure music out there.<br /><br />This album is very familiar with their first so don't expect anything different than their classic banjo, drum, harmonica sounding-ness. However, they do it well.
030759565X|5.0|I gave this to my cousin for Christmas and she absolutely loved it!  Will definitely be buying one for myself!
0345534379|4.0|I purchased this book as a gift for a tween boy thinking it would be a paperback version of the large, full-color Guinness books released each year.  It is still a very interesting read, but if you're looking for lots of photos and fun text, you'll want the hardcover version.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|If you are looking for a laugh this is great!  Not an Oscar winner but funny and entertaining, I will totally watch again!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Was a very good and almost a great movie.  This item makes a great gift for someone who loves mysteries.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|Up front I will admit Wes Anderson can do no wrong in my eyes. Sweet story, great visuals, amazing soundtrack. I could copy and paste that sentence in a review for all his movies.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I had recently read a book about mnemonics and memorization, and ended up coming across this book after watching Kevin Rose's Foundation videos. Tim Ferris clearly and concisely presents the information in such a way that you can open it up at any point and find something useful or interesting. The first two parts of the book do the bulk of the explaining in terms of how to effectively approach learning and then the rest is him following through by using cooking and a few other things to provide a real example. It's easy/enjoyable to read, and it's easy to apply what you learn from the book in everyday life.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|I'm so glad I bought this album instead of the newest one. It has more hits than her new one-of course that's my opinion. It's unfortunate that I was introdruced to her music due to her passing. I liked only a few songs but since her passing I've enjoyed basically all her music. May she Rest in Peace.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|does exactly what is says and exactly what I wanted it to do.  If you want music you have to pay.  Free is great!
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love playing any Dinner Dash game. Never have had a problem with any of the<br />games. Dinner Dash games will always have 5 stars from me.
B008L1PYQU|3.0|Only a collector item. The cover is the only thing good. I got Vinyl and CD just because I'm a KISS fan.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fun, simple game! Anyone can play! Have a great time now,by down-loading and playing this fun and simple game! Don't wait! Do it now!
B000YHG72E|4.0|Silly story fun to watch with my kids.  Exactly the kind of silly physical humor you would expect from Will Ferrell.  Enjoyable and not serious.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This album blew me away!! Reminds me Natasha Beddingfields sound. BRAVO! It is so much more than country, this is Taylor Swifts first adult ablum, no more kid stuff. 5 stars Miss Swift. Ill be waiting to see what you do with the next one!
B00AMBH70S|1.0|1st movie redone with a new lead character.  Nothing surprising or terribly engaging.  Same themes rehashed. Don't waste your time.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evermore to keep track of stuff I would normally have scattered all over.<br />I keep track of app. times or address to a job and when I am done it is easy to clean up un needed things.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This set comes with a cheap booklet that is glued to the outside of the box and does not fit inside the box.  The discs themselves come in a single thick case.  There is no artwork and such within the case.  Disappointing considering how good the movies are.  5 star for the quality of the movies.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Ugh. This film was weak in all areas except special effects which is/are the \\"star\\". It all starts and ends with a tedious script and storyline. Can't do much if the writing has no wit etc. The main bad guy, Bane, is just boring, especially his annoying Darth Vader voice/Hannibal rip off mask etc., These guys shouldn't talk a lot but this one does. The good/bad girl is hot of course, and possibly the best acting with weak lines. Nolan, normally superb, is equally flat and his bad boy voice is just as annoying as Bane's. One of those films you might play in the background while dusting ir whatever. What a waste of, no matter doubt, millions of dollars.
B004UG7RQ0|4.0|This is a good product for the price.  There is a continuous buzzing that I can only hear when close to the speakers and they are not playing anything (note I use this with the Bose Sound Dock 1).  I also could not hook these up to my computer without a very loud noise coming from it  (I'm not sure if this was the problem or not).  In my experience with it I can say it works well with MP3 players and Xbox 360 (using a component to 3.5mm stereo conversion cable).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|this is a great book - enjoyed it very much...I am anxiously waiting for the next one to come out
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I went through it and it actually made better than a real dictionary ;) I really do like it .
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Played the Wii version, it is just as fun on your phone and more convenient to play anywhere you are.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|very challenging, excellent graphics. it takes getting use to but once you start you can't put it down. a must have.
B002X4OKRK|4.0|I love the original Gene Wilder version, and I really liked this version. The music was way more cool and didn't feel like a cheesy musical. My wife is a die-hard original fan, and wanted nothing to do with the remake.  My kids love both.
B009329Y30|5.0|I was anxious to watch the movie as I had just finished the book.  I enjoyed it, though the book was better!
0966638328|5.0|Muy buen producto, estoy satisfecho con la compra y lo recomiendo. Buen envio y rapido vale lo que compre gracias
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This product is wonderful the for Star Wars fan, all 6 episodes + 3 bonus discs. This product was shipped, deliverd, and received perfectly, just as expected.  It was a thrill for my grandson.
B00886XQO0|5.0|This is a very good headset with an incredible sound. It's also very comfortable and light. You feel like in a battlefield when you play!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game from kids to Mom :)  It was a free download and a fun yet challenging game.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|I am only though three chapters it is hard to follow along as the words flow by too quickly. I would like to be able to get the whole story.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is perfect for beginners and veterans because of the many different settings it can be so easy even my 4 year old sister could play it
B009GED3HS|5.0|I love this show and applaud it for being truly great comedy. This season is even better than last season!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Some of the parts were funny and the singing was okay.  I have seen better on Glee.  The story line was weak also !
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|It was a great movie and CD but without Come to Me and Who am I it is really incomplete
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved everything about this book. Couldn't put it down. Would recommend it to anyone that loves romance. Love love love
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I thought that being on kindle fire it would be slower or it would be harder to place and upgrade towers, but the transition from Pc to kindle was almost flawless. It does start to lag about wave 100 tho, but you are warned about that early on.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works great and very smooth graphics and handling easy for any one to use I give it 5 stars all the way
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|i got this for my daughter to play and i now have become obessessed!! i deleted the first app because my daughter didnt play it right and i wanted to start my own land!! the issue i have is it doesnt give you enough coins to start with and im not the type of person to spend money on games when it could be used for something else.. but overall great game!!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|Picture is always upside down, no matter how you turn the screen..uninstalled it immediately. Hope they can fix it because it seems pretty cool
B005K17RU0|1.0|I did not like this product.  It did not meet my needs but was not worth the hassle of returning.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|I am new to the kindle fire HD and I am not having good luck with some of these apps! They're upside down and I can't keep them upright unless I lock the screen. So I go to use the camera and it photographs me upside down. Pretty frustrating....
B003SI3URQ|4.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B000006OBQ|5.0|This is a great release of a super classic Sinatra show. To me, it is a must have in the music collection
B00A757EFW|4.0|Thouh it is a simple finger tip control, the reaction time of either me or my kindle is too slow so I dont get much past the first round
B004GYY714|1.0|I did not like this product.  It did not meet my needs but was not worth the hassle of returning.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|As the title implies, this next installment of the Bourne collection is similar to the Jason Bourne trilogy, and includes great action sequences that keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more throughout most of the movie.  Aside from the traditional car chases, fist fights, and shooting, the first part of the movie jumps around enough to keep you guessing about how all the disparate scenes tie together.  By mid-movie, you have a pretty good idea of the plot and how it will unfold.  By the end, you wish the plot had developed much further.  The movie does a great job of setting up the next few movies from the Bourne franchise by leaving you with more questions than answers.  If you liked the first three movies, you'll love this one.  If not, you won't.
B0063IH60K|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.

1594202842|5.0|I loved this book. My (white) husband and I (Chinese American) read through it together and just loved at the hilarity of each story, because it was a lot like how my mom raised me (and he knew it). Although I was never pushed to extremes (in fact, my parents didn't understand why I wanted to practice the flute so much since they didn't see it as a money making future), I was always seeking my mother's approval (which seemed like something I could never get).<br /><br />Anyways, we just started our own family and will need to decide how we want to parent. Tiger Mom has some really good lessons that we will incorporate, like not letting your kids give up so easily, and how American parenting can sometimes be 'too lax.' Extremes aren't the way to go, but this fun book will keep you wanting for more. Amy's courage is impressive, not only in the way she chose to raise her daughters (who she clearly loves and hopes they will love her in return despite her extreme parenting behaviors), but also in sharing her story.<br /><br />If you're looking for more reviews on motherhood books, visit the website, AllMomsArePerfect.com.
B0086700CM|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Just like his other books this one takes off right from the start. Chapter one grabs you and keeps your eyeballs transfixed on the pages for hours (no, dangit, not only on chapter one!  what is wrong with you?  :-)  ----).  Character development is very Stephen King-esc (thorough, inviting, likeable but not all &#34;Tom Clancy&#34;-ish where one complete chapter is dedicated to describing a pimple on an arm, but don't get me wrong, I LOVE Tom Clancy too! ), plot develops faster than poop through a goose, chapters are just long enough to get you interested in reading on and on and on and on and on and on------------------<br />Blake's writing style is creative without being boring or too lengthy. The settings are familiar and you can truly &#34;see&#34; the story in your mind as it develops and weaves its way through the multifaceted locations.  I am convinced you will like this book......
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|I did not like this product.  It did not meet my needs but was not worth the hassle of returning.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as good as the first two books. This one started out slow.but still a good book to read a
B008K9UZY4|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This really is a great game for the price.  Runs wonderfully of my Kindle Fire HD.  Graphics are really good for a tablet game, though the draw distances are a bit short.  Game play is fast paced and fun
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B007HACDLK|3.0|An OK read, but predictable, barely worth the time &: rather far fetched would not buy again, not worth the effort
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Entertaining, although rather far fetched with an indestructable one man team that is almost pathetic in the circumstances he creates
B005COO1X6|5.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I never thought that I would be able to self publish simply because I am not a computer savvy individual. With the Kindle self-publishing guide however it doesn't get any easier. Instructions are crystal clear. A highly accessible guide (especially for us low tech learners). I  actually enjoyed the entire process. Thank you for a truly rewarding experience!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|These are the only brand I will use.  They give me just what I need and I will continue to use them in the future.
B00190KZUU|5.0|It's a very interesting well thought out movie. It's not about a Big Fish but I don't know why anyone would not like this movie
B00004WG2F|3.0|Just did not realize it was coming from the US, so it won't work in my dvd/blueray-will in my laptop.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I give Dragon Vale four stars because the graphics are amazing, the dragons are well thought out and its fun watching them evolve maybe in the future we can have more interaction with our dragons.  I would love to be able to get gems for free, I understand they have to make money for their product and I  have purchased some items in the game BUT only if it's reasonable! I would give five stars for dragonvale if they keep their items cheap and if they gave us the option to play without the internet!!
B007UXSPK2|2.0|too corny.. too many buddy scenes.. it was a big yawn.  action scenes were neat not enough to carry the mushy bull crap.
B001QKSWOE|5.0|Janet can really keep you going back to book.  It is hard to get anything done because I want to find out what happens next.
1416960953|4.0|Nice book for spiderwick fans, but I was expecting, by the look of the book, that the bands and seal actually closed the book, but they are just printed on the cover.  Would have been cooler that way!
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I am not a really big fan of hunger games but i am a little young-pretty girl__<br /> yeah thats me
B00005JNS0|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT.  WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS.  WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I have read in a while! I definitely recommend this book to teenage Girls and adults, loved it
B0034G4P80|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT.  WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS.  WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book really makes you realize how amazing life is even through the trials and tribulations. Everyone should take the time to read this truly gorgeous piece of writing.
B004EPZ07K|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT.  WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS.  WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?
B004IFYN2E|4.0|In this film you don't need to sit at the edge of the chair, but at the end you are totally surprised
B003Y5H5AG|5.0|GREAT PRODUCT.  WHY DO i HAVE TO WRITE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF WORDS.  WHY CAN'T I JUST RATE WITH THE STARS?
B009JBZH54|4.0|The action was enough to keep you interested to the end.  The special effects are fair for this kind of picture.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Very nice video. This was a purchase for my husband. He enjoyed the series very much. I puchased this along with the complete series dvd.
B0021L8V0W|4.0|In spite that it raises many questions, the film keeps you waiting for the unexpected, and you don't guess what.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This was a tv show that I wish would have continued. Interesting characters, good story lines. My husband really enjoyed this show. I ordered the Serenity movie at the same time.
B002ZG99NG|3.0|In spite of the action, the film was somehow boring and without any clear logic, I still do not have clear what was the real importance of the girl who was the first bank's manager.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Looks better than the iPhone version and does everything that this wonderful program does. Brings reading and taking notes together.
B000N6UERK|4.0|It has some sci-fi in the background, but it complies with the thriller standards. Denzel Washington as good as always.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Wish it was longer and we could see them have a baby!! A second book to this would have been great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I thought I wouldn't love this game as much as I do now as I did then I can't quit playing its so addicting
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|It's predictable, but funny. You should watch it with a big group of friends to get the most out of it.
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|Guess I'm bored with the whole zombie thing - maybe they hired welfare make up artists. Nice to see the hot girls but the anti-gun bit with Michelle, really? Hollywood d-bag writers.
B0084IHVC0|5.0|Ya just can't beat a Disney movie! They are the best! Amazon made it so easy to give as a Christmas gift! And I didn't have to worry about trying to find it in a store or have to deal with the crowds!
B000MPEIF6|4.0|Milla is the zombie killing queen. This flick was her boot drive. She can jump in my shower anytime. Where can I get one of those dogs?
0786891416|3.0|I started reading a couple chapters and for some reason never finished. I love the tv show Castle and thought I wouldn't be able to but the book down but I have after two or so chapters. It reads very simiar to the show but I didn't get into it. Might finish it might not. Guess I won't be getting the next book in the series.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Great movie, crystal-clear on Blu-Ray. Kind of disappointed in the lack of extras, though. Could have done without the 3-D version for some additional special stuff.
B004M3GDI4|5.0|I got this as a gift for my father for Christmas from my brother and I.  All I can say, is that he LOVES the little thing, and says he can see better now with MORE range than ever before.  The different settings with the changing lumens is exactly what he needed, and got!<br /><br />He hinted at us a couple months back he could use a nice headlamp.  I was completely uneducated as to what was a \\"good\\" headlamp.  After doing some \\"Amazonial\\" research, it seems that Petzl is THE brand to go with!  My father so far is in 100% agreement with this statement!
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|Actually, I don't know whether the problem is this app or the Kindle Fire onboard lens, but it seems to take a very grainy and low quality photo.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Excellent book with ever witty acid tongued Corey delivering pearls of joy.  We hope to see more in<br /><br />This series soon
B006KX3GXO|1.0|No matter how I turn the kindle fire, the camera takes an upside down image, and flipping/rotating editing features are not intuitive.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I wasn't impressed with Taylor Swift's previous albums but I really, really enjoy Red. This isn't my usual music choice but I was able to get it for free, so I thought I would I check it out. I am normally a fan of the hardcore scene but I do listen to other genres and really love Paramore. This album reminds me, in a way, of Hayley Williams' sound. Taylor's voice is much more mature in this album and that is great! This is one of the best albums of 2012.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This was a thoroughly exciting book with plenty of twists and turns that kept me rapt.  I stayed up until 3:30 am to finish it last night.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|As inappropriate as this is, you wouldn't expect to like it, but that is just not the case. I never stopped laughing, and I am sure I will laugh just as hard when I go back and watch it again. Instant classic.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Credit to Drew Barrymore for her performance in a Cinderella role. This one is a gem of a story, beautifully told. The inclusion of Leonardo da Vinci as a quirky senior inventor and friend adds a light-hearted note to the film.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|the movie would be great if the dvd played well. I would like to get the dvd replaced by the company if possible
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a totally charming film with a superb cast. Though it appeals most to those retired or soon facing retirement, it has universal appeal. The characters are quirky; their needs are basic. Finding themselves outsourced to India to live out their lives, they have to adapt not only to their new environment, but to their over-the-hill status. It's heart-warming and entertaining.
B0087YYHZU|4.0|Great version for good price.  The extras were not too exciting, mostly just glee actors talking about how singing in the rain affected their lives.  Not too interesting for die hard fans.  I would rather have seen a backstory on Debbie Reynolds or some screen tests.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Such a wonderful classic! I think this is a good read for everyone. And it is nice that I could find such a good, free version.
B0058YPG1G|4.0|Great this seams to just get better cant stop watching this. I would say this could be one of the beast.
B008L1DNGI|1.0|So many great puzzle games these days. This was of no interest and quickly got deleted. Others loved it but not my cup of tea.. But I didnt grow up with this and have plenty of other challenging puzzles already. Don't need to add another one unless it's great and I know I will use it regularly
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book. I don´t to spoil it for you, but the first part is a bit slow, but once you get to the story on the second and third parts, you will not be able to put it down. Last 20 pages are incredibly well written and, believe me, you will be surprised at the end :)
B002BWP49M|5.0|Was a gift for my Granddaughter. She loves all the movies But this one was her favorite. something she can watch over and over
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This book is ok. It can be a bit pretentious and repetitive. It is like reading a soap opera where teenagers think like 55 year olds. With all that said, it is short and reads fast, you can nap/read and even skip parts and you will still get it, so it makes a good read when you are on vacations or just don’t feel like reading a challenging book.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Excellent movie, hats off to Christoper Nolan<br />Fitting end to the series directed by him<br />I will be buying this movie for multiple viewing
B003O86FMW|5.0|If you haven't read this trilogy you must today. It's a can't put it down series with a really new story.
B001S2PT3M|5.0|Got a great deal on this set! It is one of the best series I have ever seen! :) :)
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you read the other two books in this series there is no way you can't read this one, but read the them in order.
0743487486|5.0|Recommend this Amazing book to any parent of any-age child, and to teachers!  And really, to anyone who wants healthier human relationships.  It is revolutionary.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this has every city I want.  So I can see what I need to pack when I go see family.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|You know how some things look good in a picture and when you get it you are disappointed.<br />This will not disappoint you.
B006ZS4FE8|5.0|Granddaughter hooked on the &#34;Lego Friends&#34;.  Unfortunately, a very hot item this Christmas!  Had to pay more than market value for this item but worth the look on her face when she opened it!  Fast, efficient shipping.  Thanks!
B009NQKPUW|5.0|You know how some things look good in a picture and when you get it you are disappointed.<br />This will not disappoint you.
B0086700CM|4.0|It's a great game. The only reason it has four stars is because I have experienced lag, which for a game like this can make it difficult to play. Other then that I had no other issues!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is so ADDICTING!There's no flaws to it.I would definitely get. Its a great game for kids and adults.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I will be honest here.  I liked MiB II, despite the general consensus being that it's terrible.  I mean, I didn't think it was as good, fun or interesting as the first one, but I don't think it's deserving of the hate it keeps getting.<br /><br />That being said, I didn't have much hopes for this movie.  I kept reading about production problems, script rewritings, filming delays and such, and it did look like MiB (the first movie) was going to be the highlight of the series.<br /><br />After watching the movie in theaters, I'm pleased to announce that is not the case.  I'm prepared to call this movie the highlight (although marginally).  Despite all the problems it had, it's just that good.<br /><br />Yes, the film has a couple of problems and noticeable plot holes, and you get to notice that different scenes of the movie were written by different people.  Why 5 stars, then?  Because it's a really, really entertaining film.<br /><br />The special effects are great, there's no doubt about it.  While the side aliens are not as interesting as other ones in the previous films, the main ones are some of the best, both in concept and portrayal.  Main guys Smith and Jones are as good as ever, if not better.  The 60's setting is very well done (as you might know, this movie involves time travel).  One of the film's highlights, of course, is Brolin's portrayal as 69's Agent K.  His job as portraying a younger Tommy Lee Jones is, at minimum, superb.<br /><br />The script is more interesting too, despite suffering from so many writes and rewrites.  The story is quite engaging, and the movie is character-driven, and surprisingly emotional.  A part of the film will most likely leave you in tears, even in your second or third viewing.<br /><br />All in all, the good far surpasses the bad, so this is a film which deserves to be watched several times.<br /><br />As for the Blu Ray, the quality of the film is top notch.  I haven't watched the extras yet, but I might update the review when I do.w when I do.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five<br /> Cant wait for the rest<br /><br />An Excellent Read
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Purchased the book for my wife who has a vision problem to use on her Kindle DX. After she finished the book I read it too. We both like Grisham.
B0052GACNM|5.0|I've followed Tony Bennett for years. Went to most of his concerts when he came to Boston. He's still going strong at his age.  Keep up the good work Tony!

B0084B5TK8|5.0|The true beginning of a wonderful modern near obsession ,these undead will live forever. [and outside of the mutilation and terror everybody is so charmingly polite to each other].
B004EPZ034|5.0|Was very pleased with this movie. I liked how fast it was shipped. Would be happy to buy again from you.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|For those who may have never had seen the Show.  I recommend it as a  GREAT FAMILY TIME SHOW.  You have to love it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a very good book. It explains what a teenager goes through without getting into details that don't matter to the storyline. Charlie is beginning his life as teenager and in high school. He goes through tough times but he deals with them. Even though he had problems, he is just a regular teenager with teen problems. I do wish though that it ended differently. Overall it was a very good book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I've had no issues with this app it works as good here as on my iPhone. I've been using Facebook for a long time and got a Kindle Fire HD for Christmas. The first app I downloaded was Facebook.
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I got this app and I reallllllllyyyy like it! It has tons of great features and it makes your pictures look amazing. My only problem is that I got this app BEFORE the last update and I never had a problem posting pictures to Facebook but now wont let me log in and I cant post to fb.... sadness.
B00A0SJWQU|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie !!! I never really listen to the critics and I am glad I didn't  on this one.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I don't have time to watch the news to get the weather, this is an accurate app with the ability to check multiple locations. A must get for those whose job duties reflect on the weather.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is one of my favotite games on my kindle fire and on my ipods but they need to make the inspected not look so much like Santa Claus.(I don't beloved in santa claus anymore) I'm just saying
B004FP1WX0|4.0|Interesting glimpse at the duplicitous trend in Internet relationships.  The resolution is sad but brings the truth to light and is done kindly. I admire these filmmakers diligence in pursuing the truth and exposing the thought process behind misleading Internet relationships
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Good book. A little scattered. Drawn out  in some parts but<br /> overall I enjoyed  it. Some stories  we're difficult to follow.
B004SBX112|5.0|Is really fun to play. My grand daughter also like to play it. Thanks very much, am playing it all the time now.
B00007BKVC|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all times. Gina Davis and Susan Sarandon are two of my favorite actresses. Thanks
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I really like my new Kindle Fire HD case, I love the color red and it fits so well into all of my other red items. Was so glad I was able to get this product, It keeps my Fire safe and seems to be really well made. Thanks again.
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game its self is fine.  I think playing it on my new Kindle Fire, will take me a little while to get the hang of using the device.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|The production gives the show a feeling of happening live in my livingroom. Quality of video is excellent. I look forward to watching it again.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is pretty awesome I love the jet packs and you don't really have to buy anything with real money this awesome I just love it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was an amazing heartfelt book to read. I felt so many emotions throughout this story.  I read in one day because I couldn't put it down. I had to know what happened next.  It was a beautiful love story in the end and not just between Sky and Holder but the Love and bonds between a \\"mother\\" and her daughter, a brother and his sister, and between two best friends. A must read!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Love this book!!! Couldn't put it down. Made me realize the importance of having other people to rely on in difficult times.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|It has been good to read during the long Christmas break. I have enjoyed the escape. Read to read more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read the whole series kept me glued . First book was a gift second was borrowed. This book was the best price anywhere. I had to have it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|CURSE YOU JOHN GREEN! How dare you pull a Van Houten on me like this! This book changed my life. I will never forget it. I will now desperately search the internet for a sequel, draw Ven Diagrams, and eat eggs for lunch.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is worth every penny, second, and tear. The ending was heartbreaking, but still a good one. If you are debating on buying it, SHUT UP AND READ THE AWESOME BOOK ALREADY!<br /><br />Edit after a second read: OH. MY. GLOB!!!!! There's movie coming out sometime! But this book was still amazing. Every time I read it, I still feel it. This is one of those books where reading it really makes you rethink EVERY. SINGLE. THING. YOU. KNOW. Just shut up and buy the darn book.<br /><br />Edit after a third read: I started this book at 9:00pm, and now it is 12:30pm. I am in tears, because I failed to remember how brutally heart wrenching and beautifully composed this book is.
B009JZVT70|5.0|I was on the edged of my chair every episode I can't wait to see what will happen when season 3 begins
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Okay so everything is working perfectly......However I'm not receiving notifications when I'm not on the Facebook app it self...so I would never know if someone message my unless I go and check it myself
0783240287|5.0|Wonderful show.  All my friends have borrowed it and love it also.  The only problem I have with this DVD (and most others, to be honest) is that the volume of the TV needs to be turned WAY up in order to hear it.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|My older sister got me this book because I was constantly complaining about how all the stories I have read all have happy ending and how I wanted to read just one story without one. This book was more than I could have asked for I read it in a mere day simply because it was so interesting and had such a twist of events. As an 11 year old I can not possibly imagine everything these children went through,overall I can't wait to read the second book!!
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Glad to be able to still get this CD - my original one was stolen! Wish she do a new CD though!
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Can't moviemakers come up with a new trope?  Watching the dastardly doomsday device ticking down to zero is so 1970s.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|I was very anxious to get this CD.  I must admit, I had to listen to it several to let the songs &#34;grow on me&#34;............now I really enjoy it.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|You have many more options for creativity with this game as you make your own mode of transportation for the piggy!<br />My kids say it is awesome &#34;because you can fly around and stuff&#34;. Ha!<br /><br />No complaints yet!
0525423842|5.0|i love all of his books, they are great<br />i would recomend all of his books to any one. fdf
B0091LS07E|5.0|Pure artistry...once again Alicia moves forward to be even better!I absolutely love the opening De Novo Adagio...so simple and pure.  It is the perfect lead-in to Brand New Me but I would have been just as pleased to hear just a little more piano.  I am very pleased with this CD and the new Alicia Keys!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love the app and at times, I spend hours playing game after game with out even realizing it. In addition, my husband always enjoys the app.
B00A1EOBJQ|3.0|Although the music on tv sounds great, the CD music tone is not as good.  Still love the songs though
B009MCRHH6|5.0|A thought provoking game as you build bridges, towers and other structures to move the goo.  Worked perfectly fine on my Samsung Galaxy 3.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|My first full length 3D movie at home. Like a lot of space movies I thought this would be a good test to see how 3D does with dark shots. To my surprise very watchable
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift extra (it was 5 bucks at the time) and wound up giving it to my mom. My fiance and myself (both 24yrs old), two of our friends (25 and 27) and my parents watched this film and enjoyed it. It was funny, and had a great back story to The Lorax, while also giving you more information as to what happens after the book. If you love the Seuss books then I think this film did it justice.
B00005U8EM|5.0|i have to say that i love this movie more then ever...watch the director's commentary version and u will see the movie in a new light...laughing hard throughout the director's stories and talking
B0054JELS4|5.0|I ordered this for my parents for Christmas 2012,<br /><br />  I am very pleased with this purchase. Once their anniversary comes around I am going to purchase the other seasons thorough Amazon as well.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is one of the best books I've read this year, and I have read many.  This is a book about courage and honesty - a love story that makes your heart sing, despite the messiness and brokenness of life.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I downloaded the Free Angry Birds Seasons onto my Kindle Fire to see if I would like the game.  Now I am addicted such that I actually paid for the Angry Birds HD for Kindle.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|A great read. Well researched, with numerous details that your history teacher didn't share with you. If you like history and US politics, this is the book for you.
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I chose Google for my Kindle Fire seearch engine because I prefer it over Bing and Ask.  I've been using Google for years on my laptop and desktop computers.  Don't know what I would do without it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest, and this app makes it easier and even more fun to explore. It's way too easy too waste a lot of time planning recipes, home ideas, or whatever you're into.  Love it!
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I usually enjoy sharing books picked for my wife's book club. But I had to let her handle this one alone.
B002BWP49C|5.0|so glad i was able to pre-order this online so that i wouldnt need to wait in line the first day it was released.  alot of stores sold out in my area so it was nice that i was able to make sure i got it
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this series and so far this was the best! I loved this book and I hope there will be more.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|The movie was funny.  Although it was a lot of foul language and sexual suggestion scenes.  But overall the movie made sense for the type of movie it was
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|The movie followed the book pretty closely which I always like. I'm looking forward to the next one comes out!
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|I always enjoy action movies but without the &#34;corny-ness&#34;. This was a good action movie without the &#34;corny-ness&#34;. It had realism

B009JBZH54|5.0|The film contains a fine cast of talented actors. Christian Bale, of course still makes is a great Batman. Michael Cain is fantastic, as he always is. He gives such a powerful performance, he really ought to be considered for an Oscar nomination. Tom Hardy as Bane is utterly terrifying, at times, and completely ominous. Anne Hathaway as Catwoman/Selina Kyle is a scene stealer. She is completely engrossing. Everyone is so great, the dynamic scenes between the actors are so well done, so well written, and so well directed. The Dark Knight Rises is is emotionally riveting and amazing to view.<br /><br />At a running time of almost 3 hours, the film never becomes dull, which is pretty impressive. The movie's action sequences are spectacularly well created and very intense. The dialogue between the character's are intelligent and highly believable. The movie's soundtrack is terrific and really exemplify's many of the movie's scenes. Extremely well editing and sound use really develop many of the movie's action scenes, so it's not just explosions and visuals like in many other movies. Nolan creates a grand, dirty, engrossing world, and his action sequences just hum.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|Just saw the movie with my wife and she needed to have the soundtrack. I poped it on my Ipod and was surprised how good it was. &#34;Cups&#34; is a great quiet song that is great to listen to in the car.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|The entire cast really delivered. You needed more than just action actors or stunt doubles to play all these parts. The pathos is there but so are the timing and true deep performances. Look, I was missing Ed Norton as much as anyone on that hype train I talked about but I'm so happy to say that Mark Ruffalo won me over. I hope he's locked up for the long haul because we don't need any more changes. Three was the lucky number for movie Banners. Every other actor in Avnegers that we've seen before is BETTER than their previous incarnation (EVERY single one) with the possible exception of RDJ as Stark. He's great but it's hard to top his take on the character from the original Iron Man in an ensemble movie. I also have to fully disclose that I'm insanely attracted to Scarlett Johansson. I thought her Widow character was amazing but I'm definitely judging that through rose colored glasses. The character arcs that run there course during this film will surprise a lot of general audiences expecting nothing more than a Transformers type popcorn scarfdown.

B0084BMUFA|5.0|Such a great book to read around the holidays, it really reminds you of the true meaning of the season!
B005LAII1C|5.0|The only drawback I could possibly see that would cause someone displeasure would be, like a lot of new comedies, this film pushes the envelope in raunchy, vulgar humor. Plus the different amount of drugs used. This movie will receive (most likely), and be very deserving of a R rating. It doesn't rely solely on shock humor though, there is plenty of good old fashioned clean comedy. But if your like me, and that type of subject matter doesn't bother you, then I HIGHLY recommend this film. And if you're a Seth Macfarlane fan, then that's just a perfectly gift wrapped little bonus for you.
B00AFWEPVI|3.0|Decent camera for a buck, your kid will have hours of fun taking pictures with it. Smile your on candid camera!
B007HACDLK|4.0|It was a good book but pretty predictable.  if you've read the previous books in this series, you'll note that the outcome is expected and you can predict what's going to happen from paragraph to paragraph.  Only drawback is the character of Mitch Rapp and how he is portrayed as a constantly impatient, angry person who is so head strong that it seems he always gets his way.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|There may be spoilers.<br />As usual, Tom Cruise is getting picked on by many as not suitable for this role. And as usual, he's perfect. OK, so he's not 6' 5&#34; or whatever as portrayed in the novels from which the story is extracted. Still, author Lee Child is said to be fine with the casting.<br /><br />Reacher (Cruise) is a highly decorated former soldier whose last job was a military detective. After his discharge Reacher disappears, for whatever reason. The film opens with an effective sequence of a sniper setting up in a high rise parking garage across from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium. He manages to pick off 5 individuals seemingly at random, but also leaves enough clues that the police headed by detective Emerson (David Oyelowo) quickly arrest a suspect (Joseph Sikora).<br /><br />Barr (Sikora) is severely beaten during a jail transfer. When first captured he asked his attorney (Rosamund Pike) to &#34;get Jack Reacher.&#34; As it turns out Reacher finds Helen (Pike), her father (Richard Jenkins) who is also the DA and Emerson. Director and screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie manages to lead the audience along with Reacher sifting through the clues with more attention than the police. McQuarrie even tosses in a couple Hitchcock-like &#34;McGuffins&#34; to complicate matters.<br /><br />Clearly something is amiss and the film shifts gears into a corruption fed financial ploy. As the bad guys target Reacher, he goes into combat mode. He's highly skilled. As the primo gangster, Werner Herzog proves he's as effective in front of the camera as behind it. His Teutonic, one-eyed, fingerless take of a prison survivor is memorable. We do get the usual amount of gun play but it is mostly concentrated in scenes involving Reacher and an aging, newly acquired friend (Robert Duvall) attempting to rescue a kidnapped Helen.<br /><br />The film may not be perfect as a couple of the scenes just seemed to be pasted in at the last minute to clarify something that happened earlier. But there are other surprises that keep things interesting and helps make this action/thriller a cut above the norm.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />(BLU RAY UPDATE) August 20, 2016<br />With a new “Jack Reacher” film due in a month or two, I thought it might be fun to go back and watch the original which came out around Christmas, 2012.  I hadn’t seen it since, but I liked it then and even more now on Blu ray.  As usual a second viewing provides an opportunity to pick up on little tidbits missed the first time around.<br /><br />Director and writer Christopher McQuarrie draws the audience in from the very beginning when we see a lone gunman known as Charlie (Jai Courtney) set up a scoped-out rifle in a parking garage across the river from the Pittsburgh Pirates stadium.  A walking path between the stadium and river is flush with pedestrians and joggers.  Charlie scans the people left and right and we get to see them, all unexpecting innocents, young and old, male and female.  He then begins to pick them off one by one.<br /><br />A suspect, Barr (Joseph Sikora) is captured quickly thanks to a fingerprint left on a quarter fed to a parking meter where his vehicle was parked.  Barr, a former Army sniper doesn’t confess and asks that Jack Reacher be found to help him.  His attorney, Helen (Rosamund Pike) and her father, the D. A. (Richard Jenkins) are surprised that Reacher shows up unexpectedly.  Reacher is recruited to help Helen and he begins to look into the case.  His former military job was a detective and he worked to convict Barr of killing civilians in Iraq.<br /><br />What makes this movie well above average is that Reacher, well played by Tom Cruise, brings to light small clues that begin to add up.  The audience tends to go along with him, not necessarily looking ahead or being left behind.  We’re kind of feel like a partner and discover the revelations as he does.  Reacher is a mysterious individual both before and after the case is solved.  I look forward to the new movie.<br /><br />This 2013 Blu ray package includes a DVD and a digital download.

B007885IJU|1.0|The album is great!  It arrived in a timely manner in a well packed box.  The problem is, the record is warped.  Not a little warped... a lot warped.  It still plays, but it made me look like an idiot when it was opened as a christmas present.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Not only can I not use the Facebook app to access Facebook, I can't even log in using the browser. It keeps asking for my email address even though I typed it in. WTF. Please fix.
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|The music is awesome, but it is just a little odd that there are a couple of missing KEY songs from the movie/story on the soundtrack, but are in the movie. I knew that before purchasing, but went ahead anyway because the price is right. Hoping that now that the movie is released, one can buy the two missing songs individually. I gave it four stars because I was aware of the missing songs prior to purchase and the rest of the music is great.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I thought this was a lovely book. It really seemed to apply to the life of a teenager. I have recently gone through a couple things Charlie did. I loved the style it was written in. The letters were an easy way to follow the story. I would definitely recommend it to others

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best Sci-Fi I have read this year, and perhaps in the last ten. The pace is perfect, I was caught up in the character and his struggles and didn't put it down.<br /><br />This concept has been done before, and I was worried that the book would be a dull rehash. However I think the author has done a fantastic job with the characters, the situations, and the science. The book feels like it was well researched, but I didn't fact check it and it could be that the author is simply gifted with the ability to make it seem to be fact based. Regardless, the story sucked me in and that's what really matters.<br /><br />Some have been critical of the occasional profanity but I thought it added realism and I am pretty sure that most folks in similar situations would have been less polite. I will avoid spoilers, but the main character comes across as remarkable and in his situation very charitable.

B000FVE3A2|4.0|The Invicta Grand Diver model 3044 is quite large and has considerable heft, but despite this it fits well on the wrist. The bracelet's links are solid stainless steel and comes with a diver's style clasp. Sizing the bracelet is quite easy if you have the proper tools and the bracelet comes generously sized to accommodate a wide variety of wrist sizes, something I wish more watch manufacturers would do. It's a very good looking dive-style watch and it's rated at 300 metres of water resistance.  The Rolex-inspired dial is basic, yet attractive and the lume on the markers and hands is decent. The watch's case and bracelet are likely made in China, but the automatic movement on this particular model is a Seiko NH35A which can be hacked, unlike the previous Miyota movement used before on this watch series and so far it's kept excellent time. The overall fit and finish of the watch is quite good considering the cost and it looks and feels like a much more expensive watch. My only real criticism about the watch is with the Omega-style timing bezel. It's not bad by any means, and it works as it should, but it's not as easy to turn as a coin-edge. Invicta has a mind-boggling amount of variations of their watch models, so I don't know if they have a Grand Diver with a coin-edge bezel or not, but I'm very satisfied with the watch...
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great rental for a girls night or young kids. My sisters and me had fun watching this show, and rooting for the girls. The men in our household would have rather watched basketball on Christmas. It's a fun, lighthearted glee like movie!

B0076DELIG|5.0|Unable to put this book down. Great reading. Best of the series so far. I would recommend this exceptional book
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I have been listening constantly since i got it.  Loved the stage version, love the film.  MY ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT... I want a full two disc soundtrack to relive every precious moment.  While it is not the stage or concert production that fans are so accustomed to, it is the raw ,powerful emotion of the moment that grabs and pulls you in.  I personally will never be able to listen to EMPTY CHAIRS AT EMPTY TABLES in the same way again.  Eddie REMAYNE (forgive my spelling if incorrect), gave the most precious, tender rendition of this song that I have ever heard and I am a MICHAEL BALL devotee.  I think they said that the version they used was his 21st take. There are some truly amazing performances like HUGH'S SOLILOQUY AND THE EPILOGUE that melt my heart. And I cannot forget I DREAMED A DREAM delivered with such truth and vulnerability.  Sadly A LITTLE FALL OF RAIN didn't make the highlights and it is one of my favorite LES MISERABLES moments.  SO IM REALLY HOPING FOR MORE !!!!!  PLEASE!!!!
B006O6F932|4.0|For any child with a collection of Monster High dolls, this is a great add on. It has a lot offer for hours of pretend play. We haven't seen the webisodes or DVD, but my kids knew exactly what each area is used for. The whole school is very detailed with lots of fun things to talk about or play with.<br /><br />Assembly was fairly easy. For the most part, instructions were clear and things snapped into place. The stairway to the second floor easily comes loose, but if we're careful, we don't knock it down. We were a bit confused about how to secure the two walls together using this little hook, but once we figured it out the first time, it was easy to do again. Some parts, like the spider webs, can go multiple places on the school. Stickers were simple to put in place and there were lots of extras to decorate as you wish. The whole thing folds up neatly for when it's not in use. There are a lot of small parts though - food, locks for the lockers, casketball and such. I'd suggest keeping a Ziploc or plastic bin to put those and the tables, desks and chairs in so they don't get lost when the school is closed up and stored.<br /><br />I'd say this is the best Monster High accessory we have. I'm sure it would be a hit with any Monster High fan.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|A friend recommended this to me, as I am an animal lover AND a Richard Gere fan. (I though I had seen all of his movies but this one passed me up.) Beautiful sad movie that is based on the true Japanese story. Get the hanky out. You will enjoy it but you will cry.
B009MO5G90|2.0|totally rushed into production.... love the series, but major letdown for the franchise... imo  Action scenes... fairly good, but the story is the total shortcoming of this movie, what in the world were they trying to do in the beginning, with the story.... aweful!!!

0307595862|4.0|As a rule, I usually steer clear of series type novels, especially those that follow a particular `detective'.  I don't know why I've done this, or when this rule was set but I just know that for as long as I've been reading, which has been all of my life, I have actively avoided their existence.  My friends would all delve into five, six, twenty novels following the adventures of some washed up cop on the tail of twisted serial killers and I found the idea almost beneath me, like detective novels were the `television movie' of the lit world.  I don't plan of backing up this ridiculous assertion or even begin to try and reason my way out of it.  It is what it is and I was clearly in the wrong.  You see, a few years ago the world was introduced Stieg Larson, the author of the `Girl with the Dragon Tattoo' series.  The world went crazy over the books and the movies and I was sucked into the fervor and wound up reading the first in the series (the other two are sitting on my desk waiting to be absorbed).  I was spellbound.  Was it perfect?  No.  Was it profound or even tonally original?  No.  What it was was darn good writing and exceptionally exciting storytelling that kept me not only glued to every page but begging for more.<br /><br />That is when I was turned on to Jo Nesbo.  Quite a few book critics were siting he was the next Stieg Larson, the man to carry to torch now that Stieg was out of the picture (R.I.P.).  This was around the time that `The Snowman' was getting its stateside release.  I was under the impression that Nesbo was new to the game, since his exposure was so sudden and new, but I know now that the `Harry Hole' series isn't so new.  Still, `The Snowman' was my first experience with the detective.<br /><br />It won't be my last.<br /><br />I don't want to expose too much about this story because the beauty of a mystery of this sort is the complete and total unraveling of the plot.  If you know anything but the mere basics then the story could lose a lot of the impact.  So for that I'll say the minimal.<br /><br />The basic premise follows Harry Hole, famed detective who is hot off the capture of a serial killer in Australia (seriously, I have some catching up to do), as he tries to track down a killer of women.  Yes, the book opens with a disappearance of a married mother and follows that up with another.  And then a body (or part of one), and yes, there are snowmen present.  Apparently, this madman likes to taunt his victims with a snowman in their yard the night before he strikes.  Trying to flesh out the answers is harder than Hole anticipates, and the twists and turns that come up until the novel's conclusion are plenty.<br /><br />First off, the books greatest aspect is the writing.  Nesbo weaves such a masterful web that we are sucked in from the very beginning.  Very little about his writing style and story development suffers.  Instead, Nesbo is able to flesh out whole characters, even supporting ones, so that even those of us who haven't read previous novels can feel as though we aren't missing much at all.  `The Snowman' is entirely engaging and rewarding.<br /><br />But, the book, while satisfying as a whole, is not without detractors.<br /><br />My biggest quibble has to do with the development of one particular character, Katrine Bratt.  I found that her character just didn't develop the way she should have.  In fact, she felt like two separate characters, and when we are thrown a particular twist (I'll just throw the phrase `pig mask' out there and let you figure it out when you get there) I felt like her character as a whole just fell to pieces, especially when they try and pick the pieces up and put her back together (respectably at that, which doesn't work).  My other criticism has to do with the final `snowman' sequence (and by `snowman' I mean a literal snowman).  It just felt like Nesbo was going overboard.  Having your serial killer called the snowman and make snowmen before he strikes is a bit odd to begin with, but it is forgivable until the finale.  It is just too over the top for me and brought down the book's credibility.<br /><br />Still, I tore through this book in one day and don't regret a second of time I spent reading it (flu season is the worst, so it's nice to have something engrossing to read while you're stuck in bed).s a bit odd to begin with, but it is forgivable until the finale.  It is just too over the top for me and brought down the book's credibility.<br /><br />Still, I tore through this book in one day and don't regret a second of time I spent reading it (flu season is the worst, so it's nice to have something engrossing to read while you're stuck in bed).

B007VUCAVO|5.0|THIS APP is a MUST HAVE. You have a battery in that device you're using there, and you need to know it's state to avoid being caught off guard and losing data, and so on. This app does it better than any other I've seen. Most folks probably do not need everything this thing can do, but it's all there for those who do! The alarm features THAT YOU SPECIFY are the best feature of all. Kindle Fire HD does not have a battery charge indicator like the original Kindle Fire, so unless you have an app like this which will actually &quot;tell you&quot; your battery is charged, you have to go to system control to check... over and over and over again. GET THIS APP IF YOU WANT CONTROL AND PIECE OF MIND.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This headset is great, I have used it without restraint for 3 years with 30-50 hours of gaming per week. The only problem is a low hiss, but the only time you can hear it is when the game volume is all the way turned down. A flaw is the chat cable does eventually break no matter how well you treat it. The one that comes with the original headset lasts for about a year then he replacements usually last about 3 months.. Back to the headset; the sound quality is terrific surround sound is still top notch from when i first got them, and the headset is extremely comfortable.

I was present on a hill on Mutters Ridge that Michael Herr and Sean Flynn (the son of Errol Flynn and Lillie Damita) had gotten off of a resupply chopper on  not long before dark in August of 1968... It was to be the evening before I experienced being under fire up close and personal as well as my first time directing close air support and medevacs by helicopter.... There is a description of the interaction between my battalion commander and the two journalist that I had seen and more I heard while on the perimeter not far from where they had decided to sleep... When I read Herr's account of the conversation and his description of the situation, I knew damned well that he had given an honest account of it so that validated the entire book for me.. He also co-wrote the screen play for \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" and contributed to the narration for \\"Apocalypse Now\\"....
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the most insightful and awakening novels I've ever read.  Chbosky created a well thought-out read by addressing Charlie's letters to \\"dear friend\\", and somehow tied everything together at the end to make the reader feel special in a unique way. But at the same time he delivered an important message, about life and how crucial it is to actually \\"participate\\" in it.

B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean is the songwriter of 2012 (maybe the decade, but we'll have to see on that one). His bite-size tales of disaffected lovers, druggies, and the wealthy reflect the bleakness of the current state of affairs in the world, in particular the US, this year. The music that surrounds his darkly humorous lyrics is tuned into the sounds of now: bits of R&B, jazz, hip-hop, dance music and indie rock grace the eclectic sound-pallatte of this record making it feel like flipping the channels on a TV (or just surfing Spotify or YouTube). Highlights include \\"Thinking Bout You,\\" \\"Sweet Life,\\" \\"Super Rich Kids,\\" \\"Pyramids,\\" \\"Lost,\\" and \\"Bad Religion\\" but the whole album has infinite replay value. Album of the year hands down!<br />Wishing Frank luck at the Grammys in '13 :)

B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is fun and a great use of time. It works perfectly on my kindle fire and it would be fun for all ages. Some of the games are pretty challenging but some are easy. I played this for over an hour strait! I love these games and I am so glad I got this! You should get it to'
B004GYY714|5.0|I had to increase the buffering time a little to get it to work without stopping.  I just increased it in steps until it worked reliably.  I think it took two steps, to 20 seconds instead of 10.  No problems after that.<br /><br />It makes my Samsung Galaxy Pad 2 7.0 into a kind of super radio.  I can pick up local stations that are not easy to get in my area, and then there's stations all over the world in addition to podcasts.  All of it is searchable and categorized, so you can search for public radio talk news stations, or comedy, etc.<br /><br />The free version works well, but I'm thinking of buying the paid version for a few extra features, and to support the development of the app, since I like using it.
B0086700CM|4.0|This app is fun to play and tests your reaction skills. It is great for almost all ages. However, sometimes it annoyingly misreads my turn swipe for a jump, sending me very annoyed off the cliff at 500m when i am attempting to get to 3,000m. But most of the time this is a great and addicting game. Because it is free i would download it to all devices that can support it.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|As someone who loves historical fiction, movies, and television, this series has been just what I have been missing. I love how the series covers large amounts of time, skipping weeks and months ahead after each episode. The drama is subtle and believable, allowing me to analyze characters much like I do real people. I didn't love season two as much as season one because the war theme was quite depressing. Also, I have come to the conclusion that the main story line is somewhat copied from Gone With the Wind which is a little disappointing. Overall, this is a great show and I wish there were more series like it.
B005HSL626|5.0|Because of this app i often feel like a ninja. There are fun blades and backgrounds to unlock in challenging ways. This is game that will test your reflexes and may sometimes frustrate you. If you can't handle that, then this isn't the app for you. I would recommend this to most ages.
B000SZK41M|5.0|How Many Stars would I give Die Hard?  How many you got?  Watching John McClane destroy Nakitomi is a Christmas tradition 'round these parts.
B007RTAR64|5.0|Katniss everdeen isn't a barby's girl but it's a very beautiful idea.<br />Good quality and some details.Very good! yes yes
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is maddening! Those little pgs laugh at me all the time..........silly pigs!!<br />Kids and adults will en joy this game. My problem is I don't really know how to play and<br />all the little tricks to do to beat the game, but I 'm learning. Lots of fun!
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|this was an interesting read and good for men too. could have been a little shorter though but i enjoyed it and kept my interest throughout the book.
B00723NWJE|4.0|Nora Jones is a true Artist and this CD just proves that once again. I'm a big fan of hers and I think that this disc is very well done.
B0001GL3K4|5.0|my daughter loves this movie and has been wanting to own it for quite some time.  i had trouble finding it anywhere.  she is very happy and it is a cute movie but a little r rated at times.
B0091REZMW|4.0|It is okay. Fun to play, but too many things that require the in game currency you have to pay for.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I played this on my Kindle Fire HD, no trouble downloading or playing. I liked the storyline &amp; the graphics are what you'd expect from this dev. The only complaint I have is that it ends too soon. I'd definitely recommend this game.
0312360266|5.0|Great book love the set and want them to make more. got here fast and look good for how cheep i got it for.
B004QX07G4|3.0|This is a good book for a day you may need cheering up. It's also a quick read. Can be a bit random but in a funny way.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|It was downloaded on Kindle Fire - I don't use Kindle Fire so I haven't read the book because I only like to read BOOKS not something written on a computer screen.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I really believe Dr. Alexander had a near death experience of the divine and I appreciate his sharing his experience with the world..  I think he proved his point in a little too much detail that his brain was really dead at the time.  However, I know plenty of intellectuals who refuse to believe that miracles do happen and need tremendous scientific backup for everything.  The way he responded to this experience turned me off.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Since they changed our privacy settings I don't use it anymore - it is on the Kindle Fire which I also won't use as I don't like computers or any type of electronic gadget.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I'm really enjoying watching their relationship evolve. I look forward to reading the last book and hopefully reading they live happily ever after
0307200477|5.0|Beautiful Book.  My son loved this book as a baby, I was pleae to find this edition.  I know my grandaughter will like it.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Riveting story, patiently waiting for book two in the series, if I wait too long I may have to read it again.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|Have not had the chance to use this yet so I will get back with you.  Just got my kindle for x-mas so it will take me some time.
B0017XD3OY|5.0|This movie was a good movie to watch, and the packaging of the movie was in good standards. I would purchase from buyer again.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|To be free this is a very fun game. It makes you use your thinking abilities to finish the levels.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is a nail-biting follow up to the first book and delivers on surprises! Can't wait to read the third.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Was so good different from what I expected and so much better keeper my attention and couldn't stop reading till I finished it
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|It's in the same awesome vein as the other Resident Evil movies. Milla Jovovich is as hot and kick ass as always. Hopefully there will be another couple of movies in the franchise.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I prefer MP3s to CDs. Less bulk, more enjoyment. Avatar is one of my favorite movies, and I enjoy the soundtrack on my walks. Thanks for the convenience.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|Funniest movie I've seen in years. It may even be funnier than Super Troopers. I think it's dumb to have a predetermined number of words for this review to be valid.
0783233477|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Some people may have a difficult time relating to this movie, but for me, it's in the realm of the everyday world. There just needs to be a little more spiritual connection to that real world.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|My friend introduced me to Alt-J not too long ago, and I was immediately hooked. This CD is great, and there is not a single song on it that I don't like.
B002ZG999U|5.0|Arrived in the condition I had hoped for. Lots of action. Excellent storyline. Personally, I think it's better than the sequel.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Easy read. I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I hear it's just as good.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|I prefer MP3s to CDs. Less bulk, more enjoyment. Some of the songs from this album brings back good memories. Thanks for the convenience.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is great it is easy to use and very reliable. I would recommend it for anyone that likes to see the weather and wants the weather to be right for a change.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is the second time I've read this book and it is still just as amazing! Buy Buy Buy Buy!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game!  I thought I had a gift for spatial relationships, but this &quot;kiddie&quot; game is plenty challenging.  A good way to sharpen your mind while enjoying some downtime.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|This was too &#34;bookish.&#34;  It seemed very contrived.  I came away from it wondering why he didn't do a better job of connecting witih the reader.  Possibly too intelligent.
B008L1DNGI|3.0|Haven't played the game yet, but noticed that it can't be moved to the SD card. Why not? It's not like it's a necessary app.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I went to see both &#34;The Fighter&#34; and &#34;Warrior&#34;  at the Movie Theaters and I was surprised that Warrior did not receive the appreciation it deserves. It is an Awesome movie with the Drama, Story line, and Action.  This movie is totally worth it!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun, Fun, Fun Lots of different screens and levels to play.  Great entertainment especially, since you get all of this for free.
B009JBZH54|5.0|The series is one of the Best Series to ever be put together on Blu Ray...A lot better than the older series.
B00992CF6W|4.0|My daughter likes this version but prefers the complete version you get on the computer.  But she still gets to build on her kindle so she's happy.  This game will be great for traveling since it takes up so much time.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This might be my personal favorite show of all time. I still watch episodes frequently. I even fall asleep to episodes because I've seem them all and I know what is going to happen. It won awards that it deserved. It completed 7 season and probably could have used more. It comes in a nice box, with a script of the pilot episode. I've read part of it. If you don't have this already, buy it.
B008QOFOQW|5.0|I got my girls (6 and 8 years old) these for Xmas this year - Couldn't have made a better choice. This is the only toy ever that have kept them busy for more than 30 minutes. I want some of my own now :D Fun thing for Dads and daughters for sure.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This episode is awesome n sad at the same time cause so many  of there people die. .love it. . .
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Had a great plot, sexy male lead and an awesome twist. Would definitely recommend.<br />The only thing I wish we're different is the characters being a little older, but it's still great.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Well I love to read dairy of a wimpy kid. I loved it. It was funny how Greg thought he was running away from the police. Lol they got snowed in. He gets worried about what Santa is giving him. He hates how far is Christmas and thanksgiving
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This a good game because it feels really realistic and gives you lots of options to expand on. I think that this game  is fun, addicting, and well made. All of the necessary things for an exceptional game.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Pretty good. Trumps the film. It's a quick and easy read. Lots of intensity and grit. A nice beginning to the series.
1451695195|5.0|This is one of the best books written about NDE's and I have been involved in this subject and others for a very long time.  I believe everyone should read this and it would totally eliminate fear of the death of the body, and convince others that our soul essence continues, It would definitely help others that are experiencing grief from the loss of a loved one.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Fun but with challenging levels. luckily I got this on a day it was free. I love this app. Even if it wasn't free I probably still would of  got it. This one is on my favorites list. If I had to rate this on a scale of one to ten I would say 9 and a half. This is worthy of the cost. There are 4 different scenes . I can't stop playing this . I blame this app for my battery dying all the time.
6305428042|5.0|Great family movie.  Great acting, fun to watch.  We never tire watching this year after year.  Highly recommend this movie.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Love this app because it is addictive. I have seen the recent movie and then saw this on my kindle. I at least had to try it out.....then POW ice age exploded and I just kept on playing. I do not like the challenges it makes u do. They take forever. However I love u can create your villages name. My villages name is Firefox.<br />Love this in a lot  of different was. Also I wish they would fix the glitches and they amount of time it takes for u to start playing. A very good game though.
1579128955|5.0|This is a very cool book with a lot of great information shared in a really easy format for understanding. It was a gift and the recipient loved it.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Wasn't fantastic. That's all I have to say about it and I think it's stupid that you require so many words for a review. The first amount of words I choose to  write should be up to me
B0031RAOVY|5.0|BECAUSE OF CERTAIN COMMENTS I READ CONCERNING WHY DIDN'T SOMEONE TAKE HIM HOME WHEN HIS OWNER DIED, PLEASE READ THIS REAL STORY OF THIS FAMOUS DOG AND PUT TO REST ANY QUESTIONS OR DOUBTS ON WHY THIS DEVOTED LOVING DOG COULD NOT BE ADOPTED.  I DID RESEARCH ON THIS TRUE STORY AND FOUND THIS ARTICLE WRITTEN ABOUT HACHIKO.<br /><br />Hachiko, Japanfs most famous dog<br />Instead of listening to the daily news about how much money stole this or that CEO, how many people were killed in last nightfs bomb blast in West Bank, how much the taxes will go up, why donft we take a breath and talk about something thatfs not all that interesting for the media!<br /><br />In Tokyofs Shibuya ward (gBitter Valleyh in English), specifically in the area called Dogenzaka, right by the busiest intersection on the planet where every 3 minutes hundreds of people cross the street, stands a statue of the most famous dog in Japan, but virtually unknown in other parts of the world. The always busy area around this statue today serves as a meeting point that basically every Tokyoite knows about. Itfs well known that the Japanese love their pets, but what did this dog named Hachiko do to get his own statue right here?<br /><br />The true story of Hachiko<br /><br />Letfs roll back 86 years. Hachiko ((n`ö), white male dog of Akita breed, was born in 1923 on a farm near the city of Odate in Akita prefecture on the north of Honshu. Nearly a year later he was brought to Tokyo by his owner, Hidesaburo Ueno, a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo<br /><br />Every morning when Ueno went to work, Hachiko (also called Hachi) saw him off at the front door and waited for him in late afternoon on the same spot at the nearby Shibuya Station. This has become their daily routine. The tragedy occured in May of 1925 when Hachiko was eighteen months old. That day the professor didnft arrive by train as usual. At the university he suffered a stroke. He died and never came back to the station where his friend was waiting for him.<br /><br />After Uenofs death, Hachiko was given away to new owners but he escaped every time, returning to his old home where he used to live with his master. When Hachiko eventually realized that the professor didnft live there anymore, he went back to the station. After that day, every time exactly at 4 ofclock when the train arrived, Hachiko came to wait in hopes of seeing his master.<br /><br />This continued day after day, month after month, for the next 10 years. Many people who passed through the station every day, even brought food for Hachiko as he waited. He drew attention of one of former Uenofs students who followed the dog home and learned about his story from the new owners. The student was fascinated with the story and afterwards visited Hachiko many times as he began to write articles about him and the Akita breed.<br /><br />In 1933, after one of his articles was published in Asahi Shinbun, Japanfs biggest newspaper, the dog became a national sensation. Teachers and parents around the country used Hachikofs loyalty as an example for children to follow. Eventually, Hachiko became national symbol of loyalty. His bronze statue was erected in front of the station and Hachiko himself was present at the opening ceremony. Unfortunately, during World War II the statue was melted down for war efforts. In 1948, Takeshi Ando, son of the original artist, was commissioned to create the second statue.<br /><br />Hachiko was found dead on March 8, 1935 on a street in Shibuya. He died because of heart infection, and 3 or 4 yakitori sticks were found in his stomach (yakitori is fried chicken meat on a stick). Hachikofs stuffed and mounted remains can be seen in the National Science Museum in Ueno Park in Tokyo. Today, the dogfs statue still stands in front of the Shibuya Station, waiting and hoping that his master will come home.<br /><br />This morning I went down to Shibuya to take some photos of the statue and the surroundings:
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Good time killer. The allies need nerfed when playing as the zombies. All the skills are quite useful. Arrows are definitely the way to go.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I've never seen the beginning and this was on sale for $19.99 so I snatched it up because of the price.  I love this movie!  I will definitely watch it over and over again!
B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This game is really cool. It is definitely one of my favorite retro games. It has lots of power ups. worth every penny.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This came faster than expected and was in incredible condition.  This was purchased as a preorder and we received a great deal on it.  LOVED THE GIFT!
B003EYVXUU|5.0|The other version of the movie was explicit in other words  it got away with details that should have not existed.  I see why they decided to make another version in English but I'm happy we got an American version so I can enjoy the great quality and the great movie even though I'm almost tired of vampire movies .
B0026NBZDU|4.0|The prose was very interesting to read. It puts you in the place and time of the book. It's a great read I would have never guessed the plots. I will definitely read more of her books now
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Protects my new Kindle.  THe color is perfect for me.  I even bought a purple stylus. Very happy with my purchase.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Great singer, like almost all the songs. Excited to hear the Cure cover. If you like Adele's singles I'd recommend it
B0092QITO2|3.0|The movie was OK and quite entertaining, however, I experienced frequent audio drop-outs on the bitstream Dolby TrueHD when playing back on my Oppo Bluray player. Switching to LPCM did avoid the issue, but that's a pain to have to do whenever you want to watch this title. I am therefore returning the disc.<br />UPDATE: Replacement Bluray has the same issue
B004LWZW4M|5.0|I've known a lot of people who think it may be boring, but I personally loved this movie. Its a very disturbing look at humanity, and makes you wonder why people are so deadset against evolution. Because the animal in this movie wasnt really the apes. Technically they are animals, but humans lack of compassion is where the real uncivility is. made me tear up. everyone should give it a chance
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play. Seems fair with the dealing. I win a decent proportion of the time. Ads are so far easy to close.
B008NW67E0|4.0|A great second cd. Not as impressed as I was with their first but they still have the sound that makes them them. If you like the first cd you should get the second one
B0094KF4WG|4.0|Direct aproach with good descriptions of the missions and an overview of what is like to be a Navy Seal.
B000002KGT|5.0|I'm only 26 so i didnt grow up listening to this. I love this cd. I've listened to some of their other albums but this is the best one. Almost every song is awesome, and I definitely recommend for anyone to get it. Some of the songs on there I didnt even know they sang until i purchased it. I think the same would be true for others who've never listened to them, and think most people would like at least one song
1558908846|5.0|Man, who doesn't love Stalone in his element?  He is great in this movie, but there are also some great comedy lines in it.  I like this version much better than the newer one.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I have a 10 month old daughter and i had to get her this, She cant understand it now but i wanted her to have it because they dont make cartoons like they used to. I actually intend to get all the old disney movies. I'd recommend everyone to show your children this movie
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|Best movie i have seen in a while. both stars proved their  worth. even had a few chuckles remieds me of my marriage after 52 years. my wife could have played this part.
B000SGRONM|2.0|This book had a great start and just like the holidays it all went downhill from there.  Better books by Sedaris abound.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|The storyline is basically the same as original Snow White fairy tale, but with a twist. The acting was well done, especially the Queen.  A good movie.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|these work great i sell them in my store i have not had one bad complaint or return they are good
B007SGM084|3.0|Fifty Shades, the hottest thing in books since the Hunger Games and Twilight. I bought the bundle not quite realizing that it is the same as buying a book in the store that has three stories in it.  In theory it's great, but in practice, not so much.  I find it very hard to navigate between books and if you owe your place as I did a couple times it was nearly impossible to get back to. I'm not even sure how I lost my place on a Kindle, but I managed to do so in this bundle more than once.  Needless to say I probably won't be purchasing in 'bundle' format again.  The story is what one would expect, not wonderfully written but I don't get books to critique writing prowess, I buy them to entertain.  The books were saucy, funny and entertaining, but hardy enlightening.  If you want to escape with a decent book, these will do the trick!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|worked but then my camera broke. so now i have a card that sits in a drawer cause everying adopted the sd card besides these guys.
0316212377|5.0|No spoiler alert here.  A full throttle Culture book, Banks again explores his post scarcity universe first conceived long ago in Consider Phlebas. In this, the mongrel human machine hybrid Culture supports the transcendence of a kindred species into the sublime higher dimensions.  Banks surely joins Asimov in creative capabilities and thought-provoking concepts.  This book features the rich, complex, occasionally generated language that makes all his works so challenging and intriguing.  The Hydrogen Sonata lacks the incredible complex and intricate plotting of other Banks novels, (i.e. Use of Weapons), and so is a fine entry point to Culture novels, if you must.  However, Banks is good enough to demand chronological reading.  Great fun!
B00AA7O6QC|2.0|I like Statham. And I think it's an interesting idea of Stalone's to get all of the action stars of the last 20 years into one film. It was great to see those guys again. And Statham is always good in everything he does. Since he is playing opposite Stalone, he, Statham, lends credence to what otherwise would have looked totally tawdry. Aside from the inability of Stalone to actually kiss a girl (seen also in the original Expendables), the action is well-done. It's just that the story is barely believable.<br /><br />I know.....who cares? It's all about shooting hundreds of guys, blowing their head off and somehow escaping any kind of wound whatsover. It's ridiculous. But after all....it's just an &#34;entertainment.&#34;
B0090P98Z4|5.0|good game easy to learn and lots of hrs of fun.  I recommend this game for anyone who is looking for a fun way to pass the time.
B0027BVMSY|2.0|Wanted to like it. Like Daniel Craig. It became boring and it never got better. I'm looking forward to the next one. I hear it is the best. This one? Not so much.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Ugh!  Too verbose and dry.  Too many details that are not interesting.  I will read the Wikepedia version before I see the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent read.  I could not stop once I started from page one until 374 .  I look forward to the next book.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I like to be able to access twitter now on my kindle, it makes it easier then logging in on the computer all of the time.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Should come in other colors or markings to help distinguish itself from the other cables users may have for other devices
B0094BB4TW|4.0|not sure yet how I completely feel about this yet on the kindle, it only shows a few postings at a time.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This video is so inspiring, especially for anyone who feels like they have some &#34;disadvantage.&#34; Especially parents of autistic children would be encouraged by it.
B007SWZVBQ|4.0|Love GLEE<br />Love the music<br />Love the song selections.<br />Only wish there were more songs to listen too......this is a must have
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable works well, and seems to charge my Kindle faster than the one that came with the Kindle.  That may be because the one that came with the Kindle was cheaply made and didn't work very long.  This one is definitely better.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|Love GLEE<br />Love the music<br />Love the song selections.<br />Only wish there were more songs to listen too......this is a must have
B0011HOEYY|3.0|The movie Came earlier than what I expected so I was pleased. How ever one corners of the box was ripped n the box was unable to close at all it looked really bad so I had to tape it up and this isn't the 1st time I get a damaged item
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this is the best app I ever got because it looks and feels like u r actuly writing small stories, or whatever and I defidently regimens this for people of all ages to write and express their own personal feelings. P.S. this app will keep ur notes safe and will not display them to the public. See Ya!
B000VDDDVO|5.0|Great shape. This product was exactly like the description and came right away. The package was still in original plastic and worked wonderfully.
B008XCPO2Q|2.0|Really lacked plot. Did not keep my interest for 2 hours...even though I love Channing Tatum and Matthew McConnaghey. Music wasn't that great either.
B0063M22QO|4.0|The mahjong game is fun to play - my Grandson and I enjoy it.  He is 5 years old and it is helping with with shapes and numbers and matching.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|Romatic and heartfelt, a great modern movie. Anne Hathaway and Jake Gyllenhal are fantastic together. I could watch this over and over .
B0058VW36U|5.0|I taught my mom how to play it. I don't think I will get my kindle back. This game is very addicting. I would recommend getting this game. I was sad at first because it costed money, but it's worth it. Get the game. It is SO much fun. The only problem is when you it kinda makes you feel guilty about losing because Om Nom gives you the puppy dog face and I feel so bad for him.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|Came as expected and on time for Christmas.<br /><br />Gave this to my sister as a gift, she loved it. I would recommend this.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Enjoyed the characters. I wish the CG artists would pay closer attention to physics. Plot made up for CG failures. Not bad overall &  I  would reccomend this to any Fan.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|great book that provides lots of insight to relationships and helped my hubby and I with ours - also helps to provide insights to your relationships with your children!  Highly recommend it!
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|This version has too much CG with little to no plot. Actors are hard to crittic as there is any plot/story to convey. The first with Arnie is accademy award material in comparison.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I bought this game on Christmas day, when it was the free app of the day. I bought it having low expectations, as it was free, but wow! This game is lots and lots of fun, easily worth the price!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Awesome game!!! No lag whatsoever! I played this game for hours now and it's still fun! I would of paid  ten dollars for it.
030758836X|2.0|1/4 and 3/4 into the book was good enough to not want to put down and those spots only lasted for about 3-4 chapters.  The beginning, the middle and the end............well I kept thinking and asking myself why did I waste ten bucks??? There are many, many other books I would have rather bought.  Very disappointed and certainly wished I could get a refund, but I know that's not ever going to happen.  Just have to learn my lesson on this one.  And to the author, you should have named it Messed Up Girl, or Effed Up Girl, or even Gullible Guy, that would have worked.
068484267X|5.0|There's no food to eat, and dad drinks, babies die left and right -- but worst of all is of course the rain!<br /><br />I'm pretty sure this story was exaggerated, it can't have been quite that bad. And I've heard Irish people say he really overdid the suffering. I find the best way to read this book is to take it with a grain of salt -- and sort of accept the comedic aspect of it all. People all seem clownish, especially his father who wants him to get up and die for Ireland every now and then -- more often than not, in the middle of the night.
B00AC8ZJPQ|1.0|Good for teens who want to see teenage romance and adventures but totally lacking anything else.  I would not waste money on it.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|We need more games like this. I'm more of an open world dog person, but hey, this fulfills my needs as well! Keep up the good work Gameloft!
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|This is one terrible movie. It's just kind of a silly movie with no real plot. I found that the group of us just started talking over the movie after a while. Could have been good but just not worth paying for.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book was great and I really love Diary of a Wimpy Kid books. If there is number eight I would totally get it because Jeff Kinney writes great books. It looked just like a real Diary of a Wimpy Kid book. One of the best books I've ever read great job Jeff Kinney.
B008EK91XU|4.0|This story about a young man's journey to become one of the world's greatest swimmers, his reasons for retiring from competition at an early age and then his attempt to return to elite competitive swimming  kept me captivated. It highlights the enormous pressure placed on gifted athletes especially very young ones in Australia. On a very personal level Ian's descriptions of his relationship with water has helped me in my own attempt to get back into the pool. I have recently taken up swimming for health and fitness reasons and have frankly struggled. However snce reading how Ian &#34;senses&#34; the water each time he gets into a pool I have stopped fighting the water and have found my enjoyment of swimming increase.<br />This portrayal of Ian  Thorpe shows a dedicated, courageous, thoughtful, and self aware young man who just happens to be an amazing athlete and human being and who also has flaws just like the rest of us.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I rate this book like all other Diary of a Wimpy kid books. This is a great book to read in general, especially if you want a hook of a story and a good laugh!
B005KR6NJU|5.0|Great first season of the show, great way to start it off, I like it a whole lot. It is really amazing
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was addictive. I read it in one day and I must say,bravo. I haven't had a good book that made me this emotional in years.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|I got a &#34;Wow!  I wanted this!  I'll watch it tonight.&#34;  And an honest smile.  It was a great present, and just what he wanted.
B008VO3PA4|3.0|&#34;I Could Pee on this&#34; is cute and full of fluff, but if you're looking for something with teeth in it, something that will actually help you understand your favorite furry cat friend, this isn't the book for you, nor is it a keeper on your shelf of books you'll reread.  It's not intended to be.  It's funny.  It's obviously written by an author with a real love for cats, one who enjoys them for who and what he thinks they are, but who doesn't intend to take them seriously.  In other words, the title says it all.  Personally, I think cats deserve a better representative, someone who knows and has enjoyed their unique senses of humor, their loyalty, their clear adoration for their keeper or keepers (as in the ones who keep them safe from harm), the person  or people they miss when he or she is gone, whether it's for 15 minutes or 10 hours.  This is the someone they wait for at the garage door until you come home to them again, and they can find their purr once more.
1419705849|5.0|Among all the presents he got, this was the one he picked up and started &#34;using&#34; (reading) first, and didn't want to put down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had to force myself to put this down the night before Christmas so I could be somewhat conscious the next day. If it wasn't for the holiday, I would have sty up to red the whole thing. It was the first book where I found myself in tears with fear, hope and happiness. Not even Slammed or POR had his impact on me. For those that are considering buying Hopeless, just do it. You won't be disappointed.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I love that all of the songs were recorded live when filming, which means no touchups! Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway do a wonderful job singing through the broadway musical Les Miserables! I have not seen the movie yet, but I sure will soon!
B0079R8KO0|5.0|This cover provides solid protection for the Kindle Fire.<br />I think it is well worth the expense to have my Kindle safe.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I have to say that this soundtrack is awesome! I love it that it is completely A Capella! My favorite song from the whole album is Cups, I know, weird but it was a GREAT movie!
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|A good book, but being so short (maybe a little longer than a novella)robs it of some of the intricacy you expect from Sanderson.
0425263916|5.0|Can't wait till the next book come's out it was a great book ranks right up there with fifty shades of grey
B004WR125O|4.0|I bought this to complement my new Onkyo 717. Now can update firmware and stream Pandora.<br />Does what it is advertised to do. It was easy to set up.<br /><br />The receiver/amplifier only streams audio.<br />Now if I could stream video (Netflix or Amazon) through the receiver and this adapter instead of my DVD player, that would be fantastic.
034580404X|5.0|omg great book read it in less then 2 weeks all 3 books can't wait for the next set to come out
B006FO3ERQ|4.0|This book held my interest from beginning to end.  I couldn't put it down.  It made me aware of another disfunctional family and some sad, weird, people out there and there are some that, no matter what, make it to a successful life.
1452111014|5.0|This has to be one of the best things I have ever bought. I totally recommend buying this product ASAP, especially if you're a fan of Wreck-It Ralph.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Purchased this online for a little bit different Christmas album.  Whereas it's not my favorite Christmas album, it's enjoyable to hear.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I thought this movie would be funnier than it was. But, I liked it anyway. I probably wouldn't buy it for my movie collection.
B00000ITOY|5.0|I have to say, I didn't think this would be a very fun toy. \\"Oh boy,\\" I thought, \\"it teaches math concepts... Whee.\\" I took a chance, though, based on the many positive reviews here, and I'm glad I did. Our almost-two-year-old really likes this toy, and she plays with it enthusiastically for long stretches. You can see the brain wheels turning as she figures out different patterns and experiments with how it can be assembled.<br /><br />I could not be more pleased with the quality of the toy. All of the pieces are solid wood, not plywood or MDF. The base is thick and sturdy. The pieces are all sanded to a very smooth, satiny finish, and the stain is vibrant and colorful while still showing the grain of the wood. It is not made in China.<br /><br />A++
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I watched the magic of the musical in Boston when it first appeared on the scene.  I love listening to the CD, but you really need a visual for some of the songs.<br />Now, I have the DVD and I am thrilled!!  The cast is perfect; the music brings back many memories, and most of all, it continues to remind us that AIDS is real.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait!<br />I want too know what happens next.  The series must go on.<br />I love it. I love it.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|The watch was even better than we were expecting. Our son loves it and has worn it non-stop.  Great buy!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the first book so much that I was skeptical about the series continuing but this book had me up til 4am to finish it! Certainly a page turner and had just the right mix of action, suspense and teen romance. Definitely a must read for teens and middle schoolers. It was an easy read, just long enough to keep your attention and short enough for kids!
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love this BBC series! I had originally downloaded Season 2 totally oblivious that Season 1 was available (duh!). I ride my stationary bike while watching on my Ipad and I don't even really realize I'm working out. My only complaint is that there are only 3 shows!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Excellent - action from the start and full of surprises.  Several new twists in the story and some people we haven't heard about before.
B002VWNID6|1.0|Apparently there is a bad batch of DVDs for this movie.  I ordered the first one and it played until a certain point in the movie then jump back to the scene selection screen.  Sent back to Amazon got replacement.  Same thing happened.  So decided to order from another vendor.  Same thing happened with their movie too.  I know it is not my dvd player because all my other movies play fine plus I tried playing Robin Hood dvds on my other player and same thing happened.  So now I have two bad dvds and I am out about 10 bucks.  Afraid to reorder for fear of getting yet another bad dvd from this defective batch.
0062202081|4.0|My daughter loves it! It is her favorite singer. She was so happy Christmas morning b/c it was on her list.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover has written yet another amazing book!!!! She has an incredible gift. This books will leave you speechless. Be ready to go on an intense journey with Sky and Holder.
1400095204|5.0|My mother was very happy with this gift.  We lived in Nigeria for awhile when I was young, at the close of the war.  She truly enjoyed it.  Thank you!  Merry Christmas
B008FPOIT6|4.0|If you're tired of whodunit mysteries and action-adventure epics this book is delightful relief. Its unique setting is a bookstore and the plot involves a mysterious cult of closeted bibliophiles who range from San Francisco to New York and overseas. It's fun to read even though there's no terrorist plot or gruesome murder involved but it holds your interest with intrigue and a likable band of techno-geeks in search of the cult's secrets. I'd recommend it for adults and teen readers alike.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|When you talk about legends you have to include Bob Marley. Wonderful stuff he did before his untimely death. Bu he left behind his music for us to enjoy for years to come. Have even got my daughter to enjoy his music.
B001AQO3QA|4.0|I loved the packing, it comes in a book format with the discs safely inside. The video and audio quality of the movies are ok to good. for me who is a big fan of this series i am happy with this collection
B0063IH60K|3.0|there are a lot of ads but I only get them when I start a new game and I have a tablet. sometimes it erases a game I am playing, but it rarely happens. all and all its not bad for being free.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Couldn't put this book down, best book I've read in a long time. You won't be disappointed, especially if you enjoy stories about family, love, and friendship.
B000NY12CI|5.0|Not light entertainment, but compelling. As one of my book club members wrote before our October meeting:  &#34;I see so many topics we can discuss: fundamentalist religions, child rearing and corporal punishment, arranged marriages, integrating immigrants into a new society, the obligations of the welfare state, women's education, tribalism, despotism, etc., etc.  You all probably have more.&#34; And we did, of course, including the courage and determination of Ayaan Hirsi as she moved back and forth between the ignorance and cruelty of what life is for a girl child in a world where women are owned by men and her unfolding experience of the dangers to a woman who moves toward freedom for herself and other women. I read this with my heart in my mouth and cheered for her final triumph.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game makes you judge your own analytical skills. It's so much fun and addicting I'm glad I got for free.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is Colleen Hoover's at her best. I could not put it down.Bittersweet and beautiful story.  Great characters, unpredictable events.  What a great read!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Britney Snow and Anna Kendrick shower scene was aca-awesome! Definitely recommend for those who like Glee. Watch this movie, all of the singing in it was great. Not to mention Rebel Wilson was amazing as well.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|-  A recap of the last 24 hrs is needed - snowfall, rainfall amounts, etc.<br /><br />-  Radar images need to be improved
B001HOF8AA|5.0|It is a shame that the best rockabilly is coming out of Europe. This is another great album from Imelda May. If you enjoy Imelda May try The Baboons, Devil Doll, The Deadbillys, and Hillbilly moon explosion.
B009VSW15Y|4.0|It is a very good camera app I am just disappointed that Amazon made us buy a camera app other than that it is perfect
B000000OF6|5.0|I actually purchased this for my kids and they play it constantly. We listen to it quite a bit, that and the Pixies-go figure.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This was the best Clancy book in years. I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book whether your a Clancy fan or not.
B0017TFLBQ|3.0|I love Heroes 3. I am not enjoying 4 as much. I believe the amount of info on the disc is causing loading and freezing issues. Still a great game.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Well I think it is a good game because it is like Minecraft.<br />Other games that are a copyright and trying to take the credit for what Mojang did. And because they did that I get a little MAD because I spent money on that specific game. So I advise you by this game instead of some copyright.
B00942S4OY|4.0|It Was just The Way that Was described.<br />Well packaged.<br />Good quality<br />The chart inside was too simple and tôo thin
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter loves this! She got a kindle fire for Christmas and this was the first ap we downloaded. I'm sure we will be purchasing more.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved every page<br /><br />Can't wait to start reading the next book:) it was delicious I couldn't put the book down
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you are a horror fan this series is for you.The acting is great and the story is better I love how the plot slowly unfolds,sort of like a soap opera for horror!
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|first off the movie was great, it follows to the plot of the overall RE story. maybe a little to much action? a few bad \\"jokes\\", still good. Alice, the ass was fat
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Great game. Easy to play on the Kindle Fire. Graphics are nice. A lot of playing hours. I really enjoy playing this game.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The title says it all. We couldn't be happier. The pic quality was top notch and the content is probably some of the best nature material I've seen yet.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Who wants to clog counter space with a big ol' knife sharpener?<br /><br />Not me!<br /><br />Who wants to pay a lot of money for a knife sharpener?<br /><br />Not me!<br /><br />And not you, either, given your visit to this product page. I have to heartily recommend to you, frugal shopper, this knife sharpener. It's inexpensive, compact, well-designed AND IT SHARPENS KNIVES!<br /><br />I have had nary an issue with this.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The plot kept changing and was unpredictable right up to the end. I read it twice and stil found some surprises
B008XCJ03K|5.0|Hadn't heard of Passenger before but took a listen and a leap when this album was $5.  This is an excellent album and one of the best I've heard or bought in the last year.
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|Frankenweenie is an amazing movie that is a bit like Lassie and a bit like Frankenstein, but with Tim Burton's touch. The original film was really good and I feel that this new film is faithful to the old film, while still bringing things to the table. Each character in the film is unique and memorable. ParaNorman and Hotel Translyvania have both been compared to this film because of the clay mation and darker nature, but this film can hold its own. Personally, Hotel Translyvania is very far weaker than Frankenweenie. ParaNorman and Frankenweenie are both equal. However, Frankenweenie is one of the best films of the year.
B008SOS63S|5.0|I've been following Joe since his opening album and have dutifully bought every album he's put out since.  This album in particular is easily one of Joe's best - live or studio.  The song selection and guests are what really make this album stand out; Live from Nowhere in Particular is a great album and Live from Royal Albert Hall is good, but this one definitely eclipses both IMO.<br /><br />If you're looking at all three live albums and can't decide which one to get, buy this one. No questions asked.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|The game is one of the best of the vita console, it's very similar to the PS2 version, for those who never played the saga, it's and turn based combat rpg and sometimes looks like shenmue since it takes place in a small town in japan.
B00786XVOG|5.0|Good value for the money and OK service.  Good value for the money and OK service.  Good value for the money and OK service.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Amazing price, 2 seasons for 1, can't be beat. Obviously the show is amazing, and I enjoyed the extra special features.
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|I'm going to start playing but it would be helpful if I could read.  I look forward to enjoying it
B008N1V11U|5.0|For all you Batman lover's (me) you will love this game. I just hope they make Bane break Batman's back again to be more epic!
B006G2ZEV6|1.0|I'm going to start playing but it would be helpful if I could read.  I look forward to enjoying it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved it!!! Lots of passion, angst and twists and turns. Had me crying which means it's goooood! Read it. You won't regret it!
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Reminds me of Kings Quest (old DOS game). Engaging for hours and actually forces you to evolve your game style as you go, you end up finding a storyline and a desire to return.  Highly encourage it for casual hours or even a.quickie battle just for experience.
B007MU85D0|4.0|A couple songs got me hooked on Pandora and after previewing the album bought the whole thing and haven't regretted it. Solid first album and looking forward to a followup hopefully.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app for almost a year now and have had no problems.  It provides exactly what I need and is easy to use.  The feature set is plentiful and I enjoy using the app to read instead of trying to figure out how to use the app.
B000VHMF0A|5.0|You can't go wrong with Bob Marley...especially at .99 cents, Merry Christmas to me.  A must have in anyone's music collection.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book touched me in so many ways.  Anyone who had to survive this as a child will understand that things happen to good people.  It's our choice to survive and there also those who can't bare one more day.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this app on all my tablets, Pcs and phones. I use it daily and marvel at its efficiency.  I recommend it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|its funner than the original weeds my. water, Cu's it has funny yet random &quot;messages&quot; from the other charictors. so ya.
B0091REZMW|3.0|a little confusing! lots of energy required to enter rooms which don't let you play longtime unless you are willing to purchase more stuff.so game is truely not free ;)
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|...the previews showed the only parts of the movie that were actually funny. I was expecting a movie that would keep me laughing; instead, my husband and I spent the first half hour or so wondering when the movie was going to really get funny. I'm glad we didn't pay movie theater prices to see this one.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What an amazing book. I couldn't put it down. I do hope there will be another to follow. Soon. :)
B009HV2JT8|4.0|The movie was a nice change up on the vampire theme. Love all things Lincoln, and this did not disappoint.
