0446581348|4.0|This was a fun Makeup Manual to look through and get ideas for makeup applications. I especially liked the step-by-step directions complete with photographs to follow along. I learned a few things about eye concealer as I have under-eye darkness and learned that choosing the right corrector color is based upon tone. I liked that Bobbi Brown focused on how lifestyle and nutrition are vital components to beautiful skin. There are many suggestions that are practical and useful reminders that what we eat and drink does effect our skin.     There is a recommended Ten-Step guide to perfect makeup that should only take five to ten minutes. I haven't tried it as I don't put on full makeup daily. This does seem like a simple routine if you are looking for a quick and effective makeup routine.  The Makeup Manual also gives suggestions for diversity in skin types as well as for bridal makeup, special occasion makeup, teen makeup, makeup during pregnancy and even for \\"bad-day\\" beauty ideas. There is a whole section of the book geared toward professional makeup artists which would be an asset for someone in that business. One thing that I didn't find in this book were any references to Mineral Makeup. This is becoming more popular as a natural style of makeup as well as a greener, less toxic product.I would have liked to hear Bobbi Brown's opinion on mineral makeup.

B0013GUKDC|4.0|Diary of a Wimpy Kid is one of my son's favorite book series. How could I say no to reading this book when my 10 year old son put this book on my nightstand and asked me to read it? I have to say that I really did enjoy this funny book about a boy named Gregory in middle school (the 6th grade). Gregory's mother bought him a diary over the summer and he actually wanted a journal as he didn't like the idea of a diary as he thought that was for girls. The book is about his daily entries in the diary along with comics that complement the tales he writes about.     Gregory has a regular family, mom and dad an older brother Rodrick who is in high school and a younger brother Manny who is in preschool. Rodrick has a band and for the most part they get along with a few typical brotherly tricks up their sleeves. Gregory seems to be a bit jealous of Manny as he seems to get away with almost everything and gets most everything he wants. Gregory also writes about experiences with his best friend Rowley. Gregory has some interesting insights and thoughts on his life experiences, some good and some bad. He learns along the way about friends, bullies, being popular and what happens when you're not always honest and that it usually catches up with you.

0810994739|4.0|A Parents Review:      Diary of a Wimpy kid: Rodrick Rules is the sequel to Diary of a Wimpy Kid and the second in the series. As I shared in my review of Diary of a Wimpy Kid, that this is one of my son's favorite book series. My son who is 10, was so happy that I read the first book and when I finished it, he lined up book 2 and 3 in the series on my nightstand. What mother could say no to that?!     This book picks up after summer vacation when school starts for Gregory. He continues writing in his diary or as he prefers to call it a journal as diaries are for girls. The book is largely focused on Gregory's escapades with his older brother Rodrick who is in high school and has a band called the \\"loded diaper\\". Rodrick knows a secret about Gregory, something that happened over summer vacation that Gregory does not want anyone to know. So, Gregory ends up helping Rodrick with his homework and covering his share of chores to avoid his \\"secret\\" from being exposed. His secret is finally exposed but as things turn out it isn't as bad as Gregory thinks it will be as the story gets twisted in translation. Gregory is turned into a hero and Mr. popularity and he never expected that. These books address issues that kids often deal with including teasing, bullying, sibling rivalry and more. If you read it along with your child, you can discuss these issues with them. It has the kind of humor that kids like and adults often do as well.
B001DUKHXQ|5.0|In the untimely death of Michael Jackson I immediately began to purchase any and all items before the prices were out of my range.  I ordered this item from Amazon and for whatever reason I had to wait sometime on it to arrive.  I had arrived home one day to find a package at my residence and when I opened the item at first I thought it was a magazine and I said to myself I did not order a magazine.  To my surprise I pulled out this LP record.  I thought to myself OH SNAP!!!!!!  I thought I had ordered the Thriller CD but it was the LP record which was even better.  I took it to work and showed it off, my co-workers were just as impressed as I was.  I was asked do I plan on playing it and I said no.  I plan on having it framed!! This is and will be the best selling album of all time and I want to keep it in the best condition possible.  MJ once said he wanted to make music that will last for generations and he has done just that.  MJ thank you for the great music and memories!!!!
B00004XMTJ|5.0|This has GOT to be my most favorite musical of all time!  Based off of T.S. Elliot's 'Old Possum's book of Practical Cats',  I've seen this show at LEAST six times in my life since its incarnation in 1981.  Sir Andrew Llyod Webber has done a fantastic job bringing these \\"papercats\\" to life, and the theater is truly fortunate and blessed to have these elite performers \\"strutting their stuff\\" on the stage.  From The Rum Tum Tugger to Grizabella, the Glamour Cat and the magical, mystical Mister Mistoffelees and of course the old, wise and gentle Old Deuteronomy and MY personal favorite, Gus the Theatre Cat, and ALL of the Cats in between, this is a visual and audio feast not to be missed.  Every time I hear the song \\"Memory\\", I can't help but cry.  All the other Cats shun Grizabella because of her controversial past.  But in the end, they come to love and accept her.  The choreagraphy is stellar and the special effects, lighting, and prop design is exceptionally clever.  Whether you're in the privacy of your own home watching or in the public theater, you're in for a memorable treat!  Thank you, Cats!

B000OIZUW6|5.0|I'm going to make this review short and sweet, since there's not much to be said here. Jackdaws is the second novel of Ken Follett's that I read after Eye of the Needle, and I think it was just as good. I was hooked during every single part of the story, the characters were very distinct and original, and I felt a really strong connection with the protagonists. I knew I was reading a really good story, since I would be thinking to myself \\"What's going to happen to Flick Clairet?\\" all day during work! I've read a handful of Ken Follett's books so far, and I have a lot to go, but this one's at the top with Eye of the Needle in my opinion.
0743298039|5.0|This was a book that i was would have never picked up myself.  It was a pick from amazon that showed up.  I read a little bite and said what the heck. It did prove to be interesting and challenged the readers abilities to guess what would happen next, which I am really good at when it comes to movie and books.  Sadly this one I failed to do so. There fore I must say that I truly like this book.
B000FGGE68|3.0|I saw this movie in a discounted movie theatre (ya know, $.99 cent tickets, $8 dolar popcorn sold) and it was worth the price I paied for it (which was again...99 cents)    The movie will confuse the heck out of alot of people from the start and may just disinterest more throughout.     Having bowling balls shoot assassins into a building and then dropping the scientists does set the tone for the kind of movie you will see. And what guy wouldn't want to see Mila kicking some serious butt either. She can wear whatever she pleases as well!! :)    This was eyecandy and the fighting scenes were awsome. The guards with the energy rods (?) did rather suck when they attacked her. She moped the floor easy. She then mops the floor with all the other guards before jumping off the building at the helicopter shooting at her. Oh yeah, the suitcase held a kid???     It becomes boring when it switches from the mindless fighting until the action keeps up again. The story just wasn't there at all. The part where she takes down 3 rows of guards with weapons drawn already was a little too much for me though. She just seemed to kick everybody's butt too quickly.     Overall, an average movie with no balance between action and story.
1400032717|5.0|Whether Haddon is spot on when it comes to illustrating the main character's autism or not, as a handful of previous reviewers on Amazon.com have questioned, what the author masters in \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is the plight of a square peg type of personality trying to fit into the world's round hole.<br /><br />Haddon, who had a solid background working with autistic children before writing this book, has certainly assimilated his observations and masterfully portrayed them so vividly that any reader can get an inkling of what it feels like to live in an autistic--or a \\"hijacked\\" brain.<br /><br />I think the most poignant aspect of \\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time\\" is the unconditional love portrayed by two \\"imperfect\\" parents toward their son.  It gave me a sense of gratitude that compared to raising someone like Christopher, my parenting dilemmas are next to nil.  With this fact alone in mind, I would recommend the book not only to parents who have a child with Asperger Syndrome, but to any parent who knows how it is to raise \\"individual-minded\\" kids in a prescribed society.

B002G4FQI4|5.0|Although well-known and respected prior, George Benson's 1976 million-selling album \\"Breezin',\\" with its Record Of The Year Grammy Award winning cover of Leon Russell's \\"This Masquerade,\\" almost single-handedly created the genre of contemporary/smooth jazz. Approximately 33 1/3 years later his new CD \\"Songs And Stories\\" proves he is still the master of the form and is still in top form both instrumentally and vocally.<br /><br />Flawlessly produced and brilliantly recorded, \\"Songs And Stories\\" presents us with tunes by great writers such as James Taylor (\\"Don't Let Me Be Lonely Tonight,\\") Rod Temperton of Heatwave and \\"Thriller\\" fame (\\"Family Reunion\\"), Bill Withers (\\"A Telephone Call Away\\",) Tony Joe White (\\"Rainy Night In Georgia\\"), Smokey Robinson (\\"One Like You\\") and Christopher Cross (\\"Sailing\\"), all with those special, smooth George Benson vocals and guitar.<br /><br />If George's presence alone is not enough for you, he has surrounded himself with a \\"who's who\\" of studio musicians and vocalists including co-producer Marcus Miller on bass, Greg Phillinganes and Rod Temperton on keyboards, Tom Scott and Gerald Brown on saxophones, Wah Wah Watson and Norman Brown on guitars, Paulinho Da Costa on perccussion and Lalah Hathaway and Patti Austin on featured and background vocals. Not surprisingly everyone is at the top of their game and George Benson is not afraid to step back and let them shine.<br /><br />There is not a weak cut on the CD but my special favorites are \\"Show Me The Love\\" in which, for all intents and purposes, George becomes a member of Toto, the truly soulful rendition of Donny Hathaway's \\"Someday We'll All Be Free,\\" the wonderful horn arrangement from Tom Scott on \\"Come In From The Cold,\\" and the extended swinging tour-de-force \\"Living In High Definition\\" with its perfect cooling down successor \\"Sailing.\\"<br /><br />George Benson invented the formula and could just phone it in as some of his fellow smooth jazz artists sadly do and it would still work. But this is a vivid, engaging, energizing and delicious musical confection. Still breezin' after all these years - and we the listeners are the better for it.ing, energizing and delicious musical confection.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|MOVIE. The best cinematic adaptation of a comic book story.  It is also one of the best sequels ever made, right up there with THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  Sections are inspired by quality elements of genre greats like HEAT and the James Bond series.  Rare in-camera visual effects work.  The first BATMAN film, with Nicholson's Joker, doesn't have anything on this version.  Stunning.<br /><br />VIDEO. Filmed partly in 70mm Imax and 35mm, this is a tour de force in crime genre filmmaking, and the best filmed superhero movie ever.  The 35 scenes don't look as good as the 70 scenes, but it's a surprisingly subtle shift.  Altogether the filming is comparable to Kubrick's photographic innovations.  Fully utilizes the capabilities of Blu-ray in transferring what is likely the greatest technical achievement in filmmaking in recent years.<br /><br />AUDIO.  The fact that the score is by TWO of the best film soundtrack composers working today seems under-appreciated or overlooked in the reviews I've read.  This unique collaboration between Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard is reason enough to own the BD.  Some have complained that Batman's voice doesn't sound right, which is incorrect.  Batman uses a voice synthesizer to change his voice to be menacing and untraceable.  There is plenty of LFE and while the soundstage could have used some more kick and surround in some parts, it was overall very good.  It's unfortunate that the BD defaults to \\"Dolby Multi\\" 5.1 rather than the superior TrueHD audio track.<br /><br />EXTRAS.  Amazingly there are no audio commentary tracks.  The \\"focus point\\" shorts on disc one are the best extras, demonstrating how some of the incredible pieces of this film came together.  The special features disc is pretty fluffy, though parts of the HD documentaries were enjoyable.  The Gotham news scenes dragged on but there are a couple highlights, like Bruce Wayne's comments whilst eating sushi.  The design of the case and sleeve deserve mention as they are the most creative I've seen on any BD or DVD.  The slipcase looks normal while the case underneath features the joker on front and his graffiti on the back, defacing what was presented normally on the sleeve.<br /><br />OVERALL.  It's a fun movie to watch.  Highest recommendation.seen on any BD or DVD.

B002GY9F9K|3.0|I came upon this show in the cable guide. I had never heard of it before but I thought the episode info sounded a little intriguing.   I wasn't sure about it but thought the storyline sounded kind of cool so I taped it.. I was impressed. There are cheesy parts but you get over them after you get pulled into the story of magick, spells, wizardry, etc. There is action and it does get a little sexy too. It's all very fantastical.   It feeds the imagination...If you watch one episode and you don't like it, watch a couple more, and you just might become hungry for more...

It's not supposed to be \\"art\\" its ENTERTAINMENT and it excels at that all throughout the movie.
B00001SIES|5.0|Like a lot of people I was first introduced to Muse through reading the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. Since she drew so much inspiration from their music I was curious to check them out. My first stop was Wikipedia, where I learned as much as I could about the band themselves, then I hopped on over to Amazon, where I listened to sound samples from most of their albums. It's fair to say I liked what I heard.    Showbiz is surprisingly solid for a debut release. From the opening notes of Sunburn to the closing, this is definitely a worthwhile album. There are no songs onthe CD that I actually dislike, although I like some less than others. Particular favorites of mine are Sunburn, Muscle Museum (which has one of the coolest basslines ever as well as some of the coolest lyrics), Cave, Showbiz, Unintended, Uno, Sober and Overdue. I'll grant that the band's sound and Matt Bellamy's vocals bear some similarity to Radiohead, but unlike Radiohead I was instantly hooked on Muse. About the only song of Radiohead's I really like is Creep, and even that got seriously overplayed on the radio. But I liked Muse enough to buy all their albums, well except for HAARP and the as yet unreleased new album, which I do intend to own at some point. All in all a great start for a great band.
006135323X|4.0|Predictably Irrational belongs to the category of books such as Nudge by Thaler and Sunstein, and Bounded rationality: The adaptive toolbox by Gigerenzer. You'll find similar examples in the books by those authors and maybe in more detail so why another book on a similar subject? Maybe it is because Dan Ariely concentrated on behavioral economics after a very critical and painful personal experience. Or maybe because he is the professor from MIT with a very keen sense of humour when it comes to explaining his examples. Or can it be because he generally relates different modes of 'irrationality' to his life, too?<br /><br />If you haven't read any book from Gigerenzer, Thaler, Sunstein, etc. then Predictably Irrational may be a very good start to understand what this behavioral economics stuff is all about. I guess living afer (or in the middle of) a global economic crisis gives people opportunities to question the assumptions that they didn't even realize they held. This may be one of the reasons why these kind of books and research became very popular.<br /><br />So if you want a good and non-academic headstart in behavioral economics this book is fine as a first choice. If you want to learn and understand more about the field please invest some time in Gigerenzer's, Kahneman's and Tversky's work, too.<br /><br />Your reward will be a much better understanding of human nature and you'll be much more suspicious of classical economic theories, rational agent based assumptions and the 'virtues' of free markets.
1440468397|5.0|Persuasion was Jane Austen's final novel. It is often criticized for being too short and not up to par with Austen's other novels. Persuasion was in fact written during the onset of the disease that eventually killed the author. Her final novel may indeed be considered different from her previous novels. It is the only Austen novel where the female protagonist is close to becoming a spinster. Persuasion is a very different type of novel with a love story told in retrospect, an unexpected villain, and an unintentional, but very bad piece of advice that negatively impacts many lives.     The main protagonist in this book is Anne Elliot. Anne is the middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot. Sir Elliot was once a man of property and weath, but his ostentatious manner of living has considerably dimished his fortune. The great Elliot family retain only a much respected name and a fine estate named Kellynch Hall. Sir Walter is forced to confront his inability to retain the standard of living once enjoyed at the estate. He is asked to consider many options, including trimming down the number of servants, but all options seem appalling to the proud Sir Elliot.    Under the advice of a family friend, Sir Elliot agrees to let Kellynch Hall and retire to Bath with his eldest and middle daughter. Sir Elliot is not the only one in the family who takes the advice of  the much respected Lady Russell, a widow and friend of the deceased Lady Elliot.     Anne Elliot was once engaged and very much in love with a poor, but honorable naval officer named Frederick Wentworth. Anne, however, broke off the engagement after Lady Russell convinced her that it would be a grave mistake for a young lady of her station to marry someone so far beneath her.    Eight lonely years go by for Anne, and the years have not been kind to her. The author writes that her beauty has considerably dimished. One who may have known Anne years ago would hardly find her recognizable. Over the years, Anne has forced herself not to think \\"of that person\\" as Anne often refers to Frederick Wentworth.  The reader is immediately aware of Anne's lingering feelings for the man she heartlessly and foolishly rejected.    She is forced to confront her feelings when the family that leases Kellynch Hall turn out to be relations of  now wealthy Captain Wentworth. There is much awkwardness and dread as Anne prepares to face the man she once loved and let go. Captain Wenworth, however, appears indifferent and one would hardly suspect from his cold behavior towards Anne that the two were ever even acquainted!    Throughout the novel Anne desperately looks for and finds small little details in Captain Wentworth behavior that the love he had for her has not diminished entirely. But can he forgive her for snubbing him?     I absolutely adored this novel about the one who got away, but there is so much more to the story than just Anne and Captain Wentworth. The book is full of lively characters, such as Anne's pompous father, her self-indulgent sister, Elizabeth, and many others. Most people are aquainted with Austen's Pride and Prejudice and Emma, but Persuasion should be recognized for the fine novel that it is.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Sicko starts off disturbingly with sick people who cannot afford healthcare. Michael Moore then goes off to Canada, the UK, France and Cuba to see what people think of their health care systems. In Britain, he interviews veteran politician, Tony Benn, remembered for giving up his privileged name - Sir Anthony Wedgewood Benn, so that he could serve the common people in the House of Commons.  In the outtakes there are more Tony Benn comments.<br /><br />It's easy for conservatives to dismiss Benn as a radical socialist by American standards, but hear him out. Benn explains very clearly the impetus for Britain's National Health service, as he is old enough to remember its inception. His lucid arguments in favor of nationalized health care by an experienced politician, not subject to term limits, should be heard by anyone who has to vote on healthcare reform.  Moore asks penetrating questions, Benn gives clear answers.

0316017922|5.0|In my opinion Malcolm Gladwell's books have improved progressively since 'The Tipping Point', which became a bit repetitive towards the end.  'Outliers' read like a real page-turner, although it is pure non-fiction, and resulted in many pleasantand stimulating dinner-table conversations.  I have recommended it to several friends, who have, interestingly enough, found something applicable to their very different lives.  A most readable and eventually inspiring book!

0446698342|4.0|The Lucky One was the first Nicholas Sparks novel I read. I really enjoyed the book... I have since learned that it takes his stories a little while to pick up (if at all), but this one is worth the wait. I personally enjoy the whole soulmate/destiny idea, so I liked that about this book. The book kind of reminds me of the movie Hope Floats. I have also read Nights in Rodanthe which I did not like at all- I finished it just to see how it ended, I found it too boring. I just read At First Sight, which I also did not enjoy. The Lucky One was by far the best of the three and I would recommend it even if you aren't his biggest fan.

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|'Accelerate' is quite simply the best thing REM have done since 'New Adventures', and possibly since 'Automatic for the People'. Cynics might argue that's not saying much, but 'Accelerate' is a strong album and a welcome return to form for the band.     Rather than persue the over-produced art pop of their last three albums, REM go back to basics to reinvigorate themselves. They strip away the electronics, keyboards and heavy production, and push the guitars and vocals to the fore. The result is their most straightforward rock album since the late 80's. In many ways, 'Lifes Rich Pageant' and 'Document' are the templates for the album, both in the direct rock sound and the strident, often political, lyrics. Fans of these albums will find plenty to love on 'Accelerate'.    The one criticism I would have is that perhaps they've gone too far, stripping away not only the fuzzy electro influences of 'Up', but also the quirks that made up their signature sound. It's a very direct album, with little of the subtlety and detours of their classic work. As for the politics, I'd suggest it's not exactly brave or subversive to attack GWB when he's on the way out. Nevertheless, 'Accelerate' is a very good album; the comeback REM fans began to fear they'd never make.
B00000DGUY|4.0|This \\"best of\\" compilation is better than Dire Straight's previous one, MONEY FOR NOTHING. The MONEY FOR NOTHING compilation did not include \\"Lady Writer\\" or \\"So Far Away\\", two of my favorites, and both tunes are included here.<br /><br />But both SULTANS OF SWING: THE VERY BEST OF and MONEY FOR NOTHING do not include \\"Industrial Disease\\", which was one of their biggest hit singles.  When I saw Dire Straights in concert at the Montreal Forum back in the mid-80s, they didn't include \\"Industrial Disease\\" in the set either.  It makes me wonder what Mark Knopfler and the boys have against the song?
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This was such a great movie. I had absolutely no problems with the subtitles as many others had. I purchased this movie on the recommendation of a collegue of mine. The story is simply beautiful. First you are introduced to a young boy who is being terribly bullied and then you're introduced to a girl who seems very mysterious. Both boy and girl becomes friends and soon the boy seems to fall for the girl. What I like is the innocence of this movie. Nothing sexually provaocative but obvious in its intentions to show how two young children or young teens like one another. The only problem is one of them happens to be a vampire. I love the fact that you're never told how this younglin becomes a vampire and you're not told how old the vampire really is. However you are often left to wonder because of the maturity of the young vampire.<br /><br />The best part of the movie is the end. In which I won't give away. But it shows what true love and friendship is really about. Risk.<br /><br />The movie is quiet and shot mostly in the cold of winter. Which gives an eerie but young feel to it. It also opens opportunity for trouble for the young vampire. This is not Trueblood or Twlight (which I really dislike). It is a beautiful independent film that shows the humanity behind fangs in a different way.<br /><br />The DVD I have had deleted scenes, commentary from the director, and different audio and language selections. As I said, I had absolutely no problem with the subtitles.<br /><br />I think the movie may disappoint some moviewatchers who have to be constantly spoonfed every single little thing and so they may feel something was left out. But for the rest of us who like to think...it is a beautiful story indeed.
B000084H8X|5.0|What can I say.  A great soundtrack.  Very engaging sound listenting to this SACD.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Excellent series.  Mad Men cover the time period excellently.  The characters are developed along with the story line and continue to make me a committed viewer.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Loved the story and the animation. I had to watch it in regular   2-d however. I tried the 3-d version with the glasses provided and could get nothing out of it and just found it annoying. My eyes, or did others feel the same. I had read the reviews which raved about the 3-d effects? Perhaps it had to be seen in a theater outfitted for 3-d.
B001OQCV2Y|5.0|After 25 years, Quentin Tarantino is still cranking out violent, caustic, talky movies for himself. Til now. Now he's making movies for us. For you. Now he's made a classic. Once upon a time, in Nazi-occupied France, during World War II, a group of Jewish-American soldiers known as \\"The Basterds\\" are chosen specifically to spread terror throughout the Third Reich by scalping and brutally killing German Nazis. The Basterds eventually cross paths with a pretty French-Jewish teenage girl whose family was brutally murdered by Col. Hans Landa. She now owns a movie theater in Paris which the Basterds have targeted for attack. Pre-1950 nitrate film is highly flamable and can easily start a fire. They all have a plan. Blow up the theater during a Nazi propaganda film-screening; killing Goebbels, German film star Emil Jannings, and even a flinty-nosed hard-tack named Hitler. But will it work? In \\"Inglorious Basterds\\" Tarantino is equipted with all his usual apparatus: a flying, burning cigarette in slow-motion, homage to Hollywood B-Pictures of the 1940's, women's foot fetishes(see Erich von Stroheim), two-and-three character extended dialogue sequences, cameo parts for former Hollywood stars, and brutal, gruesome violence. But here, for the first time, Tarantino's bag of tricks has purpose: a serio-comic surreal war-drama that is no war movie. In \\"Ingl. B\\", the horrors of the German Holocaust have become contagious; American Allied troups inflict cruelties on German soldiers; bestial atrocities that mirror their Nazi counterparts. Brad Pitt stars as Lt. Aldo Raine, a sadistic murderer who smiles while his soldiers scalp German soldiers. Christoph Waltz is amazing and sublime as the precise, ruthless, decadent German Nazi Colonel Hans Landa. We perhaps have not seen a more tortuous, calculated villian. And Melanie Laurent as Shosanna Dreyfus is delicate as fine porcelain; hardy as cold steel; a French-Jewish Freedom-Fighter whose mission is soon revealed. Laurent is electrifying, trembling, and mostly vulnerable. A few cameo parts are reserved for former movie greats. Film comedian Mike  Myers has 45-seconds as an English officer, and once-famous Rod Taylor is seen briefly as Winston Churchill. Film buff Tarantino loads \\"Basterds\\" with his most cinema-history-laden screenplay ever. We watch 35mm film projectors being mounted and operated. Shosanna's movie theater marquee advertises European film comedian Max Linder. The German soldiers chant for Charlie Chaplin, who directed the famous chase at the end of \\"The Kid\\". Other film references include German actors Pola Negri, Emil Jannings, and director G.W. Pabst. \\"Basterds\\" was filmed on location in Babelsberg, Potsdam, and Brandenburg, Germany. Last June, I journeyed to Hollywood, and one hot Saturday, I stumbled into the old Musso and Frank's on Hollywood Blvd.. Sitting at the counter, the woman next to me mumbled: \\"They told me in there is the man who directed something called \\"Pulp\\" something...\\" Turing the corner, I entered the writer's back room. Lunching with his buddies, there sat the tall Quentin Tarantino himself. He was describing to his friends the theme of a George Sanders World War II movie from 1940. Fortified with a glass of merlot, I approached his table. Quentin was cordial and friendly. I told him I liked his controversial \\"Death-Proof\\". We shared a joke and I left. He back to his friends. I back to my Merlot.I could not have known. He could not have guessed. In just two months his new movie would reign supreme as box-office No. 1. In the very last scene of \\"Inglourious Basterds\\", Brad Pitt's Lt. Raine commits one more atrocious, fiendish act. He stops. He lears. He looks straight down into the camera, and says: \\"Well, yeah, I don't know, but this just might be my masterpiece.\\"
B0026RHR6K|1.0|BSG is a terrific series, and deserves to be seen from beginning to end, but this collection is not the way to do it. I could see that the overall packaging was ridiculous when I ordered it, but I figured I'd just take the individual season boxes and throw the rest away. Unfortunately, the individual season boxes are paper, not hard plastic, and the dividers within them had already started to collapse by the time I opened the package. So I threw out everything except the disks and put them in my own plastic sleeves. Now, as I watch the DVDs I'm realizing that many of them are scratched, probably from putting them into such exotic packaging instead of using standard DVD holders. I could have saved myself a lot of trouble by just getting the individual season packages. Do NOT buy this product.
0307454541|5.0|If you like dark psychological thrillers, but intelligent, literary ones, this is the book for you.  Skillful character development, well-researched and many-tiered subplots.  I simply could not put this book down, and started the next book of the series as soon as I had finished \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\"  I cannot wait for the third and final book in the trilogy to be translated/published.  Unfortunately, we cannot look forward to any more books like this from this fine author.  Stief Larsson author died of a massive heart attack at age 50 shortly after delivering the three manuscripts in this series to his publisher.
B00132D808|2.0|Panic! at the Disco ..turned Easy Listening?  Can't say that I like it.  The over-the-top energy in the first album is what made it great.  Pretty.Odd is a very skillfully done album but its a big departure from Fever.  Some people like when a band shows that sort of range but in this case Panic dropped the exclamation point and jumped into a genre that I don't care for.  In effect, I just don't like the album.  Its very drone and similar while being far too heavily influenced.  On top of it all, most of this album is very forgettable (no distinction).  While I can throw in 'A Fever You Can't Sweat Out' and get the whole car singing along and bouncing off the windows... if I played Pretty.Odd, the car would either be in a daze or asleep by the time the trip was over.  Again, the reason I like(d) Panic! at the Disco is for the energy and wacky style that really worked well in their debut.    To each their own but I don't see how fans of the first album could be excited about Pretty.Odd.  Panic's two releases are just such a departure that nothing but blind loyalty should put these two efforts in the same album collection.  Well, unless said fan had an extremely broad range of musical taste.  Guess thats not me.
B002C6A6F4|5.0|This is such an amazing movie and being a big fan of Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana it satisfied me a lot. I loved how it started out with Miley as Hannah thinking that she was going to go to New York for a performance at an awards show, but her father surprisingly flies her to where she is born Tennessee. I enjoy all the wonderful moments of father/daughter bonding between Miley and her father Billy Ray Cyrus.                                It is wonderful to see Miley finding her true self and who she is back at home. She also realizes that it is becoming harder to be Hannah and Miley at the same time, and she wants to stop being Hannah and to remain Miley only. There are a lot of high moments, bonding with family and friends at Crowley Meadows. The music by Miley/Hannah is truly magnificent and the guest appearances are really cool. I love all the songs that Miley has in here, the funny and emotional parts especially when Miley goes to get eggs from the chickens and when she sings \\"Butterfly Fly Away\\" with her father is such a touching moment.                    I truly enjoy when she starts \\"Rock Star\\" towards the end of the movie, and then realizes she can't be Hannah anymore, stops singing, tells everyone she is really Miley Stewart, and then goes into a powerful performance of her amazing-inspirational song \\"The Climb.\\" This movie is such a wonderful mixture of self discovery, putting aside who you were, deciding what is really important, comedy, and emotional moments.                    The bonus features are truly amazing especially seeing Miley walking around the small-town where she was born Franklin, Tennessee. I also love the deleted scene where Miley is on the porch strumming the chords to \\"Butterfly, fly Away\\", while talking to her dad (I wish they would've kept that scene in the movie.) I give it 5 stars, because Miley is truly amazing both singing and acting wise, and all the music is truly wonderful. The movie was so amazing that it kept me so hooked on it that I couldn't stop watching it, and I have watched about six times already. I also love that they included the video for \\"The Climb\\" on the bonus features.                   Miley is so amazing and talented, she kept me really mesmerized with her music and acting in this movie adaptation of \\"Hannah Montana\\" that I will be able to watch it, many more times and never ever get tired of it. So if you're a Miley Cyrus and Hannah Montana like me, then you should buy this, because it is so worth it.
B00005ATQD|1.0|I guess the fact that this marriage ended right after this release shows us all that it is an evil film and should be avoided like the plague.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I rec'd the wrong DVD set in the mail and after a complaint, which I filed online through the site, my True Blood set was promptly sent out and I rec'd it a few days later.  I LOVE the series, so I was happy that they responded so quickly to the error.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|I got this for my y, and expected it to come after his birthday but showed up before. He loved it, thank you very much
0060853980|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend, and I went for it because I love Terry Pratchett's writing.  I have never read Neil Gaiman before, but after this I'm eager to get my hands on something of his.  I can feel the influences of both authors in the book, and the whole is cohesive and delightful in a fabulously dark way.  This edition also has extras at the end, including essays by the authors about one another and how they made the book.  I loved every page of this and will reread it many, many times.
031606792X|1.0|It would've been better to end the series with Eclipse.  I would've expected this storyline and quality of writing from a fourth grader, not a published author.  I was hoping for so much more from this book.  It was such a huge disappointment I don't see myself reading anything by Stephanie Meyer ever again.
0307269981|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book.  I haven't quite finished yet but what I really like is the fact that the author writes, and I experience what's going on.  I plan on reading The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo.  I've never been much of a book reader but i totally got hooked on this one.
B002E01LL6|1.0|I payed 15 bucks plus tax for this garbage movie. Lol! For the love of Christ these guys are good con artists. The freaking trailer looked like it would be a hell of a movie like someone else alerady said. Bad acting, Terrence Morris or whatever his name is used a terrible and gay irritating voice. The white guy can't even fight worth ish. He spends half the movie getting his tail kicked. The fights we're mediocre at best, even worst is the acting and lines. A horrific movie, please don't waste your time. The only bright spot about this movie is the hot latina chick. And I like latinas! That's why it earned a 1, otherwise I'd give it a freaking zero.
6300213803|5.0|You Won't Like Him When He's Angry<br /><br />The original series Star Trek films were an interesting study in what fans wanted versus what the directors wanted to produce.  Some were banal, some were exciting, and some were cursed.  Wrath of Khan is seen as one of the more exciting space adventures of Kirk and crew.<br /><br />As in the first film, \\"The Motion Picture\\", the script is based on an earlier episode of the original Trek, except \\"Wrath\\" could be called a sequel of sorts.<br /><br />The new USS Enterprise is going through its shake-down and Kirk, looking like he is destined for a desk job, takes a visit to \\"his\\" Enterprise.  Meantime, the Reliant is doing some exploring in the same area of space where Khan was exiled by Kirk many years ago (back in the Sixties don'tcha know).  Khan, expertly played in a reprisal role by Ricardo Montalban (Fantasy Island, etc)., still wants his revenge.  When the Reliant beam down a shore party, Khan recognizes Chekov and proceeds to take over the Reliant as a tool to find and kill Kirk.<br /><br />It's an interesting scene where Chekov is recognized by Khan, when Chekov was not in the earlier Sixties episode.  Oops.<br /><br />Not only do we have the cat & mouse game between Kirk and Khan, but another part of the plot gets into Kirk's lost love, a love child of sorts and a secret weapon that Khan wishes to unleash upon the universe.  This is important, as it then spawns three more Trek films!<br /><br />Kirstie Alley (Cheers) is competently playing a Vulcan in this one, and is somewhat coy, but I was hoping for some kinda love mix-up with Kirk.  Oh well, can't have everything.  This film was her film debut.  A lot slimmer here, too.<br /><br />Nicholas Meyer directed this exciting piece of Star Trek canon.  Highly recommended especially if you like intrigue and space battles!
B002DKGWSE|1.0|Don't walk. Don't run. Don't even bother to go to your video rental store to get this one. The worst remake of all time was of \\"Psycho\\" ... the second worst is this one. If you must see this film rent or buy the original. Though this remake desperately tries  to be unique in its own right, as much as remakes go it's pathetic. The only shocking scene, not for the squeamish,  is when the father straightens one of the thugs nose. And that's not saying much.
6300214400|3.0|Star Trek III: The Search for Spock is a jumping off point for the series like a giant diving board!<br /><br />As we left our last episode, boys and girls, Khan, in a mad bid for Kirk's destruction, set off the Genesis device and in so doing created the Genesis planet out of the dust and debris of this nebula that Kirk was trapped in.  Just before that, Spock died.  Yes, he sure did, and no fan boy or girl of the time could believe it.  What the heck do they do now?<br /><br />Sarek, Spock's father returns with some news regarding Spock.  McCoy has his part to play as a \\"vessel\\" (not to spoil too much).  The film is not bad, with disobeying the Federation (what else is new) and seeing Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) as a Klingon!<br /><br />The Klingons want the secret of the Genesis device as it would make them a power to reckon with.  Kirk wants Spock.  Quite a problem.<br /><br />As in other odd-numbered ST films, this one is not a strong one, but does tie together the Wrath of Khan with the next in the series, The Voyage Home.  Directed by Leonard Nimoy and written and produced by Harve Bennett.
B0000C172Y|5.0|With all Neil's ventures into improved sound quality, things can get confusing. DVD Audio was Neil's earliest attempt in his 'Because Sound Matters' state of mind. He released 'Harvest' (out of print!) and 'Road Rock #1' in 5.1 surround, and the 4 other titles, 'On The Beach','Re-ac-tor', 'American Stars & Bars' and 'Hawks & Doves' on HDCD and and DVD-A. Please note that these were released in STEREO only. I own all except 'Hawks & Doves'. This one just arrived yesterday.<br /><br />Back to this DVD-A disc. I was fortunate enough to buy a fairly priced Pioneer DV563A back in 2004 that plays DVD-A and SACD. Still works great and I finally got around to buying this disc. There are enough reviews on the music itself (I personally love anything with Crazy Horse grunge), so about the SOUND. Only warm clean analog vinyl can sound better. I haven't had the chance to listen to blu-ray yet, but DVD-Audio for its time was as close to analog as it got. Somehow warmer sounding than SACD to my ears. It still sounds great with Neil's and Sampedro's guitars jumping out of my old school Advent floor speakers. When prices drop, I'll jump on the blu-ray bandwagon. If you're still interested in hearing DVD-Audio and have the right player and overall set-up, get this and his other DVD-A discs while they're still in print. As I mentioned, 'Harvest' on DVD-A is OOP and some sellers are listing ridiculous prices up to $200. How's that for a 'sound' investment...excuse the pun.<br /><br />FYI. Now he's just re-released 4 remastered titles at 24 bit 176KHZ as 'NYAORS' (Neil Young Archive Official Release Series) in conjunction with his Archives, Vol. 1. (mp3,HDCD, DVD, and Blu-ray). These include his first eponymous disc through Harvest. I just bought 'After the Gold Rush' and it is a noticeable upgrade from the original thin-sounding release. All in all, it's a good time to be an audiophile Neil Young fan or just a plain old fan.<br /><br />Enjoy your Neil as he intended his music to be heard....because sound truly does matter.truly does matter.
6301543408|2.0|Shatner co-wrote the story and directed Star Trek V, which changes a lot of what we fans know of Trek and is very derivative of earlier episodes without the humor and grace of what we expect.<br /><br />As in the Eden episode from the Sixties, an alien takes over the Enterprise and forces the crew to go to a planet that most say contains God.  OK, not bad, except the alien is Spock's brother!  Say what?  And he laughs out loud and belongs to a faction of Vulcans that have emotion.<br /><br />After this film, I don't think any writer has referred to this faction, nor to Spock having a brother, ever again.  And with good reason.  Just does not play as good Trek.<br /><br />Yeah, there are some interesting moments like Kirk climbing El Capitan and almost dying in a fall and teaching Spock campfire songs, but the overall film does not have the passion and the grace of the earlier films.<br /><br />The desert scenes seemed fake and the dancing/prancing Uhura was done over by another actress!  Nichelle Nichols is an accomplished singer/dancer, yet this was not to be.<br /><br />However, decent music by Jerry Goldsmith!  The weakest of the Original Trek films.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|Here's the short version: Take every stereotype of the Sixties and every stereotypical photographic/videographic image of the Sixties, then throw them into a blender with the Beatles catalog. What comes out? This tasteless mush of a movie.<br /><br />The longer version of a critique involves the fact that the creators of this so-called movie want to tug at our heart-strings with familiar images that are supposed to elicit sentimental feelings out of historical parts of our lives. Images of 'Nam are supposed to make us remember how horrible the war was. Images reminiscent of Kent State try to evoke the horrors of that tragedy. Referencing common themes of the Sixties does not make this a good movie about the Sixties. \\"Across the Universe\\" lacks any coherent narrative voice that makes us care about the characters in the story.<br /><br />And, as a side-tangent, Bono's cameo was comical in that he came across as a Robin Williams caricature of Bono.
630021463X|5.0|Star Trek IV takes a bit of the last film and a bit from the first one.  We have alien invasion, an environmental message about the destruction of whales as a species and Man as well.  We learn a lot more about Spock (as he becomes re-educated after his ordeal on the Genesis planet, last film) and time travel!<br /><br />Lots of fun lines in this one.  Only whales can communicate with a probe that sucks energy from anything in its vicinity and proceeds to evaporate the Earth's oceans.  The problem is that there are no more whales.  The Enterprise zips into the past (in a dubious fling around the sun -- as an aside, whenever some sci-fi films deal with time travel, they will go into the past by going the opposite direction of a rotating star or planet, ala Superman, but I digress), in an attempt to get whales from the past and bring them into their present.<br /><br />Trouble is, the Enterprise crew is on the lam, having stolen a Klingon ship (from an earlier film).  What to do?<br /><br />So they sail into 1986 San Francisco where the area is as alien as any galactic planet they've ever been to.  We hear Kirk with his double-damn on you in crossing a street, Spock giving a nerve pinch to a boom box Goth kid (the theater audience I watched the film with cheered at that) and trying to figure out what exact change means.<br /><br />San Francisco treats like landing in Golden Gate Park (\\"don't forget where we parked\\"), the fictional whale institute in Sausalito (and our enjoyable one and only visit with the biological scientist Catherine Hicks) and Chekov's discovery of the \\"nuclear wessels.\\"<br /><br />Directed by Leonard Nimoy, and story by Nimoy and Bennett.<br /><br />Has the charm and humor of the old TV series.  Highly recommended.
B001PLOK4U|5.0|Wonderful movie !  Strong performances by the entire cast.  This movie presages the Civil Rights movement and Barack Obama's election to the Presidency
B0029LHWHM|5.0|I think the essence of this book is very well captured in a quote Dawkins himself uses in the book:    \\"You should respect your fellows religion, but only in the sense, and to the extent, that you respect his theory that his wife is beatiful and his children smart.\\"    (Freely from memory. I have forgotten who said it, but it is credited in the book.)    In the book Dawkins uses all his knowledge and reasoning to scrutinize religion in every way possible. To someone like me, atheist (or rather, a pearlist - believer in Physical Evidence And Reasoned Logic), this book of course offers a goldmine of argument. But I also believe that any religious person, willing to scrutinize his och her own beliefs, should read this book. It poses some very important questions, regarding scientific and logical matters as well as philosophical matters.    Although the language of the book is not overly complex, Dawkins has made no effort to make it simple. The kind of logical arguments and reasoning he presents will probably make the book a heavy reading for some, but even so, I hope you will find it a page-turner just like I did.
B0029LHW4A|5.0|I fell in love with this band, because they were such a mixture of genres, rock, pop, funk.  They were something I considered unpredictable and in music, that is a rarity.  They've often been called the modern day Beatles.<br /><br />Track by Track quick feelings:<br /><br />This album starts off with the funk/rock \\"K.I.A\\"....funky bass, clear retro guitar and a big back beat, then comes \\"Beat on Repeat\\", clapping hands and vocals over a nice bass line and beat, this song isn't as rich as some of Jet's other it has a simple feel and comes in really short at 2:30.<br /><br />\\"She's a Genius\\" a very traditional Jet song, high octane fuel with a driving chorus and beat.  I am pretty sure this will become a single, it has it written all over it.  I dig it, feels like the Jet I remember from their two previous albums, which were \\"Genius\\".<br /><br />\\"Black Hearts\\":, That bright clear guitar is through this entire album and it shows up in this song as a driving force.  Pre-chorus is warm and the \\"clapping hands\\" are that retro part of Jet that I dig.<br /><br />\\"Seventeen\\" is a song I would describe as Jet on parade, piano line opens and then into a warm pre-chorus, this is a bright song.<br /><br />\\"La di Da\\" Faster tempo with a rambling type vocal.  My least favorite, but this could change, as you know a new album often times morphs over several months and that could change!<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Hollywood\\" I think this is more traditional Jet, the organ in the pre-chorus being the only instrument with the vocal, is sort of the retro feel that they have that makes them special.  This song has a solid feel to it, a bit of a slower tempo.<br /><br />\\"Walk\\" Slow, piano, Jets emotional train ride for this album.  It doesn't compare in my opinion to songs like Kings Horses and Shine On, but it's good.<br /><br />\\"Times Like This\\"  I liked the lyrics on this one, but it felt extremely similar to every other song on this album, I don't think there is as clear a picture from song to song as on their previous albums.<br /><br />\\"Let Me Out\\"  This had an 80's feel to it for me, as if it were written for a John Hughes film (R.I.P.) and all those tunes were epic in their own, lyrically.  Strong song.<br /><br />\\"Start the Show\\"  Jet goes ACDC.  Rock.<br /><br />\\"She Holds a Grudge\\"  This is the Jet I remember.<br /><br />OVERALL:  This is not Jet's strongest album in my estimation.  Musically it is similar from song to song as opposed to each song being a separate portrait as their previous albums, this album feels like more of a album piece, all linked.  Which can be a good thing for some and a bad thing for others.  I give it 5 stars because it is good, even though I prefer their first two records to this latest effort.  They are unique enough in music to be someone who deserves recognition.  If you are thinking about checking them out, I beg you to buy their first two albums first.<br /><br />Great band.0's feel to it for me, as if it were written for a John Hughes film (R.I.P.) and all those tunes were epic in their own, lyrically.

B00004Y6NW|2.0|I usually look forward to and love buying re-mastered CDs as the technology of today is so much better than when CDs were first released in the 80s.  I never owned this on CD until now but must say that there is something very wrong in the sound of this remastered version. The mid-range is skewed, burying the vocals, almost like you are listening to it through glass.  Very surprising for a such a great Dire Straits recording.
0679805273|5.0|What can you say--It's Dr. Suess.  I purchased this for the guest register for our daughter's graduation.
B000IJ79V6|5.0|Like the films that followed the original Star Wars, this is one of those rare moments that the sequel is just as good (or better) than the first. Whereas Superman I, there was little action but a lot of story, this had more action and a lot of story. Reeve again is superb as the Man of Steel, but this time he's faced with a dilemma of choosing between continuing as his superhero persona or giving it up for Lois. And after choosing a mortal life, he feels regret after seeing General Zod take over. Kidder is also excellent as Lane, also showing character depth. My favorite scene with the two is near the end, where she's telling him about how messed up her life is/will be now that she knows. Hackman is more of the co-villain and manipulates Zod and his cohorts into fighting Superman then tracking him down by coaxing the General's ego. The actors who play the villains (Terence Stamp, Sarah Douglas and Jack O'Halloran) do it with menace and a very dry sense of humor. The effects are better than ever, especially during the fight in Metropolis and Ken Thorne does an admirable job of doing Williams' magnificent themes. What I don't like about this movie is Richard Lester. He inserts too many sight gags than are necessary for a superhero film (especially when the villains use their superbreath). And the flying scenes with Superman just feel flat (his cape moves more in the Fortress of Solitude than when he's flying at top speed to France). But if I had to pick which version of this film I prefer, it's this one. Not that Donner's version was bad. My main problem is the ending. Donner's is just a copout and the events that follow or that have preceded don't make sense. For instance, after spinning the earth backwards (again), the encounter with the bully is irrelevant (despite the fact that Superman remembers) and the destruction of the Fortress is redundant. The ending in this version makes more sense and the ending makes me feel very patriotic. Amazing that a movie about a fictional character can do that when our present government, especially the man in charge, can't. He just can't stir the feeling in me that I get when I see Superman fly the top of the White House back to the President.<br /><br />UPDATE (4 YEARS LATER) In preparation for Man of Steel (which I'll eventually review) I re-watched Superman 1 and both versions of 2. I've got to admit I still enjoy the Lester version. Granted I still despise the sight gags in the super breath sequence but it just is better in my opinion. There are things in the Donner version I liked, such as the scene in the hotel when Lois deduces Superman's identity, the fight in Metropolis and the removal of a lot of Lester's humor. Also the first missile that Superman diverts into space and releasing the villains instead of the hydrogen bomb I liked as that links both films better. The Brando scenes I really didn't enjoy and they dragged the pace of the film by having him repeat a lot of the same dialog (such as the first film scenes in the beginning with him talking about the villains and then repeating the same thing in the Fortress of Solitude). The scenes with Susannah York were better since it builds a more emotional connection by understanding that Clark would want to fall in love. The green crystal deus ex machine is also set up better in Lester's version by having Superman show and explain it to Lois, who then drops it when she and Superman eat dinner and he later finds it when he returns. The Donner version just has it show up out of nowhere. Right before the fight starts, I prefer the line \\"Would you care to step outside?\\" over \\"Haven't you ever heard of freedom of the press?\\". I like how Ken Thorne builds the theme music when Superman begins to crush Zod's hand. It's an awesome moment (I'd like to think audiences cheered back in 80/81 when this happened) versus reusing John Williams' work from the first film. The ending is still pointless, making the hour and forty minutes you just spentwatching this entirely pointless. I don't care if it was the original ending that Donner had in mind, I don't care if he had continued on as director that he would've changed it, it doesn't change the fact that the entire movie is now pointless. Leaving the deleted scene of the Arctic police arresting Zod and the others out of the equation, in the Lester version, the villains are dead. In the Donner version, they still live due to time being reversed. Yes they are still imprisoned but what's to stop some anomaly in space from setting them free and they take over other planets, build an empire and head to Earth. If Superman remembers everything after he's reversed time, who's to say the villains don't? Granted the super-kiss of forgetfulness doesn't make any sense either but it doesn't render the whole film pointless. Overall, the Lester version gets 5 stars, Donner's 4.watching this entirely pointless.

B0000TB014|4.0|I had already owned History on Film Volumes 1 and 2 when I purchased this DVD because I had become slightly tired of sitting through some of the longer \\"short films.\\" This was great because it has all the best videos, but in their shortened format, except for Thriller which is presented in its entirety. Although, I wish it had included the shortened version of Thriller instead. But it's still great for sitting down and watching with family and friends.    My ONLY issue with this DVD is that unlike the History DVDs, this DVD does not include any subtitles. I would have enjoyed seeing the words appear across the screen while the video played so I could sing along.
0307588335|3.0|I am fascinated with the workings of Wall St.  Stories of these bright young people who make 10 to 20 times my salary (I'm a project manager in the manufacturing sector) by making shrewd moves or inventing devices like CDOs is very interesting to me.  It didn't take much to keep my interest on this topic.  Lehman's failure is a classic story of how the mighty fall.  This book kept my interest most of the time but I wish that the authors had worked a little harder.    This book is nothing more than one man's memoir.  There are no references and I have to assume that they did very little or no research.  This along with the fact that MacDonald was not an insider on the 31st floor, he could only speculate an quote rumor on what Fuld was actually doing and thinking during his tenure there.  MacDonald's politics are very clear.  Clinton is cited as the President who haplessly created this mess by signing the repeal of the Glass-Steagle act but it was not noted where the Bush administration either did not act when the signs of an over-heating economy were clear or the acts they did to help fan the flames for increased home ownership in the US.      MacDonald has not lived the kind of life where I would consider reading his biography, but I endured his self-serving bio for nearly the first third of this book.  I recommend skipping that part of the book.  This book was not particularly well-written but the story line was interesting enough for me that it kept me engaged.    My recommendation is that if you are a Wall St outsider who is interested in reading stories about life on the inside...and you can't wait for books that will most certainly follow on the collapse of Lehman...buy it.  If you want a well-balanced, well-research and well-written book on this subject, just wait a few months, I'm sure that book is being written.    In a sense, I regard this book as being part fact and part fiction and I can't tell which is which.

0525421033|5.0|Wow. This book was powerful, to say the least. It is a story filled with sadness and heartbreak, and one only hope. A incredibly beautiful story that makes the reader collide in a cloud of emotions. I kept imagining it was me, how would I react? So hard to tell.    The writing and the plot were formidable. I loved the way she tells the story on a magical wave. The characters were so real, the book to me felt almost non-fiction. The feelings that play inside you while you read this wonderful story; they are the best part. Knowing everything will change with one decision you make. Powerful.    The cover, even though it's not one that I like, I can't think of any good cover for this. Had it been my book I would've left it cover-less. So of course, I think the current cover is well enough fitting. It is a story about every kind of love and most of all, every kind of loss. But more than anything it lifts music to another level. The main character in the story is the magic of music. If you can relate to that this book is for you.
B002E01LL6|1.0|Dito Montiel ('A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints') has a sense of the raw flavor of the streets of New York and he is apparently respected enough to have actors of the quality of Terrence Howard and Luis Guzm&aacute;n sign on to his projects. His latest release on DVD is FIGHTING (co-written with Robert Munic), a rather tepid film trying hard to be a piece of verismo.  The story is so overused that it no longer can maintain an audience's interest: the outcome of the film is guessed within the first few minutes.  Briefly, Shawn MacArthur (model and type cast actor Channing Tatum)  works the streets of New York around Radio Music Hall, selling ripoff copies of books and gadgets to tourists.  He is involved in a fight, observed by the quiet scam artist Harvey Boarden (a wasted role for Terrence Howard) and by a young girl Zulay (Zulay Henao), and while Shawn's eye fixes on Zulay, Harvey's eye is on Shawn's possibilities as a 'fight for money' partner.  Shawn moves in with Harvey, develops a relationship with Zulay, and proceeds to win fights for money, until he is asked to fix a fight - a bit of conscience blurring created by a clash with his own father and the proposed opponent Evan Hailey (Brian White) - and ends his 'career' in a way we can all imagine.<br /><br />One would suppose we should care about the relationship between Shawn and Harvey and how mutually saprophytic it becomes, but the script gets in the way of having us care about anyone in the film - with the possible exception of Zulay's abuela (Altagracia Guzm&aacute;n), a little cameo that almost make the rest of the film worth watching. This is one of those movies that promises a lot but simply cannot deliver more than a dreary rehash of street fight movies.  Grady Harp, August 09
015206396X|5.0|How can I even begin to review this book? How could I get you to trust me and read it, for it is one of the best book I've ever read? I can think of only one way: Must Read. I speak as I read. I'm happy. I'm sad. I'm scared. I'm relieved. I'm shocked. I'm waiting. Yes, all this while reading. Fiction, action, romance, friendship, fantasy, love, coping, dealing, Kings, Queens, evil, kindness, villain, killing... What else can you ask for in a book?    The writing was excellent, astonishing. The plot was full of magic and emotions. The characters, oh, the characters; they were unforgettable and brilliant. I can not even pick a character a loved the most. They all were above marvelous. I love Po and Katsa obviously, but the rest were equally amazing. I do love Po! Did I say that already?    I could not have imagined a better cover either, I loved the color, the effects and the eyes! The beginning, the ending and the story were all amazing. How she came up with all this, I have no idea. Needless to say, that whatever your reading preferences are, you have to read this book. I highly recommend it.

You're going to love it.
B000M341QE|4.0|Martin Scorsese may be the most beloved director for American cinephiles.  From his early triumphs to his later masterworks to his repeated Oscar snubs, Scorsese was always on the short list of Great American Directors.  Who hadn't heard some film nut wax poetic over Scorsese's tale of listening to the gangsters talking on the streets near his childhood home, \\"so he knows how these guys talk!\\"  Who hadn't been reminded of his encyclopedic knowledge of American music and his mastery of soundtracks?  Who hadn't heard of the legendary violence in his movies?    \\"The Departed\\" was a seeming odd choice for Scorsese - it's a direct remake of the Asian blockbuster, \\"Infernal Affairs.\\"  Indeed, if you have seen \\"IA,\\" as I have, you really have to question all the accolades that Scorsese and Team earned with this movie - including Scorsese's Oscar for Best Picture.  If there has been a greater example of a \\"make up\\" award, I can't think of one.      The plot of \\"IA,\\" adopted by \\"The Departed,\\" is fantastic - a criminal organization has a mole buried deep in the metro police, and the police bury a mole deep in the criminal organization.  They are charged with finding each other while coping with this soul-crushing burden.  Both cops and criminals play for keeps - the body count is as high as the tension.  And cellular phones feature prominently in both films.    Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon play the respective moles.  DiCaprio works for the police and gets close to mob boss Frank Costello, played with brio but not much originality by Jack Nicholson.  (Jack's played this role before, although his Boston accent is something new.)  Damon gets close to the top of the police food chain, populated with such talented actors as Mark Wahlberg, Alec Baldwin, and Martin Sheen.  There's plenty of testosterone to go 'round, especially when Damon and DiCaprio fall for the same police shrink.    This is not a bad movie, and if you haven't seen \\"IA\\" before, you might think it's great.  However, there's something about watching a copy - even one as stylish and brutal as \\"The Departed\\" - that saps the experience.
0307266303|5.0|I love this book.  If you want to be motivated for running or if you're just looking for a great book then you will adore this as much as I do.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|It has a very nice variety of songs and tempos, despite its \\"breaking up\\" theme. I loved about 10/12 of them. \\"I Don't Believe You\\" and \\"Bad Influence\\" are my favorites by far. Overall, a great cd that is worth the purchase.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|It's worth every penny. It has Michael from his early career til his last album Invincible. It even contains demo versions of songs, and the DVD is actually him in concert. The concert shows him in all his glory. If you buy any Michael Jackson merchandise this would be one of the top ones to get.
B000A2RRF4|2.0|I was greatly disappointed in this DVD. There were many things that bothered me about this DVD, one: The sound is terrible!! It is quite difficult to understand what he is saying even when singing. I dont know why they dont take the sound direct from the mikes and not from the speaker system. Second, film quality is poor to fair at best. From what I am hearing this common with all his concert DVD's and this is a tragety if its so, the King of POP in this day and age has no filmography worthy of his status!!! Third and most annoying, whoever directed/edited this DVD stood fast to the 5 second rule, no scene shall last more than 5 seconds. This can actually get nauseating with all these quick cuts and gratuitous shots of the audience to ad nauseum!!! Who cares, when he is on stage I want to see this guy Move and they actually cut away from some intricate dance sequences of Michael and cast to showing fainting screaming fans. Ridiculous.<br />  This is no slight against the talent of Michael as even with all these flaws this DVD shows a HARD working talent giving his fans all he has. This DVD is a poor legacy for a King, especially one who now has left us so untimely.
B001KYJA6K|5.0|'Teatro d'Amore should be in the running for \\"Classical Recording of the Year\\"  What fun it must have been for the performers to create this splendid recording.  I have bought three copies for friends, and continue to hear new details and nuances with each listening.  Christina Pluhar uses great musicians and singers on this CD, and the ensemble playing is incredible.  There is something for everyone here, but \\"Lamento della Ninfa\\" and \\"Zefiro torna\\" are incredibly beautiful, and will melt your heart.  Its amazing how modern this music sounds, the \\"walking bass\\" line of Chiome d'oro, and Ohimie ch'io cado are an interesting side note, but in the end its Claudio Monteverdi who is truly a \\"man for all seasons\\"     Ray Parton
B001AQR39O|5.0|Yesterday I watched all 12 episodes within a period of 11 hours.  The show is truly addictive.  Once you see one you want to see the next episode to see how things turn out.    I very highly recommend it as long as you're not offended by endless sex, drugs, drinking, smoking and dirty words.  Lucky for me, this doesn't offend me.    Does seem rather unrealistic though since I can't seriously imagine anybody in the real world having as much sex as these characters do, but it does live up to its name of CaliFORNICATION.    I rented this DVD because I loved the first season and the second fully lived up to expectations.  Let's hope #3 is just as good.
B001FB55I0|3.0|I'v enjoyed all 4 films.  The only thing I notice missing from Salavation was the pacing was off.  The first 3 films(yes, even the 3rd) kept up that relentless, stalking, edge of your seat type pacing that the 4th film just lacked.    In terms of quality of production, acting, effects, it's top notch. It just doesn't flow as well as the earlier films.     So in my opinion it would come in 4th behind the previous films. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it or thought it was bad.......just not quite the experience for me as the earlier films.  Will still buy it though when it comes out on Blu-Ray    I'm looking forward to the next film.  Bring it on!
0786852550|5.0|Wow. where to start. I picked up this book at a local store for a few dollars. When I started reading it wow, captured my attention immediately. I soon realized this was no children's book. Even though the age group is 9-12, it is certainly higher. I had to pull out my mini dictionary to keep up with the story. Please do look up any words you do not understand, it adds much meaning to the part you are reading from.   Stroud uses a 1st person narrative complied with a 3rd person point of view. It has been written beautifully and flows without interruptions. This story invites you in and happily talks to the reader. This book is not an ordinary fantasy. It takes the reader and shows you a different side of youe same old stories you hear. It cleverly adds some history and social/political issues. Please get this book for yourself. This is not a dissapointment.  *The ending was fantastic. It is not needed to get the 2nd book, but why would you not?
0385342020|5.0|Sophie Kinsella has a knack for creating heroines which may seem flaky & silly at the onset of the stor, but throughout the book they build up their confidence and transform their own lives & often the lives of the people around them.<br /><br />The premise of the book is rather farfetched: Lara Lington is being haunted by the ghost of her great aunt Sadie who is looking for a lost necklace, and while Sadie seems a little bothersome at first (OK, well - a lot), very soon Lara realizes that with Sadie by her side she can change her life to be what she wants it to be, and snub the rich & snobby side of her family. But since this is Kineslla's usual light hearted style - anyone looking for a serious book would probably not pick up 'Twenties Girl' in the first place. On the other hand, it is clear that Kinsella has done massive research into the 1920's: the clithng styles, hair styles & slang are the 'real thing', not a modern interpertation of them.
B002I9Z8DK|5.0|This edition of TUC is the first and ONLY way to obtain the original theatrical version of the film. The theatrical version is significantly different (and better) in it's storytelling than the extended video version available up until now. Not even the so-called \\"special edition\\" released some years back had the original version on it! This edition is a must for any fan of the original series.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|It was excellent except for two of the cd's had something wrong with them as they stopped in the middle of the episode and picked back up after a 10 second pause.  Evidently there was a defect in my shipment and was disappointed since this was my first time ordering from amazon.
0140557741|5.0|Excellent tool for beginning the new school year with elementary teachers.  I used this book in a staff meeting to convey how we must look deeply at a child before we draw conclusions about them with no basis for foundation.  We looked at it over and over again.  This is a forever book.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|i loved this book from page one until the very end and highly recommend it whether you are a runner or not because i am not much of one and it has inspired me. first book i purchased on my kindle
0553378384|1.0|I hate to say I did not particularly like this book. It did not resonate within me and it was on a negative note throughout...I felt I was being punished....
B0000TB014|1.0|I expected to get a qaulity video product - these are music vidoes! The image is so grainy that I would be embarrassed to play the DVD to anyone. The tracking where the lip movement and actul verbal track are so far off that it makes this a DVD I wish I had never ordered. I am going tp try and get it replaced, but I doubt there will be any success there. Second-rate product for \\"being new\\". Very dissapointed - don't waste your money or time.
B002E01LL6|3.0|I didn't go into the theater expecting much from this film.  Granted we've seen this kind of fair before but I'm a big fan of Tatum so I had to give it a chance.  I'm glad I did because I found myself enjoying the movie more than I thought I would.  The fights were brutal and very realistic.  Tatum can show he can take a punch, unlike Sean Faris in \\"Down\\" who looks like he's posing for a special issue of Cosmopolitan.  While I don't think this film will appeal to everyone I do recommend this if you're a fan of Tatum or Howard.
B001EO748M|4.0|Well, I knew old Henry VIII was a man in search of a lady fair who could give him a son, but... he certainly wasted no time on formalities like getting married first!  Actually he did marry, of course, several times and we all know what happened to most of his wives, but he was also out there sewing his wild oats, too.  Even the powerful Cardinal Woolsey- who wielded quite a bit of power behind the throne, held no ceremony on the sanctity of his priesthood- he found time for his share of daliences, too! The production is extremely well done, beautiful details in clothing and sets- fabulous and sumptuous, but don't watch it with the kids!
B00005JMUA|4.0|Uma Thurman shines in this wonderful sequel to the original Kill Bill.  Beatrice Kiddo (Thurman) only has three other people left on her list: Bud, Elle, and Bill.  While Beatrice never gets to fight Bud, she has a spectacular fight with Elle that is reminscent of her earlier confrontation with Vernita.  Not to spoil it for people who haven't seen it I will tell you that it will leave you gasping at the conclusion of their fight.  But the real star of this is David Carradine (RIP).  He is charismatic as the Snake Charmer Bill, leader of the Vipers.  He has such great chemistry with Thurman that it's a shame he had to leave us so tragically.  This is a must for any Tarantino fan.  The only downside is we'll have to wait for anymore Kill Bill films.
B00288KNJU|4.0|This movie was great. As fans of Nightmare Before Christmas we bought this movie even though myy wife and kids had already seen the movie in the theater. It was my first time seeing it and I liked it. One of the reasons we bought the Blu-ray disc/DVD combo was because we didn't have a Blu-ray disc player at the time but we knew we were going to. We ended up buying the BD player before the movie arrived so we were able to enjoy the movie in HD. It's good to have both formats if you don't have a BD player but expect to get one later.
B00005JMEW|4.0|WOW!!  That's all I can say when I first saw this film by Quentin Tarantino.  Uma Thurman is superb as the left-for-dead bride who comes back four years after being left in a coma to wreck vengeance on the cowards who tried to do her in.  David Carradine plays Bill, the clandestine leader of the Vipers, who seems to direct everyone's motives from the shadows.  This is definately Tarantino at his best and I highly recommend it.  It's not a film franchise for everyone; if anyone saw the interview he had with KRON's Jan Wahl a few years ago it just goes to prove that Tarantino makes films that he wants for his fans, not for those who love musical theater (not that there's anything wrong with that genre either).
0823016714|5.0|I'd most definitely recommend this to anyone who draws characters or people, it's an extremely useful book.

I am so grateful to the author for writing the great book and let us know about running shoes myths. I was so fascinated to read about some of the amazing ultra marathoners in America and around the world.I recommend this book to all the runners and non-runners. Kudos to Christopher McDougall for a great book.
B001JNNDBA|5.0|I LOVE this movie!!! Definitely in my top 10 of all time. It is too bad Richard Kelly's movies after this one were so horrible, but at least he had one masterpiece.
0743290127|5.0|I honestly bought this book because I didn't find anything better at the time.   Have to say I thought I would have been disappointed by it but I really liked it.  I bought it at the airport, in a foreign language (and it cost me double the price!!) - but after all it was kind of worth it.
B0021L8US0|5.0|For a movie that was slated as 'Plan B' (after Peter Jackson's original Halo project was shelved indefinitely), this movie, in my opinion, certainly deserves to be placed in the 'A List' category.  It's a rare thing, especially with the current trend to go mega-budget for special effects, shallow plots and 'gosh-wow' explosions on screen in science fiction, to see a diamond peek out through the pile of charcoal.  This is one such movie.  It has something to say and says it in no uncertain terms.  What it does not do is say it in a preachy way.  You see it as it is and it's left up to you to decide how to take that message.<br /><br />You can't really call D9 a sleeper hit, because it was advertised well enough and they smartly put Peter Jackson's name on it as part of the title to prick people's ears up when they saw the previews, but it conveys the same feel as an indie movie with a controversial theme.  Now, the theme in this movie is not so much controversial anymore, in that the points it discusses are well-known and have been documented for years, BUT,<br /><br />it still hits a nerve for those with the sensitivity to see it, and does it with a new twist.<br /><br />For those people who are in it only for a little bit of escapist fun, who think action is what a movie is all about, no, you're NOT going to 'get' District 9 and I would advise you to pass it by on the way to the alcove showing Transformers 2.  For those of you who are so de-sensitized to the evils of the world that you're bored to death when watching the national news, I would also suggest not spending your hard-earned cash to watch this movie.<br /><br />For those who can (or want to) look at what's left unsaid in a story, I would HIGHLY recommend seeing District 9 at least once, even if you're not that into science fiction.<br /><br />STORY-5 Stars<br />The story in D9 takes place in an area of the world known for it's historic inhumanity to man; Johannesburg, South Africa, and was filmed in a gritty documentarial style by director Neill Blomkamp, who grew up there and saw the cruelty firsthand and that in itself lends a dark authenticity to the project.<br /><br />About twenty years prior, a spaceship of huge size descended to hover over the city of Jo'burg amid worldwide attention.  To Earth's surprise, all that happened afterward was a small shuttle that detached from its underside to land and bury itself in the ground.<br /><br />And that was it.<br /><br />Finally the world got tired of waiting.  Security forces under the aegis of the MNU drilled a hole to the ship's interior to find a host of millions of malnourished, nearly dead extraterrestrial creatures.  These were promptly ferried down to the surface, nursed back to health and cordoned off into an area outside the city dubbed District 9.<br /><br />There were no shattering revelations from these beings.  There were no miracle cures for disease, no blueprints for clean unlimited power sources, or higher-order philosophical treatises on how we could improve our lives here on Earth.<br /><br />There WERE weapons that they'd brought with them, but their usage was dependent on having the DNA coding possessed by these visitors, and these VISITORS showed no interest whatsoever in sharing the secret with us, so that was of absolutely no help.<br /><br />These others, aside from their green exoskeletal covering and antennae, addiction to cat food, and rasping, croaking language, were in effect, JUST LIKE US.  They showed no ambition to better themselves, no desire to get their ship back in working order, nothing but simply surviving from day to day.  Just normal everyday living beings.  They were eventually given the derogatory label of 'prawn' and quietly relegated to becoming the new underclass of society, given only menial jobs for survival, the District 9 slum to live in, and no hope that things were ever going to get better.<br /><br />The population of Johannesburg now becomes fed up with the prawn's proximity to the city and elects to forcibly evict them to the more concentration camp-style 'District 10'.  If the prawns are not going to help us out, they need to go away.  MNU's head of security appoints his son in law, Wikus Van De Merwe, to head up the relocation.  Happy sap that he is, he eagerly complies (even though he is clearly in over his head) and begins his trek through D9, smiling for the news cameras and displaying all of the illegal 'contraband' that turns up on a day-to-day basis in the encampment, from radios to computers to incubating eggs that he promptly orders destroyed.<br /><br />In investigating one shack, he discovers a vial full of a strange dark liquid.  The seal breaks, spraying him in the face...<br /><br />...And then the adventure begins.<br /><br />VISUALS-5 Stars<br />For a supposed budget of just 30 million dollars (small potatoes for the U.S. but likely considered a HUGE budget in South Africa), the effects are some of the best I've seen and they're integrated with masterful skill into the real-world scenes.  The violence is graphic, but it's not gratuitous.  As a former Marine, I know what happens to a body when struck by a bullet, and the action sequences realistically portray the consequences of what occurs when someone is shot.  They're not pretty, nor should they be.  People should be made to understand in no uncertain terms what happens when you forcibly end a life.<br /><br />SOUND-5 Stars<br />The musical score ain't rock and roll, but there are beautiful percussive riffs mixed in with ethnic vocals and these work to bring home the feel of the warm laid-back desolation of the continent of Africa.  I plan on buying the soundtrack for when I run my tabletop sci-fi gaming sessions.<br /><br />In a nod to the regional dialects, the conversations are at times hard to understand, but there are subtitles placed at strategic locations throughout the movie for those unused to the non-human and the thick english accents.<br /><br />OVERALL-5 Stars<br />The manner in which this film is laid out PERFECTLY conveys what happens when someone is pushed to reexamine all of their preconceived notions of life and then finds those notions lacking.<br /><br />On the sci-fi side, it also asks the question:  If there is actually the possibility of life out there (like I truly believe there is) and our neighbors decide to come and visit, are our needs better served by extending our hand in friendship, or in force?...<br /><br />...ESPECIALLY if they're technologically more advanced than we are?<br /><br />Peace out.rict 10'.

In a nod to the regional dialects, the conversations are at times hard to understand, but there are subtitles placed at strategic locations throughout the movie for those unused to the non-human and the thick english accents.    OVERALL-5 Stars  The manner in which this film is laid out PERFECTLY conveys what happens when someone is pushed to reexamine all of their preconceived notions of life and then finds those notions lacking.    On the sci-fi side, it also asks the question:  If there is actually the possibility of life out there (like I truly believe there is) and our neighbors decide to come and visit, are our needs better served by extending our hand in friendship, or in force?...    ...ESPECIALLY if they're technologically more advanced than we are?    Peace out.
B002EWD08Q|3.0|I agree with the Doors comparison in an earlier review, and I was somewhat seduced by the overall richness of the sound on this record. However, there's not a memorable song on this CD and you can't cover weak songs with production, no matter how hard you try. I remember a couple of years ago when The Futureheads made their masterpiece to the outrage of fans that wanted them to forever sound like earlier XTC, so I don't want to discourage these talented lads from exploring new territory. I like the fact that the Monkeys have embraced what was always their disposition, that of disillusionment and darkness, but this disc could use some better songs.
B000JLQSW4|5.0|As well as reviewing an album which is brilliant even by the lofty standards of the Alan Parsons Project, I'm going to point out that there exists a version of this CD which surpasses even the remastered version generally available in the UK and the US. More on this later............     On a briefly personal note, I discovered APP in 1982 when I bought 'Pyramid' - and was so staggered that I went straight back out and bought the five other albums available at that time. In my amazement at this discovery, I tended to under-rate 'I Robot'. Now - and I'm not alone in this amongst Project fans in saying this - I rather think it's their best effort, and it's certainly the Project album that I find myself playing most often.     The Project seemed then, and remains to this day, the absolute zenith where progressive rock is concerned. In the late 1970s, as disco and then punk began to take over the music scene, the Project carried on regardless - with this kind of talent, you can afford to ignore trends in the broader spectrum.     As anyone reading this probably knows, the Project was the first \\"producer's band\\" - the main man, Alan Parsons, didn't even appear on the albums in the early days. Parsons, whose studio credits included 'Abbey Road', 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Year of the Cat', 'Modern Times'.......(the list goes on)........teamed up with the multi-talented Eric Woolfson to produce a supposedly one-off concept album ('Tales of Mystery and Imagination') using the very best session artists available. In fact, the title wasn't meant to be the name of the band - it was the record company's shorthand for the first project (and, to be strictly fair, it should really have been called 'The Parsons-Woolfson Project').     The name stuck, the Project moved to a new label (Arista) and a follow-up album was planned - 'I Robot'. Parsons and Woolfson were inspired by the book 'I, Robot', but that title couldn't be used because the Asimov classic was contracted. No matter - drop the comma, broaden the subject to a general look at the possibility that robots could one day dominate mankind, and press ahead. (Given recent reported experiments by the military, the idea that robots could take over seems chillingly less implausible now than it did back in 1977).     As was to become the Project's pattern thereafter, the album kicks off with the instrumental title track, a superb if gradual opener. Then we move into rock mode with 'I wouldn't want to be like you', with new discovery (and future Project stalwart) Lenny Zakatek on vocals. The mellower (but still forceful) 'Some other time' is followed by 'Breakdown', to which Allan Clarke (of the Hollies) lends his vocal talents.     After the beautiful and wistful 'Don't let it show', we're on to one of the real highlights of an all-highlights album - 'The voice', sung by the incomparable Steve Harley (whose Cockney Rebel was yet another Parsons' studio credit). The excellent instrumental 'Nucleus' gives way to the outstanding 'Day after day'. Next comes the haunting choral-instrumental 'Total Eclipse', and then another superb instrumental, the menacing 'Gensis Ch.1 V. 32'. And that's where this superb album ended............     ........until the reissue programme, that is, because the nicely-remastered CD provides five bonus tracks, including the lengthy 'The naked robot'. These tracks are a bonus in the truest sense of the word, not least because they illustrate the painstakingly meticulous way in which the albums were honed from initial inspiration through to crafted perfection. Throughout, the instrumentals are a match for the galaxy of vocal talent on display - it's almost invidious to single anyone out, but I must mention wonderfully talented guitarist Ian Bairnson.     I said, at the start, that the best could be even better, and here's how. After enjoying the conventional reissue, I discovered SHM, a recent Japanese technical development which uses advanced materials to produce even greater musical clarity yet is fully compatible with standard CD players. SHM albums - which usually come in exact replicas of the original album sleeve, which means gatefold in this instance - are seldom inexpensive, but if you want to savour 'I Robot' in even higher fidelity, the extra outlay is very worthwhile.     And that's it - a brilliant, even better for remastering, better still on SHM......
B001MRMRS8|5.0|Having seen many productions of La Traviata, I appreciated this one for the dedicated performances of its principals, and for the illumination given by the unusual staging of two scenes. The director used the aria De' miei bollenti spiriti not as a monologue for the tenor, but a chance to show the sense of love and joy between Alfredo and Violetta. I have always found the gypsy girls and bullfighters at Flora's party to be waste of time, but in this production they were used to further drive Alfredo to distraction, which contributed to, rather than distracting from, the story.

0307266303|5.0|I LOVED this book!  As a long-time jogger of 33+ years, I was absolutely mesmerized by the story line and by the non-fiction info presented in such clear, entertaining fashion. I finished my Kindle reading and immediately started reading it again!  I have never done that with any book!  I also ordered 4 copies to give to friends. (Sorry for all the exclamation marks, but I really do love this book.)     One note: be sure to hang on through the first 20% or so of the book. The stories of the Mexican tribe runners gets just a tiny bit slow, but the shift in story line to the Leadville race and the parts about the science of running, including evolutionary biology (!)--well, don't miss them. The whole book is extremely entertaining. We really are BORN TO RUN!    PS: You'll save the price of the book by not buying those overpriced running shoes.  See the author's explanation and research. Amazing

B0021L8UM6|4.0|I have to admit I was shock at the level of great acting in this film.  It is surprising that this film was not highly talked about.  This  showcases Robert Patterson's talent as a actor a heck alot more than Twilight.  I also agree that this movie would not appeal to tween fans of Twilight.  If this is the level of acting that Robert Patterson is capable of then I look forward to seeing the after Twilight films from him.
0689853491|4.0|Just bought this board book for my 25-month-old son.  He LOVES it!  There is a lot of repetition in it, but for us it's more fun than boring because my son catches on quickly so we can read it aloud together in certain parts.    The illustrations are lovely sketch / watercolor, and my son loves the onomatopaeic words used (splash-splosh, etc.) when the family goes *through* several different physical obstacles (tall grass, water, snowstorm, etc.).  (By the way, \\"through\\" is a very significant word in this story, you'll find.)    What I love most about this book is the bear.  I cracked up when I noticed that the bear, walking on his hind legs, was following the family back to their home, and there is an illustration that shows him politely opening the gate to walk through while the family scrambles to get away from him.  I think that for even the youngest book lover, this type of humor is not completely lost, and it makes the difference between a silly romp of a book and one that could possibly be a little frightening - I mean, after all, a family IS being chased by a big bear!    I enjoyed reading this book almost as much as my son did, and that's pretty important when you know you'll be having to read it to your child over and over... and OVER again.

B0011UJMK2|4.0|This story is very interesting as it follows the evolution of the main character, Leo.  He is in search of a serial killer in a land (and time) where no such thing is ever acknowledged by the government.  It is full of tragedy and sorrow as a love story develops.      Enjoy!
B002FOQY2M|5.0|If you're going to be in a band named Fun you'd better be amazing, or be prepared to be mocked for the rest of your life.  Fortunately, the \\"fun\\" filled, Aim and Ignite is undeniably the product of some serious talent.  I've honestly never heard anything quite like it.      The eclectic mix of influences that must have inspired this little masterpiece, seems so vast, it borders on overwhelming.   I'm not sure whether I've stumbled across one of the first examples of genius combined with a lifetime of internet access, or the perfect balance between medicated and unmedicated ADHD.  Whatever it is, from beginning to end, it's delightful.  And, it seems to get better each time I hear it.
B000C13Y2S|5.0|My husband works in the dark more than half the time. He has headlamps, tripod flashlights, LEDs, you name it.<br /><br />I bought this one because it's a miniature version of the large 3 LED heads he already has. It was supposed to be a joke, after all, how bright could this little thing be? Well, he loves it and carries it with him constantly.<br /><br />It's bright enough to point at a road sign from his truck, bright enough to sit on the dash and read a map, etc. Is it for use when a professional grade flashlight is called for? Probably not, but for $8.00, you can't beat it. And the tripod really works, too.<br /><br />I'm going to order more for stocking stuffers, as a previous reviewer did. I like it better than my keychain Mag.
0312370849|4.0|Although only a 4 star review, I do recommend this book and will likely pass it along to family & friends who I think will enjoy it. My problem with the book is purely that it seemed so foreign. I was disappointed in some of the main character's choices. Her choice of husband was a pure mystery to me. I can never understand the idea of living with a spouse knowing of unfaithfulness. Somehow it made the character less sympathetic to me. All of the information historical details were the most fascinating. I hesitate to call it enjoyable because the times were so very horrific. But I gained knowledge about a time in history that I had no understanding of before reading this book. I believe that all people interested in learning will find the book to have something of interest.
B00005MP58|2.0|I only watched a bit of this as it turned out NOT to have subtitles which my husband needs. In the few minutes I watched the color looked washed out and not at all like the usual exceptionally colorful Masterpiece Theater version which I previously enjoyed.  The Jane Austen story is, of course, excellent.
B001U0HBQ0|1.0|BB misses the point. It gives us nearly three hours of mainly clich&eacute;d encounters, told minute-by-minute with deadly slowness. The central premise is mostly in the background.<br /><br />Only in the last ten minutes do we see an attempt to show the sense of loss in the decline of the character. But this was so much better done in \\"Charley.\\"<br /><br />What a bore.
B00028HBKC|2.0|As a Catholic, I had high hopes for this movie. Before its release, the press notices had mentioned that The Passion would relive Christ's final hours with painstaking realism, unlike the \\"sanitized\\" movies that had gone before it. The quest for historical accuracy would go to such lengths as to have a fully Aramaic and Latin script (with subtitles)! With such uncompromised attention to detail, it seemed as if The Passion had the potential to become the greatest among the movies about Christ. However, when I saw this film in the theatre shortly after its release, it quickly became apparent that the film was the product of a disturbed and rather shallow mind. In the hands of a talented, intelligent director/producer, this could have been a masterpiace; in the hands of Mel Gibson, it has the same level of artistic subtlety as a cheesy Hollywood action movie. For the sake of brevity, I will list a few reasons why this movie fails:    * The portrayal of Jesus is wooden in the extreme, and He is portrayed as little more than a dull, lifeless punching bag. His luminous, devine nature ought to shine through His suffering and sacrifice. Based on this movie's portrayal of Jesus, few non-Christians who watch this film would understand why Christians believe in Him.    * The film relies on the unconvincing and cheesy use of computer graphics during several key parts of the movie: for example, the bridge scene (from which Jesus is thrown), the Satanic apparitions, and the Crucifixion (the raven and the earthquake sequences come to mind).     * The film promotes Jew hatred. For example, the movie portrays all of the Pharisees as bloodthirsty, violent, and treacherous without exception, even though there is historical evidence that some of the Pharisees sympathized with Jesus. More outrageously, the film inserts a completely ahistorical sub-plot about Pilate and his wife, and how they sympathize with Jesus. Lastly, The Passion fails to portray the Jewish background of Jesus and his disciples.    In summary, this is a film that might satisfy so-called Christians who also happen to have really bad taste. If you like Die Hard-type action movies, this might be a great movie for you. But those who seek an intelligent, artistically and spiritually satisfying film about Christ will need to look elsewhere. Among the movies about Christ, Bertolucci's TV miniseries \\"Jesus of Nazareth\\" remains the best, with an outstanding performance by Robert Powell. Among the broader genre of Christian movies, \\"The Passion of Joan of Arc\\" remains the greatest movie ever made, bar none. Every Christian should see this astonishing, harrowing portrayal of courage and sacrifice.
B001TOD92C|1.0|You can predict every plot device in the story coming at you like a ten-ton truck.<br /><br />I have little to add to what others who disliked this film have said.<br /><br />As an acting exercise it showed some remarkable work by Rourke and Tomei.<br /><br />As a movie it was a disastrous pile-up of clich&eacute;s. If I have to itemize them for anyone, they need to see a few more films.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Please people don't buy this movie. I'm not a picky movie guy but I did notice the difference between the regular scenes and the extended cut scenes. How could anyone at the movie studio say 'looks good to me.'?!?!?!<br />I was invited to watch it with a local newspaper reviewer who said he knew of the issue before hand and, with out telling me that there are issues, asked me after the movie how I felt. I told him I think his TV is messed up or the disk is bad. He then told me what was wrong and it all snapped together.<br />He saved me and many in St. Louis who read his review some money.

B000KGGIQO|3.0|Johnny Cash is practically a household name, and even if you aren't into fifties music you're bound to recognize some of his songs, like Ring of Fire and I Walk the Line. However, there's more to his story and this film does its best to tell it.<br /><br />Johnny's hardscrabble life in a relief community to his service in the Air Force and his failure as a salesman are all looked at. The film pulls no punches when it comes to his eventual drug abuse as he performed on the road and the way the pills he took eventually pulled apart his life. His love affair with fellow performer Carter is also highlighted and in fact is a recurring theme in the DVD.<br /><br />A good film but not my cup of tea. No doubt if you're more into music you'd like this much more.
B000P5FH3K|1.0|John Grisham has proven himself to be the literary lawyer.  His books open the courtrooms to the masses, and allow the underdog to rule the day.  With that said, not every Grisham novel is best told in the cinematic language.  From \\"The Firm\\" to \\"A Time to Kill\\" and now to \\"The Rainmaker\\" directors and studios have tried to bring the elaborately well written stories to the screen with the same panache and excitement that is in the binded world - and yet every time, they fail.  The films are entertaining, but after one viewing - the ability to view a repeat performance has lost momentum.  Recently, \\"The Rainmaker\\" came across my DVD player, and I was forced to endure a repetitive story, one-dimensional characters, and a predictable ending that left me gasping for some originality.  One must admit that Francis Ford Coppola does attempt to bring a level of authenticity to the screen, but it is the mediocre Matt Damon and the always odd Danny DeVito that force this film to flounder.  Also, condensing a 443-page book into just over two hours is difficult.  There is quite a bit lost within the translation, and \\"The Rainmaker\\" is no exception.  From the lacking cardboard-esque relationship between Damon and Claire Danes all the way to the less-than-exciting courtroom element, \\"The Rainmaker\\" struggles to hold on, and after 12 years, it just doesn't remain as pivotal as it once, perhaps, was.<br /><br />Re-watching this film for the first time in ten years, I wasn't expecting Oscar-caliber performances, nor was I walking in with great unrealistic hopes - which may be the reason it didn't further my desire to watch more Grisham adaptations.  All I wanted from this film was an enjoyable two hours, but even that was a struggle.  The beginning struggle with \\"The Rainmaker\\" comes from Coppola's choice of pacing.  There is quite a bit of down time with this film, where we (as audience members) are merely watching small, unimportant character development that led nowhere.  Damon cutting grass, hanging out in a hospital, asleep at his desk, or late for his most important case ever - are all within this film, but edited stronger - leaving these small unneeded bits out - would have tightened this story further.  Coppola feels as if he has more information than this film can process within the time allowed.  This hurts not only the film as a whole, but the individual parts (i.e. the characters, the tone, and the intended drama) as well.  Because the editing was loose, we are lost when Damon heads to help his questionable love interest Claire Danes.  We are lost as to the direction of Damon's relationship with \\"Bruiser\\".  We are lost as to the focus of DeVito's character, who represents himself as smarter than Coppola gives him credit for.  So, to add to the mix of disheveled actors this plot that fails because of the lack of editing and character development, we have a sloppy film that is liked by too many.<br /><br />Plot.  Aristotle said \\"plot matters\\", and it should be believed that those involved with \\"The Rainmaker\\" should have paid further attention to this decree.  \\"The Rainmaker\\" is a film about a newbie lawyer taking his first big case which is in essence the simplistic story of big business versus the little poverty of America.  It is a strong beginning, but we loose focus when we add other elements that are never fully explained.  Is Danes really in love with Damon who is portrayed as someone merely eager to help her, not fall in love?  How influential was \\"Bruiser\\" to Damon's upbringing as a lawyer?  Did anyone else believe that when Danny Glover was introduced as the sympathetic judge that this case was predetermined?  Wouldn't anyone notice DeVito wasn't a lawyer - as smart as the defense was?  Voight was slimy, but was it just his accent that made him that way?  Then, we have the utterly realistic, but completely misplaced ending that felt cheap instead of honest.  There was supposed to be emotion from the family who suffered theloss, but we are left with such little time dedicated to either side, that we just feel bored.  Not a tear was struck with the emotion pulled out at the end, and I think that is an indication of how poorly Coppola directed this film.<br /><br />Overall, \\"The Rainmaker\\" leaves you with further disappointment than originally thought.  A courtroom drama is always worth at least one slick move, at least one important cameo, and one highly emotional scene that leaves you with the impression of how good these lawyers and genre's can be.  \\"The Rainmaker\\" had none of these.  Scaling this film among those like \\"A Few Good Men\\" or even Grisham's \\"The Firm\\", it falls well below.  If you walk in with no expectations, than perhaps this film will uplift your spirits.  Alas, for me - there was just a lacking plot, a terrible edit, and wafer-esque characters that hurt the determined tone of this film.  It was an embarrassing outing for Coppola as a director, but also the courtroom drama genre.  There are better films that fit the bill out there, avoid this one.<br /><br />Grade: ** out of *****re left with such little time dedicated to either side, that we just feel bored.

B00011CZRE|2.0|I know why lots of people liked this film.  It has many upcoming stars, like Paltrow, and some established ones who are not too bad (Pitt and Freedman).  Then there are the biblical references and the planing of a chess-player style killer.  But beyond some frills, is there really anything all that original or interesting?  Unfortunately, with the exception of some vivid images and special effects, the answer is no.  Moreover, the film is lacking in an original spirit, somethings that sets it apart on a fundamental level.  I did not see it and frankly, I hped to find it.<br /><br />Not recommended.
0345495004|4.0|This book provided me with hours of pleasant reading.  I really gleaned an insite into the life of Frank Lloyd Wright.  He was a man before his time.  Also Mayma was quite brave to enter into the relationship; however, very much a self-centered person to leave her family.  She did not have the strength to \\"tough it out\\" for the sake of her family.  Nor did Frank.  He was a  B  A  D    B  O  Y - totally all for himself and his own pleasure.  I guess the world is full of people who only think of themselves?    I was not prepared for the ending - quite gruesome and sad.
B0021L8US0|2.0|I just got back from watching this film on the big screen. I went into it with reasonably high expectations, as most everyone I know told me it was great, and the professional critics tended to agree. But after having seen it, I must say I am very disappointed. It began strong, with a documentary style: talking-heads discussing the events about to unfold in the film. But at about a little less than half-way through the film, it takes a nose-dive into the never-ending annals of generic film history. Yes, it invariably transforms into just another action flic at this point. It tries very hard to be thought provoking, but its delivery is a confused and inconsistent mess. And I also fault the film for creating very mixed feelings about the protagonist. First he seems one way and we feel this way about him, and then he acts in another way, then another, then another, and so on. Now, in more capable hands, that could very well make for a complex and engaging character, but after wards one is left with a troubling mixed and confused feelings about him. In the end, this only serves to separate us from him, as it is so very clear that such character-changing isn't very realistic. I couldn't relate to him at all.     This film tries to be thought-provoking and emotionally engaging, but it fails at both. Nearing its end, it gets ever so painfully cliched, not helping its purpose whatsoever. All in all, it was a very ridiculous film. Great sci-fi immerses you in a fascinating world to which you can relate, regardless of how far-fetched the world may be. Ironically, this is one of the least far-fetched sci-fi movies I have seen, and maintains no connection to reality.    There's definitely more I can fault this film for, but it was a late-night viewing and I ought to go to bed. My point remains:    As far as I am concerned, a movie either becomes a classic or adds to the heap of films ranging from utter crap to mediocrity. This film is not a classic. 3 stars for the first 50 orso minutes, 1 for the rest. I hope Moon, the next supposed \\"great, faith-restoring sci-fi\\" film on my viewing list, is better than this. Tentacles are crossed.
0060920084|1.0|Let me start by saying that I love all things Bill Bryson. I have laughed until I've cried at ceretain parts of every book he has written, and regularly relisten to \\"A Short History\\" on audiobook. Anybody that can make that much science that interesting is next to godliness in my book.     However.    I got \\"Lost Continent\\" on audiobook to listen to while working on a project in my studio. I had only read a blurb about what it was about, and loving Bryson, I picked it up sight unseen. I only got about halfway through before I just gave up, came home, and immediately deleted the whole set from my iPod. I don't know if it is his age at the time of writing, or some superiority complex from living abroad or what, but this is HORRIBLE.     There is almost none of his characteristic wit. He is insulting, degrading, and flat out crude for large parts of this tale. As far as I can tell, he did nothing but complain about how terrible everywhere he went was. In listening to 4 hours worth of storytelling, I can safely say he only found about 25 minutes worth of good stuff to talk about.    Frankly I was shocked at how overtly negative the whole tone is through the story. It was just so unlike anything else I had read of his. At one point I even stopped to wonder if there just happened to be another author out there with the same name and I had grabbed someone else by accident. I stopped listening partly to prevent my opinion of him from dropping any lower - everything else of his has been so wonderful and I usually recommend him to all my friends!    On an audiobook sidenote, I did not care for the reader either. While he had a pleasant enough voice to listen to, he did not speak in the manner that Bryson does (when reading audio books at least) and really added to the overtly sarcastic and degrading tone of the story. Yikes.
0375413405|5.0|Remeber, this is a classic. To condemn it for being out of date or using too much butter and cream is like condemning the Bible for being inaccurate. Of course, it's out of date and we are more health conscious these days. We have mostly gotten away from complex meal preparation because our lives are complex and there just isn't the time and energy. But...this is a classic and should be appreciated as such. My 1966 version (5th edition) is stained and well loved. I always turn to Julia for her fabulous blue cheese quiche or coq au vin. When Fall and Winter arrive, and the weather keeps me inside, there's nothing like making a Julia meal to satisfy the soul. A little fat now and again is a very, very delicious thing.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this movie! It is one of my favorite Jane Austen movies. The early English culture with its social classes and etiquettes coupled with a bit of romance make for a very interesting and satisfying entertainment. The story revolves around Anne, one of 3 daughters to a \\"rich\\" widower. Anne is the quiet and caring daughter, always doing the right thing, while the other 2 each have their own little quirks. Mary is such an entertaining and funny character! Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds do an awesome acting job!
B002JM1VJG|4.0|Why wouldn't an artist that truly loves and respects her fans NOT include ALL the videos from her career?  I can understand not including \\"live\\" re-edits (Dress You Up, Gambler, etc) but leaving out MAJOR moments in your career is silly.  This set is only 4 tracks away from near perfection.  The Pet Shop Boys made the BEST DVD set I have ever seen back in 03 with PopArt. It included ALL videos up to that point, plus commentary on all (even at their own expense), three extra tracks, as well as a shuffle option.  All that on ONE disc. I sometimes feel like Madonna wants us to buy everything just so she can laugh at us while we flip flop between DVD's and CD's JUST to get ALL of her hits at once.  I have loved her for years but I just don't like the marketing anymore, it feels like she couldn't care less if she has fans. Maybe it's the marketing company, maybe not, either way it's annoying. Who knows, maybe we will be graced with easter eggs on this set and I will happily be made a fool of.
1579126278|5.0|This book, like any Agatha Christie novel, was fantastic! This is one of her books though that the ending of it will never have occured to you even once. I know a lot of her books are like that, but with most you can at least guess close to the mark maybe. This one, though, is just so surprising that, like i said before, the thought of it would have never once occured to you. It caught me completely off guard, I would have never guessed! So if you like a good mystery novel with one of those magnificent surprise endings, this book is completely for you. I recommend it 100%. It was the best Agatha Christie I have read so far, and I have read quite a lot. I'd say it's better than \\"And Then There Were None\\" and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\", and those were my favorites. What I'm trying to say, once again, through all this rambling, is that this truely is an amazing book. I recommend it to all Christie, and mystery, lovers 100%.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Universal Home Video was responsible for this horrible contribution to the much lauded, premium \\"Sapphire Series\\" for Paramount's Blu-ray division.  According to Bill Hunt at The Digital Bits, they more than likely used an HD master from way back in 2000 for all theatrical footage and a newer HD transfer from 2005 for the extended scenes.      Therefore, the 2005 material looks pretty good, though not as good as the best modern HD telecine work and definitely not as good as Braveheart (it received a fairly recent HD transfer), with no trace of Edge Enhancement and only minor Digital Noise Reduction applied.  In comparison, the 2000 transfer for the bulk of the film is a completely waxy, smeared mess devoid of fine detail with EE up the wazoo.    Hopefully, pressure can be brought to bear towards Paramount and Universal and they will re-release this modern-day masterpiece with a brand new HD transfer devoid of all the various problems presented here, and issue an exchange as Sony did with The Fifth Element.     You have been warned!  Avoid Gladiator at all costs and instead spend your money on Braveheart on Blu-ray instead.  Of the two, it's the only \\"Sapphire\\" title worthy of its name.
B000U7169M|2.0|The main problem with The Reaping is that it's entirely derivative: the basic premise is one that has been covered many times before. The film certainly looks good: you can't fault the production from a visual point of view, but what Hollywood fails to realise time and time again is that effects alone do not a movie make. The CGI is very good, with some particularly convincing digital locusts, but it's all too `in your face' and along with the tired plot line and cardboard characters, the film never engages the viewer and therefore fails to scare or shock. The overblown ending is especially unsubtle and unconvincing. There's only one revelation here and that's how sexy Hilary Swank can be!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Great value.  But, if you want a better bargain, you can buy used at Ebay.
B0012GMZ4U|2.0|I don't think this is considered a major Streisand album.  I always think Barbra Streisand was angry in the sixties because a lot of her singing sounds shrill. I want to be able to recommend her 1960s catalog but I can't without some reservations.  I think the one song I can say I really like on this disc is &#34;Once Upon A Summertime&#34;.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|Now that several years have passed since \\"Love and Theft\\" was released, following \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and preceeding \\"Modern Times,\\" it can be compared on a level playing field  against all of Dylan's recent works including \\"Modern Times\\" and \\"Together Through Life.\\"  As a non music-educated listener, and true fan of Dylan for over 35 years (because I like his music, period), this is my favorite among his last five releases.  If you are looking to choose something of Dylan's that best represents what he has been up to lately, and how his music has evolved, I would recommend this be your first purchase (followed shortly thereafter by the other four if you like this one).  It is the best example of who Dylan is, and what his music has become.  Love it, like it, or leave it, the music and lyrics on this album best capture America's evolution from around the 1930's to the present day.  With this album, Dylan has created what could be described as modern American folk music . . . if there is such a thing.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|As the notes of a piano and violin open the album, it's as if someone is lazily- almost from the need to savor the moment that is to follow- putting a white canvas onto a holder. Soon the canvas is joined by soft yet sure strokes of lush color. Though the painting that follows is whatever you, the listener, want it to be, it is undoubtedly gorgeous. The artist is reassuring you that, indeed, he is back- and he is better than ever. As Nate's voice continues to color in the gray grass with vibrant green, and the lifeless clouds with a startling white that contrasts the blue skies, the canvas is not enough. Instead of a two dimensional picture, you find yourself standing in the middle of a world being created. A completely immersive experience- I had left my dark room long behind within the first chorus line. Welcome to Aim & Ignite ladies and gentlemen- consider yourself in the presence of greatness.     After over ten listens to A&I, I have settled on one word to describe it: Epic. A sweet, yet multilayered album that absolutely refuses to compromise on its sound for mainstream accessibility. In today's world of music that's completely disposable, this album is as welcome as an ice cream truck on a scorching summer day. From the first seconds of the album, to the last, there are very few, if any, complaints from me. An album that manages to cycle through so many styles of music, I am humbled by the talent.     Lyrically, this album delivers. From being contemplative throughout the album (\\"I've reclaimed the use of my imagination, for better or for worse, I've yet to know\\") to just the plain sweet (\\"I swear when I grow up, I won't just buy you a rose, I will buy the flower shop\\"), this album is littered with gems. All of which is sung in Nate's beautiful and melodious voice. Though much of the album deals with Nate moving on from The Format and just getting over it all (Take Your Time, At Least I'm Not As Sad As I Used To Be, Be Calm), he also sings on a wide varietyof other things. Most touching of which are the songs dedicated to his parents and his newly born niece, for whom he sings (\\"Now for all the steps you'll take and all you'll overcome, I wanna be the one to put in a song\\"). As I hear the happy words sung, I can't help but wish Fun a long and prosperous musical career.     Fun, which is comprised of Nate Ruess, Andrew Dost, and Jack Antoff, is an extremely versatile band. Couple Nate's talent as singer/songwriter with Dost's proficiency with multiple instruments, and it is obvious why. It also explains the slew of instruments that you will hear throughout the album, making A&I a truly unique treat for the ears. A crew this talented leaves me as happy with this current album as with the prospects of upcoming ones.     Earning a perfect 5 stars from me, Aim & Ignite is lacking in only one respect: more tracks.
0786838655|5.0|After avidly reading through the entire book, I found myself asking, \\"Why hadn't I discovered this sooner?!\\"    The book is a humorous, whimsical, and amazing blend of mythology meeting modern day life. Anyone who is a Greek mythology fan like me will instantly be drawn to the connections made by the author, and find them completely hysterical and enjoyable.    Not only the mythological connections are wonderfully executed, but the characters themselves. Percy Jackson is without doubt one of the most lovable heroes I've ever read about. He reminds me so much of my little brother, with a dash of bad ass in him (i.e. getting kicked out of schools, son of Poseidon, the usual). Although he acquires some similar characteristics as the renowned Harry Potter does (green hair, black hair, \\"Chosen One\\" theme), Riordan has made quite a distinguishing line between both.    While Harry has been born into a world where everyone knows his name, Percy is thrust into one where he has to prove himself to make a name. He has no idea who his father is, is not well liked in school, and has dyslexia as well as ADHD. Only when he enters the exclusive Camp Half-blood does he realize his true parentage, and that's when everything starts to pick up.    Even if his character's aura does seem to radiate \\"Chosen One\\" like Harry Potter's, they are still two completely different people.    More lovable characters would include Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena, and Grover Underwood, best friend and satyr of Percy. Once again, it's easy to relate these two to familiar Harry Potter characters as well. Being the daughter of Athena, Annabeth is branded as one of the most brilliant students at the camp--and obvious parallel to HP's Hermione Granger.    And Grover, with his lovable antics, craving for food, undying loyalty, and friendly nature--most readers would instantly think of the famous Ron Weasley. But although these connections may be drawn by die hard HP fans (guilty) it took me to finally see the creativeness of the whole plot to conclude that all the characters are different.    Many people have complained that this series is too much like Harry Potter, when in reality it is just original within itself. It's the perfect introductory book to the amazing series, and I recommend it to anyone who loves Greek mythology, or just anyone who is itching to escape the complexities of the world of today, and enter the dimension of Percy Jackson.
B000002LCK|1.0|New Order was a singles band who did their best work in the 12\\" format. However, none of Warner Brothers' six - count 'em, six - compilations contain all of those original 12\\" mixes. \\"Substance\\" has the most of them. But it replaces the original versions of \\"Temptation\\" and \\"Confusion\\" with re-recordings - and lops a minute or more off \\"The Perfect Kiss\\", \\"Sub-Culture\\", and \\"Shellshock\\". To remedy these defects, Warner Brothers requires you to purchase \\"Collector's Editions\\" of the three separate albums containing those songs. [If you do a web search for \\"sorting out the New Order compilations\\", you can get full details.]    Well, screw that. All of the music from the original 12\\" records is available for free on the Internet, if you know where to look. You can also get the original sleeve art - something else \\"Substance\\" couldn't be bothered with.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|This is one of the all time best visual Blu-Rays feature films, except for Planet Earth but that's a documentary series, Any-who. All I can say about Speed Racer is \\" It's not what you would expect\\" Back in the day speed racer was a Hooke kookie anime with a 50/50 vision. This move really puts the vision of Speed Racer into a new light. A wonderful family movie that really captures the imagination of any age group. The movie is stunning to say the least with a good enuf plot and great classic caricatures. 5 out of 5 for me, Hope you are as impressed as I was. Enjoy the feature, be good to your self's and each other.
0545123267|2.0|I was really excited to get my hands on this book. It's gotten a ton of buzz, and if I'm honest I LOVE the cover. Also, the print-type for the entire book is the same navy/gray as the cover, and for some reason I found this both appropriate and athletically pleasing (It's not hard to read either. It looks black in dim light).     I enjoyed the first twenty pages of the book. And the last twenty pages were reasonably good. However, everything in between was a total disaster. I know a ton of people loved this book, and I just can't see what they got out of it that I didn't.     It is very much over-written. Instead of a sunset we are given a `screaming red sunset.' Instead of light coming thru a window we have `frigid white light' (and those are both from the same paragraph). In trying to be poetic (a theme in the book), the author constantly lapses into purple prose. The worse being Sam (the werewolf hero) regularly spouting poetry in his thoughts in the form of song lyrics. \\"I was a leaking womb bulging with the promise of conscious thoughts...\\" So... HE was menstruation... coming to life? (That is so disgusting it makes me crack up - And I can't seem to get it out of my head!!!). Some of the metaphors are pretty atrocious too.     The story itself is the same as Twilight. Average girl with oblivious parents becomes the object of obsession of a paranormal boy. Chaos ensues.     I was quite interested in the werewolves - their history, biomechanics (they are scientific not magical) etc. But at the end of the book I knew almost nothing about them.     And the plot has HUGE holes in it. I spent the entire reading saying, \\"Well why don't they just...\\" The biggest example of this is the wolves themselves. If Sam doesn't want to be a werewolf, why doesn't he just move to Coastal California where the temperature is so moderate that the winters won't turn him into a wolf and the summers don't require air conditioning? Problem solved. (And yet when someone suggest to him that he look at other living options he got mad rather than consider it. This kind of stuff just drove me nuts. It makes no sense!!!)     Too many things just happened without having any significance or without being explained. Or they happened so conveniently that it felt forced. Other than the romance, the plot just kind of wandered around.     It is a miracle I finished. I put it down at least twenty times and only kept picking it up because I wanted to find out where the wolves had originally come from. (see paragraph 5 above for the answer)

B0000CDJPQ|4.0|The Sonnet FireWire 400 to 800 Adapter (FAD 824) worked exactly as advertised.  There was no installing adapter software drivers or any other extraneous processes.  You just take the adapter out of the shipping packaging, plug your FireWire (FW) 400 terminated cable into one side of the adapter, and then plug the adapter into the FireWire 800 terminal on your computer, and then use the external device (in my case, a Maxtor One Step II external hard disk drive) with your (in my case, 2009 Apple iMac w/2.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo processor, using Mac OS X, Leopard, v.10.5.7) home computer as normal.  I was able to retrieve information which I had backed up on the external hard drive without difficulty or incident through the existing (FW 400) cable plugged into the adapter, which in turn was plugged into the FW 800 terminal on my Apple iMac computer.    I would recommend the Sonnet FW 400 to 800 Adapter to anyone who is seeking a simple, relatively inexpensive, straight forward interface between their existing FW 400 equipped external devices and cabling, and their newer home computer equipped only with FW 800 terminal hardware.  Nothing could be simpler than the use of this adapter hardware.  I am definitely a satisfied customer.

0375413405|3.0|I like Julia Child.  I often watch the repeats on PBS.  I went to the movie openning weekend.  I came home immediately after the movie and ordered her cookbook - and the companion \\"Julia's Kitchen Wisdom\\".  I have great respect for Mrs. Child.  She was a pioneer.  But we've come a long way - fresh ingredients, better cookware and 'we' are less intimidated.  Buy it as a 'read'.  But if you want to master some french classics..buy the Barefoot Contessa's Barefoot in Paris.  Easier and just as delicious.
B00001U0DP|5.0|Everyone should see this film. The main characters are charming and the love between this family is epic. How can one make a funny, charming film about being in a Nazi concentration camp, impossible but true. I see it at least once a year.
0061231401|4.0|As always James Rollins has delivered an excellent plot twisting thriller that not only leave you on the edge or your seat with the latest installment to the Sigma Force Series, but also he touches on a very touchy subject to us all, the food supply of the world.  The usual cast of characters from the previous Sigma Force novels and continue to grow their characters and relationships in new ways.  The plot is based around the premise that over population and the food supply will cause mass starvation in the future... but is that really what the Guild has in mind.  I won't ruin the book, but this is another thriller that educates while it entertains.  The way Rollins bring to light the possibility of mass starvation because of the exponential growth of societies around the world and the lack of a lasting food supply really gives you something to think about.  I wouldn't put it on the top of the Sigma Force Series of novels, but it is entertaining and the authors research once again is phenomenal.
0385737424|4.0|I read this book to my 8 and 9 year old boys. I found myself wondering when and if the story was ever going to take off. Sure the reminiscing about the 70's era was interesting for me, however my kids didn't seem either interested or put off by it. I found I needed to do quite a bit of discussing the story with them not only to make sure they were understanding it, but also for me to try to figure out what was important to story developement and what was just filler. Literally, it wasn't until I completed the book and discussed it with my children that I really understood what the story was about. I had a hard time following the events and trying to make sense out of them. One was clearly supposed to gain an understanding of the notes predicting future events that Miranda was receiving and how current lives would evolve to fruition of the cryptic notes she was recieving in present day. In the end I got the story, but not until I was finished reading the book. It was strange for me to have such lack of clarity re: the premise of a book which I was reading to my children. My almost ten year old seemed to not have the difficulty that I had because when I had finished the book he surmised it by saying that \\"the future is being determined from everything that is happening now and what has happened in the past, so, in reality the future, the present, and the past are all happening at the same time.\\" There were some interesting twists to the story, but they are not realized until the book was over. There are many nuances within the story which are enlightening re: culture, livelihoods, economics, friendship development, and transitions of such. This is a story of meaning, but perhaps like me, you won't know it until you're done reading it.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Final Fantasy 7 AC Complete is a must have for all Final Fantasy fans. This extended edition of the original is worth buying a Blu-Ray Player for this movie alone. While still holding true to the story for the events occuring after the game, it shows a lot more scenes battle and story wise that makes the movie perfect. After watching the original Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children and then watching this new edition, this newer release is so much more exhilirating and will want the viewer to watch the movie over an over. A must buy.
6304698690|5.0|This version of The Secret Garden has always been my favorite.  I've looked for it in stores for years and never found it.  I actually thought it may be out of print, then happened upon it here.  I immediately purchased it so I can watch it again, whenever I want to.  It was in great condition, at a great price too!  WHOO HOOO!
B00003CX9W|5.0|I purchased the Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 DVDs as gifts for my 17 month old grandson for him to appreciate the music of the master composers before he gets innundated with commercial popular music.  They are animated ancestors of today's music videos, and after seeing the films, one cannot help but conjure up the images that the Disney studios created every time the the music is heard.  My ulterior motive is have the vibrant colors of the superb animation capture the attention of my grandson, and to provide him with music appreciation that reaches far beyond MTV and VH1.     Johann Sebastian Bach's Toccata and Fugue in D Minor opens the show with animation that borders on the abstract, but marvelously combines the senses of sound and sight to increase the enjoyment this familiar compostion.  Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker Suite already well known in its own right and Amilcare Ponchielli's La Gioconda: Dance of the Hours, popularized by delightful and humerous characters created by the Disney studio animators that perform ballet to the music, are wonderful visual presentations of less abstract images that accentuate the rythm of the music.    The animation to Beethoven's Pastoral (6th) Symphony indeed shows the idyllic pastoral foothills of Mount Olympus populated by the Greek and Roman gods and their mythical companions frolicking without human interference. Stavinsky's Rites of Spring provides the musical score to the intelligent design of the Disney animators from the Precambrian Age to the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction event.  The visual interpretation of Mussorgsky's Night on Bald Mountain provides the ultimate Halloween animation that bows to Shubert's Ave Maria with the dawn of All Saint's Day.    But the creme de la creme of the original Fantasia is Mickey Mouse featured in the title role of the Sorcer's Apprentice animating the score by Paul Dukas who in turn put Goethe's poem to music. In fact, it was incorporated into Fantasia 2000 in its entirety.     There is little to criticize in the 60th Anniversary Edition of the original Fantasia.  But one cannot help but notice the failings in the updated soundtrack in reproducing the sound of the string section of the Philadelphia Orchestra conducted by Leopold Stokowski.  The sound is not quite as bad as chalk scratching across a blackboard, but it might have been worth considering re-recording portions of the soundtrack as an exception to the blasphemy of desecrating the original, if all attempts at eliminating the scratching of the violins using modern sound engineering techniques proved futile.  But that alone cannot reduce my five star rating of this masterpiece.
B001QTXM5Y|4.0|I thought the director efforts were a good attempt to remaster the magic that was seen in the amazing comic book. I actually read the comic book when I saw the previews for the watchmen movie because it looked so amazing. I read the comic book with no problem because it was the most amazing thing I ever read, such a different take on superheros, they're misfits, some of them insane, tired of people not apperciating them. I recommend to read the comic book first because if you don't, you may be extremely lost while watching this movie. The constant flashbacks in the movie kind of took away from everything, it was like watching two movies in one. But after watching it for a second time and reading over the book, I understood it a lot more and apperciated the movie because it served it purpose as an entertaining movie and had some relation to the comic book. I was suprised to see how many lines were directly from the comic book. This movie is not for everyone, it is very violent movie but if people watched this director's movie before, they should expect it. But overall, I rated this a good movie. It was kind of similar to the other comic book that alam moore famously wrote, v for vedennta. Though I favored v for vedenta, I did like this movie and I believe anyone who enjoys these kind of doom day super hero, \\"take a stand for justice\\" flims, then they will enjoy this one.
068484267X|1.0|I also heard what a wonderful book this was, so I borrowed it from the library. Although the description of poverty and alcoholism did touch my heart, the lack of love and caring for others, and his failure to notice and appreciate the help given to him and his family made me thoroughly dislike Frank by the end of the book.     I also agree with other reviewers. It did not finish, it just ended, and badly. The writing and subject matter seemed to deteriorate in the last half of the book. The excessive emphasis on his sexual cavorting, increasing reliance and casual acceptance of stealing and taking advantage of other people, and especially the unapologetic admission that he hit his mother in the face while drunk, left me disgusted and made it clear that he failed to develop compassion and the capacity to love anyone.     He judges his mother so harshly for the \\"knee-trembler\\" that brought him into the world, and her \\"excitement\\" with her cousin, (done under duress to provide a roof over their heads!) yet he romps with the wife of a veteran off fighting the war the minute he gets to the US, without any apology. He has casual sex with the dying, virginal Theresa yet only thinks of himself and his own damnation after her tragic death. Where is the understanding for his mother and her moment of weakness that led to a life of misery? Where is the lesson on why the choice of spouse is probably the most important one we can make?     He has nothing nice to say about his mom, even though she stays there for her family and does everything, even begs to provide them food. Instead, he is ashamed of her. We find out almost nothing about her feelings, disappointment, or guilt. Her grief over her dead children is turned into a criticism of her as the reason for neglecting her living children, and he paints her as a nagging shrew who constantly demands money from her husband. Even though his dad doesn't care if they starve, and his misplaced pride, selfishness, and lack of self control causes years of misery and heartache, Frank seems to hold him in higher regard than his mom. Though the book is named \\"Angela's Ashes\\" he does not seem to love or appreciate her, and I can't understand the title. He seems to be blaming his sad life mostly on her.     It also makes the Irish people appear totally hard and uncaring, cutthroat, and unable to love even their own families. He obviously dislikes Aunt Aggie, and didn't seem to appreciate the new clothes she got so he could start his first real job. There is no real attempt to understand the pain of others. I too found the endless description of filth and squalor repetitive and it lost its meaning after a while.     If I had known the ending, I would not have continued to read it. It just leaves me hanging without resolving anything. He dumps his family and selfishly seeks hedonistic release, kind of like his dad, and he never seems to examine himself in an honest way. The book really is just superficial description of sad events without deep reflection and seems filled with bitterness and harsh judgments.      Suffering can build character and empathy for others, but not in his case. I kept thinking he would turn this horrible suffering into a valuable lesson on value and compassion, but he never brings it out of the gutter, just descends further into it. I don't know why this won a Pulitzer, but I don't think it merits such high praise. I also think it was poorly written and could have used some more editing.    All in all, it left a bad taste in my mouth, and was not worth the time to read after the first 100 pages.  I'm sorry he suffered as a child, and especially that the suffering did not help him to become a more understanding and loving person who appreciates goodness. This book does not depict or develop forgiveness, but rather indifference and a lack of depth that leaves me sorely disappointed.
B000YENUI6|5.0|David Cronenberg has always been an edgy, disturbing director - and many of his films are difficult to watch.  Eastern Promises is probably his most accessible film.  There's something old world about this - no fancy turns - just plain old fashioned filmmaking and great acting.  This is why the film succeeds.  I can't praise the ensemble and script enough.  This is definitely Viggo Mortensen's best role.  He's a compelling actor.  Vincent Cassel, who's always good, really finds his groove.  As does Armin Mueller Stahl and of course Naomi Watts.  The interplay and nuances of Eastern Promises makes it more Shakespearan and Godfather-like than a \\"thriller\\" as it's advertised.  It's a thriller played out as a streetsmart chess game.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|I didn't have a problem with my order and I received this boxed set as described.  It was well worth the wait to receive it.  I hope that Amazon is able to fix the problem with the item because all MJ fans should own this boxed set.  I LOVE IT!!!

B000AYEL1A|4.0|When this movie first came out, my friends and I saw this movie around 5 times in the theatre.  I was a HUGE Streisand fan.  Just watched it for the first time since then and must say it is still a wonderful movie. Some things are dated but the movie has aged well. The music includes several songs that still sound good and fresh today. The craziness surrounding celebrities was well enacted although it is probably a 100 times worse now for celebrities. Kris Kristofferson perfectly conveyed the heart and soul of JOhn Norman; you feel how lost he is at the beginning of the movie then his love and pride for Esther and understand his decisions to further her career as well as his anguish when he realizes he destroyed his career.  Streisand is an amazing talent...to be able to sing like that...what a gift she has! Her acting isn't as good as I remember.  Don't get me wrong, she is still better than most, but her mannerisms become annoying. She exudes confidence and owns the stage when performing so had trouble accepting her as a struggling singer. But this is a minor point because this is such a good movie.  So my recommendation is to buy the DVD and enjoy it!
1401219268|3.0|**SPOILER ALERT** The superhero genre was created when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster imagined a bullet-proof crime fighter from another planet.  The genre took another step when Stan Lee wondered how a teenager with the proportionate strength of a spider would deal with the challenges of adolescence.  With \\"The Watchmen,\\" Alan Moore pushes the genre even further.  What happens when superheroes wrestle with a morally ambiguous world?  Deal with mental illness and depression? Grow old?  How does the world react to a hero who is seemingly omnipotent?  What are the social, political and cultural ramifications of heroes in tights?<br /><br />Following these issues to their ultimate end is what makes \\"The Watchmen\\" classic.  The multiple plots and the endless allusions make for dense reading, but they are done well.  The authors understand the conventions of the medium, and they stretch them.  They create a world that is rich and textured.<br /><br />That being said, the graphic novel is very dated.  I can understand why the movie didn't do well at the box office.  The market in 2009 for movies about an alternative 1985 in which Richard Nixon is still president must be pretty small.  In the book, the Cold War and the threat of nuclear war dominate ever page.  The ever present threat of death and destruction pushes society to the point of neurosis.  \\"The Watchmen\\" outlines the transition from the moral clarity of the early superheroes to nihilistic confusion.<br /><br />This descent is probably what bothers me most.  The underlying assumption of the book is that there is no purpose or meaning in life.  All of the major characters accept this worldview without question.  No one in the novel stands for an objective reality.  As the Comedian demonstrates, fighting for truth, justice and the American way is laughable.  God is dead, yet the novel does not celebrate.  There is something sorrowful and regrettable that moral clarity has no foundation or basis.  In one of the last scenes of the book, a group of New Yorkers try to do the right thing by intervening when an argument gets out of control.  All are slaughtered in a monstrous act of random violence.  We lament their deaths and their pointless desire to help their neighbor.
B002DKGWSE|4.0|This is a remake of the Wes Craven's low budget 1972 cult favorite of the same name. I saw the original, and despite its low budget values,  replete with grainy film images and bad acting, it was one of the most horrifying and brutal films that I had ever seen. Of course, the reality is that the crimes that were perpetrated in that film were just that, and, consequently, it remains one of the most frightening and shocking films to date. It was truly chilling. When I saw that there had been a remake, I would curious to see how it would compare. I would have to say that in the shock and awe department, the original still holds sway. Still, the remake is an excellent film and, though brutal, somehow less frightening.<br /><br />The storyline is every parent's worse nightmare. A teenager, Mari Collingwood, goes with her parents to their rural country house. She takes the family car to meet a friend in town.  Unbeknownst to them, an escaped killer named Krug is on the loose with his rescuers. Mari and her friend hook up with a creepy but cute guy with whom they end up smoking weed with in his motel room. Then his father, his crazy girl-friend, and his uncle show up, and all hell breaks loose. They are none other than the escaped killer and his rescuers.  Clearly, they are not going to let these two girls walk away. What happens next will chill the viewer.<br /><br />This gritty and raw film has excellent production values, good cinematography, and the cast is a definite an improvement over that in the original. The controversial rape scene is brutal but probably mirrors the reality of such a crime, and the reality of it ain't pretty. Garret Dillahunt is definitely a standout as the ruthless escaped killer. Likewise Tony Goldwyn, Monica Potter, and Sarah Paxton are also excellent as the beleaguered Collingwood family. Overall, it is a remake that stands up well to the original, as well as on its own merits. Although the film is very similar to the original, there are some differences, though in the long run, these differences do not really make or break this film of a family fighting to survive under circumstances most of us would prefer not to think about.  Word to the wise: this film is definitely not for the squeamish or faint of heart.differences, though in the long run, these differences do not really make or break this film of a family fighting to survive under circumstances most of us would prefer not to think about.

B001OQCV2Y|1.0|Dear God I'm disappointed with this film . I'm not going to spoil it , but the film is NOT the master peace some reviewers say it is .... it's more of a peace of ****.<br /><br />The movie opens up with the introduction of the \\"Jew Hunter\\" and the sequence seems good and is like any other Quintin Tarantino film with two (or more)people just sitting there talking (Reservoir Dogs , Pulp Fiction , Death Proof , .... you get the idea) and the cinematics are great , there's a good look and feel to the film , and then we're introduced to \\"The Bastards\\" after the \\"Hunter scene , and then it's all down hill from there .<br /><br />To some it up as simply as possible , after the first 15 min. of the film , you'll be board to tears till the ending when the assassinations start . The worst and most pointless scene is in the basement bar with that completely pointless German S.S. officer  going on and on about the \\"British spy's\\" bad German ascent. Yes we know the Germans are on the look out for spies , and yes we know they're paranoid , but it just keeps going on and on and on and on and it won't end . However , when it does end , there's a good payoff that should have come sooner . The pacing of the film is horrible and if your looking for a action film , this won't satisfy you .<br /><br />The end was good , but it wasn't worth sitting and waiting for 2 1/2 hours for.<br /><br />Just my opinion.
B00005JMCN|1.0|Seabiscuit is one of those movies where the director/producer are given everything they need to make an awesome movie:  good cast, good concept, good story. Then they blow it. This movie makes every fiction writer's most beginner-level error: it starts in the wrong place. Viewers spend an hour watching the history of car making in Henry Ford's factory, the Stock Market Crash of '29, and various other pictures and headlines from American History 101. Why? Who knows. It the invention and factory production of the automobile have nothing to do with a long shot horse and rider winning a race. Somewhere around the middle of the film reel, the story begins. And it's a good, solid story. Tobey Maguire is miscast as a character nicknamed \\"Red\\" who's supposed to box in organized, low end fights for money. There isn't a tough, take-a-left-hook bone in that kid's would-be shattered mandible. I need a Mark Wahlberg here or Matt Damon here.     Because of all the unnecessary backstory and history shots, sadly, the viewer feels little for any of the main characters, which one needs to in order to make a film like this emotionally power packed. We're introduced to so many characters over such a span of time with so many disconnected information, that developing a sense of sympathy for any character, even Seabiscuit, doesn't happen - or doesn't happen to the extent it could and should have. Sure, watching the film there's enough interest in the horse to ask, \\"Is that him, winning?\\" Or say quietly, \\"C'mon Seabiscuit\\" as the horse runs for the finish line. The horse makes the mark. The movie doesn't.
B000SEGCRS|4.0|I'm gonna to review the kindle version of this book, since there are already tons of reviews about \\"the contents\\" of the book, but not really the kindle version. Firstly, the price is halved. With that said, you are not going to have the paper version quality of the book, and $10 dollar still seems a bit steep consider following drawbacks. Secondly, it's a black-and-white version, meaning, you don't get to see the nice colorful pictures as in the paper version. Well, to be fair, you know the kindle is black-and-white only, so you would expect this at the very beginning. Nevertheless, the pictures (in the gray scales) are decent, and helped to illustrate the photography points. Thirdly, the book is converted to the kindle version very cheaply. I mean, it just feel like someone used a cheap software to convert the pdf into a hacky e-book, and you would expect amazon's official version does better than that: the pictures and tips are no longer fit in one page (well, granted since you can change the font size on kindle), and you often see a half page picture with no text below it; but more importantly, sometimes the text got cropped at the end of a page, and you see a wacky black half line there, fortunately, the next page recovers the last two lines in the previous page. The content of book section is usable for jumping into different chapters, however, because each tip deserves a hyperlink there, you need to flip many pages to get to the next chapter.    To summarize, the kindle version of this book is usable, with a few cracks of bad formatting. The gray pictures are somewhat helpful, though definitely worse than the colored ones on paper. The only one benefit of the kindle version over the paper version is that it does not add weight to your existing kindle :p, and slightly cheaper price.    With that said, this is a great book for digital photography. The tips are very helpful, and the book is fun to read.
0307269981|5.0|i loved this book. i almost didn't want to finish it. the character development is unreal. the heroine is one of a kind, you root for her, even though sometimes you may not like her. she is true to herself and totally real. kudos to mr larsson, may he hear all these praises in heaven......
0060555661|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet.    This is an 'old' classic. Wish I had read Graham 10 years ago during the internet boom/bust.  would have changed my approach to markets significantly. Everyone quotes Graham, yet I have met very few who actually read him. This investment book is my number 1 recommendation. Lengthy, yet easy to read and filled with good stuff.
B0000029LG|5.0|Michael Jackson is like no other singers, his songs and music are always so emotional, heart felt and the sound and production so rich and full body, that it is just at a different level. Having been listening to his music for the last couple of months, I recently tried other artists on iTune, because I was afraid I'm becoming addicting to him. They just don't compare, even those classic ones and catchy ones, a lot of the productions sound coarse, ametuarish, sluggish and simplistic. Like comparing products/goods of any category, one just need lay his music side by side with any others and the differences are immediately seen. Of course I'm not saying other musicans are not appreciated, different moods call for different type of music. I think because of the intensity of his music of many songs, listening to him after his passing just make the recovery from sandess and grief that much harder. I understand why fans leave teary comments, cry all over and just can't leave YouTube site. If you allow yourself, you'll lose to his music.<br /><br />I simply love this CD, not just the old songs, but all the new songs, even the angry ones -- they are intense and punchy -- you appreciate it more if you know what Michael Jackson has been put through in 1993.<br /><br />Added bonus for buying the CD, I was delighted to discover that Jackon can draw. The CD booklet features a portrait of a little boy (Jackson himself?), I later found out that Thriller 25th Anniversary Edition also features a couple of drawings by him. What a talent in so many areas!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|The movie itself is great, but the picture quality of this Blu Ray sucks. I hope they will issue a version with a decent transfer, this movie deserves one.
B001QOOCTE|3.0|The Playing for Change Project involves musicians from around the world, adding their touches to a variety of popular classics (Stand by Me, One Love, Biko, A Change is Gonna Come), and a handful of originals.  The stated focus is to promote peace through music, and they do so, largely through benefit concerts.  The CD/DVD is designed to promote the project and the concerts.    It's a good turn through all of these songs, utilizing local musicians from countries nearly everywhere, focusing on the US, Europe, and Africa.  India and Nepal make appearances, but East Asian countries aren't anywhere to be found.  But what's really important here is the music, right?    There are great moments here.  The opening version of \\"Stand by Me\\" is at once ebullient and fraught with meaning, and the closer, \\"A Change Is Gonna Come\\" is a great piece of soul.  In between we have a few flirtations with reggae and folk.    I guess what's missing here is that nearly all the songs are traditional western forms, and the makers didn't open them up to a more interesting world-beat interpretation.  I'm not a big world music fan, but a good way to explore the new is through the gateway of the familiar.  Add that to the fact that both Bono and Keb'Mo are on board as ringers, and it makes a project that smacks of righteousness when it should have exemplified togetherness.  The musical message here seems to be 'togetherness via American music.'      While I think the intent was noble, and the music enjoyable, it falls short of what it could have been.  If they really want peace through music, maybe they should bring the varied cultures as well as the musicians into their mobile studio next time.
B0026S1XDM|5.0|First things first, Tubular Bells is, for my money, one of the best pieces of music of the 20th century. Not even TB II, III or 2003 could possibly change that, but they have over the years dampened my enthusiasm for Mike Oldfield. So the question is after these, why would I need yet another Tubular Bells? Well, sell your old copies and get this collection.<br />First up there is the 2009 remix. For what it is, it's great. What is it? The usual scrub and polish, everything's-up-in-the-mix that everyone's doing these days, and it's really lovely. The 1st disc also contains both sides of the Mike Oldfield single (previously available on the boxed set) Necessary for the Vivian Stanshall \\"Sailor's Hornpipe\\".<br />The 2nd disc is the original 1973 stereo mix. Perfect. Every other version is a distant second to this one, and I am very thankful that this was included after all of Mr. Oldfield's grumbling and second-guessing over the years.<br />The 3rd disc (mis-labeled disc 4) is the surround sound mix of disc 1. I'm sure it will be fun, but I have not listened to it yet. The real treasure of this set is the visual content. Tubular Bells part 1 live in the studio. My jaw hung open as I was treated to a beautiful rendition performed by a \\"who's who\\" of 70's prog rock: Gong's Steve Hillage, Mike Howlett and Pierre Moerlen; Soft Machine's Mike Ratledge and Karl Jenkens; Fred Frith from Henry Cow; Rolling Stone Mick Taylor and others. I understand that this footage was released as a part of the Elements DVD, but I had never seen it before. I would have gladly paid $20 for this alone and given it 5 stars on its own.
B000002JEV|5.0|I think I pretty much have all the recorded history of this great band.  As a avid follower of these guys I would have to say that this recording really shows the deep improv skills of these great musicians.... For people who think that they know what Zeppelin is all about give this a listen.... This is Led Zeppelin in the raw.... Charming, delightful, full of soul. For my taste this is a prime cut... Everyone should own this album first.....
B00005A0V0|5.0|I bought this CD for I have the the LP but my turntable is no longer hooked up and I wanted to hear this music again.  It is definately worth owning the CD. All the songs are great. Golf Girl, one of my favorites, is a charming ditty about a golf girl selling cups of tea on an English golf course.  The songs just flow from one to another and they are just great!  I  love all the songs on this CD!  I highly recommend it to people who also like King Crimson, Genesis and Gentle Giant.
B000A6T1JU|5.0|very happy with the movie and service, arrived quickly and was the great movie that I  wanted
0545123267|2.0|I feel terrible for not liking this book especially when so many have given it such rave reviews, but I really didn't like it. I WANTED to like it very much, but it just didn't do anything for me at all. A lot of the plot points didn't seem well thought-out; they seemed randomly thrown together especially the whole ending with the meningitis. I didn't buy the reasoning behind the werewolves not being able to move to warmer climates. It just seemed like the author didn't want the solution to be so easy as to move somewhere else -- ok, I can respect that but meningitis? Seriously? My cousin nearly died from it, so it's not the best way to solve problems, even if you are a wolf. I think more thought could have been put into the plot. The writing style is lyrical and poetic, but it's not enough to write beautifully; I think the story needs to make sense, too.    The two alternating points of view could have worked if the characters didn't sound exactly the same. MANY TIMES I had to flip back to the beginning of the chapter to confirm whose head I was in. Except for Sam being the one who likes art and music, and Grace being the \\"practical\\" one who likes to cook, I didn't see many differences between them.     The literary and artistic allusions were a nice touch. The other pack members were intriguing and I would've liked to learn more about them, especially the alpha male. The love between the two characters was somewhat more believable than other YA novels where the characters seem to fall in love randomly without even having anything in common. The best character was definitely Sam and I could feel the pain of what he had been through.    Grace's friends may as well have been non-existent because they were barely mentioned, and they didn't seem to have any personality whatsoever. Her parents were very aggravating. If the author didn't want the parents to be in the picture so that Sam could conveniently have stayed in Grace's house without being discovered, I think sheshould've made the main character an orphan who lived with her senile grandmother. That might've been more believable. Her parents seriously need to be looked at by social workers. They were absolutely terrible and I know there are parents like that in the world, but it also seemed like the author was just trying to get them out of the picture.     The plot was slow-paced and it took me forever to finish this book. It was rather boring at times. I think it could've been a lot shorter. I hope I'm not being too harsh; this book was recommended to me and I thought I would like it but I really didn't. I guess it doesn't take much to keep teenagers interested these days. Take two characters and make them fall in love, then throw in some random conflict about why they can't be together, solve the conflict in some ludicrous fashion and voila -- a bestseller is born.
0316017922|5.0|Loved the book. Couldn't put it down. We all know that things are not always they seem. Malcolm Gladwell offers the reader a different way to look at the world.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|I don't understand, why adults have so many complaints in their reviews of this movie. This movie is meant for children, so let them speak out! I have 8, 6 and 4 year old boys and they really truly loved this film. If an adult wanted to yawn during watching it, it was just his problem. Kids enjoyed it and that's all what matters, or not? Little boys love playing with the dinosaurs, they love to watch them in movies (from Land Before Times to Jurassic Park), so when this movie was supposed to come out during summer, we were among first its viewers. Oh, we laughed, it was amazing to see my kids enjoying movie so much. The whole story is cute and very original. Scrat again delivers and his \\"girlfriend\\" is remarkable! I can't wait for DVD to come out, so we can be again among its first buyers.
B001GKJ2FW|3.0|The Blu Ray version is one of the best transfers I've seen on this platform.  The colors are saturated and sparkling.  The film version of the hit musical offers stunning production values and memorable ABBA tunes with updated arrangements.  What's not to like?  While traditional Hollywood musicals often featured singers of less than stellar talents (e.g. Fred Astaire) these stars were usually paired with someone who was an A-list singer.  A frothy, fun musical doesn't require extraordinary acting skill, so having Meryl Streep in the lead role is a bit odd.  If the producers felt the picture needed someone of that stature, it would have made more sense to go with someone who was also an accomplished singer, such as Glenn Close.  The time-honored alternative is to dub the singing parts with a ghost singer, which is what should have been done for Mr. Brosnan's part.  The off-key, lackluster singing really drags down this otherwise beautiful film as many of the musical sequences are quite long. It reminds me of Ross Hunter's forgotten musical production of \\"Lost Horizon\\" which as doomed by its cast of casual singers. You might want to rent this film before you buy to determine if you'd really want to view it many times.
B0019X3YXM|4.0|In the market for a romantic comedy, and adoring Elisha Cuthbert, I snagged this used at Blockbuster.  I quickly realized it was more drama than comedy.  But like the lead male character Charlie (winningly played by Jesse Bradford), I wanted to see what Jordan was about - and \\"how the story ends\\".  While some found the ending contrived, I didn't see it coming - although the hint was there, if you were looking for it.  Guys, the chicks will LOVE this movie.  And it reminded me of how I too used to yearn for finding that kind of romance in life.  Keep the kleenex handy - and not just for the girl watching this with you.  It does get a little long, but it's worth the wait in the end.
6304698682|5.0|Thank you for the dvd, it works great and I have had no problems with it.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best of its kind...tough yet achievable goals are set throughout the dvd and for some inexplicable reason this lady Jillian keeps you motivated.... I just wish the dvd had a few more features and guidelines, one tip--if you can handle an 8 pound dumbbell without pain go for a 5 pound one with Jillian, the dumbbell weight can be your doom !
B000BPFBVW|5.0|From stem to stern, this is a very good album.  Ray Charles adds a lot of soul to the songs featured here, which serves to make them all the more enjoyable.  \\"You Don't Know Me\\", \\"Do I Ever Cross your Mind?\\", and \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" are 3 of my favorites, with \\"Sinner's Prayer\\" almost having me fall off the seat with laughter.  One track, in particular, has really caught my ear, \\"Unchain My Heart\\" with Take 6.  I would guess that Ray had passed before being able to record that song with them, and I would have loved to have heard him on this song.  That would've been awesome!  Still, Take 6 makes very good work of the song, though.  Love what they did with it.  This is my favorite song on the album, by the way.<br /><br />Again, this is a very good album.  Sorry that I slept on it so long, but oh well.  I have it now, and am enjoying it, and that is all that matters:)
0786856297|5.0|My 14 year old son wrote:    The Lightning Thief by Rick Riogorran is captivating and thrilling tale of a twelve year old named Percy Jackson who discovers that he is the son of the greek god Poseidon. The story follows his journey from Massachusetts to California on a quest appointed by the greek gods themselves.      Percy Jackson was a twelve year old with dyslexic eyes and ADHD. Later in the book, it is revealed that his dyslexia is actually his ability to read ancient greek inscriptions, and his fast reflexes and battle instincts urging him to keep moving is mistaken for his ADHD. While he goes on his mission, h is accompanied by two of his friends, Grover and Annabeth. Grover has the hindquarters o a goat and tiny horns on his head. Annabeth is the daughter of Athena, goddess of wisdom. Thus, Annabethís planning abilities are extraordinary. Luke was also an important character. Reckless, skillful, and arrogant, Luke is a secret agent of Hades and is determined to kill Percy. His accomplice, Felix, is a hellhound that Luke had used twice to kill the son of Poseidon, changing from human to vicious dog in seconds. Besides the hellhound, there was another creature there, Chiron the centaur.  A wise 230 year old centaur with an uncanny addiction to dog food, and had it not been for him, the hellhound would have killed Percy on the spot.      The plot of ìthe Lightning Thiefî was very straight forward, yet had an extreme turn of events near the end that was completely unexpected. It starts out that Zeusís master bolt from his throne, a weapon with the power of several nuclear bombs. Percy is accused of stealing the bolt of lightning and Zeus gives him ten days to return it. As Percy embarks on this treacherous journey, he realizes that it was Luke who had stolen the bolt and accused Percy, pinning him with the responsibility of returning it. This was Luke and Felixís plan to discredit Poseidon and kill Percy at the same time.      The setting most of the time took place traveling from place to place, but the rest o the time was spent at a summer camp called Camp Half-Blood. Itís a training camp for the sons and daughters of the gods. Sword fighting, archery, sports, and fighting skills are all taught at this camp, providing the ìgodlingsî with skills necessary for being great people. This was where Luke had sent Felix to kill Percy in his sleep.      I loved  this book, it had all the things I enjoyed about fiction and sci-fi. Suspense, action, and unexpected twists and turns in the plot. Iíd give this book 10/10.

B002EWD08Q|5.0|Artic monkeys is not interested in writing the same cd twice. This cd shows their growth as musicians and style.  The cd is dark but so rythmic.  Josh Homme of queens of the stone age makes his presenced known.  Best album of the year easily. It might take a few listens so give it a chance. I only wish there were more than 10 tracks. Will see them live when they come in LA.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Ok, First I am an Original First Generation Trekkie, A Geek and Proud of it.  I also Love Anime & Manny Manny other things.  I LOVE THIS BLU_RAY set!  THe New Effects are treated with GREAT RESPECT for an ICONIC TV series. THE ORIGINAL VERSION IS ALL THERE IF YOU WANT TO WATCH IT THAT WAY.  This is SO Good I am Very Happy.  NOTE:  I bought this as my first Blu-Ray And bought my first Player just to see this.  IMPORTANT: SAMSONG BD-P3600 Blu-Ray player has Seamless Branching Problems, that as of 08/29/09 have no firmware fix and no help from Samsung. I know this as I bought one, and after 3 months still was unable to watch without having scenes repeat several tine in each episode !  PLEASE make sure that this problem has been fixed first before you buy.  I got an exchange though Best Buy. I Now have an LG BD390 that works GREAT.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|This is a great movie.  Went to it without knowing anything about it and it blew me away. Please release it on Blu Ray soon. I realy want to add it to my video collection.
B002ECEFR6|5.0|This is still a great read after all these years. My parents are in the habit of buying me books they hear about on radio talk shows. It's always hit or miss but this is one of the first they bought me and the return flight home couldn't take long enough (how often do you wish a flight is longer these days).<br />The movie is exceptional and as true to a book or an actual event as I have ever seen but if you love the movie (and this is really in reverse order from my own best practice and what I usually recommend) read this book. The book will deepen your appreciation for Scott's film and further inform you of the events.<br /><br />And in the ongoing global war on terror this will also provide some very essential background about what led us into the current affairs of state. This is the crescendo of the NATO and Marine led \\"humanitarian\\" efforts in Somalia that resulted in Osama bin Laden's proclamation that American soldiers are simply \\"paper tigers\\". Of course we know differently, standing corrected by not only this well researched and very detailed book of their acts of heroism (2 posthumous Medals of Honor and almost 20 other major commendations) but also by bearing witness to the way the U.S. military has conducted all its operations since 9/11. This is why this is still an important book worth reading.<br /><br />Mark Bowden seems to let the Sec'y of Defense and the Clinton administration off the hook in his epilogue but all the other pages between the covers do not seek to politicize or spin events, telling very plainly the actions, the words and the thoughts of the soldiers and aviators who were involved in this battle and in a fashion that takes a very chaotic series of events and strings them all together in a chronological and well organized narrative involving so many different points of view - something I've rarely seen done before to this degree; really only by the likes of Ambrose or Cornelius Ryan.
0345495004|5.0|WOW!<br /><br /> I do not know if I will be able to review this book properly or give it all the props it deserves. This is a time when I wish I was really good with words and fully express how great this book was and how it really touched me. I guess, those words will have to be enough. I just hope they do it justice.<br /><br /> I have been wanting to read this for some time, as I am quite fascinated with Frank Lloyd Wright, but know virtually nothing about him except that he was a BRILLIANT architect in a time when people wanted gaudy and pretension and not brilliance.<br /><br /> To some extent, this story is about him. And what he was about, and his total and complete passion with building and the lines and spaces he was obsessed with. But, this story is mostly about Mamah (MAY-mah)Borthwick Cheney, a lovely HIGHLY-EDUCATED (in a time when women just weren't educated at this level as a rule, and gifted with languages) society woman, who (when her husband suggests they build a new house) meets and then falls in love with FLW and engages in an affair with him. This book is the story of their love affair and how it completely and utterly shocked the world and forever changed their lives and those who were in it.<br /><br /> Weaving fact and fiction together masterfully, the author uses what she researched and what she made up very well. Without the notes at the end telling you what is fact and what is fiction, you would believe it was totally fact. And for the most part, it is. People are added here and there to fill in the gaps, but this IS a true story. These two people existed (though little is found about Mamah in FLW's stories at his houses and workshop)and loved in a time when loving outside of marriage was a HUGE taboo. I completely fell under the spell of this book and it has stayed with me for days since. I just cannot get this remarkable woman out of my mind. And why I cannot agree with WHAT she did, I totally understand WHY she did what she did. What wouldn't we do for true, complete love??<br /><br /> FABULOUS READ!!!!!!te love??     FABULOUS READ!!!!!!
0061706620|1.0|The book does not agree with facts said on the show. It is not true Supernatural.
1594202249|2.0|I know Pynchon is a genius, but why are these wacky, totally improbable characters, principally a perpetually-stoned hippie private eye in the psychedelic sixties of southern Cal, thought to be so interesting? Just for the sake of craft?  The book recalls last year's A Fraction of the Whole (Aussie Steve Toltz), same thing, brilliant writer albeit of a much different time and place, enscripting, as though on a prolonged acid trip, crazy people who could never exist, and as a reading experience exasperating and all but unfinishable.  One might not frequent public housing projects much either, but the several outliers in Price's Lush Life are at least plausible, as are Shtenygart's and Chabon's fantasylands.

1591841992|4.0|Dan Roam's engaging handbook to communicating & selling through simple illustrations on backs of napkins is remarkable in its foundation of common sense.  Just go into any book store & skim through the illustrated books; you can tell by the dog-eared pages, those are the ones that are getting the most attention.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out.<br /><br />That still doesn't mean there aren't millions of dry, non-illustrated books out there; there most certainly are.  But, I don't necessarily enjoy reading all of them; or digesting the information very well, if I do.  People like illustrations; and we like humor.  We learn better when we can be visually stimulated and being entertained in the process, is a no-brainer.<br /><br />I spent over a quarter of a century in the business world, as a sales & marketing guy; I can attest, from personal experience, some of the best deals our company put together were sealed with some simple strategy like Roam discusses in his handy guide.  Napkins are certainly not just for wiping away food any more.<br /><br />They're the modern day replacement for the spreadsheet, assuming you've got a good felt tip pen to get your visualization across.  How true; a picture is indeed worth 1000 spreadsheets!

So I purchased both wanting to make sure I had read the first book before the new release.  It ended up being a great surprise!!  I loved how different the plot was and how captivating the story line was till the end. I'm now anxious for the 3rd book to be released in America.

B00273D3Z2|5.0|This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version of Michael's best-selling album is a real treat for fans.  Not only is the sound quality remastered very well but the mlps gatefold design itself is very well designed and assembled using very good quality cardboard and very faithfully replicates the original vinyl lp even down to the inner jacket.  It shows that if they want to, Epic Records can do some very good work with mlps designs.  Also included is a glossy booklet with the lyrics in both English and Japanese as well as a fold out mini-poster of Michael; another 28-page booklet is included with all the lyrics in both languages as well.<br /><br />I don't know if it's because I have heard the album so often over the years as although I think it is very good, I would rather put on \\"Bad\\" or especially \\"Dangerous\\" on my cd player these days which still sound very fresh to me today.  That said, \\"Thriller\\" has aged pretty well and will stand the test of time as a great classic of pop music.  The decision to collaborate with other artists on the album was an excellent one and the contributions of McCartney, Price and especially Eddie Van Halen cannot be over-stated; Eddie's solo on \\"Beat It\\" is still one of the best ever recorded and Price's one take monologue voice over for the \\"Thriller\\" track is a classic.<br /><br />Great sound quality, excellent content and brilliant mlps design make this version of \\"Thriller\\" highly recommended.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|My first purchase of a Star Trek DVD series. A must-have for any Trek fan, whether it's to revisit the episodes you remember from their original broadcast or to view for the first time. The series is, remarkably, as fresh now as it was then, and would match or better any series currently on-air.    The packaging manages to squeeze seven seasons' worth of DVDs into a reasonable volume, but does look fragile and only time will tell whether it will hold up over the years. DVD is a good-enough medium for the series; potential future releases in other media (e.g., Blu-Ray) would really have to have added-value to be worth considering.
0321544080|4.0|Before buying this book I read many of the reviews lamenting the \\"missing minutiae\\" of how each image was shot. I'm so glad I bought it anyway as I the strength of this book is that it does not try to be a step by step recipe for reproducing Joe's truly sensational images, instead it explains the creative journey - of each image, of being a professional photographer and of telling stories through image making .      Sure, there are a multitude of technical factors behind the making of each image, which if followed to the letter would still not result in the consistently great work that Joe produces, because along with the technicalities each image also encapsulates creativity, hard work and years of experience.    Personally I found the little nuggets distilled from 30 years of Joe's experience to be the wonderful, useful takeaways from this book that will hopefully help my own photography improve - regardless of whether or not one has access to the kinds of equipment the book describes. The text is entertaining, filled with anecdotes that reveal a great deal about making photographs using light and composition as powerfully as possible. It's also about how to make what you are standing in front of more interesting, for the photographer and the audience. It got me back to thinking about the photograph I'm taking and the story it's intended to tell and the way it will be viewed by others who don't know the back story of how I got the image.     Should you read this book? If you're a photographer as Joe says `interested in standing in front of more interesting stuff or making what you're standing in front of more interesting', then there's something you can learn here.  On the other hand, this is not a \\"how to\\" book, it's a book about photography as a creative process. To get the most out of it, you probably need to have some knowledge and experience to put with Joe's nuggets of information for it to really 'click'.

B000WS4OUW|5.0|This album is a monster! When this first came out back in 1990 I was surprised with how different it was from the first album. This album has a great variety of styles from blues to metal to rock. The album kicks off with one of my favorite Danzig songs ever, \\"Long Way Back From Hell\\" which is moody and fast. Glenn's vocals are at a peak on this album. He really hits some killer high screams like in \\"Girl\\" and can sing softly like in \\"Devil's Plaything\\" which are both amazing songs. Glenn's first all out blues song \\"Killer Wolf\\" reminds me of Howlin' Wolf meets classic Elvis. They lyrics continue in the satanic vein which I think ads to the \\"danger\\" of Danzig's music. The production is much different on this album than the self titled. While the album is clear, it is not as \\"dry\\" sounding as the first album. If you are new to Danzig, this is a great place to start with a great variety. You will never get bored here. I highly recommend this one!!

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Is Meryl Streep perfect in Mamma Mia?  Just about, though everything else carries with it the least little hint of could have been better.  When they announced the movie and said that Olivia Newton John might be playing Donna, we all cheered, and then when it seemed like Michelle Pfeiffer was getting the nod, we were even happier.  Frankly, Meryl Streep gets everything nowadays, can't they give it to someone whose career could use the boost?  But she can sing and of course she can act up a storm.  Donna never seems to think twice about what she is going to the Greek coastline with her enormous tourist hotel and employing all the Greek islanders as her gofers.  How does she pay any of them I wonder, if the business is as bad as she claims?<br /><br />How did Amanda Seyfried get to meet those two bridesmaids who seem to have wandered in from a movie like BLOW-UP--tall, leggy, older supermodels indistinguishable from each other, not a single personality between them.  They just make Sophie look like a midget, can she really be that short?  I used to like Seyfried, but her goofy swoons every time her mother sings are too forced.  I like exuberance, but hers is cooked up like heroin sizzling in a spoon.  And yet, she's not awful, and in fact she does a pretty good job convincing us that she really wants to find out who her father is.  This must speak to a lot of people who don't know their fathers, I guess, but for the rest of us, it is not motivation enough--it is the opposite of motivation--countermotivation perhaps.  Amanda Seyfried and Dominic what's his name have chemistry during their big number Lay All Your Love on Me, possibly ABBA's sexiest tune, but otherwise I'm looking at him wondering what the big deal is.  A star of tomorrow, I don't think so.<br /><br />What a missed opportunity for Meryl Streep to have introduced Abba's \\"JUST LIKE THAT\\" to the world.  ABBA fans know that \\"MAMMA MIA\\" the stage musical actually had a \\"Just Like That\\" scene which was trimmed during out of town tryouts.  Here she does a fine job with \\"The Winner Takes It All,\\" but no one can actually perform that one better than the original by Agnetha Faltskog... maybe Meryl Streep is too levelheaded a person really to put that song over.  Is she ever really down, or does she find a little bit of hope even in her darkest hour?  With Agnetha we knew that everything in the universe was and is and remains doomed, for the gods, cold as ice, throw a dice and decide our fate.own tryouts.

B000BWI9U0|3.0|When this album came out, it was highly anticipated by me.  'Is This It?' and 'Room on Fire' were (and still are) staples in my listening library and I loved the hell out of them.  When the Juicebox single dropped, I was pumped and loved the song.<br /><br />Too bad for me that, unlike the first two albums, I couldn't listen to this one from front to back.  Songs like 'Ask Me Anything' and 'Ize of the World' light speakers ablaze with great ferocity, but drab crap like 'On The Other Side' and 'Fear of Sleep' just bring the entire record down.  Those tracks, plus 'Red Light' and '15 Minutes' are skipped over continually.  How were they included, but the highly superior b-side 'Hawaii' (available on the Juicebox single CD and LP) was left off the record?  Truly perplexing.<br /><br />Still a good record, but they definitely stumbled a bit in the song-writing and composing.
B000JBWWQ0|1.0|I've heard  that the book is 100x better than the movie this film was utter garbage. The acting was poor the plot was papaer thin not to mention bad.

If your into the new age stuff then this is your cup of tea but this will certainly not impress allot of people.
B000WS4P5G|4.0|After listening to the Misfits collection 1 back in 1988 or 1989 I immediately tracked down this self titled cassette from Danzig. What you get is a stripped down blues metal album with demonic overtones. I personally love the production that Rick Rubin gave this album. This is the first album that Glenn Danzig appeared on that really brought his vocals to the front of the mix. Glenn has a deep bluesy sound but his voice has a great range. The drums from Chuck Biscuits are awesome. You hear every hit he makes and it thunders in your chest. Chuck knew how to really add drums to Danzig rather than just following the simple rhythm. John Christ has great guitar tones that are truly unique and compliments Glenn's vocals perfectly. There is not one bad song on the album. The album starts with Twist of Cain which sets the mood well. The album varies in tempo from the slower \\"She Rides\\" to the faster pace of \\"Mother\\". If you like dark music with a hard edge (this is not GOTH) then I highly recommend you pick this up. As a long time Danzig fan, I still revisit this album often but Lucifuge is still my favorite Danzig album!
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|This great script about personal redemption & the values that unite us, regardless of race, is not only laugh out loud hilarious thanks to more instantly quotable one-liners than I can recall in any movie from recent years, but also incredibly moving.    Unlike so many other directors who showboat their style in a 'Hey Ma, look at me! I'm directing a movie!' kind of way, Eastwood's direction is like a gentle breeze, it's so light, so delicate, you're barely even aware of it. Instead you're right where you want to be be; engrossed in the story & gripped by these wonderful characters. And what a story!    Walt Kowalski (Eastwood) is an elderly widower surrounded by Hmong immigrants with foreign ways that he despises, living in a decrepit neighborhood & pestered by his own ghastly family who can't wait to shove him into a retirement home so they can grab his house. He keeps his own home & property neatly tendered, in stark contrast to those around him. Walt is, in effect, the proverbial civilised man surrounded by the barbarians.    But when Tao, the shy Hmong kid from next door is pressured by a local gang into trying to steal Walt's beloved Gran Torino, the stage is set for a culture clash. That Walt ends up befriending Tao probably won't come as a surprise but the exact manner in which Walt warms to his Hmong neighbors, his mysterious guilt over an incident from his Korean war days, how Tao learns to stand on his own two feet & the presence of the Hmong gang who haven't forgotten Tao, are developed & resolved in wholly unexpected ways. We think we know where this is going simply because we've all seen Eastwood films before. But just as he did with Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood has one heck of a surprise in store, an ending that not only cuts deep but makes perfect sense & in ways we had not anticipated.    To say more would spoil the fun but Eastwood's fearless, pull no punches approach to race & culture is an absolute blast from start to finish, & Eastwood the actor is electrifying in the lead role. There is something thrilling in the way a nearly 80 yr old man can hold the screen so effortlessly. Other stars lose charisma as they age but Eastwood's only seems to increase. As one reviewer noted, this is possibly the only film in the history of American cinema in which a 78 yr old man convincingly kicks the ass of a guy 60 years his junior!    Aside from Clint the young cast of non-professional Hmong actors are all fine with Bee Vang (Tao), & Ahney Herr (Sue), believable & likable as the young Hmong teens next door. They have an un-Hollywood quality to them that makes their performances pleasingly natural & amongst the professional cast Christopher Carley (as Fthr Janovitch) & John Carroll Lynch (Martin the Barber) are excellent.    I don't believe for a second that this is Eastwood's final screen performance & after Gran Torino's huge success - it ranks as Eastwood's most profitable film ever at the box-office - the studios doubtless can't get enough scripts to him fast enough. But if it is then Eastwood has found a role that's the perfect capstone to the urban tough guys he's so memorably played over the decades.    When Walt walks off to that final showdown, quite willing to go to the wall for those who share his values, it's impossible not to sense the ghosts of Harry Callahan & The Man With No Name walking with him. \\"The world is nothing more than all the tiny things you left behind.. \\" runs the beautiful ballad sung by Clint & Jamie Cullum that closes the film. It's just one of many pearls of wisdom in this profoundly moving, hugely entertaining & beautiful work of art.

B0002W18MU|4.0|Volume 5 in the minimalist setting which brought the Man In Black back commercially.<br />The title of the CD is well-taken, from a great Frank Sinatra record, \\"Love's Been Good To Me\\"; like the rendition by The Chairman Of The Board, it's beautifully arranged and presented.<br />We go from so-called middle-of-the -road to Gospel Quartet territory, with \\"God's Gonna Cut You Down\\", also known as \\"Run On\\", by Cash's \\"Million Dollar Quartet\\" buddy, Elvis A. Presley.<br />Another good track is \\"Further On Up The Road\\", not the Bobby Bland number.<br />The only unsuccessful offer here is \\"If You Could Read My Mind\\". JC's approach is first-class, but the Gordon Lighfoot classic demands a certain phrasing which, at least on this take, was just a little rough.<br />The CD closes with \\"I'm Free From The Chain Gang Now\\", something in the Hank Snow/Jimmie Rodgers vein; this one really scores, as it is perfectly suited to Cash's dour but soulful Country Blues side.
B000000I3O|4.0|This was the first tape (yes, tape) that I bought of the Misfits back in 1988 or 1989. Yes, I was one of those who heard Metallica cover the Misfits which led me to picking this tape up. While this is not the definitive versions of these songs, it is definitely a great starting point. This has many great classic songs like Bullet, Astro Zombies & Skulls. If you are not very familiar with the Misfits, they play catchy punk rock with b horror style lyrics. What really separates the Misfits are the demonic howls of Glenn Danzig. His contrasting vocals with the upbeat music makes for a great time.  The songs are timeless and I never get sick of hearing these songs. If you like punk or metal, this will appeal to both styles. I would recommend picking this up then immediately picking up Static Age or Walk Among Us to get the best feel of who the Misfits were and what they were all about before their demise in 1983. The current version of the Misfits are a far cry from the days of Glenn Danzig. Again, this is a great starting point but if you have the money to spend, just pick up the Box Set which is full of goodies.
B0021L8US0|4.0|I won't repeat what's said in the 60 reviews preceeding this. Doubtless you realize that it's a relatively low budget sci fi thriller set in South Africa that's had generally positive reviews by the critics--especially compared with Hollywood's usual crop of conceptually stale by-the-numbers action thrillers.<br /><br />However, my wife found the violence and language too off-putting for her. I didn't mind that, but after seeing it in a theatre and going home and reading a bunch of reviews on the Rottentomatoes website, I was surprised to find that not one of them mentioned that this film was designed to be watched on a big screen TV at home.<br /><br />To wit: it uses 16:9 big screen TV formatting rather than the normal movie theater widescreen ratio. And it's filled with tight close-ups and medium-range shots, which again optimizes it for TV viewing. Something like \\"Master and Commander\\" was great in a theatre, with beautiful, crisp, cinematography and shots that really exploited the movie theatre scale and format.<br /><br />I'm not complaining about the director's choosing to optimize this film for DVD. Many films are, and that's fine. It's a good format, and I've enjoyed watching many films on our 46\\" Samsung LCD TV. I am complaining about all those movie critics missing this fact, which was glaringly obvious in the first 5 minutes. If I'd known this I would have waited for the DVD.<br /><br />BTW some critics didn't like the performance of Wikus, the central character. I thought he was fine, though, and so did my wife, and both of us are film buffs who love Kurosawa and other high art directors. He plays a doofus who's hamming it up for the documentary crew. But the actor isn't hamming. It's the character who is.<br /><br />Some of these critics really should be working in a shoe store or something.<br /><br />As sci fi films go, this isn't as fully realized as, say, \\"Serenity.\\" OTOH the script is vastly better than anything George Lucas ever \\"wrote.\\"<br /><br />Really this is in the Hollywood B movie tradition, with both that tradition's faults and virtues. It's gritty, downbeat, morally complex (think Todd Browning's \\"Freaks\\"), with an efficient plot and some very effective, somewhat grainy (purposely so) visuals. The image of the giant floating spacecraft is iconic.<br /><br />So I'd say see it on your wide screen when it's released that way; warn those with queasy eyes and ears to leave the room; and don't expect one of those everything-neatly-tied-with-a-bow endings.<br /><br />[...], with both that tradition's faults and virtues.

B001QOGY72|4.0|\\"Taking Woodstock\\" is based on the book by the same name which is the true account of Elliott Tiber, one of the people who saved the Woodstock festival.  The film is produced by Ang Lee, of \\"Crouching Tiger\\" fame.      Forty years ago, in White Lake, a small New York town in the Catskills, Jake and Sonia Teichberg (Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton) were struggling to keep their hotel running. Their son, Elliott  (Demetri Martin) was donating his time and income to the effort. Elliott, who volunteered to be president of the town's chamber of commerce, convinced the bank to give them just a few more months to make the payment. He's going to have the music festival for the second year and this time it's going to be bigger and better....    Little did they know...     When Elliott discovers a nearby town turned down the Woodstock festival, he contacts the producers and discovers that Michael (Jonathan Groff) is a friend of his from the old neighborhood. Using the permit Elliott's gotten for his own festival, they decide to put Woodstock on in their town instead. In just a few weeks, they have signed up local farmer Max Yasgar (Eugene Levy) to host the festival on his farm and a whole host of characters show up to help.  An odd cast of characters from the town Vietnam vet, Billy (Emile Hirsch) to a cross-dressing retired Marine Vilma (Liev Schreiber) show up to help in their own ways.     Key to the drama, though, is the relationship between Elliott and his aged parents.  He's given everything to the business in the hopes of maintaining them and their esteem while he's not told them about his own lifestyle. Elliott's coming-of-age is very much in parallel to that of the growth of the Woodstock festival and subsequent free lifestyle.     Note:  this is a film about sex, drugs, and rock and roll. Not so much the rock and roll element, but you will see drug use and naked bodies. I'd recommend this film to the young at heart, but not the very young for that one reason.My only complaint was that we only really heard snippets of the music as a backdrop to the story. For me, Woodstock was as much about the music as the characters. Still a very good film, though.     Rebecca Kyle, August 2009
B001TKMAGW|5.0|If you are a Sabbath fan, you will definitely want to pick up this version which I feel is the definitive version! This has the song that started the demonic side of heavy metal with the song BLACK SABBATH. The album is of course amazing and if you are just getting into the classic era of Black Sabbath, this is essential. The sound quality is perfect for disc 1 which also includes Evil Woman which for years was unavailable in the USA. Disc 2 is what collectors will really want this for. This has outtakes of Black Sabbath, The Wizard and Behind The Wall of Sleep. This also has an alternative version of Evil Woman which is quite interesting but it is quickly obvious why the original version was picked. The packaging is great compared to the US version or the mid 90's castle remastered edition. This has detailed liner notes and pictures from the original LP version. If you still need convincing, it is Black F***ING Sabbath! Pick it up, you will not be let down!

B001TOD9VI|5.0|It is dissapointing that the Academy Awards is allowing ten nominations next year. Had it been this year, The Wrestler would have been nominated hands down. Even that aside, I felt this movie should have been nominated instead of Milk, which I felt was nominated because of one reason, which I will not utter.     This movie is NOT a wrestiling movie. Yes, it is about a wrestler, yes it has wrestling in it, but the fact of the matter is that it is about a broken down lonely man who tries to cope with a NEW life.    I cannot praise Mickey Rourke's performance enough, he is without question outstanding, almost like he was born to play this movie. In fact, I have always liked Mickey Rourke, I think he is an outstanding actor, but has been in some lousy movies which have really affected his career.    However, as much as Rourke is phenomenal in this movie, Evan Rachel Wood steals the show. Her performance should have garnered her a supporting actress nomination, AT LEAST! She is an incredible actress with a lot of potential. She will win an Osacar someday for sure.     I think this movie was very well directed and had a great flow. The ending is very good, and it really tells you how this man shows what the TRUE love of his life is.
0141439513|5.0|There's not much point to reviewing a classic like P&P--I've read it 16 times and found more to admire each time. But I've always wondered about the \\"songs\\" (Chapter 6) that Lizzy performs before giving way to her dull sister Mary. Was she really singing? I guess not, since the subsequent refs are to the instrument. During the time of P&P's writing and for a few years thereafter the English Scarlatti cult was in full swing, so the CD \\"Scarlatti as chosen by Clementi\\" is worth while listening for hardcore JA authenticity fans. Clementi was associated with the Broadwood piano manufacturers and the album contains pieces chosen from Clementi's influential English edition of 1791. Emilia Fadini plays these pieces on an English c. 1800 repro piano with some fire--I can easily imagine Elizabeth wowing Darcy and the crowd with K 381 (track #3). Anyway, the recording gives some perspective.

B00000AOTZ|4.0|The year was 1979,         music was the leader of expressionalism where culture and ideas clashed with one another. This soundtrack MIMICKS everything in the actual movie. When you hear the \\"Furies Chase\\" you immediately remember the scene. Barry De Vorzon sounds are all wonderful, the only reason why I purchase this soundtrack. Then you have great music like \\"Love is a Fire\\" by Genyan Ravan. Her voice is definitely up their with Stevie Nicks in the rock world.     I say overall 6 out of 10 track definitely was worth buying. There maybe a few other if you're into smooth Latino or a Joe Walsh fan.

B00192IV0O|1.0|This album is clearly not the best from the Black eyed peas. And it's sad because this group created some of the best tracks in the music world. This Album clearly was an experiment. And it failed big time.    The techno twist is good for the rave/dance generation, but I believed the idea in this album is over worked. I listen to techno and new age digital rhythms without any shame. Darude is a master in the works. This is a fail attempt by the Peas. I know they had great success in the past and want to broaden their horizons with new material, but this album does cut it for me. Not one track! I can see Kanye West swimming in the cotton candy bowl with his bubble gum beats and present some success by his actions, but the Peas have no business in that same bowl.     Stay with Hip Hop and LEAVE the Synthesizers ALONE!     my opinion

My family enjoyed the game as much as I did, and we have spent many hours playing.<br /><br />One of the biggest appeals is that the game is never the same as the board tiles change randomly each time, leading to endless replay. The strategy which helped you win last time may not be the best option in the next game.<br /><br />Besides the original game, there are many variations and expansions which deeply enhance game play.
1400034779|5.0|I read the first four books in this series when I was recovering from an accident.  I got hooked on them.  I love the characters in the book, I love the descriptions of the landscape and the people of Botswana.  They are great light reading.  I am so glad that they are making a tv series based on the books.

His conclusions are considered by the doctors and registered dietitions (that I know) as valid, but they still do not recommend them to their patients and clients.  Since the \\"experts\\" won't tell you the honest truth each of us must read the book by this honest author and take personal responsibility for our own health based on this work.

B001I10ABO|4.0|Many people on this site among many. Have said that Metallica sold out with this album. I think that the sound on this record suited then well at the time.To people that bash others for not liking the album. Find something better to do with your life. Everyone is entitled to an opinon. I have the CD of Black Album, and it sounds good. However, this is not the page for the CD, so why is everyone reveiwing the CD here? I have not seen one user here comment on the Vinyl Re-issues sound quality. This is the page for the 2 LP vinly (Re-Issue). Have some sense here people. Use your f***ing noggins!

B001KL3GWM|2.0|Just ok. I've seen him play so i know he could have done a lot better.
B000025JJ4|3.0|I used to have this album. I feel that it was a far cry better than \\"Perfect Strangers\\", \\"House Of Blue Light\\", and \\"Slaves and Masters\\" combined. Ian Gillian is back at the mike to croon his usual fare. The title track, \\"One Man's Meat\\", and \\"Time To Kill\\" especially \\"Time To Kill\\" are the best. It was a shame this was overlooked in the days of grunge and thrash. This showed the group still had what it took to rock. As I said it's a far cry better than their first 3 post reunion albums, but it's not good enough to be a classic. The songs are recycled, but done in the traditional Deep Purple sound. Hopefully they'll continue to rock even though Jon Lord is retired, and almost 70. It's good to have them back.

0061767581|5.0|I really wasn't expecting much from this book but I actually really liked it.  I didn't really like the ending I wish they would have at least finished off the plot.  They stop the book right at the climax of the story, but other than that it was really good.  It was interesting to get a behind the scenes look at how reality shows are filmed.  This is a quick read, it's not going to change your life or anything, but if you're bored and have nothing better to do you should read it.
B000002V07|4.0|I found this to be a interesting album that made me think back to \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" that 1967 classic album that blew everyone's mind back then. Mind you that was 42 years ago, and it's been 15 years since \\"Fade Into You\\" became a big hit. I still don't like \\"Fade Into You\\" as it's depressing. However, they all sound the same, but I did find some songs that stood out as pretty good. \\"Mary Into Science\\" was one, another was \\"She's My Baby\\", \\"Wasted\\", and the title track. I did sample this album as it's been 15 years since I heard part of this album it was at a corner store where a 17 year old girl worked there, and she had it on one day. I feel that this was a piece of classic 90's rock that was overlooked as a one hit wonder. I actually like the lo-fi sound, and you don't seem to hear it anymore, so that alone should prompt me to play the album in it's entirety. I won't rule it out, but as far as sampling it it's enough to make me be adventurous.
1400082773|4.0|This book was initially published in 1995. There is a foreword added in 2004. By retracing his roots, it seems that President Obama got answers from a personal past that he had not been quite ready to face before. And from a more general, social point of view, we can read about his ethics and values, his struggles to come to terms with a bitter reality about racial issues, and his determination to make a difference, to help out. Reading about his past shed a lot of light on his personality and the formation of his ideologies. Very, very interesting and uplifting.   What I also appreciated is the candour and honesty permeating this personal memoir. Lovely writing, indeed.
B000GYI32M|5.0|Arguably the most controversial season of the four to date. I bought this Season a few years ago from Amazon because I didn't want to wait any longer here in Australia! And I'm glad I did because the casing is much fancier than our local editions, here.     I was a late bloomer with the OC, only watching it when a friend let me borrow his pirate copies once season 4 had already began on TV. That wasn't enough for me, I HAD to have my own legitimate copies and have not regretted my decision.     The OC is dramatic, interesting and yet fun and humourous. The characters all compliment eachother and none leave the viewer rolling their eyes and fast-forwarding to the next episode in boredom. I've watched the series twice now and will watch it again down the track. There's something magical about this show, something that 'just works'. Check it out, suitable for a wide audience. 10/10.
B0000844I8|5.0|The first time I saw this movie I said this will become a classic, the dvd is explendid.  Do I need to say more it is Stargate.

This DVD set kind of sets up what's to come with this crazy threesome (later fivesome with the addition of their other oddball friends). I'd recommend you buy this DVD if you're a big fan of the show. Otherwise, wait til it comes down in price.

0312370849|5.0|In this book, Tatiana DeRosnay creates two parallel stories which eventually intersect and each completes the other.  One story takes place in 1942 when a young Jewish girl and her family are rounded up by the French police who detain them before sending them to the Nazi gas chambers.  The second story concerns a modern-day journalist who discovers the fact that the French turned Jews over to the Nazis and decides to write a story about it.  The journalist has troubles of her own and her pursuit of the truth threatens her husband's family and her marriage. This is an engrossing story which is based on an actual incident and is one of the best books I've read in awhile.
B000WS4PCO|3.0|This album has some amazng songs on it. Don't get me wrong. But once you get past the first 3, it kind of goes downhill from there. These guys are great musicians, but this album doesn't stick to one particlar style...it kind of goes everywhere. Maybe worth downloading some of the songs, but not purchasing the whole album.
031606792X|5.0|As the mother of two daughters, a toddler and a 6 year old, I have too little time to waste on unworthy books.  As sure as I would tuck my children into bed at night, I dutifully returned to my Bella and Edward saga.  As saddened as I was to see it end, I am delighted with the conclusion.    Yes, it did tie everything up in a tidy little bow, but I have enough sorrow and hardship to experience in the real world.  When I sit down to my precious few moments to myself...I'll take the imprinting of Renesmee as a reason Jake finally moves on and I am perfectly at peace with an anticlimatic fight scene between the Cullens and the Volturi.  (As these seem to be the two themes most Twilight fans are trouncing).  Readers, this is a work of FICTION. If I want reality I will look over my daughter's latest math quiz or follow the latest trajedy in the local news.    Also, having a degree in English literature, I am not easily impressed or entertained.  I can truthfully say that with the Twilight saga as I whole, I was obsessed.  I found myself following the fan sites and even loaded my Ipod with Stephenie's recommendations.     And now...I am a bit heartbroken to say goodbye to my friends in Forks.  I eagery anticipate Midnight Sun's release and hope we can return to see the Cullens in the future. I have my trilogy above my desk and fondly pull it down to re-read some of my favorite chapters. I will gladly hand these over to my daughters when the become of age...what could be wrong with encouraging abstinence, true love, loyalty, and friendship?

B0000AQVCL|5.0|Some people don't like looking back at bands like the Beatles and hearing their influence in newer comtemporary bands, and if you are one of those, than you probably won't dig Jet.  Every new band is influenced and sounds like another, that is just a simple fact.  If you like a mixture of styles, old and new, you just might love this album.  If you've heard \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\" on the radio, with the thumpy bass line and tamporine than you should know what to expect.  They are a driving band with a funky sound and with the addition of piano and organ they can show extreme depth as well.<br /><br />check these songs out from Get Born:<br /><br />Look What You've Done - This song gets me everytime I hear it, it's freaking amazing.<br /><br />Move On - Beautiful<br /><br />Radio Song - Fell in love with this song!<br /><br />Cold Hard Bitch - speaks for itself, you've probably heard it.<br /><br />Are You Gonna Be My Girl - groove it out, dig!!<br /><br />I do not agree that these guys are formulaic at all...if you can write a song like Cold Hard Bitch and then turn around and write something like Look What You've Done, that is not a formula.  A formula is when every song sounds the SAME, for instance, Linkin Park, Lamb of God, etc.  If a band has any dynamics at all, I wouldn't consider them to live within a formula.  Try it out, you might love it.  I did, this band surprised me.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Some readers may remember me from my X4 review. Here we are a little over a year later and I am once again tearing into the box of a shiny new pair of Turtle Beach headphones. I liked the X4s, so why did I invest another $200 on the X41s? Because the X4s had some issues, common issues included sound glitches at certain frequencies (press the B button in Shadowrun), interference from other IR sources (like the Wii sensor bar), and a noticeable hiss when using the voice function. These issues did not ruin the X4s, in fact they were still one of the best gaming centric headphones, and THE best wireless gaming headphones, but the issues could be annoying. Thankfully, the X41s claim to fix everything wrong with the X4s and add some new features to boot. Do they live up to the hype or have hidden issues?    For the rest of my review I will be doing some comparison to the X4 in every aspect of these X41 headphones, as well as comparing them to the other options available. I may leave out some details that I already covered in my X4 review, if something doesn't make sense or you would like more detail check my X4 review to see if I covered it there. In this review I will mostly be pointing out what has changed from X4 to X41. Finally, I personally own 6 pairs of gaming headphones, from the aging AX360 to the Astro A40 and X4. I will be giving my opinion of the X41s performance compared to my experience with most of the other competitors on the market.    Headphone design and feel:   The X41s really shine in this area, like the X4s they are extremely light and comfortable. In addition, they have added a new type of breathable fabric to the pads which keeps your ears cool and comfortable through hours of play. They have also increased the size of the space for your ears. The end result is headphones that are easy to forget exist. The headphones are well built in every other respect. The Bass boost switch is now a button, the headset is black rather than grey, most of the other changes in this area are minor. The X41s are an improvement over the X4s and one of the most comfortable of all the headsets I have used.    Audio Quality:  One of the big draws of the X41s is the new DigitalRF which claims to increase sound quality while decreasing interference and hiss. This claim is completely factual; the X41s have excellent sound that rivals even top level wired headsets. In addition, the X41s have fixed all of the X4s sound glitches, no more will you hear disturbing static or interference when a certain frequency is played. In my experience the X41s reproduce the game sound perfectly without any degradation from being wireless.    On the other hand the extremely low level hiss is still present in the X41s, though perhaps even quieter than the X4 ambient hiss. As I said in my X4 review this constant hiss is impossible to hear if any game sound is playing, and is probably mostly amp noise created by the 50mm speakers an inch from your ear. It is nearly impossible to engineer something like the X41s and completely remove this type of hiss. Thankfully, the X41s do remove the increased hiss when using voice chat that was present on the X4 headset. With the X41s you cannot tell the difference between having the voice chat hooked up and not using it. With the X4s as soon as you plugged in voice chat the normally unobtrusive hiss would double or triple in volume and become quite noticeable. This is a pretty major improvement for the X41s, as the hiss while using voice chat was a common complaint of the X4s.    The X41s have also enhanced their Dolby DSP to handle up to 7.1 surround sound and PL2X. This is not as noticeable as the Digital RF but it is an improvement. The excellent surround sound from the X4s is made even better, and it is even easier to pinpoint exactly where a sound is coming from. The surround sound here is really fantastic, don't believe the hype about \\"true 5.1\\" headsets that have multiple speakers in each ear, this Dolby processing creates a better surround sound experience. In addition, because there is only 1 speaker per ear the speakers are much larger which makes the excellent audio quality possible. Comparing the X41s to my Tritton headsets is really one sided, the X41s are hands down better in every way when it comes to audio quality. Bottom line, 2 great speakers and Dolby Processing is far better than 8 tiny speakers.    The short version here is that the X41s are a worthy improvement in terms of audio quality. They have fixed essentially all of the major problems the X4s had and added some new features as well. The X41s perform very well when compared to wired headsets also, for the same price you could not find a 5.1 headset with better audio quality than the X41s, and the X41s are wireless.    Other Features:  The X41s don't change very much in this category from the X4s. You still get the excellent voice chat implementation, which will balance voice and game audio so that you can always hear everything clearly. As I already mentioned the noticeable hiss while using voice chat has been removed, so that is a major improvement here.     One notable change to the X41s is the new talkback cable that is now free of the puck. This new cable is simply 2 standard mic connections with volume control and mic mute on a little box in the middle of the wire. This cable uses heavier wire than the old X4 cable, and seems like it will resist the rigors of use more efficiently. In addition, because they did away with the puck the X41s are now compatible with any headset connection. This means with the right USB adapter and cables the X41 voice chat can be used with a PS3 or PC as well as the Xbox 360. This is really a pretty awesome addition, and one that is not touted on the box.    The X41s also have a headset jack for a wired headset with its own volume control. This headset receives all the Dolby Processing and the same sound the wireless one receives. This is nifty if you want to have multiple people listening to the same audio on headphones, and is a better option than the X4s \\"buy another $100 headset\\" approach.    The X41s are now powered via a USB cable, which you can hook to your Xbox or any other powered USB port. Not sure if I find this positive or negative, but it is a change from the X4s.    Overall:  The X41s are a worthy improvement over the X4s. The decision to upgrade is something each individual will have to consider, but if some of the X4s flaws or glitches have been bothering you the X41 does a great job of solving those issues. In addition, the X41s add a lot of great features, from Digital RF to the new talkback cable. These features make an already excellent headset even better. As far as gaming headsets go the X41s are among the best. The implementation of voice chat is second to none, and since the X41s eliminated the loud hiss found during voice chat on the X4s, this feature is nearly perfect. The sound quality is excellent, and the Digital RF really does rival wired headsets, and is completely free of audio glitches. You no longer need line of site, and the signal seems very robust and interference free even around multiple wireless networks. The X41s are also significantly more comfortable than the X4s, and the new fabric for the ear pads makes a noticeable positive difference in keeping your ears cool and comfy. In the end, for anyone looking for a gaming headset that incorporates voice and surround sound, the X41s get my unwavering recommendation. They really are the best gaming headphones available right now.    I have rated the X41s 5 out of 5 stars, compared with the X4s 4 out of 5 stars. I would not say the X41s are perfect, just surprisingly close.    Update (Roughly a year later): After a year of using the X41's, with hundreds, or perhaps thousands of hours of play across all platforms. I just want to reaffirm that I still think they are an amazing pair of headphones, and the best wireless sound solution for gamers. A few things that I have noticed in the last year.     First, when the batteries die the headphones often make a violent crackling screech noise (for perhaps a second, very short). This is annoying, not something I find bad enough to reduce the score, but I hope in the next iteration Turtle Beach fixes this, even if it means I get 30 minutes less battery life. I would rather the headphones beeped at me when the battery was low, or perhaps some indicator on the base station could show when the batteries are getting down there. Then when it got critical just make the headphones power off gracefully, rather than dying in a screech and crackle of rage.    Second, they are actually susceptible to interference from 802.11G wireless. In general they work great, but if you position stuff such that some wireless device (be it a router or a wireless client) is closer to you than the base station you can get interference. In general this is easy to fix, for instance I put my wireless devices on the opposite side of the TV from the base station and interference is a thing of the past. It is something to be aware of though, depending on your situation, especially in an apartment or dorm with tons of wireless everywhere, you could have trouble avoiding interference. To fix this perhaps Turtle Beach will switch to the 6 Ghz spectrum and use something similar to DECT. This would increase range, and should completely eliminate interference.    Finally, a quick tip on hooking these up. I found that the best way to hook the headphones up to any modern TV was to plug the X41 power USB cable into the USB slot on the TV (generally used for displaying pictures or similar features). Then use the Optical out on the TV as the connection to the X41 base station. Then you just plug all your devices in with HDMI cables and you can enjoy Dolby Digital on every device without any switching or special adapters. Plus, when you turn the TV off the base station goes off, turn it on, base station is on.In my opinion it is pretty much perfect, and is a joy to switch from watching TV with DD5.1, to my Xbox 360 or PS3 or PC, simply by pressing the source button on my TV remote.    If anyone has any specific questions feel free to comment on my review, I generally try to answer questions posted in comments.
B001F12J48|1.0|I love this movie, but the 3D version is almost unwatchable.  Amazon has great delivery and I have no complaints with them.  I am so disappointed, I would have given this 0 stars if that was an option.  I saw this in 3D at the IMAX and it was great.  It is so blurry trying to watch it from this DVD that it makes your eyes cross and gives you a headache.  Save your money and get the 2D version, it's well worth it.
1416562605|5.0|After the travesty of \\"The Gathering\\" being named the best work of fiction in 2007, I had given up on the Booker as the standard bearer of quality or guide for readers of serious fiction. I am therefore delighted to say that with last year's choice for the prestigious award, my faith in the committee's judgment has been restored. Aravind Adiga's debut novel, \\"The White Tiger (WT)\\" could be the most contemporary and relevant prize winner of the past 5 years. In a year when the feel good movie \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" won the Oscar for Best Film, it is entirely fitting and congruous that a book such as WT that exposes the underbelly of moral degeneracy and corruption infecting modern Indian should be named the Booker winner. Are they not in a sense mirror images of one another ?    WT has been well reviewed so it would be pointless for me to get into plot details or what the book is all about. Suffice it is for me to say that in the central character of Balram Halwai, Adiga has served up a most unusual hero (or anti-hero), a cold blooded murderer - immoral or amoral, it's up to you - birthed by an ancient civilization coming of age in a rapidly globalising world, its position secure as the undisputed favourite outsourcing destination for developed countries. How is this centuries old, rigidly caste bound (and in some ways) feudal society that has a gridlock on the minds and destiny of its inhabitants to make sense of a world order promising social mobility and encouraging every man to believe that he can be whosoever he aspires to be ?     The Stork, the Buffalo, the Wild Boar, the Raven, Ashok, Pinky Madam, etc - they are from the economically and socially privileged classes, and though each of them is better or worse than the other by degrees, fact is, they are finally the same. They are selfish, beastly, lacking in moral courage, and yet able to get away with the most loathsome and unconscionable acts (eg, getting a servant to admit to a crime committed by his master)only because the unwritten rules of society allow them to. The \\"rooster coop\\" is the symbol the author uses to define the numbed mindset of the underprivileged - it is invisible yet unrelenting in its reach. It is up to Balram to prove to himself and those like him that it is indeed possible to redefine one's own destiny. The murder he commits is dastardly, but isn't it entirely conceivable that our Balram could, with a bit of bad luck, be the one rotting away in jail or even executed, for his social superior's crime and wouldn't it just be an ordinary day in the park for everybody else ?     Presented as a series of late night penned letters to the visiting Chinese premier, WT offers a clever and sly critique of modern India and is chockfull of ironies mercilessly rendered in wonderfully humorous prose. It was great fun to read and the fact that it is still high on the bestsellers list more than a year after its publication suggests that it has struck a resounding chord with the reading public. At long last, a truly worthy Booker winner !

B002G4FQI4|4.0|As far as I'm concerned George Benson never makes a bad album!  He has shown marvelous consistency over his many years of recording!  With the release of Songs & Stories, George Benson showcases his stellar singing and guitar playing on a few originals and well worn pop standards we've heard many times over of the years!    I am particularly fond of Nuthin' But A Party (Featuring Norman Brown), Family Reunion, Exotica and Living in High Definition.     Songs & Stories is one of the most subtle cd's George Benson has ever recorded. The tunes have nice changes which I think gives this effort its legs. The vocals are solid but not memorable! The guitar playing is typical yet excellent!    I give Songs & Stories four stars out five. It is as well produced project which yields some exciting results. However, I strongly feel that Benson has yet to record his ultimate!      p.s. Several years ago, I met Norman Brown. I have mentioned to Norman on a couple of occasions that I think he and George should do an album together. It's great that we finally get a glimpse of these two incredible guitar players on Songs & Stories.
B00005QFE5|5.0|[Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\" Get it at Amazon.]<br /><br />This is not as opulently beautiful as some of Zhang Yimou's films but the story is compelling and wonderfully told with deep affection for the characters.  It's a love story beginning in the present with the death of a beloved village school teacher whose widow demands that he be honored by having his body carried--not driven--from where he died to his home in the small mountain village where he taught for over 40 years.  The expense seems extravagant and where will the pallbearers come from?  Most of the young people have left the village for the cities.<br /><br />Returning for the funeral is the dead teacher's son.  He realizes how important this ancient tradition of actually, physically carrying the body home, and so he goes about making that happen for his illiterate mother who is now all alone.<br /><br />The real focus of the movie however is the extraordinarily beautiful face of the then 19-year-old Zhang Ziyi (Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon 2000; Memoirs of a Geisha 2005) who plays Zhao Di, the mother as a young woman.  We are flashed back to the teacher's arrival in the village and to the young Zhao Di doing everything in the exuberant way of first love that she can to catch his eye.  Again and again Zhang has his camera focused tightly on Zhang Ziyi's face as she experiences love at virtual first sight and goes through all the emotions of love's labors.  Pointedly Zhang Yimou shows only her face.  Her body is covered in the padded winter clothes of the Chinese north.<br /><br />In this focus on the skill, charisma and beauty of Zhang Ziyi one sees perhaps the influence of some Western directors like Ingmar Bergman, Krzysztof Kieslowski and Roget Vidam who made movies in homage to the beauty of their young stars, Bergman with Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, Kieslowski with Juliette Binoche and Irene Jacob, and Vadim with Bridget Bardot and Jane Fonda.<br /><br />As always in the films of Zhang Yimou one sees in the background or off to a side a gentle but penetrating subtext on the effect that communism has had on Chinese society.  Here he gives not criticism but guidance as he carefully insists that the traditional ways have value and should not be completely shoved aside.get Bardot and Jane Fonda.

159448385X|5.0|This is a poignant story about (primarily) the lives of two Afghan women in the late 20th/early 21st century. Others have discussed the plot, so I'll just mention the reasons this one has stuck with me (I first read it when it came out a couple years ago).<br /><br />Most important is Hosseini's ability to connect with the reader. I've read a lot of fiction from other cultures, and sometimes have had difficulty in relating to the characters or the story. Not so here. Although Afghan culture and many of the characters' assumptions about life are foreign to me, I was still completely drawn in to the lives of the main characters. Essentially, Hosseini uses Western storytelling tactics to tell an Afghan story, not an everyday feat. (It would be interesting to know whether it still appeals to Afghan readers.)<br /><br />Speaking of Afghan stories, it's refreshing to read a book about Muslims where not all men are evil; there's quite a variety here. Understandable, since the author is male--but then, few male authors portray women so well. And this book provides a window into Afghan culture that most of us would never see otherwise.<br /><br />While trying to avoid spoilers, I'd like to advise potential readers not to be scared off by reports of this book's brutality. It's intense, yes, and sometimes tragic, but rest assured that there's light at the end of the tunnel.<br /><br />A Thousand Splendid Suns, while covering the last 30-40 years of Afghan history, does continue right up to modern times; I didn't see any political statements here (wasn't looking for them, either), but the book did leave me abnormally interested in Afghanistan-related current events for months afterwards: I was that concerned about these characters. Logically, of course, that's ridiculous, but it's a testament to just how amazing this book is. Seriously--read it.

B0018RWD6S|3.0|I'm satisfied with the sound of the \\"Originals\\" digipak reissue of this classic (the one in a cardboard folder with an orange and black strip on the left side of the cover, with the word \\"ORIGINALS\\" on it) but fans of the album should know that this version may be different from the one to which you're accustomed.<br /><br />After the session with Hartman, Coltrane returned to the studio to overdub some extra saxophone on several of these songs. The songs that received the extra saxophone were \\"My One and Only Love\\", \\"Lush Life,\\" and \\"You Are Too Beautiful.\\" As with ASCENSION, two versions of this album were released - one with the overdubs, and one without.<br /><br />The Originals version does _not_ contain these overdubs. For example, the Originals version of \\"You Are Too Beautiful\\" features _no saxophone at all_; Hartman is accompanied by Tyner, Garrison, and Jones only.<br /><br />I actually prefer this unadorned version of the album for its plainer, more spacious sound; the well-known version is spoilt by too much reverb. But some listeners will miss the familiar sax ornamentation on three crucial tracks. Perhaps more importantly though, this version of the album is NOT the one preferred by Coltrane himself.<br /><br />The commonly-available CD version in a jewel case offers the version Coltrane approved.<br /><br />[Edited to correct a mistaken song attribution]

B001SRBWN8|4.0|I'm not sure what I was expecting when I started this novel.  I'm a fan of Neil Gaiman, but had only read one book by Terry Pratchett and had remembered not being that impressed (might be because I had inadvertently read a book in the middle of a series).  This book really does have it all.  There are parts that made me laugh out loud (which is very hard for me to do for some reason).  There are parts that made me proud of human nature.  Overall I was very impressed.  Some times collaborations leave the reader confused and there are obvious transitions where one writer hands it over to the next.  Not so in this book.  It is seamless.  Very well written and highly recommended.
B00005R1JB|5.0|This EP is awesome, it is from the KID A - Amnesiac time, excellent quality of sound, really good performance from one of the best actual bands.
1416550542|5.0|This novel is extremely well written with well developed characters and a story that allows the mystery to evolve in a very clever and seductive way. I suggest that the reader keep a pencil at hand because there is something on every page worth highlighting for future reference and enjoyment.
B00013RC9I|3.0|Breathy electro is weighed down by too much arrangement fluff despite a few genuinely innovative songs, downgrading the disc from amazing to acceptable.
0739383728|4.0|If you are not a runner as I am, it will inspire you.  I found the book very educational and informative.  I did not read this book, I listened to it on audio CD.  Parts of the story line held me captive while at times my mind tended to drift.  I would highly recommend this book to runners and to anyone working in the fitness/healthcare industry as I do.
0822216310|2.0|As a writer myself it's encouraging to see that David Sedaris was once not a very good writer, who became a very good writer.  But in this book his skills are weak.

B002CAWNEM|1.0|Beyonce  should keep her day job. writing of the movie was good. Actors were not. If you are into wasting money buy it. If you are interested in throwing money out the window go see it in the movies. Singers should not think because they have money they can excel in everything.  Honesty I gave it one star because of the plot otherwise it deserves a -star.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|The Blu-Ray release has filtering and over processing in the image. It looks terrible! Do not buy.
B001V9LRV0|1.0|I bought this set with great expectations. However this turned very soon into a major dissapointment for the following reasons:<br />1-Letterboxed single frame sequences. The split frame sequences are alright but the the single frame (around 50% of the film) are letteboxed all over the screen so you end with a pictire with a huge black frame around it for half a movie...the 1994 director`s cut is better<br />2-The sound have not been improved at least comparing to the 1994 version<br />3-The extra footage (really very few, some good performances by Mountain, Joe Cocker,CCR, Johnny Winter and the Airplane and way too much Country Joe McDonald )is not integrated into the film..The Who extras are almost a repeat of the previously released footage...they had 40 years to do it..lazy people Waldeigh and his team<br />4-All available footage is not available here, there are other products that have extra songs not included into the set..they should have included all available \\"in good shape\\" footage in order to justify the price<br />5-The featurettes (what a name for pieces of crap) sholud have been integrated into One mini-documentary for an even flow of the story they are trying to display<br />In summary do not buy this set. Try to get the 6 CD boxed set (back to Yasgur`s Farm) that has very good sound, tons of good music in the correct sequence..still some missing songs available in other releases, but truer to the original concert
B000053V7Q|5.0|The man was a downright electrifying performer.  This video captures the preparation and excitement of his always sold-out Las Vegas concerts as well as many poignant moments when it almost seems he forgot that the camera was there.  Elvis was just a great guy--good looking, big heart, and probably the greatest entertainer of the 20th century--an original from start to finish.  Hat's off to the King!
B001PPGAIA|5.0|My husband and I left the movie theater, swept away after viewing Australia last year and still feel the same way after watching it on DVD, despite the criticisms it received. I planned to buy the soundtrack but was disappointed to learn that only a few songs could be found. This morning, I noticed that the complete soundtrack came out in June, exclusively on iTunes. After listening to the newly downloaded soundtrack during the day, the music is just as compelling as I remember. There are 19 tracks, in addition to a 51-page digital booklet with scenes from the movie and song commentaries. There is a little bit of everything - lush orchestral pieces, harmony from the Ink Spots, opera, Judy Garland, swing, Elton John, and, best of all, the beautiful \\"By the Boab Tree.\\" I'm sorry the availability is limited, but at least the complete soundtrack is now available.
0894803123|3.0|I tried a few of the recipes but they tasted too sweet and so high caloric that I won't use them again. That being said, it is an interesting book as it tells the Ben & Jerry history and some basics of ice cream making. If you are just looking for recipes, other books offer wider variety and a wider range of ingredients.

B001MYIXAC|4.0|From the minute we see a \\"12\\" year old girl as a vampire who connects with a 12 yr; old boy (who is starting to get those urges ) and has a kind of romance I knew I was in for something different. This film was GREAT ! I am someone who does not mind watching either the English or original language for most foreign films. I went for English language and really had no problem with it. The story itself tells more than what an actors lines are. Look at the actors faces, look at the scenery. I could watch it with no language and still enjoy it. A nice timid pace where I did not even want the movie to end. This is not your typical guy in a cape with fangs vampire film, this is something quite different. I bought this on a recommendation actually without seeing it the theaters and was supremely surprised of just how good the story and movie were.<br />Not to give too much away but there was some gore but nothing stomach churning (at least to me) and the film touches upon a loner who is being bullied by other kids in school. What this has to do with vampires is something you will have to see for yourself.<br />I did not watch the subtitles as I just went to the English language which I usually do just to see the movie. I do watch foreign films in original language as well...usually the 2nd time around just to see/hear the differences. I am not too terribly picky. Now I did read about the subs for the DVD release being sub-par because Magnolia did not buy the original subtitle translations or something like that..okay, but is that a cause for a one star * rating ? I rate movies on the movies not so much on what a DVD brings. It is good to tell readers what the DVD is but the rating comes off as don't see it and I am here to say that you should see this movie anyway you can. Watch it anyway you like, the DVD to me is worth getting because it is that good. So while there are * star releases for the movie, that is for the DVD release...Im giving this **** stars, because the movie is outstanding irregardless of what the DVD brings to the table.<br />This is a cross between a horror movie and one of those old after school specials that used to air on ABC :)<br />BLOODY GOOD MOVIE !!! :-)outstanding irregardless of what the DVD brings to the table.  This is a cross between a horror movie and one of those old after school specials that used to air on ABC :)  BLOODY GOOD MOVIE !!! :-)
B000ZLFALS|5.0|This is a short review just to mention that the Blue-Ray quality is excellent.  [...] calls it a reference-quality video.  I tried to find a comment on this aspect in the Amazon reviews, but could not - since Amazon seems to have thrown all the different format reviews together and only one person seems to have the Blue-ray disk (and didn't mention the video quality aspect)!    Relative to the movie itself - I agree with all the positive reviews.  I love the movie.  Having watched it twice on cable, I felt it would be a great showcase video for my new BR setup.  As a child of the 60s, a fan of the Beatles, and one who appreciates a quality production, I would say that the movie itself is superb.  Read the other reviews for more info :-)
0316044695|5.0|A few week ago see saw a good friend of our sons from school. He is a Navy Seal. Then the next week someone in my book recommended The Lone Survivor so we decided it might be a good one to read because of just seeing our Seal friend. Once I started reading I could not put it down. I was traveling and was stopped by two people on the plane asking how much of the book I had read so far and told me how great they thought it was. Then coming back home the pilot ask me how much I had read. He had loved it also. The books makes you proud of our armed forces and the story opens your eyes on the real war.
0312370849|3.0|I selected this book because of the outstanding reviews.  I wasn't sure I wanted to read yet another book about the Holocaust (so very depressing) but I knew nothing about Vélodrome d'Hiver and wanted to read about it.  I loved many aspects about this book, enjoyed how it flip-flopped back and forth from 1942 to the present, and I loved the tension wondering what Sarah would find when she came home and how her life would turn out.  I disliked the saccharine love story with the main character and her husband. I'm glad I read this book but the ending was so sappy it ruined it for me. Soooo predictable.  Do read this book to learn about Vélodrome d'Hiver but try to overlook the sappiness of it!
1592802974|5.0|The question and answer format is great.  The questions give you pointed perspectives about how the pros view the markets and the answers are always bound to have insights that can't be beat in another format.  A massive amount of informtaion in a single source.
1440423911|5.0|The story,  about a tight fisted bitter and selfish miser in 19th century London, who despises all that brings joy and comfort,  has a plethora of adaptations but is best in it's original.<br />Ebenezer Scrooge is visited on Christmas Eve by three ghosts who show him the evil of his ways and its consequences.<br />A Christmas Carol is one of Dickens's most famous narratives, and written in lively, intelligent, penetrating and witty prose, a prime example of Dickens's literary genius.<br /><br />Certainly there is the very strong theme, for which Dickens works are well known, about social injustice and poverty, which we read in such works as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, Bleak House and Hard Times.<br />It is also a ghost story for which Dickens also showed a flare, although his other ghost stories are less well known but equally enthralling.<br /><br />Essentially the story revived the spirit and message of Christmas and contains a powerful social message about those members of the wealthier classes who shun responsibility for the less fortunate people in their country.<br /><br />Such pearls as the following light up this story:<br />\\"Men's courses will foreshadow certain ends, which if persevered in, must lead, but if the courses be departed from, the ends will change\\".<br />Charming and engaging in it's original.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|The Watchmen is a movie about superheroes based on the graphic novels of the same name. It was very well acted and directed and had a fairly credible plot. I hadn't seen any of the graphic novels but the film is supposed to have followed the novels pretty closely. The movie is fairly intense and not for the faint of heart. There is some very graphic violence in it. I enjoyed it and I'd rate it at about 9 on a scale of 0-10.<br /><br />Kerwin Kerr
B00013UTUM|5.0|Let's start off by saying Muse is the greatest thing to hit the music industry since Pink Floyd, and noone in America has heard of them lol.    When I first heard this album was full of B-sides, I was skeptical to buy it. I spent the money and listened to it. This album was unbelievable. It starts out with a very eerie song in \\"Forced In\\", and closes with arguably their best song in \\"Hyper Chondriac Music\\". Th songs in between do not disappoint at all either.    Def. worth the money for such an incredible album.
B001DSNF8C|4.0|I've seen this movie like 5 times already and doesn't get old. I bought the BD 2 Disc Collector's Edition, I gotta tell you that looks amazing. BUT! is has some grain to the BD transfer. Thats why -1 star.
0688014291|5.0|Very interesting take on a great manager. This book is short, to the point and is written like a novel which makes is real easy to read. What I liked about it is its wisdom. It gives you quick but effective lessons on how to treat people that work for you right, how to create the most effective organization through your people and how to free up your own time by delegating and developing experts within your organization. Read it, you won't regret it. I won't recommend buying it though, get it through your local library.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. A modern day tale of life on the streets and the choices that people need to make in order to survive. Clint Eastwood is at his best in this movie.
B001JDSGPI|5.0|My G-D, this book is by far one of the best books ever.  It takes you on a mythical journey, and never lets you go!  YOU ARE THE CHARACTERS, and you can sense your own fate.  VERY POWERFUL! As with any powerful book, the first 100 pages set you up, the remaining pages grab you like a lover, and don't let you go.  I threw the book once during the read, yet another time I put it down, and sobbed.  I never wanted this book to end!
B00297FEUS|1.0|This is far and away the most problematic CD I've ever bought and will be the last Rhino release I ever touch. The first disc sounds worse than the original Atlantic release it is supposed to be a remaster of and the second disc won't play after the third track as it has flecks of something black inside the playing surface. So I just wasted my money completely. There is supposed to be a process to go through to get a replacement disc, but I have yet to get any reply from Rhino Records on what I'm supposed to send to where to get the first disc replaced, and I guess I'll have to try to return the whole thing to try to get a second disc that works. So beware, its not just the first disc that may be defective. I should have just stuck with \\"Still Hungry\\" and the orginal release of \\"Stay Hungry\\" with some equalizer tweaks. Even if I get working copies of both discs I don't feel its worth this much hassle having to do quality control for a company too cheap to do it themselves.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This summer I decided to get rid of the sugar, salt, and caffeine in my diet.  Minimal weight loss result so far but like the fact that I'm no longer addicted to Diet Coke.  Was walking a lot this summer but that takes time.  I'm a teacher so in the summer that was possible.  Now I work really long hours and am generally exhausted when I get home.  I got the Shred DVD thinking I'd try it and see if I could do it.  It was REALLY hard the first day but I made it through.  Really weird thing is it gives me more energy - not less.  I've done this for almost 30 days now - not even close to level 3 yet - I was REALLY out of shape but I'm loving it.  No, craving it.  I'm more flexible than I've ever been in my life and can do a few pushups.  It's hard but well worth it.
B000063UR1|2.0|At this point, this film seems so outdated and the production quality and 'technology' feels more like a made-for-TV episode than a feature film.    I failed to remember any of this when I first saw the movie years ago, and purchasing to watch again was a big letdown.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I found this to be a outstanding interpretation of the book with excellent performances and outstanding production quality.  Why networks don't produce quality shows like this instead of the reality crap (read: inexpensive to produce) that dominates the public airways is beyond common sense.  I went through the entire 3-DVD set in 5-nights, and thoroughly enjoyed each episode in the miniseries.  If more people support high quality historical shows (read: expensive to produce) like this, perhaps the network exec's will come to their senses and get the message that reality is out, and real history is in.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I've been a Lonesome Dove fan for over 20 years and it has never lost it's appeal to me. I've probally seen it dozens of times over the years.  When I saw that it was available on blu ray I knew that I would have to have it!  Boy I'm so glad I bought it! It's like watching for the first time almost. Some scenes are a little grainy but all in all I highly recommend this classic western!
B0015ABRE2|1.0|The third season was in no way comparable to seasons one and two. And you know, that if a show adds a baby to the plot it is on the way down. Seasons One and Two were multi layered. Three was just predictable. The Ice Truck Killer was wonderfully developed. The Skinner was a pathetic parody with very little intelligent development. You knew right from the beginning what Jimmy Smits character was headed for. By the way what happened to Deb's previous boyfriend? Are we just to assume that he headed off for another Serial killer and Deb was just fine with that? Where is all that multi character interplay/tension that was so wonderfully developed in S1&2? Now everybody is nice nice? PS: to the person that thinks Dexter is the best show ever made television. I beg to differ: it was The Sopranos!
0449227421|4.0|For some reason I  never read a book by Follett before, but this won't be my last.  I did enjoy the book.  There were a lot of plot twists that kept me reading and the scientific premis behind it is chilling.  I did have to grit my teeth over some of the political undercurrents in the book, i.e. all consevatives and Christians are evil and liberals will save the world.  I did not like Jeannie either, finding her to be a bit arrogant and cold, the proverbial super woman who has looks, athletics, brains, and tough girl mentality-not to mention the nose ring.<br /><br />I would characterize this as a lighter reading suspense book that does the job.  I will try more of Follett's books.
B000005RT8|4.0|If there was a McCartney album that didn't receive a lot of attention then it must be dismissable listening right? Who doesn't want to heap praise on Paul, if it's good, or lambast him if it sucks. This is the one album that I never heard much about. For me this album is true to it's name. It is McCartney in the moment, jamming in the home studio in 1979-80, just as he did in 1969-70. As a big Paul fan I went back to those rare albums that I only heard on the radio and didn't own. I bought Back to the Egg and was dissapointed. I wasn't dissapointed with this one. I loved the third cut for it's bluesy intent. I loved the way the songs led into each other as well. The album for me is cohesive. There are many gems with a touch of the beginnings of techno here. Oddly enough I liked the B sides stuck on the end of the album. If you want to listen in on a genius while he entertains himself, than McCartney II will do ya. It's a great way to spend an hour, and it really does, for me, reinforce the idea that Sir Paul is just an ordinary guy who can't stop making music....and has earned the right to put out anything that makes sense and is whole. I loved listening in.
B0021L8US0|1.0|I found this movie to be nauseating, both in content (disgusting, upsetting) and camera work (unsteady handheld camera causes motion sickness). I walked out halfway though the movie, making it the only movie I have ever walked out of. I became convinced that if I stayed I was going to be violently ill, either because of the visuals or because of the content of the film.
B000063DFN|4.0|Not Maiden's best album but still great music from when I was a kid. The CD was sealed and in perfect shape. Excellent deal!
0312360266|2.0|I'll be the first to acknowledge that I'm probably not in the demo for this kind of book series, but the Twilight series was good enough to make me want to look for something in the same genre, but hopefully better written.  No such luck here.    The main character, Zoey Redbird, is 'Marked' very suddenly in the hallway of her regular high school, in a sequence that was actually pretty interesting.  The way that first person narrator Zoey described the marking of her as a vampyre and the aftermath was compelling, and it was while paused at this point in the book that I went to the store for other things, and bought Book Two.  Not the wisest move, because it went all downhill from there.    She gets sent off, lickety split to one of the 20 House of Night schools for vampyres in the world, one that oh so conveniently is located in her hometown of Tulsa, Oklahoma.  Quite the coincidence don't you think?  Adventures ensue:  She gets on the bad side of the queen bee of the students almost from the second she gets there, but also falls for the bee's sort of ex-boyfriend, who is smitten by her.  Zoey also hooks up with an immediate group of friends, all four of whom are one dimensional stereotypes, though I'll give the Casts credit for actually doing something with the gay character other than make him comic relief.  The cast includes Zoey's roommate Stevie Rae, their friends Erin and Shaunee, and the previously mentioned gay boy Damien.  The villain is Aphrodite, while the love interest is Erik.  The enigmatic Headmistress is Neferet, and it's never clear whose side she's on, even in the end.    Speaking of which, there is no real ending to the book, given the obvious hopes for series (at the time that they wrote it, of course four more books have come out by now), but what struck me was how fast the book went, the whole thing takes place over what seems like a week.    The problems?  Zoey for starters.  She's perfect in every way, but hyper-critical of pretty much anyonewho's different from her.  She makes it clear many, many times that she's not a slut and won't put out for anyone. She has no trouble, though, taunting love interest Erik about attentions that Aphrodite has given him in the past, while reminding him constantly that kissing is all he can expect from her.  It doesn't help that Zoey is instantly the most powerful student in school, and is good at almost everything she tries, except for fencing.  The girl can't fence......yet.  Is she more interesting than Bella from Twilight?  In a way, I suppose, but in some respects they're polar opposites of each other.  Bella Swan is a dimwit who can barely tie her shoes, and is manipulated by everyone else in her series, while Zoey is beyond street smart and everything she touches turns to gold.  The contrast is interesting, if nothing else, and I'm sure a lot of people came to this series from Twilight like I did.    The friends are her Greek chorus, and the number of times they called Aphrodite a 'hag bitch from hell' made me want to get out a piece of paper and start counting them up.  Erik is bland and blah, while Aphrodite shows some potential in the next book, but is a caricature here.    What went right?  I like the idea of humans and vampyres living side by side with an uneasy truce.  The House of Night was pretty well done too, as well as the varied reactions of 'human' characters to Zoey's marking.    I'm sure the Casts meant well, and while the parallels to Harry Potter are noticeable, they're not as blatant as Eragon ripping off Star Wars.  The book just needed a better set of characters to populate it.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|As I was already a die hard Matrix fan, the BD release was icing on the cake.  Excellent video transfer, very good sound, great special features.  The Animatrix in particular literally jumps off the screen with the increased resolution and color display.  Well worth the upgrade from SD.  Enjoy!
B001H5X7I4|5.0|I checked out some of the one star reviews here and can't help but wonder if you people (and by that I mean one star reviewers) saw the same movie I did.<br /><br />First let me say that I'm not at all a fan of Ben Stiller movies, including \\"There's Something about Mary.\\"  I find him difficult to watch and \\"more stupid\\" than funny.  However, this movie nearly made me spit my beverage across the room on several occasions.<br /><br />I never liked Tom Cruise much either.  To me he makes Keanu Reeves look like Sir Laurence Olivier.  He is great in this movie; easily his best performance...yes, I said it.<br /><br />Jack Black is, well the same Jack Black you've seen him in practically everything he's ever been in.  No surprises there.<br /><br />If Hollywood awared best actor Oscars for ridiculous comedy, Robert Downy Jr. would win in a land slide for this.<br /><br />I confess that I love politically incorrect humor.  Case in point, I thought \\"Team America: World Police\\" was one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  I rated it up there with the original Pink Panther films.  I'm a pretty tough sell for comedy films and for me to laugh out loud at a movie; it has to be screamingly funny.  Tropic Thunder is.  Ignore the nay-sayers.  If you don't offend easily and love comedy that is \\"more stupid\\" (obviously my favorite line in the movie), this is for you.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Wall*E is one of the most visually stunning BD releases I've seen to date.  Superb video, excellent sound and a host full of special features.  Pixar really has done a job with this title. funny, touching with a bit of warning for the future.  I heartily recommend this BD for children and adults alike.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I've seen other live dvd sets from muscians, but this has to be one the best! I've been a fan of his from the 1st time I caught his video for \\"No Such Thing\\". I am hooked on his music. If you are a true musician, you have to know John Mayer's music! Whether you love or hate him, you KNOW him!
B0007OASII|5.0|I am in love with this band. I have never heard a band like this. Most metal in this genre is cheesy to me. I usually listen to more melodic death and doom/death/black metal. I like nightwish and evergrey, so I was recommended this album after I bought a nightwish album. Thank you Amazon! I have done the research and listened to all there stuff. This is one of my top albums. I feel cheated listening to only one song at a time on a short trip in the car. I must listen to this album from beginning to end everytime. All the band members are masters of their craft, but in a band like this, Roy Khan is the highlight. He is amazing, and sends shivers down my spine. I can't wait to see them live! Please come to the USA again.
B00005JNJV|4.0|An intriguing setup for the next chapter, The Dark Knight, this is where you should start.  Not as clownish as prvious treatments of the Batman story.  This lays the foundation for the franchise.  Loaded with special effects as one might guess and shot very darkly to exude an intense forbodding.  Enjoyable and highly recommended.
0684824906|5.0|I have read many books on Lincoln; one of my favorites was a book on his law practice. This book is another biography of Lincoln but it is much more than that. It is an excellent biography of Seward, of Bates, of Chase, of the Blair family, of Welles and of many others in Lincoln's official family. I actually read the book a year ago and, while spending a weekend on my sailboat, discovered it in the reading shelf and began again. I enjoyed it as much the second time. The war is described only as it affected the Washington residents and there is some new information at times. I have also read many books on the war, beginning 50 years ago with Bruce Catton. The Lincoln reader will especially enjoy this picture of his administration and of the personalities with which he surrounded himself. There is quite a bit about Mary Lincoln and the courtship and marriage. There is quite a bit about Kate Chase who is an interesting figure. Stanton appears far more human than in many other books about Lincoln. If you enjoy reading about Lincoln, you should not miss this book.
B001V7YWTQ|5.0|A tremendous live show featuring hits from Clapton and Winwood's solo carrers as well as covering tunes from Bind Faith and Traffic. Classic vocal work from Stevie and hot licks from EC, what's not to like about that?  The finale is a change-up on the J.J. Cale's \\"Cocaine\\" with Winwood dropping stellar keyboard play to counter Clapton's guitar mastery.  All-in-all, one for your collection.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I have read several of the Jeeves short stories by P.G. Wodehouse and have found that Laurie and Fry are spot-on as the title characters in this series.  This is a great series for those who enjoy British comedy and British acting.
0671015206|4.0|Interesting book that profiles millionaires in America, but doesn't go much beyond emphasizing that most millionaires are millionaires because they are frugal.
B00129H7VS|5.0|I remember watching this when it first aired. Every sunday was like waiting for christmas. In my opinion this is the best series HBO has produced!
B000EGFVQS|4.0|I read this book in two sittings.  I felt it was heart wrenching.  From her brutal murder, to her family's grief, to her mother's inability to cope. . this book will most likely make you cry.    This is a spoiler:  The only part I didn't care for was when she traded spots with Ruth and slept with Ray. I felt like that it was unnecessary and didn't really fit. As unrealistic as the story MAY be, that just made it seem ridiculous.

0060989157|5.0|Regardless of what you think of The Crue's music, or even the band members as people, this is one of the better-written rock n' roll autobiographies out there.  Good storytelling at its finest, bolstered by the fact that (as others have noted) all time periods are covered more or less equally, and all the members of the group get to chime in.  You don't get the impression that the author is foisting some view of the band off on you because so much of it is in the members' own words, and they are interesting, articulate fellows, though obviously very different in their focuses. I've read a couple hundred rock books at least, and this one is definitely a five-star enjoyable, fairly light read.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Very cool product. Very light and easy. This is not for heavy duty cleaning. This is for lazy people, who want to do very less effort and keep more clean in less time. Work great on wood floor and even carpets. Do not forget to clean the brushes once in a while. I love it, my wife too and my kids too :)    Perminder.
0684833395|1.0|Being that I like to read, and am often looking for new books to read, I became interested in Catch-22. This is probably because it's considered by many to be one of the greatest books of the 20th century. So I went and grabbed a copy from a local used book store, and took a look at the back and the inside and read many great reviews calling the book \\"entertaining and hilarious\\" and that it portrayed \\"a strong, heartfelt message\\". Naturally, I thought it would be great.     Dead f***ing wrong. This book is absolutely awful. Not only is it horrifically boring, but it's downright annoying. The lack of a real storyline alone makes it unreadable in my opinion, but as if that weren't enough, there's more to this piece of crap that just makes it torture to read. It's plagued with horrible, repetitive dialog and ridiculous characters (that I guess is supposed to be humorous) that makes you want to skip to the last chapter to see how this abomination of the English language ends. The book also has a few running jokes that make you want to stick a fork in your eye. A perfect example: the main character, John Yossarian, is always saying that millions of people are trying to kill him. Oh, I get it. Because he's in the Allied forces, the Axis forces are trying to kill him. Kind of amusing, right? Not after he says it twenty times. Also, there's a character named Major Major Major Major. Hilarious.     And I'm sorry, but I think the message of the book has not really aged well. War is Hell? What? I had no idea! (Sarcasm). And even if the message of a book hasn't aged well, that doesn't make the book bad. An example of this would be Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, another satire that takes place in WWII. Again, the message is a bit dated, but at least that book is well written and entertaining. Not only that, but the message is supported by a first-hand account of the bombing of Dresden, one of the most horrible events of the war in Europe. In Catch-22, the anti-war messageis backed up by five hundred pages of a lazy air-force captain complaining.     So overall, this book is garbage.       *Warning. Contains spoilers*    And just one more thing, I hate the ending. He decides that he won't endorse a statement that the pilots need to fly eighty missions in exchange for a trip home because it puts his fellow pilots in danger. On his missions he drops bombs willy-nilly. Yeah. That doesn't put anyone innocent in danger or anything. Hypocrite.
1934030198|3.0|I found it to be written for a Iron man perspective and I was looking for information on Sprint Triathlons - those for beginners.   It lacked the practical advice I was looking for.  It does have a lot of information, but a lot of it is too detailed and advanced.
B002EWD08Q|4.0|It's funny how expectations and history shape our anticipation.  The news broke a while back about how this album will team up two heavyweights in music.  One a veteran with 7+ albums of great music with QOTSA and others, Josh Homme (Producer) and UK relative newcomers with the fastest selling debut in UK history, Arctic Monkeys (2 albums).  I was looking forward to a continuation of the direction of first two albums.  Albums with energy, riffs and danger.  Don't get me wrong.  It's not like this album doesn't have energy.  It's just in a different form.  The first listen was dissapointing.  I was in the wrong mood for Humbug (lifting).  I actually left the CD downstairs for 2 days before picking it up again.  Second listen came on my drive to work after coffee.  Third on the way home.  I am hooked.  This is an excellent album.  Muted and dense!

1423113497|5.0|I picked up this book series hoping it would be \\"the next Harry Potter\\". The story has various similarities, but Percy Jackson definitely stands apart.  I find Percy to be easily relatable, even if he is a half-blood greek god.  Besides being adventurous, these books are absolutely hilarious.  I have found myself laughing out loud even during some of the most serious moments in the plot.  If I knew anything about Greek mythology, it would probably be even funnier.  Although it is marketed towards kids/teens, the series is an easy and enjoyable read for adults as well.  I can't wait to read the last two books and find out how it all ends!
B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts (3 on the video) are great.  You work several body parts at the same time, so even though the workouts are only 20 minutes, they are worth more like 40 minutes.  The three levels let you build up to the killer moves.  Highly recommend!

B001RTSPVY|5.0|***No Spoiler's Here***     The second season of this AMC series starts right where the first dramatic season left off. From there it winds down a dark path where you can't see what's coming while still managing to up the stakes and get you more involved with the characters with each passing episode. While I wasn't prepared for where this season ended I have high hopes for the third season that will premiere this winter and highly recommend the first and second seasons to fans of well made television. This 4-disc DVD set will contain the following episodes from season 2 of Breaking Bad:     Seven Thirty-Seven  Walt and Jesse try to end their deal with Tuco. Meanwhile, Hank attempts to repair Marie and Skyler's relationship.    Grilled  With Walt and Jesse trapped with Tuco, Marie and Hank comfort Skyler over his disappearance.    Bit by a Dead Bee  Walt and Jesse's become short on cash when they try to cover their tracks. Meanwhile, the DEA has a lead that could get them straight to Walt and Jesse.    Down  Walt attempts to reconnect with his family, while Jesse struggles to rebuild his life.    Breakage  Hank suffers from the aftermath of his encounter with Tuco. Meanwhile, Jesse hires a crew to get their product out on the streets.    Peekaboo  Walt's secret is in jeopardy when Skyler thanks Gretchen for paying for his treatment. Jesse tries to please Walt by 'manning up' and getting back some money that was lifted from one of their new crew, but he runs into complications.    Negro Y Azul  Rumors fly about Jesse's recent actions as he and Walt discuss expanding their business into new territories. Hank struggles to fit in with his new co-workers in El Paso. Skyler pursues a new job opportunity that reconnects her with a former colleague. Jesse gets to know his landlord, Jane    Better Call Saul  When Badger finds himself in trouble with the law, Walt and Jesse seek the legal advice of a shady attorney, Saul Goodman. The DEA believe they may have finally caught upwith the elusive 'Heisenberg.' Hank returns to Albuquerque, but his troubled mental state and demeanor cause Marie to worry.    4 Days Out  Walt interrupts Jesse's weekend plans to inform his partner they'll have to cook for four days straight, or risk losing their batch of methylamine. Out in the desert things get heated between them when they wind up stranded.    Over  With Walt's disease in remission, the Whites throw a party for all those who've supported him through the ordeal, but the mood is ruined when Walt and Hank argue. Skyler is worried about Walt's emotional state as Walt tries various home improvement projects to occupy himself. Jane continues her relationship with Jesse but keeps this secret from her father.    Mandala  Saul suggests a new business partner for Walt. Skyler discovers something shocking at work. Jesse tells Jane about his 'job'. When an unreliable Jesse isn't there at a crucial moment, Walt must choose between an important moment in his familie's life or possibly scoring a big deal.    Phoenix  Skyler deals with newly developed family dynamic. Walter Jr. launches a new website to raise money for the family. Jane convinces Jesse to stand up to Walt. Walt makes a decision, or lack thereof, that sends him further down a path of darkness.    ABQ  Skyler's frustration with Walt's secrecy boils over; Jesse heads further down a path of self-destruction, and only Walt is willing to help him; and a grief-stricken Donald experiences more tragedy. Walt's recent poor decisions have a much larger negative affect on others than he could ever have anticipated.     'Seven Thirty-Seven' is an amazing season opener that leaves one anxiously awaiting the rest of the season. 'Grilled' provides a level of tension and excitement so high it leaves one wondering how the rest of the season will follow. While it does level out excitement-wise from there each episode is amazingly well crafted and dramatic from beginning to end. Other stand out episodes for me this season were '4 Days Out' and 'Mandala'. ABQ is also an incredibly well done season finale that leaves things in total chaos and wide open for the third season. Truly though, every episode stands out as excellently entertaining television making.    Amazon has listed the Special Features for this set above and there are more than enough of them to make this set well worth the money for the in depth special features alone. I do want to point out that all the same features are available on the Blu-Ray release as the DVD but the Blu-Ray set will include an exclusive special feature, The Writer's Lab- An Interactive Guide to the Elements of an Episode.    This set provides an astounding amount of in depth special features for fans as well as the 13 amazing second season episodes, unlike the first season set which on account of the writer's strike only had seven. It's all at an affordable price and it's shows like this that I feel are most worth owning on DVD or Blu-ray for repeat viewings because they are truly not only entertaining but because they are so layered you see new things each time you rewatch an episode. I highly recommend this set to any fan of well made television drama and obviously to fans of this amazing series. Thanks for your time.
0316154687|3.0|I had seen \\"When You Are Engulfed In Flames\\" by David Sedaris on numerous previous trips to the book store. It's the cover that caught my eye each time - an impressionist human skull with a smoldering hand-rolled cigarette clenched in its teeth. (Little did I know till later that this was a Van Gogh painting) Knowing nothing of the author, or the subject matter, I nonetheless held the hardcover volume in my hands willing to try it on the basis of the cover art alone. Perhaps it was the recession, or something that came along to divert my attention, I always returned it to the shelf and moved on.<br /><br />Until this summer, that is. It's a bit of a tradition of mine when at the shore to stop in a boardwalk or near-the-beach book store and pick up some summer reading for those cool ocean breeze evenings. And at such an occasion, there again was the skull, beckoning me closer. By this time the transition to paperback had happened, so the financial stars aligned for me to actually purchase it.<br /><br />I tell you this to drive home what my thoughts were when I started reading. I had no idea that David Sedaris was already an author of some renown, or that his pieces appear in the New Yorker, or that he appeared regularly on National Public Radio. I'm not sure what I expected, maybe something deeply dark and sinister. It was a blank canvas. But of course what I discovered is the slightly off-beat and different world of Mr. Sedaris.<br /><br />After reading the book as I try to rationalize Mr. Sadaris, what I've arrived at is that he is sort of a very gay version of Woody Allen. And I do mean very gay, as Mr. Sedaris's homosexuality is front and center in many of the pieces. But the neurosis and borderline narcissism of Mr. Allen is right there as well. Imagine a very different take on a movie scene with Mr. Allen and Diane Keaton - they are walking through the streets of New York, as Mr. Allen unburdens himself to Ms. Keaton:<br /><br />WA: So then he invited me into his apartment - I was terrified.<br />DK: So, what happened next?<br />WA: Well we sat down and had a drink, and then he asked me if I'd like him to give me a shotgun.<br />DK: A shotgun? You mean when he blows pot smoke into your mouth?<br />WA: Well yeh, he had to explain that. At first I thought he was suggesting we drive out to some backwoods place in New Jersey. I was so embarrassed...<br /><br />A lot of \\"When You Are Engulfed In Flames\\" reads like this, and these are the stories that mostly lay limp on the page. Recountings of various family and school/work situations, some punctuated with occasional funny punch-lines that ultimately have the feel of dinner conversations that have gone on a bit too long. So many of these pieces seem to have been written in a style where the intent is for them to be spoken aloud to an audience, rather than as literary works in their own right.<br /><br />But not everything falls into this category. There are moments of true inspired greatness, and it seems these heights are attained when Mr. Sedaris lets go the template of the talk-show speaker, and lets his mind wander. By far the best piece to illustrate this is \\"Memento Mori\\", which I've reread several times and still laugh as hard as the first time. Here, a human skeleton that hangs in his home (a bizarre birthday request from his partner) begins to speak to him, in a twisted sort of modern retelling of the Poe's Tell Tale Heart. It is an exceptional piece, truly warped and twisted in a Monty Python-esque sort of way, and demonstrates the potential that Mr. Sedaris has to take things to a truly different level. There are several other very good pieces as well - \\"Town & Country\\", and \\"Aerial\\" to name a couple.<br /><br />Which brings me back to Woody Allen.<br /><br />Most of Mr. Allen's work is not exceptional. In many ways, he makes the same movie over and over again, each just a slightly different neurotic take on relationships. But we collectively forgive Mr. Allen these misfires, because he has an ability to occasionally envision something really unique, and takes us to a cinematically special place with films that forever remain with us. We wait for these, and relish them when they arrive. A short list I readily think of would include \\"The Purple Rose of Cairo\\", \\"Radio Days\\", and \\"Zelig\\". This is not Woody Allen the neurotic, but the cracked-smile satirical genius who can take us all with him to delight in his special world.<br /><br />I'd like to see Mr. Sedaris take this step. He's clearly capable of it. Why should his books just be a collection of bits and pieces targeted to live audiences? Let's see a coherent piece that makes sense as a novel, where he can just let go with his quirky and truly funny worldview, and leave the stereotypical baggage at home. It would be a pleasure to read, if it happens.<br /><br />For now, three stars seems to suffice for this effort. There were great moments, but they were packed between a lot of table conversation that was pretty much forgettable.y unique, and takes us to a cinematically special place with films that forever remain with us.

0425218929|3.0|After the bloated and ridiculous 'Cause of Death', it seems like Cornwell is taking a back-to-basics approach with her latest Scarpetta novel. When a body is discovered covered in pox-like pustles, Scarpetta and the FBI are faced with the prospect of an outbreak of smallpox. But since smallpox has been eradicated from the population, the only answer seems to be \\"unnatural exposure\\", a person deliberately infecting others with the deadly disease. But who, and for what ends?    It's pleasing to see that even Cornwell realised that 'Cause of Death' was a bridge too far, and 'Unnatural Exposure' represents a clear pullback from the excesses of that book. The baffling FBI and computer terminology is kept to a minimum, and Scarpetta isn't quite as big a know-it-all (although she still gets plenty of opportunity to attack some more stereotypically sexist male characters). And instead of taking on nuclear-hijacking terrorists, investigating a potential disease outbreak is exactly the sort of thing an M.E. seconded to the FBI would be involved in. In all, it's a leaner and more focussed book, much more in line with Cornwell's earlier works. That should be pleasing for all Scarpetta fans who felt the series was going downhill.    Still, it's clear the series is not quite what it was. There is a real lack of subtelty in Cornwell's characterisation, particularly the men. Apart from love-interest Wesley, every male character is either weak and in need of mothering (Wingo, Pleasants, Marino to an extent) or a sexist oaf (pretty much everyone else). That running joke about mispronouncing the heroine's name is wearing very thin. SCAR-PETTA; it's pronounced how it looks, how could anyone have a problem with it? And the ending is a bit abrupt and unsatisfying....holding a grudge for so long would provoke you to cause an outbreak??    That said, 'Unnatural Exposure' is a clear step up from its predecessor, and a tentative step toward getting the series back to its roots. Not perfect,and not as good as her first books, but a comeback of sorts.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|a nice little slice of life movie. greg mottola tells his story like a cherished and vivid memory (which is what it actually is) and standout performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart make the film worth while. the laughs are human and honest and the drama is quietly affecting. its not perfect, but its a good coming of age story.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is the Devil Barber of Fleet Street - he cuts and slashes throats with blood shooting out like fountains at the Bellagio.  The movie is dark, set in Victorian London, and makeup frames the characters as ghoulish.<br /><br />Then there is the music - no song stands out and it seems like opera - just singing the lines that should be spoken.  A horror movie musical - I guess that is a joke in itself.<br /><br />The story is dark and too long.  Sweeney was put in prison by a judge who had fallen in love with Sweeney's wife.  He took Sweeney's wife and baby daughter as prisoners in the his home.  After many years, Sweeney returns to London to take revenge on the judge and find his wife and daughter.<br /><br />He goes to the pie shop owned by Mrs. Lovett who only wants to please Sweeney.  His old barber razors were hidden in the floorboards.  They are sharp and shiny.<br /><br />Sweeney plans on killing the judge in the barber chair by slitting his throat.  The first time he gets the judge in the chair, he is interrupted and the judge leaves alive.<br /><br />Soon Sweeney develops a barber chair that flips the dead clients down a chute that leads to Mrs. Lovett's oven.  She cooks the people Sweeney kills into tasty meat pies.<br /><br />Sweeney is shown slitting throats - one after another and then pushing the chair's lever and they slide down to the basement - bloody and dead.  All this while music plays, and hard to understand singing is flowing through the scenes.<br /><br />The humor is dark - tongue in cheek - and tiresome.  The blood is spurting and the story is depressing.  All I came away with was relief the movie was over and slightly nauseated from all the neck cutting and blood spurting.<br /><br />Tim Burton is the Director - he has done better work.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I got this because I'm a fan of Matthew Macfayden. His acting was excellent and so was Claire Foy. I watched the entire series in 2 days, I couldn't stop watching. The story is classic and this version is a great one. I highly recommend it to those who are fans of Matthew Macfayden and Charles Dickens. Too wonderful to miss.
0312383436|5.0|I've read most of Wickham's other novels and so was prepared for a rather un-conclusive and not exactly happy ending and so was very pleasantly surprised at the ending of this novel. She proves that she can pull of a novel that doesn't shy away from the hard parts of life, deals with really complex and hard to solve problems, and still leaves nearly everything tied up at the end. I particularly enjoyed the dealings between Richard and his wife and him dealing with his past and what he wants for in the future. A must read for Wickham fans who might enjoy a little more settled ending then she usually leaves us with.
0385342020|4.0|When I first heard that Sophie Kinsella's new book had a supernatural slant I was disappointed and very nervous. Once I actually started the story though I was immediately surprised at how realistic (well as realistic as a ghost story can be) she writes a ghost into a modern day story. Like all Kinsella novels there's a little \\"mystery\\" and a bad guy that needs to be exposed and as always she makes it a great fun story. I really enjoyed the story, but I agree with others who point out that it's not as good as some of her previous works.

0312944926|1.0|The good thing about Dan Brown is that he's a good storyteller. The bad one, that he's an awful writer. His books look very much like a Sunday evening gangster movie which you forget about once you exit the theatre: car chases, evil and powerful (and rich!) enemies, handsome innocent couple who bounce into each other by accident, defeat the enemy with their intelligence as their only weapon, and end up falling in love and solving the crime... The farthest Brown goes with descriptions is with cliché filled adjectives such as \\"Swiss mountains filled with Edelweiss flowers\\" or \\"London and its double decker buses\\"; and dialogues don't improve much either, most of them being very much in the way of \\"We need to save my father / You mean we have to save your father? / Yes, it is very important for us to save my father. Will you help me? / Of course I will help you save your father. / Thanks for helping me save my father.\\" And so on...  But there's something Brown is very good at: Riddles. Making the plot move forward thanks to magical mysterious symbols appearing from nowhere has become his personal trademark of success. And it sure makes the reading enjoyable. The Da Vinci Code, for example, had many geographical and historical mistakes, but they were eclipsed by the riddles.   The problem with Digital Fortress is that it doesn't have a single riddle to solve, so all we are left with is Dan Brown's flat dialogue lines and a flatter Wikipedia-copy-pasted description of how the National Security Agency works. But Brown tries to make up for the missing mysteries by jamming the book with a fast paced action taking place in Spain, and that's where he totally crashes. He had already proven how a poor documented writer he is, but here he tries to fill-up 400 pages with cultural data about a foreign country, and then we can only expect for the worse: The whole book is filled with dialogues in Spanish that have grammatical and cultural typos in every single line; furthermore, hemakes up the description of Spanish daily life, and even of the monuments involved in the plot, even mixing up names!, thus depicting Spain as a third world primitive barren land with no telephone lines, punk gangs everywhere, and chaos amidst, resembling it more like Afghanistan than to the modern country it is.   My recommendation: Go for the Sunday movie. Be it a gangsters' one or not. You wont' find your intelligence being insulted and you'll save yourself some money.
0385342020|3.0|I couldn't resist this book -- mystery, ghost story, chick lit all in one!  However, upon reading the first twenty pages, I knew this wasn't going to be like Kinsella's other books.  First off, I didn't feel as attached to Lara as I did with Kinsella's other characters.  For instance, Becky Bloomwood in the Shopoholic series is a bit of a nut, but still every bit as lovable.  Lara pales in comparison, she comes off as a watered down version -- a bit nutty, obsessive, but bland.  I guess if you didn't know what Kinsella was capable of, it wouldn't be as noticeable.  There were moments where the silliness overshadowed the plot and I wanted to ask, really??    The overall mystery was cute and clever, if not a bit cliched.  Sadie is pretty much the most memorable 3-dimensional character, ironic as she's a ghost.  I wish Kinsella did a better job characterizing the two men in the novel, because they really came out like cookie cutter stereotypes.  I know this book's more along the lines of a mystery/ghost story, but if you're going to throw in a heated romance, especially in chick lit, the guy's really got to have more to offer than an Aston Martin and thick brows (basically, Ed's an American Luke Brandon, with less personality, if that's possible)!      Also, I felt the book could have used a bit of editing.  It's 450 pages, which goes beyond the lines of a light, easy read.  There was definitely drag in the beginning and in the middle, and the ending was way too predictable.  I didn't feel rewarded for actually finishing the book.  I guess I was a bit disappointed with the quality of this book in comparison with Kinsella's other works, it just seemed to rehash characters and throw them into a lukewarm plot for 200 pages too many.  I would suggest this book only to someone who wants a light read but doesn't mind wading through the silly parts and the dragging parts of the novel.  Fans of Kinsella's previous works may be disappointed with the lack of editing and stock characters in this book.

0307455378|3.0|After having read La Sombra del Viento I decided to read  El Juego del Angel.  I felt  it was a little bit the continuation of the first book.  It was nicely written but it did not keep up the intrigue and the mystery of the first one.  I think it was nice to read it because he writts very nice Spanish but La Sombra del Viento is definetely the book I would recomend more!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney's absence from the music scene has been well chronicled by others and there's no need to revisit all of that gossip here.  The question is whether I Look To You makes for a great listening experience.     And the answer is most certainly YES!    Back with strong vocals, albeit in a more limited range, Whitney's newest album is a new sound but still an enjoyable listen.  Huskier and more gravelly than we remember, her voice is still The Voice and we should rejoice in a new era rather than mourn the passing of the past.    Its tempting to read more into her lyrics than perhaps she intended, but thats what great music allows for.      When she sings the title cut \\"I Look to You\\" by R. Kelly, which some have called churchy and schmaltzy, I wonder who she is really singing to...God?  Perhaps...but maybe its really intended for her daughter whom she has credited with bringing her strength during her time away.  I know I looked to mine as I conquered a period of depression and substance abuse in my life. \\"Who on earth can I turn to?  I look to you...\\".  Thank you Bobbi Christina!    On the track \\"Like I Never Left\\" with Akon we might think she is speaking to a former lover, but I wonder:  is she really talking to Clive Davis?  Her snubs of him were famous in the early 2000s and she eventually turned away from his guiding hand. Her last studio album, Just Whitney, was produced not by Clive but by Bobby Brown.  And it was a dismal disappointment.  Is Clive's girl back, and back on top?  Lets hope so.    I have read most of the reviews of this album on here and in the print and online media and the thing that strikes me is how each track is a favorite of different writers, which speaks to the consistent strength of the entire album.  Now that is classic Whitney.    I love this album, not because it soars like her previous albums but because it soars in new ways, with a new found emotional commitment to the lyric and the melody.  Music we will remember, for sure!
B001FB55H6|5.0|Great movie, even better than the theatrical version. Also has better special features than the standard 2 disc edition (Which is what we are limited to in Australia).  Note: Disc is Region Free so will work on any Blu-Ray player in any country!  Unfortunately though the Digital Copy Disc is only licenced to the US & Canada so it won't work elsewhere.
B0020TS5JM|2.0|As has been reported elsewhere, the blu-ray version of this entertaining and well-done mash-up of fantasy and scifi, Beowulf and Predator-like narratives, has been irresponsibly and irreparably ruined in the transfer offered by Alliance of Canada.  Similar to what Alliance did with Se7en, they have cropped the film's original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 down to 1.78:1!  Not sure what \\"genius\\" was behind this decision, but for anyone wanting to see this film in blu-ray, hope the currently financially-challenged Weinstein Group are one day able to offer this film in the US with the transfer it deserves!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|IT AMAZES ME HOW PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING HER TO SOUND LIKE SHE DID 15 YEARS AGO...WTF?? ARE U SERIOUS?? AFTER ALL THE THINGS SHES ENDURED OVER THE LAST DECADE...? ARE U REALLY SERIOUS? COME ON U GUYS, GET REAL...I'M A DIE HARD WHITNEY FAN, AND EVEN I DIDNT EXPECT THAT!! IDIOTS..JUST IDIOTS. THIS ALBUM DESERVES TO BE JUDGED BASED ON WHERE SHE IS TODAY, AND WHERE SHES BEEN. AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, BASED OFF OFF WHERE SHES BEEN, I THINK SHE SOUNDS DAMN GOOD! THE SONGS WERE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN FOR AN ICON. SHES HITTING NOTES ON SOME OF THESE SONGS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTABLY ABSENT FOR OVER 10 YEARS!! ITS A GOOD EFFORT ON WHITNEY'S BEHALF. AND SHE DESERVES ALL THE HAPPINESS AND SUCCESS THAT SHE CANT JUST HOLD. SHES GOT HER LIFE BACK ON TRACK, AND SHES STILL HERE. SOMETHING MUST BE SAID FOR THAT. I WILL DEFINITELY SAY, NO HER VOICE ISNT WHAT IT ONCE WAS, BUT I THINK EVERYONE(EVEN THE HATERS) WILL AGREE WHEN I SAY THIS....THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT WHITNEY'S VOICE THAT NO ONE CAN EVER TOUCH!! AND YES WHITNEY....I LOVE YOU \\"LIKE YOU NEVER LEFT\\" BABY.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|A friend of mine, from the Carribean, had this album playing in the background at a party.  All of us were like, \\"Who the hell is this amazing, creative singer???\\"  I'm so glad I found this, as I love the entire album, and you won't find anything in the early 2000's as fresh and creative as this.  If you're thinking you might get this out of curiosity, DO IT!  I promise, you will not be disappointed.  This is particularly a good driving album, as it blends so many genres and tempos that you end up tapping your feet and singing along (even if you don't know what the lyrics mean)!  \\"Me Gustas Tu\\" is one of my favorite songs of all time, and I never get tired of listening to it... It's so darn catchy!    What a talent.

B00004Y6NX|5.0|By the time this album came out(Dire straits 3rd)Mark Knopfler's brother David had left the band. The resulting trio created in my opinion one of the best rock albums of the 70's. 30 years later and I still listen to this album on a regular basis. By the way, check out some of Knopfler's recent work. His Shangri-la LP is great.
B0012GMY64|5.0|This CD was perfect and we received it exactly as Amazon said we would. This is a classic Andy Williams CD that was my Mother in Laws favorite. Thanks for making her special day great!
B00000K0EA|3.0|A flat pre-credit sequence and by-the-numbers climax prevent &#34;Tomorrow Never Dies&#34; (1997) from matching the overall excellence of &#34;GoldenEye.&#34; What remains is mostly splendid — with Pierce Brosnan as an elegant yet refreshingly hard-edged James Bond. Jonathan Pryce's multimedia villainy and Michelle Yeoh's energetic presence help tremendously. However, the 007 producers made a big mistake replacing k.d. lang's dynamic theme song with Sheryl Crow's weak &#34;official&#34; version in the opening credits.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney Houston is back ladies and gentleman. She does keep cool and mellow on this new album, which is different. Her style has changed with her vocals strengths. But it's great to hear her bang tracks again. This is a must have collection for all Whitney Houston fans, and fans of R&B.     Favorite tracks:    Million Dollar Baby: Great way to start off! It has that old school, R&B/Funk/Disco feel, with a new twist. You can really hear Alicia Keys influence on this track. This is a feel good love song for all the ladies in love.    Call You Tonight. This song is a great R&B smooth track. Whitney is smooth and cool on this track. Playing with her vocal range, but keeping it under control. Very catchy song. Another feel good jam.    Like I Never Left. This song has Akon all over it, remixed for Whitney. Whitney sounds like she had fun on this track. Love how she sounds playful with her vocals towards the end of the record, which is a joy to hear.    I Didn't know my own strength. This song is moving. Beautiful and awe inspiring lyrics. Whitney sings from her heart, she lives this song. She is this song. She shares her up and downs with us on this song. Very brave and strong of her to do. Classic Whitney ballad.    Worth it. Another feel good love jam. She gives a shout out to all the lovers out there young and old. It's a positive upbeat jam that's fun to listen to.    And Salute....This song is the new Whitney. This is a song in the style of Mary J Blige...Urban R&b soul with a message of being a strong independent woman after love went wrong. A song of survival after a heartbreak. You know she was thinking of Bobby when she was making this record.    Whitney Houston is finally back with new material that I appreciate and enjoy. An excellent mix of upbeat tempos and powerful and moving ballads. A must have in your collection.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I am amazed at how generous the reviews have been with this release. I know there are huge Whitney fans out there who have been waiting for this release, but in all honesty I can only call this cd average. Whitney once possessed one of the greatest voices of the past 20 years, and reigned supreme for many years, so this was a let down in many ways. I know the voice has changed, the range and power have diminished, but her voice is still a fine instrument. She used is wisely with the material given to her. My problem is exactly with that...the music. With someone as dynamic as she is (was), I would expect top notch songwriters who know how to write for classic acts, to offer better material than this. Whitney is a mature woman, and needs more songs to reflect that. Many of the songs could have gone to Jennifer Hudson, a revamped Destinys Child, or any of the younger Divas out there. Although the music is not terrible, it is not up to par Whitney Houston music. There was nothing that really tugged at the heatstrings, or showcased a singer who has been around the block and back. Hopefully the next release will focus on making real music for this supertalent, and not trying to compete with teenagers and young adults.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|After all the speculation on the contents of \\"I Look To You\\" I was blown away when I heard it all the way through. There is not a bad cut on this release. She sounds real and strong and vulnerable - the sign of a true interpreter of song. The cd speaks for itself and will be considered one of her best if not the best. Like she never left....#1 album, #1 single dance, at the top #1. You did it!
B000002U82|5.0|It's a classic for a reason.  What Sgt. Pepper did for pop music, Dark Side of the Moon does for rock.  It's conceptual, brilliant and timeless.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|By far the best album of this year... Whitney Houston has returned to her throne and there is no stopping her. hate it or love, the queen of the night is taking music back and making it something to enjoy.... i have fallen in love with great sounds of soul all over again... Whitney houston is hands down the greatest female singer to ever live. with clive by her side, i look to you gives the fans just what they wanted. a cool refreshing glass of soul in the land of bubble gum sounds.... thank you so much for your gift Whitney.... the best is yet to come, but it keeps on getting better....<br /><br />There is something about these songs that i can't take the cd off of repeat... this is what the doctor ordered..... Whitney... we love you!!!!!!<br /><br />2009 is your year Nippy!!!!!!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This was recommended to me as an adult game, but my 7 year old daughter loves it and she's pretty good too. It keeps everyones attention and we have a great time playing.    The one issue would be the borders and ease that the tabs can get bent or begin to peel.
B0000640VO|5.0|I first saw this on an international flight, probably the year it came out.  I rented it for my family when I got home.  Seven years later I bought it on amazon after first looking thru assorted blockbuster previously viewed and not finding it.  Thanks amazon, for having this available and I got two other french films on the same purchase.  Supposidly this film did not receive a French award because it was too \\"American\\".  Well, they can keep their awards along with their perfume and I will keep Amelie forever.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|Mad men is the best written TV show in a long while.  the costumes and the sets are fantastic, the attention to detail is not to be believed.  The actors are great.  if you love the era and love good writing, then this is the show for you
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Serenity is a good movie.  It is better than the Firefly series.  Enjoy it. :)
B00005JLD4|5.0|Based in 1931, the movie Rabbit-Proof Fence is about half-cast children being taken from their Aboriginal mothers and to a place called Moore River. Here they will be brought up by whites and supposedly this is to save them from themselves. Three girls escape shortly after arriving to Moore River and they travel through the Australian terrain to get back home to their mothers while a tracker and other hired men are given the task of finding them and bringing them back to Moore River. Along the way back home to Jigalong, they run into several people who are willing to help them and provide them a helping hand, such as giving them food and providing them with shelter to rest for a short period before they head back out and continue their journey. Eventually, they reach the rabbit-proof fence, where they will follow it all the way back to Jigalong.    The movie relates to World Religions because it tells of how difficult it can be for someone who is different to survive. It shows that not everyone is treated the same just because of their culture and how they are raised and that there are people out there that are trying to get them to convert to living like them. These children were taught that their ways were inferior and others tried to bring them away from their culture and the things they were taught. It proves that with determination someone can escape the strife that is being thrown at them and can get to a place where they belong and where they can continue to be happy. Another thing that relates to World Religions is the characters in the movie were indigenous to their land and they lived away from the places that were industrialized and they survived on their own without needing the help of industry.
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I love this collection because it has all the movies including the most recent from maybe 2007? The movies themselves have excellent clarity and quality. Really enjoy this collection!

1906355630|4.0|Adrian Dayton's book, \\"Social Media for Lawyers: Twitter Edition,\\" is a useful, practical guide lawyers who want to get the most from Twitter. Whether you are an avid Twitter user like myself, or a newbie or even just curious, you'll get something useful out of this book. And don't let the \\"lawyer\\" in the title trick you into thinking the book is long winded and boring. On the contrary, Mr. Dayton writes in a fluid, conversational style, making it a quick and easy read.    Social media outlets such as Twitter are becoming more and more important for communication, and business/client development. Such outlets are not without their pitfalls, so let \\"Social Media for Lawyers: Twitter Edition\\" be your guide.
0307460444|5.0|Beautiful book with lots of yummy cupcake recipes. I Just made the Banana Pecan cupcakes with Caramel Buttercream frosting for my twins birthdays.  They were a BIG hit!  Can't wait to try them all!  Should mention, I just upgraded my gym membership!
0307588335|4.0|Former Lehman convertible bond trader Lawrence McDonald has penned the story of Lehman Brother's spiral into bankruptcy. This book is highly readable and does a great job of explaining some very difficult concepts (CDOs and the other derivatives that caused Lehman to fail for instance) in a non-tchnical way that non-finance experts can understand.<br /><br />The story is also the tale of how our economy got into the mess it is in now, for Lehman Brothers was but one of the firms that made the mistake of not properly controlling their risks. It is the tale of how some senior managers in the firm wanted growth at all costs and were unwilling to listen to anyone who raised concerns that the firm was grossly over leveraged.<br /><br />As one of the people who worked at Lehman when it fell, I can absolutely feel the authors pain at seeing a firm he truly liked working at sink into the abyss. Like Mr. McDonald, I look back at Lehman's collapse not with anger, but with profound sadness. The firm was a great place to work, was filled with some truly wonderful people, and is missed by all of us who worked there.

0385340575|5.0|Lee Child is the greatest!  I am a \\"Reacher Creature\\" and have read all of his books.  Amazon made it super-easy to get the latest book, with no trouble...just took me one click!    I highly recommend Child's books.  There has been talk of making at least one of his books into a movie, but I can't think of an actor that could play Jack Reacher...he is just the coolest protagonist EVER!  My imagination makes him better than any real-life actor could be.  One of the best scenes, from BAD LUCK & TROUBLE, was just perfect:  Jack and three of his ex-Army pals walking down the Strip in Las Vegas, with a guy coming up behind to kill them all.  Reacher saved them all, of course!  So fine!    Cathy Haney
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This film is faithful to Jane Austen's book, & reproduces the sad, autumn feel of the work. Amanda Root IS Anne Eliot, & is allowed to develop the part in a moving way. Captain Wentworth, Ciaran Hinds is a handsome foil, Corin Redgrave a perfectly aweful, stupid Sir Walter Eliot. The casting is excellent, my only quibble being Mr Eliot, the cad of the piece, being too handsome & mild. Admiral Croft & Mrs Croft are believably a happy couple, & Elizabeth Eliot is superbly catty & selfish. The friction between Charles Musgrove & his wife, Mary is nicely spelt out. For Jane Austen fans, this is a must! You will not have to endure the plot being subverted or chopped about, & my favourite scene, where Captain Wentworth overhears Anne Eliot talking with Captain Harwill, is there in full. Highly recommended.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|I read this book as a kid, and loved it.  However after reading this version I realized that I had read a shortened version.  I'm so glad I took the time to re-read such a wonderful book.  The longer version is definitely better.    This should be required reading for junior high students as there are many life lessons contained in this terrific story.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I had never even heard of Sons of Anarchy until a person at work - who has similar tastes in TV - recommended it to me.  I watched a promo trailer on YouTube and then ordered the DVDs sight unseen.  The gamble payed off big time. This show is amazing. Created by Kurt Sutter, who was an executive producer on the also amazing The Shield, this is a story about an outlaw Motorcycle Club in California. Just like The Shield, this show gets more and more complex as it goes along, and I can't wait to see just how much more it can get.  All the characters, despite most being on the wrong side of the law, are all likeable, and just as complex as the show itself.  My favourite characters in this first season are Tig and Opie, but they all have their redeeming qualities.  Opie is a club member just released from prison, and is trying to balance his family life, with the club, even as he is trying to pull away from that part of his life.  Tig is a bit of a psychopath, and Kim Coates plays this side of him well. He has got crazy eyes. But he also has a funny side, and does get to reveal that he has a heart as well. But mostly he is crazy, and that is whats so great about him.  The season ends in such a way that will make you desperate to watch the next one, while still able to give closure to some of the story.  This show is the worthy successor to fill the void left by The Shield.  The special features on the DVD are interesting, entertaining, and informative.   The Making of featurette has interviews with cast and crew, and reveals what the scar on Gemmas chest is all about. (I was wondering that all season). You even get Charlie Hunman speaking in his English accent, and even though I knew he was English, after just watching him as Jax for 13 episodes, it was a little bit weird.  The Ink, and The Bikes both talk about designing the tattoos that they wear, and customizing their individual bikes, which the actor apparently had a hand in.  Anarchy on the set is the gag reel, which is actually pretty funny.  There's also commentaries on select episodes and deleted scenes to round out the set.    [...]

B00005QGAX|5.0|Michael Jackson had more talent in his pinky finger than most \\"celebrities\\" have or ever will have; and albums like \\"Bad\\" prove it. Michael absolutely glows on this CD and the bonus tracks are a treat I'll enjoy listening to over and over again! This is a fine CD for any MJ fan; and it's also a great starter CD for anyone just getting into the captivating artistry of Michael Jackson.<br /><br />The album starts with Michael doing more than his best on the title song, \\"Bad.\\" The beat is great for dancing and he does this one up right without ever letting go of a single superfluous note! The layers of vocals enhance the song and I love that organ, too. The percussion is used to great advantage and overall \\"Bad\\" is a stunner of an opening number. \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\" is also very strong; Michael delivers this with lots of positive energy; it's numbers like this that grab you by the throat and never let go until the very last second of the song! It's all worth it, too; Michael's genius is so apparent on CDs like this one. \\"Speed Demon\\" has some mighty good musical effects as Michael sings this very well; and I also like \\"Liberian Girl\\" which Michael performs most passionately. \\"Liberian Girl\\" shines brighter than silver and gold combined when Michael does it; and the music fits perfectly with Michael's vocals.<br /><br />\\"Another Part of Me\\" is a terrific Michael Jackson tune that I loved the very first time I ever heard it; this music is all THAT good. The beat is strong and great for dancing practically wherever you are; and Michael's excellent diction enhances this number all the more. \\"Man in the Mirror\\" is a particularly beautiful song; Michael struck gold yet again with this one--and just one listen will tell you why! Michael also handles complex tempo and key changes like the pro he was and still remains; I'm very impressed.<br /><br />\\"I Just Can't Stop Loving You\\" is quite memorable; Michael and Siedah Garrett sing this to perfection--and beyond! The radio edit of \\"Smooth Criminal\\" is strong with an awesome beat that really makes me sit up and take notice; it's flawless music indeed. \\"Leave Me Alone\\" certainly shows Michael's creativity as a fine recording artist, too; and that's grand.<br /><br />In addition, the bonus interviews with Quincy Jones give us good insight about this album; I enjoyed hearing Quincy talk about Michael, this music, the music video \\"Man in the Mirror\\" and more. \\"Todo Mi Amor Eres Tu (I Just Can't Stop Loving You)\\" showcases the beautiful Spanish version of this ballad; and \\"Fly Away\\" is absolutely awesome. The bonus tracks are a great way to end this remastered album; I love it!<br /><br />Michael Jackson may no longer be with us but, WOW, how he lives on through his music. I doubt that we'll ever see another entertainer quite like him; he was so very, very special. If you want a terrific Michael Jackson album, this would be a great choice.inal\\" is strong with an awesome beat that really makes me sit up and take notice; it's flawless music indeed. \\"Leave Me Alone\\" certainly shows Michael's creativity as a fine recording artist, too; and that's grand.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|After many years of a noticeable silence (both in voice and presence) the Whitney Houston America loved and admired has reemerged. The material is pure Whitney-inspired heart, soul, rhythm, and depth of matter. Folks, I can't get some of these tunes out of my head... most notably, \\"Million Dollar Bill.\\"     It's her genuinely captivating voice, with such inflection, range, and now - maturity - that has drawn me back into the spellbound trance only Whitney's gift of song can provide. No, this album isn't \\"The Bodyguard\\" soundtrack revisited as other reviewers have mentioned, but then again, Ms. Houston's not 30 years old anymore either. She's matured, and better than ever.     And let's not neglect the fact that she's seen a lot of misfortune in her life recently, and this album just goes to show how this remarkable woman has withstood adversity and is still able to bless the world with her magnificent, heaven-sent gift of song.
B00014TJ7K|5.0|This remastered recording of George Harrison's Cloud Nine is one of the best in my collection. George is in excellent form here and these numbers stayed in my mind ever since I first heard them. I am impressed with George's creativity; and he worked wonders on this album with some of his peers including Elton John, Eric Clapton and former Beatle band mate Ringo Starr. The quality of the sound on this CD is, as you would expect, nothing short of excellent and I like that they used that cover art.<br /><br />The CD starts with Harrison performing the title track, \\"Cloud Nine.\\" He sounds great and the music fits perfectly with his vocals. The percussion, electric guitar and drums all connect to make up a good deal of the musical arrangement and it all holds its own very well. \\"That's What It Takes\\" is another striking number; I like the way George plays with key modulations to make this quite strong. George delivers this without ever letting go of a superfluous note and that's pretty impressive. The drums, electric guitar and more make for some mighty fine music as George sings the lyrics; I love it!<br /><br />\\"Fish on the Sand\\" speeds up the tempo a bit for a change of pace that lacks nothing--this music is all THAT good. \\"Just For Today\\" is a touching ballad that George Harrison delivers faultlessly; as some have noted it is songs like this that prove George could write a melancholy tune that is obviously on the same level or better than The Beatles' \\"Yesterday.\\" \\"This Is Love\\" has a great flavor to it and it was always one of my very favorite songs on this album; and I really like \\"When We Was Fab.\\" \\"When We Was Fab\\" has an excellent arrangement that makes it powerful and quite poignant. \\"When We Was Fab\\" is clearly one of the best tunes George Harrison ever turned out after he left The Beatles; and just one listen proves it. \\"Devil's Radio\\" has George outdoing even himself as he sings this to perfection--and beyond! \\"Devil's Radio\\" is yet another gem on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Someplace Else\\" lets George sing a most passionate song; the melancholy ache that permeates this song makes it moving and in its own way very beautiful. The music that plays fits perfectly with George's vocals; but the others let George's singing remain squarely in the spotlight which is right where he'll always belong. The backup singing enhances the song--not that George Harrison ever really needed backup but they do sound pretty good anyway. \\"Wreck of the Hesperus\\" has a rockin' feel to it that I enjoy every time I hear this number; and \\"Breath Away From Heaven\\" uses the percussion, drums and more to great advantage as George sings wonderfully.<br /><br />\\"Got My Mind Set on You\\" is an excellent number all around; this really made the airwaves sizzle when it was released back in the day! There's also \\"Shanghai Surprise\\" which was written for a movie with Sean Penn and Madonna that didn't play too long in movie theaters; and the CD ends very well with George Harrison performing \\"Zig Zag.\\" \\"Zig Zag\\" has a great feel to it and it's rather catchy, too. \\"Zig Zag\\" is a terrific way to end this CD.<br /><br />George Harrison lives on through his music; and this remastered CD is a must for his fans.

0385342020|5.0|I am not a huge fan of the shopaholic series. I did enjoy \\"Remember Me\\" and \\"Can you keep a Secret\\"  \\"Twenties Girl\\" is so much better. The plot may appear trite, however, the story was very well written. It is unusual for chick-lit to feature two women as the leading characters. Lara is the only person who can see her great-aunt who is a ghost. She appears to Lara at her funeral and insists that Lara find her necklace, so that she can rest in peace. What happens is a whirlwind adventure for both women. Parts of the book were so funny I laughed out-loud. Slowly you begin to feel the affection both women come to have for each other. There is a love-interest for Lara as well. While Ed is not the central part of story, he adds a nice touch to the book. He was my favorite of all of Sophie Kinsella's male characters, a nice bonus. Like the advertisement for \\"Ghost\\" years ago that tells you that you \\"will believe\\", I did. For that reason the ending was very touching. This book is highly recommended, even for those that are not a fan of chick-lit.

B000UPSKO8|5.0|I have a large opera collection and many of the opera gala concerts are enjoyed but aren't up to the caliber of singing in this terrific concert.  First of all, it's a hit parade of arias and duets - you'll love all the selections chosen.  The performance of all four is just the best in opera today; the men were in top voice, (Vargas best I've heard him in awhile) and the women spectacular!  The other concert that I like as much as this is the one from Berlin with Domingo, Villazon, and Netrebko.  That one is worth having just to hear and see Rolando who will not be singing until he recovers and rehabs from vocal surgery.  Treat yourself and your friends to this video - makes a great gift too - it is highly recommended!!  Four of the best singers in the opera world today in one great concert!

B002BFBAWO|4.0|\\"Adventureland\\" written and directed by Greg Mottola<br /><br />1987, Pennsylvania; James Brennan (Jesse Eisenberg) has just graduated college and is ready to embark on his long awaited European tour before going on to grad school in New York in the fall. Unfortunately James' father has been transferred into a much lower paying position which results in the summer trip being canceled and his ability to attend grad school is in question also. James hasn't reached the bottom yet however as he has to get a summer job and with his lack of experience the only thing currently available is a position as a game operator at the local amusement park Adventureland with his former best friend Frigo. The job is less than satisfactory but James does take interest in his co-worker Em (Kristen Stewart) so maybe the job won't be a complete waste of time...<br /><br />Adventureland was a great movie but isn't going to be for everyone. Adventureland wasn't a basic Rom/Com as it didn't employ the typical over the top slapstick comedy and instead relied on a slightly smarter brand of humor combined with some crude humor.<br /><br />The Good: Great performances from all the actors/actresses and the move was well cast. I thought Kristen Stewart's take on her character was great. The character is very flawed and Kristen nailed it. The same can be said for Jesse's portrayal of James. The time in which the story takes place was an interesting choice and worked well and also provided a great soundtrack. Loved the humor in this movie and that it didn't rely on trite slap stick or completely on crude humor.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: If you are a fan of any of the actors / actresses or Rom Com in general than give Adventureland a try.

B0000067L2|5.0|MAN!!--Why can't they make music like this now!<br />MAN!!--Why couldn't I have been born 15 or 20 yrs before when I was born,<br />so I could've really enjoyed this classic psychedelic rock album when it was current and,<br />dare I think it, maybe could've had the chance to see CREAM live and in person??---WOW!!<br /><br />At any rate, this was my introduction to that MEGALITH of late 60's classic rock history.<br />It was 1981, I was 17 when I first heard this on vinyl---It was a life-changing musical revelation!<br />I love every track on here and I thought they did a great job with the remastering.<br />Music was so atmospheric in the late 60's and early 70's, and goodness knows, a time<br />of much radical changes and substance. I love to get around people of my parents' generation<br />who were living life and doing their thing as the young people of this time, so I can hear<br />their stories and absorb the music that moved them and captured where they were coming from.<br />I can put this CD on and be transported by it, much like SGT. PEPPER, THE DOORS, HENDRIX, SLY<br />and others, and it's like a blueprint or photograph, only a sonic one, of a time, a generation,<br />an ethos, and a mighty freaky funky all-inclusive celebration that will rock on forever!!<br />DISRAELI GEARS is, was, and always will be...THE BOMB, BABY!!

0739385852|5.0|Weird and wonderful.  I listened to this one and it was one of those rare find where the author reads and it's magnificant.  It is also the first audiobook to make good use of music - the first time I didn't actually find it irritating.      The story... the story was weird and wonderful and I didn't want it to end.  I sort of felt like I was there with Michael and Mina and Skellig.  The people that surround Michael are kind and he's able to feel his grief very deeply.  The contrast between Michael and Mina and the friendship that grows between them is beautiful.    Naturally not everyone will love this book as much as I did.  But it's not a long story and it is available on audio book so I would recommend that you at least give it a chance.

0198534469|4.0|This is a great book that has earned my respect, but it is not for a beginner. It is intended for the crowd who already has some good mathematics background (at least the basic calculus levels and understanding of what imaginary numbers are).     Other than that the book is enlightening and entertaining. I learn something new everyday with this book, it is a great book to have as a teaching suppliment or as light reading. It allows one focus on concepts that may be hard to grasp in literature, but now more easy to grasp due to the visual representations this book contains.     I gave it 4 out 5 of because I wish to see more practical applications besides just theory (although the book is called complex analysis for a reason, it talks mostly about theory which i truely understand that was the intention). More practical and applied problems would be a benefit to those who are not just visual learners but also want to understand more about the importance of complex analysis.    The book is good, get it.
B00005JA2B|5.0|You want to know what \\"progressive\\" rock is, just listen to the Cheyenne Anthem from this disc. I have been of fan of Kansas since their first album (love Pilgrimage), and to this day their music just blows me away. I tell my kids who listen to (c)Rap music that I actually feel sorry for them, to not be be able to  appreciate the true musicianship and prolific lyrics of bands like Kansas. This album is a true masterpiece.

B001AQTWF2|2.0|Whitney Houston's first album in seven years opens with the Alicia Keys composition \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", a retro Philly-sounding dance tune without the gorgeous string arrangements.  Here, Houston seems to be having fun singing about having a man who makes you feel like a million bucks.<br /><br />After that great burst of energy, the rest of the album is somewhat uneven.  The power ballads \\"I Look To You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" are solid songs in need of a good church choir background and solid orchestration to really bring the lyrics and Houston's vocals to the forefront.  \\"Worth It\\" has a nice message, but it sounds too much like something on a recent Mariah Carey album.  The remake of the Leon Russell classic \\"A Song For You\\" starts off slow before changing into a techno disco tune.  Perhaps it would have been better if this song began slowly, the sequed into a gentle bossa-nova feel (think of those classic Stan Getz recordings) complete with a cushy string arrangement and a smoldering sax or a romantic classical guitar solo.<br /><br />The rest of the songs feature too much generic drum programming, and even Akon drops in to add his overused Autotune technique on \\"Like I Never Left\\".  What's really missing from this set is the usual obscure single or album cut from another artist that Ms Houston reinvents into a smash hit (for example, \\"All The Man I Need\\" was originally a Sister Sledge single).  Too much of the material on this album sounds like something written for an up-and-coming artist (i.e. the lastest American Idol winner) rather than a seasoned veteran like Houston.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is another gem from Miyazaki, It is another environmental morality tale like   Princess Monanokee, but set in a post apocalyptic setting. My five year old and I were both   delighted by the story. The character motivation is at some points a little hazy,  but this is more than made up for by beautiful animation and a fascinating   vision of what if.
1881273156|5.0|I would recommend this book to any couple anywhere, successful or struggling.  Dr. Chapman provided me with some incredible insight into my own relationship, and I feel that the concept of this book is right on target.  Best relationship book I've read to date.
B000001FDP|5.0|As near to a style of electronic opera as one can imagine. While the tonality is firmly rooted in western modes, Vangelis manages a level of timbral and textural depth that is striking, furious and beautiful. After his Beaubourg series, this is likely one of his darkest works (though more accessible).<br /><br />This album might indeed be his analog electronic music swan song, for none of his subsequent works in the years since has employed his trademark analog sound to the same effect; like so many of his contemporaries, he was all too quickly infatuated with the meaningless bric-a-brac and sonic mimicry of the digital sampling age.<br /><br />For aficionados of the analog electronic sound, I can't recommend this highly enough.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I normally HATE book to film adaptations.  They usually do an awful job at translating from one form of media to another.  True Blood does not, it is far beyond anything I could have hoped for.  It is faithful to the story concept of the series, while making the story it's own.  It doesn't try to do a direct translation, as this would likely make for uninteresting characters on the screen.  The characters on True Blood have jumped out of the pages of the Southern Vampire books and become independent entities.  We need more shows of True Blood's caliber.  A LOT more shows like this.
B00009AOBI|5.0|this movie has everything going for it.     it's true, it's good. Cher, Sam Elliott, Estelle Getty, bikes & great bikers. and people with a back bone.     you end up loving all of them. It's a movie you watch over & over.

B001AQTWF2|3.0|I am not a die hard fan, but listening to this cd left me a bit numb and confused. Whitney has an amazing voice, but it did'nt seem to come through. I have listeneed to the cd and in all, it's an alright attemt to showcase her talent. I feel some of the tracks were lacking emotion. I am sure sure all the die hard fans are gonna love this, but most of them would agree there was a lot of room for a little bit more. Opening the cd with MILLION DOLLAR BILL was smart, but as the songs play out, you kinda get lost. I dont feel the emotion that she was know for. I feel that Whitney was interturpting the songs, rather then placing her stamp vocals of emotions, as she has done may times before. As whole, the cd is alright.
B00288KNL8|4.0|Coraline has trouble getting used to her new home, one that she shares with a Mom and Dad who don't seem to have a lot time for her. The neighbors are weird and there isn't much around. So when she finds a doorway to another world, one that's like hers but better, she begins to get lured over to the other side...<br /><br />The animation is done really well and the storyline is for the most part consistent. I liked this film, even though it won't make my top tier in films. Some of the visuals are VERY strange, especially the show put on by the two ladies downstairs, but you should check this out.
0307588335|4.0|Lehman Brothers was near the epicenter of the financial meltdown that struck Wall Street full force during 2008. The story of its failure is a useful starting point for anyone trying to grasp the origins of the economic crisis that is still unfolding today. Lawrence McDonald was a trader of distressed bonds for Lehman, and while he wasn't senior enough in the organization to see everything going on around and above him, he was close enough to the action that he has a pretty interesting yarn to tell. The book is also partially an autobiography, and his personal story is emblematic of the over-achieving business culture that ultimately drove Wall Street to its demise. McDonald's father was a successful, hot-tempered businessman, who divorced his wife when Larry was a child and left the family with genteel habits but no money to support them. Larry thus grew up with a classic poor-boy's drive to regain his place in the world, and he seems to have set his sights on Wall Street at early age. He made it though college, but at a lower-tier school unlikely to excite much interest from the likes of Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs. He claims to have sent out \\"thousands\\" of resumes, and even took to stunts like dressing up as a delivery boy to con his way into the offices of pizza-hungry CEO's, where he pleaded for jobs. He received nothing. Deciding he needed marketing experience, he took a job with a Connecticut-based food wholesaler and quickly worked his way up to become what his calls the star pork-chop salesman in the Northeastern United States. But even with his pork-chop laurels now documented on his resume, the banks took no interest. Spotting opportunity in the e-commerce boom that got underway in mid-1990's, he and a friend started an internet-based information clearing house for the convertible bond market. Through hard work, hustle and good timing, this business succeeded well enough to attract the attention of Morgan Stanley, who acquired the little company and took McDonald on as an employee. Thus did he finally gain a back-door entry into the world he had been seeking. Once there, like many people, he found  lucrative job changes easy to come by. He soon moved to Lehman Brothers and hustled his way onto the firm's high-voltage trading floor, where he started earning the big bonuses he had yearned for.  Little did he realize it at the time, but he would have less than four years there before the whole thing blew up in his face. He was not a mortgage trader himself, but offers a reasonably good discussion of this arcane business that was ultimately at the root of Lehman's failure and central to the implosion of Wall Street itself and the American economy. He displays little sympathy for anyone involved in the mortgage industry, and heaps particular scorn on the slick brokers who got rich while shifting unsupportable risk onto both homeowners and institutional investors. McDonald reserves his hottest fire, however, for senior management at Lehman Brothers, particularly its long-time CEO Dick Fuld. I find there's usually something morally suspect about insider tell-alls of the sort that this book purports to be. One wonders what McDonald was really thinking to have broken down the doors as he did to make it on Wall Street, only to feel shock at finding there was reckless greed going on there. The attitude seems disingenuous. Dick Fuld deserves accountability for what occurred on his watch, but he was hardly the villainous dunderhead portrayed in this book. Nor were McDonald's distressed-debt trading buddies likely to have been quite the warm, clear-sighted geniuses he makes them out to be. They, Fuld, McDonald himself, and thousands of others all were part of a Wall Street culture that had a glorious run but ultimately foundered on its own excess. Unfortunately the culture had become critically important to the global economy,  and many people today are suffering from the breakdown who had no part in causing it. This book benefits from the voice of a talented storyteller, which I assume is largely that of McDonald's collaborator, Patrick Robinson. The book flawed but informative. It's aptly titled.efits from the voice of a talented storyteller, which I assume is largely that of McDonald's collaborator, Patrick Robinson. The book flawed but informative. It's aptly titled.
B001SGEUNI|4.0|I almost wrecked my car the first time I heard Halestorm on the radio; not only do they have a powerful female on lead vocals, but the guitar riffs are awesome. I haven't heard anything like this since the early 90s. I listen to a wide variety of music genres, but I didn't stop liking rock just because hip-hop & electronica seemed to take over. I guess rock stations aren't as popular as they once were, and great rock albums are even harder to come by.<br /><br />THEN THERE WAS HALESTORM! Yaaay! I have always been a huge fan of female rockers like the Wilson sisters in Heart, Lita Ford, and Bonnie Tyler, just to name a few -- I even like the chick's vocals in [[ASIN:B000089RVX Evanescence]], but it's been a long time since I heard something like [[ASIN:B001SGEUNI Halestorm]]. My favorite tracks are the first three: It's Not You, I Get Off, and Bet U Wish U Had Me Back. I love the lyrics, love the vocals, and can't get enough of the guitars.<br /><br />The lyrics are sexual (reminds me of Bret Michael's lyrics a little*edit*&lt;--I take this back, Halestorm's lyrics have some depth to them), which isn't anything new in the world of rock'n'roll, but it's refreshing to hear a chick addressing guys instead of the other way around. Each track has its own unique sound, which is great because I can't stand repetition.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five was the number of slower songs versus faster songs. I am starved for an album that doesn't rely so heavily on slow tracks, but it seems to happen a lot with female lead vocals.<br /><br />All in all, if you liked albums like [[ASIN:B000002U9C Heart]] or [[ASIN:B000008FP9 Dangerous Curves]], you're gonna love this album!<br /><br />Added September 12, 2009:<br /><br />I've actually been listening to this album every day since I wrote this review, and my opinion has changed slightly. I also love tracks 5,6,7, 8 and 9 just as much as the first three, if not more...so even though I thought it needed more faster songs, I ended up liking the slower ones despite my first impression. The thing is, quite a few of the tracks aren't slow or fast, but rather a mix of tempos. I wish I had waited a little longer to write my review; I would change my rating to five stars if the system let me.<br /><br />It's Not You is a fast track with lyrics about how she's in love with someone but it's not the guy she's talking to. I freakin' loved the bridge on this track, \\"you've probably never been shot down before.\\"<br /><br />I Get Off was the reason I started listening to Halestorm in the first place. Very seductive lyrics. Goes back and forth between slow and fast.<br /><br />Bet U Wish U Had Me Back is a self-explanatory slow track. Lyrics list the reasons the guy totally screwed up. Don't get me wrong though -- it's not a man-hating album, but thesongs are all about relationships from a woman's perpspective.<br /><br />Innocence is a slightly faster track with powerful lyric play. Very poetical. \\"You're just too perfect for my hands to own.\\"<br /><br />Familiar Taste Of Poison is dark and gothic. I thought it could be used in a [[ASIN:B001P5HRMI Twilight]] movie or something like that. Another track with an awesome bridge: \\"I don't want to be saved, I don't want to be sober\\"<br /><br />I'm Not An Angel was definitely a slow track with a sort of Blues/country tinge to it, and yet a bit orchestral on the chorus. Lots of levels in this ballad.<br /><br />What Were You Expecting has turned out to be my absolute favorite track. While I'm guilty of comparing the lead to other female vocals, she makes her own mark with this song, and establishes her own range and talent. I hope this track get some radio play very soon. This is the rock I have been looking for.<br /><br />Love/Hate Heartbreak is another track with a touch of Blues in the guitar riffs, which just shows how well-rounded they are as musicians. I'd place this as a faster track, but it's a good example of how they mix tempos to rock out.<br /><br />Better Sorry Than Safe has great music but the lyrics is a little depressing. \\"Sometimes I wish you'd cheated on me, then leavin' here would be so easy.\\"<br /><br />Dirty Work and Nothing To Do With Love are great rock tracks, but I just couldn't get into the lyrics. They aren't bad, but I think they should have placed these two at the beginning because the rest of the album is a tough act to follow.<br /><br />So, I've learned my lesson, and will not be in such a hurry to review new music...in the meantime, I continue to let Halestorm dominate all my music players, wherever I am...ou'd cheated on me, then leavin' here would be so easy.\\"    Dirty Work and Nothing To Do With Love are great rock tracks, but I just couldn't get into the lyrics.

B000007MVD|2.0|If you're a fan of anything live the Beatles have done, then this album is just right for you. There are funny snipits of interviews and conversations they've had with the BBC that will make you laugh. There are also a couple of songs previously unheard like John's cover of \\"Memphis, TN\\" and Paul's version of \\"Til There Was You\\" is actually better than the recorded album version on this take.<br /><br />But if I have this CD on my ipod I find myself skipping the majority of the songs because they just aren't as good as their best work. So this album is just okay for me.<br /><br />The insert is great. Lots of pictures, some previously not ever seen. Many taken at the BBC studios.<br /><br />If you're a die-hard Beatles fanatic, then definitely buy. If you're just starting out, buy their other albums first before this one. Get to know their music first. This is definitely not for the faint of heart :)

B00003RQNJ|4.0|Good movie, great acting from Paul Newman and Robert Redford. It was a little long for me, but part of the appeal of this movie is the long, rambling chase between cops and robbers that encapsulates the plot.     All in all, solid cinema.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|I have a feeling I saw this when it came to TV sometime after release in 1980. I do remember ghosts and a fog; that's  about all. Picked it up at minimum price as I was on the check-out line at Borders today. Just one of those evenings when a ghost story seemed in order. Perhaps it was because yesterday, as I glanced over to a point about a half mile from where I stood, the tall buildings had their upper stories cloaked in, yes, truly, fog. Somewhat to  my surprise, as the first movie I have seen in a few months, it kept my attention until the final stages; always the toughest part to script in a film of this sort. Inevitably, there was a bit of a let-down for me,  though, obviously. not for many other viewers. All in all, I can recommend it for those who go for this kind of thing as a decent outing with little of the kind of cheap shot violence that takes the place of writing/directing skill.
078322804X|2.0|I liked Animal House, and I thought John Belushi was funny in everything I'd seen. Then I saw this SNL abortion.    Let me preface this with a disclosure: I hate musicals. But more of a problem is that I hate corny cliched screenwriting and flat, bland dialogue. No amount of shopping mall car chases can make up for a script with the sense of humor of a cat related inspirational plaque-owning Midwestern housewife.    On to the music: Ray Charles, James Brown, and Aretha Franklin are some of my favorite R&B artists. But I am not interested in seeing them sing long, awkwardly placed musical numbers that confuse the plot and slow the pace to a handicapped crawl.    This movie was a waste of torrent bandwidth. Watch [[ASIN:0978832345 National Lampoon Animal House 29th Anniversary Edition]] or [[ASIN:B000P0J07O Caddyshack]] instead.
B002M5ZCEU|5.0|There are so many different ways to say what a triumph this CD is, but at the end of the day, it's just a sheer pleasure to be able to say the words \\"I love the new Whitney CD!\\" after 11 years of waiting (and no, I don't count the quickly-cobbled-together \\"Just Whitney\\" or her Christmas album).<br /><br />Yeah, her voice is older and smokier than in the past, and if that's the only litmus test you have for her new CD you might be tempted to rate it lower.  But there is still nobody in music who can sing like Whitney, there just isn't.  When every wannabe singer on American Idol tries to replicate her voice and her delivery, they just can't.  There is/always will be only on Whitney.<br /><br />As for the music - I would have listened to her sing her ABC's and loved it, but I really do genuinely like this whole set.  A great mix of slow/mid/uptempo R&B, there's something here for every mood.  She seems to realize that her voice and her range can suitably fit just about any genre, but the selection of songs here (including the totally club-ready torch song \\"A Song for You\\" - one of my favorites) shows that she is once again in the masterful hands of Clive Davis, the man who made her career and, ultimately, saved her life in every sense of the word.<br /><br />LOVE this CD and am so, so glad that Whitney is back.<br /><br />PS - since some reviewers are commenting that the vocal acrobatics are absent from this CD: she doesn't need them.  Put a gospel song in front of her today and I can guarantee you she would sing her face off.  That she took so much heat for them in the past and is now taking heat for NOT having them is amusing - she has nothing to prove, and she sounds better for knowing so.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I've been tuning into Smallville since Episode 1, and have been a fan of Superman since I was a little kid.    Smallville is one of the greatest interpretations of Superman ever created in any type of medium (comic book, TV, etc.)  And I was disappointed to see that Smallville Season 8 only received an average rating of 3.5 stars.  Most of the lower rated reviews include complaints about how the show is starting to lose credibility with it's comic counterpart.  In other words it doesn't tie into the comic book that well, the finale of Season 8 was anti climactic, how the writing is starting to dwindle, so on so forth.    Smallville is an INTERPRETATION of the comic book story.  It is NOT the comic book itself.  So to bash Season 8 because it doesn't tie in to the comic that well is pretty silly, cause there have been apparent changes from the comic book since Season 1.  And if you are a long time fan of Smallville, why bash season 8 for something that's been going on since .. well .. forever?     Smallville has always stayed true to the basics of the Superman mythos.  Clark and Lex are enemies.  Lois and Clark will fall in love.  Clark will become Superman, etc.  And I don't believe for a second that Lex is truly dead.  And if he is then damn the writers to hell.  Although it is highly unlikely that Rosenbaum will return to the cast of Smallville, I am for certain we have not heard the last from Lex.  He cant be dead ... come on ... he's Lex Luthor.    The writers have done an amazing job picking up from Season 7.  Despite the loss of Michael Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor), they still do a great job of tying in Lex to the story without actually having him on screen.    Tess Mercer fills in for Lex as the new CEO for Luthercorp.  Pretty much the new \\"bad guy\\" to give Clark and his friends a hard time.  And although Lex is missed (A LOT!!!)  She's good.  Nuff said.      Also in this season we are treated with the ever growing romance between Lois and Clark.  Love is in the air in season 8!  (Is love ever NOT in the air?)  But I have always admired Smallville for it's character development, especially with Clark's love interests (well mostly Lana).  But Lois and Clark are as equally intoxicating to watch as Lana and Clark in previous seasons.    Erica Durance plays the best Lois Lane I have ever seen.  She nails her personality flawlessly.  Naive, cocky, rude, Clarks opposite ... his perfect match.    And what about the final battle between Doomsday in the Season Finale?  What about it?  Nothing short of ... awesome can you say?  Many complained that the battle was too short and anti climactic.  It depends on how you see it.  In my opinion, the battle had started the day Clark met Davis Bloome (Doomsday).  It wasn't the physical battle so much as it was the emotional battle that Clark went through, and the writers did a superb job presenting it.  Can Clark overcome the beast without killing him?  Time and time again through Season 8, Clark is tempted by his friends, and even his fellow heroes that sometimes the only way to save the day is to kill.  That killing is a sacrifice a hero has to make once in a while to benefit the greater good of mankind.   But Clark shows why he isn't a hero.  He shows why he is a superhero.  He can make the decisions that no one else can make, not even heroes like Green Arrow.  That there is always a way to save the world without crossing the line, and that a life is a life no matter who it may be.    Season 8 is awesome, and even after 8 years, Smallville has not lost its quality when compared with previous seasons.  The drive of the show, the ambition of the show has remained the same.        If you are a fan of Smallville don't compare it to other mediums of Superman, but cherish as is.      If you do you wont be disappointed.  5 stars.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|This was an excellent movie and in great condition.  Bravo to Baz for creating this incredible movie.  My girlfriend in the movie industry was speachless in a great way.

B00009MGGI|5.0|When I started this series, I wondered what I was in for, as I understand nothing of British politics. The first episode was a bit slow, but by the second installment of House of Cards, I was completely hooked. I literally stayed up all night watching Francis Urquhart out-Machiavelli Machiavelli.<br /><br />The House of Cards Trilogy is not, as many seem to think, a critique of the Conservative Party. It is a critique of Machiavellian politics of any stripe. Over the course of the trilogy, the drama delivers a clear Macbeth-style warning against the dangers of unbridled ambition--and against those for whom the means is justified by the end. Ian Richardson's performance as Francis Urquhart, a man who will stop at nothing to gain power, is absolutely brilliant. Witty, sly, and supremely self-controlled, he utterly captures the screen and glues you to it. Together with his wife, Elizabeth, who is a perfect Lady Macbeth, they comprise the ideal villain--unscrupulous, cunning, manipulative, and without a shred of conscience. Almost. By the end of the trilogy, Urquhart's misdeeds have come back to haunt him, but it is too late. He is on a path that cannot be abandoned. \\"I am steeped in blood so far,\\" he says. (Actually, the original quote, from Macbeth Act III, is \\"I am stepp'd in blood so far...\\", but we get the picture.)<br /><br />The House of Cards Trilogy is easily one of the most engrossing, and at times downright disturbing, series I have ever seen. Parts of it are a stretch, especially towards the end (in which the plot seem to flounder in its own excesses), but just like Macbeth, the message comes through loud and clear. With this series, I'd say the BBC has outdone itself.
B000001DYY|5.0|I was looking for Roland O. for a long times? And I happen to find it on Amazon.com am quite happy?Thank You!
B001684L0A|5.0|When I watched this work, I wondered the beauty of screen of monitor. Of corse not only the visuals , also audio has a reality of the whisper of surrownd sounds. Not only over terms ,but also, this is the series of the TV contents. Actually I am live in Japan, I didn't watch this kind of documentaly series, except National Heritages Series made by SONY and TBS in JAPAN. Anyway I am Japanese but it made me very exciting and move my heart. Great job in these ten years, I think so.

I also would say this book has a lot of the fantasy things that I enjoy reading about..the cover is simple but once you read the book you will know the meaning of it....I'm sure I will read this book over and over again...
B000001EAQ|4.0|Pop. The album the band and most of their fans have summarily disimissed.  What a shame.  Many of the tracks on this album are among the most interesting the band has ever produced.  In fact, it isn't until the latter half of the album that it starts to unravel a bit.  A couple of substitute tracks could've saved this album.    Had they just gotten rid of \\"miami,\\" and \\"playboy mansion\\" and substituted \\"hold me, thrill me, kiss me, kill me\\" and the b-side cover of \\"happiness is a warm gun,\\" this album may have been received very differently.  Admittedly \\"miami\\" and \\"playboy mansion\\" suck.  Then again there are missteps here and there on every U2 album, even on the so-called Classic albums.  On achtung baby there's \\"who's gonna ride your wild horses,\\" that song sucks, but no one dismisses achtung baby because of it.  So it should be with Pop.   \\"Discotheque\\" is a pulse-pounding, rocket-flying, let-loose track, in the style of \\"the fly,\\" \\"lemon\\" and \\"vertigo.\\" \\"Mofo,\\" \\"do you feel loved,\\" \\"If god will send his angels,\\" \\"staring at the sun,\\" \\"last night on earth,\\" and especially the live ROCKER \\"gone\\" are seven straight stand-out tracks. \\"velvet dress\\" is probably the only truly substantial track of the latter part of the album, but that's ok with me.  U2 have to screw around sonically to get where they're going next.  Without those missteps maybe the need to create an album like \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind,\\" never would have happened, and that album was CRITICAL to the band's survival.  So at least 8/12 tracks here are outstanding.  I usually buy an album as long as I like at least 5 tracks, so 8 is a definite must-buy.  Forget the nay-sayers, and pick up one of U2's most interesting works.
0547258305|5.0|I can honestly say is one of the best books I read this year so far...Yes is that good! Such a compelling story and the characters you will definitely wanted to know more about them...I completely feel in love with Katsa and Po (actually more Po than Katsa...for the record!) But is a very refreshing story line starting with the fact that our heroine is the Best killer! What a masterpiece Graceling is...I'm eager to read more and more about the seven kings...I want to know more about the characters. Even after finished the book I just couldn't get it out of my mind! Fans of The mortal Instruments and Hunger Games will enjoy the action and romance in this book...In my humble opinion a Must read!
0671891634|5.0|This book, even though written in the 1980s, still applies today.  Great for beginners since Lynch is very easy to read.
0553582038|3.0|I will assume that the readers of Song of Ice and Fire series of novels are familiar with the above mentioned novels. Does everyone see the parallel? All undoubtedly great authors, the first three or four books in the series start out with great beginnings and you think WOW these are some of the best fantasy novels I have ever read. These novels garnish (deserved) great reviews. Expecting the next novels to be equally well written and purchasing them with great anticipation you are forced to read pages upon pages of how beautiful the women are and what they are wearing (Wheel of time) or read pages upon pages of the Authors philosophy yack, yack, yack, Sword of Truth. At least George R R Martin hasn't gone off the deep end yet. Although I think sometimes he should tell his story from the view point of a few central characters and not every character mentioned in his novel its just to much to keep up with and you feel the book is to convoluted. Heres hoping the next novel in the series advances the story.
0525951113|3.0|I do not like to write summaries of the book.  So all I will do is just to write an opinion which I hope that will help others to decide whether they even want to read it.    For the most part, this book is quite well-researched and written.  The hacker/gamer subcultures were portrayed fairly accurately, albeit with some artistic license.  The setup is engaging, and you are kept wondering what's next.  But somewhere near the 2/3 mark, you get the feeling that Suarez lost a bit of steam and he began substituting intellectual intrigue for mindless action (robotic cars / non-cars, things blowing up and everything).  Also, because of the sheer number of \\"main\\" characters in the book, none are particularly well-developed and you don't feel for any of them.  Perhaps this will be corrected in the sequel.  Which brings me to the next point.    This book is obviously incomplete.  The ending explains nothing (and if you have half a brain, you will expect it by the time you reach the middle).  I have nothing against multi-part books.  But no matter what, I believe that a book/film should at least have some form of satisfactory conclusion at each point.  Think Lord of the Rings.  Think the Godfather film trilogy.  Think Harry Potter even.  We all knew that the story is not completely concluded, but at the end of each book, we are left satisfied that most of the subplots in the one book is done.  If we stopped reading then, we will lose the remainder of the story, but nonetheless, feel richer for what we have already read.      That is not the case in this book.  At the end, you are left with only things blowing up and hints of a bigger war.  No conclusions.  No loose ends tied up.  You are left with a feeling that this book is like a write-up on what technological trends (yeah yeah, distributed computing and software.... a second life in real life, etc.) which will wow the non-gamer/hacker about the possibilities, but will leave almost anyone with any experience in gaming or hacking unimpressed.  I felt cheated.  I would rather Suarez doubled the size of the book and finished it completely, or at the very least, cut the story off at a more appropriate juncture.    I will definitely read the inevitable sequel, if only just to see what happens.  It is an easy read afterall.  I can only hope if Hollywood ever comes knocking, the film makers will have the good sense to either condense it into one film or to adjust the cutoffs.
B002BFBAWO|3.0|There is an unmistakable ramshackle and unfocused feel to this coming of age comedy about the pains and pleasures of working a thankless summer job, and it suits the movie quite nicely.  The plot, in a nutshell, follows a summer in the life of James, a teen who finds himself forced to take a job in a rundown amusement park in Pittsburgh after his parents suffer a financial setback that won't allow them to pay his way through college.  James is played by Jesse Eisenberg as a neurotic, insecure, niave and ultimately likeable kid not unsimilar to the many characters played by Michael Cera.  In fact, somebody should put the two of them in a movie together as brothers or cousins or something.  But I digress.<br /><br />Adventureland follows James as he gets a reality check about working a crappy job to pay for college, forms friendships with the other oddball park employees and falls in love with Em, played by Kristen Stewart.  The movie is at its best when it sticks to the details of what it's like to work at an amusement park; the rigged games, angry patrons, rides that bread down and the general camaraderie that the employees develop as they just hang out with one another.  During these vignettes, Adventureland is an engagingly askew comedy.  It doesn't really have any focused center.  It's just about being young, hanging out and hoping that the future works out.<br /><br />The movie is less successful when it focuses on the romance between James and Em.  Eissenberg and Stewart are a likeable couple, but they never really feel all that convincing.  I for one never beleived that their feelings for one aonther went that deep so the subplots about Em's affair with Ryan Reynolds' character or James' date with coworker Melissa P. never really added much to the mix.  If anything, they were a distraction from the film's comedic center and they took time away from hilarious supporting players such as Martin Starr and Bill Hader.<br /><br />Nevertheless, with it's scruffy appeal, smart and funny dalogue and cool soundtrack (The Replacements and Lou Reed figure prominently in the mix), Adventureland is ultimately an enjoyable movie that leaves you feeling that it could have been something more.dalogue and cool soundtrack (The Replacements and Lou Reed figure prominently in the mix), Adventureland is ultimately an enjoyable movie that leaves you feeling that it could have been something more.
B000S0GYRU|2.0|Suspiria may be one of the most polarizing films in the horror genre.  Like the movie Lost in Translation, people seem to either love it or hate it (I hated Lost in Translation as well).  Many fans of Suspiria will claim those who hate it just aren't smart enough to get the movie.  Those who despise Suspiria wonder what flavor of Kool-Aid the fans have been drinking.  I won't rehash the plot since it's been summarized over many reviews, but I do think the film is worth watching (but only once).  The first death sequence is quite shocking and the music is one of the most haunting horror scores I've ever heard.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|It took a little bit of time to assemble the turner table. A bold printer should be on the outside of the label. THe overall product is great.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|You all need to get a receipt for your crack!!  This CD sucks!  Her voice sounds like she smokes a carton of Newports a day!  I listen to her earlier music all time time on my ipod when her voice was great and uninjured.  It sounds like her tounge is stuck to the roof of her mouth.  It seems as though she is taking great effort to stop herself from slurring! I am glad she is in recovery or in remission from her disease. There are life long prices to pay when you abuse yourself. God Bless you Whitney! Become a teacher share your experience so you can help someone else from making the same mistake you may have made.
B000ZN802W|5.0|This movie will make you ask yourself two questions. First is Would I go to such extremes to escape my reality/life? and Second Am I this delusional about my dreams of living in the wilderness? If both answers are yes then somebody needs to lock yourself up and throw away the key. Seriously the film will show you the downward spiral of a young guy´s hopes and dreams. Sean Penn is a genious when it comes to choosing his projects, this one is no exception.    This story will make you think about your own life and how you plan to live it after you´ve seen this movie, mainly think about the value of human life in regards to wasting it with crazy dreams. I say crazy because I imagine the real life guy whose this movie is inspired/based on was, or probably was, mentally disturbed. This is just my opinion of course.    Now in regards to the acting in the film all I can say is Emile Hirsch was superb. Marcia Gay Harden and William Hurt are both Oscar winners and they never dissapoint, their acting was spellbinding, cringeworthy and mindblowing.    I bought the movie to check out Kristen Stewart´s small albeit beautiful role. She portrays perfect innocence and wild allure in her character. Kristen never dissapoints when it comes to her indie films long career.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|It doesn't take a second listening to fall in love with this album. Whitney's long awaited comeback \\"I Look To You\\" delivers a living proof that, once a diva, always a diva.<br /><br />The first half of this album is better than the second, in my honest opinion. Chilling songs, dancing ballads, perfect production, flawless singing, a surprising remake of \\"A Song for You\\" and a self-revealing/confessional tune \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" makes it a great investiment that was worth the wait.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I was very happy with this product. The seller's discription was spot-on. This is my daughter's favorite movie. She had the video and her tape player ate it so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. You guys saved us a lot of grief. Thanks! Michael
B000FP2OPY|5.0|A dear friend of mine first lent me this series of DVDs thinking that I might enjoy them, given my interest in the occult.  By interest in the occult, I assumed that he meant that he found my sacrifice of a virginal chicken upon the passing of the Winter Solstice to be a slight deviation of social memes.  I immediately shot back that \\"social memes\\" is a big brain talking point for nerd-ville and that the marking of a new growing season has always been recognized in blood, and THAT should be the social meme, not a jolly fat man sneaking into your house to drop off candy for your kids.  Sheesh, it's like I have to explain everything!<br /><br />Anywhoo,<br /><br />This series follows the lives of two brothers who hunt demons and find a way to end up shirtless by the end of every episode.  It's kind of like The Ghost Whisperer in that way.  In EVERY episode Jennifer Love Hewitt is seen, at least once, walking around in a night gown.  She hunts ghosts or something... but she wears a silky nighty.  Every episode.  It is spectacularly awesome.  Seriously, it's the best show ever.  Watch the show if you doubt me.<br /><br />Often times the mythos and creatures that are fought off every episode are not particularly compelling or original.  However, do not let this dissuade you from watching.  The true creative genius of this show is the brother dynamic that is both carefully and skillfully written into each episode.  There is pure comic timing as well as tender moments expressed between the sensitive brother Jared Padaleckidakciakdibikcicky (Sam) and the strong and obnoxious Jensen Ackles (Dean).  The first season introduces the characters, the basic monster of the week premise and an overarching mother-killing-demon conspiracy.<br /><br />This is what is original.<br /><br />This is what is compelling.<br /><br />Lest you forget, original founders of this great country that is the United States of America were hunting witches and killing Bigfoots (BigFeet?) the moment they got off the boat during that tea party in Boston.  I'm pretty sure I read that Christopher Columbus was a ghost hunter in his down time.  Or a spice merchant... I always get it mixed up....<br /><br />In any event, beyond the monsters stories, comic timing, and character development, there are the rippling abs of the two costars...  Never before have I witnessed such fine specimens of human physiology....  Not that their bodies do anything for me, per say, I like women!  I do!  I'm married and everything!  That's proof right?  But my wife LOVES Dean, and therefore the show.  I'm not sure she knows there are even monsters involved... if you were to ask her she'd say the show is about two brothers driving around the country acting as farm hands....<br /><br />Silly girl...<br /><br />Now, where's that Ghost Whisperer show....in Boston.

B000NU2CY4|2.0|Gladiator was one of the most anticipated titles on Blu-ray, but this release comes from an old master (used for the DVD in 2000) and suffers from too much DNR (digital noise reduction, which smudges detail) and edge enhancement (outlines around edges).  In fact, there are details present on the DVD that are missing from the Blu-ray.  On the other hand, Braveheart (released on Blu-ray on the same day) has a fantastic picture and makes Gladiator look even worse.  The best thing to do is to pick up Braveheart (if you like the movie, of course) and wait for the eventual re-release of Gladiator.

B000S0GYRU|2.0|I have been a horror fan since I got nightmares from watching the Shining at a very young age. Even the nightmares could not stop me from wanting more and more from this often looked down upon genre. Even today, as bad as they might be, I just can't stay away from some of the worst movies this Genre has to offer. I have always heard about Suspiria and it's visionary director, Dario Argento. I have even seen clips, of the movie, and thought it seemed interesting visually, but for some reason or another I never did seek it out. We'll it did come on one of the Premium channels last week, and I Tivo'd it for later. I sat down very excited with the bowl of popcorn, ready for some horror like I had never experienced. And I waited. And I waited. And I waited.<br />Aside from the first death at the beginning and a closet scene at the end, the movie never really impressed me.<br />Is the soundtrack good?<br />Yes, it's very creepy and excellent, although a little overused at times.<br />Is the lighting good?<br />Again, yes, very good use of lighting, I'm sure film students all over the world could get an education from it.<br />Is the movie actually good?<br />I really can't say it is.<br />If your a film buff or a horror fan, and you haven't seen it, then I suppose a watch wouldn't be the worst thing in the world. As I said before, it has it's moments. It also has a really good premise. The whole time I was thinking that if someone would respect the way in which it was shot and the soundtrack, that it would be a great remake. As long as Rob Zombie did not do it that is. But as a movie, it's just not very good. The mood is very well set, there just isn't much going on inside it.

B001PPLJIQ|1.0|Any human has feelings, soul and only one life to live, and as such, any person can find empathy and sympathy. But this is exactly what Nazis ignored, ignored the value of millions of lives. How can I, just for a minute allow myself to feel empathy for one of them? That would be treason.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|I really wanted to like this because as a long-time Whitney fan I missed her great voice. Well, I find this cd very lacking and unremarkable. And, her great voice is rough and tired. It seems like there is no power behind the vocals anymore. The style of the music is different, like something I would expect from Beyonce. The track I Look to You is probably the best on the cd, but in comparison that is not a huge compliment.  Sorry, Whitney fans, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed.

After a week into the work out I noticed dynamic changes in my body. I was toned, had more strength in just a weeks time. Seeing these results I have continued it so far and am extremely happy with my purchase. I am not the kind of person who purchases work our DVDS but I would highly recommend this. I must say the 20 minute work outs are very convenient. A must say for anyone who needs to shed weight or need some toning.

Then I ordered the board book version so my 12-month-old doesn't rip the pages. \\"Goodnight Gorilla\\" is her book of choice when she picks one for me to read--she even \\"reads\\" it on her own. The concept of the story is so simple--yet so witty and imaginative. I narrate the pictures so my daughter can learn about animals and what is going on in the book. I even ordered a copy for my niece! I highly recommend this book! :)
0307269981|5.0|This sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is an absolute page turner. Salander is one of the most complex and interesting characters I have read. Only disappointment is that there is only one more book in this series by Stieg Larsson. Can't wait to read it but hate to come to the end of Salander and Blomkvist.
0061854549|1.0|There's little to learn in this book that hasn't been covered in numerous other books, (eg The Paradox of Choice). What disappointed me most was that all or most of the studies seem to have been conducted by the author and his colleagues and don't seem to be further supported by outside analysis.  In addition, approx 50 pages of the book are given to the author's thoughts on the subprime mortgage crisis.  Why?
0060849827|5.0|I bought this book to put in our survival kit in the event of an emergency. It's loaded with many instructions that will be vital to know if a person were to be displaced from their home and had to live in the outdoors. Everything from how to identify edible plants, setting up a camp, first aid, even how to predict the weather. This is a 'pocket size' book that fits easily in any evacuation kit, glove box, etc..  I've bought a total of two of these books. I am glad to have them.

Then, imagine while you are there you have switched places with Elizabeth Bennet & nothing, absolutely nothing, is like the Jane Austen version of the story.  It is up to Amanda Price, the heroine of Lost, to try to make things turn up right.  Jemimah Rooper, who plays Amanda Price, is brilliant.  You will love this movie.
B002E01LL6|3.0|This movie holds true to the title.  The main stars of this movie include Channing Tatum, Terrence Howard, Brian White and Zulay Henao.  The acting is great and the characters are very memorable...which means they really played their parts.<br /><br />Tatum plays Shawn a small town boy in the big city trying to feed himself and survive by selling books etc on the street.  He gets connected to the gritty street fighting scene where big money can be made through Howard's character.  Henao is Shawn's love interest.  This is another underdog that comes up in the end story.  If you enjoy boxing or street fighting movies...then you might want to get this one.  It fits into the following genre of movies:  [[ASIN:B000WC3A0S Rocky - The Complete Saga Collection]], [[ASIN:B0006GAO40 Body and Soul]], [[ASIN:B000CCBCLW Penitentiary]], [[ASIN:B002FU8JTW Blood & Bone]].

B0026ZNL7Q|5.0|Upon first listen this CD didn't impress me as much as Second Life Syndrome and Rapid Eye Movement but, in recent memory, I can't think of a better example of \\"That one REALLY grew on me!!\\" Now it's tied for 2nd with 2nd life, though I still think REM is their best effort to date. But this CD definitely proves one thing if nothing else, their song writing skills are growing by leaps and bounds.<br /><br />And it's also hard to pick a favorite at this point, I don't think I've NOT listened to the entire thing, even on my MP3 player. Though the last ones, \\"Left Out\\" and \\"Hybrid Times\\" (the long ones), pack a heck of a 1-2 punch!!<br /><br />At this point I think it goes without saying to get the version with the bonus DVD. Since spring me & my buddies have been complaining (on message boards and in chat rooms) about the lack of a live DVD, guess they heard us!!!  :)<br /><br />While the DVD doesn't have my single favorite song, Cybernetic Pillow, it does have 3 of my top 5: Beyond the Eyelids, 02 Panic Room and Ultimate Trip (Rainbow Box being the fifth) so....how can I lose?!?! And, while it's only stereo, no 5.1, it sounds just fine, very well produced!<br /><br />If you like Riverside there is NO way you'll be disappointed, especially a month later. And if you like powerprog, progmetal, symphonic metal (whatever they're calling it this week) and want to check out Riverside, I'd say start with this because of the DVD. I still think REM is their best album.....by a hair.<br /><br />Now...if we could just get them to tour over here, preferably opening for someone like Porcupine Tree or Tool...I'd be a happy man!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|This Blu-Ray is the topic of much discussion across the HD world and the Internet.    Reputable sites like The Digital Bits who have seen the disc report :  \\"The problem is with the level of detail. The vast majority of the film has a slightly digital-looking quality to it, and there's clear edge-enhancement \\"haloing\\" visible. The extended edition scenes, however, look fine - no halos, no digital patina - they're very natural looking. If the whole film looked like the extended scenes, we wouldn't be having this conversation. What it looks like to me (though it's impossible to be sure, obviously), is that someone at Universal (keep in mind, it's Universal that controls the assets for DreamWorks - not Paramount), decided to re-use the original digital master of the HD transfer done back in 2000 for the very first DVD release.    Now, that transfer was state of the art for its day, and it was approved by director Ridley Scott, but obviously it's a far cry from the quality of new HD transfers done today, in 2009. One of the biggest problems is that until fairly recently, video mastering engineers were still applying edge-enhancement to their digital masters knowing that they were going to be used ultimately for standard-definition DVD release, and also analogue VHS and laserdisc. It took the mastering community a long time to break the habit.    In this transfer, you can see it in the image. It's also clear that the 2000 digital master has been digitally-filtered to reduce the haloing and other artefacts - the signs of DNR are not hard to miss. That's in contrast to the extended edition scenes, which were transferred in HD in 2005 and so look much better. They're still not quite up to today's standards, but they look far superior to the rest of the film and there's no edge-enhancement or obvious filtering visible. The footage simply looks natural - as it should.    There's been some talk of DNR being so excessive that - for example - arrows and fireballs disappear fromone frame to the next. This IS an issue, but the fact is that when you watch the image in full motion it's not something you really notice. The arrow or fireball is highly visible in one frame, less so in the next, more so in the third, etc. You still detect the object in motion, so you don't go, \\"Oh my god, that fireball just disappeared!\\" The image just looks generally digital and lacking in fine detail.\\"    So there,make up your own mind. I for one love this movie and have both the original and Special Edition on DVD and have just cancelled my Blu-Ray order with Amazon. I will not be forking out another 26 Bucks for a lesser quality Blu-Ray. Paramount need to fix this now!
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I've been a fan of Charlaine Harris's mysteries long before the Southern Vampire Series came out.  That being said, I viewed the coming of the series with some mixed emotions. I really needn't have worried, while the series is a loose interpretation of the books, I think the producers and actors depict the heart of the story with grit and humor.     This 12-episode disk roughly coincides with the first Sookie Stackhouse novel, \\"Dead Until Dark\\" which introduces you to Bon Temps Louisiana, Sookie, and her family.  The novel takes place right after the vampires 'come out' since the Japanese have invented a synthetic blood product called \\"True Blood\\" which meets all their dietary needs without having to feed on humans.  There's a movement to grant vampires full rights of citizenship and of course, the right and left wingers are lining up on either side.  A lot of action occurs in this short span of time. The body count is pretty high, including two waitresses from the local bar, Merlotte's, Sookie's grandmother, three vampires, and one of their fang-bangers. The local police are stymied about who committed the crimes and the anxiety level is near a fever pitch.     Meanwhile, people are getting addicted to vampire blood, which turns out to be better than cocaine. \\"Drainers\\" are killing vamps for their blood and addicts are paying a large chunk of change to get the life-expanding and libido-boosting formula.      Sookie herself is learning about love for the first time. A telepath, she's never been able to get close to a man since she knows what they're thinking. The vampire, Bill Compton, is the first individual who she cannot read. This worsens her reputation in the hidebound little town that seems to thrive on gossip.     The acting's on-key for the campy, scary, erotic nature of the stories. For me, the cast is very close to the vision I had in my head of the characters. The music's also great, adds the perfect Southern Louisiana touch to the whole story.     My one-star deduction is for the video quality.  A couple of the DVDs had long pauses in the middle and the sound quality had slight variances.  Acceptable, but not good enough for a 5-star rating.      Rebecca Kyle, August 2009

0061537969|3.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is a very lighthearted fun read! It is the kind of book I would want to curl up with and read all day on a cold fall day. It is a common story of a family's struggle to stay together and get through tough times, but it takes a unique angle with Enzo as our narrator. Enzo reminds any dog lover of the things they truly believe go on in their own dogs head. The passage about humans descending from monkeys and dogs not having thumbs (chapters 4-6) made me laugh out loud becuase that is a common conversation we have with our own dog...oh the things she could do with opposable thumbs! This book is for dog and non-dog lovers though because it is really about what it is to be human and in the end it seems Enzo understands that better than some of the people in his life. The ending was a bit too Disney for me. I would have preferred an ending where I was left to my own imagination of Enzo's future life. All in all though I would recommend this to anyone looking for a lighthearted and quick read.

I also found the back story and expose and passive descriptions-for-no-reason to be tiring. I mean, eight paragraphs to explain why Blomkvist has the nickname of Kalle?

1439102813|4.0|\\"Still Alice\\" by Lisa Genova is one of the best books I've read in years. It is a story of Alice, a woman in her 40s, and her early descent into  Alzheimer's Disease. Alice is a full professor at Harvard, and in very good physical condition, making it all the more tragic. Most stories about Alzheimer's are told from the viewpoint of the caretaker; this book is unusual in that it is told by the victim. It is easy to read and we suffer right along with Alice--there are many heart-wrenching, poignant scenes. I am choosing this book for our next book club meeting, as it is sure to provoke a lively discussion.
0743290127|2.0|I'm trying to find a plot. Lauren Weisberger, author of the bestselling THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA, disappoints with this shallow mess of a novel.<br /><br />Now, I usually prefer novels with human characters, even if they are selfish and shallow, because after all, there are people are like that in real life. Most of the time, the plot is enough to make up for the undesirable qualities of its main movers. But what sets apart CHASING HARRY WINSTON (and not in a good way) is the fact that these selfish, shallow characters seem to BE the plot. The novel is nothing but a few hundred pages of the main characters talking about themselves, and nothing else happens. Imagine Gossip Girl without the story line. That should give you a good idea.<br /><br />At times, the nonexistent plot is made up for with anecdotal scenes of absurdity. There are some ridiculous passages about a parrot named Otis who has self-esteem issues, mixed with gender confusion. Normally, this wouldn't have been so jarring, but there are many other passages similar to that throughout the book. Also, the way the characters speak is irritating and unrealistic. There is one character in particular-- the Brazilian super-beauty Adrianna --who insists on calling everyone \\"querida\\" or some such endearment. This same character doles out outlandish advice to other characters about the art of Brazilian seduction that would make any sane reader laugh. In the context of the novel, however, it is treated as good, solid instruction. Again, the lack of plot makes what would have otherwise been a tiny flaw into a fatal misfire.<br /><br />Another thing is that the writing isn't quite up to par. Weisberger, admittedly, stunned readers in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA with the story and characters; her writing style, while by no means bad, has never been the showpiece of her novels.  But in \\"Chasing\\", whatever style she had seems to go out the window. Nothing seems to flow; the paragraphs fit uneasily after one another, the wording sometimes feels wrong. And if there's a proper time to use the verb \\"crooned\\", Weisberger doesn't seem to know it. In the end, reading CHASING HARRY WINSTON is not just a waste of time, money, and brain cells, but also a draining experience that will leave you feeling cheated and with a bad taste in your mouth.And if there's a proper time to use the verb \\"crooned\\", Weisberger doesn't seem to know it.

0316779237|5.0|I had checked out this book at the college library back in 2004 by chance. It was my first exposure to David Sedaris and I later realized I'd known of his family through Amy Sedaris on \\"Strangers With Candy.\\" Since then, I've read all of his books and ran into other author's like him (Augusten Boroughs comes to mind.) I took my dad for his birthday two years ago to see David Sedaris read live, from his then upcoming book, When You Are Engulfed in Flames.<br /><br />I don't think there is a single Sedaris book I would not recommend. I've bought several copies of this book as holiday presents to cheer up grumpy family members and co-workers. I doubt any of David Sedaris's humor is lost on even the scrooge-iest of Scrooges. The book is short and broken into several articles/ segments as heard on NPR in the 90's (they occasionally replay them to this day.) Fast and quick and always a pleasure!
B001GKYBXA|3.0|Critics are funny.  They're quick to say something is \\"great\\" just because it's different.  Different is good.  In fact, I bought this album after learning that the Fireman was a collaborative effort between McCartney and Youth after having every critic basicaly say that the Fireman was simply an alter-ego for McCartney.  But this album is FAR from great.  It's merely \\"different\\" in the sense that it's NOT just another Paul McCartney album.  The album is listenable with some really good gems.  Some songs are just dry and repetitive though and I catch my self about to hit the \\"next track\\" button on the player.  I'll yank some tunes off this disc to put on my iPod for sure, but I don't see myself listening to this album all of the way through again any time soon.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney has done it again.   I am a long time fan so I may be one sided, but as a music lover I can say, I couldn't wait for this CD to come out.   I listened to the online sneak peak and played it to death.  I knew all the words before I even bought it!      I wont lie and say that I am in love with every song, but I will say that even the ones I wasnt in love with the first time I heard the CD all the way through, are growing on me now.       \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" is a fun upbeat song that I can already hear as people's ring tones. 8)    \\"I Look to You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" are fabulous, inspiring anthems that will be heard on American Idol auditions for years to come.  \\"Call You Tonight\\", \\"Like I Never Left\\", and \\"Worth It\\" are all tracks that would do well on the radio.     I really hope to see \\"Worth It\\" as a single even though I dont see much in the reviews about it, but it is a lover's anthem and would get air play from those people in new relationships and requested all night long!  (Can you tell it's my favorite?) I've been married for 11 years and it made me want to go dance with my husband.      It's truly unfortunate that there are still haters (as addressed in \\"Nothing But Love\\"), but Whitney, You still have a fan in me!

B0026NWBY2|4.0|This collection certainly does not fall short of showcasing George Harrison's brilliance.  I did not give it a perfect score, not because of Mr. Harrison himself, but due to the lack of some truly timeless classics.  Crackbox Palace, for example, is one of Harrison's most popular songs, yet it did not find it's way onto this compilation.  That said, it's good to see a couple Beatle's tracks (Guitar Gently Weeps, Something) as well as some early tracks (This Is Love, Blow Away, My Sweet Lord), some of the newer tracks (Fab, This is Love) as well as a few tracks off the posthumous Brainwashed album (Any Road, Marwa Blues, Rising Sun) all in one place.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|After a long dry spell, the best female singer in the modern era finally returns with an album of pleasing songs that recall the sound of her greatest years. There is nothing here that will be considered mind-blowing and that is perhaps a good thing. Whitney Houston has not resorted to using rappers and annoying song samples that so many of today's performers do.<br /><br />Dedicated fans should not be disappointed. From the up tempo opening \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", the songs reflect tasteful and mature compositions. \\"Call You Tonight\\" is another infectious number but the majority here are ballads that Whitney does so well. Stand-outs include the title track, \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" (written with Houston in mind by Diane Warren), \\"Salut\\" and a gorgeous duet with Akon \\"Like I Never Left\\". Houston's voice is a bit more gravely than in the past but she still displays a hint at her former greatness on \\"A Song For You\\".<br /><br />Let's hope that she is back for good and it won't be another seven years before the next release!

0316017922|5.0|Outliers: The Story of Success is Malcolm Gladwell's 2008 gift to social scientists, business people, parents and any lover of good writing. The same author who gave us Tipping Point and Blink, comes through with his most enjoyable read yet. My three favorite take-aways are 1) \\"The 10,000 Hour Rule\\" where Gladwell shows how much time it takes to become truly expert (using both the Beatles and Bill Gates as examples) and 2) \\"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\\" which may cause as many arguments as it supposedly solves; and 3) \\"The Matthew Effect\\" which gives a totally surprising and yet ultimately irrefutable understanding of why certain kids outperform others in sports.  And then there's the reason Asians are better at math--I'll let you read the chapter to find out.    Outliers is easy to read and covers a lot of territory, and it explodes many myths along the way.  I recommend it to anyone who wants to understand success better. You'll especially like this book if you enjoy challenging your own and others' beliefs...especially beliefs about success.

This is not true of the That's Entertainment collection.  Every film is very good and enjoyable to the fullest.  The world of MGM is fascinating and the movies highlight what was so special about the studio.  The studio developed their talent and trained them to perform.  Dance lessons, voice coaches, acting lessons, fashion advice and make-up sessions were offered.  The first movie highlights nostalgia, the second includes non-musical films and the third uses the perspective of film restorers and researchers (still fun).  All films include people who were involved in the business and resisted the suggestion of using younger performers to say how great the older performers were and use the performers who actually worked at MGM.

B0015ABRE2|3.0|For two seasons, serial killer protagonist Dexter outwitted and outmaneuvered his way through any obstacle, preventing him from quenching his ingrained bloodlust. Numerous flashbacks told the story of how Dexter's cravings came alive, as well as his unique brand of vigilantism: capturing and slaying other murderers.  Predictably, having such a dangerous double life forces Dexter to lie about his entire life, despite his difficulties in masking his lack of emotions and oddball behavior towards loved ones (which includes sister Deb and girlfriend Rita).    Season one nicely established that foundation, and season two expanded the concept to lofty highs.  The possibilities for season three seemed endless, and I couldn't wait to see where Dexter would go next.  Instead, it shows that Dexter's novel premise might be just that: a novelty.     Season three's premise follows yet another chain of events that spurred from Dexter's late night executions.  This time, it involves the death of a district attorney's younger brother, who Dexter stabbed by accident.  The morning after, Miguel Prado (Jimmy Smits), the aforementioned DA, heads over to Miami PD to be more deeply involved in the investigation, and winds up befriending Dexter because of their likeminded interests.      Admittedly, the initial plot promises the same thrills Dexter is known for, and even introduces another prolific serial killer called the Skinner some episodes later.  Alas, what follows feels all too pedestrian, and it reduces Dexter into the lesser realms of procedural crime dramas.      Much of that can be attributed to Dexter's more normalized problems.  Without spoiling a small surprise by the first episode's end, it forces Dexter to re-evaluate his relationship with Rita.  Problem is, compared to Dexter's previous stressors with the Ice Truck Killer and Bay Harbor Butcher cases, his recent problems aren't nearly as compelling.    Another issue is the lack of continuity between seasons two and three.Besides a brief callout of the Bay Harbor Butcher case, there isn't much of a connecting thread bridging the previous episodes.  The new characters in Miami PD, while okay, don't inject much new spark in the already established cast.  Doakes's obvious exclusion also leaves a void.  His antagonistic attitude towards Dexter always crackled tension, and in season two, their combative chemistry really soared into something special.  Deb, a one-note character who blossomed in season two, gets stuck romantically with an assigned PI.  I know Deb's lack of fatherly attention makes her insecure when she has no boyfriend, but surely, after surviving the Ice Truck Killer, she should stand more on her own. Batista and Masuka also get sent down several sideplots of personal affirmation and potential love interests, which all feel more contrived than convincing.    Even the Skinner case never elevates past a sideshow distraction.  While the killer sounds terrifying from witnesses, the writers never properly develop his character, so he's as unmemorable as the case itself.    What does work is Dexter's relationship with Miguel, and it's the only thing levitating season three past mediocrity.  Although some fans accuse Miguel of being Lila 2.0, that only serves to undermine the former character, and his intriguing connection to Dexter.  Yet even with Smits and Hall playing off their respective characters wonderfully and their relationship spurring the moral complexity Dexter is known for, their situation feels startlingly predetermined since episode two. Only twice did the writers throw genuine surprises, but swift, under whelming resolutions stifle them.  When the season finishes, it leaves you yearning for more.    So what went wrong? It's hard to fault the core writing.  The dialogue is as sharp as ever, and the dark humor that keeps Dexter from feeling overly grim is still intact.  However, the writers' tendency to neatly wrap up every single plot thread by the end of each season is beginning to hinder the show.  Each season also follows a pattern of attachment Dexter has towards a key character, and while the characters' personalities' are varied, their journeys don't deviate enough. While it's understandable to resist completely serialized storytelling in this era of TV shows facing instant cancellation, it prevents Dexter from growing and nurturing. Season two did this well, but season three does not do it enough.    What season two also did wonderfully is keep viewers on their toes.  The Bay Harbor Butcher case took Dexter into a wild direction, and even though the twists were random, they were always logical and exciting.  Even Dexter wasn't the same confident killer as before.  He was ambivalent and struggled to stay a step ahead of the FBI, who tried to oust him.  Seeing Dexter in constant weakness and losing control made for fascinating TV, but now, he resolves most of his problems with the intimacy of compiling an Excel spreadsheet.  Befriending Miguel did not challenge Dexter like I hoped, and that hurt the season's unpredictability factor.    Without fresh ideas keeping the show alive, future seasons of Dexter won't sustain the show beyond gimmicks that go nowhere.  Fortunately, there are enough lingering plot threads that could open up new avenues of creativity, and get past the languid spell that bogged down season three.  Otherwise, Dexter might end in a whimper, and that's the worst that could happen to a once promising series.    Lastly, for those of you who already watched season three, unless you really want to re-watch it, I wouldn't buy the DVD set. Based off my experience with the previous Dexter sets and advanced reviews of this one, the extras are barebones at best, and you can search for the Dexter interviews on the internet anyway.  The only justification for the skimp extras is the smaller price, compared to other TV shows on DVD. This will please those who don't care about additional content, but if you do, don't waste your money.

Let me tell you about the Live Seminar which is promoted in the book and which you are invited to go to for free with the coupon in the book.  This T.Harv Eker MIllionaire Mind seminar is a HUGE Waste of Time!!!! I went to check it out as I have done seminars my whole life including many with the great Anthony Robbins, one of the greatest speakers of our time,  Tony Robbins is a master of communication and teaching incredible skills and strategies for anything you want to achieve in life including financial wealth but this T. Harve Eker guy is not!!!....<br /><br />T Harv Eker was only at his seminar for 1/2 a day of the 3 day seminar. When T. Harv did arrive he arrogantly came out on stage as if he was \\"The Man\\" and began to speak.  I found he lacked creating any sort of rapport with the audience and never really connected with us.  He would yell at people in the audience for leaving to go to the bathroom saying they were copping out by not staying in the room. And he would humiliate people with his comments.  Its one thing to movitate someone with pain but what he did was not that at all.  I noticed the audience reaction of getting a little ticked off at the guy's comments as well as people just falling asleep during their hour long sales pitches.  Many participants in the audience had a problem with the guy as they told me so themselves and resented being sold @ 10 times a day during the weekend. I had never been to a seminar where I heard so many bad comments about the speaker before.<br /><br />Now myself I know every phychological sales technique there is and this guy and his staff used them to manipulate and intimidate people to buy more of his books, tapes and seminars yet most of his staff were not millionaires...  The 3 day weekend seminar was a huge sales pitch!  They would reveiw a few things from the book which we already knew then tell you for the next hour to hour and half about some sort of seminar they have. From there they would create a sense of scarcity and fear to manipulate people to run to the back of the room and buy their seminar for a $1,000 - $4,000 or more.  In their sales pitch they would say... we have the most famous or the most well know in the financial area at this seminar to teach you yet they would never tell you the guest speakers names...very secretive. Why?  If I was going to spend $4,000 for a seminar I want to know who is teaching me and if they are so famous and great then telling us who they are will inspire more people to sign up. I found out from someone who went to one of his other seminars that in order to make the money they teach you to make in these other seminars you need to invest money in T.Harv's business recommendations of which I think he most likely makes money from as well. Not sure but it would make sense.<br /><br />I must have been pitched 20 or more different things at this seminar in 3 days. I felt like the whole weekend was a huge waste of my time and I was watching infomercials all weekend.<br /><br /> I got very little out of this weekend seminar for the Millionaire Mind that wasn't in the book. Now, knowing Anthony Robbins material inside out, I noticed much of what was taught at T. Harv's seminar was stolen from Anthony Robbins seminars yet Harv Eker acted as if it as his own.  Even some personal stories seemed to be very similar to Tony Robbins personal stories. Hmmmmm....  Only one thing he taught he gave Anthony Robbins credit for and it was a very elementary thing ( the legs of belief). Everything else was pretty much Robbins work yet done ineffectively by T. Harv from my expert opinion. Even the way the audience was warmed up to the exact stretching sequence routine was Tony Robbins stuff at T. Harv's seminar. Much of the same music was played also. I mean come on that kind of stuff you can switch up.<br /><br />When it was time to do mental imagery, Eker read it from a piece of paper with much of the techniques again were from Anthony Robbins, but Harv and his staff couldn't quite pull them off like Tony. I have done mental imagery with large groups of people and when you know your stuff you don't need a piece of paper to read from. If you have done it so much you have it memorized in your head and you taylor it to your audience.  When reading the imagery exercises of his paper, T. Harv had no emotion in his vocal tone to inspire people into emotion for making the mental changes he wanted from them.  It was unimpressive to say the least.<br /><br />I was completely unimpressed with T.Harv Eker as a speaker. Lots of EGO with this guy which was a turn off to me and believe me I have sat through some poor seminars in the last 30 years so I speak from broad experience.  I was completely disappointed from the man I thought I knew and liked from this good Millionaire Mind book with the real man himself.<br /><br />As a writer, T. Harve Eker is good and he should just stick to that in my opinion and stop ripping off other speakers material and ineffectively appling it in seminar.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on his Millionare Mind seminar. I felt like I should have been compensated for my wasted time and weekend.  As a person who has attended allot of seminars in my life attaining certifications as well with great speakers and teachers such as Anthony Robbins, Deepak Chopra, Wayne Dyer, John Grey, John Bradshaw, Jack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen, Louis Hay, Suzy Orman, Ken Blanchard... I can say from comparison \\"Skip the Millionaire Mind Seminar.\\"  Instead stay home and read the book again! Even better buy those books of the Writers/Speakers I list above and read them!c was played also. I mean come on that kind of stuff you can switch up.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|I just got my hands on a early released copy of Braveheart on Blu-ray from my local Blockbuster Video rental store and the film looks and sounds great. Its transfer to HD surpassed any other I have seen on DVD. Using the MPEG-4 AVC video codec, the video imagery is very sharp without the use of any edge enhancement (or least any I could notice) and the colors are very strong but natural looking. It looks pretty good for being an old movie. The 5.1 Dolby True HD audio is powerful and full during the battle sequences and generally good during the rest of the film. I will definitely purchase this movie on Blu-ray disc once it is released. I recommend it.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|This is definitely Whitney's most personal album to date.  One of the very few efforts that she actually puts the pen to the paper to add her personal input to the music.   If you want to know Whitney's story, it is all here on this CD.  She didn't think she could make it, but she did.  Bobby Brown told her she couldn't do better and she believed it, but she finally realized her own strength.  And she now knows she should've done it long ago. She looks to the Lord for her inspiration and strength. She is not bitter and she is not the type to hold on to the pain, she has moved on and has nothing but love.  She is looking for a new love in her life and having some fun on the dating scene! And so much more.  But it's all right there in the music in a way that anyone who's lived life can relate to.    So, I'm loving the CD so far.  My favorite songs are the more upbeat dance numbers Nothing But Love and For The Lovers. I applaud Whitney for her courage to come back and look adversity in the face.  For every person like myself who roots for the underdog there are probably 5 more who love to see them fail!  So, it's not easy, but in the music she assures listeners that she is ready for whatever life has to offer her from here on out. And for this reason, she is already Victorious.
B001LMU182|5.0|I am an anime freak, own 100s of series - I LOVE this movie, was highly anticipating the blu-ray, but just let me say - Bandai, you suck. I was on preorder for this to get the exclusive first press with the booklet and sleeve. So what do I get 10 weeks LATE? The average-joe version. Definitely NOT worth the $40 I paid.<br /><br />Movie looks and sounds the best it ever has but the total lack of extras - no 20th+ anniversary special extras or anything seems a waste of the blu-ray's capacity and a cheap ca$h grab on Bandai's part.<br /><br />So I am both glad to have it and ticked-off with it at the same time.<br /><br />I would say if you totally love this movie then it is just barely worth it, otherwise just rent it.
B002ID0962|5.0|This is the best single CD Elvis greatest hits collection available. It includes Elvis' biggest hits from the US and UK. All the songs on this set hit number 1 in either the US or UK or both, including the remix of his classic \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" which went to number 1 in the UK (and stayed there for 4 weeks) and several other countries in 2002. This set spans almost his entire career from his first international hit in 1956, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", right on through the last single to be released before his death in 1977, \\"Way Down\\". In between you get classics like \\"Don't Be Cruel\\", \\"Hound Dog\\", \\"All Shook Up\\", \\"Jailhouse Rock\\", \\"Can't Help Falling in Love\\", \\"In the Ghetto\\", \\"Suspicious Minds\\", and \\"Burning Love\\"! Just about every song is a classic.<br /><br />This CD is packaged with a collector's crate and T-shirt (which is why it is priced more than the CD release).  If you want the crate and T-shirt, this is the set you should order.  However, if you are just looking for the CD, you should pass on this set and just get the CD, it is a lot cheaper by itself.
B000NU2CY4|2.0|I rented the early released copies of Gladiator and Braveheart on Blu-ray from my local video store and while Braveheart received top notch treatment in its transfer to Blu-ray, Gladiator did not. It looks like the studio applied a bit too much processing to the film. The film looks a tad bit to bright at times. Also, I immediately noticed very visible halos around the heads of the actors and edges of buildings in the film, indicating that the studio used a bit too much digital sharpening, i.e. edge enhancement, to make the picture look sharper than it probably was in the first place. I further noticed flashes of unnatural color here and there in the film. If there is an upside to the HD transfer of Gladiator it is the HD audio which is very good. Gladiator is a film deserving of a dynamic visual presentation in High Definition. It is a shame the studio did not produce a beautiful transfer, like they did for Braveheart, being that Gladiator is such a great film. It deserves better than this release. I would seriously recommend you rent this version of Gladiator before you decide to buy it.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|A lot of people consider MY LOVE IS YOUR LOVE to be Whitney's best album of the modern era.  Well, I don't share that belief.  The aforementioned is a solid R&B record but I LOOK TO YOU surpasses it without breaking a sweat!!    Standout tracks:  NOTHING BUT LOVE, SALUTE, CALL YOU TONIGHT, WORTH IT, I LOOK TO YOU, and the appropriately titled LIKE I NEVER LEFT.      Great job!!
B000E6GBV2|5.0|If you don't know who Band of Horses is, you soon will.  They are on the verge of huge hugeness.  Nearly every song on Everything All the Time is a gem.  The best part of the album is that it seems to get better with each listen.  You pick out more things, more hidden instruments and sounds.  It is a beautifully rendered gem of an album, one of the few that is universally liked by EVERYONE I know.  If you are a fan of good music, you owe it to yourself to get this album.  Also, get their follow-up, Cease to Begin, while you're at it.
B0013FNC38|4.0|CD is really pretty good.  I had only heard a couple of his songs on the radio when I bought the cd, but I am glad that I bought it.  He has an interesting and varied style of songs within the same cd.  I recommend this cd...you will enjoy  it.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Im a huge MJ fan..I was amazed when I saw this concert in 1992 on HBO and Im even more amazed 17 years later...The set list is wonderful. The effects are astonishing. The dancing is astounding. With musical director and keyboardist Greg Phillinganes brilliance, Ricky Lawson on drums and Siedah Garrett's tremendous background and lead vocals this video is a must own..Did I mention Michael Jackson's performance? No one has even come close to a performance like this one..On his worst day he was better than anyone..I wish more filmed concert from the Dangerous tour or any of his tours were available.. But if this is the only one of his stage spectaculars available on DVD I can live forever with it......To bad HBO felt the need to constantly show the audience but thank goodness they filmed this concert! Sound and picture are both good..No bootleg here.....UPDATE.......After seeing \\"This Is It\\" many times, it now becomes the evolution of the \\"Dangerous\\" tour just as the \\"Bad\\" tour evolved into the \\"Dangerous\\" tour...MJ was a one time gift to the world. Thankfully it was in my lifetime..
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I have never been acquainted with a performer such as Celine Dion. She is truly a talented singer and this concert proves that. I would highly recommend this DVD to anybody who is a Celine fan. It is worth the price and for all you who aren't fans...let's just say that she will make you a believer. ;)
B002FA5NNW|5.0|I LOVED the movie! Saw it twice in the theater.<br />I bought the DVD from Amazon. This DVD has NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!!!<br />Still, it is a beautiful movie. Hopefully I will be able to exchange it.<br />We'll see how customer service works here.............
0743290127|1.0|I think this is the first bad review I have written on Amazon, but this book definitely deserves it.  I first saw it at my local Sam's for around $10, but got a used copy here at Amazon.  Glad I did not waste much money.  This is a complete waste of money and time for any reader.  What a disappointment coming after Lauren's \\"The Devil Wears Prada.\\"<br /><br />I often wonder how books like this (and movies!) get out the door when they are clearly trash.
0060005696|5.0|I loved this book! I even bought a second copy since I gave the first one to a friend. It was an eye opener for me for a lot of things. Most of the conclusions may seem simple and self evident, but we don't think about them regularly and fall in the trap of spending too much time making decisions and then regretting the choice. In the decision making process simple and good enough is better than perfect.
0812580346|2.0|A good idea, but handled wrong.  Much of it isn't very believable, and I've read some pretty far-out stuff that was made believable by skilled authors.  The characters are definitely cardboard cutouts, as many other reviewers have stated.  I'm not even sure the author had a clear idea who they were.  (You get the idea that Lloyd Simcoe is generally reserved/timid in the beginning of the book, but then later on he walks out on a press conference, unflustered, saying something like, \\"That's it.  I'm outta here.\\"  I think I laughed out loud at that.)  The dialogue is just sad, and there's very little action.  The writing is pretty terrible too, with cliches littered here and there---and a decent editor was certainly called for.<br /><br />I thought the concept was good.  But, as I said, the execution was poor.  I would have liked to have seen how everyday citizens reacted to their future visions, and how they tried to change them or help them come to fruition.  Less pseudoscience, more fiction.
0374139563|5.0|It is a well written book which explains in easy words the reasons of the decline of Africa. The pathological  mechanisms of local economy are well described. I think that everyone who has contacts with african nations and will help them in the growth should read this book  Massimo Vaghi
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This is as great as the first 2 seasons of Dexter - The best series on TV for years.  Superb writing, a great cast, and Dexter himself is simply 'the guy'.  This will not disapoint.  You don't need to have seen previous seasons to understand this one although it will make for better viewing.  A thrilling season from start to finish.
0385341008|4.0|A delightful book set primarily on the island of Guernsey, it tells how they survived Nazi occupation while entertaining us with a good story at the same time.
B001993Y2C|4.0|I never got the chance to see the series in HD, so buying the entire collection at this price was a great value.  The only downside is that I wish there was more behind-the-scenes footage and interviews included, but then it'd be a 40 disc set instead of 20.  The only downside is the packaging.  I wish the box was smaller but you can remove the 4 individual season boxes for each and place them on the shelf.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Love Michael Jackson!  But how could they forget 2 critical MJ songs on this collection - \\"Lady In My Life\\" and \\"Liberian Girl\\"?  I was shocked to not see these songs on any of the discs.  Other than that, a fantastic collection.  Rest in Peace MJ!  You shall never be forgotten!
B001QB9H10|5.0|Great movie with lots of non-stop action and good story line. I would recommend it to anyone who like action flicks.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|As a Star Trek original series fan for many years, I, too, went into this with an open mind, and must admit I thought it was, overall, fun. But where I really get hung up, and what I really cannot (will not?) accept, is the revisionist history of this \\"enterprise.\\" Keep the action, keep the cast, keep the early years, keep the green girl, but I wish they had not decided to get into the wayback machine for a do-over. What's next, \\"The Search for Spocks?\\" Can't say I'll be buying this one. Maybe I'll rent it, just to give it another look.
031606792X|3.0|This is technically a spoiler review, so dont read if you want to know the ending.    Um, it was a fine book. I personally think the amount of time spent on her pregnancy was a bit much (taking up about half the middle of the book). I also think there were too many \\"saving the day\\" moments with the Volturi. I personally think anything over 3 is enough. The saving grace happening became a bit exhausting by the time they got to it. Oh! The day is saved, oh, no it isn't. Wait it is! Oh, no it isn't. And really, the baby and Jacob? I did like what happened after the birth though, with Bella. Though i didn't like all the keeping her away from the baby on her first visit. Again, cruel drama. Need Happy sometimes. Life can't always be an overwhelming issue.     I know Im being critical. I was happy to get an ending to the saga and I couldn't put the book down a lot (I lost a lot of sleep) but some parts just slowed the book down and had a bit too much unnessesary drama for me. I wished for more happy moments actually. It was all very... I guess dramatic and anxiety ridden. I totally recommend reading it if only to see the ending of the book. It was still a great ending, even if some people say it was too happy an ending overall/made everything work out. What's wrong with that, I say? :) So yea. Go for it. Make up your own mind.
B001BGTWXI|3.0|I love the hard stuff and Slipknot can always be counted on to bring the pain. About half the songs on here are really hard, some even remind me of the first album. Some of the other songs on here don't belong on here and should probably be on Corey's other band Stone Sour albums. If you are looking for something hard that makes you want to destroy the world, then get Slipknot's first two albums. Sickness.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I received package in great time. Plays wonderfully. No complaints. Would buy from them again.
031606792X|3.0|I had such expectations on this one, based on my thrilling experiences with the first three Twilight-books. Honestly, for the past two weeks (when I started reading the first book) I have been in a Twilight fog. All I could think about was Bella and Edward and I even caught myself hoping for a vampire boyfriend myself (I'm 27, so that's kind of weird). And then I read the fourth book...     It is not that its bad, cause it really isn't. I just think that when the story is twisted to Jacobs perspective it just doesn't meet up to the other books. I would have preferred a narrator in all books. But after getting used to seeing everything from Bella's perspective it just got strange to see it from Jacob's.    Also I think that the story got a little out of hand. I'm not the biggest fantasy fan and while the other books where on the right side of my line of acceptable fantasy, Breaking Dawn slides over from time to time.     To sum it up, the book was good but  I had learn to expect more based on the previous fantastic ones.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This is a brilliant production. Watching the DVD lifted my spirits.  I listen to the CD in my car and know most of the words now. I plan to order more to give as gifts.
1416955070|5.0|i very much enjoyed this book,if you like demons,vampires and other things that go bump in the night this book is for you.
B001EJYOBM|5.0|Other than the fact that it is Steelbook there is nothing different about this version versus the normal one. The packaging on this one is way cooler though. Great show and I wish that it had at least gotten a third season to wrap things up a bit more. When I got this it was only $30, but it was a limited release. Cool to see that there are still a few available. Season 2 is coming out in Steelbook as well and I already have it pre-ordered.
1416914307|3.0|the first two books of this series were good,but the storie of jace and clary and there friends started getting old,i found the caracters whiney and they got annoying fast(the ohh poor me crap and ohhh but i love him/her)ok so romance isnt my thing lol,but if you liked the \\"twilight\\" series you will like this one to.honest its not a bad read,it has lots of action and is a very good story,just needed to cut back on the mushy poor me crap.and i would recomend this book to others that i know like action/romance type books
B000H0MKO2|5.0|Aaron Eckhart is fast becoming one of my favorite actors to watch (The Dark Night and Conversations with Other Women both showcase his talent) but my interest started with his excellent portrayal of a lobbyist for the tobacco industry in this great movie.<br />It's hard to find fault in Thank You For Smoking. It features an intelligent script, sharp and disciplined acting, and smooth yet brisk pacing. There are plenty of laughs, a perfect dose of heart, and a filleting of not only the lobby world, but of government, Hollywood, power, and the gullible American public that is surgically precise. There are no punches pulled here, Eckhart leads a brilliant cast of actors and Thank You For Smoking is easily one of the best satire comedies I have seen in a long time. When you look at how much praise Tropic Thunder got for trying (unsuccessfully) to pull off the same skewering satire, it should make you appreciate a gem like TYFS that much more. This is highly recommended.
1416972242|4.0|city of ashes was a very good read,if your into the supernatural.I would recomend this book,the only bad thing i can say about it is the caracters can get boreing,and the story of clary and jace gets old fast.but it has enough action in it to keep you wanting to read more.
B00077F948|3.0|My brother, who is a accomplished guitarist himself, told me that John Williams is THE king of classical guitar. Being so excited by his recommendation, I bought this CD immediately. But having listened to this CD, I had mixed feelings. Williams' playing is technically rock-solid and impeccable, but the machine-like precision of his playing dominates here and many of the pieces sound too clinical and somewhat soul-less. Listen, for example to his cool rendition of El Ultimo Tremolo. It is beautifully and sensitively played, yet it fails to convey the sense of longing and the nostalgic poignancy of the music. If Williams is the king of guitar, the art of guitar playing still has got a long way to go in terms of musicality and tonal expression!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|Step up came to movies in Brasil, so when was in august of 2008 and I saw the videoclip from Killa - Cherish, and saw flashes of step up 2 started to look for the film, and discovered that it wouldn't came to the movies in Brasil. Too sad... The only way to see, was wait almost a month for the DVD from Amazon, but I don't regret, the movie is wonderful, the dance is perfect and Robert Hoffman... I don't have enough words to describe!
0307266303|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  It presents a really interesting paradigm shift in running culture.  I would highly recommend this book, if nothing else it is a fun read!
1416594884|4.0|I don't think anyone would realistically expect LeCarre to re-ascend the hieghts of his golden years and, yes, there has been a 'dip' lately. However I felt that this is his best book for a long time. It certainly stands head and shoulders over any other political thriller I have read which has been released in the last year or two.   One hopes this the start of a LeCarre silver age.
0307266303|5.0|I bought this book for my brother, who runs.  I decided to take a look at it myself and then could not put it down.  An amazing story including sociology, anthropology, biology and physiology.    I recommend to anyone anyone looking for a good book!
B001684L0A|5.0|Before seeing the mini series John Adams, READ THE BOOK.  It reads more like a great novel than a biography.   Then, by all means see this beautiful telling of our country's founding and of this great man.  The dignity and sacrifice of Mr. Adams, and the men who birthed the freedom that we precariously guard today, is something to behold.  And, as always, Playtone and HBO spared no expertise in the crafting of this stunning series.
1400034779|4.0|Fabulously fat Precious Ramotswe, a thirty-five year old Christian Botswanan woman, sets up a detective agency with proceeds from the inheritance her kind, loving, level-headed father accumulated. She hires a skilled secretary and waits. Soon, a small but steady stream of customers comes calling. Mma Ramotswe's sleuthing skills are as unconventional as they are effective, which is why, by the end of the book, business is near booming. The Ladies' No. 1 Detective Agency, with its wide-ranging, always engaging characters, is the first installment in a really good, easy reading, detective series set in Africa. Readers are likely to find Mms Ramotswe, with her kind, overachieving, commonsensical ways and adoration for Africa, endearing and her character traits (relationship with Note aside) admirable. The next two books in the series (which is as far as I've read) are just as entertaining. Also good: Don't Let's Go to the Dogs Tonight by Alexandra Fuller, Graceland by Chris Abani, and Fever! By John Grant Fuller.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|As a native Long Islander the only thing I can say bad about this movie is it did not take place on Long Island.  Besides that, this movie was great. Start to finish it was just a good film.  Each actor played their character perfectly.  They are all believable and genuine which makes the story that much better. While the movie is pitched as a comedy it is way deeper than your traditional comedy.  If you are looking for the second Superbad you will not find it here.  However, this movie does have to offer great laughs just of a different kind of humor.  Some dry, some slapstick but either way this movie is funny. The deep storyline takes it to the next level which makes the movie that much better.     Mottola did a great job with this film as did the actors who starred in it.
1439152756|5.0|This book was great.  I have a friend with this condition and it really taught me a lot. I read it in three days because I could not put it down.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|I was very pleased with this item.  I'm living overseas and haven't got to see the more recent episodes.  Amazon not only shipped it overseas but it also arrived sooner than expected.  The season itself was also very good.  :o)
B000065R29|3.0|Nice music,nice performing, nice -yeah, beautiful actors- and a feature lacks of something anyway as \\"Additional scenes\\" in DVD Extras testify to.<br /><br />Up till date, [[ASIN:B0002X7GZ2 Happy Together]]is the best work of Kar Wai-Wong, believe it or not to!
B000S88JTS|5.0|I love the DVD, it's a classic and always fun to watch! It took way too long for it to arrive in the mail
1402720602|5.0|As a Luthier, I read many articles and books on guitar making. This book is by far the most complete on the subject. Well written and well presented. A budding luthier will surely appreciate this book. It just does not get any better then this one. Especially the associated pictures.
0765322889|4.0|I'm a huge fan of epic fantasy and the darker grittier stuff like the Black Company series really interests me.  I've read about the Malazan books for years but never really had the room in my book queue for them until now.  I wish I had read this book years ago.    I will say it starts out slow.  Actually I take that back, it starts out so quickly that it takes forever to get your head about you and immerse yourself in the universe.  I'm all for mystery at the beginning of a book to draw you in but there are so many players and so many plot lines that it makes for a bit of a confusing read at the beginning.  However as soon as the setting moved to Darujhistan it cleared up a little, developed the characters and turned into a great read with a lot of unique ideas.  I was drawn in to each character's story, and with as many characters and separate stories as there are in this book, that's pretty amazing.  This is definitely a more adult read than many fantasy stories because you'll need to keep a lot of plot twists in your head.  I'd recommend it to anyone who wants something a little more gritty and intelligent than your standard high fantasy.
B001QOGY72|4.0|In \\"Taking Woodstock,\\" director Ang Lee sweetly adapts Elliot Tiber's memoir of the same name to tell a small coming-of-age tale amidst the larger backdrop of the behind the scenes coming together of the 1969 Woodstock Music Festival at Yasgur's farm in upstate New York after town residents of the original venue in Wallkill passed a law banning the gathering of over 5000 people without the appropriate permit.  Possessing a permit to sponsor a small music and arts festival at the site of his parents' rundown motel, El Monaco, Tiber a.k.a Teichberg, immediately contacted concert organizers Michael Lang and Artie Kornfield and the rest, as they say, is history.<br /><br />Billed as \\"three days of peace and music\\" meant to heal a nation suffering from the ongoing effects of the Vietnam War and the aftershock of the assignations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Woodstock historically served its purpose for the hundreds of thousands that participated.  Like America of that time period, Lee's main character Elliot (an unassuming and quickly forgotten Demetri Martin), hears a clarion call of his own; after living openly in Greenwich Village as a gay male, he must hide his sexual orientation from his Holocaust survivor parents when he moves back to Bethel, New York to save their motel.  Now he must bite the bullet, rebuke the excuse of handling his parents and their issues and find a life of his own.<br /><br />Lee's theme toys with different ideas of freedom whose apt anthem is the opening concert piece by Richie Havens.  For Elliot's mother (played with an almost Gestapo intensity by Imelda Staunton,) it materializes in the form of thousands of hoarded banknotes signifying the security of which she has always dreamed.  The senior Teichberg (Henry Goodman) finds enjoyment in a newfound energy generated by the `young people' that invade the town, listen to his life stories and applaud his functional gravitas. The preparation, three days and aftermath heal lost Vietnam vet Billy (Emile Hirsch), allow Marine cross-dresser Vilma (Liev Schreiber) to control his confused life for a limited amount of time while assuming an oracle role to the other misfits this film brings together, and provide the westward-ho direction for a newly enlightened and empowered Elliot.  Once again, it takes a village . . .<br /><br />. . . of which some of its inhabitants border on the stereotypical or add nothing to the film other than to provide an entire entourage of sixties characters complete with an [[ASIN:B000CRR3JW Oh! Calcutta!]] type theatre group that revels in their nudity, a couple of acid droppers in a old VW bus decorated with requisite kaleidoscopic ceiling graphics and angry burgeoning feminists intent on a ritual bra-burning.  All of which add layer upon layer onto a fairly satisfying 40 year old glimpse of reality that Lee obviously took pains to achieve.<br /><br />All of the extras look as if they are from that era with their emphasis on untamed manes of hair (shades of [[ASIN:0792841638 Hair]]) free of any of the meticulous grooming products so prevalent now--the skinny dipping scenes emphasis this most of all with their blatant display of non-depilatoried body hair suggesting the feral freedom of Rousseau's noble savage so prevalent to that mindset.<br /><br />Concentrating wholeheartedly on reconstructing his main character's microcosm, Lee steers the storyline away from an emphasis on the concert itself, offering only a hilltop vantage point of the stage with its undulating sea of people that pulses and glows from the perspective of an acid trip.  Healing, indeed as are other signs of the time--peace signs, tie dye, fringed vests, floppy leather hats, tokes of maryjane and gobbles of hash brownies.<br /><br />Bottom line:  Ang Lee does a nice job of depicting upstate New York in the late sixties when Woodstock came to town.  Instead of concentrating on the concert and its music, he tells a smaller tale of family salvation fueled by the material wealth the festival brought with it and the Age of Aquarian ideals that bespoke a new millennium of desired peace and the main character's self-acceptance.  Some stereotypes reign along with a rather weak lead by Demetri Martin, but Lee pulls it off like the pro he is, recreating a nice facsimile of the venue and its time.  Many of the film's references (i.e. organizer Lang's hopeful plans to head to San Francisco refer to the role he played in putting together the Altamont Music Festival where the a chapter of Hell's Angels hired to run security ended up stabbing and killing someone and beating up a lot of hippies with pool cues and the Judy Garland record played in the El Monaco bar supposedly refers to the Stonewall riots in Greenwich village, heralding the beginning of the Gay Liberation Movement) needed at least textual explanations for those unfamiliar with the era and its incendiary history. Recommended--however, if you want to hear the music, buy the CD [[ASIN:B00274SHKM Music from the Original Soundtrack and More: Woodstock]] or watch the documentary[[ASIN:B001V9LRV0 Woodstock: 3 Days of Peace & Music Director's Cut (40th Anniversary Ultimate Collector's Edition with Amazon Exclusive Bonus Disc)]].<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\"t with it and the Age of Aquarian ideals that bespoke a new millennium of desired peace and the main character's self-acceptance.

B001AQTWF2|4.0|I would like to start by saying, I love Whitney.  I am an avid fan.  However, one must admit her albums are not always that impressive.  Quality of individual songs is another story.  Whitney usually releases albums with much filler and a few outstanding cuts.  The total album sucks, but those ballads that tugged at your soul that were record setting was what made her phenomenal.  The thing about Look to You is.. this album has less filler.. but only ok songs..  Nothing is outstanding or heart wrenching..  Still this album is on repeat.. but.. there is nothing really memorable about it.. except for the fact that.. Whitney is back!

B000ZEE3I6|3.0|This remarkably well balanced series of wildly successful films based on an equally popular series of novels by J. K. Rowling shows no signs of waning with Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.  Potter veteran director David Yates and keeper of the flame scribe Steve Kloves have kept together a burgeoning franchise that is laying the foundation for a grand finale.      A new school year begins, and Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is coming to terms with being the `chosen one' to do battle against the ultimate in evil wizardry, Lord Voldemort and the evil Death Eaters surrounding Hogwart.  Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) enlists Harry to serve as bait to draw out the supremely evil Voldemort.  An older Professor Slughorn (Jim Broadbent) returns to the school and brings with him a mysterious history of having taught the boy who became Lord Voldemort.  Harry in the meantime discovers a manuscript by the `Half-Blood Prince' and thinks that it is the key to learning the wizardry secret that will enable Harry and his comrades, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) to defeat the man who killed his parents and godfather, Sirius Black.  Harry's school rival Draco harbors revenge against him for the death of his evil father.  There is the aerial game Quidditch that challenges Ron's mettle, and the blossoming of adolescent romance between Potter and Ron's sister, Ginny and between Ron and  Hermione.  Then there is Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) and some mysterious behavior that questions his allegiance.  As Dumbledore makes Harry promise to do whatever he instructs, the Death Eaters are unleashed within Hogwart with devastating consequences and a shocking betrayal that will forever change the destiny of the school and foreshadow the coming showdown with Voldemort.      This is a more grownup Potter as it explores relationships more thoroughly and some amusing situations arise such as a love triangle that plagues Ron.   It is amusing to see how hormones are thriving amongst the teens and love is in the air.  Growing up was never this hard. There are also surprises of a high order that will send the series on a new, ominous path while raising questions about the loyalty of a major player. The one constant is our beloved trio of maturing wizards who must face an uncertain future without an important character.   The film reinforces the continuous themes of loyalty and friendship among our wizard heroes.  That bond and natural chemistry among the three actors is partly what holds this remarkable series together.      Most of the characters are back from the previous film Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.  It does feel like school has restarted when Professors Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall (venerable Maggie Smith) show up.  Other familiar faces reappear, which greatly help in the continuity and progression of the story.  The filmmakers are wise to introduce a couple new characters here and there without shaking up the status quo too much.  All the Potter films have benefited from a strong focus on storyline in keeping with the novel sources.    Production values are topnotch again, and the dark, moody colored cinematography is an artistic triumph. It is impressive at how mainstream films have pushed the creative aspects of filmmaking without sacrificing popularity; witness the cinematography and art direction of The Dark Knight and the film editing in The Bourne Ultimatum.  It has almost become passé to expect imaginative state of the art special effects in the Potter films, but they are always serving the plot and not merely to draw attention to the spectacle itself.     Since these are British performers, there is a bit of adjusting to their heavy British accents.  This film, perhaps more than any other, assumes that the audience is already well versed on Potter lore, and so it may prove a bit confusing to the uninitiated.  It starts out well and tries one's patience just a tad as it builds a complex narrativethat loses steam half-way through and picks up momentum toward the end and never lets up with a devastating payoff which in turn sets up the two part finale in grand fashion.     Though not the best film of the series, The Half-Blood Prince sets the table for the final battle of good versus evil.  This must be a pretty good film because I can't wait for the final installments.

B001OQCV9M|4.0|Take equal parts Meryl Streep and Amy Adams.  Add a dash of Stanley Tucci and have chef/director Nora Ephron whip up a delicious patisserie of confectionary delight in the true tale, Julie & Julia.  Combining two source books, Julie Powell's Julie & Julia and Julia Child's My Life in France, Ephron's screen adaptation parallels the lives of up and coming master chef Child and aspiring writer Powell who uses Child's cookbook as the inspiration for her ambitious blog.  The results, while not a five star meal, is certainly an entertaining, well acted drama highlighted by some amusing situations.    Two married women from different times and places yearn to satisfy their inner desire for independence.  In 1949, Julia Child and her US civil servant husband, Paul, are stationed in Paris, France.  Wanting to do something besides sitting around like other wives of the period, she endeavors a variety of classes from hat making to bridge lessons until she and Paul hit upon the fact that she loves to eat.  Thus she embarks on a mission to conquer cooking schools and the art of culinary cuisine.  In 2002, with similar desires for a more fulfilling life as an author, Julie Powell is getting adjusted to Queens, New York, with her husband, Eric.   Powell's frustrations are channeled into a blog that documents her attempts to realize all 524 recipes in Julia Child's famous cookbook in 365 days no less.  The two lead characters depend on the publishing world for success-Child with her constantly delayed French cookbook manuscript that grows to 700 pages and the doubting responses of skeptical publishers, and Julie with her daily blogs as her way of garnering attention from a publisher.  Both women's lives are set on a journey of self discovery and validation as they find that their goals will be sprinkled with adversity and roadblocks.  Ultimately it will be their sheer will, self reflection, and the love of their respective spouses that will see them through in their quests.      Streep is perhaps the best actress of the past thirty years and this role only serves to elevate her status. Although the role is not a tortured soul as in Sophie's Choice or Kramer vs. Kramer, she embodies Child as a larger than life bon vivant while mimicking her voice and mannerisms with startling acumen and enthusiam.   Child's character gets more development than Powell.  As she walks with Paul, her subtle reaction to a baby carriage and subsequent meltdown at the news of her sister's pregnancy is an interesting revelation.  Her love of French food becomes an avocation and her life's calling.  The cooking moments are convincing including a cute sequence involving chopped onions that will have audiences chuckling.   She is a woman's libber by default as she attends a more advanced, male dominated cooking class.       It's a pity that any actor in a Streep film would suffer by comparison.   Yet Adams throws herself in the more contemporary but less developed role with gusto.  Her role is more of the everywoman who cooks as a form of therapy.  Powell's background can't quite compete with the rich history of Child's origins, but what she does get is a following and respect from fans and publishers.  What Ephron should have done toward the end is to reemphasize how Powell's inability to finish anything of merit has come full circle with this accomplishment and would have provided a more compelling character development.    Stanley Tucci is a standout who more than holds his own with Streep's Child.  It is an Oscar-worthy performance.   Chris Messina is a star on the rise as Eric Powell; he performs well with an essentially one note role.       There are nice moments including an amusing scene when Julie and Eric watch Dan Aykroyd's classic Saturday Night Live take on Julia Child.  A subplot involving the House Un-American Activities Committee detracts from the overall spirit of Child's story, and the film does slow a bit in the last half-hour but never loses interestcompletely.   Ephron does well by linking similar themes and events that each woman experiences thus providing a bond and segue over time and space.  One wishes that there was a more direct connection between the two women and even a chance meeting, but we have to settle for indirect links and the sharing of kindred spirits.      Don't expect anything more than an interesting character study of two women bound by a love for food and search for purpose in their lives.  Julie & Julia is light but satisfying fare highlighted by a sumptuous main course, Meryl Streep.  Bon appetite!

B001KVZ6FM|5.0|Pixar has found a home with Disney and, with apologies to Dreamworks and other animation studios, no one has come close in recent years to their fresh, inventive, and importantly, timeless spirit in computer animation.  In UP, a tale of loneliness and friendship is told in a simple, heartfelt way.  This is one of the best films of the year and puts live action films to shame.    Carl begins as an adventure-loving boy whose childhood friendship with a girl, Ellie, grows into a marriage as adults and a dream to visit their ideal destination, Paradise Falls in South America.   Later widowed, Carl becomes a crusty, elderly man who longs for escape. In time, his neighborhood is transformed into an urban development, and one fateful day with the threat of being committed to a retirement community, he takes his house on a bold, unlikely trip by balloons through the skies to South America.  Unfortunately, he discovers an accidental passenger in the form of a Boy Scout named Russell who is looking to get his final merit badge by helping a senior citizen.  Carl must make a momentous decision that changes his life and affects Russell.  Their joint flight arrives somewhere in the vicinity of Paradise Falls.  Along the way they encounter an unusual, giant bird dubbed Kevin and a dog named Dug whose thoughts are vocalized through his special electronic collar.  This motley group encounters a mysterious, dangerous presence that threatens them and jeopardizes Carl's journey to his final destination.     Pete Docter (Wall-E, Toy Story) and Bob Peterson (Finding Nemo) bring their story and screenplay talents to the fore as co-directors.  It's really a story about unfulfilled, broken dreams and things left undone, and the spirit and drive to recapture those feelings.  The film begins with a subplot involving the friendship and growing romance of a young Carl and Ellie who share a passion for life and adventure.  The imaginative vignettes tell a complete love story in an opening montage that ends as our film is only beginning-wow!      What makes this film head and shoulders above most animations is its poignant confrontation of life's ups and downs.  It's about life and death told in terms that are not disingenuous.  In the grand tradition of Disney classics as Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, movies about finding a safe place from danger are at the core of children's animation, and this film plays on that tradition.  The novelty here is that the lead character is elderly.  There is a sense of The Wizard of Oz in its otherworldly journey of discovery and camaraderie, and even the climax smacks of Saturday morning cliffhangers.   A nice change of pace is the lack of contemporary, inside jokes or puns based on pop culture that are staples of such Dreamworks hits as the Shrek films.  The situations here are organically amusing from natural conflicts and plot.    Carl (voiced to perfection by Edward Asner) is a mean, bitter soul who rediscovers his innocence and humanity through Russell, who in turn discovers the safety of a nuclear family with Carl and some unlikely companions.  Kevin is cute, emanating amusing sound effects and body movements without uttering a single line of dialogue.  Dug is a riot as the misfit dog whose heart of gold is matched by his incessant habit of having his `talking' interrupted at any moment by a sudden spasm of posturing and shouting, \\"point\\" or \\"squirrel\\"! It's a hoot.  Christopher Plummer is effectively sinister as a blast from the past.  The only criticism of the movie is minor at the end when we are not quite sure about Russell's parents and how much they are part of his life.  John Ratzenberger's (Cheers) streak of doing a voice in every major Pixar release is intact.    The computer animation is so good, that anything not human looks like a picturesque postcard.  When Carl's balloons sprout above his house, we admire their stunning, vibrant colors.  Interesting uses of cinematography are employed as ifthis were a live action feature.  The final image is ironic as it is iconic, a fitting end to a fairy tale.      This one ranks highly alongside Pixar favorites like Finding Nemo and Wall-E.  Quite possibly, adults may find as much (if not more) to enjoy in this story.  It's amazing that a modest story featuring a kid and old man told with conviction and skill is one of the best films of 2009.

B00168OIOE|5.0|I think that the whole delay is because they're including something else. Previously the info about the package said it was gonna be a 3-Discs edition and now it says it will be 4 discs.<br /><br />Here at Costa Rica, you can get the 3 Discs Bluray version, with English, French and Spanish audio which includes 2 blurays (one of the movie, and one with extras) and disc 3 is the movie on DVD.<br /><br />I really don't see the point about including a DVD with the movie if you're getting the same movie on bluray, but I guess is just another way to charge more. I guess 4 disc on the version at amazon will feature a digital copy of  the movie.<br /><br />I hope is something else than a digital copy disc, because having all you people waiting months and months just for that, I think is not quite fair; specially since the bluray is already available. Also Latin America blurays are zone A just like  USA and Canada, therefore I don't see the point for such delay on Amazon or North America.<br /><br />Maybe Disney is trying to make more money out of you for the holidays, so think about that!

B001AQTWF2|4.0|At a time when producers rely on modern technological advances to get the sound required for a blockbuster hit, it's refreshing the hear that Whitney Houston's comeback album is, for the most part, tastefully done.  Whether going for a classic, retro sound or an upbeat R&B vibe, this record manages to avoid extremes while keeping things fresh enough so that our younger music lovers might catch on to one of history's greatest female voices.    Whitney, legendary hit-maker Clive Davis and the songwriters (including some of today's hottest artists) combine for an effort that can appeal to young and old alike, with judicious use of synthesizers, drum machines, and vocal special effects for some tracks and classic recording techniques for others (the ballads \\"I Look To You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" sound just like they used to).    Towards the end of the album especially, modern sounds and recording techniques do play a bigger role, but all the collaborations seem to work without going overboard...and most importantly, they make sure Whitney's vocal is still the centerpiece.      While every song is not the greatest ever written, the material is generally above average regardless of its specific genre or style...the aforementioned ballads are still Whitney's strength, and her voice sits beautifully in some of the best reverb effects I've heard in quite some time.  Likewise, the musical arrangements on those tunes are simply breathtaking.  Overall, this is one very good record...and better than I had expected.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|Fantastic!  The songs, the dancing, the choreography, the music, the musicians, the lighting, the stagecraft . . . this is a great concert conceived by the one and only Michael Jackson.  When he asked if he could come down into the audience (while singing \\"She's Out of My Life\\") . . . and the crew produced a pretty girl to come up on stage . . . well, those are theatrics, by a master.   And the ending of the concert is beyond reality.  Well worth the price to have in your forever collection.

B000TX7B5U|5.0|If you look up \\"genius\\" in a dictionary, there, you would see Serj's face. \\"Elect The Dead\\" is nothing short of spectacular. It was such a pleasure to experience a record that was truly Serj Tankian. He was able to follow and take the direction of where he specifically wanted his music to go... from writing, arranging, and producing all the songs. And as a result, what we have here is sheer brilliance. From beginning to end, the album does not falter whatsoever. You are engaged with the music, the lyrics, the entire time. The lyrics, especially, is something to really delve yourself into. They're deep, meaningful and mature. \\"Elect The Dead\\" is a masterclass that should be heard by all.
0061231401|3.0|As I read this book, I wondered why the characterization was So matter-of-fact and almost like it should've been obvious I knew who the hell these characters were and what was going on. Needless to say, I continued to read because it was a good page turner filled with action. As I read on, I wondered if Rollins had a thing for people making out, because the first few chapters everyone's tongue was in someone else's mouth at least once. And then I go online to place a review and find out that \\"Doomsday Key\\" is part of a series...ha...that explains it. Despite the very small clues which I never picked up on until now, I would've never guessed this was a series. As a novel in a series I'm sure it makes more sense. As a stand alone novel, it is entertaining and thrilling at best, but like i said the characters and the introduction of Sigma are hollow. Conversations and character introduction don't go very deep to help a new Sigma reader understand the forces driving them. So while this was a very good novel in a series, as a stand alone it sort of leans.
B000003TAR|4.0|I used to have this on cassette, and the first side of this album is perfect. It sounds like they wanted to take grunge to the next level, and make this one even more lo-fi sounding than \\"Nevermind\\". \\"Serve The Servants\\" is an underrated song that should've gotten some airplay on the radio. I only heard it once on 98 Rock a Tampa station, then a song I originally thought as a weak song \\"Scentless Apprentice\\" shows it's a competent song. \\"Heart Shaped Box\\" was the big hit on the radio down here in Central Florida, but the song that got it pulled from Walmart has also been getting airplay down here called \\"Rape Me\\". Then comes my favorite song on the album \\"Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle\\" Cobain's favorite actress was Frances Farmer who was wild lady of the late 30's-early 40's, and when she couldn't control her partying she was committed to a asylum where she wound up getting a lobotomy which changed her forever, and she died in 1970 at the age of 56. \\"Dumb\\" is just there. Side 2 I originally thought that this was where the album fell apart as it was nothing but noise with Cobain shrieking, and it was drenched in feedback and distortion. However, after sampling the second side I found it to actually be a good side. \\"Going Ape\\" kicks off side 2, and then follows with
1416550542|5.0|I very much enjoyed this story, so much so that I couldn't put it down. It's the story of a mysterious little girl who arrives in Australia all alone, apparently abandoned. She is adopted by a kindly dockmaster and his wife, and she lives her entire life in Australia. After her death, her granddaughter, Cassandra, traces this little girl back to England and finally discovers the truth. Very engrossing story all the way to the ending. Highly recommended.
B0017R5UAA|4.0|\\"White Winter Hymnal\\" is the obvious hook that gets you in, and very snazzy it is too, but being so repetitive, I suspect they may get sick of playing it in every encore for the rest of their lives. \\"He Doesn't Know Why\\" is another highlight, with some of the strongest lyrics on the album, and the most propulsive scansion since R.E.M.'s \\"Diminished\\". The only problem for me with this one is what the harmonies (lovely though they may be) are doing in such an anguished song - they seem to dilute, rather than add to, its emotional power.     \\"Your Protector\\" builds up a terrific head of steam, and then gets bogged down and loses interest a bit (\\"Tell your [insert family member here] [insert random lyric here]\\", etc. etc.) So do the more ambitious prog suites like \\"Ragged Wood\\" (\\"lie with me if you will/at the top of Beringer Hill\\") and \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" (\\"in the quivering forest/where the shivering dog rests\\"), so I think this is a problem with their songwriting they'll need to work on. The impenetrable lyrics on these ones don't help. (What is \\"Blue Ridge Mountains\\" about? Gay incest?) The simpler tracks like \\"Sun It Rises\\" and \\"Heard Them Stirring\\" work just fine.     But the standout track for me is \\"Tiger Mountain Peasant Song\\". I love everything about this - the medieval string waltz, the way the rhymes don't follow the metre, the repeating four-chord motif, the evocative lyrics, and the way he starts to channel Arthur Lee at the end when he's turning into a demon. Worth the price of admission for this one alone. What's with the title - is it a Brian Eno reference?
B000001GK0|2.0|This has to be one of the most heavy-handed performances of these concertos that I have ever heard. The pianist periodically throws in dotted rests and rubato that aren't anywhere in the score. I suppose in order to add a \\"deeply personal emotional emphasis\\" to the music. Instead, it just breaks the melodic flow of these sublime pieces of music. Meanwhile, von Karajan is beating mercilessly on the orchestra in an effort to get through everything as quickly as possible -- perhaps he's bored and would rather be doing something else.    The overall effect is more like a wonky version of John Philip Sousa than Schumann and Grieg. I really regret having bought this CD, but I will at least have the joy of feeding it into a shredder.
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|It was well worth the wait, twenty some-odd years later. The vision of the book was captured perfectly and the acting was up to snuff. Costuming and SFX well above what was expected.

The first few times I tried it I couldn't finish all the excercises and I was dripping with sweat. Even now after a couple months of doing this I still build up a good sweat and some days have trouble finishing some of the exercises on level 3 and 2.

Edie Eckman teaches you how to start crochet motifs, how to add color and finish off neatly.  I love experimenting with granny square motifs, but found them a bit limited.  This book will help expand my horizons.  The motifs include circles, squares, triangles, hexagons.  The photos are beautiful and the instructions are clear and easy to follow. Endless possibilities!

B001EB5BDU|5.0|Until Dire Straits back catalogue is remastered in SACD or DVD-A format (except \\"Brothers In Arms\\" which is already in these two formats), this Japanese SHM-CD remaster will do as a subsitute.    The \\"Love Over Gold\\" had noticeable tape hiss even on the last (1999) remaster. The SHM-CD by contrast is quieter and has much sharper definition.    If you can track a copy of this SHM-CD version, good luck and be prepare to pay for it!

B002M5ZCEU|5.0|The past couple of years has been very difficult for Whitney Houston. While so much more focus has been within her personal life, from her marriage to Bobby Brown expiring after 14 years, to her issus with drug problems, to the death of her father John Houston, many people had wondered if she would ever get back on her feet again. That wonder had came more alive, with the anticipated release of I Look To You, and with many people wondering can she sing her heart out again. That anticipated grew very raidly throughout the Summer with lively listening parties in New York & London, to a surprising hype on The Wendy Williams show this past summer, where over 400 fans who had came from the listening party in New York and said they embraced her revival, better than any other record this year, and much more than the upcoming hype around Mariah Carey's Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel. But after all the heartbreak and storms she had undergone, the burning question still remains of Whitney can shine again, the answer is definitely heart and soul YES!!!<br /><br />I Look To You, Whitney Houston's first album with Clive Davis since 1998's My Love Is Your Love, and her first record in 7 years, is a brilliant and strong focus from all the heartbreak and loss she had felt from the past several years of her personal life. The songs here are deep from the heart, and especially from Whitney's voice and soul that makes the record capture more meaning than a lot of the wannabe divas Rihanna, Jordin Sparks and others have not even tried to feel like they've shown, the voice within. The brilliance of the album mirrors a lot more from Whitney, in some ways what the way is going through right now with the deaths of Michael Jackson and Senator Ted Kennedy, and people feeling who've lost their ways recently in that same darkness Whitney went through for so long. Each song feels like a breath of fresh air from start to finish, and is worth the wait. The songs shine through Whitney's voice strongly from tracks like the Alicia Keys penned Million Dollar Bill, and the intimate Worth it, to the deepness from the heart and the soul from the voice inside on the deepest of ballads from this album including title tearjerker track I Look To You, and the Diane Warren penned I Didn't Know My Own Strength. The modern R&B songs here also are full of life too including For The Lovers, a eclectic Island mix on Like I Never Left with Akon and the deep and moving Nothin' But Love.<br /><br />While I honestly do wish there could've been one of two extra songs on I Look To You by Whitney Houston, I absolutely cannot tell you how wonderful it is to hear her sing again. After all the heartbreak she had went through, Whitney has shown that she hasn't lost that shine in her voice at all. There honestly have been only very few albums that I've sincerely recommended for the past year. But honestly, I Look To You is the best one out there. What we saw with Michael Jackson's death as a tragedy, seeing and hearing Whitney Houston come back into the light with a album of this feeling is truthfully the musical miracle of 2009.

B000OY8NII|5.0|I like any show that can be quirky - especially when the networks seem insistent on calling something 'quirky' themselves - but I was resisting this show for some odd reason.  Well, odd segued into downright foolish, because I haven't been able to get enough of this extremely different and nicely original television show.  I'm not kicking myself for missing all those episodes though, because I'm too busy catching up!  And I can't see why I thought I wouldn't like it, since I like other quirky shows like [[ASIN:B000E41MS6 Doctor Who - The Complete First Series]].
B001AQTWF2|5.0|The past several years have been very difficult for Whitney Houston. With so much of the world seeing her nearly fall down, many people had deeply wondered could she get back up. She had so many ordeaals to deal with, from the death of her father John Houston in 2003, to her marriage to Bobby Brown ending, to her issues with her darkened vices and problems. Well with all of that aside from her, she is honestly back with her first work in over a decade with Clive Davis since 1998's My Love Is Your Love. While her last album, 2002's Just Whitney was good and scored Whitney her biggest-selling debut week in sales, many people still focused in more on her personal problems, and making her a lampooned joke as the crack is whack girl. Many people thought of her as a has-been, or used to be. That absolute heartbreak and shallowness was the reason Whitney had considered retiring and ending her career completely. But, with the recent death of Michael Jackson, many music lovers were re-awakened with the classic 80's MTV generation of music, and more hype than ever with this classic original era of music that has been reintroduced to a generation of fans who were more interested in Beyonce' and Kelly Clarkson. The timing was absolutely perfect for the return of Whitney back into the mainstream too. But do many people wonder if she still has it after everything she went through? The answer is absolutely in these words, we are definitely looking to her again, more than ever, and absolutely yes she still has got it.<br /><br />I Look To You, Whitney Houston's first album in 7 years, brings in a strong and soulful vibrance from her sophisticated voice that hasn't felt this alive and refreshing in years. While L.A. Reid, who had headed Arista during the time Just Whitney came out, he had a hard time trying to get Whitney out in the mainstream. For Clive, he always knew how to deliver with what makes Whitney a strong singer, and he does that here again brilliantly. The songs here are showcased well, like a deep and closely glanced mirror at what someone goes through as their bluest period, finally coming out into the light and beating the odds, the same way so many people are facing that right now because of losing parts of their life and the environment around them too with losing their homes and jobs. The songs here from Whitney are showcased beautifully heart and soul, reintroducing a more soulful simplicity into Whitney's voice that delivers from top to bottom from the deepest soul within on ballads like the Diane Warren penned I Didn't Know My Own Strength, to the beautiful and tearjerking title track I Look To You, to the the midnight soul style song Worth It that are all just simply from the voice within. The upbeat songs are also very driven as well too with great experimentations from soul and dance that match Whitney's mood vibrantly from the 70's soul vibe from Million Dollar Bill, which Alicia Keys brilliantly wrote, the eclectic Tropical Island themed mix on Like I Never Left with Akon, the the upbeat and striking modern R&amp;B mixes on Nothin' But Love and the lively For The Lovers, all the way to a dance driven twist on the classic soul song A Song For You, something Whitney had performed in concert for years, but never recorded a track as her own, ending with the R. Kelly penned Salute, which reflects on the ends of the end of her era with her 14 year marriage with Bobby and her heartbreak with John's death and his publicized smackdown that included a $100 million lawsuit back in 2001 that was later thrown out of court due to management problems, and stepping into the light again to start anew away from betrayal and darkness.<br /><br />After everything Whitney Houston went through, it is so wonderful to hear her sing again, like a shining star bringing out more light and spark than ever before. While so much more focus has been on the wannabe divas like Rihanna and American Idol winner Jordin Sparks, and too much focus on themusic industry going to the tween market with Miley Cyrus, the feeling of the songs haven't really been straight from the heart and soul within, and not anything for the universal listener. That is honestly what we've deeply been missing from the music scene for awhile. I Look To You is a fantastic album by Whitney Houston, and she delivers a much stronger record that makes you stop and deeply listen. I loved the album from start to finish, and I absolutely recommend this for anyone who still has been a hard core Whitney fan all these years, and anyone who is new to her music and the voice from the soul.<br /><br />Album Cover: A-<br /><br />Songs: A-<br /><br />Price: A<br /><br />Mastering: A<br /><br />Overall: A 1/2-g to the tween market with Miley Cyrus, the feeling of the songs haven't really been straight from the heart and soul within, and not anything for the universal listener.

0307269981|4.0|Male heroes are often larger than life, with big personalities and bigger footprints, and utterly unapologetic. Can you think of a female character who is anything like Jack Reacher or Lucas Davenport, and remains female?<br /><br />Not many authors can bring a character like Lisbeth Salander into being.  Lisbeth is the ultimate survivor, independent to a fault, and utterly ruthless when it comes to protecting herself and her friends. She's also endlessly inventive, and so full of anger that she could power all of Scandinavia on her very own.<br /><br />Take a young woman like Salander, put her in a threatening situation, and watch her go to work. In this novel -- which was more revealing, but less cohesive than the first -- many mysteries about Lisbeth's past are revealed, but each of them only underscores how very different she is and makes you more curious. I wouldn't wish Salander's personal history on anybody, but I hope that women like her exist in the world. She stands in the middle of her own powerful story and won't be overshadowed.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|A Long Time Whitney Fan is Disappointed!<br /><br />I am a huge Whitney Fan & have all her CDs & DVDs. I truly believe she is one of the most amazing vocalists of our time and is up there with the best of them like (Celine Dion, Leona Lewis, Mariah Carey, Jordin Sparks, etc).<br /><br />My Love is Your Love was a great CD & some of the best tracks were never released & no music videos were every done. However, the ballads on that CD that never saw the light of day were beyond spectacular (Until You Come Back, I Bow Out, You'll Never Stand Alone, etc). I even endured the tragedy that was, Just Whitney. That album was a sour note in her discography, but the only saving grace of a song was, You Light Up My Life. However, that song alone was not enough to save the album.<br /><br />I have been waiting years for this album and after hearing the album in its entirety, I am truly disappointed. There are only about 5 songs on the entire album that I like and the 5th one is questionable (I Didn't Know My Own Strength, Like I Never Left, For the Lovers, Salute, and I Look To You). All the writers/producers on this CD were writing songs for Whitney based on her personal experiences & traumatic events that she has had in the public eye (Bad Marriage, Loser Husband, Drugs, Etc). Yet, her vocals never captured any essence of someone who has lived through those things. After taking so much time off, you would think the end product would be a masterpiece and with only eleven tracks, it leaves little to be desired. I am glad the album is not entitled, Undefeated. Because the songs on this album make this thing more like defeated then undefeated. The majority of the songs seem to be striving for something great, but come up short.<br /><br />I am also a bit shocked that she has been in the business for more then twenty years and she has yet to master the art of creating a good CD. It seems like she is just a puppet and everyone else is telling her what to do. The One Hundred Eighty Million dollar contract that she has received from Arista is undeserved. With a contract like that she should be releasing a new album every two years. However, I digress. If you listen to the CD with an open mind not expecting much, you'll be fine. Hopefully the album will FLOP and Clive will repackage this thing as a re-release with ten extra bonus tracks.<br /><br />I felt Diane Warren wrote a great song, but David Foster didnt beat the HIGH NOTES out of her. She should have worked with BabyFace, SoulShock/Karlin, Tricky Stewart/The Dream, Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis, & Ryan Tedder. None of these writers/producers are on here. I am in complete shock that Ryan Tedder is not on here because Clive Davis uses him heavily for his other girls (Kelly Clarkson, Leona Lewis, & Jordin Sparks).<br /><br />Stand outs tracks:<br />I Didn't Know My Own Strength<br />Like I Never Left (Fun Upbeat Summer Song)<br />I Look To You (Uninspired, Dull, Boring, & questionable as a fave)<br />For The Lovers<br />Salute (Single Potential)<br /><br />Long time Whitney Fans are being WAYYYYY To generous with their reviews.

1569242739|5.0|My son is allergic to milk and eggs, so whenever we go to a party where there will be cake and ice cream, I pack him his very own cupcake.  I've found a lot of the cupcake recipes that are \\"safe\\" for him product very dense, heavy cupcakes, but these are light and moist and absolutely delicious!  The s'mores cupcake recipe in this book is one of our favorites but we've also made the cookies n cream and the basic vanilla and can't wait to try more of the recipes.  So far we've made these cupcakes for the neighborhood block party, and a family BBQ and no one knows they're \\"vegan\\" and everyone loved them.  I love the instructions at the beginning of the book that explain how the different ingredients contribute to the final \\"cupcake\\" and what to do if your cupcakes sink.  I also love the conversational style in which the book is written -- it was really fun to read!

0525478183|1.0|This book is the typical high school movie scenario where the pretty popular girl is hooked up with the rich athletic kid, and the nerd is secretly infatuated with her.  In this nerd fantasy, during the weeks of high school the troll becomes the hero.      Ignoring his impending graduation with honors and attending the university of his choice, his transforming moment is being sucked in to numerous felonious acts by the girl next door neighbor (the hottest babe at school) that he has lusted after for the last several years, (so that she would respect him???)  In one night they perform a series of felonies: Six counts of illegal entry, assault and battery, theft, several acts of vandalism (the story takes place in Florida where a $[...] dollars of damage is a felony, and they almost get shot. Oh yes, it earned him a kiss, (She saved her humping for the rich kid who drove a Porsche)  Our hero later goes on to get his friends commit breaking and entering, extortion, and almost getting snuffed in order to solve the great mystery.      I had a hard time getting past the glorification of gratuitous felony vandalism as anything but stupidity, and I'm certain that the the high school kids I know that go to court on felony charges two weeks from now, for much less egregious acts, think they were stupid and not heroic.  In this story the \\"hero\\" even tells a cop about his various crimes, but in this fantasy the cop does nothing.  Now that is real!    Spoiler alert:  In the end she is what she has said she was all along - she is the paper doll she wished she was not.  He earned her respect and he in on the in with her.  He gets another kiss, and then he turns her down.  The latter part of the book just drags when there is an hour by hour account of driving 1500 mile.  Where was the editor when we needed her?     Other than this, the story is a shill for a long dead poet.  I think the point was to get English teachers tolike the book.  That's not my gig. I think the language wassupposed to be a shocker.  Oh Wow. It used the F-words and other language which would likely get this review eliminated.  Not impressed. Avoid this book if you can.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I've read a few of the reviews here some are very mature and objective and some aren't. Yes, Ms. Houston has changed her voice but she has NOT LOST it; mark my words. She can still sing better than most of the new R&B singers out there. To expect a Whitney sounding like several years ago knowing what she has been through; is unrealistic and unfair. Come on now, let's be objective and real. The reviews should be about how good or bad the CD is not about how different her voice is. Even with her voice being different she can sing extremely well, with emotions and talent. People who are ranting about this or that; are people who are not open to changes and lack objectivity.  Please, be FAIR and focused on what matter which artistic value, creativity, and talent. Ms. Houston excels in all those and simply is giving us a humble yet amazing piece of work. So let's celebrate with her and enjoy her Music. And any negativity just keep it for yourself. This CD is about LOVE, Strength and Peace within oneself.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Wow.  This CD delivers.  Whitney's style has changed but I think for the better.  You can tell she put her all into this CD and it shows.  It's outstanding.  Each song is so catchy and you can listen to them over and over again.  Without a doubt, she will be winning grammy awards this year and this album is going to sell MILLIONS maybe more than any other album released it's that good!  This CD is awesome not only for older fans of Whitney but younger ones too- it's very universal and I think a lot of people can relate to the music on this CD lyrically so it's going to be a massive hit. 5/5 without a doubt.

It's a hell of a battle and one that many win......but, in the public eye, it's not so easy!!!  I bow my head to you, Whitney!  Years ago, I was one of the millions of fans who was scared for your life and that you might not get rid of the demons and rise up again!  You have more than risen!  You are soaring!!!!  This album is full of great uptempo tracks (Million Dollar Bill and the great slow start of the classic A Song For You that Whitney and her group then put a dance vibe too!) to the two power ballads (I Look To You and I Didn't Know My Own Strength).....the rest of the tracks are upbeat and mostly mid-tempo.....Whitney utilizes mostly her middle register but you hear her belt it out higher on parts of Million Dollar Bill, I Look To You and I Didn't Know My Own Strength....after seven years and many battles won, thank you Whitney and the best to you today and always!  Your fans are behind you and will always try to lift you up the way your music has lifted us up!!!!  A+!

1416972242|5.0|As I read this 2nd book I found myself trapped in their world. Very engaging. I know, its weird. But thanks to Cassie's descriptiveness in the book I was able visualize myself as/from each characters point of view.  I was in constant suspense with the character of Simon. Was he going to die? Is he going to live?   I found the incestuous relationship between Clary and Jace to be somewhat intriguing. This is most likely because in the back of my head I know they will not end up to be sibling, thanks to the hint of the Inquisitor.   I said it with Twilight and I'll say it about Mortal Instruments..but I don't know if there will be another book that is going to top this series.   Side Note: My husband keeps thinking I am obsessed with vampire novels ever since I read Twilight. I keep telling him that MI is NOT about vampires. But he still continues to point out vampire novels when we're at the bookstore.     Beware of my flippers book 3.
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|Whenever a movie takes historical liberties, you expect a good dose of comedic scenes.  Don't get me wrong, the dialogue is quite funny in some spots and there are plenty of black comedy moments in here.  It's just that the opening scene is pretty intense, and in the subsequent scenes between the Inglorious Basterds and the other characters it throws the tone completely off when juxtaposing the Basterds with other scenes.  Having said that though, I think Brad Pitt did a great job in this movie, and was really quite hilarious.  Overall, I found the movie enjoyable.
B0002858YS|3.0|3 1/2    Unabashed indie-pop with many great choruses to back it up made this debut a big deal. The entire album is a little too eager to please all the time in limitation, resulting in mild showboated repetition, but individually most songs energetically stand up to scrutiny.
B0021L8US0|4.0|While the overt political messages were frequent in the film, this was definitely an original sci-fi flick that had entertaining action sequences.  There's a trace of melancholy that runs through the film as the protagonist undergoes the metamorphosis.  What really brings this movie together is the friendship that the metamorphormizing bureaucrat forges with the alien Christopher Johnson and his kid.  A highly original take, this film definitely surfaces well above the Transformers/GI Joe type flicks that flood the summer movie market.

B001QTXM5Y|1.0|If you're a fan of The Watchmen graphic novel, then perhaps you'll love this movie. But walking into it optimistic but unfamilar with the story, as my family and I did, will try your patience big time.    For starters, pay attention to the R rating- it's there for a reason. This isn't Spiderman or Iron Man. There's plenty of sex and horror-movie levels of gore.     The first 30 minutes were actually quite promising, and even at the hour mark I was holding out hope that the story might redeem itself, but after that everything just came completely off the rails. But in retrospect, I guess I should have been on alert when Bob Dylan's \\"The Times They Are A-Changing\\" normally three minutes, had to be altered to play over the six minute opening montage, which starts the process of filling is in on the back-story. Unfortunately, that's only the beginning of this problem; the Watchmen simply has so much history to fill the viewer in on that the lengthy flashback sequences eventually bring any momentum the film had grinding to a halt. Over the course of 2 hours and 43 minutes, the narrative goes from slow to outright dull to seemingly endless. Eventually, you simply don't care what happens to any of the characters, or if the whole world goes up in a nuclear fireball. By the time it all ends, the credits almost seem like a blessing.    I'm a fan of both horror movies and superhero movies, so I figured this might be right up my alley, but i just can't emphasize enough how brain numbingly DULL this movie is.
1596912863|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed AUSTENLAND, and I highly recommend it if you are looking for a light, fun story. AUSTENLAND is rather short (under 200 pages) and it's a very easy read that is also very funny! I actually read it in one sitting. I thought the premise of the novel was extremely cute. Jane, a 30 something woman in New York, has had terrible luck with relationships -- partly because no man can live up to her idea of Mr. Darcy. When her great aunt wills her a vacation to an English resort that re-creates the Regency era, she gets to live out her dream and has the opportunity to meet the \\"perfect\\" gentleman. While she is on this three week vacation, she reflects on her past and ends up discovering a lot about herself. This self-awareness allows Jane to experience men and love on an entirely new level!<br /><br />I thought Jane was a terrific character. Even though (or maybe because) she was a little quirky, I couldn't help but like her. Her honestly and self-deprecating humor were so refreshing and actually made the book so funny. I loved her insight into her life (and everyone else's), and I thought her reactions to the various characters was hilarious. She was just one of those characters that you rooted for -- I really wanted her to fall in love and live happily ever after.<br /><br />One thing that I really enjoyed about this book were the brief descriptions of Jane's past boyfriends that appeared at the beginnings of some chapters. They were kind of like the icing on the cake for me. I found myself laughing (a lot) as I read them. From the little boy who was her first kiss to the boy who ended up snorting, I thought all of these stories gave some perspective into Jane and her issues with guys. I think any woman who has ever experienced the whole dating scene will appreciate these little snippets.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I'm so happy that Whitney is finally back.  I have her new cd on repeat.  What I love about this cd is that it has something for everybody and it's such a fun album, very energetic and feel-good.  Whitney sounds incredible, AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!  She's the best ever.

B001HN6EF4|5.0|Once you play with these Uno cards you'll never want to go back to the paper ones again! Shuffling these cards is so much easier than the paper ones and the cards are shuffled better because they seperate much easier! They are slippery little devils to hold on to until you get the feel of them when shuffling. Everyone that has played with these cards at my home said they wouldn't use the original cards ever again!
B000A2RRF4|5.0|To really understand the magic and genius of Michael Jackson is to watch him live.  Live in Bucharest does not disappoint with the dazzling musical numbers and light shows. Michael's energetic rendition of Beat It is a good example as he commands the stage that leaves the frenzied crowd screaming for more.   As a fierce showman, Michael captures your attention as he goes through his medley of hits with showstopping choreography.  This is a treat for anyone to enjoy and Michael Jackson shows why he is the one and only King of Pop.

B00011CZRE|3.0|Maybe I am spoiled having seen the entertaining and taut \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\". Maybe serial killer thrillers will never measure up to that one. I can't dismiss \\"Se7en\\" completely, but I did find it overrated. It's been praised often and by many. Sure, it's atmospheric and gruesome, but so is most familys' junk drawer.<br /><br />Rain looks good in movies. It enhances the mood in film noir, in romance, in horror, in suspense, and in detective tales. But this is ridiculous excess. In a constantly rainy metropolis, we learn about this madman who has been inspired by the seven deadly sins. This detective yarn becomes predictable as it progresses. By the ending you can figure out what's about to go down.<br /><br />I do wish the screenplay was better; the relationship between the two main characters could have been really well defined, even witty and clever. Instead we get the 'same-old same-old' detective partners: wise one and reckless one. It's been done a bajillion times.<br /><br />Of course the production design was fairly effective-- but you expect that in a film like this anyway (and style doesn't win me over much if the story doesn't enthrall me at all). And the score by Howard Shore was good. But overall this is the sort of thriller that I see once and then have no wish to view again. It just didn't live up to the praise, for me personally.<br /><br />Bottom line: Worth a rental if you never saw it.
B000008COG|4.0|I came to AC/ DC as a listener fairly late--to me they were little else but a down under variation of Aerosmith. Just another headbanger outfit. But I was always a Neil Young fan, and I noticed on his album \\"Mirror Ball\\" that guest backup band Pearl Jam came across a lot like an old favorite--Grand Funk Railroad. It occurred to me that Young's frequent collaboration with Crazy Horse might have brought that out of Pearl Jam. Then I heard that leader Eddie Vedder cited GFR as an early influence. I thought back on AC/ DC material I'd heard and realized that there was a lot about the band that resembled another old favorite: Mountain. So I started building a collection of their stuff. And it's not like they're one-dimensional like I'd dismissed them as being before. This album has a track \\"Meanstreak\\" that has them sounding like the rhythm section of Parliament/ Funkadelic. I had it in my MP3 player during my exercise walk this morning and found myself mentally filling in the horns. And I reflected on the fact that I'd jumped on the latest release \\"Black Ice\\" right when it came out at WalMart. From a band that used to grate on me. I guess a listener has to learn how to listen just like the artists he's listening to have to learn how to play.

B002DKGWSE|4.0|THIS ONE IS FOR ALL YOU PARENTS OUT THERE!...    Every now and then I see a film outside of my usual respected circle; but being a movie fan, I can watch with an open mind (or at least try to). As a remake this version of The Last House On The Left gives the impression of a horror at first glance, but is in fact a taunt thriller with intense scenes of violence, rape and drug use; in a broad perspective however, this movie has a twist that makes it strangely intelligent. Some of the scenes may be hard to watch for viewers with a weak propensity for gore, but for a change this film gives the violence a purpose; it speaks to our inner barbarism and dares us to ask, \\"What would I do if...?\\" Usually, I'd be the last person to recommend a film of this nature to a younger, teen viewer, but if you should happen to have a premiscuous son or daughter who thinks that there's nothing wrong with flirting with a stranger or getting into a car with a someone just because he or she is cute well, this movie could be the \\"wake up call\\" they've been missing.    Teenagers should have seen enough of these films to catch a hint, but to those elect few who wouldn't know danger from a picnic with Mickey Mouse or who (for whatever reason) are living only \\"in the now\\" as I call it, this film lays it out in an easy-to-understand reminder why you shouldn't talk to strangers (duh!). The real terror here isn't within the movie itself... oh,no; the terror comes in the fact that art often imitates life!    ...But what does mom and dad know, right?  Have fun kids!

B001PJRAUS|4.0|[[ASIN:B001PJRAUS Lost in Austen]] A few months ago, while watching TV I stumbled with this program, which proved to be really refreshing. Since I was a teenager I've been a huge fan of Pride & Prejudice and of Colin Firth acting as Mr. Darcy, so I have to admit that at first I wasn't sure if I was going to like \\"Lost in Austen\\", but I did. I loved the turns & twists, but also the way each character is developed based on their own characteristics (for example: I've always liked Bingley as a character because he is described as a very nice, loyal, gentlemanlike and amiable man but he is also weak) so it is interesting, once knowing each charcaters' qualities and flaws to see them developed in a \\"what if\\" scenario such as this. I especially enjoyed to see how the \\"real\\" Wickham turned out to be. However, I also have to say that I did not like the outcome of Charlotte Lucas's character, especially when Lizzie explained its meaning to Amanda. Aside from that it was really very entertaining and fun to watch, so I highly recommend it.

B001AQTWF2|3.0|On an early track of her latest CD, Whitney Houston poignantly sings \\"I want you to love me/Like I never left.\\"  Having listened twice through now, I can wholeheartedly claim that I still do.  Which is not to say that \\"I Look to You\\" is a great album, or even a good one. But, hold on, it's not really a bad one, either.  For the most part it plays out like a greatest hits collection in that we pretty much know what's coming next.  Early bubblegum (\\"Million Dollar Bill\\") is followed by some power ballads (like the title track), followed by some mild flirtations with electronic hip-hop (\\"For the Lovers\\" for example).  Houston is playing squarely in her comfort zone here, but she's earned it, no?  Not every album can, should or needs to reinvent the wheel.  The only true misfire is a disco (yes, you heard it here first) version of the Donny Hathaway classic \\"A Song for You.\\"  It's bizarre, to say the least, unlikely to be remembered as one of that song's best renditions.<br /><br />And how is Houston's voice?  A little heavier and thicker than it was, frankly, but still quite strong and supple.  Perhaps the single most telling indication that something's changed is that every song stays solidly in the same key from beginning to end.  A couple of times I thought, \\"Here comes the old Whitney Houston kick-ass modulation\\"...but it never happened.  OK, so now we know, we can all move on.<br /><br />Neither a triumphant return to form nor a crash-and-burn disaster, \\"I Look to You\\" is the uneventful return of an old friend.  I, for one, am just fine with that.

0312360266|4.0|When I began reading this book I found it boring and dull. Then as the book progressed I realized how much I actually liked it and how interesting it was. The authors did a wonderful job with the story and I loved the tattoo idea! The reason the book started to slow was because they had to introduce the characters properly. I am now on book 4 and IM HOOKED. This was definately a good read.
0307269981|3.0|As much as I was engrossed into the first book, the second installment of Salander series left me somewhat disappointed.  I've already predicted in the middle of the book that Zala was related to her and that of course she would be left alive.  All the evil had to be former members of GRU (of course, how else you can do a thriller w/o the Russians?:)<br /><br />Overall:  B-.  Seriously contemplating now whether or not to buy the third installment.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|If you like Whitney, you'll probably like many of the songs on this CD.  It's an airy but grounded mix of  super sharp pop soul tunes filled with Whitney's typical gospel flourish elan.  The highlights are Million Dollar Bill, Nothin But Love, Call You Tonight, A Song For You, and I Didn't Know My Own Strength.  If you prefer your soul music down and dirty, your gospel shouted to the rafters, or your pop over processed and sterile, this is probably not the album for you.  But if you're a fan of real singers singing about love and the travails of living, I believe this set will be a happy companion for you on many occasions: driving in rush hour traffic, on the treadmill at the gym, late at night went you need something soothing to help you relax, after a break-up, or finding new love.  It's all touched on in this CD and the voice taking you on the journey happens to have a bit of mileage on it so you actually believe it.  This is Whitney at her most straight forward and approachable on a polished set of good to great songs sang not only with heart, guts, soul, but also with jubilation, conviction, and passion.  That's good enough for me.

0465011012|4.0|Book Review: The Aquariums of Pyongyang: Ten years in the North Korean gulag, by Kang Chol-Hwan     I thought this book might be a hard read.  The Aquariums of Pyongyang chronicles the life of the author as a boy who, at the age of nine, was wrongfully imprisoned with his family in a North Korean concentration camp.  Not exactly most people's choice for summer reading.  I picked it up mostly because of those two American women journalists who had just been released from a North Korean prison a couple days before, and I thought it would be, at the very least, relevant to world events.  I thought, well, maybe I'll educate myself on the basics and then skim the details. I didn't. I read each page enthralled by this man's heroism and resolve during this time of horrific injustice.    I was drawn in by what I found most unexpected, and couldn't help being fascinated by the author's amazing struggle for survival.  What struck me most was that this family weren't anti-communists, weren't revolutionaries who were bent on overthrowing the government.  Instead, they were communists, originally North Korean, but drawn back from settling in Japan with the hope of an even better life in North Korea.  They chose North Korea based on the images that Kim Sung-Il projected to the world of a thriving communist lifestyle.  What they found there shocked them.  It was nothing of the sort.  A country of severe poverty and militarism, they were slowly and systematically stripped of their possessions.  Then one day the police stormed their house, and placed all the family, except the author's mother, in the Yodok prison in the wilderness and mountains for a ten-year sentence, facing brutal treatment, inhumane living conditions, and severe malnutrition.  His terrible ordeals were well written, but told in such a way that it made it not too burdensome or gruesome for the reader to bear.  Thankfully.  I breathed relief every time he triumphed over each adversity.    I kept having to set my book down for a minute and grasp the fact that this wasn't a story from the 1940's, with lessons of history learned from the Holocaust, but that it was the 1980's and 90's.  That it was real. I think of where I was during this same time. I had no idea.  And that this very thing occurs today I can't fully comprehend.  This book serves its purpose well in bringing attention to the oppression and isolation to North Koreans, and gives a voice to a nation of people whose voice has been taken away from them by a ruthless dictatorship.

B002CAWNEM|3.0|Beyonce was not right for this menial part. Her acting wasn't for this part. (Beyonce is too good for this) Now she is a good actor and I would have loved to see her as the wife but this tacky story line was not for her. Idris Elba played his part. (I love me some Idris!!) And Ali Larter played hers . BUT this movie was low grade; well the story line was anyway and worst of all it wasn't finished.   Okay in the end, what happened? Did they go to court? Did the detective find out the truth? (I mean the truth speaks for itelf but the movie should give you the answer) Did Beyonce understand what happened without you guessing? I mean in the end there are a lot of gaps.  Overall, the movie is okay but wait for it to come out on cable or borrow it!!! TRUST ME!!!  It should be televised on network tv maybe even BET.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I won't repeat a synopsis here.  In short, Dexter is a serial killer who tries to live a normal life.  How this show is executed (pun intended) is what makes it so great.  The acting is always excellent.  The stories are tight and carry the flow of the overall story forward.  But there are layers of meaning, irony, jokes, and symbolism that never seem to stop.  Dexter narrates from inside his head all through the show and over the course of the first three seasons, he grows from a hollow shell into a near human by experiencing human events as they're forced upon him.  His narrations are usually along the lines of, \\"So this is what a relationship is.  It's complicated, but it does provide some good elements.\\"  It's as if he's an alien observing a normal human life from the outside and telling us what he finds.  A lot of the observations are astute and interesting.  Many are funny.      Probably the most precise satisfaction, at least for me, comes from the irony.  This is Shakespeare level irony, like sleeping with your mother without knowing or killing yourself because you thought your lover was dead when she wasn't.  In the same few minutes, Dexter's sister tells him how he's the best brother ever and she doesn't know what she would do without him, and if she ever finds the killer (the same Dexter) she'd shoot him in the head.  His girlfriend is glad to have Dexter's protection when there are murderers about.  His executions are uncomfortable and alarming, but then he turns around and makes the kids pancakes in their favorite shapes.    This summary doesn't do the show justice.  And I'm sure this show isn't for everyone.  But it's smart, funny, interesting, meaningful, dark, frightening, happy, sad, entertaining, and compelling.
B00127RAJY|3.0|It is hard to submit a review for this video. I did follow it and enjoyed it - the workout flies by because she gives you no rest and you really break into a sweat. I was so hopeful for this workout and I stuck to it, but I had to stop. It is incredibly hard on your knees and it wasn't worth the pain and long term damage. I'd rather find a safer workout. My knees were killing me after 3 days of working out on level 1 so I took one day off and continued thinking I just needed to build up endurance - unfortunately that wasn't the case. I wish I could give this video 5 stars, but my knees won't let me.

0812971825|5.0|This is one of those novels which makes me you feel happier about the world.  It is not that the minister is such a great human being, but that he worries about being good.  His congregation are not especially good people either (excepting Carol Meadows), but like most humans, they can be kind.     The writing is terrific.  Strout makes commonplace events, and inner dialogue interesting.  She is very cognizant of sky, and light, and trees, but is not especially good in those descriptions.  Her psychological metaphors and subtleties, on the other hand, are often brilliant.  \\"Because accompanying the sense of lightness Connie felt in the minister's house these days was a seeping upward of dark things, as though the warmth of the man's friendship was like the sun on a field of snow, beneath which things deep in the soil were affected.\\"     One error: it was of course an atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima, not a hydrogen bomb as stated in the novel (p. 168, hardback).

0316154687|4.0|A thoroughly entertaining collection of essays. I don't recall reading Sedaris before, although I am familiar with the titles of his previous collections. I really don't know why he's been under my radar, and I'm not going to let him remain there any longer.<br /><br /> This collection intrigued me at first because of praise I had read for the longest piece, \\"The Smoking Section,\\" in which Sedaris describes the end of his decades-long cigarette-loving addiction. It is a really well done essay, funny and true. Since he and his partner, Hugh, go to Japan as a place to quit the `cancer stick,' it's also an essay full of garbled Japanese-to-English translations, and the fun of Sedaris' realization that he is the absolute worst student in his Japanese class. My only (selfish) wish is that he had picked up a smoke at the end and rejoined the outcasts.<br /><br /> I laughed out loud in several places, and my favorite essay is \\"Town and Country,\\" in which Sedaris is shocked at the vocabulary he hears from a well-heeled older couple on a plane, and then equally dismayed by a conversation he has with a cabbie in New York. Another little gem is \\"Old Faithful,\\" the tale of a boil that grows on Sedaris' tailbone, and the ministrations of the faithful Hugh. \\"Solutions to Saturday's Puzzle\\" is hilarious, as the author begins filling in his Times crossword puzzle with responses to the harpy he's seated next to on yet another flight. \\"Eighteen across: `Not impressed.' Eleven down: `Whore'.\\"<br /><br /> \\"That's Amore\\" is a rather sweet essay about the crabby, feisty old lady who lived in the same apartment building with David and Hugh in the early 1990s. She's a real scrapper, bigoted and yet big-hearted, and the genuine affection between Helen and the two men is palpable and never cloying. I guess I'll be working backward, but it's on to \\"Dress your Family in Corduroy and Denim\\" for me.

0307269981|5.0|Absolutely riveting follow-up to 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.'  Whereas the first book in this series had Mikael Blomkvist as the main protagonist, with Lisbeth Salander along to help and intrigue him, this one is centered on Salander and the way in which her past comes hurtling back to catch up with her.<br /><br /> When the book starts, Blomkvist and the \\"Millennium\\" magazine staff are working on exposing a sex trafficking operation with highly placed Swedish society and government targets about to be named. Salander returns to Sweden after globe-trotting for a year on the money she `earned' in the last book's operation, and tries to explore the idea of putting down roots in a new home.<br /><br /> Before the expose can be published, however, its author and his partner are murdered, and within hours, Salander is the prime suspect. Naturally, the resourceful young woman eludes capture as she embarks on her own campaign to root out the murderers and face down her connection to the ugly business at hand, deeply rooted in her hidden (up to this point) past. Blomkvist begins his own investigation, convinced when no one else is of Salander's innocence. Ever the computer genius, Salander hacks into Mikael's computer and answers his hidden message to her, and the two begin a tentative collaboration to clear her name, and in the process, to reveal who Lisbeth really is.<br /><br /> The police investigation is never dull, with a cast of good characters drawn with fine details. The action moves along at a suspenseful pace, and Salander and Blomkvist are reunited for the book's climactic scenes. Did not want this book to end, and sighed when it did, knowing I'll have to wait a full year for the next (and last) installment. I disagree with those reviewers who found this book inferior in any way to the first. I did not become bogged down or feel the action sag in the middle. Nope. Thoroughly satisfied.

B002KSPKRS|4.0|I purchased the Turtle Beach Ear Force X1 wired headset nearly 2 years ago; I love them even though they're wired and hurt my ears after several hours of gaming. I though tried upgrading to the Ear Force X3 wireless headphones about six months ago, but they were HORRIBLE. Infrared technology should only be used for a TV remote. Any time someone walked in front of me or I turned my head the wrong way they'd stop working.... they were immediately returned. When I saw the Ear Force X41 headset at a local electronics store and read \\"7.1 surround\\" and \\"RF technology\\" on the package I couldn't stop grinning... until I found the price tag.    With a great deal of hesitation I purchased the $200 Ear Force X41 headset... I took a bit of coaxing to convince my wife it was a worthwhile purchase. ;)     COMFORT: The x41 is slightly more comfortable than the old EarForce x1. The earpiece is slightly larger, more circular than the old X1 - X3's by Turtle Beach, and they're also padded with thicker foam and cloth; rather than the old thin foam and leather-like material. They still press a bit tight against the ears, like the old X1/X3's, which cause a bit of discomfort after a few hours of game play. (the top \\"headband\\" is well padded, and the leather like material is far superior to the old headsets.) The boom mic placement is a bit further away than I'd like too. Overall I'd have to say they're SLIGHTLY more comfortable than my old Ear Force X1 headset.    BUILD QUALITY: The x41 is fairly impressive as far as build quality goes. The plastic used is much thicker and feels more sturdy than previous Ear Force models. The boom mic is removable, the arm of the boom mic is made of a flexible metal, and the mic is much nicer than my x1's. The Volume, Bass Boost, and power buttons are extremely easy to access and won't require you to remove the headset to locate them.     The transmitter base is very nice. It's sturdy, not bad to look at, and doubles as a stand for the headphones when they're not in use. The transmitter accepts standard left/right (white/left) audio input, as well as digital optical input... it even has a digital optical out which is necessary if you use the optical output on the Xbox 360's HDAV pack.     SOUND QUALITY: When I first turned the X41's on there was a noticeable hiss. I turned the volume down all the way and it was still there. It wasn't BAD, but I did notice it. When audio is being played through the X41's it's impossible to hear the hiss, which made me quickly forget there was even a hiss to begin with. Even during quiet sections of certain games I didn't notice it, but since I do hear it when I first turn them on before playing a game, I thought it would be necessary to write about it.    It's also notable that when the boom mic is connected, you can hear ambient noise as well as your own voice being amplified by the mic. If you hate hearing your own voice through the headset, or are playing a single player game, I strongly recommend removing the boom mic from the X41's.    The first game I played was a Samurai/anime title on my Xbox 360 with the X41. The dialogue sounded a bit hollow and it echoed a bit... it didn't sound horrible, just a bit odd. I popped in an old movie that has one of my favorite THX intros for my second test. I was surprisingly impressed. I could rewind the intro, close my eyes, and tell exactly where the little robot repair guy was while he was flying around the THX logo performing his repairs... I could even here subtle clacks, clanks and tings during the intro that I couldn't hear before when using the Ear Force X1's.     While playing an extremely popular first person shooter I was floored by the surround reproduction. I could hear bullets whizzing by my head, could tell which direction the shots came from, and hear the footsteps of my enemies slowly creeping up behind me... I can honestly say that I now have a slight advantage over any one of my friends who use standard stereo headphonesto play during our late night online gaming sessions... I'm not sure the advantage was worth the price tag on the X41's, but it's pretty darn close.    CONCLUSION: The X41 is wireless. This headset isn't infrared (IR) like its predecessor, these bad boys are 2.4 GHZ wireless digital RF! What this means is that you don't have to sit directly in the line of sight of the transmitter! (It's about time!!!) I was able to wander out on my back porch and to the kitchen to grab an adult beverage without any interruption in voice chat or game audio.    One feature I was pleasantly surprised by is the ability to connect any pair of stereo headphones, or in my case my old pair of Ear Force X1's, to the transmitter/Dolby decoder and share the 7.1 experience with a friend. (Yes, standard headphones will sound like full surround speakers when connected!)    They're expensive, they're not as comfortable as I would have liked for my 3-4 hour gaming sessions, and the playback of sounds from the mic through the headset is a bit annoying.... but... the improvements over previous Ear Force headphones, 7.1 surround, and 15 hour battery life far outweigh these small annoyances.

1400043662|4.0|The adjective inevitably attached to Haruki Murakami is \\"metaphysical.\\" There certainly is some Hegel in Kafka on the Shore, delivered in the form of a lecture by a woman of the night after a \\"totally artistic act of [pleasuring a man],\\" and immediately after a quote from Henri Bergson. I'm told enrollment in philosophy Ph.D. programs shot through the roof, so to speak, after Kafka came out.<br /><br />It could be that I'm just not bright enough, but I didn't really grasp the metaphysics in Kafka on the Shore. I'm similarly mystified by the supposed depth of Paul Auster's writings; I love The New York Trilogy and Oracle Night but the philosophy in each seemed to me an excuse for laziness. We're moving along in three meta-mystery novels, when it turns out that the lens turns in on the detective. Or we're hiding in a dark basement, when the lens turns in on the protagonist. It's an excuse not to end a story while pretending that you have.<br /><br />Fortunately, I'm pretty sure that Murakami's supposed metaphysical genius says more about the laziness of book reviewers than it does about Murakami. Most of what makes Kafka on the Shore, and After Dark, and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle enjoyable, is Murakami's facility as a storyteller. Wind-Up Bird is a constant tease, and so is Kafka on the Shore. We start Kafka with two my God, what the hell is happening stories which will play out, in parallel and intersecting ways, throughout the rest of the book. On the one side, we have a classroom full of Japanese children hiking off into the hills in 1944, as the country is being bombed to within an inch of its life. They reach a clearing and stop to take a break, and every one of them falls unconscious. Their teacher stands there, stunned, before racing back to her village to get help. All but one of those students regains consciousness within a couple hours. One of them falls into a coma and wakes up with an empty brain and with the ability to talk to cats. So ... that happened.<br /><br />In the present-day part of Kafka we meet the novel's namesake. He's running away from home for reasons unknown. We know it has something to do with his cruel, distant father, but that's about it. Kafka may be crazy; he certainly carries a disembodied voice, whom he calls \\"the boy named Crow,\\" that talks to him sometimes. \\"Kafka,\\" by the way, isn't his real name. He's chosen it as part of the new identity with which he sets out on the road.<br /><br />(Soon enough Kafka receives manual stimulation that seemingly comes from nowhere, thus furthering my hypothesis that Philip Roth made unexplained sexual favors, unaccompanied by reciprocation, respectable within \\"literary\\" novels. As the novel progresses, the manual stimulation makes a bit more sense, but I can't escape the suspicion that a lot of highbrow male authors think, \\"Unwarranted sexual climax? Don't mind if I do!\\")<br /><br />On one path, then, we have the brainless cat-talker (who, by the way, refers to himself exclusively in the third person: \\"Nakata needs to take a dump\\" and so forth). On the other we have a really interesting little kid, setting out into the world without much of a plan. He ends up in one of those ornate libraries specializing in obscure forms of literature; it's the only place where he can expect to be left alone as he formulates a plan for his next steps. He meets its librarian, Oshima, and its head, Miss Saeki. Everyone's got some terrible secret. Sometimes the secrets are actually nauseating. The story is always gripping.<br /><br />We flip back and forth between the two threads. They come closer together, and eventually the flipping happens every few pages. Murakami knows how to nail his dramatic pacing. You won't put this book down once you pick it up.<br /><br />By the end, a lot remains unanswered. I think that's almost a definition of a \\"Murakami novel\\", but somehow it's less frustrating here than in Wind-Up Bird Chronicle. The storytelling more than makes up for any leftover plot holes. I'm unwilling to call Kafka \\"metaphysical,\\" though. That word shouldn't just be a synonym for \\"vague.\\"sical,\\" though. That word shouldn't just be a synonym for \\"vague.\\"

On Blu-ray the presentation gets an A, yes there is grain but as stated thats nothing to do with the Blu-ray Bg was made that way.  Sounds is wonderfully dynamic and there are enough extras to keep you going for ages.    The box is surprisingly very sturdy and stands out in the crowd but because of size i have to store it in a different place on its own, however the disc packaging is poor with cardboard sleevesand no protection.  The discs are a little difficult to slide out.  I have bought loads of plastic clam shell cases that are small/thin enough to fit in the existing packaging.    All in all I love this box set.

1416550542|5.0|This book gracefully unfolded before me, opening petal after petal of detail creating a glorious story.  I was afraid of this one, since the book is not written from beginning to end, yet skips about and might be distracting or be hard to follow, but it truly wasn't.  It was so well done, I was sad to see it end.  I read it so fast, because I just had to know what happened next, that I would like to go back and read more slowly someday, to savor each wonderfully written page.  Do not hesitate to try this book, especially if you favor well written novels that are NOT considered \\"bodice-rippers.\\"  This is anything but that, and I would give it more stars if I could.

0307269981|1.0|The first book was for the most part plot-driven. The 40-year old murder mystery took a while to unfold, but was interesting when it did. So was Lisbeth, although she wasn't the main focus. The story has now turned character-driven with Lisbeth as the protagonist. But instead of having much of a plot of any character revelations about her early on, we read about her buying a new apartment, grocery shopping, and what furniture she picked out at IKEA in *great* detail. Seriously, you could go down to the store and decorate the same way if you wanted, that's the level of description he gave. I was bored out of my mind. This goes on for a staggering 172 pages.<br /><br />Mystery thriller? Surely you jest! This book wasn't a mystery whatsoever in my honest opinion. No spoilers to ruin it though. More thrilling than the first book, however.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson just doesn't write very interesting characters. A few major players from the first book reappear here with no apparent purpose. They do not drive the plot forward in any way or aid in developing other characters. Two or three cops at most were necessary on the case, but instead there are a bunch. All the men in these stories can be lumped into two groups: men who hate women and the good guys who like Lisbeth. Bublinsky is the only impartial one of the lot. A shame he and the rest of the cops were just bumbling fools the whole time. And Zala, the big bad who's alluded to throughout the book. Right. Maybe instead of all the pointless cop scenes Larsson could've actually developed the antagonist this time.<br /><br />And the single interesting character he does have, Lisbeth, is portrayed as \\"The Terminator.\\" Really. The Guardian agrees. She's so smart and such an awesome fighter. She's morphed into a superhero now. Suspension of disbelief? Gone.<br /><br />The turning point didn't happen until page 172, which was about 100 pages too late to hold the interest of any reader who's not a masochist. The quick pace and interest it generates rapidly disappears until 375. Where was the freaking editor? It was more bloated than a rotting whale.<br /><br />I can only recommend it over Twilight thanks to the gratuitous lesbian sex early on and the fact that Lisbeth is 100x better than Bella.

0307269752|2.0|I wanted to like this book. It has a cool title (not so much in Swedish, coincidentally). For the most part it has been well-received. The back says things like \\"Don't even think about putting it down\\" and \\"Brilliantly written and totally gripping.\\" Were we reading the same book? I mean, really? Because if not for the mildly engaging middle third of the book, it was a total snoozefest. There was lots of sex! But I digress...<br /><br />Something that bothered me a lot, and it's more style points than anything else, is that it really needed an American translation, not an \\"English\\" one. I know where Stockholm is, but I couldn't say where any of the other cities mentioned are at so I felt detached from the setting. I didn't like reading Herr instead of Mister because I'm out-of-touch and uncultured tyvm. There were half-page scenes that added nothing to the story, which made me wonder why they were even stuck in. Of course, I now realize they could've been hooks for future stories in what was supposed to be a 10-book series.<br /><br />The protagonist, Mikael Blomkvist, is about as boring as they come and as far as I can tell cut from the same mold as the author himself. Every woman wants to sex him up the moment they see him, and I had a hard time trying to understand why. Of course, the ensuing sex is so predictable it's almost farcical. I actually laughed out loud at one point. But that boring character goes hand-in-hand with his plotline, the who-done-it murder mystery that didn't get interesting until he started looking for clues. Prior to that, the reader is inundated with a family history that is painful to read.<br /><br />Lisbeth (girl with the dragon tattoo) should've been the protagonist. She was the only character I gave half a damn about. It bothered me that she was a little too awesome though. I think a person could figured the same things out she did by being smart without needing a photographic memory...that she could be an ok hacker with hacker friends without being one of the best hackers in Sweden. Overpowered characters make me throw the BS flag. Sorry Lisbeth.<br /><br />Antagonists? They're so easily dispatched by Lisbeth that the plot was trivialized.<br /><br />I thought the whole mystery was decent with a bit of random shock value thrown in to make the story worthwhile reading. But all of that ends with 50 pages left to go, taking the poor reader back to the dull financial journalist drama that the book began with. I'm not sure how anyone could make that sort of stuff interesting. Seems fresh and original enough, but damn...needs more SOMETHING. Like action? Please?<br /><br />Also too much irrelevant life narration: \\"He put on a pot of coffee and made himself two sandwiches. He had not eaten a proper meal all day, but he was strangely uninterested in food. He offered the cat a piece of sausage and some liverwurst. After drinking the coffee, he took the cigarettes out of his jacket pocket and opened the pack.\\" Mmm, k. Bored now. Not so bad if it's occasional but it's not.<br /><br />Larsson also had a lot of passages that tell instead of show. Case in point: \\"Blomkvist leaned back and pretended to be insulted, but he frowned when Berger made some cryptic remarks that might allude to his failings as a journalist but might also have applied to sexual prowess. Vanger tilted his head back and roared with laughter.\\" Could he not think of a suitable joke to share with the reader? Because I really wanted to read it! He also needed to do a little POV work because he mixed it up in a few places -- me being picky, I know, but an editor should've caught that.<br /><br />The last scene was really good. And there were a few with Lisbeth that stood out too, mainly her introduction and a few of the action scenes. But I felt like the main characters were too detached from the main plot and at any time they could just say \\"screw it, I'm done.\\" Book over.<br /><br />Two stars. Boring but easy to read. Better than Twilight.

It's author is Robert Louis Stevenson (1850-94) the TB suffering Scotsman who died in the South Seas in a futile quest for health. Stevenson is also known for such classics as \\"Treasure Island\\"; \\"A Child's Garden of Verses\\"; \\"Kidnapped\\" and \\"The Master of Ballantrae\\". He wrote several excellent short stories. Two of them are included in this classy Penguin edition \\"Olalla\\" a tale of doomed loved in Spain and \\"The Body Snatchers\\" concerning criminals who stole bodies from the grave selling them to medical schools during the nineteenth century.<br />  Dr. Henry Jekyll is a middled aged London doctor. His story is told by two first person narrators: a lawyer and a doctor who are long time friends of Jekyll. The reader is also privy to the confessional diary penned by Jekyll prior to his horrible end.<br />  Dr Jekyll experiments with chemicals transforming himself into the ape-like Edward Hyde (get it-he hides!). Hyde commits an atrocious murder. It is because of this and the torment in his soul that Jekyll commits suicide which , of course, also does away with Hyde.( the two are really one tormented man.).<br />  This short novella appeared at the same time Jack the Ripper was atrociously murdering prostitutes in London. An affinity was made between Hyde and the Ripper by the British reading public.<br />The story became a best seller for Stevenson and the expression \\"A Jekyll and Hyde personality\\" has become a common metaphor in life for someone with a personality disorder. It was also written during the time period in fin de siecle Vienna when Freud was championing his ideas concerning the ego, superego and id fighting for supremacy in the human personality.<br />  The Penguin edition includes an excerpt of Stevenson's article concerning the importance of dreams in the life of the creative artist.

B002M5ZCEU|5.0|This CD is great.  Sounds just like the old Whitney.  It's the kind of music that makes you feel good, wanna sing along, get up and dance.  Way to go Whitney!!!
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Whitney Houston returns to the music scene with \\"I Look To You\\". The question on everyone's mind is does she still got it? When I listened to the title track \\"I Look To You\\" and the new single `Million Dollar Bill', I have to say that I wasn't expecting a lot. These tracks seemed very safe, timid, reserved; no real `diva' theatrics, the voice is there but it's not as we remember it. My mother heard `Million Dollar Bill', having fond memories of Houston and her past hits, but commented that she sounds like she's changed and the voice she remembered wasn't truly there and present. In all honesty, while Houston's voice is good, there wasn't a vocal performance on this release that gave me chills like some of her past songs `I Believe In You and Me' or the career high `I Will Always Love You.' But, saying that, I felt by the final track, there was a lot to like and more than half the tracks are worth listening to more than once.<br /><br />The Bad: With Houston's tabloid life over the past decade, there's a big `elephant in the room' that makes you wonder how she's address her issues, if at all. \\"I Look To You' and  `I Didn't Know My Own Strength' seem to be the expected `safe' ballads. These don't really measure up to her past material at all. They are somewhat inspirational while lacking the vocal punch Whitney Houston is (or was) known for. These tracks were boring. `Million Dollar Bill', the album's opener, isn't produced greatly and sounds low quality and almost as if it's still in the demo stages. If anything, these tracks, and others, proved that Houston has somewhat lost her vocal edge and attempts to overcompensate with lyrics and songs that try too hard to either repair her image or make her sound contemporary.<br /><br />The Good: The best songs on this release are the upbeat songs. `Nothing But Love' addresses the tabloid life Houston's been known for lately, and to me, should have been the first single. It's very upbeat, sassy and doused in attitude and flavor, reminding me of some of her late 1990s material. `Like I Never Left', another song that (to me) addressed the absence of Whitney Houston the artist, was a song that while it doesn't show off her vocal techniques, it lyrically is appealing and sounds very modern and effortless. `I Got You' is up-tempo but a slow groove,  setting a very romantic tone that really suited Houston's voice. It also is one of the most catchiest on the album, sticking in my head more so than the (thus far) released singles. Houston's cover of `A Song For You' is far from a standard cover; while is starts off familiar and slow, making you groan at how she's attempting to address the `elephant in the room', it hits an up-tempo point that transforms it from a slow ballad to a fast-paced 1990s dance floor club hit. These tracks, as well as a few others, saved the album. It was a reminder of Houston's resilience, attitude, confidence that the slower songs lacked.<br /><br />In all, a good release with only about two or three songs that I'd have left off. I would not call this a `comeback' record; it felt more like a transition from her last solo effort to becoming a contemporary, modern musician in the 2000s. Yes, her voice has changed but the upbeat songs reminded me that the spirit and attitude that made her a star is obviously still there and very present.

B001AQTWF2|2.0|After taking such a long break from music I expected a bit more of an effort from this singer.  Considering where Whitney has been musically, this album doesn't deliver anything that's not been heard before. Lyrics like \\"through your hands up\\" and \\"now I stand tall\\" to  tacky gospel like songs makes it very easy to dismiss this album. There will always be hardcore fans that will love this album but if you're looking for good music look somewhere else. By the way, the title song has a good message but the singing is bad enough to make you feel embarrassed and sad for Whitney. I Look to You is an ambitious effort from Whitney but it really falls flat (no pun intended). The complaining over mistakes made in the past and bad decisions are boring and predictable. The way I see it when I buy music is the need for fun and to forget and not listing to someone with many more opportunities complain about how bad everything's been.     For those who think Whiney (Whitney) will win a Grammy, please look at how fast she's moved from the number 1 spot. In a year no one will remember this horrible CD. It's interesting to see how much of an impact the press can have on anything. It's as if they wanted success for this CD so they could have a juicy story to make more money from.

031606792X|4.0|Another book I couldn't put down until I had finished. Edward and Bella are still struggling to stay together and Volturi Coven are threatening to end their lives. I found myself screaming less at Bella to do right by Edward in this book but Jacob is still around.    Bella finally realizes some of her potential in this book, which is good because I was tired of her beating herself up about her average looks and average intelligence. There are some surprises with the new bundle of joy, Jacob, and the wolves, but since more of the characters do the right thing in this book, I'm happy.     The author could have easily made this book into two books instead (the same with her other books). For example, I was left wondering what was in South America, because  the author's description of the vampires from South America sounded so interesting. It was a satisfying ending to a good series though. Now I can get back to reality.

1932100660|3.0|Book Review  Campbell, T. Colin and Thomas M. Campbell. The China Study. Benbella Books. 2006.  Cordell E. Logan    This book stems from the early death of Colin Campbell's father in Virginia who died of a massive heart attack at age 70 after having his first heart attack at age 62 on their farm. Campbell decided to study why people, especially in America, were so unhealthy. This led to studies in the Philippines and eventually into China.    The book is well supported by statistical data (not saying it is always interpreted accurately).  Discussed is the so-called high correlation between high cholesterol and heart attacks. Even mentioned is the famous Framingham study which, according to him, \\"clearly\\" relates high cholesterol to heart attacks. Higher amounts of meat was clearly related to more health problems including cancer. Aflatoxins (as from peanuts) was discussed in relationship to cancer in the Philippines - a good study.    He did mention the importance of vitamin D.  He recognized the political aspects of medicine, the biased funding, etc.    Comments:  Though the book was published in 2006, it looks more like it came out of the early 1970s or thereabouts.    Not one word was mentioned about quality fats, omega-3s and related fats, all of which have been well researched. Now we know that grass-fed beef (and other livestock) is higher in omega-3s. In all likelihood the data he presented are based upon poor quality fats. Indeed the quality of the protein is also likely based upon poorer quality. He fails to mention the detrimental effects of soy protein (soy in general).    Newer interpretation of the Framingham study has indicated that cholesterol was not closely related to the incidence of heart attacks, plus lifestyle indices such as smoking was not originally considered. Other studies also show this, and indeed cholesterol in the 150 range seems more harmful than that of around 200.    He obviously does not understand the difference between synthetic vitamins and natural vitamins.    He cuts down the late Dr. Atkins, and boosts up Dr. Ornish. The former is of protein/fat fame, while the latter is of carbohydrate (and low protein/fat) fame. Dr. Ornish wrote approving comments in Campbell's book. So who is right? The both are when considering Metabolic Type testing (which I do).    In summary, the book is a massive and commendable study into health, but remains outdated in current interpretation, thus it only serves as a stepping stone rightfully fitted into the 1970s era.
0765350386|5.0|I thought I'd read some pretty good books recently, but after reading this one, I realized that in comparison, The Final Empire was perfect. I had the fortune of stumbling upon this book after the trilogy was completed, and I can say each book blew me away. Some series make you want to continue reading because the story ends abruptly and you feel the need to see how things work out. The Mistborn books however, each have an immensely satisfying ending, and you find yourself picking up the next book simply because the last one was so good.    Sanderson writes on his webpage that he aims to deviate from the traditional fantasy storylines, and I must say he did a wonderful job on that part. I realized that the old hero-quests-to-defeat-dark-overlord thing was getting old, so the pure originality of this book delighted me to no end. It had a nice pace, plenty of foreshadowing, and a nice twist for that 'Ohhh' moment.    I am thoroughly impressed.
B002HHPVHQ|5.0|First of all, the book is very well written.  It uses first-person narration, as if Lehman-trader Larry McDonald himself were both narrator and writer, but the endnote makes it clear that the high-quality prose technique is that of professional writer Patrick Robinson.  He is very good at his craft.  Quite interested in the financial crisis, I have read several books on the subject, and this is the most lucid and clever when it comes to explaining the underlying financial moves such as securitization in its many guises and swaps (\\"the weeds,\\" according to Buffet, \\"priced as flowers\\").  The descriptions of these financial instruments are spread throughout the book and gracefully introduced into the narration when relevant, so that the reader is learning without, more or less, being lectured.    But the really remarkable thing about this take on the crash of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing seizing of credit markets worldwide is its portrayal of Richard Fuld, the Lehman CEO as cause.  Sure everybody was doing it--bundling the sub-prime and Alt A residential mortgages into collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).  What, however, appears to have been special about Lehman's involvement, as with Bear Sterns'  (as described in \\"House of Cards\\") is the turf-protecting behavior of both firms' heads that made the derivatives fatal to their firms.  What Fuld and Cayne (of Bear) did was to function long as leaders by, so to speak, \\"killing off\\" the competition within their firms.  In other words, what makes \\"Colossal Failure\\" so compelling a read is what it has in common with \\"House of Cards\\"--the fable of leaders whose ruthlessness and aggression and cunning gets them to the top, and keeps them there.  But what it takes to make and keep Richard Fuld top-dog at Lehman is also what it takes ultimately to destroy the firm.  Fuld is portrayed as surrounding himself with yes-men whom he did not fear trying to knock him off his throne, and he and his yes-men elbowed out or eliminatedfrom the firm the sceptic talent needed for it to head off and to survive the crisis.  And Fuld in \\"Colossal Failure,\\" like Cayne in \\"Cards,\\" doesn't really seem to understand astutely the newly pioneered financial engineering moves of the CDOs and the swaps.  Both men operated in the end out of a financial concept base that seems to have been some 20 years out of date.  What they were really good at was male-to-male combat for individual supremacy like antler-clashing elk.  And both men were preceded by firm-leaders (Gluckman at Lehman and Ace Greenberg at Bear), who employed similar supremacy maximizing tactics that tutored their favored proteges and eventual successors.  There is a kind of eerie similarity to the two stories of Bear's and Lehman's demise.    There is a postmodern position that belittles the role of the individual in terms of cause--emphasizing instead the collective of intersecting minds and events as motive force.  But the amazing thing about this book for me is how much Dick Fuld appears to be responsible for the demise of Lehman. And because of the uncanny similarity with the situation of Cayne at Bear, I am left wondering whether indeed leadership is really a great deal more relevant to outcomes for organizations than the postmodernists have led me to think.  It seems, however, that what it takes for a man to get to the top at these premier arenas (the investment banks) for alpha-dog dominance is also what tends to make him prolong his tenure beyond it useful time for the common good (even including himself).
6305428050|5.0|This movie was huge when I was a child in the 80s.  It became a staple in my house then (yes, on BetaMax in those days) and is still a staple now in the 21st century!  Funny and entertaining plot and actors without tons of horrible language or situations.  I think the only possiblity for negative feedback would be the reference to Playboy magazine in part of it.  No swearing or nudity.. very wholesome family movie!  I still watch it (despite the fact that I have it memorized now) and still enjoy it immensely!  Definately buy this one! :) A++++!
B001FB55H6|5.0|This was money well spent, It's just been my boyfriends 18th and he loves Watchmen. Hes been naggin me 4 the film in Blu-ray for his birthday for ages, so I went one step better and bought the Director's Cut. He loves it and said it's the best present he got. Seriously, if your a Watchmen fan this product is a must have, with the extra parts added within the film, the special features and the added disc containing a digital copy you can't go wrong. Deffinatly a product to recomend.
B000NU2CY4|1.0|watched my friends copy this morning since he simply had to own it... well... for Paramount/Dreamworks to think this is worthy of their new 'Sapphire' line is just pathetic - quite frankly it's all out hideous.  When watched in extended mode the new footage was obviousily sourced/transfered from a better print, the theatrical scenes look just plain bad - there's digital artifacts everywhere, halo-ing, edge enhancement.  I can't believe a product of this sort and specifically for this film, where given such a shoddy transfer - this is COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE.  Rent it, if you must, but don't buy it.  A new hidef transfer of the theatrical cut should have been mandatory. To add insult to injury, the DTS-ES Discrete 6.1 soundmix, available on the 'extended edition' DVD is not present on the bluray edition - wow... whoever commissioned and oversaw this blu-ray edition should get nailed to a tree. If I were Ridley Scott I'd be p-o'd.  'Kingdom of Heaven' on blu is demo worthy, 'Gladiator' on the other hand is a major letdown
B001AQTWF2|5.0|I Look to You is a gorgeous song.  Million Dollar Bill is retro-fantastic!  I do not love every song on the CD, but I love the overall CD very much.  Glad she is back!!
B002AT4K9G|1.0|Garbage. This is just garbage. You know Hollywood has given up when they name a title the same as the original and just drop the 'The'. The first one was a piece of crap and this one is its equal if not worse. Dumb dumb dumb. Put a nail in the coffin of this dead stupid corpse PLEASE.
0307346617|5.0|I have read several of the reviews that some of my fellow Z fanatics have posted, and I will not be redundant with the political and social parrallels that Brooks creates in this novel.  What I will say is true the great Romero and great great read.
0345495004|4.0|Excellent novel. Gripping, powerful, complex story based on the true life relationship between Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Cheney. Our book club gave it a big thumbs up!
0316166685|2.0|The fault with this book, and I feel kind of insensitive referring to it that way, is in the story. It was too vapid for me. Too unsettling in how dark and yet casual this murder, death and loss was. Several reviewers have mentioned humor; I found none. Maybe I wanted revenge too much. I wanted her character to pull some Hollywood stunt that would make her death make sense, but that wasn't the author's intent and, I never could figure any other reason for the story to be. It wasn't strong enough in its focus on loss or change and it did end up utilizing mysticism here and there, so why did the author not give it a purpose? It felt like a loosely wound ball of string with ends sticking out all over the place. I was anxious for it to be over and just felt sad, as if her life (and death) had not only been meaningless, but she had left no lasting effect on anyone elses life either. Just grief, guilt and confusion.
B0029LHW4A|5.0|get born had a lot of really good up tempo songs, shine on had a lot of really good slower songs, and shaka rock has the perfect amount of both, and they all blend seamlessly together. black hearts and seventeen are my favorite off the cd because they're fun and fast, exactly the reason i fell in love with jet 6 years ago. shaka rock sounds like jet said screw trying to play for everyone else, recorded for themselves and came out with something perfect. i highly recommend it.

0307454541|5.0|The first in a 3 book series.  Very well done, interesting and difficult to unravel.  Lizbeth (the girl with the dragon tatoo)has some kind of mental disability (autism or Asberger's) which makes it difficult for her to relate to others but gives her a unique ability to discover patterns which others cannot see.
B000002H70|5.0|one of there best albums, the live concert dvd \\"trilogy\\" filmed in berlin is also really good.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I rented this at Redbox because, well, there wasn't anything else. I was expecting kind of a superbad/nick and nora type of movie that I have marginally enjoyed in the past. Wow was I delightfully surprised. This movie is not about slapstick/teenage sexual humor. It's basically a summer love story, but one that is much more realistic and truthful than 95% of the summer love stories out there. This is definitely Kristen Stewart's best role as it has 10 times the depth than any of her other roles I've seen and hopefully this will put Eisenberg on the map. Great movie for anyone 16+.
B002M5ZCEU|3.0|I was slightly disappointed in this CD. I guess I was expecting something as great as her \\"My love is your love \\"CD. This isn't it. I am sure there will be some great remixes to make up for an otherwise \\"Ho-Hum / Yawn\\" CD. Sorry, Whitney I'll sit this one out!
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|In order to enjoy this movie, you should be a fan or at least like ABBA's songs because the whole Mamma Mia's idea is just an excuse for letting the grateful viewers/listeners experience their favorite songs in a relaxing and feeling good setting on a colorful sunny idyllic Greek isle surrounded by the bluest sea you can imagine. I consider myself a loyal ABBA's fan. I still remember how I heard their songs for the first time almost thirty years ago, how happy I was to be able to own their albums on LPs, how much I enjoyed ABBA: The Movie (1977) which came to Moscow in the beginning of the 1980s and was basically the record of their concerts in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Adelaide. I also saw the famous musical Mamma Mia on which the last year movie is based on and I liked it a lot. It would not hurt if you can take with humor outrageous psychedelic outfits of the 1970s and the tight boots with the platforms so huge that it makes your feet hurt just to look at them. If that sounds like your idea of fun, fun you'll have. I sure did, at least for the first hour or to be precise until the very moment, Pierce Brosnan had ruined my favorite ABBA's song S.O.S by attempting to sing it. I guess it is sometimes easier to save the world from all sorts of evil than just to sing a song. While that torture lasted, I kept repeating instead of S.O.S, S.O.E which means Save Our Ears. I later found out that when asked during an interview why he took the role, Brosnan replied that when he heard from his agent, \\"Mamma Mia, Meryl Streep\\", he took it without asking whom he'd play. Well, acting next to Streep is a great reason, and I believe Brosnan had a lot of fun sharing the screen with her. I also believe that there is nothing impossible for Meryl. She can play anything and anybody. Just to think what she has done in all the movies she has graced with her presence. She did very convincing accents, she learned how to play a violin, she dances, she has been a villain and a saint, and everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie. While watching Mamma Mia, I got the crazy idea. What if Meryl played all six older characters, Donna, her two girlfriends and three men from her past? I know it sounds weird but if Eddie Murphy could do it, I am sure Meryl Streep could act and sing for six characters and she would be simply fabulous. Between Streep and young talented Amanda Seyfried, two of them made a nice singing/acting team. But even with Meryl playing and singing only one part, the film is still entertaining and fun mostly due to the fact that everyone involved had a good time on the charming little island, the serious actors were not afraid to make fools out of themselves for all of us to enjoy, and in the end everyone was happy and got what they wanted even if it was not exactly what they wanted in the beginning of the movie.everybody in between and she's been always the reason to watch any movie.

B001IBIQU6|2.0|Only 2 stars because this is my favorite band.  Unfortunately this CD has not grown on me and is painful to listen to.  I am so sad because I love them.
B00006JKON|5.0|In my experience, this is one of the darkest Tull album's I've ever heard. Not dark in the sense that it has depressing minor chords with quiet, brooding vocals, but rather that it is more of a black comedy.     This album is basically a mocking of the world, so lost in all of its incredibly complicated ways, and for the most part, oblivious to all of it. It gives me a funny feeling when I listen to it--a bit uneasy, which is understandable. It is an album about the uneasiness of the current situation of society.     This album is far beyond anything that any other band was making in the 70s. It posed as a pop-rock album but instead was a heavy and intense criticism of so many complicated and ugly things in society through the format of pop-rock. Very, very, very unique album. I have heard nothing like it before or since.    Certainly and album to buy, study, enjoy, and remember.

B002M5ZCEU|5.0|What a great comeback album for Whitney. It is like she never left. Great dance sings, ballads that are sweet and openly vulnerable. Good for you!!!!!  Welcome back and ever so glad you are!!! Much more success for the future.   And thank you for showing us that once the Queen always the Queen, no matter what has passed in the meantime and how long it has been. You reign!   Thank you for sharing your wonderful voice and exceptional talent with us again. If you liked her before you will love this one; if you are new to her you have been missing out on a true star and superb talent, don't miss this CD!And make sure you check out her previous stuff too!
B001AQTWF2|5.0|First off, let me start by saying that we all remember Whitney Houston for such classics as \\"I Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\\" and her rendition of \\"I Will Always Love You\\"...just to name a couple.  Well, 24 years later in the music industry, she still has what it takes to be a true diva.    She's been through a lot, and this album shows that.  Granted, she may not hit the upper registers vocally like she has in the past, but she still delivers the emotion with full force.  I have to say, hands down, the two tracks that stand out the most to me are \\"I Look To You\\" and \\"A Song For You.\\"  Production-wise, her & Clive Davis really knew what they were doing, enlisting A+ producers and songwriters for this project.  She really tackles different styles of music and is not afraid to embrace them...and pulls it off quite beautifully.  This is definitely an album worthy of purchasing!     \\"I Look To You\\" definitely marks a triumphant return for Whitney Houston after a long absence...welcome back - your public has missed you!
0142000663|5.0|I've only read two of Steinbeck's novels but so far I have loved his work.  His writing feels very down to earth and matter of fact about large issues affecting large numbers of people.  He has a very realistic feeling style and while the events of this novel have long passed it touches on larger issues that still exist today.  Sad but wonderful read.
B0000047CX|5.0|This album has all the famous songs that embody 1960's bossa nova. The recordings have good sound quality and it is a pleasure to listen to.

B001KL3GY0|5.0|Franz Ferdinand continues to have solid songs and a unique sound.  This album rocks hard! \\"No You Girls\\" is a definite hit -- a sexy sound and smart, witty lyrics.  \\"Ulysses\\", \\"What She Came For\\" , and \\"Live Alone\\" are also destined to be radio hits.
B0029358GM|3.0|They ARE trying to break your heart. I Love Wilco. I am & have always been fond of this lovely band. The are most definitely one of the most musical bands out there, even with some of their most experimental material. With this album, it just sounds like they are playing it way too  safe. It's not a great album. As much as I love the band, I'm not going to be one of those typical fans and say what most people are saying. Hell, I enjoyed the previous record so much more. Yeah, yeah yeah, \\"Yankee..\\" is the masterpiece that everyone knows and loves. However, I did not expect a part 2 nor would I compare it to this album. I just expected more out of this one. Sad to say that I was let down. \\"The Album\\" does have some good songs. They don't really speak to me all that much though & they are mediocre at best.<br />Most of the cuts could easily be thrown away as B-sides. Having said that, I will say that this may be the most<br />accessible Wilco album to date. I am sure they will win over a lot of old farts & a few soccer moms even. Oh well, moving forward I will be more cautious with them: Wilco, a wonderful, unpredictable little band.
B000002LCK|5.0|I had this on vinyl and decided to get CD so I knew it would be great.
B001GCUER0|5.0|Just finished Season 2 DVD of Mad Men and loved it.  I saw no sophomore slump here.  The acting, writing, sets, 60's props and attitudes, all feel so contemporary to that time period.  The show is layered, like a 3-dimensional  puzzle and it's interesting to see how the pieces will fit together.      I did not watch the show on TV at all, but discovered the show through clips on Hulu.  I find most television boring and stupid, but this show is head and shoulders above the rest.    Update 09-08-09.  Just watched most of Season 2 with commentary.  There are two commentary tracks, one with Matt, people behind the scenes and the actors and another without Matt Weiner with actors such as Christina Hendricks, Elisabeth Moss, etc. I found the the commentary by series creator Matt Weiner, along with the director, and the lovely voice of Jon Hamm, fascinating.  Matt gives the viewers so much information about the scene set ups, the filming process, casting, character motivation, stuff that's going on behind the scenes and its as if he's talking directly to you.  The commentary with Robert Morse and Christina Hendricks was so funny, it was like overhearing a conversation between them.  He kept making little jokes to her.  For Mad Men fans, the purchase is worth it just for this feature.
B000002UAX|5.0|If anyone has come to see if a reviewer will say this is the greatest Beatles album of all time, forget it. All of them are great. There is not one I can fault, nor is there one better than another, except to say that Abbey Road is the culmination of all the years of their experiences and definitively who and where they were at the close of the band's existence.    If you don't have this album and you like the Beatles, buy it.    One last note: the assertion that Eric Clapton played the lead for \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" has no fact to back it up. I urge anyone who even likes the Beatles to examine multiple examples of Harrison's work commencing in 1968 until his death. He was very expert in slide work and the lead bears his unmistakable signature.

B000NU2CY4|1.0|What a disappointment for such a heralded and popular film.    This disc is a retread of the 2000 transfer, made for the DVD.  What this means is that considerable edge enhancement (EE), or false sharpness, remains in place.  Universal, in prepping the old, outdated transfer for release, smeared what is called \\"digital noise reduction,\\" or DNR, all over the picture, to remove both the natural film grain that provides facial detail and other wonderful Blu-ray things, as well as cover up the nasty results of EE, which include white halos around most edges.    The result?  A terrible picture:    1. The detail that justifies a Blu-ray upgrade, namely clear backgrounds and great facial detail, is GONE.  It does NOT look like film, and barely upgrades the detail on the DVD.  Yes, it's slightly better, but only because of the increased resolution.  It's a barely noticeable upgrade.    2. Some elements are actually missing!  Like arrows and catapult ammunition.  Gone.  Erased.  Some spears have been magically segmented due to the errors.    In short, DO NOT BUY THIS BLU-RAY.  It is a mere marginal upgrade from the DVD, and you should send a message to Paramount with your wallet.  This is not worthy of the Sapphire label, and is not worthy of your purchase.
0765356147|3.0|Let's be honest. If you've already read the first two books, you are going to read this book for closure. Unfortunately, the price of closure is a pretty mediocre book. While I thought that books one and two were solid \\"4 Star\\" stories, this book fails to follow the trend. I've had problems with the Author's prose in the past (he is always repeating himself...it seems that \\"flat stares\\" are the most common mannerism in this new world), but this book also suffers from failed plot execution and construction.    My first complaint is that I really don't see anything commendable in our heroes. In many ways, this series is about how ideologues must trade in their starry-eyed preconceptions for a hard dose of realism. But time after time, we see that attempts at realism by these characters ends with them causing more misery than good. Their adversaries- both mortal and immortal- continue to outsmart them. This happened a little in book I, but the characters were still masters of their own destiny. In book II, our characters were learning to be leaders, and so we expected them to be out maneuvered regularly. But in Book III, they seem to have gotten even worse, constantly finding themselves reacting to the plans of others. Pretty much every \\"victory\\" they enjoy is completely accidental or the result of machinations started by the benevolent god Preservation or the Lord Ruler a thousand years ago. There is even a sense of Providence as key plot points are advanced by mere coincidence (a certain inquisitor just happens to stumble across a guy with key information. A group of special soldiers just happens to be sent to the Pits of Hathem). As the story unfolds, it seems that the only thing each character really controls is choosing his or her manner of death. Is that really the message our author planned?    While it is nice to have all the secrets and loose ends wrapped up, the Author really seemed heavy-handed. In the first two books, each chapter was headed by almost cryptic sentences from tomes that characters discovered as the plot progressed. In Hero of Ages a similar book is quoted. But this time, the book reads like a detailed manual, explaining how the magic systems work, how the gods Preservation and Ruin work, and using scientific references to microbes and planetary orbits. These revelations are extremely frustrating. While it's cool to get some meat behind the phenomena, we are being told things that the characters have yet to discover.     And so, instead of identifying with the characters' ignorance, we sit- knowing the truth- as they bumble around in mistake after mistake. For instance, we are told many of the secrets of Hemalurgy (the magic used to make Inquisitors) early on in the book, but must suffer through characters constantly wondering about it, or oblivious when it is being used against them.  I knew at the very beginning of the story why Vin can only selectively hear Ruin or use the Mists. It is clear who is being manipulated by the enemy. But worst of all is Sazed. He is undergoing a crisis of faith throughout the entire book. Suddenly, despite decades of training and planning to Preach religions, he is bothered by the internal inconsistencies of all these religions. Throughout the story, he scours his accumulated religions, looking for one that can prove that there is an after-life and a plan. First, this guy has been wading knee deep in SIGNS of the super natural, so he has far more to hang his faith on than any reader expected to identify with him. Second, it is completely silly that a theologian of his learned experience is unable to reconcile the fact that religions- as they are passed on from fallible person to fallible person- might develop some internal inconsistencies. This entire dilemma was frustratingly drawn out and contrived.     All together, this series was a good read. I'd give the entire trilogy 4 stars for an epic story that explores some really cool themes. Unfortunately, this book does more to take away from the trilogy than add to it. While I give Mr Sanderson full marks for his imagination and plot-construction, his execution still needs work. It leaves me torn on whether or not I want to try more of his books...
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Dexter is probably the most addicting series that I can think of in recent years. What makes this series worth watching is the title character who is brilliantly portrayed by Michael C. Hall. Even though he kills people, true they are bad people, you can't help but really like the guy. There are even parts of Dexter that a lot of people can relate to. There are some things in his life that reflects our own experiences but in a much less degree. This season is very well written and always leaves you wanting more.
B000002IV8|5.0|Now I can not say I'm super knowledgeable in the metal genre, but I love this album.  There's awesome tempo, catchy melodies and rhythm and riffs, which is definitely different from the pure thrash where faster is better, but I think that just gets boring.  This is a highly recommended album and I've tried the older Overkill albums and they are not nearly as good as this.<br /><br />Definitely a bargain!  I first heard of Overkill from the Metal Massacre 5 CD and their song \\"Soldier Boy\\" was hot!  This album has that similar feel and sound, I think.
B002FA5NNW|5.0|I read the previous buyer's comment and the DVD has English subtitles.  You have to be illiterate not to know if the subtitle option is not display on the menu then PRESS the subtitle BUTTON on the DVD remote control.  It works!  By the way great movie!

B001AQTWF2|1.0|Finally, after all the hype! A D.O.A. CD. My ears know a studio twinked piece of crap. This is the worst Houston album to date. She needs to pack up her lace wigs, old school gal gowns, pancake makeup and piano key-like false teeth and retire! I was expecting a real comeback. NOT!<br />Crack really is whack after all! It robbed her of her voice and spirit. Sure, the once mighty Houston will chart on top for a short time. Clive Davis will get back some of his front money. But,when it is all said and done, this is a forgettable effort of epic proportion. NOT ONE GRAMMY NOD FOR THIS STINKER.
B00007KWHO|2.0|Yes' first album (\\"Yes\\") may have been a rather jumbled and eager-to-please project filled with missteps and raucous playing, but the thrill is there:  it's forward-leaning, vigorous, and reaching in all directions even if naive, clunky, and comparatively unsophisticated.  \\"Time And A Word\\", on the other hand, desperately wants to take the band to another level before they were ready -- lads trying to run before walking properly.  Unlike King Crimson and ELP, Yes' career did not start with a bang and a distinctive, well-defined sound.  Yes wouldn't get there until their third album.    \\"Time And A Word\\" is Yes' attempt to join the Big League before their time.  And in doing so, they forsake what had probably been their most exciting recording strength:  Peter Banks' electric guitar.  Banks is 6-feet under in the mix, and his absence is such that the album is sucked of all blood and color.  Instead, we get an overbearing orchestra that is upmost in the mix.  It is strident, paper-thin, lifelessly grey and dry, and becomes an interfering irritant that clearly fails to take the music to that other 'level'.  It's like a bumbblebee that won't get out of earshot.  And it's NOTHING like the warm, rich, light-and-shadow strings of the Moody Blues, for example.  Obviously, the producer was out of his depth.  Add to this the criminally tinny sound of Bruford's drums.  Bill plays well enough (although a bit too jazz-cluttery to my ears) but the engineering is flat, zero depth, like someone nervously tapping their fingernails on a formica tabletop. Put another way, the drums feel like they're no larger than a matchbox being rattled into a microphone.  Truly.  Next, Tony Kaye's Hammond on \\"Time And A Word\\" has to be the most off-putting organ sound ever committed to tape -- with all the gravitas of sandpaper on wood, back and forth.  Again, piss-poor engineering. And Squire's bass, well, besides being disproportionately loud like the orchestra (he was buddies with the producer say the bios), there's a juvenile self-indulgence in the need for showiness. Spare me Chris. Finally, although Anderson is already a competent singer, his style is not yet unique.  Strangely, he even comes across as hoarse throughout the album.  His effortless and spectacular soaring voice excursions ain't on this platter.    Try as it might, \\"Time And A Word\\" would never become a close contender to KC's \\"In The Court of the Crimson King\\", which was Yes' stated goal at the time (again, the bios).  It tries too hard.  It lacks unity and direction.  It's painfully transitional.  It's bombastic without ever being grand.  In fact, because of one-dimensional engineering, it even sounds 'small' and dwarfish.  Further, it makes the wrong choices in the mix.  And the orchestra is a pretentious and ineptly handled gimmick that plainly backfires.  In spite of the lofty scheme behind the project, this is still an album by a minor league band.    It's too bad Banks got the boot after this recording since his playing is barely featured in the final product.  If \\"Time And A Word\\" flops, it's hardly because of him.  A guitar oriented sound, in fact, may have saved the record.  Yes wouldn't learn from its mistakes until the third album, \\"The Yes Album\\", which finally sees the boys producing bona fide classic progressive rock without going pompous...or resorting to gimmicks.      I haven't been able to listen to \\"Time And A Word\\" in its entirety since the 70's.  It's that stilted.  It was a disappointment then and has not aged well since.  Isn't it time we got a re-engineering and re-mixing (not a mere re-mastering) minus the cardboard orchestra and with Banks on top, as it was originally done?  C'mon, give the guy a chance.

0307269981|5.0|This book can stand alone, but why let it?  It will read much better if you've read its precursor, \\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\".  That will give you a better flavor of the major players.<br /><br />If you have read \\"Dragon Tattoo\\", comparisons are inevitable.  This book is a much faster-paced mystery with one major theme (\\"Tattoo\\" had a few mystery plots going).  The theme in \\"Fire\\" is all centered around the girl - Lisbeth - who is a wonderfully complex character.  Of course, Larsson can not keep things simple.  Although the mystery surrounds three murders, it is layered with sub-plots surrounding Lisbeth's long sordid past.<br /><br />It is common to say that a book's characters are \\"not cardboard cut-outs\\".  Larsson's characters are even far deeper.  Every character, no matter how minor or tangential is given a real personality, for good of for bad and the book has many characters.  He does this so well though, that it adds to the book rather than burdening it.<br /><br />A rare mystery can hold a reader spellbound for 503 pages, but this one does.  The layers unpeel like an onion and twists and turns never stop as Lisbeth, Mickeal, the police and others all are seeking the truth - and each other.  Very highly recommended.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Kelly Clarkson? Oh, how cute. Keri Hilson? Just adorable. Step aside. Jordin Sparks? Come back in a few years. Rihanna? Never in this lifetime.<br /><br />After all this time, including seven years since 2002's uneven grab-bag \\"Just Whitney,\\" the incomparable Whitney Houston shows up with her shining new studio album \\"I Look to You\\" and proves she has a talent that simply refuses to be written off.<br /><br />It is true that Houston's voice is not the unstoppable instrument that it was 20 years ago. How many singers retain the full range, vibrato and ebullience of their youth into midlife? It is unfair to compare this fine vocalist, who tosses aside her younger chart rivals like nail clippings, to her 25-year-old self.<br /><br />The plum list of top song writing talent on \\"I Look to You\\" - R. Kelly, Johnta Austin and Diane Warren being some of the most notable names - give Houston plush, state of the art material to wrap her signature voice around, and for the first time in eons she sounds maximally invested in savoring each syllable and absolutely delivering.<br /><br />What makes \\"I Look for You\\" particularly remarkable is how the self-conscious biographical thread the songwriters help Houston weave comes off seamlessly and without an ounce of pretense. Not only is this an unabashed comeback album, but Houston is ready to hit the clubs with her girlfriends, celebrate life and acknowledge her past missteps with a look to the future. This particularly informs the Alicia Keys-penned feel-good club thumper \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" and R. Kelly's soul-searching \\"Salute,\\" both of which bookend the disc.<br /><br />Houston's voice soars confidently with boundless joie de vivre. The kinetic \\"Nothin' But Love,\\" which packs the nervous, unrelenting urgency of a ticking time bomb, is a particularly fine example. \\"There've been haters since this world's been goin' round\\" she confidently sings. \\"Why they take a dream and try to push it down? I ain't even tryin' to hold on to that now. I ain't got nothin' got nothin' but love for ya.\\"<br /><br />The songs rub against each other ideally. The emotionally manipulative yet achingly beautiful R. Kelly-penned titled track fits snugly between the warm island breeze of \\"Like I Never Left\\" featuring Akon (which is perhaps the most transparent example here of art imitating life) and the Stargate-produced velvety slow burn that is \\"Call You Tonight.\\" The latter has the power to burn up the charts for months on end. Even the overly syrupy Diane Warren ballad \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" is an above-average selection, well-complemented by the mood of tracks that surround it.<br /><br />Houston reminds that covering Leon Russell's unceasingly poignant classic \\"A Song for You\\" is worthwhile when the interpretive talent of the vocalist is sufficient. The choice to infect a portion of the song with hot dance beats (again, courtesy of Stargate) works surprisingly well. Other tracks, including the life-affirming \\"I Got You,\\" which Houston co-penned, maintain the quality.<br /><br />Whether \\"I Look to You\\" guzzles Grammys or falls off the charts in a matter of weeks, what really matters has already been accomplished - Houston has achieved a stunning, moving, entertaining return to form. She not only meets expectations but surpasses them.<br /><br />Welcome home, Whitney. Please have a seat and stay awhile.r ya.\\"  The songs rub against each other ideally.

B002M5ZCEU|5.0|A comeback?  Sure - why not call it what it officially is?  The twist, though, is that she's come back to collect those long-lost R&B fans who thought she'd neglected them when her albums were so successful that they were \\"considered\\" Pop.  And perhaps they were.  But this album is R&B at best.  Classic R&B.  And the genius behind the direction of this album - Mr. Clive Davis - needs to be commended.  It was genius to make this such an autobiographical album and stamp it R&B, which is definitely fast becoming a lost genre.  And who better to restore R&B back to it's natural habitat other than Whitney?  She is the one person (and Luther Vandross - in absentia) who's worthy and able to resuscitate it.  Kudos to Mr. Davis for strategically plotted this comeback album.  We all know that there is plenty of time for Whitney to renew her vows to the Pop genre and, if we're lucky, grace us with another Soundtrack.  But first she would lay out her soul on the altar of R&B and deliver a very soulful, emotionally-charged and autobiographical album to us, her congregation of fans who were praying for this very time in her life.       For at least a decade we've been panting like deer for her to quench our thirst for that authentic, soulful, vocal vibrato for which this songbird has neglected us.  And for at least that long, we've had to suffer through studio-enhanced mannequins (like - dare I say - Rihanna and Ciara, et al.) who are known more for and influenced by their high-fashion than a shred of true musical talent.  Although Whitney did leave huge, practically unattainable footsteps for them to follow in.  Not just anyone can bless the world with a catalogue of music that serves as the soundtrack to the lives of a generation like Whitney has.    So I say, yes indeed this is a comeback.  Much deserved.  Highly-anticipated.  And worth the very, very, very long wait.    We will always LOVE YOU, Ms. Whitney Houston.  Congrats!    ***For those whom don't yet appreciate this CDbecause it's too R&B for Whitney, give it another chance - this time concentrating on the lyrics of tracks 2, 4, 5, 10 and 11.  You can feel the heartache, deliverance and triumph of the master of her craft.
B001PR0YBM|3.0|[FOREWORD: Boy, did I have an amusing theatrical experience.  When I was going to the theater to see this film, I went inside the auditorium, and there were actually children watching an anime movie for once. I must say it's rather appropriate, but at the same time, I then had to deal with their constant whining and begging for mom's milk during the film's important scenes.  Truthfully, they didn't bother me too much as their distractions didn't ruin my movie experience in any way.]<br /><br />Oh, Miyazaki.  You never let me down...until now, but only a bit.  A slight bit, a minute splinter under my skin...yet it still bothers me.  When I read about \\"Ponyo\\", the next Studio Ghibli project, I wasn't too impressed.  The film didn't look like it'll rekindle the flame that Miyazaki's [[ASIN:B00005JLEU award-winning film]] sparked, and its sole objective is to appeal to the general audience; to Disney's marketing-focus credit, the film did manage to do okay in the U.S. box office.  My admiration for the director usually does away with my negative first impressions, so I watched \\"Ponyo\\" with my mind as clear as the open sky.<br /><br />The story is an amalgamation of [[ASIN:014036708X certain]] [[ASIN:0698400011 fairy]] [[ASIN:0794519172 tales]] with a touch of \\"An Inconvenient Truth.\\"  It's straightforward: boy meets girl fish, girl fish loves boy, girl fish wants to be human like boy, girl fish becomes human, then the ocean ecosystem is disrupted, causing damage beyond geological proportions due to the actions of girl fish.  A simple tale, indeed.  Usually, the premise screams out thrills, suspense, and a compelling adventure, but color me surprised because the movie doesn't have any; it has the adventure part, but it wasn't all that exciting which sadly reinforces my initial impressions.<br /><br />Although I try my best to suspend disbelief, I did unsuspend when the human characters aren't so bothered by the unusual chain of events.  Sosuke, the male lead, I can believe due to his youth and innocence, but his mother seems all too humble about the sight of a goldfish WITH A HUMAN FACE AND EATS HAM IN ONE BITE; I don't know about her, but I would be amazed by that.  The rest of villagers acted the same way (not just for the fish), in fact, the only character I can identify with is the cranky old lady because even she notices something is wrong with this whole thing.<br /><br />Ponyo herself is an intriguing character, though.  Although the US trailers did their very poorest to hide her human form (the trailers for \\"The Last Unicorn\\" and even \\"Shrek II\\" kept that surprise hidden), when she became one, she possesses magic that does unusual things: she can make things five times its size, she can cure the sick by rubbing her face on their faces, not to mention she can control the ocean if she likes.  She's a flipping miracle worker, a divine creature whom I am totally not comparing to certain [[ASIN:B00028HBIO religious]] [[ASIN:0792154649 figures]].  Conversely, her mother, The Goddess of the Sea, provides no significant purpose for the whole film.  She was mentioned as a serious threat, but all she did was play a beautiful spectator.  Another thing, if she's the Goddess of the Sea, why didn't she stop that tsunami her daughter is causing?  What, was she wasting time at home watching Grey's Anatomy or the show's equivalent in Japan?<br /><br />I'm aware this isn't the type of Ghibli film that would tug my heartstrings with the characters' obstacles for them to walk the path of self-worth.  This is a lighter film, something for everyone who's afraid of a little danger.  There were previous Ghibli films that were also light in tone, but this film neither has the obstruction of \\"Kiki's Delivery Service\\" nor the wonder of \\"My Neighbor Totoro.\\"  There was a lot of magic, but not a lot of mystery; the movie constantly shows off on its vibrant displays that there's no subtlety.  Some circumstances, such as the elixir scene and the cautionabout the moon falling, were abruptly told just to keep the momentum.<br /><br />Personally, these young leads didn't really learn anything from their experience.  Ponyo's wizard of a father said Sosuke must overcome a challenge to test his love for Ponyo, but I don't know what challenge it is; all I saw was those two walking in a tunnel.  Finally, there was the climax which was really a simple \\"yes or no\\" question, something the kid could've answered 30 minutes ago because he sure he didn't act any different than he was at this point.  Also, outside of the scene where Sosuke's mom acts like a proper parent and drive flooded roads during a heavy tsunami with her son unbuckled (mother of the year), the film lack any kind of tension as the film rather sails away for a good second-half, literally.  I know this is a G-rated movie, but come on, at least startle me a bit.<br /><br />To its merit, \\"Ponyo\\" is amazing to look at; the use of watercolors is simply exquisite, so kids are going to like what they see.  However, I don't praise a film for looks like I used to.  Sometimes, I want something more from my film than just how it dresses itself.  The story isn't enlightening to grab my attention, the characters weren't interesting to grow attached to them, and I felt indifferent about the marvels it showed.  Even as an animated film by Hayao Miyazaki, I can't give it a free pass.<br /><br />By the way, Disney. That Ponyo theme remix...shame on you.ly told just to keep the momentum.

1932073221|5.0|I have purchased a replacement copy of this book because I wore the first one out. My old copy was in pieces and yet I was still reading the individual pages one at a time. There is not a lot that is new in this book, but the way in which it is stated makes one wonder why one hasn't implemented these techniques before. It is a wonderful recap of the thought processes involved in creating abundance. I highly recommend not only reading, but studying this book. The exercises included at the end of each chapter are also helpful in implementing the techniques.

B001AQTWF2|3.0|I bought the album because I am pulling for Whitney, unconditionally. The reviews describing many of the songs as underwhelming are pretty accurate. But I was struck by \\"I Look to You.\\" No matter how much work was done in the studio to even it out and polish it up, there is still an undeniable \\"Whitney-ness\\" to it. You can't manufacture her emotion,  artistry or masterful sublety. What courage it would take to work through the pain and regrets of the last several years, to risk public criticism ... all to create a few moments of beauty. Great effort, Whitney. Go slowly, take good care of yourself, and when you are ready, give us more. We will be be waiting!

B00140PK6O|5.0|Loved this story and character development of the ladies and people of Cranford!  It's one of my favorites and will rank up there with the long version of Pride and Prejudice!
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind is probably one of the most beautifully written books I have ever encountered. It's heartbreaking, it's passionate and lusty, it's full of rich descriptions of people, places (it is a haunting, historical love/hate letter to war torn Barcelona-top on my travel list), and thoughts. Ultimately, it renews, despite every heart-wrenching event, renews your faith in the human condition.<br /><br />In terms of the authors so may reviewers like to compare Zafon with, TSOTW is very much like Borges, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, but it's nowhere near as full of vague, pretentiously academic psychobabble as Eco.<br /><br />The characters are deep, and as many people have mentioned, Fermin is sure to be one of your favorite characters of all time. I marked many of his witticisms and musings as I went along.<br /><br />What is most surprising in this story is the fact that the writing is so beautiful and the story so fascinating that you often forget it is a mystery. And a twisted, unpredictable one at that. The sense of tension, of foreboding, is so intense, that with every turn of the page I felt like something terrifying might happen. This is one way to guarantee a page turner.<br /><br />Additionally, if you love books, if you love literature and the mystery that is the life of a used book before fate dumped it unceremoniously into your hands, then TSOTW is most certainly for you.<br /><br />One complaint-I do wish Zafon had developed a few things in the book more, like the protagonist's father, but, this was sacrificed for complete development of what you would think should be minor characters.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Absolutely love this movie!  It's still the best version of Persuasion made (including over the most recent 2008 version).  The novel is my favorite of all of Jane Austen's works. The acting is superb and the movie follows closely to that of the book.  One can appreciate the \\"realness\\" of living through this time period, as the movie well-portrayed, and be moved by the love-story!  It's not the typical \\"holly-wood\\" filming, but that makes it more believable and the actors respond naturally, not rehearsed, making the story feel as though it is captured in real time.  (The music is also well-done - classical piano.)

B001AQTWF2|4.0|Whitney Houston's first album since 2002's [[ASIN:B00006HCUW Just Whitney]] is destined to become a hit.  It isn't because [[ASIN:B001AQTWF2 I Look to You]] is a revolutionary R&B album or Houston's strongest work, but because R&B's leading lady has finally returned after a seven-year hiatus.  And let's face it, 2002's Just Whitney didn't allure us the way that 1998's [[ASIN:B00000DFRS My Love Is Your Love]], which was a huge multi-platinum hit fueled by hit single \\"It's Not Right But It's OK\\". That album arrived after a shocking eight-year hiatus from the diva. Honestly, I Look To You turns out to be surprisingly good considering many people doubted if Whitney Houston 'still had it'.  Sure, I Look to You lacks some of the unrequited passion of Whitney's heyday, but one must remember that Whitney's last modern hit was 1998's My Love is Your Love.  I Look To You also doesn't possess a hit the likes of \\"It's Not Right, But It's OK\\", but at this point, fans are happy that one of the best R&B singers of all time has returned back to the spotlight.  'Flaws and all', I don't think anyone would deny that a purchase of Whitney Houston's comeback album would be a waste of time, money, or energy.<br /><br />The album opens up strongly with the Alicia Keys co-penned \\"Million Dollar Bill\\".  \\"Million Dollar Bill\\" benefits from sound production work with an old-school R&B feel, which was made for Houston to sing.  While it is obvious this song was written by Keys, Houston sings it extremely well and successfully exerts her own influence.  Sure, it may not be the quite the same Houston who sang the chilling \\"I Will Always Love You\\", but this Houston here still showcases a strong talent and clearly proves that drug-use, a failed marriage, and a ridiculous reality show didn't killer her prodigious vocal talents.<br /><br />\\"Nothin' But Love\\" is OK, but it is the slightest bit clunky to my ear.  I don't particularly buy the song 100% itself, but it isn't horrible by any means.  Whitney does OK with it, but I would've love to have had a slightly more energized track that may have been better tempered to Houston. The production is strong, reminiscent of numerous Whitney Houston remixes that have appeared throughout the years (\\"I'm Every Woman\\" or \\"Step By Step from [[ASIN:0793577497 The Preacher's Wife]]).  \\"Call You Tonight\\" is more well rounded and Whitney generally sounds stronger and more herself on it.  It possesses the adult-contemporary R&B sound that propelled Whitney in her heyday and even in the 1990s.  It and the exceptionally R. Kelly penned first single \\"I Look To You\\" are certainly not going to lure a new generation to Whitney Houston - particularly given the hip-hop R&B dominated market - but it should lay well at adult R&B stations.<br /><br />\\"I Look To You\\" is understated for R. Kelly, but it serves well for Whitney as it allows her to showcase her brilliant voice.  Sure, you don't get the goosebumps you got when you listened to a power-ballad like her ubiquitous \\"I Will Always Love You\\" or the touching \\"One Moment In Time\\", but \\"I Look To You\\" seems the most representative of Whitney Houston of the entire album; it features the most authenticity.<br /><br />\\"Like I Never Left\\" featuring Akon is a great concession to a more modern R&B sound, though it doesn't ever concede as it is plenty 'adult' enough in sound as it hip-enough for a younger generation.  It isn't a crossover hit by any means, but it may have the most potential to break the hip-hop barrier.  \\"A Song For You\\" is lovely, though the disco-production wasn't necessary.  It doesn't 'corrupt' the song (though many pundits will chide it), but it would've been fine if Whitney had maintained the authenticity of the original.  Either way, I personally think Houston does fine with the classic soul song.<br /><br />\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" one-ups \\"A Song For You\\", proving to be another authentic Whitney Houston performance.  One wishes more of the big ballads had beenplaced on this album as they truly showcase Houston at her best.  \\"Worth It\\" is a great contemporary R&B track, and proves to be one of the very best of I Look To You. Houston sounds fantastic here and I could truly see this making a fine single for Houston.  The production is great - among the best of the album.  \\"For The Lovers\\" proves to be another production standout.  Again placing Houston against a dance-backdrop, it falls flatter than the ballads, though it is no means bad.  However, when you consider a \\"dance-tastic\\" Houston, you think of her takes on \\"I'm Every Woman\\" or \\"Step By Step\\". Either way, \\"For The Lovers\\" is by all means enjoyable.<br /><br />\\"I Got You\\" is solid by all means and serves as a good, though not show-stealing penultimate track.  \\"I Salute\\" ends the album on a high note and proves to be one of the best tracks on I Look To You.<br /><br />I Look To You, by all means, proves to be solid.  It isn't Whitney's best nor her worst, though I would suspect that she will garner a couple of Grammy nominations.  It is, if nothing else, a good solid effort from a legendary R&B singer.  Even though \\"I Look To You\\" isn't nearly as memorable as anything from Houston's path, it shows that everyone's favorite female adult-R&B singer 'still has it'.  3.5 stars.uly showcase Houston at her best.  \\"Worth It\\" is a great contemporary R&B track, and proves to be one of the very best of I Look To You.

B001QTXM5Y|3.0|Thanks to a string of successful comic book movie hits, directors are finally showing some respect for their original source material.  In the past, it was clear that the director's vision eclipsed any fan interest, which resulted in the Batman series kicked off by Tim Burton eventually circling the toilet bowl before being flushed by Joel Schumacher.  The tide has reversed, with fanboys-turned-directors like Peter Jackson, Robert Rodriguez, and Guillermo del Toro showing an almost slavish devotion to the source material. Zack Snyder can now add his name to that list.<br /><br />Watchmen takes place in an alternate reality where the threat of weapons of mass destruction looms large, thanks in part to superheroes who range in sanction from government agents to violent outlaws. They are gods among men, these superheroes, but they are also deeply flawed human beings.  Watchmen is their story.<br /><br />There's remarkably little superhero-action in Watchmen.  When you strip away all the distractions like the altered timeline and the murder mystery, it becomes clear that Watchmen is actually a character study.  The film ping-pongs between each character's backstory, slowly peeling back each layer until we get to the conclusion: that people do terrible things for good reasons. Unfortunately, some characters are fleshed out more than others.<br /><br />Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley), the Question-like stand-in, is the most interesting character, an anti-hero filled with the rage of moral absolutism, right at home in a repressive society. He also provides noir-style narrative throughout Watchmen.<br /><br />Nite Owl II (Patrick Wilson), who has an uncanny resemblance to a young Chevy Chase, is basically an alternative Batman in search of a cause.  He's largely a cipher here, cast primarily as the potential love interest of Silk Spectre.<br /><br />Silk Spectre II (Malin Akerman) provides the emotional center of the film but unfortunately doesn't do much for women's rights - she comes off as emotionally conflicted and petulant.<br /><br />The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Punisher analogue whose death at the beginning of the film provides much of the movie's structure, is also a relative unknown.  His nickname is derived from his sociopathic detachment, killing with glee.  Unfortunately, he just comes off as a murderous thug.<br /><br />Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is perfect as a mildly contemptuous superhuman, more alien and powerful than Superman. His mere existence can cause nations to go to war.  Unfortunately, the film struggles with defining the limits of his powers - I half expected Manhattan to change time and space (like Superman did in the 1978 film) to \\"fix\\" things.<br /><br />Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), perhaps the most important character in the film, is inexplicably both the most brilliant man on earth and a supreme martial artist.

Unfortunately, it is no longer revolutionary as it might have been, because the 80s comic laid the framework for serious superhero comics that came later, which in turn spawned serious superhero movies like The Dark Knight.

The Comedian (Jeffrey Dean Morgan), a Punisher analogue whose death at the beginning of the film provides much of the movie's structure, is also a relative unknown.  His nickname is derived from his sociopathic detachment, killing with glee.  Unfortunately, he just comes off as a murderous thug.      Dr. Manhattan (Billy Crudup) is perfect as a mildly contemptuous superhuman, more alien and powerful than Superman. His mere existence can cause nations to go to war.  Unfortunately, the film struggles with defining the limits of his powers - I half expected Manhattan to change time and space (like Superman did in the 1978 film) to \\"fix\\" things.    Ozymandias (Matthew Goode), perhaps the most important character in the film, is inexplicably both the most brilliant man on earth and a supreme martial artist. There's nothing in Ozymandias' background to explain why this is.  His complete lack of development compared to the other characters is where Watchmen stumbles.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I cannot recommend this game high enough for gamers 13 and older. I'd even recommend it for kids as young as 8 or adults in 50s! I originally bought this on the recommendations of friends. After one game, I couldn't stop thinking about it. After 3, I wanted to try all the variant play styles. After 5, I decided I would have to buy the extension and get a copy for my school's gaming club.  I'd go more into gameplay, but there are other reviews that cover that. On thing I LOVED is that everything has its own spot in the box, it comes with its own resealable bags, AND there's loads of extra room in the box!    LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This video is awesome! I feel the burn after five minutes, but then there are only 15 minutes left to go!  I love jillian!  I started with 3lb weights and that was good for me.
630463949X|5.0|This is a great video of The Dance.  It has all the songs from the concert, which the CD doesn't have.  It's also interesting to watch them interact on stage.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|It's great to see and hear she's back but that's not enough. The CD is OK but I was expecting something better (songs and production). The voice is different. She's still a good singer, better than many but the voice sounds tired and cold, not convinced or maybe too stressed-out for the pressure of doing something perfect. I don't like the single \\"I look to you\\", is the song where her voice sounds worse, raspy, different and the lyrics are obvious, neither I like \\"I didn't know...\\" (I prefer the remix version). I do like \\"Nothin' but love\\", \\"Call you tonight\\", \\"Like I never felt\\", \\"Worth it\\" not because they are great songs but because they are funnier than the rest. The other songs are mostly boring for a come back album. Today that you can choose the songs in you ipod creating a playlist, from this new album I will pick up only the four songs I mentioned and the remix (maybe).<br />No matter what she will sell millions of CDs this time and we all will be waiting for a new album where Whitney Houston can shine with all her talent and confidence.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Great movie - one of the best ever.  I think this will go on to be a classic.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I'm obsessed with the score of this movie.  It completely follows the madness of Daniel Day Lewis.
B001KEGRCA|5.0|Got this disc primarily to inspect video quality and it did not disappoint.  The visuals are incredible on this bluray disc and the soundtrack is perfect.  The story does get preachy at times but the visuals kept me glued for the duration.  Highly recommended.
B000CZ0Q5W|5.0|I was looking for specific CD's and was able to find them easily, I appreciate that. The people sending them were quick, much faster then usual,that is the best.  The item was in excellent shape and there is nothing I wanted to know, it was all there for me!    Debbie
0307266303|5.0|This book answers many questions.    Why would I, with injury prone feet, switch to nearly barefoot running? [...]  And, why would my feet suddenly be the best they have been in ages?  According to many legends, tribesmen would run after deer until their \\"hooves fell off\\" - is this possible?  How?  Why would anyone risk everything (including their life) to live with an ancient tribe, called the \\"running people\\" in the copper canyons of Mexico?  Why is it that the more expensive running shoe you buy, the more likely it is you will get injured?       (And why do the shoe companies not want you to know?  Although that answer is obvious I suppose)    All these questions and many more are answered in the book \\"Born to Run\\"    The first time I read this book one month ago, I devoured it.  I started out slowly, but then became caught up in the story, and soon was neglecting work and home duties to find out \\"what happened next\\".   And then to go through it again, I listened to the audio book and I learned so much more... more about... well many things including things about me.    It is about \\"running\\" and how to run.    I learned why I got hurt running and how to run LOTS MORE with even more joy.    Wait, it isn't just about that, not really (although that is in there.)    It is a mystery story about seeking through a lost tribe, our lost heritage as species, and what those losses mean --- and that what we have lost is really still available to all of us!    Yet, that isn't the only story.   It is an adventure story about people traveling deep into the Copper Canyons of Mexico and discovering the past, and more importantly discovering themselves.  There is yet a deeper, more important message.    This book contains the story of many people who literally risked their livelihood and their lives, to pursue \\"truth\\", to pursue the deepest passion within them.    What they gained, in my view, was so much more valuable then wealth.       Chris McDougall tells a riveting true story that follows the path of a some very intriguing peoples and the paths they follow to one of the greatest ultra-marathons every held.   An ultra-marathon run that only a hand full of people saw.   I can't say more about this -- the joy of discovering this through reading is amazing.       This is not a book just for runners  I believe this is an adventure story that speaks to many people.    (However, I am a runner.     And this is the BEST running book I have ever read and I think I have read almost all of them.     It would be great for a \\"non-runner\\" to read this and let me know if it was good and interesting.)
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Jordan G. Roselle I love your review. I also have both the X4 and the X41 and could not agree with you more. It is a huge improvement. I would highly recomend upgrading if you have the X4 since the X41 address all the issues that X4 had. The sound is much better as well. I tried several games last night and could not beleive the improvement. I am selling my my old set on Ebay so they should go for about 130.00. It is well worth the 70.00 to upgrade.
B0021L8US0|2.0|What a shame. Another almost complete waste of time, reminiscent of the drab failure that was Children of Men. Here is a movie with so much potential, made with vast resources, whose more thoughtful scenes are completely eclipsed by the maniacal militaristic behaviour of the film's most poorly cast characters. In other words, whatever story might have been trying to come out of this meeting between aliens and humans was submerged more or less completely by all the bang, bang, bang arising from some truly mediocre scriptwriting. Or am I being too hard. Perhaps the moronic interactions of the tough guys in this film is exactly what the modern audience requires? If so, I wish there was some way of warning viewers who would like to see a film with some content, minus the blood, gore and guts produced by the hyperactive Hollywood nincompoops who make this kind of movie.    On the high side, the lead character is excellent as far as he is allowed to go, but the positions in which he finds himself create outlets for some truly disturbed thinking, in spite of the basic premise (the film did have potential, yes), which was not without interest. Yet are we really being asked to reflect on the meaning of human/alien relationships, which thought is mooted ever so gently near the beginning; are we really being asked to consider how much we have changed since the bad old days of the Johannesburg townships in the apartheid era (which are perhaps not really over, even yet)... No. In fact, we are simply blasted out of our seats and any value (or values) that the film set out to conjure with (or define) disappears in the vapid meanderings of an endless chasse à l'homme, which I'm sorry to say, we have all seen too many times before. I could go on to point out how the display of what is supposed to be advanced alien technology is really being used to show how clever the film's special effects people are, and so on, but I won't. The film could be dismantled further but it is hardly worth the effort. Truly unimaginative celluloid muck at its very best. As I say, what a shame.
B000WZB944|5.0|Before this monster classic album came out in 1987, I was already familiar with this   powerful irish band's work from their \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" and \\"WAR\\" albums.  The band's writing and playing had gotten better & better every year and Bono's  sex appeal and voice was at full throttle! His performance at 1985's LIVE-AID  will attest to that! (-:   Then in 1987, enter \\"The Joshua Tree\\" with it's   anthemic songs, otherworldy vibe, killer production, stellar execution by the band  and those great videos that were playing on MTV, VH-1 and Friday Night Videos   in heavy rotation! This album shot up the charts and became an iconic 80's stadium rock   classic almost instantly!---The tour for this album was amazing!    \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", \\"With Or Without You\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found What   I'm Looking For\\" and on and on...they were all well recieved!  A genuine piece of late 80's rock art.  Now fast forward 20+ years later, and they are now considered as rock icons and   elder statesmen, they have conquered the music world, won countless grammys and   accolades, and Bono has elevated himself into a respected player on the world stage   with his many philanthropic and humanitarian efforts.  This album has been remastered and expanded now into a 2CD set with lots   of extras that I really enjoy listening to, and the quality of the remastering sounds   great on my house system as well as in my car.  It was well worth the money that I paid for it!
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Unbelievable!     Gladiator was the film that I was looking forward to the most when I got into \\"High Def\\". Ironically after waiting for Gladiator to be released in High Definition, now that I have see seen this \\"blu-ray\\", I AM STILL WAITING FOR GLADIATOR TO BE RELEASED IN HIGH DEFINITION! I don't know if this transfer was meant as a joke or not, but after watching the blu-ray and DVD side by side, the difference is so minimal that it is really making me rethink any catalog repurchase on Blu.
B000002MJC|5.0|After \\"Violator\\" (My #1 Favorite DM CD) hit in late '89/early '90, I was rife and   ready to hear what they were going to come up with next!---Then in summer 1993   came \\"Songs Of Faith & Devotion\\", which had a much more darker and ominous vibe   to it than \\"Violator\\"(s) more upbeat futuristic vibe had.  I later found out that Dave Gahan, the lead singer was dealing with serious addictions  during this period that were jeopardizing everything that they had built from  1984's \\"Black Celebration\\" to \\"Violator\\"...hence the darker vibe I felt.  At first I didn't like it...I listened to it about 5 or 6 times, then relegated it   to my \\"hardly played\\" CD pile, where it stayed for about 8 yrs until 2001.   Then one day I was preparing to take a bunch of my old CD's to a swap-n-sell place   when I decided to give \\"S.O.F.& D.\\" another spin with more mature ears.   Wouldn't you know it?---I had grown into it by then, and it has since become my   second favorite DP CD of their 25+ year catalogue!  I guess kind of like Billie Holiday and other great artists who've battled   addiction, Dave's voice was raw, weathered, and telling of the inner turmoil  he was experiencing at that time. (Thank goodness he got through it!)  But his voice has an otherworldly quality to it on this album, which I  like to say is like \\"If Edgar Allen Poe could've been a 90's rock star,  this is how his melancholy would've sounded!\\"     \\"Exciter\\", their 2001 return to great form, is my 3rd Favorite BTW!! (-:   I still love the vibe of \\"I Feel You\\", \\"Walkin In My Shoes\\", \\"Condemnation\\", \\"Judas\\"  and the others which escape me right now, but long story short...this is a damn good CD!
B001FBSMF8|5.0|I was on Peace & Lovefestival this summer in my hometown Borlange. Chris Cornell was one of the many artists. I had to buy this record and I´m very glad for that :-)
B000002L7Y|5.0|Man, Man, Man!!--I was clubbin' and giggin' strong when this album dropped back in 1985!<br />This is one of my favorite albums of the 80's techno-pop genre that was strong at the time.<br />For a techno project, it proved that it was possible to be soulful while embracing the<br />technology of the time, and it also had some great songs to sustain that theory!<br />I'm sure all of you 40-50 yr old Gen-Xers remember when it's lead single,<br />the eternally perky \\"Take On Me\\", with it's innovative video, was getting major play<br />on MTV and Friday Night Videos, as well as in the clubs all over the U.S. and Europe!<br />I was 21 yrs old when this album came out and playing keys & synths for a band who<br />played top 40 hits in clubs and private functions up and down the eastcoast, so it<br />was essential for me to learn how to program in order to achieve the sound textures<br />on this album. A-HA's \\"Hunting High & Low\\", DM's \\"Black Celebration\\" and Kraftwerk's<br />\\"Electric Cafe\\" definitely put me through my paces as a keyboardist! (-:<br />Of course, some of these sounds are cheesy & dated by today's standards, but the vibe<br />of these classic techo-pop albums are eternal!<br />But much more than \\"Take On Me\\", my favorite song from this album was<br />the epic \\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\"!!--Which had drama to burn!<br /><br />When I first heard this song, on a monster club system, in a slighty altered state,<br />I felt as though I had left my body! (-: In fact, that song made me buy this album<br />on both vinyl (for the house) as well as on cassette for my car!<br />Every now and then, when waxing nostalgic for the 80's, I'll put this album on (now I have the CD)<br />and I still find that \\"Take On Me\\", \\"Train Of Thought\\", \\"Hunting High & Low\\", \\"Blue Sky\\",<br />\\"The Sun Always Shines On TV\\", \\"And You Tell Me\\",  \\"I Dream Myself Alive\\" and the highly<br />underrated \\"Here I Stand & Face The Rain\\" still make my head bob and a smile comes over<br />my face some 24 yrs later. This is defintely a classic and a techno-pop masterpiece!
B0021L9ME6|1.0|There are SO many more movies more deserving of a blu-ray upgrade than this one.  Who MAKES these decisions?
B000NU2CY4|1.0|Very bad Picture Quality!    I was excited to buy this blu ray, but then I started looking at the reviews.  The picture has been treated with EE (edge enhancement), (DNR) digital noise reduction, and other filters which make the picture quality much worse than it should be.  Looking at screen captures, this is very obvious. One such glaring errors is a large numbers of arrows are erased from a shot because of what is believed to be a scratch removal filter.  I await a good transfer and will most likely buy that day one.

B001OQCV9M|5.0|Nora Ephron's \\"Julie and Julia\\" is the story of two women who seem to have nothing in common except for a passionate love of cooking.  Julie Powell, played with sweetness and vulnerability by the adorable Amy Adams, has a depressing and low paying job fielding heartrending telephone calls from 9/11 victims.  She lives with her devoted husband, Eric (Chris Messina), in a tiny, rundown apartment above a pizzeria in Queens.  She feels despondent and rudderless until she starts a cooking blog in 2002.  From there, she moves on to an even bigger challenge.  She will prepare all 524 recipes from Child's \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" in 365 days.  Julie's story is juxtaposed with that of Julia Child, whom we meet when she moves to Paris with her husband, Paul (the marvelous Stanley Tucci) in the forties.  Like Julie Powell, Julia felt vaguely dissatisfied with her life.  A class at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris (where she was not welcomed) not only taught Child French cooking, but also led to her collaboration with two French women in writing her iconic book.<br /><br />Meryl Streep is perfection as Child, an ebullient and energetic individual with an insatiable appetite for food and a deep love for the man who was always there for her.  She pranced around a scenic Paris with zest, shopping for ingredients and lovingly preparing gorgeous meals for her friends and family.  All was not sweetness and light, however.  Ironically, Child was childless, and cooking was the outlet that she needed to feel useful and creative.  Ephron moves back and forth in time, showing how Julie connects almost telepathically with Julia through the food that she prepares.  With manic intensity, she agonizes over her cooking successes and failures, to the point where she almost drives Eric away with her intense self-absorption.<br /><br />\\"Julie and Julia\\" is funny, poignant, and immensely entertaining.  The director elicits wonderful performances from her leads, and with cinematic trickery, she even manages to make Streep appear to be over six feet tall.  Not only is this an engrossing character study, but the film is also an inspiring exploration of how an ordinary person can bring her dreams to fruition if she has the gumption and tenacity to overcome obstacles and continue to believe in herself.  Although their lives were not perfect, Julie and Julia found bliss through food and they generously shared their joy with the world.o make Streep appear to be over six feet tall.

B002HQWQOI|5.0|A RE-RELEASE (AT A REASONABLE PRICE) OF A 1989 ZELENKA-BERNIUS RECORDING<br /><br />If Handel and Bach are the first two members of the Baroque Musical Trinity, then Jan Dismas Zelenka (1679-1745) must be the third.  For this recording displays most of the attributes that define 'greatness'.  It gave me seventy minutes of unending pleasure.<br /><br />Zelenka's entire repertoire only extends to some one-hundred and fifty compositions and consists of a small number of instrumental selections, and a larger group of sacred vocal selections such as masses and requiems, psalms, magnificats, hymns and a few secular vocal works.<br /><br />Zelenka's music is always fresh and creative, often surprising in its sudden harmonic turns and demanding instrumentations.  Overall, his many compositions, both choral and instrumental, are marvelous examples of a subtle blend of Italian and French manners with a most distinctive personal style.  Fluency of declamation and wide phrases with elegantly shaped melodies in his choral works are clearly Italianate.  French influence is seen in the formal organization of the music into relatively short and contrasting sections.<br /><br />The 'Missa Dei Filii'ZWV20 recorded on this disc is a mass in honor of the Son of God.  As was usual in the first half of the 18th century, Zelenka's masses are so-called 'number works' in which the five parts of the ordinary of the mass (Kyrie,Gloria,Credo,Sanctus and Agnus Dei), are subidivided into smaller, musically independent single movements. Therefore, it is considered to be a 'short mass' because it contains only a 'Kyrie'(divided into three movements) and a 'Gloria'  (divided into seven movements).<br /><br />Zelenka left nine large scale settings of various litanae, the 'Litanae Lauretenae' subtitled 'Salus Infirmorum' (The healer of the infirm) was composed in 1744.  It has nine movements with varied ensemble groupings:Trio (S.A.T.), quartet (S.A.T.B.), three arias, one each for soprano, alto, tenor and four choruses, all of which are very well sung on this disc and lovely to hear!<br /><br />It's hard to believe that it took so long for Zelenka's music to surface, and I fervently hope that more recordings of it are on the way.  All the music herein as a whole demands excellent vocal technique and brilliant virtuosity from all the singers and instrumentalists involved.  Good example of this: 'Quoniam tu solus sanctus' as performed by Michael Chance, countertenor, in the 'Gloria'.<br /><br />The performance of this music is impressive because the excitement never ceases at any time during the performance.  Nancy Argenta, soprano, sings the best I have ever heard from her; Michael Chance, countertenor, is perfection with his flawless diction, wonderful flexibility and enchanting tone quality; Christopher Pregardien, tenor, has a warm and resonant sound and Gordon Jones, bass, sings with ease and 'lightness'.  The Kammerchor Stuttgart, under the talented direction of Frieder Bernius, is very fine as per usual with a buoyant and 'yummy' sound.  Tafelmusic: skillfully provides an excellent accompaniment; 'bravo' Jean Lamon.  I can't imagine anyone into Early Music who would not welcome this recording.
B0009X766Y|5.0|This is a former Best Picture winner - and six additional Academy Awards - that is pure entertainment.  It doesn't make any kind of political statements and it doesn't serve a social cause.  It's just pure, 100% entertainment - just how the movies should be.  Redford and Newman are stellar together in this one.  They come together as the seasoned con man (Newman) and the up-and-comer (Redford) to pull off a con against a dangerous mobster and ruffian.  This one has drama, comedy and some action.  Anyone who hasn't taken the time to watch \\"The Sting\\" needs to see it at least once.  If for no other reason, just for old time's sake and to watch a classic combining two of the great ones of Hollwood.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|Okay, so it's an \\"ok\\" CD with 5 good singles? This is not a strong comeback but a good one. I think they could have chosen a stronger single other than I Look to You for the first release but who am I, just another Whitney fan and music buyer, lol. I also like, Like I Never Left with Akon. The voice is a bit more raspy and thicker now (cigarettes do a job) but she's still got it. Clive Davis don't have too many \\"flops\\" now does he? It's a little \\"lukewarm\\" but the right video's and airplay will sell it right on into 2010. I'm glad Whitney's back!
630460291X|4.0|What can I say:  Costner is Costner no matter what movie he's in - all his characters act the same because he's one dimensional.  Morgan Freeman is always good, but I'm not too sure he was really meant to play a Moor with an accent.  Nevertheless, in revisiting this \\"oldie\\" (unless you're in your 30s or older, then this is just an \\"older\\" movie) I was really entertained.  And it was kind of fun to watch the guy that goes on to play Snape in the Harry Potter flicks as the evil Sheriff of Nottingham.  This one has good action, some drama and a sprinkle of romance.  It was longer than I remembered from years ago and could probably have been edited a little to shorten the length, but still a good movie to escape the real world for a few hours.

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I bought this flash after a fair amount of research.  I have a Coolpix 8400 and was looking for a better flash than the built in unit.  Prior to this model the 600 and 800 were the only compatible Nikon units.  The only real difference between those and this is that with the 400 all of the controls are done through the camera rather than the flash.  This feature allows the flash to be quite a bit smaller than the more expensive units because there is no screen on it.  Indoor photos have improved but outdoor, fill-in flash is outstanding.
B001GCUO4I|1.0|I don't review too many movies and those I do, I either love or hate. The last \\"movie\\" I saw that was this bad was \\"Ruins\\" (and I didn't think it was humanly possible to make anything worse than that). Well. . .I was wrong.    As I've seen most of the movies currently playing, my choices were very limited. So. . .after reading the blurb in front of the theater (which was the same mistake I made with Ruins), I decided to try Final Destination (and, sadly, they also didn't have a poster displayed - now I know why). There was so much blood and gore during the first five minutes, along with some of the most asinine and insipid dialog imaginable, that one has to question what type of morons would actually create such nonsense, as well as the intelligence of anyone who would pay money (let alone sit through the entire \\"movie\\") to see this. Normally, I don't give away the plot but Final Destination obviously doesn't have one. Of course, if you are so feeble-minded that you are entertained by human bodies being mutilated, in every possible conceivable (and non-conceivable) manner, have aspirations of becoming a serial killer, or have never had a brainwave in your life, this movie is certainly for you. Oh, I forgot to mention the \\"dialog\\" (if that's what it was supposed to be) - stupid teenybopper/college age (but certainly not college bound) kids boozing it up at a demolition derby certainly didn't require a script writer. The racist comments about a Black security guard by some of the lowlife trailer-trash characters, (\\"There goes the neighborhood\\") while another moron whistles Dixie was certainly insightful into the clear lack of intelligence of the movie's creators. Then, they added a little more \\"fun\\" - every trite and utterly insipid \\"special effect\\" was not only used to emphasize the dismemberment of countless cast members, but it seemed like there were at least twenty \\"actors\\" who were impaled with only God knows how many planks, stakes, or anything else that might be used, during the first few minutes.    After seeing enough blood and guts plastered across the silver screen (there was enough blood to fill both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans) that I literally walked out as the opening title was being displayed. I immediately had my ticket refunded and saw another movie instead.    Perhaps the most disturbing thing of all is that people not only spend money to produce fecal material such a \\"Final Destination\\" but that other people actually spend money to watch it. Of course, the movie was also shown in 3-D to assist \\"audiences\\" in enjoying the relentless splattering of body fluids - heck, it might be just about as much fun as going to a slaughter house or cutting off your own extremities with a dull knife.
B0000AGQ6P|5.0|I have watched this movie at least 20 times 18 years ago when my children were young. Now I am 53 years old. I recently, caught a short piece of the movie on cable one day at lunch. I realized this was only partially a children's movie. This continuation of the venerable Peter Pan story is all about the male mid-life experience (45-60 years old or so). When I watched it with this concept in mind, I found myself in tears within the first 15 minutes of the movie. It is such a profound mythic description of modern day man in mid-life. My children are now grown. Yet, I find myself just like Peter, drawn to return to the days of childhood to find what has been lost there and needing to pick up certain things for the next portion of life. All the characters of the self can be found in this story from the shadow to the male anima. Perhaps we all have to learn again how to fight, fly and crow. The challenges of mid-life are so wonderfully presented you could teach a course from this one movie alone. Yes, it is a great kid's movie, and 18 years ago my son had a Hook birthday party in which he begged me to put up a zip line for him to slide out of a window in our house. It has all the elements a young boy loves. But, there are all the elements that a 50 something man needs to hear again and work through. It's a classic for our time and perhaps for the ages.
B001VPJYZK|2.0|Don't you think that the characters are becoming catoonish? More then ever, we feel the screenplay behind their actions and words. They should have stop at season 4. The way it ended was perfect. Everything was brought to a conclusion and you jumped 5 years ahead for the last ten minutes just to have a sense of their future. Plus, you even had the cliffhanger of Susan and her mystery man. It just made you say that everything was going to be as always. It was the perfect way to leave. Like \\"Senfield\\" or \\"Cheers\\". Always leave them wanting more is the motto. Now, they want to keep on doing this for a couple more seasons... At some point, we'll just stop watching it, i guess. It's sad.    Am i the only one who thinks that the Lynette character is becoming more and more manipulative and mean? Why is Felicity Huffman accepting this? Doesn't she have the power now to ask for rewrites?     And what about the men? All soft and weak.     Yet, you find yourself being caught and watching it. Must be the writing and the charisma of the actors and actresses. But they need fresh blood as for the screenplay writers. Not because the old ones are bad. But because they are too much in that world. They need talented people who will turn it all upside down. Jumping five years ahead is not sufficient. At the end, it was the same thing all over again.     Just think that they want to keep on going with more seasons. You don't have a choice. New writers. New points of view. Don't wait for people to just stop watching it. Leave with a high.

B0019LY5IM|3.0|Forget about explanations. Millions of people all have their solutions. We'll see next year.  I can only say that part of the answer lies with the father figure. Almost all the charcters has had a problem with their father. Plus, you've got Hurley who talks about \\"The Empire Strikes Back\\" which is known to contain the famous Darth Vader Line \\"No Luke. I am your father\\". Plus, the creators has said that the end would be kind of biblical. And let's just say that in the Bible, The Father plays a big role. You also have Ben who describe the Passion Of Christ at some point... In that Passion, Jesus begs his father to save him and then reconciles with him. I'm telling you: something with the father figure is at the heart of this TV series.     Anyhow, this season gave me the best moment of the whole series. It's a small moment. A lot of people might not even remember. It lasts about 10 seconds and it's about Sawyer, one of the most interesting character, if not the most. At some point, he wakes up and leaves for he was informed that some of his friends were finnaly discovered. Juliete is troubled by it. As he arrives and gets out of his vehicle, what does he see? Hurley, Jack and... Kate getting out of the van. It's been years since he saw her. He even swore to Juliete that he didn't even remember her. And here she is. In front of him. The look on his face... and boum! the episode ends. That particular moment was so touching. Plus, we ourselves could identify with Sawyer cause those characters were absent for a complete episode or two prior to that. I was also glad, like Sawyer, to see them come out of the van. The look on Jack's face. The lines on his forehead. No words. Just emotions and a smile.     That moment surpasses the one, in season 3, where Sawyer, chained and forced to break stones, kisses Kate as he cannot control himself anymore. She is so sexy in her dress and covered with sweat. He just drops everything, walk up to her and kisses her and then, he attacks the others as they come to stop him.     Boy! That character really gives us strong moments... he's kind of the Han Solo of the Star Wars saga.    I still think that season 3 was the best. But season 5 is awesome. It really distances itself from the rest of the series as it embarks on a complete new journey of science-fiction. before, you could almost try (i'm saying \\"try\\") to explain everything in a scientific way. But in season 5... forget it. We are in complete fantasy. Now it's clear. Science cannot explain everything here. Some people might stop watching \\"Lost\\" from now on. The creators are now showing their cards. They don't care about new viewers. They are satisfying the old ones. The ones who are ready to follow now that it is officially a science-fiction series.
B000067CPX|2.0|Highlights from this album are ONLY \\"On Mercury,\\" \\"Can't Stop,\\" and \\"The Zephyr Song\\".  Most disappointing follow-up album EVER.  Only the \\"One Hot Minute\\" album is worse in the RHCP catalog.  Read Kiedis' autobiography- Flea almost left the band because this album sucked so INCREDIBLY bad.  If you want solid RHCP, check out Freaky Styley, Mother's Milk, Blood Sugar Sex Magic, Californication, or Stadium Arcadium.  Anyone who equates By The Way with ANY of these albums or somehow thinks it is pffffff (HA!) better than any of these albums is a complete Idiot and ought to be dragged out into the street and shot.
B00008PX8P|3.0|...but sadly modernized for those with MTV-ADD. What does that mean?    Well, Kevin Shirley is the one responsible for the way this DVD looks and feels. He's also responsible for much of Dream Theater and Iron Maiden's work as well, so one would think it would be top notch. But, as an older guy (I'm a child of the 70s), I can't stand the constant switching of cameras, blurred transitions, funky effects, etc. To me it seems like Shirley is attempting to create the feel of a modern music video from stock concert footage. Worst of all, there are video clips of some of the band members, mostly Plant, inserted into the songs which are not part of the original song, played out of order, or not even being played at that time. Several times during the Earls Court concert I noticed clips of Plant being injected into the film where in the audio he is clearly singing a note but the clip shows him gyrating in slow motion with the microphone waaaay off to the side, and not singing at all. There are also several clips of Jimmy Page during \\"In My Time of Dying\\" strumming a note and letting the sustain go, but the music is clearly still crunching along. And the most risible edit of them all - there's a clip inserted into \\"Immigrant Song\\" in which John Paul Jones is playing a different bass guitar from the one with which he started the song! On the good side, the audio on the second disk is superb. I really liked the way the band sped up the song \\"Trampled Under Foot,\\" one of my all-time favorites. The acoustic section is great - it's good to finally hear/see a live version of \\"That's The Way,\\" also one of my favorites. And \\"Going to California\\" is majestic.    The first disk doesn't really do it for me. I think Zeppelin was struggling for its sound on its first album, and this shows a bit in the live recordings. I won't belabor the Kevin Shirley factor, but needless to say there's more of it, though it's not as ubiquitous here as it is on disk 2. One thing that I could have done without was watching Jimmy Page strum his guitar with a violin bow for 10 minutes.    The extras are neat too - seeing some rare interviews is quite interesting, given how the band typically didn't open up often.    Bottom line: die-hard Zep fans should own this, the young kids will love it for its psychadellic editing, but if you're a casual Zep fan in your 30s or over, rent it first.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Loved this dvd.  My twin girls who are 14 months think it is great.  They get very relaxed and watch it intently.  I recieved this DVD of celtic women very promptly.  Thank you.  I would definetely order from Amazon again.  very much recommended
B0009TRRN0|2.0|This product took ages to come through the post, because it's an american product and i live in england. This was pretty annoying, but what was more annoying was that when it finally got here, it was NOT shogun assassin! It was \\"horror rises from the tomb\\" and \\"loreley's grasp\\": two spanish films, probably from the same era of which shogun assasin was made. a little help, anyone, on how i am to send this back as trade for what i actually ordered???
006091307X|3.0|Like many readers, I must confess that I have difficulty reading \\"stream of consciousness\\" style writing.  For some, this is what makes writers like Pynchon and Joyce hard to read.  The run-on sentences make the middle school grammar teacher in me scream out for order.  Despite this, I decided to give Pynchon's writing a chance.  While I did enjoy the overall story, the presentation was not to my preference.    In a series of conspiracies, Oedipa Mass finds herself executor of the estate of her late boyfriend.  Not only does she reveal the sources of his wealth, but she also discovers an underground network of conspiracies.  Scattered amid historical references, one door of conspiracy leads to another.  Dry humor and wit preceed the doors, yet I thought the attempts at humor did not always deliver a payoff.    I can appreciate the talent in Pynchon's writing, but I must admit that it is not my cup of tea.  It is apparent that his books have a rather devout following, yet his books are not for everyone.
B0026MS4BC|5.0|When you have experienced an Iron Maiden show, less words are necessary to explain your thougts. My case is actually this one and i must admit that the vynil edition is really something. I don't know if many fans still use this format, I do, for instance, and the reason is the quality and the feel of the stylus over the black plastic.<br />I believe this compilation rather than awesome is terrific and rather than loud is are-you-deaf. I loved it, really, and for one only song: Iron Maiden. Hopefully you can have the same opinion when you buy this, but it is really a must, for every fan, to belong this compilation. Live Maiden is really something, engineering is well done and no distorted dynamics like in the digital version, although i can't avoid thinking the taping was actually digital.<br />Hope you all get the disc and have / share same opinion! Up The Irons!
0061703257|5.0|No spoiler here. This book is a must read! It is so suspenseful, I couldn't put it down. Read it in two days and can't wait for the movie! Envisioned Leonardo Di Caprio the whole time-a great role for him!
B000OHG0B2|5.0|My son has had a few sets, and this is the only one that has stood the test of time. There are a few different ways to assemble the track--unless you lose one of the plastic pieces that holds sections of the track together. We've lost one of the two, and can only set the track up one way, but it still gets used! The part that shoots the cars around the track is compatible with most of the normal shaped hotwheels cars.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I might expose my skill as a literary film critic, but so be it.  I am NOT sir Robin, and I refuse to \\"run away\\".  This is an absolute classic, not to be missed.  There are so many classic lines in this movie.  I must say the \\"foul beast\\" with \\"teeth like this\\"  has to be my favorite part, as well as the bridge where you have to answer three questions to pass.  The black knight at the bridge, the french in the castle, and of course the swallows and the coconuts.  Genius.  So for those who want a laugh, get this movie.  I enjoyed it thouroughly as a boy, and my 16 year old, as with many, normally interested in computers/computer games and not my \\"old\\" movies\\" laughed and laughed.  He will be watching it many times.  For those who are critical of a little fun,  is all i have to say is      NI  Go bring me a shrubery, or a halibut.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Awesome! That's the best way to describe this product. It was easy to set up, produces amazing surround sound, and is truly comfortable to wear.
0689865384|5.0|This is the second book I've read by Scott Westerfeld now, and I can tell I will be thoroughly enjoying the rest of his books. The first book I read was Peeps, several months ago. The only reason it's taken me this long to pick up another one of his books is the ever-increasing stack of material on my bookshelves. For comparison's sake, I'm not the target audience of this novel; I'm 30 years old as of this writing.    I won't give a synopsis, as there are plenty to read already. Uglies was a dense read- that is, it felt like a richer book than the page count would indicate. The world felt fully-formed, and the writing served that world well. As a reader, one of the things that is hardest to define and yet the worst thing to experience is when the style of writing pulls me out of the story. That never happened to me throughout Uglies. The use of its unique slang felt natural, not clunky, and the main characters were well developed. Some of the secondary characters lacked slightly, but this was not a huge detriment to the experience.    I devoured this book in two days. I will be getting the second one in the next couple of days, because I can hardly wait to see what is in store for these characters next. It is a social commentary as much as it is a sci-fi novel, though those two do often seem to go hand in hand. It is rare that I give myself permission to reread a book, since there are so many others waiting to be read, but this will be one series I plan to revisit.     Some standardized book questions I'll be asking myself on each review:    Was it worth my time AND money?   Totally.     Will it be seeing a trip to the local used bookstore as a trade-in?  Nope!    Was there ever a point where I groaned because I just knew X-event had to happen?  Yes, but only once, really.    Was there anything truly incredible or surprising about this story?  Many things caught me off-guard as unexpected, particularly in the YA genre.    Did the characters ever act in a way that felt forced or inconsistent with the rules of the universe as the author has presented them? (Or, did the author in any way hijack the characters and sacrifice their realism for the sake of a plot point?)  No.    Since it is the first in a series, the most important question I can ask is: does it feel like a complete story?  I passionately hate books that try to bribe me into reading the second one by not having a complete story. What I mean by this is not that there are no loose ends, but that there is enough of a resolution for me to feel like I bought a complete book. Uglies is bewildering to my psyche because it has such a cliffhanger ending that it's really horrible to not have Pretties on hand, knowing that there is a continuation. However, I don't feel cheated out of a resolution, if that makes any sense at all. I like that it didn't tie everything up neatly, and I feel like the novel could stand solidly alone with my imagination filling in the rest of the events. So, the short answer is that it does feel complete enough.    Is it a guilty pleasure?  No, I'd highly recommend this book to anyone in the target age group and other adults alike. The story may not be to everyone's taste, but the writing is solid.    Two word summary:  Mesmerizing, futuristic
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Yes her voice is difference but the new voice is emotive, strong and richer.  Most of her songs are fantastic and Classic Whitney with an updated feel.  I can see a few hits and definitely some grammys!
031606792X|3.0|dont get me wrong, its a good book. but i was dissapointed that the saga ends here. the whole book was like an ending, with watery words leading up to the end. if you've read the other 3 books, then you HAVE to read the 4th to get the finale to make sense.
0385341008|3.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a book that highlights the best qualities of humanity. (I get so tired of reading about venal, self-absorbed neurotics who can't see past their own noses, don't you?) It was a welcome relief to read about people who were genuinely kind.<br /><br />The first part of this book was as absorbing for me as it was for Juliet, the central character. The inhabitants of Guernsey, with all their charm, their warmth and their quiet heroism drew me in to their lives as inexorably as a moth to flame. I read each letter eager to discover more of the history of the German Occupation of the Channel Islands, as well as the unfolding tragedy of Elizabeth and her child. These gentle, courteous exchanges of correspondence reminded me of a world lost (and of manners lost) in a way that a straightforward narrative could not have.<br /><br />Although I was intrigued and delighted with the first half of the book, the second showed signs of getting off track. Juliet's personal life wasn't nearly as interesting, or as convincing, as the story of the Occupation. And towards the end of the book, the plot became positively muddy with irrelevant characters (Remy, Billee Bee) and complications (the stolen packet of letters, the book on phrenology) which added nothing to the story and distracted us from the far more moving tales of the islanders. I was deeply disappointed with the Romance-novel happy ending, and in the style of its telling. The switch to Miss Marple-like notes not only changed the tone completely, they transformed a story that was touching in its utter simplicity into a rather weary cliche.<br /><br />In spite of the let-down at the end, this book is still well worth reading. We need more books, more writers, who are willing to delve into the heart of what is best about humanity--even within the historical context of what was worst.
B0019LY5I2|4.0|My husband and I saw this movie tonight on a whim, both of us remembering watching the cartoon from the 1980's. Now I wasn't expecting any fantastic acting or OMG fabulous writing, I went to be entertained and I was very entertained by this movie. I liked the Scarlett/Ripcord dynamic, something that has turned out to be somewhat controversial. This is due to the fact that in the cartoon Scarlett was always paired with Duke and with Snake Eyes in the comic. However, the two actors had chemistry, so I liked it.    There were two things however that I had issues with. The first being Cover Girl, she was my fave joe during my childhood and she was a TANKER not an admin/desk jockey. Also, you have no idea that it's her until the end credits roll around. It would have been nice to know that I had been looking at Cover Girl, instead of wondering if she was in the film. I heard that Lady J was in the movie as well, but I'll be damned if I could find her, if she was in it, like Cover Girl, they never come out and say it. They just assume that you are psychic and automaticlly know.    The second is Tatum Channing. Dear G-d, that man cannot act, at all, not even a little bit. Considering that he mostly plays off of Marlon Wayns and Sienna Miller, two people who can act... well it becomes painfully and pitifully obvious that he is out of his league. Which is REALLY sad to say, considering that this movie is pure escapist, action fluff! While he has the look of Duke for the most part, the man couldn't act his way out of a paper bag if someone held the end open for him.    Lastly, Breaker is a REAL treat. I found myself wanting more scenes with him and eagerly anticipating his lines. Hopefully he'll get more of them in the sequel, which is already in development and which all the actors are under contract to be in.
B002HR1W1K|5.0|movie is hilarious, im sure the bluray is spectacular. ANYWAY, apparently best buy managed to secure a deal where they get a head start on selling these. the bastards. now... do i wait till amazon has it? or do i pay markup plus tax to get it now?? HMMMMM......
0307454541|3.0|Bloated? Yes.<br /><br />Overblown? Yes.<br /><br />Entertainment value? Medium. The whole yarn is a bit of a slog.<br /><br />A \\"Reader's Digest\\" version might be the right length.<br /><br />I wish Larsson had a tougher editor, someone to trim the fat.<br /><br />There are many elements to like in \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo,\\" particularly the set up. The path to redemption for our fallen financial journalist is a beauty.<br /><br />But reading this book is like watching Luis Tiant (baseball fans will know) wind up. It takes forever. The ending is nearly as long. There is a self-described \\"labyrinth\\" of financial arrangements to track and a long list of characters to track.<br /><br />The plot pulls in a wide array of stray threads and readers are left to guess which thread will pull taut. Nazis? Check. Obscure biblical passages? Check. Tortured animals? Check Incest? Racism? Sexual deviants? Check, check, check.<br /><br />The main character, Mikael Blomqvist, is a bit of a wet noodle. He's the pinball being bounced around. The title character (who makes brings her energy to the plot after lots of time with Blomqvist) is a feisty and fun--but she's also a bit of a cartoon, endlessly fearless and equally a-social. She will always get revenge and in case we don't know that, she takes revenge on a bad apple early on.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\" is not for the squeamish, but the cartoon factor waters things down. It's no \\"Silence of the Lambs.\\"<br /><br />The work on the puzzle--and it's a beauty--takes time. But then the solution comes too easily. Photographs within photographs, an easy wiretap, a fast trip to Australia and then the long trudge to the finish.<br /><br />Kudos for a big, full, rich story. The vision was large, the sweep compelling. I finished. That's about all. Doubt I'll read the next.

B001VPJYZK|5.0|\\"Desperate Housewives\\", the popular ABC drama series (created by Marc Cherry, \\"The Golden Girls\\", \\"The Golden Palace\\", \\"Amas de casa despesperadas\\") which started back in 2004 definitely has gone through some major ups and downs with its dark comedy storylines to its complex marriage or relationship problems but if there is one thing definite about the series... its that the the fans love it and to keep the fans interested, the series went through a significant change for its fifth season.<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season - The Red Hot Edition\\" on DVD features 24 episodes (episodes 88-111).<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />Video is featured in Widescreen (1:78:1), enhanced for 16×9 televisions.  \\"Desperate Housewives\\" looks very good on DVD.  Outdoor scenes are nice and vibrant, blacks and low-light scenes do not have the excessive noise problems that some series tend to exhibit on a DVD release.  For the most part, cinematography for \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has been excellent and the editing top notch.  The series looks great and I can only imagine how beautiful this series would look on High Definition (via Blu-ray).<br /><br />Audio is featured in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound and pretty much, \\"Desperate Housewives\\" has always been a dialogue-driven television show and is primarily front and center channel driven.  For the most part, dialogue is clear and understandable.  The show uses minimal music and nor is it the kind of series that utilizes a lot of sound effects (the final episode has a little).  For the most part, the setting I preferred to watch the series was to set my receiver setting and have stereo on all channels.<br /><br />The series includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and in French.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season - The Red Hot Edition\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />DISC 1:<br /><br />  * ABC Starter Kit - If you hit play all on disc 1, you will get the ABC Starter Kit which briefly explains about what happened in the previous seasons of \\"Desperate Housewives\\".<br />  * Audio Commentary for \\"You're Gonna Love Tomorrow\\" - Audio commentary with commentary by Larry Shaw, Doug Savant, Kyle Maclachlan and James Denton.

There is only so much that these women could experience and with all said and done, it was time for major changes.  And thus, the new season of \\"Desperate Housewives\\" which takes place five years into the future and has literally grabbed the attention of the viewers.  Also, it helps with all the hype that built up around this time jump, the 100th episode and near the end of the series, the entertainment world went buzzing about a possible death of a major character.<br /><br />As a fan of the series, I really felt the series needed to get some type of jumpstart.  The tornado episodes of the fourth season was definitely significant but creator Marc Cherry and crew did a great job in setting the series up, five years into the future.  And also knowing that he had to gingerly disrupt the union of the housewives in Wisteria Lane by bringing in a major death.  But what I found quite enjoyable was to see Gabrielle in a position as a mother and to see this relationship between her and her child Juanita, definitely brings a different side of humor, than what we experienced with the other Housewives and their children.<br /><br />Also, to see how the other characters have gone through significant changes and how it has affected their families was quite entertaining and the introduction of David (Neal McDonough), definitely capture that darkness that we saw in the first season, that things on Wisteria Lane are not always right. But who can't love the continued drama of Susan's lovelife, the family challenges on Lynette and Tom, Bree's eventual success and how it is affecting her marriage and as mentioned, the hilarious family antics of Gabrielle's family.  Season five truly rocked!<br /><br />Saying anything more will spoil the series but I feel that those who were attracted to the dark but yet enjoyable and fun storyline of the first season, can find enjoyment with the fifth season.  I have to admit that watching the season finale definitely gave me the chills.  But in the end, I was really content and satisfied with the fifth season.<br /><br />As for \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season - The Red Hot Edition\\", the DVD set is a pretty solid release.  Many special features but I was surprised that there was no commentaries by any of the main housewives and I was hoping there would be a commentary by Nicolette Sheridan for \\"Look Into Their Eyes And You See What They Know\\".  But for the most part, you do get a good number of special features included in this DVD season box set.  I definitely hope ABC considers giving the series the High Definition treatment, for a DVD release, the picture quality on the DVD is quite clean and can only expect how beautiful this series would look on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"Desperate Housewives\\" fans, this DVD release is highly recommended!ma and Cake Fights - (20:49) The cast talks about celebrating a 100th episode.

But what I found quite enjoyable was to see Gabrielle in a position as a mother and to see this relationship between her and her child Juanita, definitely brings a different side of humor, than what we experienced with the other Housewives and their children.    Also, to see how the other characters have gone through significant changes and how it has affected their families was quite entertaining and the introduction of David (Neal McDonough), definitely capture that darkness that we saw in the first season, that things on Wisteria Lane are not always right. But who can't love the continued drama of Susan's lovelife, the family challenges on Lynette and Tom, Bree's eventual success and how it is affecting her marriage and as mentioned, the hilarious family antics of Gabrielle's family.  Season five truly rocked!    Saying anything more will spoil the series but I feel that those who were attracted to the dark but yet enjoyable and fun storyline of the first season, can find enjoyment with the fifth season.  I have to admit that watching the season finale definitely gave me the chills.  But in the end, I was really content and satisfied with the fifth season.    As for \\"Desperate Housewives: The Complete Fifth Season - The Red Hot Edition\\", the DVD set is a pretty solid release.  Many special features but I was surprised that there was no commentaries by any of the main housewives and I was hoping there would be a commentary by Nicolette Sheridan for \\"Look Into Their Eyes And You See What They Know\\".  But for the most part, you do get a good number of special features included in this DVD season box set.  I definitely hope ABC considers giving the series the High Definition treatment, for a DVD release, the picture quality on the DVD is quite clean and can only expect how beautiful this series would look on Blu-ray.    \\"Desperate Housewives\\" fans, this DVD release is highly recommended!

B001G50QCU|2.0|I was looking so forward to Smallville, it is the only show on TV my wife and I don't miss. When i found out the the old writers left at the end of season 7, I was a little worried. My worries came to be true. This was one of the greatest series ever made,it was horrible last year. The thing they used to do the best, have four or five stories going on inside the big story, were gone. They couldn't even do one story well. If it is a bad this year as last, I hope they end it, and not torture knowing how great season 1-7 were. I was always hoping to see Clark dawn the blues and reds at the last show, with these writers that will probably never happen! How can you get rid of Lex?!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001AQTWF2|3.0|I am not going to crucify this album as I have only given it one good listen.  I have had a few albums that I hated on first listen to grow into some of my favorites.  I don't know if this will be one of them but I do not think so.<br /><br />First of all, when reviewing performers with legendary albums it is customary to want to compare a new album to those of the past.  Doing this almost always makes one hate the new album, especially after a long absence.  When listening to such albums I try to pretend what if I was hearing this artist for the first time?  Would I enjoy this album?  Sometimes yes when it comes to the latest Stevie Wonder a few years back, Al Green's new series of albums, and most recently Maxwell, even Teena Marie's new stuff.  Unfortunately, when I listened to \\"I Look To You\\" the first thought was that I was listening to the album release of an American Idol's fourth runner-up.  The album is generic R&B pop and has no sense of a 40-something year old woman that has been to hell and back.  Yes, I know some of the lyrics addresses such but they are laid over music that would be fine for some backlot newcomer, but this is Whitney and she deserved better.<br /><br />I will continue to give this album a chance and if grows on me I will be more than happy to edit this review for the better.
0142000663|5.0|California, 1939: \\"The works of the roots of the vines, of the trees, must be destroyed to keep up the price . . . oranges dumped . . . The people come for miles to take the fruit, but this could not be. How would they buy oranges at twenty cents a dozen if they could drive out and pick them up? And men with hoses squirt kerosene on the oranges . . .\\"<br />\\"There is a failure here that topples all our success. The fertile earth, the straight tree rows, the sturdy trunks, and the ripe fruit. And children dying of pellagra must die because a profit cannot be taken from an orange. And coroners must fill in the certificates--died of malnutrition--because the food must rot, must be forced to rot.\\"<br /><br />This is a brilliant and penetrating engagement of America's and California's cultural history, that will remain an important work as long as humans are willing to examine what it is to be human.<br /><br />Seventy years later, it is too easy for comfortable Americans to believe that Steinbeck's earthy and troubled scenes of people struggling to live are now removed from our present concerns. Displaced migrants for whom dignity or health is beyond reach, desperate to find enough work to feed their familial children, aged, sick and dying, being beaten and shot and driven from impoverished tent camps--we are _not_ seventy years removed. Present realities are actually worse. Trickle-down economics' trickles stay closer to the wealthy than ever before. 2.7 billion people live on less than $2/day. 1.1 billion live on less than $1/day. These are 2001's numbers, and it's not gotten better. The economic causes are global, and the people spraying kerosene on the systemic waste of food (borrowing from Steinbeck's account above), are America's largest agricultural conglomerations subsidized by comfortably disinterested Americans. US farm subsidies, instituted during the depression years to support America's family farms, are now flowing into megacorporations, providing permission, power, and position to adjust food prices to their advantage. The lion's share of today's agricultural subsidies is really taxpayer funded `corporate welfare.' Don't expect your legislative representative to admit to this anytime soon, let alone try to grapple with it. And the reach is global. The would-be small family farmer in sub-Saharan Africa has no hope of competing with giant US food producers, brokers, and market fixers. Without any real hope for a domestic agricultural sector (excepting crops that can profitably be shipped to wealthier nations), these cultures have no light at the end of the tunnel. The tunnel has collapsed.<br /><br />No, expect instead that your representative is busy making sure you can buy more assault weapons, and more armor piercing ammunition too. Perhaps chumming with lobbyists for the afore mentioned market-fixers, or piously blustering about someone else's sexuality. Expect also for this representative to tell us what a benevolent people we noble Americans are. He may even interject some lovely sounding numbers in this regard. Question these numbers honestly. What percentage of a given program is for the salaries of American `consultants'? What percentage of our GNP is this generosity as compared to the percent GNP contributions of the other nations of the wealthy west? Are wealthy and/or complacent Americans the people `spraying kerosene' on the food that could feed the hungry? This is a very expansive issue, and perhaps I digress just a bit.<br /><br />Steinbeck was a wonderful writer, subversive in the eyes of the cultural status quo. We need another Steinbeck, of sorts. We could use many of them. This same basic storyline is painfully intimate in the lives of hundreds of millions today, but the scale is much larger and the distance and differentiation between the malnourished migrant and the wealthy lords of lands and foods has grown dramatically.<br /><br />\\"<br />Tom stepped clear of the ditch and wiped the sweat out of his eyes. \\"You hear what that paper said `bout agitators up north a Bakersfiel'?\\"<br />\\"Sure,\\" said Wilkie. \\"They do that all a time.\\"<br />\\"Well, I was there.

1932100660|5.0|With 35 [small type] pages of references, and more than 750 peer-reviewed article citations, this book is exceptionally sound scientifically. With over 300 articles published in professionally refereed science journals throughout a distinguished career, Cornell professor T. Colin Campbell is the real deal, so to speak (as opposed to pop health gods like Dr Atkins, who published no peer reviewed papers). If there are only half a dozen `heavy hitters' in the international nutritional biochemical research community, Dr Campbell is unquestionably one of them. Here is no `health guru' pitchman marketing some `amazing new diet' phenomena, no branded products, no branded programs, no paid endorsements, and no snake oil. If any book, any report or compilation of reports, on the statistical and causal relationships of human diet and human health, stands above the messy and self-contradicting tangle of `amazing new diets' published daily, it is The China Study.<br /><br />It's a curious thing to read the '1-star' reviews of The China Study that have been posted in this forum. One must notice the burning sincerity of Campbell's detractors, but in light of having read the book and checked references relevant to those complaints, one must wonder if these detractors actually read the book, and if they did so, were driven only to find something that could be attacked if separated from context and/or documented supporting evidence. In light of the book itself and the referenced studies, these earnest sounding complaints acquire an almost comical air.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the middle of the book `drags' somewhat, part II being quite dry and deliberate as compared to parts I, III, and IV. Not that the information contained in these 100 or so pages isn't important to the material, it is, but it would be a personal misfortune if a reader gave up on the book before experiencing the final eight chapters and the appendices.<br /><br />This reader scrutinized most of the book with pencil in hand, scribbling more marginalia than I likely have in any other text (which is saying something). There were hundreds of passages that I'd have liked to include in a review, but have decided to keep to this summarizing one:<br /><br />\\"How did we forget these lessons from the past? How did we go from knowing that the best athletes in the ancient Greek Olympics must consume a plant-based diet to fearing that vegetarians don't get enough protein? How did we get to a place where the healers of our society, our doctors, know little, if anything, about nutrition; where our medical institutions denigrate the subject; where using prescription drugs and going to hospitals is the third leading cause of death? How did we get to a place where advocating a plant-based diet can jeopardize a professional career, where scientists spend more time mastering nature than respecting it? How did we get to a place where the companies that profit from our sickness are the ones telling us how to be healthy; where the companies that profit from our food choices are the ones telling us what to eat; where the public's hard-earned money is being spent by the government to boost the drug industry's profits; and where there is more distrust than trust of our government's policies on foods, drugs and health? How did we get to a place where Americans are so confused about what is healthy that they no longer care?\\" (page 346)<br /><br />I especially enjoyed Dr Campbell's in-depth exposition of \\"the dark side of science.\\" He and several of his distinguished colleague's have experienced it intimately. I can't say that I found the discussion surprising. Over the years, most of my science reading has been rather different-- theoretical physics, including that research community's celebrated four-decade hunt for a `holy grail' theory of \\"everything\\" (!!), with a broadly preprogrammed insistence that it must be found in strings/branes approaches. Here one finds a similar problem. Science is not exempt from the myriad frailties and pressures (biases, egos, professional and/or economic conflicts of interest) that beset all human endeavors. In principle, the scientific endeavor is about identifying what questions to ask of nature, and how they should be asked. Unfortunately, given the influence of entrenched status quo interests, it is sometimes predetermined what questions will be allowed (funded), and what the answers are supposed to look like (which may be determined by the selection and framing of research questions, to the overt benefit of the funding source-- surprised?). An exposition of a relatable problem within the theoretical physics community is exposited by Peter Woit in his excellent book, Not Even Wrong. While the interests at play may be vastly different, the story apparently plays out the same. Non status quo research approaches are far less likely to find funding, and may finally constrain or terminate the careers of outstanding scientists. In terms of nutritional biochemical research, the results are often predictable \\"conclusions\\", and for the unaware lay consumer, relentless contradiction and confusion. I recently saw an MSN `report' stating that pork and chocolate bars have turned out to be health foods! That pretty much leaves lard and donuts. They'll be the next \\"surprisingly good for you\\" foods! The truth will one day prevail (we must hope), in the meantime, profit taking and the self-service of the status quo will press its day as far as it can. Money not only \\"talks,\\" it is a filibustering phenomenon!<br /><br />Get this book and read it; then gently place all of your \\"amazing new diet\\" and health regimen books, programs, and products where they belong (in the recycling bin or compost heap).

Now I can also use my wide angle lens for night pictures, as this flash does not cast a shadow like the built in flash does. What's more this flash is light and a perfect complement to the p5100.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|The tag line for this review references the title of the finale of Season 3, a jaw dropping, mind bending, shocker that pointed the series in a new direction and laid the groundwork for the endgame that would begin to unfold in Season 4.  Yes, it is an extremely pivotal episode for this groundbreaking show, yet it seems that it is the only thing that people remember from what was an otherwise excellent third season.  Critics and fans alike grew extremely frustrated with this installment of the series, only to jump back on board the Lost bandwagon at the season's end.  That's unfortunate since Season 3 is the most underrated of the show's run and quite possibly the best.<br /><br />The season opens where season 2 left off.  Jack, Kate and Sawyer are being held captive by the others while Syaid, Sun and Jin try to rescue them.  Much of the first half of the season focuses on this plotline and gives us a closer look at the inner circle of the others.  We learn more about Ben and his true motives.  We are also introduced to a new character, Juliet, a member of the others who may or may not be loyal to them.  Viewers are also introduced to Alex, the daughter Russo has been searching in vain for.<br /><br />The first half of the season focuses largely on Jack, Kate and Sawyer and their capture by the others.  I suspect that fans felt aggrivated by this since it took the focus off of the remainder of the survivors.  But it allowed the show to deepen its mysteries even further, to develop its three main characters more fully and to allow the audience to start to get an understanding of who the others are and what they are doing.<br /><br />The season's second half reunites the three with their island mates but continues to muddy the waters with the introduction of Richard, a member of the others whose role is unclear and who seems to never age.  We get some backstory regarding Ben's childhood where we finally see the Dharma Initiative in action as well as finding out what happened to them.  The mysterious Jacob, the never seen but revered leader of the others, is introduced into the plot as well.  Meanwhile, Desmond becomes a cast regular and gets an episode that shows what happened to him after the hatch exploded.  This episode not only deals with the ongoing theme of fate, but it also hints at the time travel element that will come to the forefront of the series down the road.  Elsewhere, Mr. Echo's time on the island comes to and end and Charlie learns what fate has in store for him.<br /><br />There's a lot to mull over in Season 3.  I haven't even mentioned the continuing identity struggle of Locke who eventually ends up joining the ranks of the others, or the sereis of events that brings Sawyer face to face with the man who was responsible for his parents' deaths.  Quite often, it can feel like the show is spinning its wheels; providing more questions than answers.  But be patient.  Season 3 is a dark, mystery filled journey that is extremely crucial to the show's story arc.  Even before arriving at the finale that changes everything, this season had already proven to anyone who had been paying attention, that Lost was about more than just survivors stranded on an island.  Something much bigger was happening to the surivors of Oceanic 815 and Season 3 is a major step towards figuring out exactly what that is.The mysterious Jacob, the never seen but revered leader of the others, is introduced into the plot as well.

Mostly they were there that innocent, and about that conscious. And a lot, one way or the other, had some satisfaction.\\"  WHAT?? Huh?? What did I just read?? Did that make ANY sense?? Amateurish prose masquerading as intellectualism. I mean, half the passages in this book could be submitted to that yearly contest they do where people send in the worst possible opening sentences of imaginary novels.

0767903811|5.0|I've been wanting to read \\"I'm a Stranger Here Myself\\" ever since I heard about it on the radio years ago. I must say that it was worth the wait, although some of the material is a bit dated now since it was published back in the 90s. Bill Bryson's stories are quite amusing. You can almost be guaranteed to laugh at least once (and sometimes more) per story. Each story is fairly short as they were originally for a weekly column in a British magazine. There are cute stories of befriending a skunk, stories of trips to the beach and a hilarious story about ice skating. Throughout the book Bill Bryson compares life in America to life in Britain. While reading my husband was watching \\"America's Got Talent\\" on the computer. Even though he had headphones on he could still hear me laughing. He kept saying: \\"What is SO funny?\\" For some reason this book just amused me and I've rarely laughed so many times while reading anything else. Since I myself lived overseas for many years I could relate to some of the culture shock you experience when you return to America after being gone for ten or twenty years. I will definitely try other books by this author.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review

Brooks has a remarkable way of telling a gruesome tale, and making his reader both laugh and cringe at the same time.<br /><br />What makes this book different from many other zombie books is that it includes many diverse interviews from the citizens undergoing this ordeal. The reader hears from people such as doctors attempting to heal the victims, a hitman trying to protect a wealthy mogul, and probably one of my favorites, the blind man who has survived against all odds. It is through these interviews that the reader is full immersed in the rise and fall of the outbreak. The realistic feeling of this book was totally unexpected.<br /><br />Overall, going into this book, I was expecting a satire which would probably border on cheesy. Thankfully, that is not I what I got. It is a wonderful fictional look at a zombie outbreak. And an enjoyable read for someone wanting a little zombie fun. A must read book for any zombie lover!
B001AQTWF2|3.0|After streaming the album 3 or 4 times from her website and being exposed to the 4 tracks that were released before street date, the good news is that it is a better album than her last studio outing, \\"Just Whitney\\". The album kicks off with the 4th leaked track that has now been deemed the \\"first official single\\", the Motown-infused, \\"Million Dollar Bill\\". Produced by Swizz Beatz and composed by Alicia Keys, it is a fun, summer song that is one of the lighter songs in this new album. Much has written and speculated about the strength of her voice. I side with those who feel it is unfair to compare it to the voice we were first introduced to in 1985.     The voice is more well worn and clearly not the instrument it once was. What is more perplexing is the song quality. That was the case with \\"Just Whitney\\". If Clive Davis commanded the best and brightest to craft songs for this album, one is left wondering like the old Peggy Lee song states, \\"Is That All There Is?\\". The centerpiece of the album is the 2 ballads, \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" written by Diane Warren and produced by David Foster AND the title track, written and produced by R. Kelly. Those songs harken the listener back to her best work if only because of the craftsman commissioned to create them specifically for Whitney. Both songs are also close to being biographical (along with the other R. Kelly track, \\"Salute\\" and \\"Nothin' But Love\\". The other aforementioned tracks offer fans some insight into what Ms. Houston has been up to since we last heard from her. \\"Salute\\" and \\"Nothin' But Love\\" speak in part to her welcome separation and eventual divorce from one, Bobby Brown. The title track and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" transport the listener to the emotional journey she has been on since that time. \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" came heralding Whitney at the top of her game, a song so emotion-packed that it is worthy of a Diva's celebrated performance. That much hype can be a turn off, and it was upon first hearing it as it leaked to radio a few weeks ago. Upon first listening, it did not deliver. It is already struggling at AC radio, but, experiencing a degree of success at Urban AC radio stations ( a format that would be most open to her after her hiatus). With repeated listenings, it finally has grown on me. Still, those two ballads are heavy and by no means qualify as easy listening, in the best since of that concept.    The rest of the album tries to lighten up the affair. Clive Davis has never been known for making music with creditability, as much as, he is known for making music that appeals to the mainstream public. With that in mind, the first track that surfaced months ago, \\"Like I Never Left\\" featuring Akon should be the most radio friendly. But apparently, its initial attempt to entice radio programmers were not as successful. It may be possible to comeback to that song as a single as it does go down easy. The other tracks are okay, just not very memorable. It is those tracks that makes one wonder if this was \\"Worth It\\" to be held back for so long. On paper, the ballad-to-club arrangement of the Leon Russell classic, \\"A Song for You\\" seems designed to reach the audience that found the joy in \\"I'm Every Woman\\". It misses the mark for me, but, it is possible with more mixes, the minor club masterpiece it seeks, will finally become reality.    As to be expected, this album is already being touted for a Grammy sweep. In fact, part of the hype, surrounded moving the album up \\"due to incredible demand\\". At closer inspection, moving it up a day, simply insures that it will be eligible to sweep the Grammy nods  (that it is destined to get....if only in part, for the empathetic voting body at NARAS that will make Houston a perennial Grammy nominee-winner, like Aretha (no matter how slight the output from either Diva).....they are in that zone and will probably walk away with 6-7 more Grammys.    For me, this album is okay. It falls short of its hype.But it will be #1, it will probably have a lot of hit singles and once again, walk away with a lot of awards. Again, it is marginally better than \\"Just Whitney\\" but does not rank with the year's  best in my opinion......and has quite a distance to go before it satisfies to the level of the \\"Bodyguard\\" songs and the much more listenable, \\"My Love is Your Love\\". But welcome back Whitney......your fans are plentiful. I wont be looking to this album for ultimate listening pleasure in a year where Chris Cornell has challenged his rock base w/ \\"Scream\\", Maxwell and Teena Marie have returned triumphantly and the pending releases of Barbra Streisand, Diana Ross and Sade promises to make it a much more memorable year in music!
B002BFBAWO|3.0|Reading the many laudatory reviews of how this is a great \\"Coming of age\\" story, I'm struck by how different today's college grads must be...Innocent young naif who has obviously never been kissed and is crushed because as a college grad Mommsy and daddsy can no longer spring for a graduation jaunt through Europe and high-priced grad school.  If this were the story of a sheltered pampered high school Valley Guy as in \\"Clueless,\\" I could maybe buy the premise, but this is no teenager--he's a supposedly grown man (albeit with a worthless liberal arts degree) who should be pulling up his socks and getting on with his life.  Granted, Kristen Stewart's plight is poignant, her stepMom is a horror, and she's still in school, but even \\"Felicity\\" went out and got a job as a barista rather than knuckle under to her Dad. This whole story struck me as a self-indulgent immature refusal to come to terms with adulthood and independence--or is that maybe the point of the whole movie. If so, that doesn't seem to be the message other folks are getting.
B00009AOBI|5.0|What mainly makes Mask such a classic is the fact that the actor who plays the teenager in the film with the unusual Mask disease opened millions of peoples eyes on this very rare and devastating disease that's unfortunately very real.  Back in the mid 80's the disease only affected about 22 million people in the world, but who knows if that number has increased or decreased today.    This story will touch you on many unexplainable levels because you begin to feel compassion for people who have to suffer with the disease while getting to know Eric Stoltz's character develop, and you will even begin to see that people who have to deal with the disease can be just like you and me, if you're willing to get over how they look and just accept them as normal people.    In the case of Eric Stoltz's character with the Mask disease (based on a true story of someone who really had the disease and died in 1978) you will see how intelligent he was, how easy it was for people to fall in love with him because of his likeable personality, and you will even see how brave he is, and how he doesn't get annoyed or take it personally when someone makes fun of how he looks.  When you consider all these things, you begin to realize how most everyday people aren't able to measure up because most normal people (including me) sometimes tend to take unimportant things seriously that mean absolutely nothing in the grand scheme of things.  The person who suffered with the Mask disease was all about having fun, living life, and not letting a horrible disease get in the way of his dreams.    So Mask is a terrific movie with an award-winning performance by Cher and Eric Stoltz.  It doesn't even matter if you don't care for Cher's music- it's her performance that really strikes you hard and makes you a fan of her acting abiliities.  A fantastic movis this one is.

B0017VG69U|5.0|Although I was born in the early 80's, I prefer TOS (The Original Series) over TNG (The Next Generation). I have watched the show time and time again, seen every incarnation, and have never seen anything like the remastering they've done here. I own this box set mainly because I took the HD-DVD plunge and bought the first season (Yellow Case) for HD-DVD/DVD combo.  It retailed then for over $200. So then before the newest JJ Abrams flick began to emerge, I bought this set to further my collection.  Little did I know that Paramount, after severing ties with failing HD-DVD manufacturer, TOSHIBA, was going through some changes with Star Trek and Licensing.  With the success of the newest incarnation of the TREK franchise, Paramount has gone crazy releasing Blu-Ray versions of TOS Era Movies, (I-VI) TNG Era movies (VII-X), and TOS Television series. These are all a must buy for me! So, on to the review...<br /><br />The shows are unaltered in their plots and basically any scene involving 60's SFX was altered or replaced with new CGI. Now... Don't get freaked out on me hard core Trekkies, because the CGI is done with TOS Era in mind.  There are multicolored stars in the starfield, and the ships have not been overdone with hull-plating and bulkhead details.  The ships are still smooth gray Navy looking ships with the nice black lettering.  What they have done is take these models and replace the planets (Blobs of colors in spherical shape) and replaced them with 3d models that resemble something like a High Res google earth model.  There are very photographic weather patterns and mountain ranges which can be seen even better in Season 1 HD-DVD.  The ships move more naturally and have a more TNG feel to their maneuvering.  Romulan Birds of Prey still have red wings painted on the hull and are very authentic.  There is absolutely no remnant of Star Trek: Enterprise (Scott Bakula, Jolene Blalock) CGI in these DVDs. It is very Original Trek complete with Uhura's short skirt and Sulu's perfectly parted hair.<br /><br />The film itself has been cleaned up, brightened, and restored to a quality that most new sitcoms can't achieve even with new equipment.  This is the Trek that will keep new and old fans interested in a legacy franchise.<br /><br />NOTE: I own this set, but if you have a Blu-Ray / HD Television set up, put down your cash and buy Season 2 on Blu-Ray! I will double dip as well just to have both versions (DVD/BD) to enjoy on any TV in the house.  The blu-ray is packed with most of the DVD set features, but also lets you view Original vs. Restored in the same Frame! I would love to see that myself so I will be buying Season 1 (yep even though it's on HD-DVD in my shelf) and season 2 on Blu-Ray!<br /><br />Being an A/V phile, I have a 1080p BenQ Projector and a 10' (Yes, 10 feet) Diagonal Electric Rolldown Screen with a Pioneer 7.2 DD/DTS DD True-HD/DTS-HD receiver and JBL Speakers/Subs to match.

Personal I do not like X sex in movies, but it really showd how people used to live und the Story ist fantastic, you really see how the Military and the soldier plus the rich and poor, how they suffered and triumpfed.    I would recommend for Adults not for Teenagers or children even the History and the Stories are excellent.
0634049011|4.0|While Guitar Fretboard Workbook is definitely a useful book for anyone still learning their way around the guitar neck, I would recommend instead Barrett Tagliarino's newer book: Chord-Tone Soloing. Not only does Chord-Tone Soloing cover what appears in Guitar Fretboard Workbook, there's additional material (arpeggios, tone targeting, diatonic harmony, etc.). Seems to me that Chord-Tone Soloing is basically an expanded edition of Guitar Fretboard Workbook, except with less pencil and paper work (urgh) and more guitar playing (yes!).

B001AQTWF2|1.0|save your money, I give this a few weeks and you will be able to get it for a few bucks. This release for a 7 year wait it a big disappointment. The big whitney fans are gonna love anything she puts out as you can read by the reviews here but, lest not pretend this is any great cd. It sound old, and dated, way too many slow songs with no feeling. Million dollar bill is the best if you can give it that, but I really dont see to many number 1 hits here, as you can see the first two singles on here both tanked, million dollar bill will be her 3 single and the cd just can out. you do the math. I also dont see any big grammy wins here, that is why theyrelease this by the end of the month. If they do give her a grammy nod, it will be because they feel sorry for her. Better luck next cd. Yes, houston, there is still a problem here. s.o.s, send help.

0385737947|4.0|Kudos to Dashner for writing a fast-paced and riveting young adult novel, one that kept me questioning right along with the characters and still guessing at the end. The Maze Runner is an easy and engaging read and I highly recommend it for teens and adults alike - 4 stars.<br /><br />That being said, I am extremely frustrated by the abrupt ending both to the adventure and to the book itself. I understand there's a trilogy, but I want each book to function as well as a stand-alone read, either with some resolution or with an actual ending. I was so caught up in the boys' struggle, so ready for them to solve the Maze, or at least escape it, and then suddenly we're at an epilogue, written from a different narrative point-of-view, and I'm left only with clear foreshadowing of events to come in later books. But what about this book?<br /><br />I found Dashner's writing to be clear and age appropriate, and his character development was very good, especially considering that none of the kids actually have any memories of themselves before the Glade - he still created distinct and realistic personality traits and flaws. But I was disappointed at the end of my reading - I will certainly look for the next book in the series, but I wish I felt like I had truly finished this one!
1891252089|4.0|This practical and didactic book lives up to its title with photos and descriptions of every pose presented in the traditional Ashtanga order of practice.  Although the images on the front might suggest that this book is only for those at an advanced level yoga practice, the modifications of key poses and the abbreviated sequences included make this book accessible for anyone, from beginner to aspiring Yogi, who wants to practice Ashtanga yoga.  The spiral binding that allows the book to lay flat during one's practice is especially nice, as are the suggested 30 and 45 min practices for those of us who are a bit crunched for time.

B0028MBKVG|5.0|I don't run.    That doesn't matter. I loved this book. It makes me want to run. Barefoot. It makes marathons seem like walks in the park. Some people complained that this book is like a long magazine article. Well, I like some magazine articles. In fact, I like a lot of articles from The Atlantic, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, etc. So, I am not sure why that is a bad thing.    This book opens up a world, a people, that I didn't know existed. Why didn't I? Why doesn't everybody? And, why does everyone I see running past my house every day have such big frowns on their faces? And, why don't we all eat salads for breakfast? Why do we wear shoes and why does Nike exist? And, where can I buy pinole? Well, I learned answers to many of those questions, including, \\"What is keeping me from running?\\" (Answer: laziness.)    The book, story, characters, information and race are fascinating. It only bogged down slightly over the course of the few pages dedicated to evolution. That aside, the book has a very nice flow to it, going back and forth between the main story, mini-stories and informational asides.    I liked \\"Born to Run\\" so much, I may run in the morning.

B002I9Z89Y|5.0|I am writing for two reasons. One, to state that Season 2 is a close second behind Season 1 in overall quality. Season 2 has some classics like \\"Amok Time\\", with the debut of the \\"Lonely Bass Line\\" musical theme, \\"Wolf in the Fold\\"( Scotty's favorite), \\"Mirror Mirror\\", \\"I Mudd\\",\\" ...Tribbles\\", \\"Bread and Circuses\\"(our current state of civilization), A Piece of the Action, and Patterns of Force. But it did contain a few stinkers, notably the unwatchable Catspaw and the annoying Friday's Child. Overall, the quality is quite good.<br /><br />Secondly, I  write in defense of William Shatner's staccato acting. If you really watch all the episodes closely you'll notice most of the time Kirk is fairly even with his emotions and acting. It's when he's going off on a rant about, \\"without creativity the body dies\\", or having to out-reason a computer(M-5, Return of the Archons, The Changeling) or speech in front of  huge brains encased in glass. Often he rise to the occasion with an impassioned plea during a trail scene. Usually we he is just talking with Spock or Bones, it's very thoughtful, measured, and relaxed. It's during the times when he has to convince someone or something that his acting becomes hyperbolic.. But, this makes sense from the character's perspective as he needs to act this way in order to persuade other characters that his way is the right way..<br /><br />The other way Shatner's acting seems seems \\"over the top\\" are episodes involving \\"change of character\\". For example, in \\"The Enemy (\\"I wanna live\\")  Within\\", he had to play the ID character in an over the top manner. Similar episodes where he had to \\"be\\" someone else include Season 1's \\"The Naked Time\\" , where he grabs his infected hands and utters, \\"Now I know why the call it SHE!\\", and \\"Shore Leave\\", where he's interacting with a childhood rival. In Season 2, there's \\"Mirror Mirror\\" (evil Kirk), \\"The Deadly Years\\"( aging Kirk), \\"I Mudd\\"( fun loving Kirk), and \\"Return to Yesterday\\"( where Sargon inhabits his body). Season 3 had \\"The Paradise Syndrome\\"( where Kirk becomes an Indian,\\"I am Kirok\\"), \\"The Enterprise Incident\\"( Kirk as Romulan) and \\"Turnabout Intruder\\"( perhaps the \\"most overacted\\" Kirk, but he's actually playing a woman).<br /><br />In all these instances of grand speeches, or when Kirk became someone else, or was impersonating someone else, Shatner was doing what was required of that character at that moment. It wouldn't make sense to play it any other way. I also submit to you when people look back on their \\"remembered\\" Star Trek episodes, it will most likely be these occasions that \\"stand out\\". When they reflect, they'll think, \\"boy that Shatner sure did overact\\". But upon further reflection they should reason, \\"You know what, it wasn't overacting, but necessary to the character.\\" Keep in mind Shatner was a Shakespeare trained actor, like Olivier. Are we to accuse all Shakespearean actors of over acting?<br /><br />I should also point out that much of the Shatner overacting accusations derive from his roles post-Trek, especially TJ Hooker, which is difficult viewing. And his role on Boston Legal, where he's seems to play an over the top buffoon. But his performances are amazing as Denny Crane. These and his appearances on SNL  and the TV adds enhance this caricature.<br /><br />Finally I'd like to debunk the \\"Myth\\" that Shatner got some \\"action\\" in every Star Trek episode. He is definitely  flirtatious and charming with the fairer sex. But on only two confirmed occasions did he actually \\"close the deal\\". That's barely 3% of the time. What's all the fuss?? The following is a run down of all alleged \\"transgressions\\". I've categorized them into 4 areas.<br />Flirting or Is Feeling Randy<br />Mudd's Women<br />The Enemy Within<br />The Naked Time<br />Catspaw<br />A Private Little War<br />Plato's Stepchildren( A forced interracial kiss)<br />Elaan of Troyius<br /><br />Maybe<br />The Conscience of the King<br />The City on the Edge of Forever<br />TheGamesters of Triskelion<br />*Lt.

Even if it's been parodied and portrayed in more ways that you can shake a walking stick at, this collection still offers new readers the chance to discover a lifelong companion.<br /><br />True, the font size is not huge (they need to fit over a thousand pages into this book, after all!), but it's certainly very legible. In return you get a book that you can take anywhere, in an admittedly large pocket. There's actually a combined book (Volumes I & II) but it's more than two pounds (weight not price!).

B00013RC8O|4.0|Sure, the whole movie is a car chase. But it's really about something else: our existence. Why are we here? *Are* we here at all? Yes, this movie has some bizarre scenes (like the snake catcher in the desert) and while there are some drugs, they are not the focus, and certainly less impactful than the original advertising for the film would have had you believe (\\"Thrills, spills and a handful of pills!\\").<br /><br />Kowalski is an \\"Everyman\\" much like Dennis Weaver's David Mann in Duel. Great car sounds and a startlingly good performance by Cleavon Little in one of his first films, and certainly his first leading role in a movie. (He died much too young at 53.) This film surely won't float everyone's boat, and even for people who like it, there are unanswered questions and things that could have been done differently.<br /><br />It was fun to hear the director (Richard C. Sarafian) wax poetic on the commentary. He sounded a little bitter at not being the next Steven Spielberg, but who knows, maybe if things had turned out differently, he could have done Jaws instead!<br /><br />The DVD includes both the US and the UK theatrical versions. The latter has extra footage. Only problem with having both is they are on opposite sides of a DVD (i.e., single layer). That means of course it's more likely to get scratched, and indeed my first copy was. From what I've read, the 1997 remake was utter garbage.
B000YGFGD6|4.0|The reason I bought this dvd is to watch a movie produced by Michael Jackson who loves making movies. I could say this movie is MJ's creativity putting together nicely the storyline along his greatest videos including \\"man in the mirror\\", \\"retrospective\\", \\"leave me alone\\", \\"come together\\" (uuuhhh I love it.. I love it.. wondering how many times he changed his ripped T-shirt, he must have kept his wardrobe staff busy), \\"the moon is walking\\", \\"smooth criminal\\" (I love when the antagonist character says 'it isn't smooth criminal, isn't it?').. with clips from his early days in the Jackson 5, live concert and Grammy performances. Also, I enjoyed the cameo appearances by Joe Pesci, Mick Jagger, Sean Lennon and Elizabeth Taylor. Funny 'MJ' scenes make me smiling and laughing.      His imaginative idea is creative, genius and original. It's interesting that MJ transformed his strong image as 'moonwalk' dancer into ... another imaginative character: a 'moonwalker' allien; shocking me after he frightened his enemies only by changing his appearance hiding into his 'rabbit' costume haha... The Moonwalker is actually a heroic-powerful character who got the power when he or his three best kid mates fly away their imagination into the outer space finding Moonwalker MJ's lucky star/meteor. Of course he only uses his power when he's in danger. He created the adventure storyline searching for Skipper (Katie's dog) and finally.. kidnapped Katie. Unfortunately after he completed his mission.. he left for the moon. I'm touching by this 'farewell' scene that is related to this mourning-year of Michael Jackson's passing.. Katie and her 2 kid mates say 'Good bye Michael..' 'I'm going to miss him' 'I wish he would come back'. She is holding Michael's lucky star made by Michael (her kid mate who shares the name with MJ), and.. does he come back?
B0026S1XDM|5.0|If there could be something in rock music that can compare to a symphony, this is it. Mike Oldfield's original masterpiece gets a facelift here that adds a new dimension to an old favorite.     Make no mistake; this is not a re-recording of the original, as the \\"Tubular Bells 2003\\" was. This is the original, remixed by Mike himself at his Bahamas home. Mike made it no secret that he was never totally satisfied with the sound of the original mix. It was a rush job, as he had only two weeks to record and mix it for presentation to the record company. He's had a chance now to make the mix work to his liking, and the sound- both in stereo and surround- is nothing short of amazing.     I must clarify one thing here; I'm a big advocate of music recorded for, and in, surround sound. When music recordings are made, they are generally multitracked. As many as 24 or more individual tracks are used. Trying to take all that information and make it fit into the two channels of a stereo CD is a daunting task. There will be a lot of music that was recorded that simply won't fit without making things sound too cluttered. Multichannel, mainly 5.1, opens up at least three more channels to make better use of more of what was recorded. And if the recording engineer is worth his salt, he can create a surround mix that makes sense. Sure, it may not be completely realistic, but it delivers more of what was intended for you to hear.    On this set, Mike rebalanced the sound and opened it up to reveal, as mentioned above, more of what was recorded...even on the stereo mix. As good as the original is, this was an eye-opener. (Or is that ear-opener?)     The surround mix was a revelation. Elsewhere on the site, I have a review of the SACD of the original. I remember having the quadraphonic LP of the original, on a CD-4 record. What was on the SACD in surround was NOT the original mix. Nor is this, but it wasn't passed off as such. The textures in the music are revealed even more in the surround version, without resorting to loads of sonic trickery. There's no excessive \\"moving the music around you\\" effect, although where it is used, it's used to good effect.     This is a recording that needs to be in your collection if you're a rock fan, and especially if you want to find out just how much better music can sound in surround. Your DVD player can be the greatest music machine ever. Let's hope Mercury, and UMG, also give Mike's   \\"Ommadawn\\" and other similar albums, the same treatment.
B001AQTWF2|3.0|Still a force to be reckoned with at 46, pop diva Whitney Houston has made a 2009 comeback album which proves to be a natural successor to her best work as a recording artist, 1998's [[ASIN:B00000DFRS My Love Is Your Love]]. Had this album come out right afterward, my guess is that it would have been received with the right-level acclaim. The reality, however, is that eleven years have elapsed since then, and Houston's wildly swerving life and career have been constant tabloid fodder and obscured her enormous talents as a singer. There has been such a deliberate intent by executive producer Clive Davis to fan the flames of anticipation for this disc that the result is bound to disappoint at some level. Moreover, no matter how cautiously polished the production, there is no doubt that her voice has coarsened whether through the cumulative effects of her own personal turmoil or the inevitability of age. At the same time, her unfettered desire to be relevant and come out triumphant is admirable and comes through frequently enough on a variable selection of songs that range from [[ASIN:B000002VCQ traditional Whitney fare]] to streetwise hip-hop.<br /><br />Dance tracks abound, although unfortunately, there is a stumble out the gate with the Alicia Keys co-penned \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", a tepid piece of dance pop. The opener is only partially offset by the grit of Houston's urban-hued throatiness on the Fernando Garibay-produced \\"Nothin' But Love\\", which percolates persistently on a Euro-club groove. There is also a continental tinge to the Akon-produced \\"I Got You\\", heavy on echo effects and synth riffs that compete with the multi-layered back-up vocals. Norwegian flavor-of-the month songwriters and producers StarGate give \\"Call You Tonight\\" a catchy new-jill beat with an odd country twang that Houston manages with confidence, while \\"Worth It\\" is similarly buoyant albeit rather interminable. For better or worse, \\"For the Lovers\\" sounds like a Michael Jackson outtake with its Quincy Jones-style percussion-synths combo and breathy choruses that evoke the Gloved One in his acne-laden youth.<br /><br />It's not too surprising that Houston comes back to the power ballads that her fans demand. The title track is an appropriately bombastic R. Kelly-penned number that plays on the singer's excesses as well as her talents, an approach compounded by lyrical clich&eacute;s and syrupy production. At times on this track, her raspy tone makes her sound strangely like Simply Red's Mick Hucknall. Houston's mid-tempo duet with Akon, \\"Like I Never Left\\", sounds like it's about a lovers' reconciliation, but one can't help thinking she's really talking about overcoming the disappointment of her fans. Tinkling piano opening aside, her cover of Leon Russell's \\"A Song for You\\" seems custom-made for her histrionic approach, but it denigrates into synth-filled disco funk instead of distilling into the plaintive confessional that Bette Midler and Karen Carpenter provided nearly four decades ago. Usually a sharp interpreter, Houston somehow misses the point of the lyric here.<br /><br />The best tracks on the disc reflect the two extremes of her work and share a deeper sense of revelation about her recent personal problems. R. Kelly's \\"Salute\\" has a punchy vibe complemented by the singer's scornful though melodic delivery of lyrics that really say more about her than anything else on the album. However, the high point really comes with Diane Warren's \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\", a resounding echo of early Whitney given David Foster's swelling, gossamer-gloss production. Somehow, the approach still works after all these years as her obvious turmoil comes across in a triumphant declaration. The net result is a Whitney Houston who may lack the bell-like clarity of her youth but instead offers a lived-in perspective that comes from someone intent on beating the odds. Had the material here consistently measured up to her innate sense of personal survival, this recording could have been something more significant than it is.mething more significant than it is.
B00003CX9E|3.0|It can be difficult to watch a \\"classic\\" film like this because of all the baggage that comes along with it. It's a challenge to stay unbiased. Almost like when a trial has to be moved because all the potential jurors have already been influenced. Citizen Kane certainly falls in this camp. After all, it is perennially ranked #1 (AFI, Sight & Sound, etc.) and thus there is an *expectation* that it will be one of the best.<br /><br />It might well be other people's favorite film, but I cannot say the same. It was very good, and I will surely watch it again (I've already watched it twice on this nice new DVD). But I can think of several movies I like better, including Casablanca which came out a year later.<br /><br />Funny enough, I see more of a parallel between Charles Foster Kane and Orson Welles (later in life) than I do between Kane and William Randolph Hearst. In the end I think the film is a technical masterpiece and kudos to Welles, who of course also directed and produced. But in my opinion, he was better in Touch of Evil (1958).<br /><br />I think honestly this is a three-and-a-half star movie and I should probably round up because of all the great extras on this release.
0307588335|3.0|In a nutshell, this book attempts to address the recent (and ongoing) housing crisis.  For many reasons, including high commissions, relaxed regulation, several government housing policies, and the intense desire to compete with others, financial institutions in the United States began to provide mortgages to individuals who would never be able to repay them.  Through overall lax lending standards, banks wrote an incredible amount of subprime loans.  They weren't worried that some mortgages wouldn't be repaid, as they passed off the risk to others through various securitized investment products, such as CDOs.  Loans would simply be repackaged as bonds and sold off to investors.  Due to crafty structuring with the help of ratings agencies, these CDOs seemed risk-free - yet provided a much better return that US Treasury securities.  Investors loaded up on these products, and every major financial firm jumped in the game of underwriting them.  As mortgage defaults started coming in, inventories of CDOs began to pile up, and it became harder to move risk off firms' balance sheets, until nobody wanted to buy them.  Many banks got stuck with huge levels of these toxic assets on their books - Lehman Brothers being one of them.<br /><br />I have very mixed feelings about this book.  At first, I really liked it.  As I kept reading, I wanted to continue liking it, but several aspects got increasingly annoying, and more and more crucial details seemed to be missing.  The book is subtitled The Inside Story of the Collapse of Lehman Brothers.  I feel this is somewhat misleading.  This book is the life story of Larry McDonald, who only spend 4 years of his career at Lehman Brothers, as a vice president in distressed fixed income trading.  It takes 80 pages for Larry to get to Lehman Brothers.  First, he spends several chapters describing his background and his career path into finance.  While this is moderately entertaining, I picked up the book to read about Lehman, not Larry's adventures in pork chop selling.  After he finally gets to his employment at Lehman, Larry spends many pages describing his buddies, his work, and his various trading success stories, when he made X amount of money off Y trade, etc.  As many other reviews have mentioned, you start to notice Larry glorifying his accomplishments very frequently... until he starts patting himself on the back every couple of pages.  To be frank, that became incredibly annoying very quickly.  Furthermore, a lot of Larry's writing seems to be an anthem to his close friends and coworkers at Lehman. I am sure they are wonderful people, but we don't need to be reminded how beautiful, amazing, or brilliant each one of them is.. every few pages.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book is that it doesn't provide a detailed picture of Lehman's last few months.  I was hoping to see something like House of Cards, which describes Bear Stearns' collapse in incredible detail.  This book, however, does not even come close.  Larry is unfortunately laid off from Lehman before any of the major final events, so he doesn't really have an insider's perspective of what happened.  Furthermore, Larry was a relatively junior person at the firm, and he did not have direct access to the people running the firm.  This shows, as you definitely get the feeling that many of Larry's stories are second-hand.  Finally, there is virtually nothing on Barclays' purchase of Lehman's assets.  Even House of Cards, with its single chapter on Lehman and Merrill, gave a much clearer picture of what happened.<br /><br />That said, there are several aspects of the book that I enjoyed.  I think Larry (or is it Patrick Robinson?) has an excellent way of telling stories.  They are vivid and filled with humor.  I loved the account of how Larry McCarthy (Larry McDonald's coworker and friend) lost $165,000 in blackjack, only to leave the casino hours later with $475k in cash.  I am not quite sure if the author was trying to make a point with this story...  He says: even if you're losing money but you think you're right, stay in your position...  I completely disagree with this mindset, since, as Larry himself says later, markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.  Either way, however, it was entertaining.  Furthermore, the author does an excellent job describing some of the more complex concepts in finance - CDOs, CDSs, convertible bonds, and how the overall housing market reached unsustainable heights.  Those not very familiar with these aspects of our economy will find Larry's explanations very clear.<br /><br />As an ex-Lehman banker, I am disappointed with the lack of detail this book provides.  While I enjoyed some of the stories, and it was interesting to read about some of the people I worked with, I can't shake the feeling that the story is very one-sided.  Larry makes Fuld seem like a complete reclusive moron, while Larry's friends are portrayed as brilliant financiers who saw the crisis coming from years away.  While there may be some truth to this, I find it hard to believe that things were as simple as Larry makes them out to be.  And finally, I just want way more detail.  I know it's unfair to compare this book to House of Cards, but at least some more on Lehman's long history would have helped.<br /><br />In conclusion, I recommend this book to anyone interested in a fun story and the general events surrounding the housing crisis - you will find relatively clear explanations.  However, don't expect to become an expert on why Lehman Brothers no longer exists.  As a finance professional, you will probably be disappointed.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+ excellent writing, with lots of humor<br />+ vivid stories of the author's friends and coworkers<br />+ clear explanations of the more complicated concepts in finance<br />+ gives a good picture of how/why the housing bubble occured<br /><br />Cons:<br />- more a story of the author's life rather than the collapse of Lehman<br />- very little history about the firm or its key leaders<br />- contains a lot of repetitive self-glorifying<br />- seemingly one-sided and over-simplified in its view on Lehman's leadership<br />- simply does not have enough detail on Lehman's bankruptcy and the events around itHe says: even if you're losing money but you think you're right, stay in your position...

B000002KON|5.0|This is the fourth release in the solid run of six excellent Kinks albums that started in 1966 with Face to Face and ended with Muswell Hillbillies in 1971. These represented The Kinks at their best.<br /><br />Arthur is most tonally similar to their best album, 1968's Village Green Preservation Society, and carries on that perfect combination of genuine nostalgia tinged with tongue-in-cheek irony. And the tunes are catchy!  Standouts are 'Victoria' 'Drivin'' and the hard-charging 'Brainwashed'. It was written as a concept album but don't worry about that, the songs are all perfectly enjoyable on their own without knowing the backstory.<br /><br />Try to find one of the remastered import versions of this CD with extra tracks (the singles and b-sides from the time).<br />The U.S. versions on Reprise were transferred in the early days of CD technology and sound poor in comparison to the more recently redone British versions.

B00007KWHP|4.0|This review is on the CD version without the bonus tracks.<br /><br />I've collected several Yes albums over the years because I admire the musicians and the complex songs they've created. However, I cannot stand Jon Anderson's voice. It almost ruins the whole experience for me.<br /><br />I've had the CD version of this album for years and it's languished on the shelf, played maybe once by my wife. I don't even remember why we bought it in the first place. Maybe because she was a disk jockey at the NCO club at Incirlik AB in Turkey. Anyway, this morning, I pulled it out at random and decided to listen to it on the way to work.<br /><br />The music brings back a lot of memories and just about every song on here has been played to death on the radio. That being said, I'm not as sick of Yes as four other bands that are played to death (and shall remain nameless).<br /><br />What has always attracted me to them was the complex music, with each band member contributing substantially to the mix, and nobody shoved into the background for filler. I particularly like Rick Wakeman and Steve Howe who I think of as the stars of this show. Chris Squire's driving bass parts wander all over the place (in a good way) and Bill Bruford's drumming compliments every song.<br /><br />I really had to put my prejudices aside to listen to this critically, as Jon Anderson's tenor voice grates on me. I really admire him as a musician and a singer, but I don't like his voice despite that admiration. If someone else did the singing, this band would probably be at the top of my list of favorites. Instead, they will always languish way down near the bottom.<br /><br />The thing that makes this such a great album despite the singer, is the complex songs, and all the influences that come out in the sound. I hear classical as well as jazz, with a bit of hard rock thrown in. I have no one favorite song, but then again, I've heard most of them on the radio so much, it would be hard to choose. I guess I like the longer cuts the best where they ramble around and just go for it.<br /><br />Admittedly a great band marred by my dislike for the singers voice. Still, if you don't mind his vocal qualities, this band should be one of your top choices for progressive rock. Highly recommended for anyone that can take Jon Anderson's singing.ble around and just go for it.    Admittedly a great band marred by my dislike for the singers voice. Still, if you don't mind his vocal qualities, this band should be one of your top choices for progressive rock. Highly recommended for anyone that can take Jon Anderson's singing.
B00288KNL8|3.0|I was disapointed in the 3D version, which is the reason why I had ordered this disk in the first place.  I could not see any difference between the normal version and the 3D.  I only had very brief glances in 3D, which did not compensate for the whole movie.
B00005LC1H|5.0|This is the perfect set. It has all the episodes as aired.<br />It also has extras such as outtakes, interviews and I believe voice-overs on sound track 2 from the producers/directors. You will NOT be disappointed with this set.<br /><br />As with The thin Blue line there is only 12 episodes, but I would rather have 12 great episodes like these, than more episodes that are hit and miss.  I can watch them over and over --- and I do!<br /><br />Jim
B000002KCI|5.0|This has to be one of the top rock albums ever recorded.  Neil and the Horse are in top form.  As great as everything on it is, Cortez the Killer towers far above the rest of the album.  That insane almost three minute instrumental to start the song... man it's beautiful, classic.  Everyone seems to have their own theory of what it's about but it's pretty obvious that the song isn't just about history.  But because Cortez is so great some other very good songs, namely Danger Bird kind of seem to get forgotten.  This is a tragedy.  This is the perfect album for a long drive or some solitary time.  It deserves your full attention.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|First, I have to take issue with the office review, which compares EVERWOOD to NORTHERN EXPOSURE and PICKET FENCES. Both of those shows had a touch of surreality that plays no role on EVERWOOD. I suspect that the reviewer was thinking more in terms of the small town setting, but I would compare the show more to family dramas like ONCE AND AGAIN. Nonetheless, it is an excellent series. It could easily not be. The story of a newly widowed big city brain surgeon relocating to a small Colorado town to start over with his young daughter and teen-aged son could easily descend into something trite and melodramatic, but EVERWOOD manages to avoid clich&eacute; and present a group of believable and likable characters. Moreover, Everwood itself takes on the feel of a place that you come to know and like. While I would still prefer to visit Cicely, Alaska more than Everwood, but it runs a close second.<br /><br />Watching the show made me appreciate more Greg Berlanti and his skills as a producer. I've enjoyed his work on BROTHERS AND SISTERS and absolutely loved ELI STONE (easily my favorite of the shows he has worked on). He has a real knack for creating characters and situations that are involving and that make you care about what will happen next. And I like that for the most part he avoids \\"a very special episode of EVERWOOD.\\" Even in the episode that deals with an eighteen-year-old girl getting an abortion, he does not sensationalize it. He doesn't make anything about that episode glib or easy, and even has a couple of surprising twists. But neither does he play it up for any cheap thrills. Furthermore, just the nerve to show an abortion on a TV show is pretty amazing in these hyper-politicized days. About 99% of the time on television a pregnant teen ends up having a miscarriage. Similarly, in an episode where a woman thinks her husband has had an affair with another woman, she learns that it was, instead, a man.<br /><br />The cast is solid enough. Everyone is at least competent, while a few are extremely appealing. Treat Williams is great in the lead as brain surgeon turned small town doctor. I also really enjoy Emily Vancamp in the show. I didn't know that she was in the show, but I enjoyed her a lot on BROTHERS AND SISTERS, where she plays the least mess up person in the larger Walker family. Even in this show, as a teen of around 16 or 17, she already showed a great deal of appeal. Some actors just radiate likability and she has that in spades.<br /><br />I'm really delighted to discover this series. I missed it the first time it was on the air, but I had always heard good things about it (several TV critics I read lamented that the new CW opted for renewing ONE TREE HILL rather than EVERWOOD). I've never seen ONE TREE HILL (though I've heard very little good about it so I doubt if I will ever be tempted), but the first season of this show truly makes me regret that they didn't keep it instead.ew are extremely appealing.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|I have had the privilege of seeing Whitney perform live twice and I can say with all honesty and sincerity that no one else has the voice that she has and **still** has. She has a very pronounced musical gift. As someone who grew up listening to Whitney I am so happy that she has found peace and is releasing fantastic music again. She has always been one of my very favorite entertainers because of her kindness and beauty, not to mention her unprecedented talent. Let us not forget that she was the very first female singer who had a string of number one hits consecutively and who also had the most successful soundtrack in the entire history of American music. That should count for a lot, at least in my book it does.     On her newest CD, \\"I Look To You\\" she does not disappoint. Whitney is beauteous and everlasting and strong and dignified. It's just such a glorious record that will cheer you up if you're feeling a little down.     When I listen to this it reminds of so many things. It's a reminder of second chances. It's a reminder of not judging others. It's a reminder of showing others compassion and love and respect. It's a reminder that talent comes in all shapes and sizes and colors. It reminds me to be thankful for what you have; not envious of what you don't. It's a reminder that we should never count someone out because faith will always prevail.     My favorite songs on this CD are probably your favorites, as well. Besides the title track, I also adore \\"Million Dollar Bill.\\" This is old-school Whitney, updated with lots of energy and fun. Every song fits perfectly together and it's really like listening to a poetic story of someone's multi-dimensional life.     \\"I Look To You\\" is almost like a gospel album you would expect to hear at church because it's so peaceful and tranquil and has such a great message. It's also a fantastic song to reintroduce Whitney and bridge that elusive gap of both the old and the new material with a personal reflection of what is to come.     I have a lot of respect for Mr. Clive Davis (not to mention Ms. Houston) for having the integrity to stand with Whitney all of these years. Of course she made him a lot of money and brought his company tremendous riches, but he could have thrown her to the wolves, yet he didn't. Just like this CD, he had faith in her. It is unfortunate that more people in \\"show business\\" do not have even one ounce of integrity that Mr. Davis has.     Like Whitney has for so many years, this CD has touched me and I hope it will touch you too. Whitney is the woman that she is meant to be; classic, determined, strong and omnipresent.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|(500) Days of Summer (Marc Webb, 2009)<br /><br />When was the last time you saw a romance that wasn't a chick flick? And by that, I mean a romance that takes chances with the boundaries of the genre, that isn't utterly predictable, that has a humor level somewhere above fourth grade and enough intelligence to actually pull it off. Seriously, when? I can't think of one since Return to Me almost ten years ago. Well, amazingly, now we have another one, which not only hits on all cylinders, but brings some top-quality acting to the mix as well.<br /><br />Tom (Brick's Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one of those guys who, in a less politically correct world, we used to call hopeless romantics. He's looking for that one true love. One day, he sees Summer (The Good Girl's Zooey Deschanel), and lightning strikes. The rest of the movie chronicles their five-hundred-day relationship in two parallel timelines. The first covers the first half (roughly) of that time, while they're dating. The second covers the second half, after they've broken up (this is not a spoiler; the trailer, the intro voiceover, and the first scene all reveal it).<br /><br />Yes, that's the entire plot. Thus, the movie has to hinge on its two main characters. I love Joseph Gordon-Levitt and will watch him in anything, so that base is covered. Deschanel, on the other hand, I've never been nearly as fond of, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect here. Turns out that this is the first movie I've encountered her in where she really shines instead of being an upscale Juliette Lewis clone. The chemistry between the two is completely believable, which seems to be increasingly rare these days, and Webb takes this movie to the next level in the little details. These characters have little quirks that don't exist as big emotional shortcuts later, they're just two kids being silly. Hey, Hollywood? In case you haven't noticed, this sort of thing works really well. Maybe you should use it in more rom-coms. Add in a few amusing, nerdy sidekicks and, well, you've got yourself a movie.<br /><br />I loved this. It's not something with the same gravitas as, say, Pontypool or Tokyo Story, but that's part of its charm. Well, that plus being the best romantic comedy in ages. See it. You'll probably love it. ****nd, well, you've got yourself a movie.    I loved this. It's not something with the same gravitas as, say, Pontypool or Tokyo Story, but that's part of its charm.

0823015017|5.0|I've just received my copy of \\"Polymer Clay Inspirations\\" and I can hardly wait to read it cover to cover and do the exercises. Not only is color theory (and different basic color systems)explained beautifully, but the photographs/examples inspire creativity on their own. I am very selective about what craft books I purchase, usually borrowing from the public library first to determine whether the book is a necessary reference item for my shelf. This time, I preordered and I am SO glad. This is a reference book I'll pick up time and time again - and one I'll leaf through when inspiration flags. I work in polymer clay and also do bead work and mixed media and this book will be a fabulous help in all mediums where color is concerned. Congratulations to Lindly Haunani and Maggie Maggio for having written a book I'd give 12 stars out of 10 to!
B000ANVPPQ|4.0|No, you could never get away with making a film like MCCLINTOCK! during these politically correct times--a Western version of Shakespeare's timeless 'The Taming of the Shrew' complete with its female lead character being publicly humiliated (meaning she gets spanked).  NOW would never let something like that happen these days, even when presented in good clean fun and with tongue firmly in cheek, which is what lends such rustic charm to this John Wayne classic.<br /><br />Wayne plays G.W. McClintock, a rancher/entrepreneur who, after years of hardship building his cattle empire, is now living the high life.  The beautiful Maureen O'Hara plays Mrs. McClintock who, now that she's been exposed to eastern culture and living, finds her husband crude, obnoxious, and boorish--yet still loves him.  The chemistry between the two (as it is in all their films together) comes as easy as breathing air; in fact, Wayne wears this role like an old glove:  in every scene he is exceedingly comfortable.  The two of them are pure fun to watch.<br /><br />But what is more enjoyable about MCCLINTOCK! is its plethora of other speaking roles, all of them done well.  Some of my favorites include Chill Wills, Jack Kruschen, Patrick Wayne, Stefanie Powers, Strother Martin, Jerry Van Dyke, Yvonne De Carlo, and Big John Hamilton (as you can tell, this film contains lots of characters).  MCCLINTOCK! is a sprawling, feel-good Western that is definitely one of The Duke's best--even though its misogynist bent might offend those who are a little sensitive.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

The only warning would be to makes ure you have a box of kleenex and make sure you are on vacation because you will not be able to put it down! Thumbs up to Jodi!
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This was Bob Dylan's third album.  It solidified the singer's status as the leader of the folk music boom.  It is perhaps not as accessible as his previous album, [[ASIN:B00026WU64 The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]], but it's still a great album.  The sings are great, with many of them being about social issues.  This album has ten more examples of why Dylan is the greatest songwriter of his generation.
0061150142|5.0|This book really touched my heart. I loved the idea how the author made the story about two kids who grew up together and from the day Emily was born they were placed in the same bassinet up to when they turned teenagers they were inseparable. These two kids who are practically one person combined together has an outstanding relationship and bond with each other. They couldn't possibly live without the other. Towards the end while Chris was in the witness stand and he explained in detail how he feels toward Em, I thought the words that the author used about \\"being home\\" was heartfelting. While and after reading this book, I couldn't stop thinking about it and I couldn't help being pulled into the story. This book is a tear-jerker and enchanting.
0786856297|5.0|The book is full of excitement, as well as the continuation.  Can't wait to see the movie premier in February '10.
0061537969|5.0|The moment I found out that this book is narrated by a dog, I wanted it. I was so curious on how the book would be like since I've never read a book narrated by a dog before. It's awesome how the author wrote the book in a dog's perspective and point of view. The book is truly sweet, heartfelt, and cute. I couldn't put the book the down and after I finished reading it, I couldn't stop thinking about the story. The story is like a little love story between a dog and a human. They are truly meant for each other.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Right off the top it is clear in \\"Lay It Down\\" Al Green found his groove & throughout this new collection of richly varied terrific songs, all are sung with passion & depth along with tremendous vocal skill that distinguishes his finest work.  \\"You've Got The Love I Need\\" flourishes with strings, choir and great guitar licks surrounding a smooth & prime vocal from the legendary singer blending fine with inspired vocal from guest Anthony Hamilton, this winner has hit sound all over it but radio today mainly plays \\"wannabes\\" they are pushing & are not in to the real thing, yet with lack of radio support this stunning set still won well-deserved Grammy Awards...too bad for talent starved radio audiences! Sublime love is celebrated in another new Al Green classic \\"No One Like You\\" and quality of vocals are timeless & in addition to his great rangy voice, Al Green co-wrote most songs in this tremendous set and continues to be prolific in this area. Past two releases feature current writing credits, \\"I Can't Stop\\" and \\"Everything's OK\\" are filled with great new songs that would have scored highly in better musical times than this bleek and musically bankrupt time zone that doesn't celebrate real musical talent. Bluesy and soulful duet \\"Take Your Time\\" with Corinne Bailey Rae is fine & engaging while super-fine \\"Too Much\\" is smooth & soulful. \\"Stay With Me (By The Sea)\\" featuring John Legend is another soulful gem in a program where all songs are winners!  Al Green is a timeless legendary giant who continues turning out sublime classic sets for all to savor and enjoy who love and embrace the finest music has to offer...Bravo Al Green and can't wait for the next!!!
B001OQCV2Y|3.0|Inglourious Basterds is Quentin Tarrantino's homage to the entertaining World War II action films of the 60s and 70s. Of all such films, 'Basterds' mostly resembles the highly entertaining \\"The Dirty Dozen\\". In 'Chapter 1' (unquestionably the best scene in the movie), Tarrantino raises his 'Dirty Dozen' to a higher plane. In his World War II epic, the Nazis' hatred of the Jews is not ignored (unlike these earlier action films). At the outset, Tarrantino's SS man, Landa, is wholly believable as the charming sadist who ends up murdering a Jewish family hidden under the floorboards of a French dairy farmer's home. Like many of the scenes in the film, the opening scene is dialogue heavy but the tension is so palpable that one sits engrossed until the scene's brutal and harrowing outcome.<br /><br />The reason why 'The Dirty Dozen' was so entertaining was that each convict 'misfit' had a distinct and extremely interesting personality. Tarrantino doesn't bother to develop any of his basterds as fleshed out people. Instead, all they can do is scalp Nazis or as one of them does (the so-called 'Bear Jew') beats Nazi brains out with a baseball bat. What's more, Tarrantino doesn't bother showing how they develop as a team and how they overcome obstacles leading to their reputation as professional killers. Instead, they're plopped down in occupied France and meet no real resistance. The whole charm of 'The Dirty Dozen' was that that they had to overcome not only the external obstacles of fighting the Nazis but deal with their own internal strife. In short, they were fairly plausible, believable characters. Not so with Tarrantino's group who are not only unbelievable but unsympathetic (they're as sadistic as their Nazi opponents).<br /><br />The problem with Tarrantino's narrative is that it gradually becomes more and more implausible and incoherent. I was willing to suspend my disbelief when Shoshanna, the Jewish girl, escapes while Landa murders her family (did his gun jam?) but how does she become the owner of a movie theater a few years later? Wouldn't the Nazis have uncovered her Jewish heritage? Tarrantino's portrait of Goebbals as a dilettante in the world of German cinema rang true but I question the assertion that he was the #2 man (next to Hitler) in the Nazi hierarchy (certainly Bormann, Heydrich and Goring had a lot more power).<br /><br />Visually, it was a nice touch in showing Hitler with an unflattering complexion as well as making fun of his out of control temper; but to reduce Hitler to a complete buffoon while other Nazi characters are quite believably scary, makes no sense whatsoever. Hitler, after all, was the brains behind the operation.<br /><br />Tarrantino does serve up some juicy characters which were highly entertaining. I liked Pvt. Fredrick Zoller (Daniel Bruhl) as he first appears to be a harmless, lovesick puppy dog, enamored with our Jewish cinema owner and actually exudes modesty despite having become a war hero and accidental movie star. And it makes perfect sense for him to morph into a sadistic stalker on the verge of rape when he shows his 'true colors' after confronting Shoshanna in the projection booth. In some ways, Zoller is more sinister than Landa.<br /><br />Kudos also to Diane Kruger as Bridget Hammersmark, the movie actress who's also a double agent. Despite its unpleasantness, the scene of Kruger's demise at the hands of the sadistic Landa pulls you in. Perhaps the best character in the movie is Major Dieter Hellstrom, played by the brilliant August Diehl, who ends up exposing Michael Fassbender's film critic turned spy in the basement tavern face-off. The way Tarrantino has the diabolical Major deduce it's 'King Kong' during the card game is utterly brilliant. Through Hellstrom's 'deduction', Tarrantino demonstrates that he has a profound understanding of the sinister nature of Nazi politics and ideology.<br /><br />Tarrantino, however, shoots himself in the foot in the final third of the movie. The Basterds are supposed to be a crackerjack professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English. And despite Hitler showing up at the premiere, there's absolutely no security (Shoshanna's black lover who plans to set fire to the building has free rein to walk around without being stopped once). In Tarrantino's warped universe, he somehow feels some kind of perverse satisfaction in having Shoshanna laugh at the Nazis as they are being burned to a crisp in an on screen rant.<br /><br />Finally, what really killed the film for me was the denouement where the sinister and charming Landa suddenly becomes a blithering idiot by offering to surrender to the Allies after allowing the Basterds' bomb plot to proceed. How could the \\"Hangman\\" of Occupied France suddenly deceive himself into believing that Lt. Aldo Raine, the notorious Nazi killer, would agree to his ludicrous demands and then keep his word?<br /><br />Inglorious Basterds contains a plethora of clever references to the history of cinema. Many of the scenes are overlong and talky but the dialogue is always crisp and never boring. Tarrantino's characters are a mixed bag--he's much more successful with his Nazi antagonists than his American protagonists. Particularly disappointing is Brad Pitt who has little to do except practice a Southern accent. With the exception of Hitler and SS Landa's final scenes, Tarrantino does a credible job of humanizing his Nazis. That doesn't mean he approves of them but it shows he knows what makes them tick.<br /><br />Tarrantino should have consulted with Daniel Mendelsohn before making his mad revenge fantasy. Mendelsohn, writing in Newsweek, gets it right: \\"An alternative, and morally superior, form of \\"revenge\\" for Jews would be to do precisely what Jews have been doing since World War II ended: that is, to preserve and perpetuate the memory of the destruction that was visited upon them, precisely in order to help prevent the recurrence of such mass horrors in the future.\\"k professional outfit but allow themselves to be easily apprehended at the film premiere because no one speaks any languages except English.

B000002UAR|4.0|Like most, if not all their prominent material, this is an obvious masterwork of grade A rock-pop, (here capturing the fabulous foursome riding the beginning of a legendary experimental creative crest) which hardly ceases to spring forth with gracefully executed originality, but still somehow lacks complete compositional solidarity to propel it onto any shortlists for greatest albums ever made-despite being there so often.
0756405890|2.0|Some reviewers had complained that the main character, Kvothe, is too much of a Mary Sue. Actually, he's like the head of the class at the Mary Sue Academy for the Unrealistically Gifted. If he were dropped into the Star Trek universe, he'd quickly shove Wesley Crusher and the younger James Kirk - two of the most notorious examples of the phenomenon from that canon - off center stage simultaneously. Even worse, he's not just accidentally a Mary Sue with some other qualities. Being so close to perfect is the very core of his character, the plot seems to hinge on it, even the other characters are aware of it as they're often forced to deliver strange gazes at awkward times so the audience will recognize the exact instant at which they recognized Kvothe's awesomeness. Even his missteps are reflections of virtue - being too brave, too witty, and so on. The one glaring exception is that the young Kvothe seems to be as singularly bad at defending himself as the older Kvothe is singularly good. It's so anomalous, without any explanation for how the Kvothe of the \\"mean streets\\" episodes could fail to appreciate the need for improvement, that it only makes things worse. Kvothe doesn't seem more balanced because of it; he only seems more hastily or clumsily drawn.    This lack of creativity extends elsewhere, as well. I've read nearly 400 pages, and Kvothe has finally met his Great Love in flashback. I don't mind slow pace, in fact I prefer it, but nothing original has happened in those 400 pages. The plot - idyllic childhood, sudden trauma, mean streets, admission to wizard school, and so on - should be very familiar to anyone who has read fantasy before. There's nothing particularly wrong with repeating these tropes, I didn't mind at all when Greg Keyes did it, but Rothfuss is no Keyes. Maybe more of a Feist or Jordan, or perhaps even Rowling. Kvothe's time at \\"the University\\" has been particularly tiresome. Character-wise we have the Loyal Friends (the very first people hemeets), the Insufferable Snob, the Inimical Master, the Inimical Master's Rival, the Avuncular Head Master, etc. Plot-wise we have all the familiar vignettes that play out like daydreams - perhaps credibly Kvothe's, but clearly the author's as well. There's no doubt whatsoever about who's who, doing what. Every character is there to be one thing and one thing only. Ron Weasley would bring a welcome dash of complex characterization. It's particularly offensive how Rothfuss portrays female characters, every single one of whom is primarily female and only secondarily anything else (if we're lucky). Out of 400 pages so far, I could probably recognize every one from another work and tell you who did it better. Enough.    All that said, it's not a terrible book. It's nowhere near bad enough to justify the accusation that the good reviews must be astroturf. Though uninspired, the writing is passable, and isn't peppered with the get-thee-to-an-editor howlers that characterize That Other Guy's work. I can see how people who don't mind the repetition and flat characterization, who appreciate a plain piece of wish-fulfillment more than I do, would find this book enjoyable. Writers as good as Ursula K. LeGuin and Orson Scott Card praise it (another point of contrast with That Other Guy), and as a Young Adult offering I might give it higher marks myself, but I'm just not enjoying it enough to finish.
B002M5ZCEU|5.0|Greetings to all,  If you are debating whether or not to buy these album. Let me  give you the facts. Yes this is the Whitney we all know and love. She has definitely matured and brings timeless music, with magical lyrics, and music with meaning. You will be happy to buy this album. She has a way of presenting a diva in the new age. Not out of date and full of class. You will find yourself listening to this album years from now and comparing it to her later and newer projects and saying, \\"My goodness, perfect timing.\\"
159102594X|4.0|I had modest expectations for this book, thinking it would be fun enough but perhaps a little lightweight, and it turned out to be far better than that.  Sure, the characters are a bit \\"oversaturated\\", but the characters are not quite two-dimensional and not quite Mary Sue. For example, Logen is a pretty classic barbarian, fighting fearsome almost-human warriors in the frozen north, hunted by the barbarian king he once served as champion, etc. etc. etc. We've seen his ilk a hundred times before; even his ennui reminds me of Elric or Corum. Bayaz the all-powerful wizard certainly has his deus ex machina moments too, to give another example. Nonetheless, Abercrombie doesn't just take this common material and use it as-is. He's a good enough writer to make each character unique. Logen is not quite Elric or Corum, even though he's like them. Bayaz is not quite Every Other Archmage. Glokta is a pretty unique character, not mapping easily onto any common archetype. The characters we're supposed to like sometimes turn out to have significant flaws - not just weaknesses but character defects, and in one case a shocking one. The characters we're supposed to dislike . . . well, there's still not really anything to like about them, but we learn to dislike them in different ways or for different reasons as the plot progresses. It's a funny thing about swords and sorcery that it's so full of these familiar characters and plotlines which authors must use to avoid losing their readers in worlds that are just too unfamiliar. However, the good authors learn how to walk that line, to mix enough of the familiar with the original, to make homage instead of parody. Whereas Rothfuss (for example) leaps over that line with abandon, Abercrombie stays neatly on the side that makes a good story. The characters and situations are mostly familiar, but not so much that they detract from the plot.    Say, how about that plot? Well, this is clearly the first of a series, the one where we assemblethe main characters for the adventures that follow, so it's a bit early to say for sure. What I will say is that it's not entirely clear who's on which side, or even what sides there are. There are some characters who will undoubtedly reappear in fairly obvious roles, some who will probably reappear but in less obvious roles, and others who will probably turn out to be irrelevant. There are important characters (e.g. barbarian king Bethod) we haven't even met yet but surely will. There are places and events and things that have been mentioned but not fully explained, which will probably figure prominently in later volumes, and a good pattern of such things (e.g. the legends of Bayaz's predecessors) being revealed as the story progresses. In other words, the foundation has been laid for a good story. The closest parallel I can think of is Keyes's Kingdoms of Thorn and Bone series, which was in an almost identical state at the end of the first volume and which turned out to be excellent. On the other hand, George R.R. Martin's Songs of Ice and Fire series showed similar promise after the first volume, before the plot started taking a back seat to the gratuitous introduction of new settings and new factions and new everything for each book. Even that was fun to read for the first few books or so, though. I expect that the next couple of books in Abercrombie's First Law series will also be fun to read, and it might even turn out to be something more.

1416594892|2.0|Disappointing, to the point where I doubt Le Carr&eacute; actually wrote it. The story is linear and predictable, the characters and their motivations bland, the politics too unsubtle and the story-telling mainstream - it is hard to believe this is the same author who wrote \\"The Little Drummer Girl\\", which was a masterpiece of story-telling for adults. The only part that was good was the build-up which was fun and the ambiguity of the main character being maintained throughout, but once the canvas is all laid out, it's all downhill from there.. A Le Carr&eacute;, this is not by a long shot!
0765342294|5.0|The Ender novels are some of the best science fiction written in the last 50 years.  They are intense, insightful, and strongly character driven.  Read them, if you are a fan of science fiction you will enjoy them.    If you are put off by OSC's more recent work, as many people are, don't worry.  The Ender novels are not filled with his nonsensical, factually wrong, and absurd political/religious propaganda.
B000001ESN|5.0|This is my favorite Rush album ever.     Natural Science is my favorite Rush song ever and the Spirit of Radio and Freewill are all time classics.     The lyrics and musicianship of this record are incredible    Natural Science (which is even better performed live) was a slap at the forgettable \\"New Wave\\" music of the era and at the music critics (whom Rush has never been a favorite of) that by and large dismissed them, probably because Peart's individualism clashed with their own individual philosophies.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|the production on some of the tracks is good, so some songs are catchy, just because of that, but i literally had to swallow in complete disbelief (shock even) several times throughout the whole album that this feeble, hoarse and somewhat braced voice is really that of world famous Whitney Houston... even Tina Turner, being so much older, still has more power, range, life and beauty in her voice, and is recognizable, which cannot be said of Whitney. To me, this album could well be titled The Ghost of W.H.... I cannot understand why they even encouraged her to record new material if her voice is like that. Looking at the album cover, perhaps the idea was to re-invent her as a 'mature singer', but in this time and age, you are hardly a 'mature' person if you're only in your mid forties, and certainly your voice isn't supposed to sound that aged either. I think it's actually very dangerous for her to get back into the full swing of a showbiz career, especially with such a deteriorated voice, as she is going to reap a lot of ridicule in the end, and the amount of false praise she will be given is of course just as poisonous for the soul. I really think that her victory over the very serious drugs habit is her greatest personal achievement in life, and a lot of the music she has made until then, has also been very very good. But trying to continue her career under these circumstances is, in my opinion, a receipe for a relapse and perhaps the complete disintegration of a life she has fought so hard to preserve. I think this album is already proof enough that showbiz is dangerous for her, and that somewhere deep down, despite all the success she has had, she isn't really cut out for it all, as she isn't able to see through what is being done with her, and to her.
B002M5ZCEU|4.0|At a time when producers rely on modern technological advances to get the sound required for a blockbuster hit, it's refreshing to hear that Whitney Houston's comeback album is, for the most part, tastefully done. Whether going for a classic, retro sound or an upbeat R&B vibe, this record manages to avoid extremes while keeping things fresh enough so that our younger music lovers might catch on to one of history's greatest female voices.    Whitney, legendary hit-maker Clive Davis and the songwriters (including some of today's hottest artists) combine for an effort that can appeal to young and old alike, with judicious use of synthesizers, drum machines, and vocal special effects for some tracks and classic recording techniques for others (the ballads \\"I Look To You\\" and \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" sound just like they used to).    Towards the end of the album especially, modern sounds and recording techniques do play a bigger role, but all the collaborations seem to work without going overboard...and most importantly, they make sure Whitney's vocal is still the centerpiece.    While every song is not the greatest ever written, the material is generally above average regardless of its specific genre or style...the aforementioned ballads are still Whitney's strength, and her voice sits beautifully in some of the best reverb effects I've heard in quite some time. Likewise, the musical arrangements on those tunes are simply breathtaking. Overall, this is one very good record...and better than I had expected.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This is a great album, 2nd only to The Wall and not by much. It was not promoted well and ignored by rock radio at the time but this does not mean it was a failure. Roger Waters and Pink Floyd at their best here. It's an album you need to hear all the way through to appreciate it. Very powerful material by one of the greatest rock bands of all time.
B0007MWZEK|1.0|I ordered the swivel sweeper at the two-for-one price,\\"just pay extra for shipping the second unit.\\"      However, when I received the units, I found that that company had billed my credit card for over [...] in shipping.  This was more than the cost of the basic units themselves.    I was initially mollified by the fact that the sweeper did work as well as promised.  But when it lost most of its speed within three weeks, and wouldn't work at all after a month,  I concluded that the swivel sweeper was a scam.      I could have returned the unit, but I would have encountered the same exorbitant shipping costs again.    I would say this was a very effective scam.  They didn't mention the shipping cost in the ads, they are accurate that the product works extremely well, they designed it for a short life span, they insulated the company against returns by the high return shipping cost, and they charged very high prices for the extras they wanted to sell during the initial purchase.
0393061310|1.0|I was very excited to read this book and then very disappointed.  It captured my attention for about half the book.  The author makes several points that he supports with some evidence and then retells them over and over and over.  Some of it is interesting but most is not the third or fourth time around.  I read a lot and I will not finish this book.
B0000CC61G|4.0|If you liked the first - and only - flourishing of progressive rock at the end of the sixties and beginning of the seventies, then you've probably spent some of the intervening time wondering why people didn't make music like that any more.  It turns out that they did, but nobody in the media thought it was important enough to tell you about it.  Written and recorded by Swedes in the nineties, Hybris is thoroughly and authentically English in style, principally calling on the graded interplay between electric and acoustic instruments that was the hallmark of early Genesis or Gentle Giant.  More than that, in its gloomy intensity, sustained across five long tracks, it comfortably surpasses anything recorded after 1975 by those English bands whose star burned so brightly and faded so quickly.   If early Crimson or Genesis acts on your nerve-ends, then there is very little chance that you won't like this. There are no big solos and the vocals are the least interesting part of the mix - but this is music that you can dive into and explore. It is constantly developing - time signatures change, lush mellotron-led passages are brushed aside by angular rhythms and abrasive guitar, naive flute themes grow into grand strident statements that are abruptly halted by pools of quiet uncertainty.  Anglagard clearly know where the dividing line between indulgence and creativity lies. It's a pity they only made two discs. Of course, you can always hit their website and demand more. Or check out fellow Scandinavians, Wobbler. Or both.
B001TW69J4|5.0|Mr. L.E.J. Fischer's review is dead-on. I don't wish to rehash what has been said, other than to add - do yourself a favor and pick this up; particularly if you are looking for a wonderfully fresh perspective on highly technical guitar work. Make no doubt, Tosin Abasi is pure monster, with a wholly unique and inspirational approach.    To answer a below reviewer's comment on the drum work; it is programmed by Misha Mansoor, polyrhythmic 7/8 string-weilding maven of DC-based Periphery fame. Though not listed in the liner notes, I am pretty sure he uses DFH (Drumkit From Hell, Tomas Haake sample library).    This is an incredible piece of programming work, to say the least. The last time I was this impressed with percussion programming as a work of art was Meshuggah's Catch-33. The mix here is superior to the infamous Catch-33 recording, however. The kick and rhythm guitar tracks absolutely leap off this disc, just begging to be cranked on a high-end system.    Want. More. Now!

The author points out easily overlooked similarities among species that are fascinating and thought-provoking. The author has a nice conversational style that is easy to follow, but he is not up to the standard of a Steven Jay Gould (yet?). He does include a number of pop culture references that makes me fear this book won't age well. Well worth the investment of time and dollars.

B001BTG3OQ|5.0|Okay, here's the (long winded) truth about the flash and it's \\"thermal shutdown problem\\".<br />First off, let me say that I have much experience in using different camera flashes and studio strobes as well as some repairing of them. I will start of by saying that this flash is the best portable camera flash in it's class that I have EVER used. Nikon knows what they are doing. They have an extremely high standard of quality and reliability. When they see a quality improvement / guarantee need, they will apply it. In the case of the SB-800 to the SB-900 one of the biggest and least appreciated quality assurance guarantees is the thermal cut off feature. Which, by the way, can be turned off or on. So all of those who are b****ing about it, just read your manual and turn it off!<br /><br />Okay, time for a cheesy quote: \\"With great power comes great responsibility\\". Nikon knew this. (speculation) They also knew the general public would not really understand the limitations of the flash in hand. So they incorporated a safety mechanism: \\"Thermal cut off\\", to prevent overheating due to extended maximum flash output. This sort of \\"circuit breaker\\" is also found in some pro studio strobes. Studio strobes usually use AC power and provide a much greater power output and are more likely to overheat and sometimes \\"blow out\\", so it is common to see some kind of safety mech built in to them. Portable camera flashes run off batteries and do not produce any where near the kind of power output than said strobes; so there is usually no critical need for such a safety. With the SB-900 however (and SB-800), Nikon has managed to build a very compact flash (yes, I mean compact if you consider it's power capability) that recharges very quickly and sustains a consistent powerful output. To do this, it requires a huge demand on the IGBT (like a capacitor) and sustained overheating would result in failure and eventually even damage to the flash. Of course they could have \\"pushed it\\" and programmed it to trigger at a much higher temp threshold or even eliminated the option all together. But it is good to have that feature. It's not that the flash overheats \\"easily\\", it's that the flash is offering more than maybe it should. With that much more power, comes that much more heat. (Especially from a compact unit without any cooling fans)<br /><br />Now for my silly analogy: \\"It's like the difference between driving a car that only goes 65mph (other flashes) and driving car that goes 100mph (SB-900 / 800). With the 65mph car, you can't get a speeding ticket (overheat / failure) on the freeway with the speed limit of 65mph. With the 100mph car you won't get a ticket either, until you start driving 100mph for an extended period of time on the same freeway. Then you will likely be stopped for speeding. Then, having a radar detector (thermal cut off feature) will warn you when a cop is around the corner and that you should slow down from 100mph to 65mph. You may ask yourself: why that speed limit? Of course, safety: limitations of the car and driver. Then you may ask: why make a car that goes 100mph if it is not safe to go that fast? (here is where my analogy doesn't follow exactly, but you get my point) You may have a need to go 100mph and it is good to have the ability. Often it may be fine to do so. Just know you are running the risks.\\"<br /><br />If you really need to turn off the thermal feature and shoot at max output consistently, chances are it will function just fine. Yes, it will get hot, yes your batteries will drain faster, and yes you will wait longer for each subsequent recharge but nothing major will happen: because it's designed to do that and it's a Nikon made in Japan. Just know this: Nikon or not, all electronics still have to follow the basic laws of physics. It's not ultimately good for the IGBT and circuitry to sustain such powerful flash firing as some do. You run the risk of degradation and failure. I've seen it happen, albeit rare.<br /><br />Basically, you should feel confident about the performance and reliability of this flash. It doesn't get any better...yet.
0307269981|5.0|It's a tragedy for world literature that Stieg Larsson is dead, and we'll never have more than three books with Lisbeth Salander as the heroine. She's an absolutely fascinating creation. This is the second book in the series, and every bit as riveting as The Girl with The Dragon Tattoo.<br /><br />In the eyes of Sweden's social services system, Salander is a deeply disturbed person who needs a guardian to supervise her and handle all her affairs. But unbeknownst to the authorities, she's a world-class hacker with a photographic memory, brilliant at chess, wildly rich from an Internet coup - and a vicious fighter. For relaxation, she has sex with men or women, as the spirit moves her, and reads books on spherical astronomy and higher mathematics. All this in a very small package: Salander stands less than five feet tall and weighs 90 pounds.<br /><br />The plot of this book is too complex and full of twists and shocks to summarize. But to oversimplify, three people are murdered because of a book two of them are writing about sex trafficking, and Salander, by a quirk of circumstantial evidence, becomes the prime suspect.<br /><br />Salander is in hiding for much of the book, baffling all the cops, well-wishers and thugs looking for her, while doing her own highly irregular detective work.<br /><br />In her twenty-five years of life, Salander has come in for a lot of sexual abuse. But she also has a genius for pay back. Her unique display of brains and aggression is utterly satisfying.<br /><br />The characters in this book are wonderfully drawn, the pace breathtaking and the fight scenes terrific. I can't wait to read the third book in the series.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|Whitney; I was a fan from the very beginning.  I was really hoping for a come back album, something to prove that you were truly cleaned up and back together.  The beginning of a new future in my audio collection.      This was not it, for me.  The obvious pandering to your \\"gay\\" audience was horriffic.  During \\"A Song For You\\" I thought this was going to be a great Jazz/Gospel number then all of the sudden at 0:01:28 where the devil did the disco beat come from.  You have guaranteed yourself a spot in every amature drag show for at least the next three or four years.    I expected the gravely voice.  I came away from listening to this sad. I was really wanting something that knocked my socks off.  You really missed it with this.  Happily I got to listen to the promotional copy before purchasing the album.    You should have looked to Clive.  I cannot believe that he would let this one see the light of day.
B001QOGY72|3.0|I hate to review a film for what it's not.  However, in the case of Talking Woodstock I'll make an exception.<br /><br />  The film has Elliott Tiber (Demetri Martin) suspending his big city dreams of becoming a theatrical scenic designer in order to rescue his financially floundering parents, at risk of losing their run down motel in White Lake, New York  Just when all hope seems lost, opportunity knocks, and in a rare burst of chutzpah Tiber throws the doors open wide, making it possible for the promoters of the Woodstock Musical Festival to stage the event on a farm in the neighboring town of Bethel.  What happens next, the preparations and consequences of managing the multitudes, the making of friends and forging relationships make up the bulk of the film.  The performances are uniformly outstanding, with special kudos going to Eugene Levy as Max Yasgar, whose farmlands were used to house the event, and Leiv Schreiber as a gun toting transvestite.<br /><br />  Enjoyable in its own right (certainly worth seeing), the film is deficient in three key areas: 1) Based on Tiber's memoir, subtitled \\"A True Story of a Riot, a Concert, and a Life,\\" what's missing from Ang Lee's adaptation is the \\"riot,\\" as in the Stonewall Inn riots that ignited the Gay-lib movement.  Tiber, who is gay, was present at the riot and vividly documented his experiences in his book.  2) When we meet Elliot he seems aimless and unoccupied, so why not help out his parents?  Having read the book, I know why: he had to abandon a very active social/sexual life in Greenwich Village and a truly promising career in the theatre; none of which is communicated in the film.  Lee does not skirt the issue of Tiber's sexuality; he simply reduces it to an afterthought in lieu of a focal point.  3) The lack of back story about the parents: who are these crazy people?  What has made them the way they are?  Tiber's mother (played by Imelda Staunton) makes Ma Barker seem like Donna Reed.  This is the sort of role Shelley Winters perfected in films like Next Stop, Greenwich Village: a manipulative, emotional succubus feeding on the aspirations of her young.<br /><br />  For the most part director Lee shies away from any in-depth character development or exposition and instead focuses on the superficial personality traits of Elliot and his parents, and all the \\"whacky\\" characters they encounter.  Unfortunately, \\"the concert,\\" like Tiber's sexuality, is not a focal point.  Indeed, the film is bereft of any archival footage featuring artists or performances.  Finally, though entertaining on a number of levels, this film about a \\"concert\\" never truly finds its voice; it simply does not sing.y Winters perfected in films like Next Stop, Greenwich Village: a manipulative, emotional succubus feeding on the aspirations of her young.

0545123267|4.0|As a middle school English teacher, I'm always looking for books that are interesting, action-packed, but also smart and thought provoking -- not just for my students, for me too.  Was the book perfect?  No.  What book really is?  However, I thought the book is entertaining and intelligent.  It is a heart warming story of young loves that gives teens the credit they deserve -- that they are capable of having strong, meaningful relationships.  You can't help but be pulled into these character's struggles and unwaivering love for one another.  I also enjoyed the author's story telling technique.  Hearing from both characters keeps the story interesting and provides opportunities to discuss and analyze the two characters.  The author's word choice and sentences are often almost musical, yet still easy to read.  If you like Twilight, I think you will like this book as well.  For one thing, it's better written, and the story is equally compelling.  I recommend the book for any reader who enjoys fantasy/romance novels.  Can't wait for a sequel!

B00000255F|5.0|I was born the year after this album came out - so for years I struggled to understand the appeal of \\"the Boss\\" to myriads of people.  I eschewed listening to anything that didn't recieve the \\"thumbs up\\" of my age group.  As I myself and my musical tastes matured, I began to slowly dip my foot in to the tepid, yet inviting waters of the larger ocean of music out there.  Low, and behold...there was Bruce Springsteen.<br /><br />I personally love this album as a woman, a working class hero, and as a music lover. Springsteen emotes every syllable he utters with heart-rending clarity and power.  You are transported to the world he creates, you become it and absorb every detail. He was a young man, crazy, intense, wild with passion. In hot pursuit of women, the american dream, and a better life. Now we know where he was headed, but when this album came out the future was spread out before him like a lonely stretch of highway.  With Born to Run he announced to the world he would step behind the wheel and drop the hammer. This album is such a subtle, gentle, poignant auditory seduction and you don't even realize it until the album is finished.  Masterpiece? One of the Best Rock Albums of All Time?<br /><br />Music is ultimately subjective and Bruce asks you the listener to be the Judge.
0525478183|4.0|I'm conflicted about this book. I have read John Green's work before, and I love his writing style and characters. However, PAPER TOWNS does, as other reviewers have mentioned, tread well-worn ground: in many ways, his characters Quentin (\\"Q\\") and Margo may as well be clones of Miles (\\"Pudge\\") and Alaska in LOOKING FOR ALASKA, or Colin and his Katherines in AN ABUNDANCE OF KATHERINES.<br /><br />The formula seems to be the same: Take one intelligent, quirky, neurotic, nerdy-geeky guy. Add one unattainable, mysterious, beautiful/bad-ass/brilliant girl with at least one deep flaw, not immediately apparent, who this guy obsesses over anyway. Throw in a dash of ethnically random friends who are even quirkier than the guy, and about as intelligent, which results in incredibly quirky, witty, though sometimes hokey, banter between them.<br /><br />However, Green executes this formula excellently. I'm torn between giving PAPER TOWNS or ALASKA the crown, here, since I liked different things about the books. I think ALASKA had the better plot, since PAPER TOWNS starts off with engines roaring, switches gears abruptly, chugs along at a steady pace, then peters to a put-putting halt. There's so much beautifully worked tension that builds and builds, but toward the last third of the book, I found the suspense exhausting and started reading so fast the words blurred, just to get to the end. When I did hit that final climactic scene, it was anti-climactic. I went through the final pages, hoping, hoping, then cried, \\"What? Seriously? Was that IT?\\" and wanted to throttle a certain character.<br /><br />Although... I suspect Green intended the ending to be a little anti-climactic, at least according to the setup of the story and the expectations of Quentin, which I shared. I don't think Green wanted PAPER TOWNS to be a book that fulfilled readers' desires for a tidy plot, perfect romance, or happy ending, since these literary devices rarely occur in reality. PAPER TOWNS appears to aim higher, and deeper, for a story that makes you question what fulfillment and purpose actually mean. His exploration of the term \\"paper towns\\" being a prime example. But still, I can't say it wasn't disappointing.<br /><br />Different readers will take away different messages from this book. I recommend that you read it if you're looking for beautifully written contemporary YA, or if you like literary explorations of character.

0439023491|5.0|When I started CATCHING FIRE, I was totally into it. I got to the halfway point and started to feel more and more anxious. Like twitchy anxious. And since gone are the days of sitting around all day doing nothing but reading a single book, I found myself moving through my regular day thinking about it constantly, worrying about the characters I care about so much that at night when I went to pick it up I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO DO IT. The steady building up of tension and pain that Suzanne Collins does so fiendishly well was too much and my mind skittered away from it in favor of less treacherous waters.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta are home once more. Heralded as heroes they reluctantly take up residence in the mansions reserved for Hunger Games victors in their beleaguered District 12. Given the Capitol's idea of \\"enough time\\" to recover and lick their wounds, they must soon set off on the obligatory Victory Tour of the districts of Panem. As always, they are accompanied by their mentor--the irascible Haymitch--as well as Katniss' faithful entourage, including the savvy stylist Cinna. As always, they are under the watchful eye of President Snow. For in the interim time between Katniss' unprecedented ending of the Hunger Games and the launch of the Victory Tour, the Powers That Be have learned a thing or two about just how much of a survivor Katniss is and what and most particularly who she cares about. Knowing what they know, and without any doubt at all of what horror will rain down on her head should she set one toe out of line or let fall one word off script, Katniss herself must do what she does best and figure out a way to stay alive.<br /><br />Remember how you felt the whole time you were reading [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]]? Like you might never find the bottom of your stomach again? Like the tips of your fingers were permanently flattened from pressing too hard on the book? Well, multiply those feelings by ten and add to it the interminable guessing game of what will happen next and you will have the approximate effect of CATCHING FIRE. That is why I put it down halfway through. It was just too stressful! I could feel all the pain laid out neatly in a row just waiting to befall Katniss and Peeta and Gale. And honestly it made me a bit angry because it felt like I was trapped in there with them and there was nothing was going to stop the inevitable heinousness. This is not to say it's not a fabulous book. Because it is. Seriously enjoyable. I just had to stop and let my fingernails grow back a bit before I could continue on. Because when I did pick it up again I sat down and read it through to the end. Suzanne Collins brings the intensity like you can't believe. Even having read [[ASIN:0439023483 The Hunger Games]], I wasn't prepared for it. And it's so much worse when you're already hurting for the characters when you open the book. But that's also the lovely thing about it and it is why I loved this one more than the first. There's more Gale (Team Gale!), more Peeta (the boy really is rather alarmingly sweet), more Haymitch (grrr), more Cinna (yay!), more Effie and Co. (hehe).

B001QOGY72|4.0|It's strange, watching a movie about a time you never lived in, a culture you don't understand, and music you never listened to. I may be unqualified to review Ang Lee's \\"Taking Woodstock,\\" which tells the story of how that legendary concert came to be in the summer of 1969. As someone who wasn't yet born when it took place, I can't say that I related to anything being depicted onscreen. All I can say is, as a story with characters, I found it very entertaining. It focuses very little on the concert itself, but that's okay because Lee wasn't trying to recreate the \\"Woodstock\\" documentary released in 1970; he wanted nothing more than to present a light-hearted romp about the people who made Woodstock happen. He succeeded for the most part, even with the occasional lapse into contrived comedy.    Having gone broke in New York City, interior designer Elliot Teichberg (Demetri Martin) moves back home to the Catskills of Upstate New York, where his parents operate a failing, dilapidated motel. When he hears that a neighboring town refused to give a permit to organizers of a music festival, he offers the organizers a permit of his own, which he obtained by being the president of the Bethel Chamber of Commerce. He and the head organizer, the always relaxed Michael Lang (Jonathan Groff), then strike up a deal with local dairy farmer Max Yasgur (Eugene Levy), who agrees to provide his own acreage as concert space. Knowing that this venue could potentially attract thousands of people, Michael buys out the Teichbergs' motel for the entire season. At last, Elliot and his family are making real money. Of course, they still have to cope with hippie overcrowding, protesting locals, and other technical and emotional woes.    This relatively simple plot is livened up with a slew of side characters. Elliot's mother, Sonia (Imelda Staunton), is a Jewish Russian immigrant so desperate to avoid poverty that she doesn't realize how her actions have been harming the motel. His father, Jake (Henry Goodman), also an immigrant, has long since come to believe that throwing in the towel is the only way to deal with his wife. Elliot's best friend is Billy (Emile Hirsh), a Vietnam veteran who shows signs of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. A contemporary theater troupe, led by Devon (Dan Fogler), lives in the Teichbergs' barn and occasionally perform at one of Elliot's own \\"festivals,\\" which consist of nothing more than playing a classical record (although he does hope to attract a string quartet). Devon and his actors know how to make a lasting impression; they end practically every performance by stripping naked and dancing. Probably the most interesting side character is Vilma (Liev Schreiber), a transvestite ex-marine who volunteers as Elliot's chief of security.    I probably would have enjoyed \\"Taking Woodstock\\" more had I been emotionally invested. But that's hard to accomplish when you don't have the first clue about what it was like to live in the 1960s. I saw this movie with my father, and while he never had the chance to attend Woodstock, he did have some experience with the culture. With that in mind, he assured me that this movie was a fairly accurate depiction of the era. There was, in fact, one joke I could relate to and found funny. As Elliot and Max survey the fields during construction, Max recalls witnessing a serious act of greed: \\"I saw someone charging a dollar to fill a water bottle. A dollar. For water. Can you believe it?\\"    All cultural and generational gaps aside, the film is an enjoyable experience, at times because of its depth of character, at times because of its visual components. There's one great shot, for example, of Elliot riding on the back of a policeman's motorcycle through an impossibly long line of people making their way towards the concert; it's difficult to say whether or not this shot relied on CGI, especially as it widens to reveal how far the line of people extends, but I can say that, whatever techniques wereemployed, it was powerful, direct, and just a little bit funny. An obvious use of CGI can be found in the scene involving Elliot and a stamp of LSD. At one point, Elliot observes the crowd camped along the hills, which in this case are brightly colored and literally rolling, like waves. In some scenes, Lee relies on the same technique he utilized in \\"Hulk,\\" in which the screen is split into comic book panels. This is effective, but when you have three different conversations going on at the same time, it can also be distracting.    There are a few things left unexplained. The issue of Elliot's sexuality, for example, is alluded to so delicately and infrequently it's curious why it was deemed a necessary subplot. There's really no way to account for Michael Lang, who's so easy going and confident that it's hard to take him seriously, especially when he bases his decisions on good vibes. And I can't say I appreciated the aftermath of Elliot's parents eating marijuana-laced brownies. Rather than going for something genuine, the scene instead goes for desperate, broad comedy, which goes double for Elliot's mother since she's usually a hotheaded worrywart. But on the whole, \\"Taking Woodstock\\" is a pleasant movie with fun characters and a decent story. I'm sure older generations who understand 1960s culture and know more about Woodstock will also enjoy this movie, probably more than I did.

0307588335|2.0|More than anything else, this book made me appreciate how well written some of the other business books I've read are.  I appreciate that it's impossible to be completely objective, and the author is perfectly entitled to his own opinions.  But somewhere along the line, he stops even trying, and the book becomes more of a personal rant than a recounting.  He spends just a bit too much time and effort trying to portray himself as one of the \\"good guys\\", and he thinks you should pat him on the back because he cares about people.  Like other reviewers, I thought it was pretty rich that he was a fan of free markets right up until the point that it hit his own pocketbook, and saying that Lehman's failure was Paulson's fault was quite an interesting statement.    Also some interesting failures of editing - clearly could have used a bit more proofreading.  There's one point where the same several sentences are used multiple times in a page - you can tell there was some copy and pasting as they worked on structuring the narative, and they never sat down and cleaned up the final version.    I don't know if there are any other Lehman books are out there, but would probably recommend you choose one of them instead of this if you have a choice.  It's not that this book is horrible, just that it's a far cry from many other good business reads.
0312360266|4.0|This story revolved around teenager Zoey Redbird who is very unhappy at her home. Her mother who was at this point married to a man who was controlling her life. Zoey's mother doesn't pay much attention to her. The story starts off with Zoey being marked, which in turn means she has to start attending the vampire finishing school (House of Night).<br /><br />This book mainly deals with character developments of Zoey and some of the main friends and enemies she will have at her new school. It also deals with some of the characteristics of the school and what is mainly taught there. She has to deal with a new life, trying to fit in and the loss of her old life.<br /><br />I usually don't like the main character of the story and it remained true in this one. Zoey to me was not very likable, she was too whiny and sometimes too self centered. Her supporting characters however made all the difference to me and I enjoyed reading about them. They didn't sound like any teenager I know which sometimes got a little bit annoying.<br /><br />It dealt a little with the mythology of Nyx but in my opinion not enough. The aspect I really enjoyed is it being a matriarchal society, which is a pretty good way of empowering young women. The only thing I would have liked to see is the main character herself live up to the part, which in my opinion she didn't.<br /><br />It's a little bit hard to read at some points especially the beginning but I ended up enjoying the idea of the story. It could turn into an amazing series if done right.
0307269981|4.0|I enjoyed this sequel to the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. While it is a bit burdened with bringing the reader up to speed, it expands and develops the Salander character nicely. Stieg skillfully pushes the envelope a bit with the Fermat's enigma metaphor. It reminded me a bit of another book I purchased on Kindle, The Sin Code, which layers and enriches a compelling story with a quirky bit of math. Support these Kindle authors-- buy both Stieg's new book and The Sin Code. Strong positive recommendation.

The words wrap nicely but would benefit from better spacing and bullet points around examples. Not bad but there are better editions.

This movie is creepy, dark, bloody, sad and catches your interest from the get-go.  The story line takes some time to come together, but the movie holds your interest well enough to keep you going, and I found myself waiting, wondering what was going to happen next.  The scenes are harrowing, and you feel for the victim.  This was a great movie, playing on all your senses, and will leave you thinking and pondering it for days to come: just what good movies are supposed to do.

Wesly Gibson, is a nerdy accountant who loves Googling his name to see if there are any hits and who is harrassed at work by an abusive woman who love to snap a stapler at work  He is drawn into a plan to kill a world class assassin.      At the beginning we see a top assassin being set on by a bunch of would be assassins.  He takes them all out but seemingly super powers only to taken out by a long range bullet fired by Cross, the most deadly assassin of all.      Fox (Angelina Jolie) approaches Gibson in a drugstore just as Cross attacks.  Fox fends him off and takes Gibson with her in a desperate escape via a wild car chase.  She eventually tries to recruit him to a secret society of assassins.  Gibson learns that he has some innate abilities that only one other person had (his father) that allow him to raise his adreline level to the point where he has superhuman abilities.      Gibson wants no part of this but is forced to join when he learns that Cross was the one to kill his father.  So begins the training more rigorous than any Kung Fu movie where Cross is beaten, attacked with knives and forced to put his hand in an active loom to extract a moving object.    The movie is action packed throughout in mostly a cartoonish way where falls from great heights, impossible stunts and the ability to bend a bullet's arc to one's will are the norm.  You realize that this is almost a live action video game where the characters take all kinds of punishment but are fine the next time.    I generally enjoyed the film because I treated more as a farce than a real-life action thriller.  If you liked the Kill Bill movies, you should like this film too!

Oh, don't look for anyone not detestable in it. Heck no. That's what's so funny. Masterbation is sooooo funny. Gosh, how clever to have your character masterbate. I guess that's why he was a genius, huh? I never would have thought of that. Anyway, better buy it and better love it. Everybody does.
B000A2UBN4|4.0|In Martin Scorsese's remake of the 1962 thriller, \\"Cape Fear,\\" Robert De Niro is cast as the villain with a vendetta, Max Cady. Max was put away for fourteen years for battery (but is later revealed to be rape) and finds the time to educate himself. He reads lots of books, gets close with God and eventually comes to the conclusion that his lawyer, Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) wronged him. It turns out Bowden suppressed evidence that would have at least lightened the sentence, and upon his release, Cady sets out to make sure each and every day of his life is a living nightmare. He covets Bowden's wife (Jessica Lange), corrupts his teenage daughter (Juliette Lewis) and nearly destroys his career and credibility, forcing the family into hiding. It seems there is nothing Cady isn't willing to do to seek vengeance and he is so smart about it that it leaves the slippery lawyer helpless and desperate, much in the same way he left his client all those years before.<br /><br />While it's not one of Scorsese's best or most critically beloved films, \\"Cape Fear\\" is at least a rarity in that it is a remake that is better than the original. Sam Bowden's character in this film, as portrayed by Nolte, is a much more layered and complex one than in the original, thus making it difficult to distinguish who the bad guy is. Heck, if it weren't for a few scenes of graphic violence that show off Cady's mean-streak, you'd likely be left in the dark as to who you're supposed to root for. De Niro's turn as Max Cady is possibly one of his most colorful and most intense since \\"Taxi Driver,\\" and even went as far as to earn him an Oscar nomination the following year. His performance in this film is a testament to how versatile an actor he can be, and his portrayal of the cold-blooded yet well-read killer will stick in your head for days. Take a scene where he seduces Juliette Lewis' character. Taboo for its time (yes, even for the 90's) it is no doubt one of those scenes that will make your skin crawl and marks the point where you realize these aren't stock characters we're dealing with here.<br /><br />Scorsese's take on the material is very much old-school and Alfred Hitchcock inspired. The original score from composer Bernard Herrmann is left intact and helps push the mounting terror over the edge, making the film seem like a nightmare you just can't wake from. \\"Cape Fear\\" is, at its core, a chilling thriller where its characters spend most of the time desperate and frantic. They make bad choices that lead to an intense final act that has earned its place in Hollywood history. Truly an intense film about ugly characters delivered with a touch of class by its director and filled out with performances that range from great to legendary. If one thing can be said about this movie, it's that it will stay with you for a long time after watching it.arks the point where you realize these aren't stock characters we're dealing with here.

B002KAOSEW|2.0|A good start, but after that things go downhill fast. This is bound to happen when to many story lines, politics and the Reacher character become entangled in each other. The author uses pepper and salt to explain this in his book, but in the end he only manages to solve the problem by going nuclear. If you like Reacher, give this one a miss.
1594202249|4.0|This was my first Thomas Pynchon. I was at the airport, not wanting to spend the flight actually working - and it was too short for a movie. So I stopped in the bookstore. I was specifically looking for something to read that felt like a break from the droll scientific literature that I'm inundated with as a PhD student in Geography.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Tom Robbins ([[ASIN:0553348973 Still Life with Woodpecker]]) and heard a review of Pynchon's new book on NPR that made me think that maybe this could be a new favorite author. I love good play with language and stories that are far fetched. The only reason I've made it past the glaring technical road bumps in Dan Brown's books ([[ASIN:0743497465 Deception Point]]) were the easy writing style and the fantastic yarn. In contrast, I've been working my way through [[ASIN:015603297X Foucault's Pendulum]] for nearly six years now. Sure, the Eco's story is equally fantastic and lacking in road bumps - but each page is a challenge.<br /><br />So, enough about me - I'm basically a reader who likes crazy stories and good writing... Inherent Vice was successful on both counts. The story line is byzantine - although not to the extremes of Robbins, Eco or Brown. And the writing is enjoyable - if at times a little overly influenced by pot and LSD.<br /><br />The main character, Doc Sportello, is likable but hard to really identify with. He plays out this line between pot head and cop lover that's a little hard to nail down. Robbin's character, by contrast, become your lovers and long-lost friends by the end of the book - you develop an intimacy that you never want to end. As for Doc Sportello, well, I hope he doesn't come calling again...<br /><br />The story is an odd mix of psychedelic 60s flashback and classic gumshoe fiction. It's an interesting romp around LA informed by the kind of 20/20 vision that only comes from hindsight. For instance, Doc relies on a friend who's hooked into ARPAnet (the technological predecessor of the Internet) for information that, while accessible today via the WWW, wasn't even a pipe dream in 1969.<br /><br />Having read his latest, I've now gone back in time and have his first novel, [[ASIN:0060930217 V. (Perennial Classics)]], on my nightstand.ion that, while accessible today via the WWW, wasn't even a pipe dream in 1969.

Only a woman who has gone through tremendous pain can sing with that type of depth and passion. There was also redemption in her music.  The kind that we need to heal. Of course, I bought the CD and it was worth every penny.    The selections are diverse, from up tempo R&B to ballads.

I rarely follow any recipe exactly--I often look at several and make my own. With this cookbook, I am doing the same. No reason to use all the cream and butter. Substiute milk for cream, etc. Cook vegetables less.    This is an invaluable cookbook both for the techniques and the classic French recipes.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|No one is looking for her to fail; but let's not pretend that this album is a great album. This album serves more of an outgoing party for Clive Davis than a Comeback for Whitney Houston.  The songs and her vocals are mediocre at best. It is time for her people (The Stans) to be honest and give a true and accurate review of the album. By attacking others who are not praising this release is just bad form.  As a whole, the I LOOK TO YOU album is not a comeback record, an essential album nor the second coming of Jesus Christ.  Accept it!

She didn't have the songs on here that required her to hit those high notes like she did on I Will Always Love You but what she does have is a Great Cd in my opinion.

You can tell that there was not a lot of studio cover uup on this you can really hear the lovely voice that we have heard in the past.Great job Whitney.
0439023491|4.0|So a few days ago, I hunkered down and read CATCHING FIRE! I had many of the same feelings that I had when I read THE HUNGER GAMES; and overall I have to say that I loved it! I knew it was going to be hard to live up to my expectations (and I don't think the book isn't without a few very minor flaws,) but I think it was an excellent story and did not disappoint. I definitely include both THE HUNGER GAMES and CATCHING FIRE on my must-read list!!!<br /><br />I am having a hard time writing this review -- I don't want to give anything away. And it's very difficult for me to \\"talk\\" about this book without giving away any spoilers. Under no circumstance do I think a reader should pick up CATCHING FIRE and have any idea of what's going to happen. This book is chock full of surprises and so much fun to read!<br /><br />Anyway, I'll start here: I thought CATCHING FIRE was terrific and it definitely held my attention throughout. I know not everyone is going to agree with me, but I liked how the author spent more time establishing some of the background and character development in the first half of the book. While I did enjoy the \\"game\\" aspect of both novels, I'm not sure CATCHING FIRE would have kept my interest as well if it had predominantly taken place in the arena. I think I would have felt as if this novel were too similar to THE HUNGER GAMES, so I definitely appreciated learning more about the history of Panem and Katniss' state of mind. Having said that, I did feel that the last half of the book was extremely exciting and very reminiscent of what I loved about THE HUNGER GAMES. Although, I'm not entirely sure that I didn't feel like the last third of the book was a bit rushed. Maybe it's just that the action was fast-paced and I wanted more!<br /><br />As was the case when I read THE HUNGER GAMES, I still really liked the characters in CATCHING FIRE, especially Katniss and Peeta. I loved Katniss in the first book, and I appreciated that Katniss had changed a lot from her experience in The Hunger Games -- she seemed to have matured as a result. I liked that Katniss could be Katniss in this story, whereas she was forced to play a part in THE HUNGER GAMES to survive. I definitely think I gained a better understanding of her in this novel. I thought the author did a wonderful job of creating conflict in Katniss' life and showing what the overall effects of this were on her. Even though Katniss' life certainly wasn't reflective of a normal 17 year old in today's society, I still think kids will relate to her and even look up to her. Despite what she had been through, she still had many of the same fears, concerns and insecurities that all teenagers have.<br /><br />I was left a bit speechless when I finished this book (and if you've met me, you know I'm not often at a loss for words.) Unlike THE HUNGER GAMES, where the book ended and I was curious about what was going to happen to Katniss, CATCHING FIRE just ended so abruptly... and with some huge cliffhangers! I am dying to know what's going to happen next, and I cannot believe that I have wait what seems like a very long time for the next book.

B001C4CI8U|4.0|From the first episode, I was hooked. True, I only tuned in cause of JJ Abram's involvement, and me being a complete LOST freak, I figured, why not? I am so glad I did take the time to watch Fringe because I just loved the first season. It is very sci-fi and creative and has one of the best characters on TV- Walter, played to perfection by John Noble. He's not even the main character but he steals every scene he is in. He plays dad to Joshua Jackson's character and it's really nice to see him on screen again. Anna Torv plays Olivia, and she is technically the star of this, though she is also the show's weakest link. Her acting is not great, though she does improve towards the end.     There is a barrage of minor characters, some important, some not, and sometimes, it can be a bit tricky keeping track of all those people. There is a good mixture of drama and suspense and of course those comedic moments that come out of nowhere. Almost every episode starts the same way-with some freakish incident involving a person or place. And, well, it really is more fun to watch than to explain it. To be honest though, it was all getting a tad repetetive towards the end there, but then the season finale happened and things just clicked and you almost get a jaw-dropping experience. Completely worth it. Hopefully the 2nd season is just as interesting.
B0009UC810|5.0|It's true, even James Brown (and on the documentary) admits that this movie sparked their career. Everyone but Ray Charles suffered during the disco/funk of the 70s. Anyway, this is one of the best musicals ever, though really not a traditional musical as there are more staged numbers than actual people breaking out into song to advance the plot. Aykroyd and Belushi really had a passion for the music and it shows. And this musical actually has the two main characters wanting to achieve something (unlike recent ones geared towards kids and they somehow garner a fanbase). And though featuring a wide array of blues legends, this is probably the movie that started my fascination with actors who aren't known for their singing being featured in this genre. Despite what people say (and again according to the documentary), the brothers can actually sing a lot better than most professionals, even by today's standards. The songs (I know there's only so much you can emote in the studio recordings but the live versions in the films are better) that really show how passionate the two were are Everybody Needs Somebody to Love, Sweet Home Chicago, Gimme Some Lovin' and Jailhouse Rock. As mentioned before, there a plenty of musical guest stars; James Brown (performing live to a gospel number), Aretha Franklin (with a faster paced rendition of her number one hit Think), Ray Charles (his song I've never heard originally but he is the second best pianist I've heard, though the best in this genre), John Lee Hooker (again, not a song I've heard before but is great nonetheless) and Cab Calloway (performing his standard Minnie the Moocher). And there a host of celebrity cameos from Frank Oz (performer of many Muppets and Yoda), Twiggy, John Candy, Steven Spielberg and Carrie Fisher (who isn't as good with fire arms as Princess Leia).<br /><br />When it comes to which version I'd rather watch, it's probably going to be the theatrical release. The only reason to watch the longer version is for the extended musical sequences (Old Landmark, Boom Boom, Minnie the Moocher and Jailhouse Rock). Other than that, the additional scenes really don't add much to the story, other than to make this great movie plod along.extended musical sequences (Old Landmark, Boom Boom, Minnie the Moocher and Jailhouse Rock).

0439023491|5.0|This book continues shortly after The Hunger Games finishes. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark are back home in District 12 but things are not all joy for the victors. Katniss receives a visit from the President of the Capitol warning her that he knows all of her secrets, and during the Victory tour that she and Peeta must convince the other districts that their love is real. It is even announced on TV that their wedding will be hosted by the Capitol.<br /><br />However, all is not well in Penam. The last time there was a rebellion, District 13 was nuked from the map, and The Hunger Games began to remind the districts of their submission and subjugation to the Capitol in this new country of Penan in the ruins of former North America. The Capitol each year forces each of the 12 provinces to draw names of a male and female tribute. The tributes are drawn from all people between the ages of 12 and 18. They receive training, are assessed by the game masters and then the betting begins. The games will be televised and are required viewing for the whole nation. In book 1 Peeta and Katniss won the games, but angered many in leadership in the Capitol.<br /><br />Now is the beginning of the preparation for the 75th Hunger Games. It is a Quarter Quell; each 25 years the rules are modified. In previous Quarter Quells, on the 25th Anniversary of the rebellion, each district had to vote on what child to send to the games. In the second Quarter Quell, on the 50th anniversary each district had to send two male and two female tributes to the games and this time it is announced that the Tributes to fight in the games will be drawn from previous victors only.<br /><br />Katniss panics at this news; less than a year ago she had to fight to the death with 23 other youths. Now she must return to the Arena and the death and carnage it will entail, for she is the only female from district 12 to be a victor. And she will have to enter the arena either with Peeta or Haymitch, her former co-winner or her mentor. And this time the Capitol will not allow two winners from a district again. Her world has just been turned upside down. As she prepares to train to re-enter the arena, she must decide who and what she is willing to fight for and this time maybe die for.<br /><br />This book was so intense I could not put it down. I read it in one sitting, devouring it, then went back about a week later and reread it more slowly in case I missed anything. The cliff hanger is so extreme that even though it is more than a year away, I cannot wait for book 3 to be published.

B0024FAR5M|5.0|Whoever's running FX gets a serious nod from me. The Shield, Rescue Me and now Sons Of Anarchy...with both The Soprano's and The Wire from HBO and you have the 5 best shows of the past decade. Now that's putting some serious praise on SOA after only 1 season, but in the hands of both a writer and producer of two of the above mentioned shows, I believe it will only get better. Brilliantly casted, well written and perfectly executed, SOA has everything you would hope for in a series. I would love to see it have a run that the other four have had (and in the case of Rescue Me, still having). One of the great things about the dvd release is that you can watch the entire season as a whole, digesting the story in one fell swoop. I get a different perspective than when I watched it weekly. Viewing 13 episodes in two days again has me jonesing for more...My anticipation of Season 2 on Sept 8 is on par with football season....It's a great time of year!!

B0017SWPXY|5.0|A long time ago, I read \\"Flush\\" by Virginia Woolf.  It was the first book written from the point of view of a dog that I had ever read, and I thought it was truly unique and wonderful.  I just finished \\"The Art of Racing in the Rain,\\" and I am once again amazed by the uniqueness and power of a book written from the point of view of a dog.  Enzo is perhaps one of the most powerful characterizations I have read.  I was thoroughly engrossed by the book.  It made me laugh and it made me cry.  I rarely do either while I'm reading.  I must admit that I am a \\"dog person,\\" so that perhaps affected me greatly while reading this book on a personal level; however, the craftsmanship of the book is what makes this such an amazing read.  I felt so close to the main character and one with him. It takes a great deal of talent on the part of the author to create such a sympathetic character, and to be able to make it so for a dog.  This is not some Disney-esque rendition in which the animal kingdom is anthropomorphized.  It is thoroughly believable.  It is a highly entertaining book.  It reads quickly and is thoroughly engrossing.  The world comes alive from Enzo's point of view, and it is rare that a reader gets to see the world from a dog's so vivid point of view.  This book, therefore, comes highly recommended and rated.

B001DDBCUU|3.0|For years I have been waiting for this. I was so upset at the way the series ended,too many loose ends and everyone else seem to grow up and get a decent ending except Carrie.   I was skeptical that it would let me down by the watering down everything.But it was better than I expected ,but still mad at the way it ended.  The clothes were beautiful (esp the Oscar De La Renta Wedding gown with the red rose headband and that bright blue maid of honor dress Miranda picked out)   Jennifer Hudson also stars as Carrie's new friend and assistant, Louise from St Louis. She brought a lot of depth and variety to this movie with her small part.   Here is a few of my favorite quotes.     FAVORITE QUOTES     How often do you \\"Color\\"? (Miranda to the girls)   \\" I won't tell you how often, but when Big colors he rarely stays in the lines.\\" (Carrie to the girls)   \\"Color? Well I can't color enough. I would color all day...everyday if I had my way I'd use every crayon in the box.\\"(Samantha to the girls)     \\"Honey even if I were in jail, I wouldn't have that....situation\\"     PLOT (each character has their own plot)   Charlotte and Harry - have an adorable adopted daughter from China (who is Carrie's little mini me)and after years of trying Charlotte is pregnant.     Smith & Sam - have moved to Hollywood - Sam is an agent for the stars and Smith is a famous actor now. Samantha should be content , but the Antonio Banderas LOOKALIKE next door makes it really hard.   Miranda & Steve - Miranda has changed the most- all she does is work and is so busy taking care of her son and her mother in law who has dementia ,It has taken a toll on her marriage to Steve.She is much more bitter,insensitive and depressed than she ever was and possibly bit jealous that Carrie is getting married.     Carrie and Big - Carrie has written 3 successful books and is engaged to Big.She is asked by the editor of Vogue to do a wedding spread for Vogue. But Big starts to get cold feet again...     Favorite momentsSamantha laying on her coffee table naked with sushi on her private parts.   Charlotte's reaction to Carrie nonchalantly telling the girls of how Big proposed to her   Steve and Miranda on the bridge.       Bottom line   If you were a fan of the TV series ,you will love the show.It is a great movie to see with your girlfriends.(I wouldn't advise you make your boyfriend see it,the girl next to me at the theater brought her man and he kept complaining about how miserable he was.They ended up having a fight because he kept leaving to get popcorn.)   Two major quibles. Didn't like that Big has still not grown up. He has been screwing with poor Carrie's head for over 10 years and she always takes him back.Carrie deserves to be with a mature guy who makes her feel good about herself,not an self important jerk that can't make up his mind.   Also Charlotte letting her little girl hear the their private conversations. Come on now, any dummy knows their are things you can't talk about in front of three year olds.

B002FQOI0A|5.0|I loved this book. I am older than Miranda's mother but I loved how genuine Miranda seemed as a 12-year-old. Stead does a great job with characterization, and I loved that Miranda solves her own problem but she does have a mother who cares about her.  So many YA and MG books have orphans or kids with bad or absent parents, so it was nice to see one where the mom was neither drunk, nor crazy.<br /><br />The book has a science fiction classic (A WRINKLE IN TIME) as a literary device in the story, and it is, in a more subtle way, a science fiction story itself. I loved it!  I loved the ending and I loved getting to the ending.
0060557818|3.0|I've been looking forward to reading this book for a while, but always found a reason not to pick it up at a bookstore. However, having been recently disappointed by a few book choices, I decided to mollify my mind with a sure thing - Neverwhere.  After reading it though, I can honestly say that this was the oddest tale I have ever read. I liked parts of it, dislikes some parts, but overall I found it peculiar and difficult to evaluate objectively.    The story felt to me like an adult versions of The Harry Potter and The Golden Compass. The main difference being that Harry and Will (I'm picking male characters for comparison) were children and their colorful and frequently perilous adventures complemented their youthful and often naïve personas. Richard, on the other hand, is in his mid twenties, hence to all intents and purposes a man. This is further illustrated by the facts that he has already dealt with the pain of losing both parents and three years ago moved from a small Scottish town to London, where he rents a flat and has a steady job - all traits that can be attributed to what our society dictates is a grown man. However, after you learn more about his personality and examine his interactions with others, confusion sets in. Am I reading about an adolescent boy or a man? Why is Richard such an oblivious pushover? He is scared of everything including but not limited to heights, small spaces, his overbearing fiancé, and most especially being invisible. Interestingly enough, this is the situation he finds himself in after helping a strange young girl, Door. That small act of altruism, which is so atypical by today's norms, throws his world upside down and thrusts him headfirst into a secret world of London's underground.  There he meets friends and enemies and embarks on a dangerous journey which will forever change his life.    Taken as a whole, Richard's big heart is the only redeeming quality in this otherwise unlikeable and wimpy young man. He does growa semblance of a backbone close to the end, but throughout the story I just wanted to shake him and yell \\"Be A Man!\\"  Even though Neil Gaiman's imagination is quite spectacular, I think the book lacked characterization. There is definitely something wrong when the only interesting characters in a story are the villains. Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, and to a lesser degree Marquis de Carabas, were the only vibrant individuals. The rest of the cast I found to be two-dimensional and completely boring. Consequently, the few times Richard doubted his sanity, I found myself hoping that he really is nuts and he'll soon wake up at a psychiatric hospital in a straitjacket.   I enjoyed the clever use of foreshadowing and the overall mystery was well set up and executed, but the author failed to make me care for his protagonists, which is what usually draws me to Fantasy books.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Reviews of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN abound; instead of reviewing, I'm writing to recommend to all those who have been waiting to purchase this film to run - don't walk - to amazon.co.uk to purchase the British release of this amazing film.    The UK has been enjoying a Blu-Ray release of this film that actually assumes a level of intelligence on the part of its audience.  First, the subtitles are the theatrical version.  Second, there isn't even an option for a dubbed audio track - you hear it in Swedish and read subtitles.  Period.  I find this lack of dubbed audio to be amazingly refreshing.    Fortunately, Blu-Ray does not yet suffer from the Region Coding that restrain DVD's.  In addition, unlike DVD there is no PAL/NTSC compatability issue at all - the UK release is fully functional and playable on American equipment.  It does cost more than the American release, but for this film I found the price to be well worth it.    SO - your ticket to a proper release of a truly great film lies just an ocean away...
B000HIVQD0|5.0|Awesome CD, has all the best songs, including, the very hard to find Cuban Slide, excellent packaging with booklet, very happy with CD, I have to keep it under lock and key because everyone wants to borrow it.
B001AQTWF2|2.0|What a disappointment.   Her voice was so pure and now is just gruff.   I thought A Song For You would be beautiful, but it isn't.   She sounds forced and hung over.   I think she ruined her voice by yelling \\"Bobby!\\"  \\"BAAABBY!\\" too much.   Even her airbrushed photo in the album cover looks sad and her eyes show that she is just not into it.   She looks embarrassed.   The ballads are weak and the dance numbers sound cheap.   Couldn't they have made a better album?   Probably not.   She was probably not sober much during the recording process so they had to take what they could get on her hung over days.   Should have waited until she gets a grip - if she ever will.   The low price of $9.99 kinda says it all.
B0029LHW4A|5.0|JET was already my favorite band before Shaka Rock came out, and this album only further solidifies why I love them so much. I cannot find anything bad to say about this album. This is the first CD I've ever bought where I loved each and every song on the disc. K.I.A. and Beat On Repeat pull you in, She's A Genius, Black Hearts (On Fire), Seventeen, La-Di-Da and Goodbye Hollywood kick your ass, Walk and Times Like This shake you up, Let Me Out makes you reflective, and Start The Show gives you one more sucker punch before soothing you with She Holds A Grudge. I wasn't terribly fond of the slow stuff in Get Born, or the darker tones of Shine On, but this is JET full throttle. They grab you from the first track and smack you in the face the entire album. She's A Genius has replaced Rip It Up as my all-time favorite song, something I didn't think possible. Whether you're a hardcore JET fan or just getting to know the guys, BUY THIS ALBUM.

159448385X|5.0|Wow. I loved these women and was fascinated with the history as it progressed through to recent years of life in Afghanistan. It was painful to live Mariam's life with her and at first I thought Laila was going to bring a respite from Rasheed's cruelty. But that isn't what happened. Rasheed is only one bad element. These women also live with one regime after another that has no value for women other than their ability to produce boys.<br /><br />I never understood what was happening in Afghanistan and to the Afghan people, and now I actually care about them. That's what a good book does.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|If you're looking for the old Whitney when you get this CD, then you'll be disappointed.  The range and caliber of her voice has inarguably deteriorated (I'm not going to speculate into all the debatable reasons why, but I'm sure a part of it has to do with age, vocal nodules, etc).  As a result, the songs on this album seemed to have been chosen to fit with Whitney's new, much more limited voice.  You won't find an I Will Always Love You or All the Man I Need song on this album.  That's just not happening.  At first listen, I was a little disappointed with many of the songs.  But that was because I was comparing 40something Whitney to 20something Whitney, and I was expecting more ballads, even though few people nowadays even sing them. But on second listen, taking the album for what it was, not comparing her to who she was, but simply listening to the music, I realized this is an excellent album. So from this point in the review, I'll be talking about the songs on the album itself, not how Whitney of today compares with Whitney of yesteryear.    Of the two slow, ballad-like songs on the album only I Look To You is worth listening to.  Though I love the message in I Didn't Know My Own Strength, it's a pretty mundane ballad and Whitney's voice is nearly monotonous throughout the entire song.  No \\"wow\\" moments in there. It was great for getting her messge out, but I doubt you'll be putting it on repeat.  On the other hand, her vocals in I Look To You are delivered much more soothingly, with much more impassioned vocals.  It's also a very well-written song, R Kelly did a wonderful job on both lyrics and composition.      Most of the other songs pretty much fit with the trend of today's music:  dance/club songs.  Million Dllar Bill straddles the line between good and great.  It may take some getting used to due to the 70s disco beat at the beginning, but when you get into the song it'll definitely have you \\"going left, right, up, down, got you spinning 'round and 'round.\\"     \\"Nothing But love\\"  has a great beat to it, and her vocals are excellent.  You'll definitely be bumping this in the car.  It's motivational, and the lyrics attack all the haters that we know have attacked Whitney. Definiely one of the best songs.  Also at the top of the list:  A Song For You. If only for the note she holds at the end.  The song is one of the few that showcase her vocals.  Maybe Whit decided to go all out because she's been singing it for so long.  Who knows?  But she's hitting some clear, high notes and holding some long vibrato notes.  It's also got a great, fast, disco-type beat about a minute into it.  And seriously, you gotta hear that note she holds at the end.  It's like 20 seconds long.  That's Whit for you.    My favorite song on the album is Call You Tonight.  It's mid-tempo, she seems to do her best work on mid-tempo songs. It has a smooth beat that'll have you swaying back and forth, trying to sing along with Whitney, but failing of course.  It's also cross-generational.  Not with the message of the lyrics, but with the flow of it.  I'm 25 and played this for my married 51-year-old mother who listens to gospel music all the time and she loved it.     My mother did not, however, like some of the lyrics in Salute, which I really enjoyed.  In particular, she had a problem with the line \\"you think your s*** don't stink, but it do.\\"  I'm not sure if it was the incorrect grammar, or the fact that Whitney said it but my mother replied upon hearing it, quote, \\"that doesn't sound right.\\"  I love it though.  I think some of the lyrics are lazy(R.Kelly wrote it) but \\"Queen of the Night\\" Whitney sings it and you can tell she's feeling it. It sounds like a response to both her ex and the media.    There are other gems on this album, including Like I Never Left.  But I heard that when it leaked last year, so it's pretty old to me now.  But if you haven't heard it, it'll definitely be one of your favs.  I could do without Akon singing on it though.      Worth It and For the Lovers are good, not great. For the Lovers sounds like a club dance song and will have you swinging yor hands, so maybe you shouldn't drive and listen to this one, might have an accident.  Worth It is about, well...as Whitney sings \\"somebody's gonna make love to this song tonight.\\"   Great vocals in here too, and you can hear her easily shift from chest voice to head voice, a trait which she's known for.      I don't know how I feel about I Got You.  It's got a smooth Jamaican-type vibe to it.  It's not bad, but she's not really singing in it...just kinda talking and doing a hollow, calling out type thing. You may sway to it, but I'm glad it's at the end of the CD.  I just wish it wasn't before Salute.    Overall, Whitney and Clive did a great job picking songs for this album.  Only a few songs are lacking (as can be expected with any album), but all the great ones make up for it.  The songs also mesh well with Whitney's voice, and brings her into the music industry of today without sacrificing her class.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This movie is awesome. The cast is great and so is the singing. This is one of my favorite movies and soundtracks. It is just an all around great movie. The covers of The Beatles songs is pretty great too.
B000VBJEEG|3.0|This movie is okay but not a family favorite.  I think we should have watched it before we bought it.  I was happy with how quickly we received it and everything else.
B0014VPFTA|5.0|Just warning you: I haven't written any reviews for a while, and I'm not very good at it, but here goes:    Rolling Stone recently (well, in 2007, so not so recently) labeled him as \\"Slowhand, Jr.\\" in reference to Eric Clapton. Maybe it's the timing of when I discovered this album, but I've been listening to a lot of Clapton's stuff as well, and I must say I agree. Mayer is a master of the blues guitar. He produces a crisp, clear sound with every note he plays, regardless of how fast it may be.    Highlights:    \\"Waiting on the world to change\\": politically charged lyrics, great jam, you've probably heard it on the radio.    \\"Belief\\": one of the best guitar songs I've ever heard from any singer. Great harmonies during the chorus.    \\"Heart of life\\": very calm, beautiful lyrics.     \\"I'm gonna find another you\\": OK, so this one was not released as a single, or given any awards. But I think the lyrics are hilarious, and the performance of it is great.    \\"Say\\": only on the newer version of the album. You've undoubtedly heard this on the radio. The lyrics are good, but the chorus is VERY repetitive. The best part about this one is the guitar - I'm usually not a fan of high-pitched guitar playing, but the execution of this one is phenomenal.    One last thing: I had heard a lot about this album (I'd heard a couple songs on the radio), but I had never actually heard it straight through until a few weeks ago when I stumbled across it in the public library. Most of what I'd heard was not positive, but I figured - why not? I checked it out and listened to it, but I wasn't planning on liking this album at all. It grows on you.    Thanks for reading, and I hope you consider looking up this album. I'm definitely glad I did.

B001AQTWF2|5.0|Whitney is back, and though her voice is huskier and she seems unable to hit those higher notes, she still sounds great and her phrasing is as impeccable as ever. Written and produced by an armada of songwriters and producers, \\"I look to you\\" features songs chronicling her past battles, as well as songs of strength and love.<br /><br />There are two power ballads on offer, the R. Kelly penned title track, and the Diane Warren penned \\"I didn't know my own strength\\", both minimal efforts without backing vocals (except a few at the bridge for \\"I look to you\\"), pushing Houston's weathered vocals to the fore and lyrics telling us \\"She wasn't made to break\\". Simple and heartfelt!<br /><br />Opening is the upbeat retro-disco \\"Million dollar bill\\", an Alicia Keys composition which reminds me of some eighties Luther Vandross song. It contains a sample from \\"We're Getting Stronger\\" as performed by Loleatta Holloway, and has a nice \\"Oh o oh o\\" refrain. The Danja-produced synth-heavy \\"Nothin' but love\\" is one of my favourites and is a shout out to her family, teachers (all those that moulded and/or stood by her), and even haters and those who wronged her in the past. \\"Call you tonight\\" is a lilting mid tempo Stargate production, and similar is the Akon produced \\"Like I never left\\" (which also features his vocals).<br /><br />The lone cover is \\"A song for you\\" which starts as a piano ballad before kicking into an upbeat synth heavy club anthem. It also features the most outstanding vocals on the album, sweeping and belting in places (and with a killer long note held at the end). The piano tinkled \\"Worth it\\" reminds me a wee bit of Mary J Blige's \\"Be without you\\", and it is lovely. \\"For the lovers\\" is another upbeat synth-heavy Danja production (with haunting synth strings), and it just screams for club remixes.<br /><br />My absolute favourite song is the awesome guitar festooned \\"I got you\\", an Akon production with heartfelt lyrics co-penned by Houston and a lilting Island feel similar to \\"My love is your love\\". \\"You are the reason, my heart is beating, I am alive\\" she sings. Closing is the stripped piano-sprinkled mid tempo R. Kelly composition \\"Salute\\". A kiss off to her ex hubby? Perhaps, but it could also be a look at her life/career. \\"Don't call it a comeback, no, I've been here for years\\" she sings.<br /><br />This album is a real grower. The first time I listened to it, I admit I was rather underwhelmed and felt the production sounded dated in places, but I have grown to love it a lot. There really wasn't an attempt to make her sound like the current divas of the day, she sounds like vintage Whitney, well somewhat!

B001UV6C4G|3.0|Though I liked the book - enjoyed the story and the manner in which it was told, two things bothered me.<br /><br />One was I felt all the characters (and there were many) wrote their letters in the same \\"voice.\\" There seemed to be little distinction in the letters written by an educated Londoner and a Guernsey Island farmer.<br /><br />The second was the speed of mail service.  A letter written in London arrives in Guernsey (near the coast of France) in a day.  Remember, this is 1946.  Seems a little \\"quick\\" to me since it takes several days to send a letter across the street in 2009.
B000NU2CY4|4.0|EDIT: Paramount has released a new version of this disc with improved video quality.  I am upping my star rating but leave the original review below for historical reference.<br /><br />Just a note for those reading reviews for the Gladiator Blu-ray release.  Amazon's system mixes in all the reviews for previous Gladiator DVD releases, so there are numerous 4 and 5 star ratings showing for this product, but nearly all of those are for old releases on DVD from the past 9 years, which is why there are so many of them.<br /><br />If you want information on this release on Blu-ray, you'll have to read the 1 and 2 star section, which will give you information on this embarrassingly flawed release, which has so much digital processing on an old master from the days of the first DVD release in 2000 that it looks like an upscaled DVD.  And worse, they used dust and scratch removal on that old master that removed visible objects like arrows and spears from the image.  Don't vote for this poor quality product with your dollars: wait until the fix it or announce a replacement plan.
0307266303|5.0|This is one of the few books I've read cover-to-cover in a day or so in a long time.  It's amazing the coincidences that led me to it.  I had hurt my back after running my usual 2-3 miles.  That night I saw Chris McDougall on The Daily Show touting his book and telling his story.  The idea that American shoe makers had sold us a bill of goods instinctively resonated with me.  So I bought the book.    The great thing about this book is not only does it reveal the nature of running injuries, it offers tantalizing glimpses on the true nature of the human species.  As opposed to abstract philosophical tracts and religious tomes, the people Chris reports on in this book get to the real dirt on all of us -- we're runners.  It's how we came to get our food and spread throughout the planet.    The funny thing is, my key takeaway from the book is this:  we now have to run FROM our food rather than run to CATCH our food.  Because modern life's food supply is abysmal, but easy to get sucked into.  If we run, as Chris explains, we naturally gravitate towards better foods that give us energy without over-burdening our digestive systems with dead cow and other bad things.    Cholesterol is a big problem in our family, and I can't stand the statin drugs.  They fatigue me and actually muddle my mind after awhile.  My only hope is running, and running without injury, and improving my diet.  This book has given more than inspiration, it's provided the guidance to do just that.  Thanks, Chris!

B000063DFS|5.0|In 1991 Ozzy Osbourne released \\"No More Tears\\" as he was heading in a new way, this musical direction would be the path he would pursue with his next album \\"Ozzmosis\\" and more recently \\"Down To Earth\\". The hair metal phase is over (even if I thought it wasn't bad) and he's a more serious Ozzy, not trying to be terrifying or doing something to please fans, he pretty much did No More Tears for himself to prove he was still great and could do impressive things. He starts to get more personal such as \\"I Don't Want to Change the World\\", \\"Mamma I'm Coming Home\\" and \\"Don't Blame Me\\". This different approach does not mean he has gone soft or that he \\"sold-out\\", it's just that he evolved into a more mature person as he got to this point he was into his forties. In a way I think it was time for him to change, and I think it was for the better, he didn't do half-hearted stuff anymore, he was into it.<br /><br />Mr.Tinkertrain opens the album with a bang, it's a great starter, the beginning is creepy with the children talking and the music, Ozzy truly sounds like a pedophile on it. It's got great lyrics, it's heavy and it's one the best songs on NMT. I Don't Want To Change The World is a catchy rocker, reflective and edgy. Mamma I'm Coming Home is up next, written mostly by Motorhead's Lemmy; it proves that sometimes the best songs aren't necessarily the ones the artists who perform them wrote.  There's nothing wrong in singing a song you didn't write. It's one of the greatest ballads ever made in my opinion, it's inspiring, touching and it rocks at the same time, truly one of the best things in Ozzy's career. Desire. No More Tears is the haunting title track. It's over 7 minutes but it doesn't drag on, it's an amazing song. The riff, the orchestral breakdown, Ozzy's singing just everything makes the song great. My favourite song of the album is S.I.N.; it's quite simply a monster of a song. Might also be the heaviest song on the whole album. I especially like the \\"who oh ho, who turned off the light? A shadow in the light \\"lyrics, great solo and all, just a terrific song that has to be heard.<br /><br />Hellraiser has a great beginning, slow and then it builds on; it's a catchy song and another great one. Time after Time is another ballad, this one doesn't achieve what \\"Mamma I'm Coming Home\\" does, it's not bad but it's not that good. Zombie Stop is an underrated song, I mean with all the great more known songs, this one is easily forgotten it's not so good but it's not so bad either. AVH's beginning shows Zack's southern appreciation, with its acoustic guitar you think it's going to be a slow song and then it kicks in; it's one of my least favourite songs. Road To Nowhere is a the last ballad, it's much better than Time After Time, it's a good ballad not much to say really. Don't Blame Me is another favourite, it reflects how Ozzy was blamed for the suicide of two kids and how he's a bad influence and this is him replying to that, it was unreleased and there it is, along with the other songs sounding good, makes me wonder it wasn't included on the album. He performed that song often live, so.Party With The Animals is cheesy and is not up to the quality of the rest of the album, it was included as a bonus track, as a bonus it's nice to hear but nothing more, it's clearly filler material.<br /><br />I can safely say this is one of Ozz's best albums. It's one of my favourites. The co-writing with Lemmy and all turned out to be very solid work. No More Tears is a great Ozzy album because its inspired and it's Ozzy sober stopping fooling around and doing the best he can. It remains one of my favourite albums and I still play it often. I like this new direction, sometimes a change is for the better and I think Ozzy has realised this. Most importantly there were no changes made to the albums unlike make of his 80's work. I can see why some say the album is too polished for Ozzy (he used the same producer as Bon Jovi) but it still sounds good to me.  Honestly it deserves the 5 stars, it's just that good it's his best album since \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" who dates back to 1981 ten years before!rves the 5 stars, it's just that good it's his best album since \\"Diary Of A Madman\\" who dates back to 1981 ten years before!

She has no talent, just uses scandal to achieve her goal. She has all the symptoms of a psychopath. All women with psychopathy are promiscuous. They don't have freewill, they are slaves of their disease! And Madonna is clearly one of them.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|Man on a Wire is an excellent documentary, full of suspense, notwithstanding the fact that we know the outcome. It is a detailed behind the scenes look at an important event in American History. The twin towers are the theme of the film and at the end of the story they come alive as never seen before. The events of 9-11 make the film more poignant than ever. There is a sense of triumph because of Philipe's amazing accomplishment juxtaposed against intense sadness knowing the ultimate doom of these towers.

I know there wasn't any music performances in it, but that's the way this film was supposed to be. It is a great story, and if you are from the Woodstock generation, please don't by pass this movie.  It WILL touch your heart. No doubt about it. I loved it and will see it again, and will buy the DVD. If you see it, and you don't like or agree with what I have said in here, well sorry....this is the way I saw it. It makes you realise how screwed up this country is now, and that those days will never be seen again. It's a shame that the youth of today didn't have the opportunity to SEE, Feel and Hear what we as a peace wanting generation Felt Heard and Saw. I was not at Woodstock, but young enough to remeber it as I do personally. I wish to this day that I had known, about it and been able to go to it, but I DO thank God to this day that I was around to see the Beatles come of age in the US, and was still young enough to have the chance to buy the Woodstock album, and closed my eyes as I listened to it and saw myself there, I was a GREAT TIME to be young, and I am greatful that I grew up when I did, and this movie WILL bring it back.

0385341008|3.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is something of a literary phenomenon, and I admit to having delayed reading it because I'm often disappointed by such books. However, after receiving an email from a respected acquaintance telling me how much she enjoyed this epistolary novel I decided, with some trepidation, to jump in. I'm glad I did. While not without its flaws, this is a beguiling book!<br /><br />The central character is Juliet Ashton, a writer looking for an idea for her next book, who receives a letter from a Guernsey Islander named Dawsey Adams. Dawsey has come into possession of a book by Charles Lamb once owned by Ms. Ashton (her name is in written in the flyleaf). Mr. Adams would like to know if Ms. Ashton can recommend any other books by Mr. Lamb for the book club in the title. I had some reservations that a famous British author in 1946 would bother to write back to an unknown chap from Guernsey, still, suspending disbelief, it was at this point I thought I just might like this book. There's nothing a bibliophile such as myself likes more than a book about books, particularly if it's about books I admire, and oh, but I do admire the essays of Charles Lamb.<br /><br />Intrigued by the cheeky name of the reading group mentioned in Mr. Adams' letter, Ms. Ashton writes back, and so begins a correspondence between the book-loving group of Channel Islanders, and Ms. Ashton. (Again - I suspend disbelief -- the set up seemed a tad too modern, to me, but I chose to view it through the lens of Helene Hanff's excellent 84, Charing Cross Road.) As letters arrive from one quirky islander after another, a portrait of the people and their history during the Nazi occupation emerges, including how the name of the society began as an alibi for a forbidden pig roast. Caught abroad after curfew, Elizabeth, one of the diners, tells the German soldiers they were part of a book group who were so engrossed in their discussion they lost track of time. Rather shockingly, it works.<br /><br />Valiant, quick-thinking Elizabeth is, in fact, the heart of the book although, she is never actually appears -- her story becomes the central tension and mystery of the plot. And if some of it felt contrived, even a bit saccharine at times - including the downright saintliness of the German soldier with whom she has an affair, well, it could be overlooked in favor of the overall charm. I felt, in fact, that Elizabeth's story, had it been the entire focus of the book, would have sufficed.<br /><br />TO READ THE REST OF THE REVIEW, PLEASE GO TO:<br />[...]ks.

0446677450|1.0|Very disappointed in this book after it was recommended by 2 friends, or should I say *dreamers*.   I got the audio version free from my local library's eBook service, and I got about 1/2 way through before I had to stop.          Too much of the book is like a motivational speaker's book or speech.    That's helpful for people not used to getting out and doing things, but it can make people take stupid risks.     I know more people financially well-off that went to college and got a decent job than people who play the games.   If you're looking for motivation, there's better authors out there.    The thing about buying properties and such that these people don't mention are the practicals of buying, selling and renting.   They make it sound so easy and it's not on the practical level.    This book reminds me of the times I had to fake an essay question part of a test in grade school.  That is, taking something small and dragging it out.
B001AQTWF2|4.0|Whitney Houston says \\"Don't call it a comeback, I've been here for years.\\"  Well, after seven years of silence, you can't help but notice that this really IS a comeback.  Thus, this is exactly what this album sounds like.  This album is very polished and quite \\"safe\\" sounding.  That's not to say it's bad.  On the contrary, this album is sensational!  One of Houston's aims for this record was to avoid trying to squeeze her into the Top 40, and the result is a contemporary sound where she sounds quite comfortable.  Her voice is in great form, even if it does sound a bit lower and more mature than it did before.    The album starts out with the upbeat \\"Million Dollar Bill\\", which oozes with retro in a groovy and classy way.  The rest of the album isn't quite as upbeat (with the exception of the wonderfully clubby \\"For The Lovers\\" and \\"A Song For You\\"), but it is captivating.  \\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\" easily stands out as the most powerful song on this record.  The title track is your typical power ballad, but you can hear Whitney's strength as she belts it out.    I enjoy this record much more than I did My Love Is Your Love (the last Whitney album I heard).  It's a great album from a wonderful singer!

But its a DVD you just have to have to watch it when ever you feel down and out as it will pick you up.<br />They just dont make great movies like Jimmy's or Bob's.  Dont loss the great movies of the pass.  Know and show your kids and grandkids what clean fun is.<br />Buy them as there will never be any of the great ever again.

B00005JGAB|4.0|This seems to be the album which gets nominated as the first genuine punk album. I won't go into who started punk in this review, as I haven't really checked out enough acts that get called \\"proto-punk\\". In any case, The Ramones did, from what I've read, have a big impact in the UK, where many of what would become the first wave of British punk, came to see them and hang out with them. That's the U.K end of the foundational punk triangle I mentioned in my header. The final side of that punk triangle lies in Australian bands like The Saints and Radio Birdman, who had no first hand contact with The Ramones or that British scene, so can't really be said to have been influenced by either the Ramones' side or British side of the punk scene. In fact, these Australian acts' releases predated most, if not all UK releases from that part of the world.       Basing my following comments on this album from a 2 for 1 release of \\"Ramones/Rocket to Russia\\", I have to say that I do find The Ramones to have that distinctive punk guitar sound, and lyrical themes associated with the American sense of the word \\"punk\\" (i.e. before the British sense came to be universal, with bands like The Sex Pistols). However, by comparison to The Saints' more seminal sounding debut \\"(I'm) Stranded\\", I have to say that The Ramones would have been better served taking The Saints' approach to the guitar sound in the mix. With The Saints, their sound is clean, clear, abrasive and to the fore. With The Ramones, unfortunately, it sounds like Mrs Ramone was in the mixing booth and toned down the punk guitar sound as it was a bit 'noisy' or something. If that is a faithful reproduction of the sound from their original album, then I must say it would be good to have a new remaster where the guitar sound is prominent and abrasive.       Leaving that aside, The Ramones bring a rhythm based approach to their pop punk. Their lyrics concern themes and concerns of the US 'punk'...snapshots of the seedier sideof their city, and their proclivity for taking drugs. There is none of that phoney Philosophy which The Sex Pistols would bring to the table and brand the punk movement...a corporate takeover which excluded bands like The Saints and maybe The Ramones from the new mainstream punk scene.       Ok, to the songs I like on this album...this is my first Ramones studio album...a while back I reviewed their 3cd anthology, which I liked. Without looking at my review of that here, I am guessing that if I have passed over any songs in that review, it is because at the time they didn't stand out so much. Now, I seem to find some of these catchier, I think.         Best songs:      I wanna be your boyfriend - a very sweet, 50's style song...maybe the kind of vibe you'd get from girl-groups. One guitar sounds pretty, whilst the other has that typical punk sound happening. If you like Blondies' lovely \\"In the flesh\\", this song should appeal equally. Or maybe The La's \\"There she goes\\" is another point of comparison for this song. Anyway the lead guitar in this song is pretty and the other Ramones provide backing vocals. It's hard to think any mother wouldn't push her daughter in Joey's direction after listening to him on his best behaviour here! The demo version later on in this cd has more backing singing.    53rd & 3rd - has a catchy chorus and seems to be about a Vietnam War veteran who is an unsuccessful prostitute!         Next best songs:      Blitzkrieg bop - a song which grew on me on second listen. Has a classic guitar sound, is catchy and features some nice beats and noticeable bass. The Clash's \\"I fought the law\\" is brought to mind re vocal melody.    Down on my knees - 50s style rock'n'roll, bassy, with nice backing vocals and hand claps (actually, I think that my 2 for 1 has the wrong song title...\\"Down on my knees\\" did sound suspiciously similar to \\"Judy is a punk\\"...so, wonder if my cd with track listing error is worth more resale?). The demo version of \\"Judy is a punk\\" doesn't have very good sound quality but it does feature a piano at the end.    Let's dance - another 50s style rock'n'roll song, bringing to mind such artists as England's Cliff Richard and Australia's Johnny O'Keefe. I've reviewed compilation albums by both of those acts here...recommended. This song has an organ or keyboard and frequent cool drum fills.         The rest:       Beat on the brat - has some heavy metal-ish fuzzy guitar sounds. In End Of The Century, The Ramones name drop Blue Cheer, which may be a source for this heavy approach to music.    Chainsaw - I think that this is the second song on this album which features Joey putting on the dog, so to speak (i.e. trying on an English type accent when singing, on occasion). A final example of this occurs with \\"I don't care\\", near the end of the album). The intro has the classic punk guitar sound...like angle grinders going to work on metal. My notes suggest that I found this song to function sort of as a theme to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre...a score to a horror movie, in other words.    Now I wanna sniff some glue - bassy, classic punk guitar tone, lead guitar solos featured. Makes me wonder if the title owes a debt to a Stooges' song title.    I don't wanna go down to the basement - a track with good bass guitar lines. Here the bass guitar practically functions as the lead guitar, I think. Has the classic punk guitar sound, but, again, it's a pity that all that goodness is way down in the mix, backgrounded. The next track, \\"Loudmouth\\", sounds sort of similar to this track, too, bass guitar wise and elsewhere.    Havana affair - by this point the bass guitar is sounding samey, but the amped up fuzz guitar bits are nice...in other words, you sometimes get a feel in this song for how it might have sounded if the guitar was foregrounded.    Listen to my heard - bassist seems to be playing punk type riffs, but by notes, not chords. Seems to be a song about love lost.    I don't wanna walk around with you - cool, driving, funky bass...it's really going places. Reminded me of The Red Hot Chili Peppers. Has backing vocals.    Today your love - the lyrics are hard to understand, as usual. Songs discussed below are part of the bonus tracks this cd offers...    I don't care - a good track if you like bass guitar...I'm reminded of the classic \\"Little green bag\\" or, say, The White Stripes \\"7 nation army\\". This is the other track where Joey tries to pull off an English accent but is just hard to understand, ironically.    I can't be - bassy track, with a bit of amped up, grungy sounding guitar...has a CLASSIC punk sounding riff...makes me wonder if it draws on the riff from \\"Chinese rock\\", which The Ramones would record later, and which was recorded by one of the Ramones earlier in his career, with another band (The Heartbreakers, going on memory).    Now I wanna sniff some glue - highly distorted guitar with a prominent lead guitar bit. Has some bass guitar bits which remind me of \\"7 nation army\\".    I don't wanna be learned/I don't wanna be tamed - a bassy, fuzz rock song.    You should never have opened that door - interesting bass, I think, and has sounds similar to a needle jumping on a vinyl record. Has a classic punk lyrical structure, as far as the chorus goes. The lyrics are horror themed...menacing, in other words.    Blitzkrieg bop - the intro sort of sounds mono on this song.         In conclusion, this is a solid punk album. It has excellent sound quality, especially as far as the sound for the bass guitar and vocals go (prominent in the mix). It's a pity that the punk guitar sound is short-changed in this album. Would have liked more of an edge to that, as you get with The Saints' debut album, which preceded any album by a British punk band, I think. I'd give the original album 8/10, but including the bonus tracks, I'd give this particular cd around 85-90/100.       Recommendations:    The Saints: (I'm) Stranded - to me this album seems to have songsthat pre-empt later movements in music like speed and thrash etc. Takes more than one listen to get into though. I rate it a superior album to The Ramones' debut, but it took me more than one listen to come to that view.    Radio Birdman: Radios appear - get described as 'proto-punk', but this Australian band released their debut the same year as The Saints. Has some variety of sound...from \\"Oi!\\" type punk, to more speed based punk, to easy-listening jazzy tracks. Have heard Television's Marquee Moon, which I don't really consider to be punk, despite it being classed as such. If Television were punk, Radio Birdman might be what they would have sounded like. If you like Radio Birdman's jazzy, easy listening tracks, you will be rewarded by a listen to Marquee Moon, although I did not get that much out of them.    The Damned: Damned damned damned - the first English punk band to release an album...a fact which was brought to my attention in a recent issue of \\"Classic rock\\" magazine, by Joey Ramone, in an interview which was finally published, despite being conducted years ago (this interview is in the 'alternative history of heavy metal' issue, of some months back. Joey takes full credit for every first wave of punk band to come out...an assertion I do not agree with, at least as far as the Australian punk scene goes).
B000000WA4|4.0|Any Smashing Pumpkins fan worth their salt has heard of 1995's \\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\".<br /><br />\\"Mellon Collie\\" is the Smashing Pumpkins' 2-disc opus, a combination of all different types of music that can please almost any palette.  Ranging from blistering guitar rock to electronica that verges on techno to soft, sweet piano ballads, this masterpiece features it all.  Genius frontman Billy Corgan has an edgy enough voice that lets him sing the poetic, emotional lyrics that he wants you to hear without feeling like you're listening to a mopey, woe-is-me type of record.<br /><br />Released a year after Kurt Cobain of Nirvana's death, people were relieved and refreshed to hear a new take on the grunge movement without it sounding like a Nirvana copycat.  Nirvana's revolutionary grunge sound was one in which many bands coming out around that time were taking on in an effort to either ride the waves of Nirvana's success, or as a tribute to the late Cobain.  An unfortunate result of that was some pretty lackluster music and an appearance of straight-out paraphrase.  The Smashing Pumpkins had a bit more of that sound in their earlier albums, such as \\"Siamese Dream\\" and particularly on \\"Gish\\", but \\"Mellon Collie\\" broke that mold with a sledgehammer.<br /><br />Below is a brief description and numerical rating of the tracks on \\"Mellon Collie\\".  Even the booklets are entertaining.  One booklet contains some nice photographs of the band and the other booklet has lots of traditional artwork and the lyrics, which is always a helpful plus, especially since sometimes it is hard to understand what Corgan is singing.<br /><br />Disc 1: Dawn to Dusk<br /><br />Track 1: Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness--(6)--a hauntingly beautiful instrumental track to start the album out.  Don't think this is setting the tone for the whole album, though, because you're about to listen to an electic mixture of musical sound.<br /><br />Track 2: Tonight, Tonight--(10)--one of their most stunning songs, (and music videos), to date.  From the music video, bassist D'arcy actually took home some of the set design, she loved it so much.  The song, though, is about hope.  Time has changed you, as it changes all of us, but if you just believe, you can make a difference tonight.  All is possible tonight.<br /><br />Track 3: Jellybelly--(6)--one of the harder, more thrashy songs on the album, this is a complete 360 degree turn from \\"Tonight, Tonight\\".  A song of despair, Corgan is so sick of living that he'd rather just die.<br /><br />Track 4: Zero--(9)--a fantastic rock song with a great guitar riff.  Despite feeling like a complete loser, she makes him feel like he has meaning.  Here we get a sense of Corgan's bitterness towards God and the fakes who lord their materialism over everyone.<br /><br />Track 5: Here is No Why--(7)--a slower tempo of a rock song, Corgan explains the dangers of living in the past, romanticizing the notions of teen dreams.  Don't give in to the temptation or you'll be stuck in dreams.<br /><br />Track 6: Bullet With Butterfly Wings--(9)--You know this great rocker of a song as the \\"world is a vampire/rat in a cage\\" song.  No matter how angry he gets, nothing will change, his hands are tied, he's stuck in a cage.  He's angry at God and he believes that he is not special, not the chosen one, and he cannot be saved.<br /><br />Track 7: To Forgive--(7)--the slowest song on the record thus far, Corgan recounts how he always felt like there was something missing in his life and managed to push it aside, even as a child, but is now recognizing that he has always been apathetic.<br /><br />Track 8: F**k You (An Ode to No One)--another thrashy song but less so than \\"Jellybelly\\", the song basically lives up to its title.  Corgan pushes off any and all love that can be offered to him, and insists on only doing damage to the world around him as it damages him right back.<br /><br />Track 9: Love--(8)--pulsing guitar feedback and drummer Jimmy Chamberlain's steady beats assist Corgan as he sings about how madness and love go hand in hand.  He's going crazy over her but hey, that's love.  It's what you thought you wanted, it's what you thought you needed, so deal with the consequences.<br /><br />Track 10: Cupid de Locke--(6)--angelic-sounding complete with harp chords, Corgan sings about how your world will change upside down with one arrow from Cupid's bow and that we seek out the unseekable and speak the unspeakable in the name of love, faith and compassion.<br /><br />Track 11: Galapagos--(6)--a tender, soft ballad where Corgan sings about giving himself completely over to another person and hopes that if he accepts the pain and change but still somehow falls from grace, that they won't leave him in the end.<br /><br />Track 12: Muzzle--(7)--a more mild rock song where Corgan waxes poetic about the girl who got away. He is appreciative of the blessings he has received in his life but he's still broken over the girl from long ago who he dreamed of a world with and now knows the silence of that world.<br /><br />Track 13: Porcelina of the Vast Oceans--(7)--this song starts off quiet and mild, kicks in with some heavy guitar, and becomes mild again, alternating on and off throughout the song.  This resembles the ocean waves that Corgan is describing in this song as being therapeutic for his soul.  Strong lyric: \\"The steam of my misfortunes has given me the power to be afraid.\\"<br /><br />Track 14: Take Me Down--(6)--guitarist James Iha takes over for this track in both songwriting and singing this light and tender ballad in praise of his loved one.<br /><br />Disc 2:  Twilight to Starlight<br /><br />Track 1: Where Boys Fear to Tread--(8)--strong guitar riffs kick off the initial track to the second disc where Corgan sings about two lovers living life on the edge, going far from home, promising each other that they'll never die and living life, just the two of them.<br /><br />Track 2: Bodies--(8)--another heavily guitar-laden track where love is proven to be suicide and we all feel alone in our pain and hurt from loves gone by but the truth is, we're surrounded by people in just as much pain as we are.<br /><br />Track 3: Thirty Three--(9)--rumored to be about many different things, from suicide to Jesus Christ, this song is a light piano-driven ballad about a man trying to get home and pondering life and love on his walk.  You can make it last forever if you really want to, tomorrow's just an excuse we use.<br /><br />Track 4: In the Arms of Sleep--(8)--a song you can definitely put on if you need to fall asleep, this is a downtempo track and a touching love song.  He'll do anything to keep her here tonight because he needs her a lot more than she needs him.  He understands how hard it is to find a someone and he'll do whatever he can to hang on to her.<br /><br />Track 5: 1979--(10)--a masterpiece in and of itself, this is the quintessential Pumpkins track.  It has been used in many films, from \\"On the Edge\\" to \\"Clerks II\\" and it stands out for its electronic backing track.  Corgan gets nostalgic on this track, remembering events from his past and realizing that as important as these events were in the shaping of his person, we'll all just be dust someday anyway and the memories that are so important to us will die right along with us.<br /><br />Track 6: Tales of a Scorched Earth--(5)--as always, Corgan has some excellent lyrics here but they tend to get lost in the feedback and screaming in this track.  Another song about despair and frustration, this would have possibly done better as a ballad.<br /><br />Track 7: Thru the Eyes of Ruby--(7)--a softer rock song which preaches that love is not always what you see it to be.  Despite knowing the truth of how love is lost and gone, he will still see her as forever and beautiful because he still deeply loves her.<br /><br />Track 8: Stumbleine--(9)--a beautiful ballad complete with disturbing imagery, Corgan references Ruby once again at the end of the song which is about faking it so things and people won't get to you.  No one else in the world matters but the two of them.<br /><br />Track 9: X.Y.U.--(9)--heavy, driving and gritty, Corgan once again paints a picture of a dark world where only he and his love can survive despite the horrors going on around them.<br /><br />Track 10: We Only Come Out at Night--(8)--invoking the harp once again, this vampiric-in-nature track expresses how Corgan and co. can better reach us through the darkness and pain windows into in our own lives.<br /><br />Track 11: Beautiful--(8)--a sweeping slow rock track where Corgan expresses his worship and desire for his love.<br /><br />Track 12: Lily (My One and Only)--(7)--a fun little ditty where Corgan is spying on the object of his affection through her window and singing her praises until the officers take him away.  But at least she waved goodbye, (possibly?).<br /><br />Track 13: By Starlight--(6)--a light fade-in to the song leads to a soft track about Corgan's love for a woman whose eyes he cannot read.  Does she feel the same as him?  Is she just like him?  Will she ever feel and return the love he feels deep within for her?<br /><br />Track 14: Farewell and Goodnight--(7)--a wonderful title for a closing track, Corgan, Iha and D'arcy all take turns singing over a final peaceful track that could very well be directed to the fans.  Thanks for sticking it out with them and for letting them help you through your pain because after all, \\"it's hard luck when no one understands your love.\\"  Sleep tight now, be at peace and be comforted.  The Pumpkins will be there to see you through when no one else understands.re surrounded by people in just as much pain as we are.
