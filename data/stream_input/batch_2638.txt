B00CWY76CC|5.0|very stimulating it keeps you thinking and its very fun. I would reccomend it to anyone looking for a fun activity.
B004HYHANK|3.0|I felt the story dragged at the beginning.  I was waiting for more twists which didn't occur till the end.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|This show is so cool. I can't wait to watch the next episode. I watch it with my husband who never likes to watch tv
B004EPYZP8|5.0|Surprise, surprise, surprise... when you least expect it... that's what makes a great movie.<br /><br />Original story.<br /><br />I've never seen McConaughey act before but this is great acting.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I loved this show - it was awesome.  Sadly they only had 2 season.  Filmed in New Zealand.  Great 1st season.
B004XISI4A|3.0|This feels like a precursor to bigger events.  I enjoyed reading about my favourite characters, but it didn't feel like a whole lot happened.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game, but sometimes I can't put the Kindle down for one minute. I'll never stop playing this game!
0871403633|4.0|Social interaction takes place among small numbers of people. Organized activities in modern societies are based on hurrying all the time to get anything done. Productivity is what has been lacking lately for thinkers like Zizek in [[ASIN:1844673006 The Sublime Object of Ideology (Second Edition)  (The Essential Zizek)]]. Conquest is an area of diminishing returns that were too obvious in history after Hegel. Bruno Bauer nailed the political problem as being too much like official religion. Douglas Moggach wrote the book on [[ASIN:0521819776 The Philosophy and Politics of Bruno Bauer (Modern European Philosophy)]].<br /><br />Humans have many styles of thinking. Science can be an improvement when it can offer sick societies some great health. Thinking of giant leaps that humans have made compared to our insects in thoroughly pismire empires has a feedback loop like Prometheus complaining about Zeus for the Young Hegelians in [[ASIN:157392346X The Young Hegelians]]. Readers who start thinking of dynamics in gene-culture evolution are likely to be the [[ASIN:0848832604 Dreaming of Babylon: A Private Eye Novel 1942]] readers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was suprised as to the challenge of the game.  I wanted to keep playing. I wish it had more levels.  I really liked this game.
B00080Z53O|1.0|The story is veeery sloooow and boring... about a guy who wants somebody to euthanize him.<br /><br />Good for a nap. Don't waste your time.<br /><br />I suggest you spend 2 hours of your life watching some other movie.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Great actors.  The main actors are awesome.  They are in Shawn of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and other movies.  Seth is funny too.  It is basically a what if you meet an alien, but they are a funny stoner type alien that likes to hang out (and does not want to hurt, probe, or experiment on you).  Pretty funny flick.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest. It has so many different topics to explore. It is very easy to navigate. In fact, it is even better now that you are given a prompt that you have already pinned something.
B006M4F67A|3.0|Not my favorite game but, OK, but then again I'm not much for puzzle type games... It does seem to work as designed.
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I have been waiting about 30 mins for nothing, once it gets done downloading it says cannot be installed for my kindle fire HD
B004H83IG4|5.0|Ryan Gosling's portrayal of a suspected murderer who was never charged in the disappearance of his wife is chilling.  Kirsten Dunst plays his wife who never could seem to get it right with him.  This movie is based on one of the most notorious unproven crimes in New York history.  This woman didn't have a chance against this madman who seemed to care about her one minute and turn into the devil the next.  He never had a chance against his ruthless father who cared more about the family business than the family but none the less seemed as shocked as everyone else when his ex daughter in law went missing.  I wasn't familiar with this movie or the story it was about but after watching it I checked out the real people online and read some actual news articles about it.  How this man remains free today is beyond me.  But you watch this movie and draw up your own conclusions.  I'm glad I did.
B0063IH60K|3.0|I guess I am used to a different format for Solitaire, as this one appears a bit clumsy.  It is spread out where it could be compact, and vice versa.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I loved this show - it was awesome.  Sadly they only had 2 season.  Filmed in New Zealand.  Great 2nd season.
B00A2V2OVK|5.0|Come on, it's Star Trek.  Nothing I can say can do this classic justice.  It's refreshing to see a masculine presentation that is lacking in today's television.
B007704HO6|5.0|A true heart rending story which proves there is &#34;pet power&#34;. I have seen the way our cat has brightened up our household. priceless!
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|It was just plain awful.  It's a disgrace to anything that was ever good about Die Hard.  The last one wasn't great, but it was a masterpiece compared to this.
B00005M989|5.0|I was never a huge Prince fan, but I liked some of his music.  Luckily everything I like is on this one CD.  That was reason enough to get it.  It also came with the Audio Rip version which I listened to before the CD arrived.  It's also hard to believe that &#34;1999&#34; is almost 15 years old already!  You can dance to his music, you can work out to his music and you can sing in the car and know every single word to every song on this CD and that's the reason I got it!  I don't have any of his other stuff but I don't need it.  All the good stuff is right here!
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|Love it.  Kids love it. Adults love it. Much better than the old one and better photography  teenage daughter is addicted :)
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|AH!The lucky #13.(M)Black Sabbath has been with me since 1969.The U.S.Navy banned them from being played over speakers in 69'.(DEVIL MUSIC)Overall a decent effort.Ozzie will donate his body to science fiction.If this is the last,they went out with a winner.
B007C12RDS|5.0|Great acting, wonderful characters, fabulous story line.  Lark Rise to Candleford is just a nice story about good people.  So if you tools can tear yourself away from Jersey Shores and Fear Factor, it might be a little medicine for your soul.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I found this book to really grab my interest.  I enjoyed Ann Frank as well. Having never had to go through any tough times like these young people did and how they coped I find interesting.
B009GEYX5E|4.0|I have a 600 series Polaroid camera, and although<br />I haven't opened these packages yet for use in my camera,<br />I expect that they will work as well as, or perhaps a bit better than<br />earlier versions of this film.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Everyone is brilliant in this film--except perhaps the screenwriter. This is a rare great movie with a middling screenplay. The clunkiest aspect of the film relates to Bradley cooper's abrupt transition from manic depressive nut-case, to debonair power-house of maturity. Jennifier Lawrence takes chances which is fascinating to see; perhaps she could have done even more with less.
B00BRUYNBE|4.0|I saw these guys on youtube playing the big guitar. I thought it was neat and i liked the song they played \\"red hands\\" but i didnt expect to like any others. I took a chance and downloaded the entire album and was surprised to like 5 songs right away.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is an excellent depiction of the war today. Chris kyle is an american hero and im deeply saddened to find out he was murdered. Wish he was still alive today so i could meet him and shake his hand.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|its awesome i think u shud have something to do with the coins tho because im building mine up n havr nothing to spend on it
B007HU4FZ2|5.0|This movie gives off a very realistic approach to what happened to Jesus during the last hours of his life. All acting was well done and everything about the movie was great. I wish to see more movies like this regarding the Bible but sadly, the movie industry probably wont allow much more.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|I really liked the description of this product.<br />I plan to use it for instructional purposes<br />in my college-level classes.  I anticipate that the<br />students will find it informative and interesting.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|&#34;Rod the bod&#34; hasn't lost it. It's a very fine cd that All family and friends love. Every one should have this in their Christmas<br />cd collections.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie was very well done, and it brings the characters together perfectly. It's got plenty of action as well as comedy and will not disappoint!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|One of my favourite aspects of this app is how simple and easy it is to use, even though it offers a variety of ways to customize and personalize it. I used the &#34;freebie&#34; version for several months and enjoyed it so much I paid for the full version!
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Awesome performance I recommend it to everyone who wants to play with a great sound and no interruptions when playing
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I am very happy with this app on my Kindle.  I can quickly check the battery life and know when to plug the Kindle in.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I just wanna say I love it it's the best of its kind with the erase and undo/redo  the conflict button. This app is just epicness.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Awesome game onley one or two glichs fun and many cool dragons you can get and fun decerations and its easy to get money (coins).
B007T7MIR0|1.0|This software came pre-installed on my android tablet. It will not open ANY FILES. NADA, No not one. Is it supposed to do something?
0486437507|5.0|Most people don't know, that H.P. Lovecraft & The Cthulhu Mythos were developed off a tradition earlier than the advent of Lovecraft's circle. Writers like Arthur Machen, Lord Dunsany, Algernon Blackwood, & Robert W. Chambers invented themes & atmospheres that would be replicated & embellished upon. The King In Yellow isn't actually one of the stories in this book; almost every story revolves around a book of this title. An accursed book of a play, that if one read all the way through, they would be driven mad & most likely die. The idea of a cursed book is prominent in most Cthulhu Mythos stories; especially the notorious NECRONOMICON.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It's really good, I'd really recommend it to all my friends who read. It was a real easy read and had a great plot.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I haven't tried is yet but it is awesome from what I know of real magic and you get boosters and packs its just awsome
B005FPT51K|5.0|We like it. We connected all of our mobile devices and tablets to this device.  It's easy to set-up, password protected, and provides traditional features of a baby monitor even if you're not watching the video.  For example, if your baby makes noise in the night, your mobile phone or tablet will resonate this sound for you even if the display is turned-off.  The monitor has infrared or low-light video capability that works fine.  You can also talk to your baby, if you connect your own speakers.  The field of view is also adjustable by remote with the slide of your finger.  Works good from my office's wifi network, and from the 4G service from the sidewalk.  I've only connected Apple products to the device, not my computer nor any Android-based device; I'm not sure whether you can do that with this device. For an Apple-product-only device, it's awesome.<br /><br />My overall satisfaction is high as I've purchased other similar products and returned them.  Forcing myself to think of the negatives, it would be nice to have a built-in speaker for the talk-back feature, but this isn't a deal breaker for us.  Also, if you have a limited data plan on your mobile phone, your mobile phone may encounter additional data charges if you're not connected to your wifi network.<br /><br />I recommend this product.<br /><br />As an update, I found the settings to allow me to access this device by Android apps and by my desktop browser.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I purchased the hp printer and was having problems printing frim iphone or kindle. However, found this app and its  Great. Easy printing. Must purchase.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This games is so exciting and keeps you itching for more I can't wait for the next game to come out
B007SOQBCM|4.0|its really good app but sometimes it locks up medioum quality and sometimes crashes but the app is fully funtional
B005HEVBGG|3.0|This show had sooooo much potential.  The premise: a federation ship lost at the other end of the galaxy --- excellent.  The crew: Maquis and Federation staff having to work together to get home --- great.  The possibilities: unimaginable and mind-bending lifeforms to be found on the journey home, unlike anything experienced before --- phenomenal.  Unfortunately, all of this is barely touched upon.  The journey home was like any other TNG exploration mission; there is no sense of despair, loneliness, and anxiety to get back --- stupid.  The crews work together immediately with the Maquis being integrated throughout the ships crew AND taking on the Federation uniforms --- ridiculous.  When they find lifeforms, they are almost ALL humanoids who SPEAK ENGLISH and SHARE SIMILAR cultural nuances, and all referred to by the generic term &#34;ALIEN&#34; --- preposterous!!  (Neelix of ALL people should have been made less &#34;American Human&#34;.)  Where is the uniqueness in this??  (Maybe this happened a lot in TNG and TOS, but we are way beyond that now.)  What should have gracefully evolved over the course of 2-3 seasons (e.g., dire need to get home, Maquis taking on the uniform in later seasons, and finding more humanoids as an indicator of getting closer to home) was done over the course of the pilot and subsequent 2-3 episodes.  Completely rushed for no reason.  (Mind you, I hold DS9 as the pinnacle of Trek; barring the first 2 seasons, it is the best Trek, in my opinion.)  Instead this season is dumbed down, and the only real saving graces were Tuvok and The Doctor, of all people --- the least emotional. Janeway was not bad, but I can definitely accept her as captain and Chakotay would have been better off portraying a person of Mexican heritage instead because the nuances of being a Native American don't really come through this character.  Fortunately, season 2 starts turning this around with creative stories that center more on declining resources on their journey home and it provides more &#34;reasons&#34; for why they find humanoids so far away from Earth.  Here's hoping things get better.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsellas books but this was surprisingly dissapointing. The characters act irrational to the point that its not even humerous, its ...odd and sometimes they're even a bit of a nuisance. Im really very surprised at how much i really disliked this book.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The most redeeming factor is that it allows the player to try to use geometric thought in order to solve the puzzles without forcing math down their gullet.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Fun to get lost in history...however I needed to listen carefully at first to get used to their accents. A must see.
B000U6BT40|3.0|Always interested in new series especially re tech nerdy things. Only watched a few episodes  so still getting into it...ok but is no game of thrones
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Always enjoy listening. His voice is so pleasing. After seeing PBS special I just had to get his new album.
B000AP04L0|5.0|Reminds me way too much of where I work. This is a must see for any person who works at a corporate office.
B008RLTUUA|5.0|Bad Pharma is well-researched and is an excellent piece of writing.<br />I learned how drug companies send their own studies of effectiveness of new drugs to the FDA and how side-effects can be under-reported. Goldacre includes an extensive list of references. I learned about bad regulations and bad drug trials, that these tests may be profoundly flawed. This book points out the importance of doing research on one's prescribed medications.
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Show the time brightly. The weather and alarm functions are easy to use. I may upgrade to the fuller version of this program in time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really enjoy this game!  reminds me of 100 floors but I like this game much better because it's more involved.  I like that you have to figure out multiple steps to get to the next level.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is just as good as the other 2 and I can't wait for the next one. Slyvia Day is one if my favorite authors.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you haven't heard their music you have missed a treat for the ears and heart. Highly recommend. I especially enjoy cello music and these guys do it beautifully.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Just started playing this game and already thinking may be addicted.nice and easy going good game to relax to.enjoying it immensely!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Is this really PBS? I regularly enjoy British shows and this is one of the better. Great job from the coubtry that brought you MISFITS
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  Just the right mix of story line, action, and CGI.  Great fairy tale that comes to life!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is probably the most entertaining game I have played in quite a while, everything about this game is completely perfect!
B000OXHRRC|5.0|This is one of those movies I can water over and over. I always love it. I would have liked to live these lives and had these loves. A grand frolic.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|These guys are wonderful. I first saw them on PBS. I am looking forward to seeing them in person this fall. Their musical sound touches your heart.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|loved it can't wait for the next volume it kept me wanting to keep reading to get to the end and then it still isn't over.
B007GATVYI|5.0|I wish all books were in this format! Great read and easy to follow. Had read the paperback first though
B00CW665VI|4.0|I like the story, but the narrative style is not my favorite. Some time the superficial jokes moves you away from the real issue ... But it's a nicevand fresh story
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I chose to purchase the Kindle version of this book because a very dear friend's middle son died suddenly several months ago.  She was excited by the book and told me &#34;i should read it&#34;, too.  &#34;There IS a heaven!!&#34;.  I had happened to catch a few moments of an interview with the author on TV prior to that time and did not stay with it.  I have my own thoughts about &#34;heaven&#34;, earth, what we &#34;do&#34; and &#34;don't do&#34; as human beings in the world.  In 21st century America we move constantly from one to another &#34;next best thing&#34;. I thought I'd rather continue to think about &#34;heaven&#34; myself than think about whether or not I would believe another person's story.<br /><br />Dr. Eben Alexander addresses, what I learned upon reading, his own as well as my skepticism about near death experiences (NDEs).  But this fact is the least of what I think about having finished the book.  What kept me returning to it, wanting to find out what else he was understanding, who else he was, was the emerging description of several important strands of experience in his own life, both known and unknown to him at the time, and how they existed in spite of his lack of knowledge of them.<br /><br />I woke up to finish this short read within 12 hours of beginning it, finding I couldn't put it down.  Every time I stopped to think about what I had just read, I found myself leaving what I was doing so I could read more.  Like a great adventure story, this telling has suspense, surprise, conflict, and love.<br /><br />I was sorry that the book ended so soon, not because I needed or wanted 'more' but because it was a &#34;whole&#34; and I wanted to keep thinking about it.  GIven that I am writing this review, I guess I do not need to still be &#34;in&#34; the book to do that.  And I think that is because the experiences Dr. Alexander relates - his own 'history', his medical training, his illness/NDE/recovery, and his subsequent thinking and learning, bring each reader along as well, perhaps simultaneously, to his/her own story.  Most importantly for me is, unlike most 'reads', I am left with what seem to be beginnings...........of what ?....  wonder? confidence? deeper love? joy?.  Perhaps many will simply feel relief with what he learned and now shares, which is a significant outcome particularly if it changes lives of doubt and fear to lives of love and confidence. For me?  I feel 'confirmed.'<br /><br />Prior to his illness, Dr. Eben Alexander had it all, education, family, expertise, 'reknown'.  He has chosen to appreciate/understand/explore what &#34;all&#34; is, literally, in 'light' of his NDE. With this book - this revelation and offering - he makes himself, his family, friends, and colleagues vulnerable.  However he is, as we can recognize and he describes, perhaps the one best person to understand and relate what happened to him from both a scientific and personal standpoint.  His life, this story, cannot be easily dismissed. And it is an accessible, good read.<br /><br />I recommend this book, this man's life, as a gift to anyone open to receiving it.  It's not a question of believing it or not, or agreeing with him or not.  It's about the other 98% of our capacity, and our communion as human beings.  It's about awe.  It's about love.
B000I9U9A4|5.0|This is an excellent film from every point of view. It is beautiful  to watch, and a grand story. It is easy to love the characters and maybe learn how to personally become a bit of a better person from their example. This is a story of  overcoming bad situation and exploring a new and better world. There are wonderful relationships, and  even more wonderful creativity to be seen. Nicely done.
B00DC7NNAC|3.0|Very pretty adaptation of oz, but many parts were dragged out. Could have been a great movie but was just okay.
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|While this book is long, it's a well written and thought out book about why some countries thrive and others fail. The authors provide insight on what factors are needed to allow a country and its people to grow and prosper. If you are trying to figure out what country to invest in for the hope of future growth, this book should be the first on your list.
B008ODZEQ0|2.0|I enjoy documentaries and I enjoy food (yes, I very much love sushi), but this one wasn't all that intriguing.  Yes, Jiro is a master, he works hard (obsessed?), and sushi is his life.  But pretty much every biopic portrays a master [insert field] in this manner so there's nothing particularly new about this one.  I'm guessing that a documentary on Alain Ducasse, Thomas Keller or even Bill Gates would play out pretty similarly so I can't really give this one too much credit.  Once you remove all of the scenes of awe and worship, nothing is left to consider.<br /><br />Compare this to James Marsh's \\"Man on Wire\\" (also free for Amazon Prime subscribers) which covers a freakishly successful and obsessive tight rope walker.  In that documentary, we not only are inspired by his obsessions, work ethic, and eccentricities but also saddened at how he ultimately brushes aside his friends and loved ones in favor of fame.<br /><br />I get the strong feeling that I would greatly enjoy eating at Jiro's restaurant many times over.  However, when it comes to his documentary, once is more than enough.
B0089LOG02|5.0|What an absolutely wonderful book!  This is a part of history I never knew about.  How very sad for the children of this time period.  As for the rest of the book, I found the characters engaging from the start.  A very fast read.
B002U3CCBK|4.0|I much prefered the book to the film as I do with most book/films. The story was not particularly plausible but entertaining non the less. A tongue in cheek account of how Governments manipulate to get anything they want at the expense of the proletariat.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|This book shows a more vulnerable side to Pendergast, I think. A bit more human since he has to deal with some difficult situations. He finds out things he is ill equipped to deal with. Looking forward to the next one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|So far it has been entertaining.  It keeps telling me to write a review in order to continue playing so I am.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The actual game is very fun and addictive but the point is inappropriate. The point of the game is to run from the police after breaking the law.if your kid does not know wrong from right don't get this game
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Great Album....You Will Not Be Disappointed IF You Love J.Cole's Music.  I HavE Been Listening To The Cd Everyday Since release date
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|If I had realized what this was, I wouldn't have ordered it.  It was free, but if you aren't going to use it, why take up the space?
1594489505|4.0|Having read this before I read \\"The Kite Runner,\\" I was very impressed. I think \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" was the better book. The characters in both books are three-dimensional, but in \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns,\\" Hosseini seems to hit all the right chords with the actions of the characters. Even in a relationship that is clearly odd by my standards, the characters develop an understandable platonic love for each other. Their relationship develops slowly and realistically. Whereas \\"The Kite Runner\\" seemed to focus more on a country gone mad, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" focuses on two women becoming self-aware.
159448385X|4.0|So far very entertaining and very interesting.Like the character development and time frame of the story.Looking forward to Hosseini's next book.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I enjoyed watching this,  not the greatest, but entertaining.  A few notches below Willy Wonka. (with Johnny Depp), but would recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The book is well written, original, and entertaining.  The story is truly science fiction at its best in that Howey took the classic premise of Plato's Allegory of the Cave and placed it in a plausible future world.  I highly recommend this story to fans of Ray Bradbury or Richard Matheson.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kris Kyle was very open about the exploits of the elite service men serving in Iraq.  His view on his job, his performance as a sniper and his protective personality make for a refreshing look at the war and the role navy seals and other military units contributed.  I especially liked his personal observations on decisions out of his control.  Enjoyed it very much.
B00ASMK7WG|4.0|My six yr old granddaughter had not seen Sleeping Beauty, so I ordered it for her.  Now whenever we do a sleepover, she wants to watch it.<br /><br />I guess it's a hit!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I would recommend this app. its not like others were you just build and nothing happens. ur buildings can catch fire have disease and vehicles break down! its very easy to play they even have hints
B001F4UHFI|5.0|You'll like this movie if you like the following:<br />1) Donnie Darko<br />2) Thankyou for smoking<br />3) Rubber<br />4)State of Play
B00AHQNHSY|1.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD. This player didn't play MP4 files of any resolution, 360, 720, or 1080.  The files played just fine on my iOS and Galaxy Android device. I wish a solid video player was native to the Fire HD. Perhaps an update is on the way... Hint, hint!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once again the Downton series is awesome! Such great character development, costumes and scenery. This has got to be the best series PBS has picked up.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|I love this series and would hightly recommend it.  I have read The White Queen, The Lady of the Rivers and The Red Queen and am now reading The Kingmaker's Daughter, and enjoying it as much as I enjoyed all of the others.  I have kept the Plantaganet family tree handy as I read, so I can understand who the people are.  I can't wait until the BBC/Starz series comes out on CD, I'll probably buy it.  The things these people did to win the English throne are interesting, unbelievable and amazing.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This is the first John Fogerty album I have bought. I have everything by Creedence Clearwater Revival and this was just a \\"must have\\"! I was not disappointed and you won't be either. John has chosen some of the best of his old songs and recorded them with his sons and various other artists - it is utterly brilliant and his voice is still amazing and as distinctive as it always was. Long me he continue to record - I for one will now be looking through his solo back catalogue as well!
B000LB7G00|5.0|When i saw this 3D mouse I just had to have it, and now that i have used it for awhile I wonder how I ever did without one<br />I use it for manipulating my models I build in SolidWorks, doesn't take long to get used to. Works great
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so fun, from the minute I started playing I got hooked. I'm now addicted, I also really like being able to compete against your friends I love beating them!!!
B000VSAEYI|4.0|Great kiddy pool i have a 1 and 1/2 year old that just loved it he was runnin up and down the slide it is very durable.
1563898586|4.0|A great read, much darker than the movie. The invisible man is a rapist, Dr. Jekyll is a whore-monger, etc. Definitely not a book for kids. But a very engaging story, even if it's anti-climactic and a bit short.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I liked how Charlaine Harris ended the series with this book.  The whole series was a fun and easy read.  Sookie is such a little slut, and she doesn't even realize it, it's comical!  The characters are great and the stories are great.  I wouldn't recommend this series for anyone under 18 though.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|There was such a long wait for this book. But I didn't mind waiting because the prior books were so good. I received the book on my Kindle and got to reading. The whole time I was reading I was thinking, &#34;Okay, something big is coming.&#34; All of the way through the book. When I hit 95% I just knew that whatever it was, was going to happen then. I don't want to give away any details but I will say that, whatever I am waiting for, it just didn't happen. I was very let down. All Ms Day did was drag me along to buy another book. I wouldn't mind at all if this book was as explosive as the others but I didn't think it was. It was rather mundane. I love the story line in the series and yes, I will most likely read the next book. But I do have to say that if Ms. Day did actually write this book, it did not compare to the prior two.<br /><br />Would I recommend reading it? Sure, because it will most likely bridge to another book.<br />Was I happy with it? Not so much. I think Ms. Day could have done much better.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Only disappointment is you just get five lives. Otherwise I'd probably play non-stop. Actually, it's likely a good thing; I might never be motivated to do anything else!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|I loved this movie, Django Unchained!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game. It is short with only ten levels but it gets progressively more challenging as you go along. Overall a great game, especially when it's free.
0307887960|3.0|Hard for me to tell, because for me all weight loss programs are frustratingly ineffective.  A plus is that Dr. Dukan's program is markedly simpler than many others and, another good thing, does not rely on the dieter laying out mucho dinero for a large number of strange supplements of minerals, herbs, and the like--just everyday vitamins.  The gist is that the first of the proposed two steps consists of eating nothing but meat.  The idea is that the dieter jump-starts his diet by losing the first pounds quickly--true especially for men.  As for me, I cannot see myself eating nothing BUT meat--no vegetables at all, no fruit, no orange juice in the morning, etc.  This book may be useful for some--roughly, the same which can be said of ANY diet book that comes down the pike.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Great writing, over acting, imaginative design and story lines with well orchestrated overwrought musical scores against the background of optimistic humanistic values in space. Love it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|You hear how girls and women are treated in places like Iran, and Afganistan, but this book sets you right down in the midst of a family and takes you through the life of a young girl to elderly woman.  The book was well written and a very interesting read.  I couldn't put it down.  It was also very educational.  I definitely recommend this book.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Excellent album! Scott, Michael, Parker, Todd & Ed rock! They deserve this. KUDOS, guys! This is the Queensryche album we've all been waiting for...
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|We have ll of Susan's CD's. Hope she has a new  CD  soon.  Great music that we really enjoy, Thanks
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't wait for the next installment  to come out ! Loved every minute of it ! Hope there's a happy ending...
1451695195|4.0|Taking all the visits-to-heaven books, I have to say this one is the most cogent, because the author is a knowledgeable neurologist and as such very familiar with what happens within the brain when one undergoes a deep coma and the stresses as s/he approaches the end of life, because the experience this particular neurologist undergone seems to fly in the face of his scientific knowledge.  As such, the reader--like the author--is left with real questions.  Will this REALLY happen upon my demise???
B0000255CL|4.0|This was the first black metal cd I bought and I still play it once in a while, still have a hard time watching their cheaply produced and corny videos on YOUTUBE and the makeup this band wears is worse than the most over rated band in the world, KISS.<br />At least their music is great, but the panda bear look has got to go. Even KISS abandoned the makeup for a while, Immortal should try this approach themselves.<br />I think the drummer in this band is the greatest drummer in black metal, the blast beats never stop.<br /> This is one of the best albums they ever made.<br />Hail Odin!!!!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved the game it need some upgrades but great we need a shateboard for a hoverboard it would be cool if wen u get on trains u do 3.60's an stuff
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Although soap opera-like, it does draw you in with the character development and I want to know what happens to them in the story. Great scenery and costumes, true to period. Enjoy Maggie Smith's character, trying to hold to the old ways but able to be somewhat flexible.
1582701709|5.0|I am very thankful for the writer because she allowed me to know how much I am blessed in my life. I mean all of us are blessed beyond any imagination.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Obviously, a great writer whose works get better each time you read them.  Depth of characters and their flaws are brought out in terrific prose.
1623360277|5.0|Really like this book and how Dr. MacDougall lays out eating starch for health and happiness. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their Health.
B004HW7JH4|2.0|When Mad Men first came out, I was intrigued and looking forward to the next season.  When I bought this one, I had high hopes also.  I really thought season five was boring and with that said, I am not even interested in seeing season six.  Would not recommend to anyone and am sorry I spent money on it!
034580404X|5.0|Love this series! Can't wait for the fourth book! Got this for someone as a gift and they loved it too!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Still full of suspense but proof that love prevails. An unraveling insight to Gideon and Eva's journey... it's so far from over!!!
0525948023|5.0|I love this writer because he is trying to allow us to escape the control of our minds. We need to enjoy the moment for the moment.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|the directions where too vague...i only found 2 puzzles but then nothing else happened. So I was stuck.... oh well.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day never disappoints! I looked forward to reading number three in this trilogy for a long time. Even put release date in my phone for a reminder.  Looking forward to a continuation on the other characters.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|In Red you get to see the pros making a good movie and obviously having fun doing it. Malkovich, Dreyfuss, Cox, Freeman, Mirren and good old Willis himself--what more could you ask for. I enjoyed this movie immensely. But the greatest part of the movie was the actors and the great chemistry between them combining to make pure entertainment. Silly, hilarious and just plain good fun.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|I love this show and love that all the episodes are all together so I can watch them all over again. Love the box it comes in too.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|From the second you start reading the book it takes you right back to where we left off and it NEVER loses your attention. A constant page turner from page one with an unexpected ending! I LOVE IT! A definite MUST READ!!!!
B0017XD3OY|4.0|Whoever wrote this had a great imagination. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. Great performance by Will Smith.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Well written.  The 'Hansel and Gretel' story line is just a loose framework for this movie.  Obviously not a movie for kids.  Good special effects.  Entertaining story, although you see the story coming.
B00CW665VI|3.0|Story line was a nice change up. Didn't care for main male character personality.  Being in his head kind of annoyed me.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|I thought with Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence, you couldn't go wrong. The movie was very slow-moving with a predictable ending. It  wasn't horrible, but you could do a lot better.
0307346617|5.0|Bought as a Christmas gift and the person loved it. Can't wait to see how the movie compares to the book.
0553386794|2.0|The author writes in a compelling style, but ultimately it is just a soap opera meant to keep you hooked indefinitely (I'm surprised there aren't ads placed every 100 pages or so). It is not an epic or saga that tells an overarching tale. It would be more appropriate to compare this to Sons of Anarchy than to Lord of the Rings. Of course if you like soap operas and you can't wait to get the the next book to find out who's screwing, killing or backstabbing who then this is your read. Who cares where it's going?
B00CW665VI|4.0|I totally loved this book, it was refreshing to read a romance book and fall for the characters and be totally entertained by the funny analogies of the male character. The way he explained the things he thought and felt were hilarious. Made me wish that there was a sequel.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I just dont understand it? Where are the developers trying to go with this? I have this on my Note 10.1 Wifi version only so if im travelling with no internet connection Im out of luck! Seriously thinking of uninstalling and moving to something different.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I'm a huge movie fan, but I've just started watching 3D movies.  The problem with 3D movies, of course, is that 3D is not suitable for every kind of movie; others can be greatly enhanced by it.  My tv requires the active type glasses, so I can't speak for other types of 3D experiences using other types of televisions that use only passive glasses, but I can tell you that The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey has been the best television 3D movie experience I've had so far.  I also own a few other titles such as Avatar, The Avengers and The Life of Pi.  The Hobbit seems as if it was actually filmed with 3D in mind.  There are fun scenes where you have birds and other flying creatures appearing to fly right in your face.  Very cool.  There's a lot of that in The Life of Pi as well, which is also a great movie to watch in 3D.  Avatar, surprisingly, has been the weakest movie of those that I own as far as 3D goes.  While The Hobbit... as a movie is not necessarily the greatest, the 3D aspect of it made it a very entertaining and fun experience.  Highly recommended.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Highly recommended. A great watch. Season 1 is just the beginning of a thrilling ride.Moving on to season 2.Cant wait
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|I watched with a friend... it wasn't my pick but I enjoyed it.  I did seem to want something extra from Anthony Hopkins... I don't think he nailed it, but it was a good effort.  When I stop thinking it is the actor and only see the character than I know they nailed it, but I kept thinking Anthony Hopkins on this one.  In cases like this I wonder it if wouldn't be better to have an unknown actor instead (that would be against the business model I think... Hollywood = business &#62; art).  I enjoyed learning some of the life story of Hitchcock and especially the crucial role of his wife so now when I think Hitchcock I will think of the couple and not just the man.  Post movie, I do find myself recalling parts of the movie as in relation to my own life, so that indicates to me this movie strives to deal with some life relate-able issues and storyline.  If someone asked me if it was worth watching I would say yes if you seem it to be an interesting topic/character/time period.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Loved reading this book. The history woven through the stories of these families was wonderful. Ken Follett is a superb writer. I am looking forward to book two.
B004H1V5RU|2.0|This toy rates a full 5 stars on its &#34;play&#34; value!  Construction is another matter--it deserves a 1 star and I am being generous.  Came with the outer clear shell/globe made with very poor quality plastic and the ball inside was stuck in one of the puzzle areas.  I had to really work it to get it operational since it was  a birthday present.  So instead of returning it, I put it in the freezer for about 45 minutes; shook it really hard and the metal ball bearing came loose. Great toy--shoddy construction!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|There are so many sentences that are worth reading the second and third time. They are so well crafted and meaningful. And the sequencing of the story line is interesting. Sometimes he'll mention something that will happen to a character in the future and then return to the present and the reader now has a god-like anticipation of what will happen that the character doesn't know yet. Other times he'll go from marriage to the mother of three to widowhood in a few pages and yet give the essence of that huge chunk of life.  I am dragging my feet about getting to the end--I only have pages left but I know already I will miss this book in my daily life.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Well, unfortunately, once started I couldn't quit watching The Game of Thrones.  I just finished watching Season Two and am looking forward to being able to purchase Season Three in February, 2014.  The HBO special was so good, I also decided to purchase the Kindle version of the books.  So far, the Kindle version parallels the series quite accurately, further demonstrating how faithful to the books the HBO series is.  Of course, there are some relatively minor changes as would be expected, but so far nothing that dramatic. I'm not normally very much into this kind of fantasy stuff in the first place, but the acting and writing (in both the books and the series) is so outstanding that I haven't been able to simply walk away and forget it.  The only problem I have is that all my favorite characters keep getting killed off and I find myself badly wanting Joffrey's head on a platter along with his creepy evil queen mother.  That means that they are doing a great job of acting.<br /><br />The actual content of the DVD gets a 5 star rating, but I have knocked off a star because of the convoluted menu system used on the DVD.  It is designed so that you can't easily select a given chapter.  That is completely unacceptable in this day and age when a simple chapter selection menu is the norm.  Other than that, the quality of the Blu-Ray DVD is excellent.  There are also several other features of this set, such as a complete guide to Westeros, an anatomy of episode six (\\"A Golden Crown\\"), a 'making of' feature and so forth.<br />Despite the crummy menu system, I would still recommend this set.  Game of Thrones is, in my opinion, one of the best adult Television series ever devised.  However, if you are offended by nudity and/or violence, avoid this series.  This is strictly mature adult material and should be treated as such. Please be advised.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Suspenseful, thrilling, good movie.  Kept my attention.  One of the better ones I've seen for a while.  Probably not for young kids.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Everyone loves Downton Abbey.  I've watched it more than twice and it never gets<br />old.  I love all the characters and it's hard to pick the best.  Watch it and you will become<br />addicted as I have.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is so extremely unique on too many levels to<br />attempt to list. Not only for it's entertainment value, as Mr. Martel displays a most unique and creative imagination, but on an educational level as well. Extremely well researched on a number of topics and an eye opener into a worldview that is quite refreshing. Of the hundreds of books I've read over the decades, this one will come in very near the top of the list. All the emotions are here with love taking the lead role. Love of wonder, sameness<br />as well as differences, love of species like and unlike, and most of all, love of the gift of life. The highest of recommendations.
0062255657|5.0|A lovely, elegant, and wondrous journey. I'd love to get to know the Hempstocks even better. Though it did make me crave crepes.
B00AG297GK|1.0|Not one of Cohen's best works. Difficult to watch, slapstick, not believable. Suffered through it for the sake of guests.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|I have Babel already but had seen a snippet of the Red Rocks show and wanted more. Can't even tell you.... If you are on the fence, don't hesitate, just buy it. Best concert I've seen in ages. Their energy/passion live is great and their performance is terrific. Get it. You won't be disappointed.
B00CATSONE|3.0|Well written but tell me something I did not already know. All that was in this book I learned in grade school science class! price was right! Why pay for something I already knew?
141694737X|5.0|My 18 month old loves finding the animals behind the flaps.  I'm a bit sad they changed the monkey picture from the old version of this book, but still a true gem.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Not sure why this got such bad reviews at the box office but I thought is was a good movie. Lots of action and decent story.
B001KZG99A|4.0|I enjoyed the movie quite a lot, and now have seen them all.<br /><br />Highly recommended by our movie viewing crew.
B000HZGNDG|5.0|Probably the best Stat Trek of them all.  Classic scenes, Shatner at his best, and one heck of a final dogfight.  My favorite by far!
B0059WTMLW|5.0|The free app of the day for June 29, 2013 at the Amazon app store is Sudoku 4ever Plus by 1gravity LLC.<br /><br />This is a sister game to Sudoku 10'000 which was the first ever app I gave the full 5 star rating for.  This app is very similar to that one.  It is loaded with different options and features and puzzles to satisfy a Sudoku player's Sudoku fix for a long time.<br /><br />Since this one also has only a few very minor issues like Sudoku 10'000 had, I am going to give it a 5 star rating which would be the second 5 star rating this month.<br /><br />Only one problem here.  This is a REPEAT app that was previously a free app of the day during late Spring of 2012 (June 9).  This is one of many apps that I have not reviewed yet and I am reviewing it for the first time today.<br /><br />What is going Amazon?  That is twice this month there has been a repeat of a previous free app of the day and they both happen to fall on a Saturday.<br /><br />Does Amazon think that because it is Summertime, that we won't care if we start getting repeats like they do on the Broadcast networks and because they figure a lot of people are traveling on the weekends so they will miss the free app of the day on Saturdays anyways?<br /><br />Since there is nothing significantly new about this app to warrant a 2nd free app of the day appearance, how about a 2nd free app of the day offered for the very first time today, Amazon?
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|this game is so fun I liked it! but the controls are hard and it could use some more time to play.<br />other than that its a great game! ( for kids 10 and up I'd say)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is wonderful! It is fully customizable with a few clicks. If you're in the mood for rain, city sounds, crickets, anything that helps you fall asleep or just relax, get this app, you won't be disappointed!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|We reviewed in our book club.  Everyone gave it a thumbs up!  All the members of the book club think she should write a sequel.
B005HEVBGG|4.0|Good background introduction to a new Star Trek series.  A smooth transdition from earlier Star Trek series.<br /><br />Good/interesting new crew characters.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is my kind of game! I love the graphics and how you have to go to different places to find the next clue.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is the best app ever. 5 classes, multiplayer, FPS, voice chat, it's completely amazing. I love all of it. I just want more games modes besides domination, and Team death match. But besides that it's completely awesome. Get the app. It's worth the 1GB.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|its a great game to play and it makes you think cant stop playing it. its good to play it when on the go
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|not happy with the way it eaned. the next book needs to be ready sooner then later and not in one year.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a fantastic show.  My wife and I love to watch it and we are eagerly awaiting season 4.
B00845MRKE|4.0|I saw this at Best buy but all the copies had smashed boxes and worn corners, I ordered my copy from amazon thinking it would be better..... Nope! Haha it also has worn edges. It sucks but the movies and book/figure are in perfect condition, Don't be surprised if you get one in not the greatest shape. Overall though it's a great set
B00BESM14U|4.0|Happened upon this film and was delighted that I did. The acting was good and the story line quite believable.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|Might be decent for some younger kids although I found it long and drawn out.  Difficult to finish...  Would not recommend.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|This does the job of allowing me to us my bluetooth headset on my Ipod classic at my desk. The catch is if I am walking or the transmitter gets more than about 2 feet from the headset or if it is moveing like it is swinging in my hand then it can loose connection.  It works okay if you are stationary.
B005EGXTEE|2.0|I loved the first book, liked the second book and hated the third book in the trilogy.<br /><br />Stop reading after hunger games.
0679805273|4.0|The book was a high school graduation gift.  I have gift to two other high school graduates.  All graduates were males.  My sons grew up on Dr. Seuss books.  I love them!
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Very good superhero movie with a good balance of dialogue and action. Rare movie that's a good watch for kids and adults.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|In my opinion this was a great sophomore album. It was really better than Sideline story.  He keeps getting better.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I rate five stars both for the quality of the book and in tribute to Mr. Flynn.  Vince Flynn magnificently told the story of the darker side in the continuing battle against those who would rob us of our freedom.  Evil exists in the world and even if Mitch Rapp doesn't truly exist there are in fact those who do battle against it.  The books written by the late Vince Flynn honor them.
B00004W221|2.0|This is one of the most unlikeable characters I have seen in a while.  I could not get past Rudy's tunnel visioned, obsessed desire that resembled untreated mental illness more than an inspirational, talented individual pursuing a noble dream.  There is nothing inspirational here...only narcissistic pipe dreams that overshadow people who actually earn their place in the sun rather than just begging for it.
B0044IABFS|2.0|Not worth the time to watch the show. The first season was fine and each season after got worse and worse.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I was genuinely impressed with book 2 of the Mistborn Trilogy. Packed with exciting twists and action, this thing is a true page-turner. I can't wait to get into book 3 and anything else Sanderson has written that I can get my hands on.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! If you're debating on whether or not to watch it.....WATCH IT! You won't be disappointed.
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Nice come back movie for Arnold, nice action, wasn't just about him. Action packed very enjoyable, unpredictable. Nice fight scene on the bridge
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|There are very few movies I enjoy watching more than once. This is one I could watch over and over.
0553103547|5.0|Once you start, you literally can't put it down. Even if you're not into this genre, it is a must read.
B009G41CG2|4.0|This is a good game!  My only complaint is that it only loads in a wide version, therefore it loads sideways not upright.  But a good game.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This was an amazing movie - one of the best I have seen in a long time. Great for kids and a highly insightful and prophetic message. If applied to the way we do life...  our lives will never be the same!
B000JWTX3Y|2.0|Not worth the money to rent it. It's predictable, cheesy, and doesn't leave you feeling entertained. I would not recommend watching this ever.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|Casting picked the perfect actors to work together on this movie. The entire family was so believable. I laughed, I cried , I clenched my fists and teeth. It gave me everything a true to fact movie should give you. In based on real events movies they always add drama to enhance their movies. This one in particular I doubt they had to add a single untrue event this family had to endure. Two thumbs up and two big toes up as well. I loved it !
B0029EDMEG|5.0|There are very few movies I enjoy watching more than once. This is one I could watch over and over.
B006ZB3V2C|4.0|Sounds good but I haven't had the time to try it yet.  I have trouble turning off my brain at night and thought this would help.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Totally silly waste of a few hours.  Several scenes made me laugh out loud which is a good thing. But it has been done better by others.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|This is one of those movies that is graphic for the sake of being graphic.  It does not add to the story, which might actually be good if the graphic violence was toned down a bit.
B00CWVBV4E|3.0|This movie is basically all of the video game interludes tied into one. My 5 year old son played the game and thought it was really cool to see as a movie.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Have this on my Kindle and my phone and it works great on both.  Fun game to play to pass the time.  Highly recommend.
B005RZB65Q|3.0|If I look at the big picture I gained a valuable insight of understanding what growth mind set is all about. But one has to wade through a large section on baseball coaching until the last chapter which gives a synopsis of the implementation of teaching a growth mind set. Outgrowth undertakes sense and has changed or validated my own beliefs. Carols insight for  m e is that this approach is applicable in all areas of my life. And validates my view that life is 80 % hard work 10% talent and 10% luck... but is that another fixed mind set....
1451627289|5.0|I bought this for my sister who is a reading addict and loves Stephen King books.  She hasn't started it yet and is trying her best to hold off for winter when there aren't so many other things to do around the house.
B001AGXEA6|5.0|Bought thew Blu-Ray version, really enhanced the picture quality, The picture quality is outstanding compared to the dvd edition color is way better.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Look.  The acting isn't as good.  The writing isn't as good.  But if you like sci-fi suspense kinda stuff--this'll fit the bill.  It's fun and the main scientist is a fine actor that really holds it all together.  If you've seen x-files and are jonesing for this kinda thing, give it a whirl.  If you haven't?  Then just go enjoy the first 5 seasons of x-files.
B00884GR0W|4.0|This game meshes some of my saved games together. I still love it. I highly recommend you do not have multiple saved games on this. Other than that this game is great.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I couldn't put it down! Kept me guessing thru the whole game.loved it a lot.
B00CE03UOC|1.0|Unfortunately this keeps shutting my Kindle down, not sure why the glitch.  My husband has a similar game on his Kindle and we played it all the time on a trip we took, it was great.  Not sure about this one, will have to see the difference.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I have Yahoo Mail on my desktop but ended up deleting it from my Kindle, it didn't seem to work as well as what I already had to read my mail.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and her friends, they love it.  BluRay really makes it pop, ultraviolet lets them see ti anytime online.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Even though the whole idea behind this show is completely unrealistic to the point of impossible, I still do enjoy the plots of the episodes and the dialog.  It is pretty ehtertaining watching Mike Ross genious in action.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|This movie was terrible. The trailer made it seem way better than what it really was. I give it two thumbs down!
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|I wanted to share the Peter Pan version that I remember with my grandchildren.  My granddaughter loved it.  I enjoyed watching it again, and visiting &#34;Neverland&#34; again.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|Great game . Have fun rescuing animals and releasing them back to the wild . Collecting money is a bit tricky but you collect it still fun to play
B00CCEHR80|5.0|Although I really loved this cd, it doesn't compare to volume one (3/1/1980).  But if you can afford it,  buy them both, you can never get enough GARCIA. It is also interesting to compare the two as a number of the songs repeat. You can hear the age in Jerry's voice, but his guitar playing was as wonderful as ever, if not more innovative. The band this time had more members, including two female background singers. The cd is excellent quality, and although their are only 2 cds in this volume, I still feel I got my $$$$$$$ worth!!
B0061QD82E|5.0|&#34;Awwww, she's such a little lady!&#34;  This is the sweetest Disney movie and my all-time favorite.  Who could help but love these two?  This wonderful movie shaped for me a strong love of spaniels (and a distrust of Siamese cats and rats) which has lasted a lifetime.  It was made before Disney started forcing PC down our throats.  Blu-ray was beautiful.
B005544TRQ|5.0|The whole premise behind his show is completely impossible, but still very entertaining. Love the interaction between Mike and Harvey. Also enjoy the Rachael Zane eye candy.
B009GED3HS|5.0|I wished that I had watched this show when it premiered or later. I had to play fast catch-up and loved it. Will miss it when it concludes!
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Blue Sky Riders is a new group started by the infamous Kenny Loggins.  Kenny has a voice that has retained its quality and versatility over the years.  He has joined with Georgia and Gary, also songwriters with great talent to form this new trio of talent.<br />I love the songs on this CD, and I love being able to differentiate each singer.<br />I hope to see more CD's from the Blue Sky Riders, with songs that tell a story and touch every heart.
B0075PYG1M|4.0|Great fusion sound!!!<br />A very nice blend of Jazz R&B, and Hip-Hop music that features very talented Jazz, R&B, And Hip-Hop artist.
B009M4KTEM|5.0|If playing in the &#34;Grateful Dead&#34; wasn't enough fun, Jerry Garcia had to form his own band.  One could say Jerry couldn't get enough fun. This cd captures Jerry at his peak before the stroke.  The Jerry Garcia band took many different forms over the years, but this band with, Ozzie Ahlers, John Kahn, and Johnny D'Fonseca was my favorite. Jerry had a strong voice back then, that gave the songs a certain force, that was missing in the second volume (1990). Oh how I miss Jerry.  I have been to &#34;Dead&#34; shows since but, IT'S NOT THE SAME!! And yes, the &#34;Jerry Garcia Band&#34; still tours, with Melvin Seals the driving force, but without Jerry who died Aug. 9, 1995.  So the best I could do is hope for cd's like this to come out.  The quality is excellent and the song list will get you up and dancin'
0061726834|4.0|Although this book was pretty predictable, I did enjoy reading it. It's similar to the Hunger Games in the sense that you have a teenage girl struggling to make decisions and grow up in a corrupt society. It was really interesting to see the workings of a society where love was a disease. I have to say though, if you get into it, keep in mind that the 3rd book has awful reviews and I ended up choosing NOT to read the 3rd one for that reason. Usually I'd prefer to make that decision myself, but I had a hard time even finding 1 good review about it and so many people said that last book ruined the series for them, which I didn't want to happen for me. So overall good book, but the Hunger Games and Divergent are so much better.
0374533571|5.0|Funny, captivating, hard to put down. Was not stop comedy with a good romantic storyline. FAr better than the film, and the film was excellent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was amazing the excitement and the confusing somewhat love triangle and how we understand all of the characters really helped the rating. Cant wait for the next book!  :)
B0090KZDSK|3.0|Compared to the first two books, this one seemed much shorter and slow moving.Maybe it was rushed to get it published due to the popularity of the previous books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Temple run, with a bit of mega run and doodle jump, with something else I have only seen here. I wish I could play it all the time, but sadly I have school.
B00797MB0O|2.0|I just could not get into this movie. The acting was bad. The script bad. I never finished watching. I did try twice but it just never got better so I quit watching. I have better things to do:)
1476719071|4.0|This book is amazing if you enjoy crazy and emotional love stories. I really got into it and had a hard time putting it down. I know some people get annoyed with the whole guy possessive thing, as they did in 50 Shades of Gray, but I personally think it is a lot of fun to read. No matter how mad you get at Travis it's impossible not to love him. The characters are all a lot of fun to get to know and the storyline although predictable at times, was overall really enjoyable to get into.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Fun, addicting. A good so for passing time. A little tedious at times but overall a fun game. I like not having to breed silly dragons.
B0002IQMKM|5.0|This is quirky music and lyrics.  What's not to love? Either you love them or you hate them.  If you hate them, don't let me know.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Purchased the Kindle version of this book. Not only read it, but continue to refer to it almost daily.  Michael Matthews provides a straight forward program to lose fat and gain muscle. I can see and feel results after just a few weeks which is motivation enough to continue. The plan is not easy, but it is possible to follow, even for someone in his 60's.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I have a D2 tablet. Whenever I try to get the game to load, it doesn't work. Hope that helped.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I am having.  o much fun its a fun competitive game by Back Flip studios me and my brother are always competing for the best park its my favorite game its fun for all ages.
0061765236|5.0|Having read almost all of Jodi Piccoult's books, I have to say this one is my absolute favorite. The whole storyline is very captivating and unpredictable as well. With every chapter I read, I wanted more, and I felt sad once I finished it. Although I have enjoyed most of her books, I must say, I've been slightly disappointed they have not lived up to this one. This book is by far the best!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I never imagined that I would get into period drama, but this show is really something special. I would highly recommend.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|My previous boyfriend got me hooked on Dexter.  My current boyfriend doesn't like him.  Hmmmm, what should I do about my boyfriend?  LOL
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I really loved it. Writing is great.<br />Fast pace and fun. Although some cases are not necessary.<br />I really loved and learned the approach they have for any problem they face.<br />It is really a good series. I enjoy watching it. I hope they continue on more seasons.<br />Thank all the people who are making SUITS.<br />Totally recommend.
B000I5XNJC|2.0|I LOVE this movie and it arrived promptly BUT I received a region 2 disk and do not have the equipment to watch it;<br />Ive tried to contact the seller twice through Amazon to return/exchange it for a region 1 copy during my guarantee<br />period to no avail (problems are with my system) and now im stuck but not mad-just bummed.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|I purchased the Kindle edition in March as it was an upcoming group selection in one of my reading groups on Goodreads. The cover really had me swinging back and forth as I'm not really an avid fan of robotic-type stories and I worried it would not be able to keep my interest (I'm challenged by the TV remote, ugh - would robot technology be a challenge as well!). I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised and totally enjoyed this story. Yes, some aspects were predictable - but wouldn't you expect that from the title? In any case, the story was very interesting and kept moving at a pretty good pace. I'm not a huge fan of cliff hanger endings for one very important (to me, at least) reason... if I'm not crazy about the book by the end I'll have to either accept that cliff hanger abandon and the series or purchase the next book. OK, I confess, I immediately purchased the next book! I'm off begin the continuing adventure of this very interesting character. The reviews for the next book are quite promising!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games my kids have me playing. I love it and I highly recommend this game. I give it two thumbs up.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book to read. I wasn't so sure when I first started but ir sentí avive and beyond my expectations as a while series
B000V86OKG|5.0|My previous boyfriend got me hooked on Dexter.  My current boyfriend doesn't like him.  Hmmmm, what should I do about my boyfriend?  LOL
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I didn't love this movie but it was entertaining. It was a sweet movie, but was a bit predictable. Overall worth watching.
1609611543|4.0|I like books that is warning me about certain things. I am currently reading this book. Got it in good condition.
B001XV09UG|2.0|Watched only a few minutes and wasn't thrilled.  If you're looking to see some T&A I guess this is a good option?
B008OM0EDO|3.0|Good entertainment.... silly jokes that keeps you interested.  The most stood out phrase when he asked his wife when learned she was pregnant: &#34;Is it a boy of a-bortion?&#34;
B005LY4B0A|5.0|One of my top three games - the graphics are great, the levels get harder at a good pace, just very well done. Both kids and adults will enjoy
0439023491|5.0|I was very hesitant to start reading these books, knowing there are written for young adults.  But my over fifty friends were right.  This is nothing more than a beautiful love story.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Recently used my ebay account to buy obsolete chainsaw parts found everything used my PayPal had great service and fast shipping. Mobile app is great can now use my kindle. Thanks!
B004GYY714|5.0|I installed rad.io on my Kindle Fire and it wouldn't work no matter what, so I uninstalled it.  I installed TuneIn Radio and it worked beautifully right from the start.  No problems whatsoever.  I highly recommend it.
B009178OQA|5.0|Really interesting history of one of the great sushi restaurants in the world.  You'll be hungry after watching this for sure!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I have only completed the free trial portion.  I have just purchased it,as it seems fun and mini games beyond hidden pictures...  I like to have a variety.  I would recommend trying the demo and proceeding further if you are happy with it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a bit like the first percy Jackson I want all heroes of Olympus books o be like this
0439023513|5.0|I was very hesitant to start this series, knowing it was geared toward young adults.  But my over fifty girlfriend were right - the love story is for all ages.  I am very anxious to see the 2nd movie this fall.
B00BMR4RIG|3.0|This is a good app.but should have live RADAR,also long term FORCAST. Thank you looking forward to IMPROVEMENT s .
B0098XZHSU|1.0|I couldn't get it to work right from the start, so I uninstalled it.  I tried a few suggestions from other reviewers and still no success.  Glad it was free.
B005LAII80|5.0|First saw this movie on On Demand and fell in love with it and the characters!!! Karl Urban makes Judge Dredd such a bad ass... love it!!! Hope they make a sequel!!
B006N0YWGY|4.0|A surprisingly addictive time-waster, but I'd like to see some tweaks. Achievements? (the website says the game has these, but I have yet to see them... and I'm not about to join the Swarm.) Boosts? Other modifiers... new maps? upgradable boat? etc.
B004G0SJU8|1.0|A few folks recommended this movie and I just never had a chance to watch it. Finally watched it on Amazon prime and it just really suck. It's like a really stupid version of Meet Joe Black. Characters are not very developed, storyline ifs very predictable, and there is no realistic romance. Actually there is nothing worth watching. This is suppose to be a romance drama but there is no romance and no drama... highly NOT RECOMMENDED. Don't waste your time like I did. This is one of those movie that ends and leaves you asking the question, \\"is something suppose to happen.\\"
B0015ABRE2|5.0|My previous boyfriend got me hooked on Dexter.  My current boyfriend doesn't like him.  Hmmmmm, what should I do about my boyfriend?  LOL
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Would have liked better if F word had been changed to a more appropriate word having the same connotation.  Turned my spouse away from reading.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|One of the better books that I have read.  Beautifully written and easy to read. I could not put it down.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This season showed further development of the characters in a changing world.  The scars left by the war and the efforts of the Downton team were portrayed masterfully.  This season really cemented it as a must see for me.
B001EDSHVG|5.0|This was a gift for my hubby who wanted to learn to play the banjo. He loved it!! But we both like the movie
B005MLOOJA|4.0|The characters in The Good Wife are multi-dimensional.  Each show in the series makes one think- what is right? Who is good or bad?
B000HZD168|5.0|This is the real trek. Although the original cast didn't get along, you couldn't tell it by the acting. And Ricardo Montalban's performance... unforgettable!!!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I wasn't sure after reading all the reviews, whether I would have issues with this app or maybe it was addressed at this point of time. I have a Kindle Fire HD so I don't know how it works with any other device. Compatibility would have to be tried or information from Amazon to mention it. I clicked on the pdf file on my email, which contained an ebook file and after a few seconds, I got the Adobe Reader prompt letting me know to click on it from the Kindle screen. It was on the Adobe, and I named it, so I could keep that separate from another pdf file on it. This other pdf file was the Adobe instuction pdf file to help someone load files on it from their device's browser or emails. That file explained graphically with arrows and verbage, what needed to be done with the pdf files depending on any placement use of it. I will give this app time, and I do have a Adobe Reader on my PC, so I am somewhat comfortable on the few uses I have done with it. This type of reader is needed with certain circumstances where a pdf file sent to someone or information stored to use at a later point of time. I have my file which made me happy, and I needed some reader to do it for me.
B004RQVVGU|4.0|FIRST LET START BY SAYING THAT I OWN BOTH THE LEGACY EDITION OF MADMAN AND, THE EXPANDED EDITION OF BLIZZARD, I CANNOT TELL YOU UNEQUIVOCALLY IF THEY HAVE BEEN TAMPERED WITH BUT, TONIGHT DOES SEEM TO BE MISSING THE LONG FADE WITH THE EXCEPTIONALLY BLISTERING LEADS BY RHOADS. I WILL NEED TO REFER TO THE VINYL SOURCE TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE. I AM A MUSICIAN AND COLLECTOR NOT AN EXPERT.THEY SOUND PRETTY MUCH RIGHT TO ME HOWEVER, THE OTHER REVIEWS GIVE ME PAUSE, MY BELIEF IS THAT THESE REVIEWS ARE FOR THE 2002 COPIES. THE ONLY THING I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY CAN ALL THE OTHER REVIEWERS NAME THESE TWO MUSICIANS I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IF SARZO AND ALDRIDGE LAID DOWN THE TRACKS ON THE 2002 VERSIONS ? SOME OF THEM ARE SMARTER THAN I AM. THIS WHOLE THING IS A NIGHTMARE FOR OZZY OSBOURNE AND RANDY RHOADS FANS NOT TO TO MENTION POOR BOB AND LEE WHO ARE GETTING THE SHAFT. SHARON OSBOURNE, WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP RUNNING THE WORLD, AND NOT TO WELL I MIGHT ADD. YOU MADAME, ARE RUINING YOUR HUSBANDS LEGACY. WHEN JOHN CAN'T TELL YOU WHO PLAYS ON THIS, HE TAKES HIS VINYL TO RJ, HAS IT PUT ON DISC SO AT LEAST HE KNOWS WHAT THE HELL HE IS LISTENING TO! DOLAN IS THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN TELL ME SOMETHING I WOULD BELIEVE AND, I CAN'T FIND HIM SO, LEE KERSLAKE AND BOB DAISLEY ANYONE WHO HAS ANY INTELLECT IS ON YOUR SIDE IN THIS WHOLE MESS. RANDY SHOULD HAVE LEFT WITH YOU TWO, HE WOULD PROBABLY STILL BE ALIVE TODAY. I THINK YOU HAVE UPSET YOUR FANS OZZY. I WISH IT WERE NOT SO, IT BREAKS MY HEART, BECAUSE YOU KNOW \\"WE LOVE YOU ALL\\" FIND THE VINYL PEOPLE THAT'S ALL I CAN TELL YOU. THEY HAVE ME SO CONFUSED, I REALLY CANT TELL YOU WHAT IS GOING ON WITH THESE CLASSICS. THEY MAY HAVE BEEN LOST TO TIME OR IGNORANCE...  GOOD NIGHT Mrs.CALABASH<br />  (Diary sounds nice but, the Blizzard sounds course to me, does not have the warmth I keep looking for when I put it in. Blizzard had a real soft round enveloping feeling to it, the Bass in particular. this remaster sounds a little course to me I find myself taking it out)g it out)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This Season presented us with an intricate storyline and did a great job of weaving all characters into an epic story f the struggles of two completely different worlds, yetalso illustrated the interaction between the &#34;haves and have nots&#34;.  The shocking finale capped the season, but leaves me thinking that there will be a void next season that will be nearly impossible to reconcile.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This is one of the most incredible amazing movies I've seen.  If you're in the mood for a straightforward action thriller, it is not... thought it has some blood and gore at times.  Yes, this story is complex, but then that's the magic of it.  The movie's multiple time lines tie together some important universal concepts... love, predestination, freewill, religion, etc.  The characters all seem real, and depict recognizable events in history (thought they happen someplace else).  This is one of Tom Hanks' best work.  The level of stardom here is unbelievable.<br /><br />I suppose this movie didn't get the attention it deserved because it asks a lot from the audience.  This a long movie, with many scenarios.  What surprised me is that the suspense at the beginning never gives up... it only builds.  The story unfolds like a rose, revealing more and more truths, but also showing the gruesome realities of the human condition.<br /><br />This is not a story where the bad guys are rounded up and put in jail at the end.  Real life isn't usually like that.  What is shown is that the struggle, the fight, is important.  And that some of us are predestined to fight that fight.  But also that we must always choose.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|A friend recommended this movie to me. I figured it would be another stupid, we ran out of ideas for movies deal. But to my surprise it was a pretty good retelling of a classic fairy tale. Not an earth shattering wow! but worth watching, and I'll be sure to watch again down the road.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun app that will make you think too. When you complete a level you feel awesome. Download this game now
B00785P2QC|4.0|It's good<br />I would recommend it, it's very time consuming. I would definitely recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />God Ghana g high yt? High fruity Farmington ghhf
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|This game embodies the movie, while putting the unique temple run  soon on it. I really like the balloon rides and the different worlds. Look forward to more.
B00C061I3K|5.0|This completely killed everything else that came out this year! I was extremely excited when i got this.listen to it almost everyday.
B0067R0APK|4.0|Beautiful graphics and easy navigation. Stuff I need toward the beginning, stuff I don't (sensationalized weather stories, travel- and sports-related forecasts) at the end, thereby easy to ignore. Pet peeve: daily outlook window offers commentary, such as &quot;It's hotter than you'd like.&quot; How do they know what I like? But overall it's a good app - the ads on the $1 version were getting on my nerves so I got the $3. Can 't tell any difference other than pesky ads are gone.
0345529057|5.0|I got these for my brother and he loves them he has even shared them with some of his friends!  He said they were great reads.
B008Y768XO|5.0|this is one of my favorite movies of all time, 1st time i seen this, am not usually one to weep but this movie got to me...ooo how i love the hachi dogs, their so adorable!!
B0090KZDSK|5.0|Such a turn on when a man worships a woman but not in a soppy way. Gideon is such a strong figure and never looses his manliness. But still he will sacrifice everything for her. Sooo good read!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very addicting puzzle game. Its not too hard but not too easy either. I can hardly wait for the next levels!!
0679805273|1.0|Purchased this for my daughters kindergarten graduation.  Wanted her teacher to write a note in it.  Great price; however, it arrived damaged. Almost like it had gotten wet:/
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is ne of Lee Child's best Reacher novels. Makes you wonder how Virginia will turn out. Definitely 5 stars.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Got stuck at watching my cousins kids. This is what I picked too settle the argument over what should be watched.
B006RA0E5I|5.0|-Battery life is decent, 2 double AA Eneloops gave me enough juice for 3 months of rather heavy use.<br />-The multi-directional scroll wheel is great. You can assign keys to them for ease of use (drivers are on Lenovo's website). The default movements are set as back and forward.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product.
B00B29J0I6|2.0|I played this game after downloading it as the free app of the day.  I played it for about 5 minutes then uninstalled it.  It worked fine, but it was not intriguing enough for me to continue playing.  I found that I just didn't care after the 5 or 6 level.  The graphics were not that great, and the design of the character and levels were lackluster at best.  Kind of like it was a school project.  I like physics puzzle games in general, but this one had me yawning...and uninstalling.
0920668372|5.0|Love this book. Got this for my daughters kindergarten teacher as part of her end of the year gift. She's expecting a boy in November.
B001O2QW9G|5.0|Very life like in every detail, right down to the eyes, it's amazing how they can get so much detail in a object so small, a wonderful addition to my collection!!!
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie watched it 3 times loved the special effects and everything about the movie really loved all the beautiful colors and definitely the charactors
B00CRS88IO|5.0|My Review of The Ian Fleming Files: Operation Armada.<br /><br />This is a novel about the man who invented British super spy James Bond - Ian Fleming. It combines action, international intrigue, and enjoyable characters you'll remember for a long time. It's a fast read, definitely entertaining, and should be a great book to pass the time away in any season. The protagonist is equal parts exciting and endearing and the plot charges along until the very last page.<br /><br />Mr. Stevenson has created a realistic voyage into the world of espionage that you'll want to read again and again. That's something you can't say about a lot of books out there. Take advantage of the sale going on now and add it to your collection.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun And interactive. For people who like or love horses because you can play games and enter competions and can pet it take pics and more!
B00AA8Q0FQ|4.0|Bought this for my daughter for Christmas. She has recently gotten into the monster high dolls and loves watching these movies.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|I gave this cd a 5 star rating.  The Beach Boys are right up there with baseball, hot dogs, apple pie.  When listening to this cd they sound as good as they did way back when.  Love them!
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|....but for Horror buff fans who can set aside small details like that are in for one hell of a ride.  I saw it by myself in an Imax theater and was laughing my ass off!  Yes, the practical effects are damn good and will make you cringe upon viewing.  That's the fun of it people!  Even if it does come out again in October with extra features, grab some friends and loved ones and owe it to yourself to see one of the scariest movies in a while since Insidious and Saw.  At least IMO ;).
B002AWX6UM|5.0|This book is possibly one of the most influential and gripping autobiographies that I have ever read in my young life. The trials and pain that Ishmael was forced to face are traumatic and incomprehensible, and cease to keep me from wondering how he was able to stay alive to tell his story in such detail.
159463176X|5.0|Loved the other books by this author so was interested in his new one.  Yes it was very good but not as good as his second one in my opinion.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|It is a good app to have when you are away from home and in a wifi area.  But when I am home I go to the TV.
0425205061|5.0|Lee Child is an author that keeps the action flowing while creating interesting characters and plot. I'd recommend any of his books for a rainy day.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a never ending game with fun characters and new surprises every day. One day you get a character token then you get jackpot !!!!!!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|This book was very motivational and has put me on a productive path. One of the many important things I took from this book was \\"an idea is TOO big only if you can't think of the next step\\". Keeping that in mind I have started my own company and am currently working to make my idea a reality.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Great movie with excellent acting and script. Definitely would recommend. Was interesting and kept my attention throughout. A must-watch for the summer.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I dont know y it has it on the store cuz it doesn't even work.1.it creates a virus and shuts down!!!2.it doesnt work on kindle fire cuz it dont have a speaker.THIS WAS A WASTE OF MY TIME SO DON'T BUY!!!!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Joss Whedon did a super job writing the script and directing the ensemble cast.  He delivered a super movie of super heroes.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|it's super fun and challenges your brain with little puzzles and you don't even realize it. it's  a great app for all ages you should get it
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I wanted a Bible app for my new smart phone and read the reviews so I tried it and like it very much. I listen to it when I go to bed every night. I have it play even while I sleep! Fall asleep to the Word and wake up to the Word!! Perfect!!
B00D6BQPMM|3.0|It had an interesting story line and decent actors. I felt it wasn't as comical as I was expecting since it was markted towards the comedy-romance genre... not sure what I excepted with zombies though. Comparatively to a movie like Zombieland, this movie fell short. Worth a one time watch, but has absolutely no replay value.<br /><br />Good to rent, bad to buy.
B00942G4UA|5.0|Greedy corporations have taken control of our food chain and are poisoning us because it's more profitable to do so than to maintain more traditional standards of farming and food merchandising. Our only hope seems to be in farmers markets and natural food outlets. Sadly, even with this knowledge I'm still ingesting the poison found on every shelf of the super market.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I first watched the UK version which is good but dated. So far the US version is just as good, and I look forward to the next seasons. Robin Wright has a larger role as Francis' wife, and she is excellent. Spacey doesn't overdo his Southern accent, and can go from good to evil in seconds. I like the direct address in both series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My horse is a fun game for all ages. It lets you experience what's it like to have a horse. WARNING this game is only for hire or pet lovers. So not a waste of time downloading.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Apparently, I have to type eighteen words for this review. Anyway: it's Watchmen. It's great. It gets you really high.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love having the bible app. The only thing I would change is allowing people the option of using the different niv versions. I'm really partial to the niv 84 version and would like to see it return
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Great story, told in good detail with lots of movement.  I cannot wait for the next in the series. Archer is among the best of English storytellers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a fun game makes you think keeps you entertained for hours and its free which is the best part lol
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome!!!! I can close my eyes and see Iron Ignot because I play  this game so much my sis and bro love this game. My mom and dad even play it so all I am saying is that this game is not over priced I think all the money is worth it!  Jazzy out!!!!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|This book took me a little longer to read, maybe because some of my favorite character were missing. I've downloaded the next one, and off to read it now.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great mind game , now just waiting for more levels can't wait. This game makes you really think and solve . This game is addictive and lots of fun.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|I didn't think it was as good as the previous Theodore Boone books.  But it held my interest and John Grisham doesn't write bad books.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Great story. Definitely worth a watch if you haven't read the book. If you have read the books you may be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool. Cause all you have to do is run. It is like temple run,but really different.
B000L53D4O|5.0|As a parent in NYC, my daughter has trouble practicing with her walker in our apt because she hits a wall or furniture every 3 steps. That's why i love this walker. I can fold it flat with ease, latch it on to my stroller and every weekend morning, we go to the turf-soccer field next to my apt and my daughter practices with her walker to her heart content. The laughter I hear as she enjoys her freedom is absolutely magical.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I really love this show! It's so enjoyable. So much to learn from back then. Wonderful!!!! Wonderful!!! I am looking forward to next season!
159463176X|5.0|Great Author ! Read his other 2 Books and this one is another winner! Story gets you involved from the first page.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I think Mathew should not have been Killed off!  people today need good things to happen and not bad all the time.<br />The Crawley family had enough drama without Mathew dying too!!!
B004ADH1RI|1.0|better for audiences age 7-10.  Agonizing for any adult to sit through.  Be prepared to groan and roll your eyes a lot,  maybe bring a barf bag too!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Better than I thought an ending could be.  Series never disappointed even at the end.  Almost temper to go back to the beginning to see hoe the story started again.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Holy crap this is amazing!!! I have been searching for this for a long time. Definitely worth $9.99 to open all the decks. The only downside is the lack of sleep I get now. Lol!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Can't wait for Season 4.  This has been an outstanding series with good actors all-around!  I didn't like the ending because this family has suffered enough already. Intriguing storyline!.

B006N0YWGY|4.0|Loads up quickly and runs really well on my S3. Each race is short - generally less than 60 seconds, making it a good game for short periods.<br /><br />The Hillbilly veneer is a little thick. They could dial it back and not lose anything.<br /><br />The strangest thing is the scoring. You get money for racing quickly, and you find some along each course. You can buy goods at each stop, and sell them later to boost your money. But the prices at each stop are seemingly random, and change each time, so there's no real strategy. Plus, there's nothing useful to spend the money on; it's just for score keeping. You can't improve your boat or anything.<br /><br />If they added a way to improve your boat, I'd probably give this 5 stars.<br />[Edited to fix a couple of autocorrect-related misspellings.]
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free is a very fun game. I love it because it is like a puzzle. Overall,it is super duper fun!
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Gasland directed by Josh Fox with Matthew Sanchez is an iconic documentary that stands as a warning to Americans everywhere. The film chronicles Fox's journey attempting to understand whether or not he should take the offer of $100,000.00 to lease his land to a company which wanted to use it to extract the gas and then send it along pipelines to homes who are converting to gas which is cheaper than oil. His land is in a watershed...beautiful and green. It is on top of the Marcellus Shale which has lots of methane gas underneath it if you can only get it out easily and quickly. Sounds great, right? If he leased his land, he would be helping to get off our dependence on oil by allowing drilling for gas. Great. Where do I sign; I'm helping rid us of CO2 emissions. Yeah. But he wasn't sure....and the companies weren't being up front about environmental impact. Hmmm.<br /><br />And because they weren't up front, he wasn't sure about this drilling process for gas, what it entailed and how it would impact the streams on his land and the environment. So, because he had the time (which many of us do not) he went on an exploratory journey to see what happened to others who leased their land to the companies to drill for gas.  What he discovered was horrifying. First, gas companies are not responsible for their actions after they drill. The EPA doesn't even make an attempt to regulate them because former Vice president Dick Cheney (a star in the film) lobbied his buddies when he was at Halliburton to suspend the Safe Water Drinking Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water act, all of it. So this gas drilling business is completely unregulated and they are not responsible if you allow them on your land and they destroy it to extract the gas.<br /><br />Fox finds this out when he talks to people who let companies lease their land and found out they had no clean water to drink or shower in as a result of the drilling. It went like this. Before companies drilled-they drank the clean water and bathed and cooked, etc. and were fine. After the companies came in-goodbye to clean, clear water; goodbye to health, goodbye to the good life. This happened to many families who had well water. Problem is, they are far from any water supply so they had to pay for water to be brought in. The companies refused to admit the water was completely toxic, nor did they deign to drink the water to taste how bad it was. The EPA can't even go in and test the water since there is a patent on the chemicals they use to drill ; the chemicals are proprietary and that means they're a secret and not to be disclosed because the Chinese could get a hold of it and put them out of business. That's how they don't have to say these dangerous chemicals are being co-mingled with water. And the EPA of various states have been bought off or lobbied to be useless.<br /><br />On and on, story after story Fox discovers the impact of fracking (drilling through shale to get at the gas).its effects on the people's water and air (methane and other chemicals coming off the condenser tanes is invisible, but it leaks and goes into the air polluting the air. So water polluted, smell in the air rotten...for some it was so bad, no one would buy their homes...the water was polluted, the methane migrated and leaked into the house. Some were afraid their houses would explode. They were bought out by companies (not at market value) but were forced to sign a non disclosure agreement....they couldn't speak about the hazards. The government did nothing. They had to litigate themselves...to an expensive cost. Either that or stay in the house and be sick and die or explode. The companies are listed in the film, also. The people were not told any of this when they leased.<br /><br />Josh Fox gets the interviews with the people on camera; the companies never return his calls. He gets pictures of what these folks' tap water looks like; and in many instances, creek water, or tap water has so many flammables, the water ignites into flames. So if you drink the water you die. He gets scientists to discuss the fracking process...it uses water and toxic chemicals that are sent deep into the shale and leak into the ground; of course, they leak out. Once the water supply is contaminated there is no way to purify it; it is gone for good....no reverse osmosis filtering works...no boiling works. The composition of the water has been altered forever; and then of course, the toxic waste water dumps created near the streams (you need water to frack and dump the waste)  migrate and destroy the streams.<br /><br />Fox decided since he lives in the Delaware River basin and on the border of NY where the watersheds are still pure, he would not lease his land to destroy his land, his water supply AND OURS. (New Yorkers)  But the gas companies are relentless, as are the congressmen who support them. Fox is one person...  The film indicates we should not sit back and lease to liars because THERE IS NO SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, CLEAR WATER ACT OR CLEAN AIR ACT where these companies are concerned. They can do what they want. If you don't have drinkable water, you never had drinkable water. Prove it. Take them to court to the tune of millions....over years and meanwhile, they continue to drill, continue to pollute while your bank account is drained...they make money and no one stops them, least of all you, you worm. You drink the water and die? All the better for them. You speak out? You are an eco terrorist, a tree hugger...they malign you. Check out their PR campaigns. They are the heroes and Josh Fox who created the film is a)insane, b)an eco-terrorist c)a bum d)a liar e)a tree hugger f)a fanatic g)stopping progress (on and on). What he has done is tell the truth in this film. He stands in the way of their profits (they will still make money if they have great lawyers and people bring lawsuits...that takes years, meanwhile they take the gas and pollute...your land is devalued and they have to pay very little for it in the end ha, ha, ha, ha) All this has been worked out and Cheney has made millions over this as have others. Figure it out, dummy.<br /><br />Gasland indicates why people are buying into water companies and why water is becoming a precious commodity which will be sold (it may be already) on the Chicago exchange. $$$$  Surely, these gas companies are probably buying into the water companies...that would be smart. By the way, the CO2 carbon emissions...are much less than the methane emissions caused by fracking and the gas industries processing...much, much worse, in fact. We should have stuck to coal. Our current president is clueless...but he is a part of the elites which transcend political party....in fact there are no political parties as you think they exist.<br /><br />The film Gasland reveals the nature of the issue; it shows that the fate of our water supply in our hands. I have gone to the screening of Gasland II ahead of its release on HBO July 8th at 9:00 pm (ET/PT) Fracking is in 34 states and 32 countries. Where are they going to get the clean water from if they pollute the fresh water supply? And make no mistake, as you will see in Gasland II, it is an inevitably, unless the regulations that have been put in place and the Safe Water Drinking Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act are no longer suspended for the gas drilling companies: Encanna, Cabot and all the others., the water ignites into flames.

The new characters and hoverboards in the shop always gives you a new goal along with the Mission Sets. Since I have gotten the app, Subway Surfers has been to Rome, Sydney, Tokyo, Miami, and Paris. I highly recommend this game. :)

My grandson was so excited to receive it and put it together and has it on display.  Great Lego quality and it was shipped quickly.

1781162646|5.0|I love the way King writes. This story has some of the flavor of his short stories Stand by Me and Silver Bullet.<br />He knows people well. A great yarn and mystery with a touch of sentimentality. I cried at the end. Good read!
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Oddly, I found the humor in here to be the best part.  Even though I only gave it three stars, I would see the sequel...

B008LXZFH6|1.0|And that is being unkind to the junk. Will Ferrell is not usually one of my favorite actors, but my family saw this on Prime Video and wanted to watch it. One and all regretted it long before this movie has wound its torturous way past pathetic gags and tryly offensive gags that fell flat as comedy.<br /><br />Avoid this at all costs.
B00005JKGK|5.0|I glad I was able to find this movie on DVD, always wanted it in my collection.<br />The DVD was brand new and was received in a timely manner.<br /><br />Thank you!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Love this game, you will get hooked on it and enjoy playing it against friends and family members. Download and compete.
0062255657|1.0|Before reading this, I would have professed to be a very big Neil Gaiman fan - I loved Neverwhere, Anansi Boys and The Graveyard Book.  However, as far as this book goes, I have to agree with another reviewer who suggested the 5* reviews are written by Neil Gaiman's PR folks.  The best thing I can say about this book is that it is soporific.  I'm giving up trying to finish it because I can't stay awake long enough.  Truly a huge disappointment to me.<br /><br />Mr. Gaiman, please wise up and don't waste your talent and your fans' time with self-indulgent tripe like this.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great period piece that follows history and provides insight to the lives of a royal sub-society.  I am looking forward to season 4.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I always wanted this movie in my collection and was thrilled to see it for sale on your website.<br />Brand new and priced right, we received it in a timely manner as well.<br /><br />Thanks a lot!
B000VMBXNA|3.0|This book is OK.....I read it in a few hours as it is more like a short story with a very clever ending.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was an entertaining read, and at the same time inspired religious, moral, and scientific thought. I found it to be extremely enjoyable.
B009AMANBA|5.0|the period piece done well, loved the character, the politics, and the drama from Mrs. Lincoln.<br />enjoyed costumes and loved the very end the best.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|First it took a long time to download and then it would have to download every time which also took a long time.
0800177975|4.0|Despite getting nominated for raspberry. This movie is still worth watching it has an awesome soundtrack in my opinion. It is funny if you like Arnold Schwazznegger movies.
B000FBJG04|5.0|Watched the series first, the book expands on the amazing story of the series and gives all the extra details. Incredible; I think it should be a required school read.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I love cartoon characters that have a mission to aid everyone. this fulfilled that easily. done very well. loved it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game to pass time. Difficulty level is good. Not too hard. Looking forward to more games. My daughter enjoys helping to play.
B000FZETIO|3.0|This movie is your typical lame 80s comedy. Another John Hughes movie but there are better ones in my opinion. I would get this for the soundtrack that is why I gave it 3 stars and it is good for a family movie. It is good for as a piece of pop culture in the 1980s.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very smooth, simple, relaxing, and addictive game. I think overall nothing should be changed. I reccomend this game to anyone of all ages. It is really a well made game.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I wasn't expecting to enjoy the book as much as I did. Chapters were well paced out, and the author went through great length in research. While making the point, it was more of a realization rather than a preaching.<br />I resumed running while reading it.
B00CFA225Y|5.0|loving the 3d PERIOD but this movie was great and my only concern i cant let my daughter watch it. but awesome movie and i highly recommend to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just hard enough to be challenging, just easy enough to avoid frustration.  The only problem is that there are only 10 floors to solve.  Hopefully more will be forthcoming soon.  If you note the link in the game to their website, you'll find that they have another application in the same puzzle solving style.  I plan to purchase it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I love sci-fi and fantasy books first off.  Hugh's effort here was great and I had a hard time putting my kindle down.  With so many post-apocalyptic books out there it can be hard to come up with something new, which this book does.  The characters are strong and the protagonist is someone we can all identify with.  I'm looking forward to reading more of Hugh's work.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|This was a great movie to watch. It had a nice message and the characters in it were very interesting.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|all his movies are great. but this one is better than the last one. i highly recommend this one. plenty of action trust me!!!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|I only wish she would have spent more time on Thor's discovery of his powers. Yes, I was disappointed in King 's reaction, but overall, I liked the plot. Starts out local, with disputes between clans, then hints at outside enemies and forces.<br /><br />Kept me drawn in with the combination of court intrigue and life as a Silver. As well as the introduction of th ring and the wild lands. Yes, it is a fast paced book, and fun to read. I've already have copies of next 2 books to read. Looking forward to continuation
B00AU15HPC|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this effort from Justin.  Not that I thought I'd be disapointed, but it really surpassed my expectations.  Justin's voice sounds great and several of the songs are quite catchy.  If you're a long time Moody Blues fan I think you'll really enjoy this.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this book, as I have all of his. I do think it was a little slow at first until I realized that he was setting the characters up. Recommend it highly
B007X4ECMI|5.0|still good after i seen it. most parts a bit far out there but i enjoyed the movie. thank you and i recommend this movie. lots of action.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I hate when a game wants you to give a review to progress.  I haven't played enough to form a real opinion.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This was my first introduction to Lee Child and Jack Reacher. It had very good dialogue and interesting characters. As a wife of an Army officer, I didn't connect with the vigilante style of Army Major Jack Reacher.  Too far fetched for me to buy into. But the others in my book club liked it.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|This one of the best children's movies of our time. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone that has not watch it yet.
B0062P3392|5.0|great movie to add to my collection and anything with jason statham is good. so awesome and i recommend to anyone.
B008602KQI|3.0|The movie is a let down. The book was so much better.But they have done a fair job. It could be so much better
1490313370|3.0|The premise for the book is to choose your own destiny and break free from the goals and ideals that are placed upon us by parents, teachers, colleagues, and society at large. The author challenges a lot of commonly accepted ideas and challenges the reader to pursue passions and become entrepreneurs rather than simply being an employee.<br /><br />If you've ever read Altucher's blog, you've probably already read most of these ideas before.<br />Unlike another reviewer, I found this to be better written than the blog, though I think he tries too hard at times when he chooses to write things like \\"Your boss hates you.\\"
0802473156|5.0|I read this book, since it was recommended in a group I had been attending.  Out of my own curiosity, I read this book and I was amazed how well I now understand my own struggles with relationships.  Once I knew what my own Love Languages were (I'm bilingual) ... my whole world turned around.  I was able to identify the Love Languages of my girls ... what a difference parenting is now ... I highly recommend everyone know what their Love Language is, as well as, the Love Language of those in their lives.  Very beneficial for our own happiness!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for concentration. Wish there were cheats for when you were stuck. But over all good game.. my kids could play it for hours
B0061PEAUY|5.0|What is there to say negative about any of the Kathy Reichs books?  It is truly impossible not to like them all, and I have read them all!  I may even keep this one on my Kindle and let my husband read it, as he enjoys Tempy as much as I do.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I discovered the show a couple seasons late so I caught up from the beginning and was surprised to see I was counting down the days until season 3 was available through Prime. Everything about it was wonderful & I cant wait for season 4. I just LOVE this show!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game about I it is fun and I like horses ally I think they are very pretty
B00BHMEOP2|3.0|I learned some things about the Iran hostage crisis that I didn't know; I'm not sure I knew at the time what it was even about.  The movie is based on the true story of how the CIA's &#34;master of disguise&#34; Tony Mendez was able to get a few Americans out of Iran in pretty creative way.  It made me want to read Tony Mendez's books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The best show I've seen in years. It shows the human side of the very rich and the life of the servants very well.

B000FCK65W|5.0|I love reading this book every 5-10 years. Beautifully written, fabulous story. Strongly recommend .  I will always remember the first time I read it as a young girl!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|excellent.  I want more levels though. more puzzles will be amazing.  maybe some levels to reward the player or some topic specific
B002KLOPF8|5.0|I love this movie since the day I first watched it. Great action movie. Covers parts of some friends who go into combat and get separated and some meet again later at another attack. Most definitely enjoyable.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|It didn't end!! Very frustrating! Even if there is another book to come...end all the loose ends! It was so similar to fifty shades.Plus the same story as the first two books in this set. Don't waste your time.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I found Gone Girl a while back and was convinced no book could compete, and then I read Dark Places. Started a little slow for my taste but then I could not put it down. I just loved this book. I loved it because the whole book I was trying to solve the mystery and then getting blindsided by new facts. Just a great read.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not a  fan of 1st person, present tense.  Interesting subject matter, but am not into inflicting pain.  Will, however, continue with the remaining books to see how all this plays out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like this game. I just started playing, but I like it so far. I really love a good challenge. Just when it seems like I'm not going to get it, I just seem to sprang into action and solve the problem.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|Terrible app. One star only because it won't let it be zero. Constantly force closes and will not run in airplane mode.

B003MUOUI8|5.0|This film got a good but not resounding reception when it first came out.  It seemed to fall in the middle between being about Mandela and being a sports film, and not fully satisfying expectations in either direction.  To go back and see it now, at a time when Mandela is near death, is a quite different experience.  Freeman makes a great Mandela, and the film captures his concern with reconciliation and forgiveness.  And for those of us who understand the game of Rugby, Damon's depiction of the South African team captain, Francois Pienaar, is also deeply moving and takes this film way beyond something like &#34;Remember the Titans.&#34;  This is definitely time to revisit &#34;Invictus&#34;!

B00CAZOHDO|4.0|Ryan Merchant and Sebu Simonian, as Capital Cities, have decided that the best music ever made was done by all those synth-pop duos and bands that jumped out of the early eighties to create massively hooky singles with just a couple of keyboards and maybe a few added guests on the side. When they get it right, as they do on the earworm single \\"Safe and Sound,\\" they rival the best of them. \\"In A Tidal Wave Of Mystery\\" works hard to maintain that level of infectiousness, and succeeds more often than not.<br /><br />The bulk of \\"Mystery\\" bubbles with hooky synth-lines and danceable beats, while having a go at sunshine grooves. When a song about valuing your stereo more than your furniture winds into the disc (\\"I Sold My Bed But Not My Stereo\\" - what a great title), you get that Capital Cities are more into having fun than trying to say anything of import. Their one big experiment, \\"Farrah Fawcett Hair,\\" playfully interjects samples from National Public Radio, a couple of verses via Andre 3000, and then drops a dubstep break in the middle. There's no denying the happy vibe of \\"Love Away\\" or \\"Patience Gets Us Nowhere Fast\\" as well.<br /><br />I guess this is the current vogue as, even as I think of early Depeche Mide, OMD or Naked Eyes while listening to \\"In A Tidal Wave of Mystery,\\" I also can't help but be reminded of more recent offerings from Phoenix, Passion Pit or the debut from MGMT. With those kind of comparisons in mind, \\"In A Tidal Wave of Mystery\\" is hardly mysterious at all. It's an enjoyable debut CD, with hopes that Merchant and Simonian can keep the good vibrations coming on future efforts.

B006T3RM08|4.0|I have all apple products and I like my desk extremely clean.  This is a good product to keep the two pieces together.  It's not all that necessary, but looks really good and easy to transport if you need it for that.  I wouldve given it 5 stars, but I bought two of these, the first one I can't actually click the trackpad.  I thought this was normal and used it like that for about 6 months and then bought another one from hand (mainly because I loved how it looked and got used to not being able to click), after the 2nd one came in I noticed I could click the trackpad with it.  Therefore it gets 4 stars since it's about 50% defective.  Still a good product either way to me.

B00821OX98|4.0|It's always challenging to find shows for the whole family - stuff that appeals to girls and boys, teens and preteens and adults alike. This show seems to strike the right balance. There is enough action, story line and character development to hold everyone's interest. We have a 12 yr old and two 14 yr olds, both boys and girls and they all so far enjoy the show.

B00CATSONE|5.0|I wasn't really familiar with Tesla's inventions and life. Found the presentation of his achievements brief and yet detailed enough to get one fascinated about the scientist and his huge contribution to the world's industrial revolution. Above all, the author made a good example of how one can be successful by pursuing one's imagination.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I enjoyed playing this game over and over.  Challenging and fun. This game made a long road trip much more enjoyable.
B004EF65QA|4.0|I enjoyed it, but I wouldn't rate it as one of the best series I've ever seen.  Though I wanted to watch each episode right after the next, I had to look at the synopsis once again to remember what it was about.  Not as memorable as things like Pride and Prejudice and Downton Abbey, but great watching in the minute!

159463176X|3.0|Many a time there are writers who strike it big with their first \\"hits.\\" THE KITE RUNNER was clearly one of those. Although it had some flaws, I loved that story. Something about that first book is magic. I saw it with Amy Tan's THE JOY LUCK CLUB, and so many others. But this one, as well as his last, is just not as good.<br />The energy and the ambition to create a compelling story was there. It just does not pan out--either because the author is trying to do too much--there's also the problem of jumps in time and sequence, and all in all, there's not much of a story here.
B00A8ECU24|2.0|there is no exit button to leave the game. Even if we shut off the kindle the game is still on when we turn it on again and with no exit so we must shut down the kindle and restart it. Very annoying

141659521X|5.0|\\"The Last Man\\" was Vince Flynn's newest Mitch Rapp installment released before his recent untimely death.  I found it to be excellently plotted, complicated but not overly labyrinthian.  All the facets of Rapp's character that make him one of the most dangerous men in the world are on full display.  As is usual, all the characters are fully fleshed and the dialogue is exceedingly believable.  It is always a pleasure to read the exploits of our favorite characters when we become so comfortable with them and those that surround them.<br /><br />When a highly valuable CIA asset is apparently kidnapped in Afghanistan, Mitch Rapp is sent in to ascertain the damage and, if possible, to recover him.  Mitch finds incompetence and treachery everywhere he turns in his search for the truth regarding the missing CIA operative.  Complicating matters is the appearance of an officious FBI official who is a dupe for a US Senator sent to investigate both Rapp and Joe Rickman, the missing asset.  Who has Rickman and is he even alive?  He is too dangerous to lose for long as he is privy to mountains of information on CIA assets and plans in the Middle East.  Who can Rapp trust now that he is on the ground in Afghanistan?  Who is the mysterious assassin sent to terminate Mitch and who is behind him?<br /><br />Great characters, deadly action, and intriguing interplay between CIA and FBI counterparts mixed with the duplicity of almost every Pakistani and Afghan leader make for interesting straight-from-the-headlines reading. Rapp's instincts and his superior ability to \\"read\\" people keep him plowing ahead to stop an enormous plot even when others seem relieved that it might be over.  The pacing is strong with parts that are at almost breakneck speed with the tension ratcheting so high that the reader has to set the book down to take a breath at times.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Flynn's work with Mitch Rapp, or just a casual fan of intense suspense/thrillers, \\"The Last Man\\" should keep you glued to its pages until the satisfying conclusion and denouement.  It is always tragic to lose a great writer so soon in life but what a powerful legacy he left behind.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|I really love this game, but if it weren't for the vehicles, I would just play TF2 on the PC. Great game though.<br /><br />SUGGESTIONS:<br />1. Put a turret on the helicopter<br />2. Make people fall when the helicopter they are using explodes<br />3. MORE MAPS<br />4. Make a fragger class that uses explosives<br />5. Make it so we can use the airplanes.<br /><br />If you add all this, I will change my review to 5 stars.

B00797MB0O|3.0|Not The Best...But Worth a View If You Like Patton Oswalt & Charlize Theron.  I wish that it had more comedic lines in it.  Tends to be a bit...pathetic & sad like others said.<br /><br />On the other hand, I could see how people end up like she does in the movie.  Realistic?  Probably.  Entertaining?  Not so much.  3 of 5 & I'm being generous.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Simply put, this is the best Superman movie ever made.  Forget about the old Donner films, they are classics but don't hold for today's times. This time around, Kal-El takes himself and the dangers around him seriously and throws more than just a punch. This is right up there, if not better, than last year's The Avengers, and also takes back the DC crown from Batman. If you have yet to watch it, do yourself a favor and go right now!
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This movie actually was much better than I thought it would be.  I had remembered seeing a trailer for it in the theater and thinking that it looked like it could easily be really bad so when I hadn't heard much about it from people I figured that it did just that.<br />This movie really has a little something for everyone- humor, action, horror, and romance.  The story line is well written and the characters well developed.  It's a great little movie to curl up to on a weekend night when you're wanting some zombie action, but don't want to battle the crowds at the theater for the latest one that has just come out.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|You learn 9-11  is the day the dad dies in this movie. Then it isn't so much the day that matters,but  a dad who had such an amazing relationship with his son. My heart breaks when I first see the sadness engulfing the son. His mom is in and out,and comes back, for us to understand, eventually. But the idea of the movie is amazing in that,it could be and feels all true life. I could see this playing out. I recommend this movie. You want to save this child from his journey,by being with him. And actually through out the whole film,you are. Great movie.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Boring and I don't look forward to picking it up. Have force myself to complete it.i don't like he main character
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very fun, the kids love to play the game all the time. It almost reminds of Temple Run in a way.
B004W1GCNC|3.0|As a fan of the 1st Upstairs, Downstairs when it was first shown, I looked forward to this one . I only got around to seeing it after watching all of the fabulous Downton Abbey. I found the first season (3 episodes) engrossing enough to go to the second and last season (6 ep.), but was saddened in seeing a very aged Rose (jean Marsh, the original Rose from the 1st show). I did think (spoiler alert) that they killed off one of the best and sympathetic characters way too soon, and preceded the same philosophy in the second season. The second season became a true soap opera with most characters being unworthy of empathy and saddled with a convoluted plot that focused on a little too much political minutia.<br /><br />I think they tried too hard to outdo Downton as a soap opera, and rather than creating a solid story
B0074VTHKM|3.0|I have always liked Grisham.  Maybe I just not into this age range.  I think this would be OK for the teen group.

B002JODPSO|4.0|This is an over the top film meant to entertain and that's exactly what it does. It fits right in with the rest of the die hard movies.
B003GXJ072|5.0|One of the scariest movies I've ever seen.  Love it!  Now going to introduce it to my grandson, who happens to have never seen it.  I'd recommend this movie to everyone to watch, but not alone.
B0091REZMW|4.0|so far okay to play this game.  have not gotten that far along yet.  just posting to get the task finished.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|My daughter loves this app on her kindle. The settings really do live up to the HD feel the game claims to have. There are a good many things you can do for the pets to care for them. This is great for kids who love animals- but u do have to purchase most of the pets but they multiply as you play with them.

B009TZ7WDK|5.0|I first came across Charlotte and Jonathan while surfing through some YouTube videos and I was overwhelmed by the beauty and excellence of this wonderful duet.  Jonathan's voice is very powerful and Charlotte gives the duet a beautiful compliment and contrast. I love them as a team!!!  This is a very powerful and moving CD! Truly, this CD is the beauty and magnificence of the human voice at its best. You both have been a blessing to me so may God bless each of you in return!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The star lit journey of a love few find, rarely so young. Beautiful, intoxicating, consuming the reader in a metaphor for what was endured by characters.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|In total, I love this show.  The cast is solid, well acted and directed, the story lines are mostly believable and the court room drama is just enough to add to the overall package.  The interweaving of the personal lives in the law firm is very interesting as well.  I look forward to every episode and find myself watching 2 or 3 in a row.<br /><br />Excellent production value make the show a joy to watch.
B004IK30S2|5.0|I loved the movie even more while watching it in BluRay! Such a crisp and clear picture! Can it get any better?

B00AU15HPC|5.0|Its been 16 years since The View From the Hill was released, and the follow-up live recordings at San Juan Capistrano.<br />Finally and surprisingly, Justin has re-emerged with this new solo album of songs that only he could compose.  I would not call every song great, but mixed among this album are some of the most beautiful songs Justin has written, harkening back to Blue Jays and that style that floored me and the friends of mine who were big fans.  Timeless music, words about love & spirit, that only Justin can make with his great rhyming, gentle voice, & touching melodies.  Throw in a touch of western instruments & remakes of Its Cold Outside of Your Heart & Broken Dreams (one of his best songs ever), & a little techno at the end, and it is an amazing energetic mix of styles.  Go Justin!

B0049VVE7Y|3.0|After playing the tell-tale game series of The Walking Dead, I decided to check out the show.  I was disappointed after buying the season pass to realize how few episodes there were in season one.  But the quality of the video is perfect and the show itself is very good as far as shoot-em-up-gore goes.  The show definitely improves as it goes on, including in seasons 2 and 3.

Everything You Have Heard Is True!<br /><br />‘Amadeus’ The Man! The Music! The Magic! The Madness! This is the incredible, mostly true story about the relationship between two composers in 18th century Vienna. Antonio Salieri, the successful court composer for Emperor Joseph of Austria, and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, a child prodigy who, while vulgar and irritating, writes the greatest music the world has ever heard. The film unfolds in a series of flashbacks, as Antonio Salieri is consumed with jealously by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's natural talent, and is unable to accept the knowledge that he will never possess the genius of a man he cannot stand. The film is presented in the Director's Cut, which features about 20 extra minutes of footage from the theatrical release.<br /><br />FILM FACT: 1985 Academy Awards® Won: Best Actor in a Leading Role for F.

Peter Shaffer's 1979 play and subsequent screenplay adaptation, partially inspired by a 19th century play by Alexander Pushkin and subsequent opera by Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov, takes the lives of these artists as a starting point for a highly fictionalised drama of envy and audacity; it's the anguished cry of a cultured artist with aspirations beyond his talents who declares war against a crude, boorish young man who has been graced with the genius he so desperately craves.<br /><br />Their music may seem high-brow by contemporary standards, but back in the 18th and 19th centuries, popular classical composers were the rock stars of their day, often achieving great wealth and privilege and engendering the admiration of everyone from peasants to kings. Though many were serious, aloof, and square, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, perhaps more than any of his peers, embraced the role. He partied, spent frivolously, and died young under mysterious circumstances. 'Amadeus' may perpetuate the legends and myths that swirl about this musical icon, but Milos Forman's film adaptation celebrates the composer's genius so completely, anyone who sees this Oscar® winning work will take away one emotion above all others.<br /><br />The story of Salieri's pathological jealousy and scheming attempts to sabotage Mozart's reputation and career is historically dubious to say the least--historians have noted that their professional rivalry was also marked by mutual respect and they even collaborated on a (now lost) cantata and his &#34;mediocrity&#34; a matter of context. Salieri was an influential composer and teacher in his day, no genius but a consistent creator of popular works whose work (like those of so many of his contemporaries) fell out of favour while the undeniably magnificent work of Mozart became part of the classical canon. But it is that contrast between the revered and the forgotten that makes Amadeus so compelling, with the aging artist living out his life in the shadow of the dead Mozart and recounting the story of how he killed Mozart (or so he says) to a dubious priest.<br /><br />'Amadeus' is largely fictitious, but it cleverly takes seeds of truth and grows them into a compelling, substantive narrative. Both Mozart and especially Antonio Salieri are well-drawn, complex creations, and Peter Shaffer (who won a Tony Award for his play and an Oscar for his adapted screenplay) instils in them a multitude of conflicting qualities. We admire Mozart, but it's hard to like him; we can relate to Antonio Salieri, yet can't condone his reprehensible actions. What makes Antonio Salieri such a marvellous character is that despite all his ill will, it's impossible for him to temper his unabashed wonder over the perfection of Mozart's music. Sure, he takes glee in sabotaging Mozart, but he's also the composer's biggest fan. And tragically, the pure, simple beauty of Mozart's notes and phrases, music that elevates so many and plunges Antonio Salieri's soul into darkness.<br /><br />All the acting is terrific, especially F. Murray Abraham as the tormented, conniving Antonio Salieri. His scenes as an elderly man recalling his relationship with Mozart and confessing his sins are riveting, and devoid of the affectations so many less talented performers employ when playing &#34;old.&#34; Tom Hulce captures Mozart's randy playfulness and sly conceit, as well as his sober sense of purpose and enslavement to music. His silly laugh becomes grating over time, but, of course, that's the point. As Mozart's commoner wife, Elizabeth Berridge is far better than I remembered her to be, and her no-nonsense, rough-around-the-edges personality nicely contrasts with the stuffy, fawning atmosphere of the emperor's court. (The Director's cut more completely develops her relationship with Antonio Salieri, and adds more depth to her character and performance.) And in a small supporting role, a teenage Cynthia Nixon ['Sex and the City'] makes a notable splash as a naive servant girl Salieri hires to spy on the Mozarts. On its surface, 'Amadeus' may seem like a story of revenge and bitterness, but it's really about the transformative power of music, and how it can shape and twist fragile human psyches. It's a stirring, impeccably produced work and deserving of all the accolades it received.<br /><br />Released in 1984, five years after the original stage production debuted in London, the film was a popular and critical hit and swept the Academy Awards® by winning eight Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director for Forman, Best Adapted Screenplay for Shaffer and Best Actor for F. Murray Abraham. In 2001, Forman (with the blessings of both Peter Shaffer and Saul Zaentz) prepared a longer &#34;Director's Cut&#34; for a new theatrical release, incorporating about 20 minutes of extra footage unseen in the original cut, which of course has been included in this Special Blu-ray release.<br /><br />‘Amadeus’ brought a new popular interest in the music of Mozart (the soundtrack recording became one of the best-selling classical albums of all time) and turned the classical composer into a pop-culture figure (which reached its height or perhaps it’s so called swan song, with the dance hit &#34;Rock Me Amadeus&#34; by Austrian singer Falco). The most surprising reverberation from the movie was the rediscovery of Antonio Salieri, all but forgotten for well over a century until the movie inspired orchestras to seek out his works and companies to revive his operas. But even with this minor resurgence of interest, it is the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart that makes this film sings with the voice of angels.<br /><br />Blu-ray Video Quality – Though Warner Home Video 1080p encoded transfer is far from perfect, 'Amadeus' makes a fairly solid transition to Blu-ray, especially when one considers its age. Many scenes are slightly on the soft side, but there's a healthy complement of sharp, well-defined images that burst forth with excellent contrast and vibrant colour. Noticeable grain preserves the film-like feel and suits the period setting well, but never garners undue attention, even in dimly lit scenes. There's a lot of colour on display like reds are especially lustrous and rich and the transfer handles the faint variances with ease. Though primaries shine, I was extremely impressed by the delicate pastel tones, powder blues, sea greens, and lavenders, all of which are exceptional. Many costumes flaunt intricate patterns and lots of adornment, but there's never any shimmering or breakup. Blacks possess appropriate depth (the tone really stands out in the gentlemen's jackets), shadow delineation is quite good, and fine details, such as wood grain and the weave of paper documents, can be striking. Close-ups aren't as crisp as those in new releases, but they're revealing enough to catch beads of sweat glistening on the brows of many actors, especially Tom Hulce. Stable, true flesh tones predominate, and Abraham's heavy makeup as the elderly Salieri looks, for the most part, very natural, even in high-definition. Some digital doctoring has been applied to spruce up the image, but it's subtle enough to keep critical characteristics intact. A few close-ups look a bit smooth, but the effects are never so blatant that I felt distressed or annoyed. Without question, 'Amadeus' has benefited enormously from this 1080p encoded image upgrade, but the image still can't rival the perfection of its subject's artistry.<br /><br />Blu-ray Audio Quality – The artistry of course is Mozart's glorious music. In the grand scheme of things, it doesn't really matter if dialogue is intelligible, surrounds kick in, or effects are distinct on this 5.1 Dolby TrueHD sound track; the music needs to be damn near perfect. Without proper dynamic range, tonal depth, and a broad sound field, the impact of Mozart's melodies on Antonio Salieri personally and the audience at large would not be nearly as great, and the story would suffer. Now, some may say Warner's penchant for 16-bit audio compromises Mozart's musical canon, but I can't imagine a better sonic treatment. From delicate strings to bombastic bursts of brass, from a soprano's trills to a robust basso aria, the track provides exceptionally pure, full-bodied tones with wonderful texture and shadings. Both symphonic and operatic sequences fill the room, immersing the listener in Mozart's playful, elegant, and passionate strains. Close your eyes and you'll swear you've been transported to a cavernous concert hall. During dramatic scenes, the audio is anchored up front, but noticeable separation enlivens the action, while subtle ambient effects occasionally grace the rears. Dialogue is very well prioritized, so we rarely miss a word of Peter Shaffer's Oscar-winning adaptation, and details such as the palace's squeaky wood floors and the ruffling of the layered period clothing are all vividly rendered. Aside from a few potent rumbles during the Don Giovanni segment, the subwoofer is almost silent, but low end bass is gorgeous whenever the music dips into that register, and conversely, even the highest soprano notes resist distortion. Again, say what you will about the 16-bit, Warner Home Video deserves kudos for this 100%.<br /><br />Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:<br /><br />Audio Commentary: Director Milos Forman and writer Peter Shaffer settle in for a substantive three-hour chat that covers many topics. The two men obviously like and admire each other and create a comfortable rapport, and their lively banter keeps the track moving. Shaffer insists that even though the story itself is pure invention, &#34;there was a basis of truth in everything I did.&#34; A Mozart scholar, Peter Shaffer imparts a wealth of fascinating titbits about both composers that adds a great deal to the film; most notably, his belief that Mozart died of kidney failure brought on by ingesting too much mercury, which he used to ease the effects of syphilis. He says &#34;a piece of gossip led to a disputed truth&#34; that Antonio Salieri poisoned Mozart, and this controversial nugget inspired him to write the original play. Forman points out where deleted scenes have been reinserted and both men criticise a few of their own creative choices. This is an essential track for anyone whose interest has been piqued by the people, events, and subject matter of the film.<br /><br />Special Feature Documentary: The Making of ‘Amadeus’ [2002] [480i] [4:3] [61:00] This riveting film takes a look behind the scenes at one of the 20th Century's cinema classics and at one of contemporary cinema's most maddeningly brilliant directors, Milos Forman. Using never before seen materials, from original costume and set sketches to an innumerable collection of intimate on-set photography, blended with vibrant and revealing new interviews of the cast and crew, The Making of ‘Amadeus’ weaves a spellbinding tale, filled with drama and humour.

From start to finish, The Making of Amadeus takes an unblinking look at the trials and tribulations of this mammoth production effort. From the conflicts as Forman goes head-to-head with the world-renowned playwright Sir Peter Schaffer as they take Amadeus from stage to screen, to the seven months of on location filming in communist era Czechoslovakia. With sets crawling with undercover secret police, Milos Forman returns to his native land from exile for the first time in 20 years. He discovers that in order for the film to succeed he must put all his personal emotions aside. In a world in which communist inefficiency reigns supreme and logic seemingly does not apply, the cast and crew embark on a voyage filled with some of the most memorable filmmaking experiences of their lives as east meets west. Featuring interviews with Milos Forman, producer Saul Zaentz, playwright Sir Peter Schaffer, choreographer Twyla Tharp, conductor Sir Neville Marinner, lead actors Tom Hulce, F. Murray Abraham, and Elizabeth Berridge, among many others, The Making of ‘Amadeus’ provides a riveting glimpse at a world most never get to see. Executed with a tenderness and craft rarely seen in other &#34;making of films,&#34; The Making of ‘Amadeus’ is a film that can hold its own against the power of the work it seeks to chronicle.<br/><br />Original Theatrical Trailer [2001] [480i] [2:00]<br /><br />Special Compact Disc Compilation [57:00] An audio sampling of eight Mozart pieces from both the symphonic and operatic realms, performed by the Academy of St. Martin-in-the-Fields under the direction of Sir Neville Marriner, who supervised the music in the film.

B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I was very disappointed in the ending.  Also, there was too much about servants and not enough about the family.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|This book was disappointing to me, definitely not as interesting as the first.  It's just a regular love story without the S&M twist. The amateurish writing is even more annoying. I won't even bother with #3 to see how it ends.
B0011ZTWI4|5.0|The first time I really heard Before I Forget I was blown away. Hard Rock and Fast Heavy Metal Gallops bring intensity from Jim Root and Mick Thompson, while Cory Taylor is heard like never before. Cory's powerful voice will carry you through the Blister Exists, and the genius mentality behind Duality. Pick this album up and jam!

B004GBIE3Y|1.0|Really? Don't waste your time. It could have been a great, moving story, but ended up being tacky and sexual in a very awkward and uncomfortable way.

B000ZMCVRI|5.0|Having listened to DMB, OAR, and others it's impossible not to see the strong influence from Marley and the Wailers.  The songs have a great rythm and are easy to sing along to.  The kind of music you'd be proud to play at your barbeque.

B00847KFDS|3.0|The album by CCR is far superior to this CD , altho is is great to hear a new take on some songs...I'd advise 1st time buyers to get the album w/ Born on the Bayou & Keep on Booglin...Probably around 1971 or so...that album is second to none...........
B00CWY76CC|1.0|Level 2 does not work. I even YouTube it thinking I was missing something. I really enjoyed it until it didn't work.
0812982622|4.0|For some reason this book reminded me most of \\"100 Years of Solitude\\". Not in terms of plot, but tone. It is told in a quick, matter of fact tone that makes even the most gruesome scenes feel whimsical. I have no idea whether it is an accurate portrayal of N Korea. But I suspect that most readers are less interested in geopolitics, and more interested in a very different kind of story, and on that it delivers. This book immerses you in a different, often absurd world that I found fascinating.
0060557818|5.0|This is such an imaginative book, but you never feel like you're in a fantasy because it seems so real. The characters are very different from each other. The main character is easy to identify with. But the best part of the story is the ending! I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet, but let me say that it is the best, most satisfying, perfect ending in any book I've ever read!!!
160459201X|5.0|I started reading this as soon as it arrived.  The practice of training my subconscious mind has also begun.

B004SIIBGU|5.0|use this app every day, saves me soo much money. I will never pay full price again after downloading ebay!
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|The team at DHX media gives us another gem. This very easily could have been a 3 part episode in Season 4 without skipping a beat.  All that those who loves the show have come to expect is present here in spades.  Easter eggs for fans, nods to the other Pony universe, in jokes to those familiar with the TV Show and the adult fanbase, the amazing voice work, the great music, it is all hear.  The characters we know and love shine through, their bodies may be different shapes, but it's still the same Twilight, AJ, Dash, Fluttershy, Pinkie, Rarity, Luna, Celestia, etc that we have grown to know and love.  It didn't get boring once, the songs, while in a different style were still amazing and awesome, and catchy, Twilight has plenty of adorkable moments to enjoy, and the Magic of Friendship really does transcend all.  Even the romantic tension, which I expected to hate was handled well, and fit with the situation, and while the staff have said the events of the movie will not effect season 4....I find that almost disappointing, It would be nice to see how the experiences Twilight had would affect her in her new found role.<br /><br />The only thing missing were the pony pets, no gummy, no opal (though she may have had a cameo with fluttershy) no tank, no owlowicious,.  They didn't really have a place in the film based on the pacing, the human world only has the one setting, the high school, but casual mention of them, when the girls meet Twilights \\"dog\\" would have been cool.<br /><br />All in all, when I heard they were doing this I was turned off and disappointed, then I saw the trailers, and got excited for it, now that I have seen the movie, much like the Princess Twilight thing, I feel bad for jumping to conclusions, and I loved the experience fully.  I have no idea what features if any are on the disc, I don't care I am buying it anyway.
0345541588|4.0|This is the first JR book that I have read, but it won't be the last. I did not expect much, as this is not my usual genre. But it grabbed me from the first chapter and never slowed down.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My horse is a fantastic game with wonderful graphics. I would just make 1 minor change. No more energy. I believe that the energy defeats the entire purpose of the game. The part where you make the food was a very smart idea. The entire game is a very smart idea except the energy. It makes me have to wait all day to get some energy.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game is as good as any PC dungeon crawler RPG.  Great mobile game for on the road play and it is free.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Fun, interesting, entertaining and even educational (in an historical way).  Every character has a unique personality and purpose weaving a portrait of 19th century life in an English hamlet.
0374214913|3.0|This is a quick read, fun, amusing, harmless. The author creates a good mystery and keeps it going. But even though you know it is not going to pay off big, it is still inevitably a bit disappointing in the end.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My kids enjoyed this game 3,4 yr old  keeps them entertained..not something they want to play everyday but still a good game
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am speechless. Every word in this book is pure perfection. I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel Grace \\"the way you fall asleep: slowly, then all at once.\\" Anyone who reads this book, has glanced at heaven in words. I know it's heaven because Augustus is in it. The book was perfection.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|. It was beautiful for the movie, but I really have to say it looses the musical touch and composer of the book (how the book was laid out like a musical piece)<br /><br />Also, they left out my favorite part of the book. Still 4.5 out 5 stars from me though . Definitely one to own.
0451228731|3.0|I read this purely because other reviewers compared it to \\"Ready Player One\\". But Daemon is no where close. It starts well and is creative at times. But the characters are flat, and the ending (a big, ridiculous chase scene that reads like the author is more interested in angling for a movie deal than being true to his own story) is disappointing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game!!!!! This game is so fun and entertaining. I loved that it travels around the world.I wonder what are you doing next.Thank you.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun ! Great for children! And a great competition against your Facebook friends! I Recommend You All To Download This Game! The theme of the game changes every 33 days So, Thats something to be excited about.... :)
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read every Stephen King book ever and this is one of his best. It's one of those books you don't want to end.
1401324649|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but it could have been better. The Forest Gump-ian way that the plot unfolds is outstanding. Very creative. The characters are interesting, but some lack depth. The book is often amusing, but rarely laugh out load funny (although it wants to be I suspect). Mainly, I wish the main character had found a little to be introspective about at the end of his many adventures. The reader learns a bit of history along the way, but the hero never really grows beyond his whatever-happens-happens view of life.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Read it, that's all I'm going to say.  You know him, you love him.  After, check out Unclogged, that's right, Howie Weener Unclogged http://amzn.to/13js5B4  Its a colonic noir musical memoir.  More E-MAGINATION!  Hilarious and original.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Very addicting addicting game!  I got hooked on this game in Facebook.  It's great to have it on my Kindle also.
B008Q00BOQ|5.0|Actin packed thriller with very good acting. Visual effects stuuning and very beautiful scenery from around the world. One of the best in the series...
1597801585|4.0|If you are in the mood for a bit of dystopia, this might do it. It is rather dark, and there is not really anyone to root for. But this future world is very fully realized. I don't usually like things that have the evil corporate machine at its center, but i did not mind that so much here since there is so much other stuff going on.
B004FOA84A|1.0|This game was frustrating and unsatisfying. No help function, short, weird ending. I would not recommend it even if it were free.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love Twitter because you can't write on and on!  If I want to read a book I'll buy one!  Keep it short and move on!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Not my usual read of survival books and such but very entertaining.  The HBO Series rocks but the books give you much more<br /><br />Steve<br />[...]
0812550706|4.0|Amazon recommendations have been steering me towards dystopian sci fi ever since i read \\"Ready Player One\\" (which you should go read immediately btw). Some of it has been pretty good (Ie: Wool, The Shifts, Windup Girl) considering that i am not a particular fan of the genre. I enjoyed \\"Ender's Game\\" too. It stands up very well considering its age.  And it is interesting to see how derivative other works actually are that I thought were pretty original (Harry Potter, Hunger Games, Starship Troopers).
B0035JRUZQ|5.0|A great Wayne western with great group of costars. This is one of my favorites that can be watched over and over. The combination of Wayne and Mitchum  is a good combination. cant beat the Prime rental 0$$$.
B00766CLPI|5.0|Her politics aside, Barbara is one of the truly great voices of our time.  Her &#34;In Trutina&#34; from Carmina Burana is the best I've ever heard.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love Gideon and Eva! Really shows their individual growth as well as growth of the relationship. Sylvia Day's style of writing continues to add moments of &#34;I didn't see that coming&#34; and &#34;WOW!! I really didn't see that coming&#34;.<br />Great follow up in the series.
0307887448|5.0|This is my favorite book of the last two years. It is incredibly inventive in the way it mixes a future vision of high tech with the nostalgia of being a child of the eighties. So many of my favorite games and movies are here, given new life. And the characters do not take a back seat. You will root for them.
B0058W74UY|5.0|works very well. been able to see my stuff. i was having a hard time, but with this i've been able to view most of my videos.
B005HEPN06|5.0|I admire the character that Patrick Stewart plays. Captain PIcard is a great example to adults and the youth on how to conduct oneself when in a leadership position. He is firm and kind. What a great father figure he is.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a good show, but even though I knew from spoilers what would happen it still upset me to see rhe end of some characters.  Too much like life I think.  Still, an excellent show.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have always enjoyed Vince Flynn's books and eagerly looked forward to each one. His recent passing at such a young age was a true loss.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|See my review of Doctorow's Makers. Doctorow opened the way and forecasted the birth of a new way of making, Anderson describes the new world born from the new technologies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think it's a fun game for kids who like to play games that start out slow and end fast.
B00B29J0I6|3.0|The game is ok  if the Amazon game circle would not pop up in the in the middle of the game. Is there a y way to fix that problem.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|A friend suggested this movie to me. The entire focuses on how people cope during a global disaster through the eyes of a father and son who was born after the disaster occurred.  It forces the viewer to really examine if they would retain their humanity while striving to survive or succumb to their most basic needs for survival.<br /><br />The drama is intense, gritty and for me, was deeply moving.  The cast of this character-driven movie is stellar and includes Robert Duvall an Charlize Theron in supporting but pivotal roles.
159463176X|3.0|Wow...I really wanted to read his third book so badly, and even though it took him so long to finish it and I was impatient for it, I was also happy that it was taking him such a long time, for what a masterpiece must come from his hands now!<br />Yet, the book is underwhelming to me. It starts out very promising but it jumps from character to character, place to place and era to era with no clear indication and explanation leaving me fumbling in the dark until I figured it out. This happened over and over again in the book and I found it became frustrating and almost exhausting, and I just wanted to get it over and done with. It became 'that' book yes... the one you can't quite put down and can't finish soon enough...<br /><br />On the other hand, and this is why I gave it 3 stars, the way he uses words and allows you to feel the character's anguish/emotions/joy etc. is one of a kind and still true to his gift as an author. He definitely deserves another chance and I will read his next novel. I am hoping it will be more in the style of his first two stunners.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I think the story line is interesting, I like the interaction between the two lead characters, and among all the members of the staff of the law firm, and I love the setting in New York. I like it almost as well as I like &#34;White Collar,&#34; which has some of the same characteristics.
B004NELBPC|5.0|Like reading other news programs to get other views on all the news.  Not all reporting news articles are all the same. Huffington is up to date and a good source.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|Great music for driving in the car, sitting by the pool or just for listening to when you want to liven up you mood.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This album is a splendid mix of violin riffs laid over electronic beats. It's a breath of fresh air in a landscape of overused electronic loops and beats. I highly recommend it!
0307743659|1.0|Mr. King loved the book but hated the movie.  I loved the movie, but, found the book a tedious waste of money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This a fun and entertaining application. Makes your brain work! Good job! Keep developing good applications that challenge our brain.
0316228532|2.0|Words can not describe how disappointed I was with this book! No, I was not expecting Harry Potter characters, but I was expecting relatable characters that would draw you in to the story. I have never left a book unread once I start it, but I was truly tempted with this one. The only thing that kept me going was the hope that it would get better....it didn't...it just got more depressing :-(
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Okay, I admit I watched this on a \\"cable style\\" offering at the friend's home, but I'm prepared to buy my own copy. Having listened to a recording of a previous broadcast of Chicago's Lyric's Rigeletto, the same afternoon, I found myself laughing at one moment and in near tears the  next. This is a wonderful, quiet dignified yet very funny movie with outstanding performances by the \\"quartet\\" as well as the supporting cast. So buy it, cook dinner for a friend of many years as I did and watch this film. Bravo, Mr. Hoffman. If you had to wait all this time to direct, this film was certainly worth the wait.
B001P7HUF0|1.0|Bad acting, slow story, politically hijacked message.  I wasted two hours of my life. Skip this and you'd miss nothing.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|The talent code inspires you to work for your dream, providing research to show just what it takes to reach it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|GREAT, FUN, just needs more levels. It's challenging enough but not frustrating.<br />  Looking forward to Many more levels to give a final 5 stars.
B003D83DPA|4.0|Excellent early performance (pre-Brothers In Arms) from this talented band. Mark Knopfler and his band show their talent and professionalism.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great story... just make sure you have a box of tissues available at the end! Five more words are required :)
0618526412|5.0|I somehow had never read this classic, although I knew of it. I'm so glad I finally have read it. I don't see how McCullers, who was only 23 when she wrote it, was able to capture people so well.<br /><br />A friend and I watched the movie afterwards. It was a good movie by itself, but disappointing after reading the book. Too many things were changed. AT least they kept the ending which is always a complaint of mine. But the acting was great.
1475143389|5.0|Mike Matthews' books have a place on my bookshelf (or Kindle) right next to Jason Ferruggia, Brad Pilon, Martin Berkhan, John Berardi, Dan John, Mark Rippetoe and Stuart McRobert.<br /><br />If you're a fan of any of the above authors, then this series is for you.
B008B3MZNI|4.0|Brought back memories of a fantastic band that seems all but forgotten these days. Rodger Hodgson and Rick Davies have completely different writing styles, but it gives Supertramp the yin and yang.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Imaginitive beginning of a series that lasted through the ages.  All people of different backgrounds are treated equally.  For its time, the technology was pretty darn good.
B00AZ5AO1U|5.0|Awesome sound quality on this one!<br />Mo-Fi discs are usually hit or miss, this one hits dead center...<br />(I have disc number 00124)
B000XUHVY0|5.0|I recently discovered this band after listening to a lot of other symphonic metal, like Nightwish, WT and Epica. I was extremely impressed with this band and album. Rarely do I enjoy an album this much immediately. The music itself is very well done and is creative and engaging and the vocals are nearing the level of Tarja and Simone Simons.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I was delighted to see that the Who series is offered through Amazon Prime. I grew up watching this series, when my local  stations would offer it as a late, late, show, and later then when it was offered on cable. I stopped consuming cable due to declining cost/benefit, and my local video store does not carry this series. So, as an alternative to committing a lot of $$ to buying the episodes, I am able to stream them on demand via the Prime service.  By introducing new Doctors and co travelers every few years, the producers are able to effectively &#34;re-invent&#34;  the story around new characters.  Just need to set aside more time to watch....
B00785P2QC|4.0|I would rate this 5 stars if it hadn't keep asking me to go on facebook. Other than that, it's fine. Have fun.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun and is pretty challenging. The levels are very interesting. I do,however, wish that that it would offer some hints if you are stuck on a particular task.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A great read because it gives you more of a overall picture on what is going on,  the characters taht tie in tie in very well and new characters fit in.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This is an okay game for older kids it is a bit difficult for younger kids ( the ones who really can relate to Nemo)
B0093X805W|5.0|Just read this to my 6- and 4-year-old, and they loved it as much as I did at their ages.
B008Q08T54|4.0|This was a good movie. I really enjoyed watching it have everything I was looking for. I would recommend this movie for watching. ..
B000FBFN1U|5.0|very hard to put down, I kept reading and reading wanting to know what was happening next.<br />Highly recommend this book
B008NMT684|4.0|Got this puzzle app for my 4 year old nephew and he loved it! So easy to do and the balloons to pop at the end are an added bonus!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is such a cool game! It doesn't shove purchasing money to get you farther ahead up your nose like other games, and that in itself is enough for me to give it five stars!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This ia a cool game of trial and error.  The more you play the more you begin to recognize up coming clues.  The ads are not a problem on the free game but I will probably pay the 99 csnts as I play more to gst additional levels.
B00CWVF2GC|3.0|It was ok. Yossi was very fat and I couldn't see past it. Also, his vist to the dead boyfriend's parents was too much.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Hated everything about the way AccuWeather displayed the the weather information and how user friendly it wasn't.<br />Do not recommend.<br />I deleted it!<br />The Weather Channel is a 100% better App.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|Omg I thought there was only 3 books to this series !!! So much left hanging....... when is the next book due out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun. Mindless game to help u unwind. Able to buy your way past goals u cant slmeet.  Been addicted to it for awhile now.
B002NN5F7A|1.0|We were bored and kept waiting for the action to start. The big name actors were great, but this movie should have been better.
B004NDJXOO|5.0|I just want to add my enthusasiam for this awesome and rad movie! Not just a good 80's family movie, but a really good sports film that often gets over looked.  P.S. I have read in other reviews that people are looking for the soundtrack? I have a copy on cd,  email me at southchicagoirish@tmo.blackberry.net. I'm not looking to sell mine but I can tell you how I tracked it down.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Now this is a game to get! So far the most enthralling game that I've found on either the kindle fire or the Android market.  Do it, do it, do it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm really loving this game! its really fun. not to easy not to hard. I'm happy I got this game. more levels!!!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This movie was full of action. I am not comic book fan, but this movie was a lot of fun to watch! Great quality and sound.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Bring it on!<br />Fast action that is really fun for everyone. You power this boat at high speeds and smash into anything you want with out stopping your travel. Race down the river to your final destination and have the most fun getting there!<br />Highly recommend. You can play this over and over and enjoy every time you play.<br />Get it!! You won't be disappointed.<br />By the way, the controls are VERY responsive to your movements.
1582701709|5.0|I purchased a used copy. My copy was clean, spine was intact. Cover was intact and book had no writing in it just as promised.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The two books before this one had more events and story. This book seemed to be just laying the ground work for the next book. One major thing did happen though but it wasn't built up as much as I thought it would be. I am still looking forward to reading the next book.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I downloaded the Facebook to my Kindle so I could go on Farm Town. But I can't find Farm Town. So I don't use it
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|If you loved A Thousand Splendid Suns you will not be disappointed by Khaled Hosseini's most recent offering. I found it deeply moving and utterly absorbing. We can only hope he keeps writing.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, way ahead of current events. Never fails to amaze how he can predict the future so accurately . Read everything he writes.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Saw this show while in Asia.  About the only English speaking chanel I could find.  Turns out it was a great show.  Came home and watched both season one and season two on Amazon.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|So many threads and so little time; I found this to be a transition book that tantalized and puts the next book in the \\"must read on publication day\\" category. Any specifics would be spoiling for new readers; suffice it to say there are no characters ignored and too many open ends to not read this to continue the tale.<br />If you are this far a in The Game of Thrones, you will need to get your copy and enjoy.
0307476073|5.0|A true story.....well-told.  Great writing, great story.....bravo to Cheryl! Felt like she was right in front of me, telling her story.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I loved the partnership of Harvey Specter and Mike Ross. Together, they fight the injustice of NYC. Season 1 ended with Mike Ross being exposed that not only did he not attend Harvard, but he's not even an lawyer! Season 2 opens with the play out of Mike being exposed. Even when the firm is being attacked from all sides at the same time, the two manage to find wiggle room and come out on top. The chemistry between the two of them and the supporting characters makes this a very enjoyable and addictive series to watch. Looking forward to season 3 coming to USA in July 2013.
B00BW0QC8G|5.0|This backpack is very good for keeping your computer and iPad safe while carrying them around.  I was using a shoulder bag but I always worried about its safety with my computer and didn't fit my iPad well at all.  All the wires, etc. were in one pocket so I was always worried about pulling out a cord and accidentally losing my flash drive,etc.  This is so much easier and very well planned.  I can also put clothing and other items in the bag.  It's not for long term travel but a day bag.  Really nice and I can put my belongings in a better place.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Tough touch subject matter with grace and humor.  I literally found myself laughing out loud at times and truly enjoyed this read.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Really a lot of fun' reminds me of Mario Cart. Makes me laugh' well worth a few minutes down time :-)
B007SGM084|5.0|Very interesting books. I could not stop reading and on the last book she should of wrote more of Christian its very interesting his side.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is like watching a historical novel!  A person feels like they really get to know the characters.  The cast does a great job!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|One of my most favorite movies of all time.  What a delightful find and even more delightful man.  I can't stop listening to the sound track too!
B0026S93C0|4.0|Very 80's. good story, good music, good dancing, and wild hair. Even my teenagers love this movie. If you are in the eighties, this is a must.
B006INDTAQ|5.0|I loved the movie it was cool all the way threw it and want let you down.  I love scifi movies and this ones one of the best mad in the last few years with solid actors and good special effects.<br />Loved it...
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|the moment I got home I bought the ebook, which was equally amazing<br />Wachowskis are my absolute favorite filmmakers<br />if you have not experienced this, you are missing OUT<br />&#60;3
B004J4WKTW|5.0|When i search for a book I look for a nice interesting diversion that's easy to pick and and own during my busy day.  This one was perfect.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent book. After reading this I had to get the next book. The characters and story were absorbing. I am just getting to the review but originally read this before the movie was announced. If you saw the movie you should definitely read the book if you haven't already. I highly recommend this book.
0553381695|5.0|After reading the fist book I was hooked, the second book was excellent overall. I'll spare you a lot of details since this series is pretty well known and the TV series should tip you off if you like it well enough. At this point in the series I was still very much enjoying everything.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|The writers always come up with segments that challenges me to figure out where things are going. This season's  latest cliffhanger ending has me eager for season 8.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Unique not predictable characters you enjoy a love story between two very different people love that is based on a desire for the other person to be happy more than ones self
B003U4ZQUM|5.0|Fell in love with this series from the first and couldn't wait to watch them all .... what will happen?
B0062QRTKA|5.0|Great gameplay, wonderful stylish graphics, very fun game. Worth it's price, though I got it as a FAOTT. Escape from Egypt with style!
B003L77GGK|5.0|It took a while to adjust to the changes but ultimately it was absorbing and fun. Who comes up with these plots?!
B00149C8BK|5.0|How do you write a review for a master?? I have been listening to Michael since he was almost a toddler. From the earliest day it was clear that Michael was an artist unlike any we have ever seen. This album is just one example , one more piece of evidence that proves Michael IS the King of Pop.
B0054XOMX4|5.0|Phantom Orion B:D is awesome it can spin up to 6 minutes and 28.3 seconds it beet all my beys Evan earth eagal you should get it.
0321344758|5.0|Every web designer must have this book because it lists the fundamentals in a clear, concise and fun manner. As an analogy, yes everyone needs to live comfortably but the fundamental requirements are air, water, and food. This book provides those fundamentals.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is the most moving book I have read in years,  It explores relationships within a family and spans the globe.<br />I didn't want the book to end.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|In my opinion, the best from Michael. The problem with reviewing Michael is that he never did anything that was not top notch stuff. There is a special place in my heart for Michael,and this is a great work.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|I can't in good conscience recommend this game to friends.  Narrative and/or story line are nearly 100% absent from the game's \\"missions\\".  Gameplay is blatantly designed to extract in-app purchases from players; e.g. pay for gear, pay for power-ups, pay to get higher score, pay to revive.  Displays ads for other games even after player has paid something for this one.  Occasionally lags or even freezes on kindle fire.<br /><br />The game is also buggy (on kindle fire and probably others too).  For example, today I completed two missions during a run, but then the game locked up and forgot I had completed those missions.  Yesterday, I constructed some new armor, unlocked some other armor, bought some upgrades, and played for a while, but it eventually locked up and forgot everything I had done, including armor, missions, and XP.<br /><br />That said, it's a fairly enjoyable twitch game, and I have occasionally played it until the kindle's battery ran out.<br /><br />2013-07-20 update.  Last night, the Iron Man 3 game crashed hard and wouldn't start up any more.  Oh well.  Uninstalled.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|After reading Pillars of the Earth I was hoping for another series and I wasn't disappointed.  Another historical account of war, families, and interactions.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|you know when you want something simple yet awesome well I'll tell you this much I personally am impressed thanks n keep it coming
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|The graphics are fantastic.  The sense of depth and scenery are amazing. The controls couldn't be easier. There's just enough difficulty to keep it interesting (did that submarine just try to torpedo me??). But there's two flaws. The game wants your money, lots and lots of your money. The coin and gem system is so much more expensive than many other freemium games. Not enough (by about 1,000) coins for the next shark 'upgrade/evolution' that I'm at would cost $10. Of course I could earn those 16,000 coins in the game... therein is the next flaw. Coins are TOO scarce. I was at the point where I could upgrade from the hammerhead shark two days ago and I'm still over 5,000 coins short. You can either grind away at the same old thing which really ruins a game or spend a fortune to buy each upgrade/evolution level.<br />If it were even slightly easier to evolve. If coins were just slightly more prevalent, this would be a five-star game. But I have no urge to spend days grinding away just to buy the privilege of doing it again.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Nice spin on a saturated genre. The many story lines keep the subject fresh throughout. Recommend to any fans of horror fiction.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book 2 continues the saga of the families in book 1.  Another book I didn't want to end.  Can't wait for book 3
B0088W7VNG|5.0|after the first 4 seasons too bad it all has ended<br />guess I now have to go back to SG-1
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the game at first try.  Simple fun thing to do to relax before closing my eyes at night. Love it.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|There is something always going on and at the end of each show there is always a hook so that I want to know what will be coming up next time.
B005COO1X6|5.0|What a scary, intriguing short little ride this story was!  I couldn't stop until I reached the end!  Not too long of a story so it's very easy to read from beginning to end in one setting. You'll want to, believe me. Now, it's time to settle in so I can begin reading 11-22-63!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book held my attention beginning to end.  Quite an eye opener about blind parental love as usually its mom who wears the blinders.....but, no, this time its dad.  I recommended Defending Jacob to my book club the other night, only to find out three people had read it. They all gave it a thumbs up!
B008B68IV8|5.0|One of the biggest issues blind buying online is that you hope you get a good face up and let me tell you every doll I've bought through amazon has come through perfect!
1608193381|5.0|What Chang does is to take a apart assumptions that most of us on the right and left may have about capitalism. There is capitalism and then there is free market capitalism. He points out significant failures in the operational assumptions of both leftist economics and right wing economic policy. A notion that he discusses and that I particularly like is bounded rationality*. The assumption of many conservatives is that players in the market will act rationally and with a certain amount of enlightened self-interest if given the freedom to do so without regulation. This is, unfortunately, not an entirely accurate position in a society that has abandoned Judaeo-Christian values or never really had them to begin with. The markets are rational but only up to a point--as most individuals are. Given that the western calculus of virtue and vice is, essentially abandoned at the altar of acquisition, choices can default, and frequently do, to a less than optimal position for both society and the individual. The creation of financial instruments of mass destruction without agency purview, such as should have occurred with already established market organizations such as the SEC, is a classic example of less than optimal results chosen by completely free market economics. We can say: well this is how they should behave and should is always a compelling argument but in the absence of a \\"should\\" based economics \\"bounded rationality\\" is a more reliable predictor of group and individual behavior.<br /><br />I am still astonished that no one in the SEC was jailed for not providing sufficient warning to all parties about the dangers of derivatives. Nobody needs to be an economist to know that when some of these derivatives were squared and then even cubed that they were departing too far from the underlying value to be anything less than a huge risk. The \\"impatience\\" of capital that Chang talks about should really be translated as \\"greed\\".  It is astonishing to note that at one point the financial arms of both GE and GMAC were producing more than 50% of the profitability of both General Electric and General motors respectively and that in some countries, such as Iceland and Ireland, the financial profitability of pseudo banking organizations was up more than 300% over the profitability of national manufacturing. Money cannot be made out of thin air and if it is someone always pays for it.<br /><br />Chang makes some powerful arguments for a capitalism guided by the unseen hand of virtue as enshrined in some sort of industrial policy. He doesn't refer to it as that but essentially and without an industrial policy that takes into account the dark side of free market economics and the foolish optimism of over-regulation of vital areas that need less regulation, licensed criminals will continue to take America to the poorhouse. Institutionally speaking, the repeal of Glass-Steagal by both the left and the right was an astonishing failure to understand the casino mentality of most financial traders. I am not an economist but you simply cannot allow the foxes to guard the henhouse.<br /><br />____________________<br />Ha-Joon Chang (Korean: 장하준, Hanja: 張夏准, born October 7, 1963) is one of the leading heterodox economists and institutional economists specialising in development economics. Currently a Reader in the Political Economy of Development at the University of Cambridge, Chang is the author of several widely-discussed policy books, most notably Kicking Away the Ladder: Development Strategy in Historical Perspective (2002). He has served as a consultant to the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the European Investment Bank as well as to Oxfam and various United Nations agencies. He is also a fellow at the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C. In addition, Chang serves on the advisory board of Academics Stand Against Poverty (ASAP). Chang is also known for being an important academic influence on the economist Rafael Correa, currently President of Ecuador.<br /><br />Bounded rationality is the idea that in decision-making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision. It was proposed by Herbert A. Simon as an alternative basis for the mathematical modeling of decision making, as used in economics and related disciplines; it complements rationality as optimization, which views decision-making as a fully rational process of finding an optimal choice given the information available.[1] Another way to look at bounded rationality is that, because decision-makers lack the ability and resources to arrive at the optimal solution, they instead apply their rationality only after having greatly simplified the choices available. Thus the decision-maker is a satisficer, one seeking a satisfactory solution rather than the optimal one.[2] Simon used the analogy of a pair of scissors, where one blade is the \\"cognitive limitations\\" of actual humans and the other the \\"structures of the environment\\"; minds with limited cognitive resources can thus be successful by exploiting pre-existing structure and regularity in the environment.[1]<br /><br />Some models of human behavior in the social sciences assume that humans can be reasonably approximated or described as \\"rational\\" entities (see for example rational choice theory). Many economics models assume that people are on average rational, and can in large enough quantities be approximated to act according to their preferences. The concept of bounded rationality revises this assumption to account for the fact that perfectly rational decisions are often not feasible in practice because of the finite computational resources available for making them.nomist Rafael Correa, currently President of Ecuador.<br /><br />Bounded rationality is the idea that in decision-making, rationality of individuals is limited by the information they have, the cognitive limitations of their minds, and the finite amount of time they have to make a decision.

1781162646|5.0|Just got this and have not started it, but love Stephen King and will enjoy it this summer  - looks like a great read.
B00BFHZOCG|5.0|Normally, I tend to shy away from tribute albums, but I have been an Anthrax fan for decades, and I liked the track listing, so why not? I noticed was that Anthrax kept pretty true to the original songs, which I really liked. The covers of \\"Anthem\\" and \\"Big Eyes\\" are particularly great!
B000O14VAU|5.0|This movie has Kate Beckinsale in it. Is there anything else worth mentioning.  Any movie with Kate in it is 5 stars.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very addicting, and fun. Even my kids enjoy the challenge. I recommend if your looking for a fun challenging game.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book was a book club pick. I had two weeks to read it. It was captivating and I had no trouble keeping up with it. Some reviewers stated they had difficulty following the change in time and characters in the book with each chapter but it doesn't take long to remember to look at the chapter heading before you start reading.<br />Overall, well written. Good mix of mystery, love, and tragedy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Definitely the best book of the series.  A must read for anyone who is a Hunger Games fan....I liked it better than Twilight!
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The first book was the only book I liked . It dragged on too much about certain situations and didn't really focus on the two main characters
B00AREIAI8|4.0|A great app. Just like real horse back riding. Nice graphics. Like three d. Should be able to buy horses do  free
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This is a very slow building story, and honestly, it doesn't have a strong story arc.  However, the use of words and the descriptions are make it well worth reading this work.
B002LHX624|5.0|My son loves this book. The seller &#34; BoogieDownBooks&#34; was so helpful<br />and nice with us, when our mail was lost, BoogieDownBooks tried their best to compensate us, they tried their best that we receive our copy in the second time. I like to thank you BoogieDownBooks. I love making business with you.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Great movie I really enjoyed it!!!<br />Hope they make another one like this!!!!<br />I loved watching it in HD!!!<br />Thanks!
B001P06GX4|5.0|I got this game for my siblings, all the pieces were there. It came in great condition and came right on time. The game is so much fun and it seems complicated at first but when you figure out what your suppose to do to win its a blast! I recommend this game to any one.
B005XR3K5M|3.0|This product arrived in good condition. I wasn't very happy with the thickness of the cards, as they seemed thin and therefore flimsy, but I am willing to overlook this. It also came with what looked like instructions, but they were in Japanese so I don't know what they say. This is a really cool Legend of Zelda collectible.
B002SSUQFG|2.0|This thing looks good and does not require batteries.  It also gaines 2-3 minutes per day.  That's not acceptable.  No more Seikos for me!
0316228532|3.0|I heard J.K. say if you didn't cry at the end you had no heart, but really you knew what was going to happen well into the book. As usual way to many characters, no depths in any of them, and a little hgard to understand if your not British!
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is my most favorite movie. Ever since i watched it on adult swim long ago it became an instant favorite for me. I tried looking around for a blu ray version before purchasing this one, but I didn't go wrong with purchasing this one. :D
B00023B1A8|5.0|I really enjoyed the this DVD. It was worth every penny.I would recommend it to anyone who likes Crosby, Stills and Nash.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game! Makes you use your noggin and powers of deduction. If you like puzzles you will enjoy. I am already hooked.
0142000671|5.0|This book will always be a classic and one of my favorites. It doesn't matter how many times I read this, I always cry at the end. A must read!
B007U8UBGI|5.0|Jack white is one of my favorite artists now. Love interuption is my favorite song and i love the entire album as well
B007N8RULO|5.0|This is my favorite game of all card games.<br />I have been solving them all and have<br />fun beating moves and times.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Really enjoyed this movie. It was fun to watch with lots of action that kept us on the edge of our seat, and great characters that teamed up to help solve the mystery. The movie had a good pace and Bruce Willis was as charming as ever. Highly recommend it!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Seriously couldn't stop playing...but way too short kind of disappointed because there are currently only ten (?) Levels. Love it so far tho...just wish I could keep playing
B00785P2QC|5.0|Similar to games on Facebook but the graphics are different.  Still just as good and the other g5 games are good as well
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book was incredibly amazing. It was a quick read, and I couldn't put it down. Sparks' books never fail.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|This was an OK movie.  Visuals and special effects are really well done and the acting is on par with the production quality.  If you like movies with fantastic landscapes, then this movie may be up your alley.  You also need to really like fairytale romance stories.  Even if you like both of those movie elements though, ultimately this movie would probably disappoint unless you just are enthralled with the two main romantic characters.<br /><br /><***spoiler alert***> The plot is just a very unevenly paced love story that is missing all of the social revolution elements needed for the love story to actually happen.  I mean, she has amnesia for ten years, sees him, of course, after a few days remembers him and their teenage romance, and then is madly in love with him suddenly?  Things just overall happen too sporadically.  How does he go from being a nobody to suddenly being a goose with the golden egg for the Transworld Corp., but no one notices him hopping planets?  You'd think they'd have paid more attention to his comings and goings.  But, all of that aside, you kept expecting him to use his pink powder to create a revolution for the people \\"below\\", not anti-aging cream.  It is completely foreshadowed and really the only way you can imagine the love story working out. They can't be together \\"happily ever after\\" unless their worlds radically change.  They basically tell you, yes, we changed the world, with the last 2 minutes of the film, but say \\"that is another story\\"?  WTH?  That would have been the story to tell.  Changing the world for the love of your life would have been an entertaining plot.  Getting my butt handed to me only to have other people suddenly come to my rescue is not a great story to tell.  So again, (and even with what I have laid out, I don't think I given away too much of the plot), if you still want to rent the movie, make sure you are just a tissue abusing romance junkie who digs special effects.  Otherwise, this probably will ultimatelydisappoint you.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so really amazing and awesome. U should really get it. It is way better than the regular temple run.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book with a great story line. I loved the twist and turns the book took. And that Dean and Sky made it to the end together.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|I am stuck and can't seem to go any further.  There is no where to go to ask for help. I really like hints in hidden object games, or games like this one
B009UX2YAC|3.0|its a fun game BUT YOU NEED TO FIX THE MISTERY BOX ALL I EVER GET IS THE STUPID UFO
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|It is great to be able to play against my friends, using my Kindle Fire. The choice to play the tournaments makes it even more fun!
B000V39KDO|3.0|The acting was pretty good. The CG effects were way over the top. Maybe some liked that, I could have done with a little less.<br />This is an &#34;ok&#34; movie, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Entertaining movie, saw it in theaters, was great to watch it again on Amazon.  It was free with Amazon Prime
B0062QRTKA|4.0|I am sorry to all the families who lost loved ones while I was taking the Chosen People to the Promised Land. I truly wanted to save everyone but I didn't have the skill to protect all of the panickers, drunkards, snoozers, old men, and dumb people (this is the name of the character in the game). The Chosen People do not make themselves easy to save and therein lies the challenge. But 'lo, there are Heroes to help you, such as Adam and Eve, Moses, Jesus, Noah and El (not sure who this one is in the Bible). You will need every one of them to save this unruly group of Pharoah-fleeing followers.<br /><br />I can imagine the premise of the story will offend a few people. I mean the Pixelators have made a playful game of what was a traumatic flight from slavery and I promise you followers (Jews) will die by the hundreds while you play. If you can get your sensibilities past these admittedly painful references, the game play is actually quite fun, and the premise of the story being very loosely based off of history adds to the quality and cuteness of the game. The Pixelators add in their legal agreement language that the true goal of the game is to save people and not to make light of religion or beliefs. I played this game with that in mind, and - as strange as it sounds - reading this part of the agreement added more to the quality of the game play.<br /><br />The largest downside is the relative length of the game. It only took me a few days to pass all levels. To the Pixelators' credit, they made some levels nearly impossible to get three stars on and this creates more gaming for those of us who obsess over thoroughly beating the game. As you go along, you also unlock challenges that you can play from the main screen. These extra challenges and the prospect of trying to get three stars on everything actually seemed more stressful than fun but I am sure others will disagree. After three days, I have put the game down completely and will not replay it.<br /><br />Thankyou Pixelators for making an app that does what it is supposed to do, and thank you especially for not making me feel like I've just been used as a pawn on a profit board. You deserve success!
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Putting the music to the story brought it to life.  I reread the book just to put the music to it. I love the CD.
B005C0DHIK|5.0|Denial is the greatest problem we face, or don't face as a nation. How we can allow fracking and not be violently upset about the consequence of it is beyond me. Big business and greed will be our demise if we do not, collectively do something about this.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|not worth watching, fairly slow, action seens are weak, younger children may like the film more than I did (under 12 years)
B005HEJ2DK|4.0|I've seen and enjoyed everything &#34;Star Trek&#34; and although this crew isn't as good as TNG, they had a number of really great episodes.  I've seen these previously in HD and for some reason I found that the sharpness on this Amazon streaming not quite up to what I expected.  It fills the screen in 1:1.78 (16 x 9) format (i.e. - widescreen), but it was not as crisp as I know it can be.  None-the-less it's still quite good.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|This was just a lot of violent shoot-um-up.  No plot at all.  No storyline. Waste of time to watch this one.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|Josh Duhamels best movie yet!! Storyline was very gripping and entertaining. Ending was very surprising. One of my favorite Nicholas Spark stories.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|The story line was at times confusing because of the multiple locations and not realizing until very late in the movie that each story wasn't playing out linearly in time.  Having said that. The acting was superb and overall the complete story arc was very interesting.  I am still a bit baffled about the resolution of some of the threads, but I get the gist of where they were headed.
B00C1S945G|5.0|I've seen all of these episodes many times, however I've never seen them like this in HD.  It really makes a huge difference, especially if you're the type of person that is 'tuned in' visually.  The colors, clarity and even the sound as vastly better than any version of these episodes that you've ever seen before.
0425263924|4.0|I waited and waited just like every one else in the world for this book to come out, and finally, had a quiet evening to read it without interruption.  I personally like the two of them--two screwed up, extremely wealthy, sexy adults trying to work things out.  The needy mother, the just as screwy best friend, the former lovers, the past that won't let go.  I can understand why readers who expected a trilogy are disappointed, but then, there are two more books to look forward to, and this one does bring Gideon and Eva forward rather than continuing to let them simmer in their own miseries.  I do get confused at times with the writing and the timeline--which was a real problem in Reflected, but not quite as rough in Entwined.  And, I also sometimes think the vocabulary is limited to the point that it becomes repetitive rather than seductively luscious.  I'm not sure that I want to yawn through the sex while I'm reading it.  My question now is, \\"What else can go wrong for these two?\\"  It is the stuff that goes wrong that makes the story great, and there is an unsolved mystery to follow as well as a lot of trouble to get into on the West Coast.  Please don't keep us hanging as long with Books Four and Five, Sylvia.  I for one look forward to the balance of the series (and whatever Lionsgate chooses to do with this on the screen).
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a really great show that has a great cast. The storyline is always very good and intriguing I would definitely recommend the show.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|My baby absolutely love this jumper!! One of the best purchases we made so far. I just wish it has a mobile toy, that would make this jumper more interesting for my baby! But overall this is a great buy for parents who wants to have a few minutes of free time while baby plays.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Yes the goal of this extremely well made game is to let loose then guide a plague indirectly via evolving it is admittedly morbid. Then again no complaints are seen in reviews of war games about their levels of violence, as such reviewing this game with weight on it's premise is not fair to the title or those reading the reviews.<br /><br />That said, let us get down to &quot;brass tacks&quot;. This game is Five-Star in every possible criteria. The interface is intuitive and easy to literally master in minutes. Learning new types of plagues as you unlock them is again extremely intuitive, I say this in terms of the inherent strengths and weaknesses of said plague. The process of assigning genes you have unlocked is even self explanatory, and not a one time affair as you do unlock new ones not to mention different plagues gain more from some genes than others. Difficulty however is always right where you want it no matter what you have unlocked. Say you want to simply kill time in a waiting room go with the &quot;Casual&quot; setting should you want a mild challenge choose &quot;Normal&quot; and if you honestly want to give your intellect a solid workout go with the &quot;Brutal&quot; difficulty setting. Playing the harder two of the three difficulties does leave you with a sense of not only progress as it unlocks the next plague but as well there is a feeling of reward from earning genes you can insert into the base genetic template of your plague before the start of a game session. Also you can review your performance against that of not only the AI you are up against but as well your plague itself, yes the plague will evolve and change on itself, which depending on type of plague and current game status can be anywhere from good to bad or meaningless. No matter what difficulty or plague type there is a great amount happening at all times though it is very manageable so long as you do not speed up time on a &quot;Brutal&quot; difficulty game session and by the timeyou pop all the bubbles the cure is halfway done. Lastly there may be only one condition for winning a game session but there are two conditions for loss, one is a cure is developed and gets distributed and yes you can win with a cure developed so long as enough infrastructure has collapsed so that it may not be distributed and the second failure condition is your plague being too deadly and killing all hosts before the entire global population is infected. Balancing speed of infection with lethality really comes into play in the harder difficulties as well with the harder to manage plague types.<br /><br />In short this is an absolutely top notch strategy game that has managed to perfectly balance every single element from gameplay itself to the interface. This one truly is only as difficult as you make it. As well the replay value on this game is simply unparalleled, I find myself choosing a &quot;Bacterial&quot; based plague sometimes just for well nostalgia. I would have put spoiler alert on this review but there simply is nothing to spoil, the story IS the game's description and I never thought anyone could make such a rich detailed and complex gaming experience from a base of such simplicity.<br /><br />So do not pass over this one due to the concept as if you do which it seems too many have you will have robbed yourself of one of the finest strategy games ever made on any platform..
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I enjoyed it. I liked that there was more history, I would have liked more. The only issue I had was America's explosive knee-jerk reactions to things she has little to no information about. Not exactly endearing, and it makes it difficult to imagine any man besotted enough to put up with. I am also not a fan of love triangles, hopefully that goes away soon. All in all, though, it was still enjoyable. I am looking forward to the next book.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|We Loved watching this on Amazon and it's one of the BEST superhero movies!  We're planning on watching the third movie, soon!
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I was a Kanye stan, but this is garbage. I always listened to hip-hop and have listened to electronic for the past year or 2. None of the sounds Kanye brought were original and all of his lyrics were shit. Sorry Kanye, I gotta score you honestly.<br /><br />1/5
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved it. Couldn't put it down can't wait for the next one. The whole crossfire series was well worth reading
B000WS4PCO|5.0|The disc came in great condition, and the sound quality was wonderful. Not a single scratch on it! It runs wonderfully in my car's CD player.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This app is the best app on my kindle fire because when your on the go you need  some entertaining stuff
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is the best Marvel comics adaptations so far. I would Highly recommend this movie if you like this genre.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|An excellent read! I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's got everything...airplanes, computers, sex, suspense. Very tied into what's happening in today' world.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|The disc came in great condition, and the sound quality was wonderful. Not a single scratch on it! It runs wonderfully in my car's CD player.
B0090KZDSK|3.0|this book was ok but not much of a story in it and ended quite bad the first 2 in the serious were a better story
B00DAXXO98|5.0|For those who liked West Wing, you will love House of Cards.  Vice president-in-waiting, Kevin Spacey and Robin Wright as his wife, give compelling performances.  Discovered this show by accident, surfing the web.  Am so glad I did.
B00001ZT6Z|5.0|You know what? I hate people! THIS ALBUM IS GOOD! I know it might not sound like sabbath but just imagine it was another band, I DON'T KNOW. Buy it, listen to it, you won't be disappointed.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|The disc came in great condition, and the sound quality was wonderful. Not a single scratch on it! It runs wonderfully in my car's CD player.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Great book love the twist and turns!!! Can't wait to read the rest in the next book. Silvia Day is a wonderful author!!
B008YW5RH2|4.0|This is an entertaining game to pass time when I feel like playing. I don't play many games on my Kindle Fire, to be honest, but I downloaded this one because I enjoy getting out on the courts to play tennis--and love watching tennis. So, it looked like it'd be fun and a good fit to my style. The graphics are good, too.
B00CBRAD2A|5.0|Thought that it dealt with some real time problems that people in law enforcement have to deal with when it comes to enforceing the law
B002FRNCG0|5.0|The disc came in great condition, and the sound quality was wonderful. Not a single scratch on it! It runs wonderfully in my car's CD player.
B000FGGETU|5.0|This is one of the best Opeth albums ever!!! I don't think their is a dull moment on this album. This may be the drumming that Martin Lopez had recorded with Opeth especially on the title track, IT BLEW ME AWAY!!!!!<br />If you are an Opeth fan (casual or hardcore) this album is a must have.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I lobe this game. Its not too easy or too hard. I want more levels though. I could keep playing this all day.
B00CFQMVLS|5.0|It only shows what a country will do to get their way with people that break the bounds of justice.
B008220C38|4.0|The beauty of this film comes from the abilities of these amazing actors. Along with the stunning settings and costumes displayed in this movie. Keira Knightley is her usual beautiful self and has proven to be a dynamic leading lady, but this film really belongs to Jude Law. He has finally let go of the pretty boy image and it was astonishing. He is phenomenal. His performance along with standout performances from Matthew McFayden and Domhnall Gleeson made this film worth watching. Any scene Matthew is in is joyous and wonderful. Domhnall, who's father is the great Brendon Gleeson, really is a revelation. His portrayal of Levin is beautiful and emotional and heartbreaking. You really feel everything he does. His journey to true love is the reason for watching this film. That is the true love story behind this film. Th  reason for hope. The reason for belief. And the belief in happily ever after. Truly stunning. The look of the film is magical. From costumes to sets to the style  in which it was shot, just beautiful. Really, a must watch.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very drawn in by this intriguing story, though I do not often read scifi.  I'm glad I took a friend's recommendation!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Paced to keep your attention and interest. Intriguing idea of the power of government and the ignorance of the populace to follow the rules and conform.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is an overall good app. However, I have come across two problems. 1: The way the tilt option is made is weird. It makes it so you have to sit up to play, you cant lean back. 2: It is really hard to get coins. when you are getting up to like the tiger shark and it costs 15,000 coins, it takes forever to get that much. I can only imagine how much the great white costs.
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I am glad (for now at least) that I didn't go by the bad reviews for this app.  Everything is up and running fine for me. I really don't use calendars online that much.  I only signed up for the google calendar because is was required for this app.  I basically only wanted a simple calendar app on my Kindle Fire.  But the free apps seems subpar and did little too nothing.  So I paid the 5.99 with my fingers crossed.  So far I really like the app.  It seems to do much more than what I need it for.  If anything happens I will post it!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I like this book for many reasons.  Probably the foremost being its complete originality.  I liked this book so much I picked up the next one in the series - but have been having troubles getting started.
B009NY43NY|5.0|In spite of the reviews that didn't care for the end, I thought the way she ended the series was well thought out and pleasant.  Who knows, there could even be an &#34;update&#34; book several years down the road and not have to reinvent things.
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I got this because I couldn't find candy crush&hellip;and i'm glad I found this. Very addictive game!!! Easy to catch on to. Can easily spend hours playing this game.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a challenging game that requires you to think outside the box and its interesting. at first it can be a bit confusing, but after a few levels you get the hang of it.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|But I am still mad at Harriet for holding back on the ebook so long - assuming she was responsible for the delay decision. Still feel snubbed by that. Speaking for myself, I will never buy paper books again. My library now comes with me when I go anywhere. Get used to it.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|I bought this so I could charge my phone via solar.<br />HOWEVER, the cable/wire that came with the charger does not fit my phone!<br />The wire has USB connection on one end (plugs into the charger) and the other tip (that would go into your Android or digital Camera or . . . ?) is TOO BIG.<br />Some long time ago, I purchased what was billed as an adapter that could handle various plug-in tips for this very problem.<br />Even THAT turned out to be not true.<br />WTH am I supposed to do with this? Not going to get a different phone, just so it will fit the plug!<br />ALSO, the directions are in infinitesimally small print. Seriously, had to use a magnifying glass to read it. Nothing about different sizes of plug/tips.<br />Can the seller give me info re: getting the proper wire???
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Each season seems to outdo the one before.  The series is simply the best we've viewed over many years.  I cant decide whether to watch one episode each sitting, or as many as I can squeeze in.  I can't recommend it too highly.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|Fun and easy for all ages.  Get creative or design appropriate looks for different occasions.  My kids challenged each other to create looks to a setting another described and then the girls voted if the look would work.  Lots of giggling.
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|If you enjoy Family Guy/American Dad humor, you will like it guaranteed. A feel-good buddy type movie. Thank you for reading.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book both for the story and the insight it provided into the Second World War and those who fought.
B002IEVZFK|5.0|This is a really passionate song. This is what I look for in a Metal Song. The guitar riffs are excellent and among the best I've ever heard.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is pretty fun and I love to play whenever I get bored plus I am ways encouraged to beat no.e or other people's score
B000I8HIR2|4.0|Sent instantly to my Xbox, the movie was great. Not super scary but had some weird characters to be scary like pyramid head and the creepy nurses. Then ending makes you think.
B00CRS88IO|5.0|If you like fast-paced stories filled with danger, memorable characters and a little romance....you'll like this book.<br /><br />Hold onto your seat, for this ride includes perilous airplane, boat and car chases, as well as a chilling ski chase that can freeze your heart with fear.<br /><br />Author Damian Stevenson weaves authentic details from Ian Fleming's life as a British Secret Agent throughout this tale.<br /><br />Set in the 1940s, as the Nazi's were stomping across Europe, determined to rule the world, both the British and the Germans set their sites on the French naval fleet, determined to secure it and, thus, assure their wartime naval dominance.<br /><br />In \\"The Ian Flemming Files: Operation Armada,\\" Flemming is given four days to secure the fleet for Great Britain. His life and the future of his nation are on the line.<br /><br />And like 007 in a James Bond thriller, Flemming's assignment is packed with danger, intrigue, and clever weapons including poisonous cigarettes and shoe laces embedded with deadly blades.<br /><br />Aside from the twists and turns of this thriller, I was taken by the author's often-clever asides. For example: \\"meeting with his inner circle, which, would be better described as an isosceles triangle, with him at the vertex...\\"<br /><br />Another pleasant surprise is his almost poetic use of scenic description. For example: \\"a kaleidoscope of finches chirped in the treetops...\\"<br /><br />He even gives a clever nod to Tom Wolfe and another to Graham Green (two authors whose work I admire).<br /><br />So, if you want a good read for the summer, I suggest \\"The Ian Flemming Files: Operation Armada.\\"
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Can't believe they cancelled this! Jack is great even this late in the game. Loved the entire series, and they even ended on a high note.
B008HJGPVO|2.0|It works like most others, I guess. But the cap won't stay on, so it's really quite useless to me. I didn't much care for the one that came with the Kindle, until I got this one. Now I like the original much better.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|It's been a while since a book has made me intensely emotional.  Storytelling with style and talent that challenges.  Highly recommended.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|THIS IS THE BESTESTESTEST SHOW EVER. I love is so much. I watch it over & over again. it's so amazing.
B000ICZD5M|5.0|Epic adventure through time.  I learn something new every time I watch this movie.  Many things in history and religion can be related to the story line.  In many cases, I learned it here first. Now that's a quality that's not immediately apparent, but intuitively appealing.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The origin story for any super hero is always layered. This retelling of the Green Arrow's has just that. I look forward to see where they go with the plot next season.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a very good version.  I Really like the many versions of the bible and the audio part but I would like audio with the Amplefied and New King James Versions.  I highly recommend this app to everyone.
B003GERM08|1.0|It was a horrible though I appreciated the movie be in good condition it was only one disc when I order a 2 disk set
B004SOR4H6|5.0|If you're into Twitter this is a good app and for me I don't have data on my phone so this is a good option for me.
B00DC7NNAC|1.0|I am so sorry we paid for this movie and only watched 20 minutes. The script was horrible. I am really sorry to waste the money on this junk. It could have been a good movie with the cast they had but it was not at all.<br /><br />Carrie<br />NH
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|If you are looking for a good tear-jerking love story, you've found it!  Excellent coming of age story that caused us to start it over as soon as we finished watching the first time. Then we ran it again two weeks later.  If you like Nicholas Sparks' work, you will be pleased with this work.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Definitely a slight challenge with each room getting a little trickier. Definitely not so hard you can't complete the levels. Need more rooms!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Do you really need a review of Angry birds?  I've yet to play one I didn't like.  One more on my list of angry birds I love.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I didn't have very high expectations when I sat down to watch this movie.  I was very pleasantly surprised!  There was a strong solid story line and an enormous amount of talent!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love, love, love this game.  But only when I can load it and play it.  I hope this problem of Kindle users not being able to load the game after the new update can be fixed, because I just bred a Rainbow dragon and I don't want to lose my game.  Please fix this as quickly as possible.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a awesome game you should really great it you won't be sorry<br />When you get it!!get it now
B000YEU1EW|5.0|Done watching Wizard of Oz every thanksgiving?  This makes a great substitute in our family.  What's not to like about it as it checks off all the boxes for all sci fi fans.<br /><br />If you every watched old time weekly serials this will send those fond memories crashing through your mind by this 21st century homage to film classics.<br /><br />F
B0086DBE62|3.0|We liked this movie overall... adaptation of the fairy tale theme.  I would say that it was not as exciting as expected though given the higher caliber cast.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a little mystery. It also shows you how life doesn't always turn out as we think it should. Great work Matthew Quick!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is absolutely wonderful! Every teen should read this... it is now my new favorite book!! I loved every bit of it
B0076DELIG|4.0|Don't take this book too seriously, but if you like Harry Bosch, you will enjoy this read.  It is a fun summer read.
B004PLT3TY|3.0|not our favorite movie, though the kids seemed to like it.  All in all an okay movie to watch once.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I play it every day it is so awesome it is very addicting and I love all the games on it.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins has never failed to deliver such a thrill ride a reader wants and needs. This is now my favorite Sigma novel, and I can't wait for the next! Such strong characters, and such a mesmerising plot. I actually like the bad guys too, and I think (with an incredible director) this would make a marvellous movie. FIVE STARS!!!!!
B002QB1910|3.0|I bought this as a gift and found some of it great.  You must be a Rihanna fan to appreciate all of her changing sounds.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The plot, the sub-plots and the actors are all excellent!  I definitely recommend this to all my friends and family.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Don't waste your time installing this app. It didn't work, and I am still unable to use the adobe flash player.
B005NACYQU|5.0|Quite inexplicably, this is the first Gaiman book that I've read and quite quickly realised that I'm going to become an avid fan. The story itself is in equal parts beautiful and gory, with such a intricate and well thought out storyline the likes of which I haven't encountered for quite some time.<br /><br />There are a few twists and turns in the book which kept me utterly enraptured, however this could just be my 'style' of reading. I prefer to let the story take its own course rather than try to guess what's coming up. Perhaps others who prefer to puzzle out what's coming up next won't be quite as captivated as I was.<br /><br />Every now and then - very rarely - you read a book or see a film and as you turn the last page or watch the credits roll, you get that weird sort of feeling and think to yourself, 'I think that just changed my life'. It hasn't, of course. Not really. However the protagonist in American Gods will, I think, follow me in the back of my mind for some time. Quite apt, I think, that Gaiman chose to name him Shadow.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a fun game. Easy at first, then gets progressively more difficult. Stimulates the mind. A refreshing change of pace. Addictive
B002EMESSM|4.0|To have the oportunity to try it was a great experience and I recommended to anybody that is looking for something good.
B00C061I3K|3.0|Well I give it threes stars because its a new Daft Punk album...but I give it three stars beacause it's not that great of an album. About 3 songs on here i contniue to listen too. The rest are just meh....
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|It took me at least 45 minutes to really get into this one.  Once I got into it, I did enjoy it.  I didn't know much about the story line, so unfortunately, I was expecting something along the lines of The Wizard of Oz classic and found it nothing like the original classic.  Overall, I did like it.
B009LA1R34|5.0|It was really great. Music was right on and loved the duets on the CD.  Best CD she's made. Great
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is so cool that it is the best free game.<br /><br />This is the best action game ever<br /><br />Iruufbrhrrhrhudhddhehehe r e e w seed err err Reese reed refurbishment h urufhfhrhrhfyrhhrrbbrbrbrbebrhrhrbrbrhrhehebebehehehehejrudjdjdhhdhfhfhfhdhddhfhdhddhdhdhdhdhdhhdhdhdhdududududuu
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Can't wait for the next one! She is an amazing romance writer. Love the interaction between Ace and Angel and all of the other supporting characters.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|Not as unwatchable as expected, but still pretty much great chunks of purple & green pixels whaling on great chunks of black & silver ones, with occasional pauses for the pixels to catch their breath.  Scarlett Johansen can act.  And I think Iron Man's suit had some expressive moments.  I would have liked to have seen Joel Gray as Loki.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was an excellent description of combat.Described in vivid detail are the experiences of pilots on bothy sides of the conflict.
B003Y059EK|3.0|It tried to reach the match buut did not make it...whats up with the chicken amy way? that part was odd also
B00280LYIC|5.0|My son loved this book.  It was a great mix of a new story with old Greek mythology thrown in.  This was one of the first books that actually started my son actually wanting to read chapter books.
B004KBSQOW|2.0|Popular songs are good..there is only two..the others do not match my taste in music..  Wish there was an opportunity to preview songs before purchasing.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|Introductory chapter of a probably okay book on HTML-5:<br /><br />You pay approximately five bucks for the rest of the book.<br /><br />If this one chapter be any indication, then the book would probably be an okay, albeit run-the-mill book.<br /><br />By the way, this chapter describes what to expect from HTML-5, not any examples of HTML-5 coding, basically an incentive to sell the rest of the book, which is currently (late June /early July 2013) being sold for about five (5) dollars for each electronic copy.<br /><br />It's okay, no complaints but no accolades either.
B008YRVW0I|3.0|As I said before these games rely too much on Facebook and real money.  Where are the games we can just play and earn money (play money)?  I won't play this until changes are made.<br /><br />I don't know what to say about this game.  Seems like we need more instructions with these games.  We need to have explicit instruction during playing these games too.
B000K2LB7O|5.0|This has been one of my favorite movies since I first saw it on the Old Movie Channel!  I Love Irene Dunne and I love Randolph.....<br />Fred and Ginger are there too, dancing and romancing away as usual..  Great Movie!

B006FE83UE|5.0|Probably one of the best movies ever made.  It tells a story that was long overdue for the telling.  Everybody in it is wonderful and the story is one that needed to be told.  I think it worked as an eye opener to issues about racial relations and what kids live with growing up in the South!  Gregory Peck is fantastic as always.  This movie will live forever!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|THE WORLD PLAY FOR THIS BOOK IS GREAT! READING IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE I WAS IN THE ACTUAL GAMES MYSELF! COULDN'T STOP READING CAN'T WAIT TO CONTINUE ON THE ON THE JOURNEY WITH THE 2&3 BOOK

B000IKQMFO|5.0|This is a favorite movie.  It brought back the wonderful stories like Downtown Abbey.  Of course Maggie Smith in ANY movie is a winner for me!  LOVE IT!
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|Can't wait to discuss this w others. One of the better dystopian stories I've read recently. I highly recommend it.
B00933JL0A|3.0|As I said before these games rely too much on Facebook and real money.  Where are the games we can just play and earn money (play money)?  I won't play this until changes are made.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The main characters were interesting, and the background was intriguing, but I felt the storyline was fairly predictable.  There we're a few situations that held my interest to the point that I wanted to keep reading, but for the most part I didn't have a problem putting the book down.  It was not a book that held my interest to the point that I didn't want to stop reading....Not a bad read, just not as compelling as I had hoped it would be.<br />I think it would be good read for a younger person, someone that is just beginning to have an interest in exploring the world of literature.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is so much easier than the ds. game I love it cant get enough.its tons more fun thatt other games.
B0088O11NU|3.0|I don't know what to say about this game.  Seems like we need more instructions with these games.  We need to have explicit instruction during playing these games too.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|Right price.  Does what it claims to do.  I recommend a color other than black so it doesn't get lost among all the other things in your purse or briefcase that come in black.
B002VISNLC|5.0|i love this book. my cousins recommended this to me and i really love it. all the danger the kid gets into because of these witches gets you excited!!! so now i highly recommend to you :) please get this book. thank you...

0061950726|5.0|&#34;Orphan Train:  A Novel&#34; was a great read, sad but in many ways so rewarding.  It didn't hurt that my dad had a friend who had come to the Midwest on an orphan train, back in the early 1900's.  The characters in this novel are likable, believable, and the story, while fiction, has a historical basis.  Loved it.

B00BQI4AU6|5.0|Tom Keifer never disappoints! The cd is an amazing collection of Tom's greatness! I hope he comes out with more great music.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|First off I'd like to start out by say that the mouse that I received from Anker had been opened prior to me receiving it. The \\"seal\\" that was over the top of the box had been peeled back and stuck to the back of the box, as well as the mouse having surface damage to the plastic between the DPI indicator and the left mouse button, cosmetic damage but for a new product you expect this to not be an issue. One of the feet on the bottom of the mouse was also peeled back and required reattachment. It doesn't stay properly in place as the adhesive appears to be faulty.<br /><br />Now for the actual performance of the product.<br />Lets start with the Pros<br />*Very affordable<br />*Visually its an appealing mouse<br />*Accurate laser very nice tracking<br />*Good click response from the mouse buttons<br />*Lightweight, and easy smooth motion<br /><br />And now the Cons<br />*The thumb \\"grip\\" is very slick, it gives no traction what so ever on the mouse<br />*The rear thumb button is way to far down and back and is constantly activated when you're trying to use the mouse<br />*Mouse doesn't have a very good feel in the hand, possibly due to the \\"glossy\\" coating on the right and left sides<br />*Scroll Wheel is too far back and not easy to use<br />*Weighting system leaves quite a bit to be desired. Is very cheaply made with only a small ring of foam holding the weights in (not to mention the weights I received had surface rust on them)<br />*DPI changing is a pain due to the fact that there isn't an \\"up and down\\" but only 1 button that you have to cycle through if you've already passed the DPI you want, a separate up and down would be very helpful here.<br />*The software is very clunky. Allows you to save profiles but you can't have them automatically load when you open up certain games like you can with other higher end mice.<br />*While its more of a personal choice the mouse feels more narrow than I had hoped it would be.<br /><br />Overall I'm pretty disappointed with the product from the compromised packaging and resulting damage to the product (poor quality control) to the poor materials used in constructing this mouse. I had very high hopes considering the affordable price point and after reading the glowing reviews for this product, I'm wondering how many of these reviewers are actually gaming with the mouse as opposed to just day to day use. If I had it to do all over again I wouldn't have tried to save a buck and would have just went for a higher end product with a more known name. Needless to say I'll be going back to my old reliable Logitech G5 and chock this one up to a lesson learned and 40 bucks down the drain. Probably be looking at some of the options in the Logitech or Razor lineup.<br /><br />*Edit* I received an email from Anker expressing their willingness to refund my money for this product. As I had already returned the mouse they also offered to send me a different mouse from their lineup which I accepted as several of the issues were from the compromised packaging. While I still can't give this 5 stars, the fact that this company has 5 star customer service in my book is enough to go from 2 stars to 3 stars. I look forward to trying a different mouse from their lineup and hope that this mouse can bring forth the quality that their customer service does.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This was a fantastic read. It is very hard to put this down! If you haven't read this series it is amazing stuff.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|There was a lot of hype about this book as a result of the movie.  Couldn't get the movie on Netflix so I bought the book and am glad I did.  It was a moving and funny read - well written.  If you like the book, forget the movie - they changed huge swaths of the story line.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I have played. It is sort of like temple run but you don't have to tilt the screen to get coins. As I said before this is one of the best games I have played!
B008OOYALE|5.0|I haven't played very long, but so far I like the graphics and the general aspect of the game. It seems to be pretty laid back.
B001CDZZI6|5.0|Not only does this assessment &#34;give you permission&#34; to be yourself, but the ideas for action section is great to encourage you to be your best self. This tool fosters an understanding of how to work with others of differing strengths, and it gives tips on how to communicate with others who may not intuitively &#34;get&#34; you. I've already had my high school-aged son take it as well as part of career planning. Strongly recommend for everyone.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Good but ot as good as the SHADES OF GRAY. It seems like she is trying to imitate. REPEAT! REPEAT!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I like this up very much. I use a couple sounds together and its just like falling asleep to a rainy night. I get insomnia now and then and was hoping this would help.  I'm pleasantly surprised. It also drowns out my noisy neighbors when they get loud.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Well acted from start to finish. Good portrayal of mental illness in pretty average circumstances. I would watch this movie again.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This is a fun game but it is hard to catch up to the players with all the items and bonuses. This can make the game frustrating if you are just starting out.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|I recommend this to any fan of hip hop. He switches his style up very well on this record. Makings of a classic
B009CGDERO|5.0|Easily, hands down, my favorite all time scifi tv series. I can't begin to describe my level of disappointment when Fox in their infinite stupidity canceled the series. You can't do any better than space cowboys, smuggling, evil empire, space zombies, oh my, need i go on? The cast was each perfectly cast, with the strong lead of the captain. Just absolutely the perfect formula. If you haven't seen this wrapping up  movie, your missing out!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|First, let me recommend that you read the first two Crossfire novels before attacking this one, for a better understanding of the many characters.  Then, let me recommend that you be prepared to look for book #4 (not yet published), then book #5!  These novels are well-written and actually have a real story (unlike some other novels which will remain nameless).  I read &#34;Entwined&#34; to discover answers to things  left  &#34;hanging&#34; in #1 and #2.  I still don't have the answers.

071267067X|5.0|I bought these cards especially because an amazon reviewer stated that these ones would not have \\"1971 USGames\\" printed on the front. You can imagine the dismay I felt, after buying them from England and having to wait an extra two weeks for them (over Christmas), when the cards arrived logo and all! Of course the logo dogged me for several days. Now 7 months later, I have, had. forgotten about the silly writing that has no place on tarot cards.<br />  I like these cards. I did straight away. They replaced my old Rider Waite pack which were pretty grotty and faded. The colors on these are vibrant and warm. They immediately felt good in my hands. It took me a month or two to actually give up my old set, and claim these as my cards. I would continue to read with the older pack and would just shuffle these for a while. But now I just like these ones. They are sturdy, attractive, and tough enough. I use them every day, and I can be pretty rough on my stuff.

B00005YW4H|5.0|Like most folks this is the cd that introduced me to Norah Jones. My original disc was damaged and this is a replacement. If you had to describe this work of art in one word it would be sublime. Holy cow. What a gift. It is still one of my favorite cd's to listen to and I can't imagine ever tiring of it.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|Gruesome at times, creepy always. It's a great show exploring the events leading up to Silence of the Lambs. Great character development and Mads is perfect as Hannibal.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I loves all of the books in this series. I am watching the DVDs now, which are completely different characters and stories, but Sookie seems pretty close. I enjoyed all the characters in this series, and what can you expect of a vampire anyway. I enjoyed the ending. Good must always concur evil.
B0006AAS5G|4.0|A bargain and I've received compliments on it.  No Rolex, but I'll wear it for dress up occasions as well as at work.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Often feel that there are too many, some exaggerated.....photos that are photoshopped and not real. Public postings when individuals request privacy, outdated comments added to current postings.  Love connecting with people from my past as well as word games. Forgot to mention those that feel a need to post and photograph their daily meals, measly gardening accomplishments as well as their daily routines as though it were a train schedule we needed to get somewhere important. Who cares?  Do they ever ask themselves that?
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|Have thoroughly enjoyed the first season and look forward to what will occur next season.  Loved the ending, even.....makes you even more curious what will happen!  I like that it takes the same Hannibal premise and expands with different characters, so it does not revolve centrally around Hannibal's characters actions alone.  Sure hope they keep the same writers and producers to make this one of the top 10 TV series.  If you even liked one of the other Hannibal movies, you need to see this series, and keep an open mind that it is different, but in a VERY good way!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This book made me laugh out loud,cry and cheer for these characters at the same time. This is such a strange but wonderful kind of book. I will never forget this book, it's that good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great game very authentic. Would like to be able to meet more friends. Wish it were easier to get more horses.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Ive been waiting for some time to purchase this latest album by my  favorite group.,  Thank you for rushing the delivery to me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I think this is a good workout for the brain. I highly recommend this game for us brains. Keeps you on your toes.
B000002KE2|5.0|Lost this album years ago and couldn't find it on iTunes, or any of the Ozzy/Sabbath back collection, and was blown away all over again. Supernaut and Snowblind just rock.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|this movie is brillant and worth watching.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys films because this one will take your breath away
B00AREIAI8|3.0|good but could use more clear cut directions and needs a way around the friends requirement . still a lot of fun once you figure the game out
B005GFPZYK|5.0|An in depth look at a true American Hero! Chris was the kind of man that this country needs alot more of, understand what drives him to be all that he can be. He will be truly missed!
1558908382|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  I saw it a dozen times in the theater, watched it dozens more times on videocassette and now on DVD too!
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game but don't get a reward for playing daily. But keeps me entertained for a while. I don't know what else to say loads fast for me.
B0063M22QO|3.0|It's not as great as the Mahjong Deluxe.  I'm on a Tower which is easy to play but can only get to 112 tiles.  Is that it?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved the story line.  Would recommend it to anyone who reads erotic romance stories.  I unfortunately don't enjoy her books relating to the old English era - too many words not understood by me.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Mahjong Deluxe is good because of more than one game played at a time!  Faster, keeps you on your feet!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Very interesting piece of work! This game is challenging, only because finding the objects to escape the floor is kinda hard.I like this game either way. It's really addictive once you get the hang of it.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Since we don't have this app on the Play store for Vizio Co-Star Google TV, I installed the Amazon version. A tad sluggish but all elements seem to work well.
0143039482|5.0|As a huge fan of Steinbeck &#34;Winter&#34; is right up there with all the rest of his lifetime's worth of good classics.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|The author talks about his NDE and claims that his neocortex was dead during the NDE so it could not be an illusion of his brain.<br />Well written and inspiring but only a little information is given about the afterlife.
B00821OX98|5.0|The set designs, effects and story lines all come together to create a wonderful human drama in the midst of an alien invasion.
B000FC1KBG|5.0|After a few days of the &#34;witching hour&#34; with my 5 week old, I downloaded this on my kindle.  Tracey Hogg had great insight to help me understand why my little one was screaming every day at 5pm and literally, the next day, we were able to help soothe him back to sleep with very little crying!  I have also read baby wise and used that eat play sleep principle-  however, the cry it out strategy did not work for us.  I love that Baby Whispered has specific trouble shooting tips and strategies.  Everyone comments on how well behaved our little one is and I feel I should thank this book!  tihave recommended this to all of my mommy friends!!
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love how this app allows me to choose the number of pieces as well as whether or not the pieces to be rotated.  I like doing puzzles and it is something  I can do whenever I have a moment.  The puzzles are also saves, you just have to remember the way you started it.  Number of pieces and piece rotation ans such.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Great movie for all ages. It's a fun family movie as well. The actors fit the characters. I greatly recommend it.
B0091UGEVY|5.0|I really loved this movie and so did my family. It was funny and charming. Julia was a great evil queen. The dwarves were lol funny too.
B005AV93JI|5.0|Have read it a million times! Great read! Great one if you like adventure & travelling. Inspiring. Definitely a must read.
B0050Q3UEM|5.0|The ABSOLUTE BEST STREAMING SITE FOR ANY ONE WITH ANY KIND OF APPRECIATION OF ANY KIND OF ELECTRONICA MUSIC.....Me - My favorite s Euro Trance - the station with the weirdly colored green animated drum player....There is nothing else on the web that even approaches the driving hard power of this station.....Only downfall is, no equalizer and no graphics....I stream the station through WinAmp, and use their equalizer - SKA, and open up the cool graphic visualizations. Can only do this on pc or mac though - not with the Android or Kindle apps....Try this combo - you'll love it.
B000QDA7OU|3.0|Being a fan of Audrey Hepburn, led me to this movie. The ending leaves you with an empty feeling. The acting was excellent, and she deserves the recognition she received for that role. Recommended  for Audrey Hepburn fans.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Hesitated seeing it because I thought it was for the YOUNGUN but its for the young of heart..I loved it
B001AR44MW|5.0|Keeps your interest from beginning to end.  Very enjoyable!!!  Harrison Ford is always exceptional and he did not disappointment in this movie.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Love the good wife. Can't wait til season 4 is available to watch for free. It's a great show but I'm not going to pay extra to watch.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Intrigued as I was with the success of Game of Thrones on TV, I always try to read the source material first. A Game of Thrones does not disappoint. Intricate plot, fascinating characters, and conflicts both big and small. I cannot wait to read the next book.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Definitely disappointed with how this book ended. However I enjoyed the book enough that I will purchase the next one I just hope the author gets her stuff together and ends it with the next book.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|great fun; lots of animals.  the game never gets old.  new challenges every day.  Keep the animals coming.  great work.
B0080MJYR0|2.0|First, I think this was rated PG.  Parents, be warned, that's not accurate.  It's a strong PG-13 and should have a warning stating &#34;partial nudity&#34;.  However, it's unlikely parents would be interested in this very much anyway and certainly not be considering it for family viewing.  Going on... the props are ridiculous and special effects very amateurish.  The plot is.... well, if you find one let me know.  My wife and I viewed this together at my choosing thinking I've never seen this movie I've heard about for decades.  Now my curiosity is satisfied and my conclusion is it wasn't worth the time viewing it.  We consider it to be a comedy or a joke, not sure which, but not worthwhile.  I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 just because I guess it still fits into the category of a timeless (why?) old cult classic, an early Jane Fonda movie.  There are far better ways of spending your time!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great fun. have watched this more than once. I'm sure we will see a sequel or more some day. I hope Robert Downey Jr. sticks around.
1452115567|5.0|This is just a fun book. I really like it. What a cool story as well. I have it at the salon so clients can look through it and anyone who looks at it likes it alot.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|Usually I love Jamie Fox and actually his acting is not bad. I just did not like the movie. Unfortunately I did not know who the producer was (Tarantino) until the start of the movie when the credits rolled . If you enjoy his type of movie this one will be right up your alley, me I'd like my money back. Sorry Jaime.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After reading the Wall Street Journal article about this book and author, I couldn't wait to download it to my Kindle.  It did not disappoint.  Unique setting and story made it compelling and something I looked forward to reading everyday until I finished it.  Had I been on a desert island I would  have read it straight through.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Hurry up for season 3 to be available on Amazon! The show is well acted but brutal. Not for children.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|I loved pearl jam and I heard that Eddie Vedder had released some solo albums, then I saw this one Ukulele Songs. I Was A Little Hesitant At First But The First Night I Listened To It For Bout 2 Hours. It's Absolutely Beautiful. His Vocals Are Enchanting. It's Crazy How One Person And A Ukulele Can Make Such An Amazing Sound. It's The Best Album I've Heard Since Johnny Cash When The Man Comes Around. I Recommend It For Anyone Who Wants To Hear Amazing Vocals And Song Writing Masterpiece :) its 5 out of 5 in My Opinion.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It was easy and fast to download and it gave us the light we needed to see in an emergency.  We were eating at a restaurant at the beach when the power went out due to a thunderstorm!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although very sexual, this book is surprisingly very, very good. A book i would highly recommend to a person who is into mystery romance.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Trying to find yourself? This book author did it in a very unique way. I wish I had her courage!!
0061438294|5.0|This book has open my eyes to be more aware of body language. I believe a lot of times we are on auto pilot in life. And we miss a lot of information. As well as believe that you learn the most from talking and listening in life. What every body is sayings opens your eyes to a whole other world of learning and that's through non verbal communication.  The author did a good job of breaking down the different body language signals. But also explains that it takes time to get good at it. And that you maybe right half the time he explains that other factors can play into it. Such as how well do you know the person some body language for one person could be totally different for the next. But overall its a cool book you will get a kick out of how much you will see in the world now once you start applying this knowledge to your everyday life.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|It is a very very good product. I would highly recom. This to any one needing a place to shop
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book was so good that I would enjoy that the most important thing in the book was when Dorothy got home to aunt Em.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Just what I needed to replace an old fb on another system..  so, if you like fb you love this app
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Such a great theme upon which to build a story of personal growth and triumph.  I will always think about the symbolism of each flower from this point forward.  I love the connection of the modern world to a simpler more beautiful time. Or was it?  Very enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its pretty fun. the only thing that hugged me is that on my kindlefire u cant put numbers in ur user. otherwise its a fun game
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|Found the subject matter juvenile and not what I want to do with my time.  Did not like the writing style either.
B00511ONPG|1.0|I imagine he was paid by Facebook, because he was just so overly enthusiastic about it. The book is short but still needed to fill up space so it says the same thing in different ways over and over. Also really annoyed with how he villified traditional marketing. I'm not saying there's nothing to learn from this book but please, look for other options to learn this stuff.
B00452VF4O|5.0|I stayed up many nights devouring these stories.  The historical references were compelling and the story lines were epic.  Loved these books.
B00BBW15R8|5.0|If you want to laugh,smile and feel joy this is the movie for you. I've seen it twice now and laughed just as hard the second time. The dialogue is perfect.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Exceptional story telling.  Jaimie and Claire are my icons of lovers who are forever joined in time and souls.  Ahhhhh
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have read the trilogy so many times but the 2nd and 3rd one are my favorite I couldn't stop reading until I was done
B003XYERRM|5.0|I loved the development of this character.  Many faceted personality at once tortured and shaped by family blood lines and responsibilities to the kingdoms and alliances.  Rather fascinating and quite absorbing historical fiction.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I've read all the reviews and I can understand why some people are upset.  Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher?!  If you've never read the books you won't understand, however, Tom Cruise pulls it off very well.  Even for a short guy.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Time travel has always intrigued me.  For whatever reason, this series is completely engaging and wonderful.  A must read series.  The time periods are quite intriguing.
B003PIS6GO|5.0|This was one of my favorite movies as a kid.  I watched it whenever I saw it on TV and hadn't seen it in years.  I found it here as a Prime Instant Movie and was watching it in minutes.  I still love it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the funnies rhe funnest th amazing  ist i cant stop playing it it is so funny and fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game and and you get to play as such characters as Jake,Tricky and DJ Fresh I wonder if everyone likes this game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I heard about Wool on NPR or the podcast Spaceship Sofa (I think). It sounded interesting, and buying it would support an independent writer, and -- I admit it -- it was cheap.<br />You know what? Wool is refreshing and new and just plain awesome. The plot, the characters, the descriptions all work together to create a story that keeps you pondering after it's done.<br />My only complaint? It ended too soon. Keep writing, Mr. Howey!  I can't wait!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I'm really in love with it. Suzanne Collins is an amazing author that can go from making you laugh so hard to crying the hardest you ever had in the change of a paragraph. She had my heart hooked on the series ever since I read the words \\" When I wake up the other side of my bed is cold.\\" From the original book of the best series of books I have ever had the pleasure of reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|ITS A GOOD LEARNING PROCESS OF TREATING  A HORSE AND TAKING CARE OF A HORSE. IT MAKE ME WANNA HAVE A HORSE AS A PET,BUT I CAN'T.:(
B005T87QCI|5.0|You have to be really aware of the fights<br />Or you'll be beaten and it won't be pretty.this is just a heads up.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|If you like the Big Bang Theory, you will enjoy this show. Well cast with enough humor to keep even non scify fans entertained.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good action adventure movie with some humor thrown in to boot.  Definitely worth seeing.  Star studded cast returns this summer for the sequel.
B000MV90F8|5.0|We love the movie with Gregory Peck and found it interesting to see where the book set the record straight.  Italian names and places are not familiar, so a bit hard to keep all straight, but well worth the read.  Highly recommend.
B009NX3TB2|2.0|I don't mind this movie being &#34;out there&#34; a bit... it just got tedious being &#34;out there&#34; for &#34;out there's&#34; sake. As always with Thomas Newman, the music was amazing!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Escape: Camp 14 provides insight into a society we no so little about! The concentration-style camps of WWII still exist today in North Korea.
B00AF6B22E|4.0|The movie moved well and kept me interested.  Denzel's struggle with the truth, his conscience, and his alcohol problem all seems very real and believable.  His climactic decision is acting magic.
B000002O4X|5.0|This is the stuff dreams are made of. Were I a composer, I would write nothing but this inspiring, soaring, lilting, expectant music.
B004DTLK62|5.0|One of the all-time great biographic movies that I have had the pleasure of seeing!  Robert Downey Jr. IS Chaplin.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is  a great game makes you think a lot.put a lot of knowledge into the game its very addicted it feels like you are in a mission you are the star you gotta try your best to escape give it a try you will love the game . Me personally was getting frustrate d but once you get experience much easier to get addicted it to it qnd the most important its free
B00AHTYGRW|4.0|Argo is a very entertaining film that takes an actual historic event and makes it Hollywood enough to sell tickets and DVD's.  I looked up the real History and although it was a risky and daring rescue, there was no last minute, shooting, chase down the runway!
B009Y6UCRC|4.0|Very good, but not great. The best work was the covers. I am a big fan of Joe and think he is a great musician. Beth is good, Etta, KoKo, and Janis were great.
B000I9U9A4|4.0|Taken from the Aubrey-Maturin tales of author Patrick O'Brian, this film focuses on the Captain and crew of the H.M.S. Surprise, based on the captured (and renamed) french corvette of the same name.<br /><br />Set during the Napoleonic Wars, the film does an excellent job of portraying naval life and strategy of the early 19th Century, including the harsh conditions and to a degree the brutal discipline that typified the Royal Navy of that period.  Crowe plays the dashing Captain &#34;Lucky Jack&#34; Aubrey, loved and admired by his crew for his compassion, daring, and bravery and is counterbalanced by his close friend and ship's surgeon Dr. Stephen Maturin, played by Paul Bettany.  It is their friendship, and their ensuing personal conversations throughout many scenes in the film that provide most of the depth and internal struggles of these main characters as moving subplots to what is mostly a military drama.<br /><br />Focusing on the cat and mouse sea chase between the much larger and heavily armed/armored French Frigate Acheron, and the smaller lighter H.M.S. Surprise, the film also sheds light on a world before Darwin, when most of the known world had yet to be explored, and when navigation was done by sextant rather than GPS.<br /><br />As perhaps the only modern naval drama of the contemporary period, the film spares no opportunity to shed light on this age of tall wooden ships.  The brutality of naval warfare, and the crudeness of shipboard medical care is on full display and one cannot help but be both impressed and awed by the character and courage of the men who sailed in this period.<br /><br />The transfers are of excellent quality, and the bonus features - which include a pop-up map feature to indicate where the current action is taking place, are enjoyable but not distracting.  In fact I felt that this edition has the proper balance of special features and price as to not feel bloated with worthless add-ons to make for a very good value.<br /><br />Though Crowe's star has faded somewhat in recent years, this Blu Ray captures the actor at his peak even though his performance  is comparably subdued.  Crowe is alternately dark and severe, then light and raucous, and again boyishly mischievous - all the qualities one would expect to emanate naturally from a Royal Naval Captain, and some of his best moments on screen are when he says nothing at all and we see that drama playing out behind his eyes.  The scene where he makes eye contact with an indigenous woman while requisitioning is one fine example.<br /><br />I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could, five stars being reserved for truly timeless and classic films worthy of such superlative rankings.  However, movie goers who are searching for gripping story lines with brilliants acting and cinematography will not be disappointed and will see their money well spent investing in this edition.
B0098VXDDS|4.0|Well doe, great acting and special effects that are over the top but that LEDs to the atmosphere. The dialog is on point, well done.
B008K8U13K|4.0|In my opinion, this game is very cool. Even though everyone on xbox live arcade and PlayStation network hates it, I enjoyed it. Someone please give me Sonic the hedgehog 1 that came out in late June of 2013
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I cannot imagine the pressure Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Ozzy Osbourne felt when they started recording a new album after 35 years.  Led Zeppelin didn't have the guts to do it. And all this  after a fantastic tour and album with Dio \\"The Devil You Know\\" followed by his death and the cancer struggle of Tony Iommi.  And the decision of Bill Ward not to join the project. But they did it! They have created a classic Black Sabbath  album from the early 70-ies! The songs are so good that they measure up with their classics! \\"End of the Beginning\\" \\"God Is Dead?\\" \\"Age of Reason\\", \\"Live Forever \\", \\"Loner\\" are 100% Sabbath at their best! Zeitgeist is a beautiful Planet Caravan Pt2 . \\"Damaged Soul\\" reminds of their first album and goes back to their blues/jazz roots. Great song.  The guitar riffs are outstanding, Gezzer's bass is as thunderous as ever. Ozzy is singing as he was 20 again! The mood of the album is dark and the lyrics are about life and death and also about today's world drowning in  insanity and madness. I find the artwork perfectly fits to this.  The last song, \\"Dear Father\\" is about  child abuse by priests and finishes with their  1970 debut album's \\"Black Sabbath\\" Intro. Is this a farewell from the band? The bonus tracks are excellent but I agree that they don't fit with the rest of the album.  They are also a vintage Sabbath tracks, but they sound more modern. And the idea of the album is to recreate the magic of their first five albums. And, believe me, they do! For me this is the musical event of a decade for the genre.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|Reading the synopsis did not guide an accurate summary. There are a few govt channels and a couple shopping channels but not enough for me to take up space on my kindle. Luckily not expensive. I'm glad to spend a dollar to warn others what is really like.
B00D6M86RS|4.0|The developers know pinball. The physics are accurate and the tables are gorgeous. The accents of the tables could only be done with a digital product and I am glad I picked this up.<br /><br />The developers also did a product called \\"Pinball FX 2\\" for Steam and the tables behave exactly the same. Great work.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I've been a fan of ABR since 2005 when I saw them on tour with Demon Hunter and Zao. I wasn't a huge fan of their first album \\"Thrill Seeker,\\" but I knew they had great potential. When their next album, \\"Messengers\\" came out I was completely blown away. I hear a lot of people talking about \\"Constellations\\" being ABR's best album. I disagree. With Rescue and Restore ABR went back to more of the \\"in your face\\" metal from Messengers. To me, that is excited. To me, R&R and fresh and I feel the time and effort they put into the album. I love how they dedicated themselves to being different and unique on this album. Some fans will hate it and others, (like myself) embrace it and love it.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|the best action movie ever. I would recommend this move to everyone. I would buye it and play it to watch it again.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very helpful and accurate app!  Better than using weather.com that's for sure.  It seems clear and precise and I am glad to have found it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|The book is way better than the movie and I am so glad I read the book before I watched the movie.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This incredible series brings the history of old England alive in some very interesting ways. The writing is top rate, the actors are superb and the suspense keeps one wanting more. There is intrigue, deceit, passioned sex, unpredictable plots and pure relaxing entertainment. This series is a must!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Baldacci has done it again.  His mysteries keep me on the edge.  I really have difficulty putting his books down!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Awesome story about a country I knew very little about.  A definite must read!!!!  This was similar to the Kite Runner but then also quite different in the storyline.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love dogs but I am not a fan of car racing so I thought I would have to struggle to get thru this book. Wrong! This is a story of a special pooch, told on a sad day as he prepares for his death. Enzo is the narrator and he lives with Denny,an upcoming race car driver and he is happy. Then Denny meets a Eve, a human companion,and his world is changed. Enzo's life is further changed with the arrival of Zoe, a little girl, who he adores. Life goes on with its ups and downs and you get drawn into his story. AS you read you realize Enzo is getting older and is still loved by everyone so much they don't want to make that decision that will end his life. Yes the ending is bittersweet but still very enjoyable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an excellent &#34;soap opera&#34; with good story lines, fine actors and all the intrigue you want.  Definitely recommend this series.
1416979174|5.0|It been years since I wanted this book, I was excited when I saw it. It cam in time, even though I didn't use it yet. Eric Carle books are great and fun and the children learn something
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a good game to test the limits and the capabilities of your mind. Have a good time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|one of the best apps ever and I donmot regret downloading. it at all. j recommend it to everybody out there's looking for mystery and puzzles
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Wonderful story, characters, and great acting. Sorry when the feature is done. Hope the program will continue for many years to come.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|I was sooo looking fwd to this book. It was very hard to follow on a kindle.  Characters are introduced randomly and with detail and its difficult to reference where they fit into the story.  If I had read the physical book you could more easily go back and try to reference the family lineage.
B008HK3XKO|4.0|This is a nice case at a reasonable price.  It is helpful when using the stand when working and it gives enough protection to the Kindle for easy travel.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|My book club selected this book and when I saw the subject matter I was less than excited to take on the read.  It was a fantastic book.  The characters were developed and full.  The story takes a turn and sticks with it.  It was a great book discussion book!
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|This show is brilliant! The casting, storyline, music, costumes, setting, and filming is all-around fantastic. I can't wait to watch season 3!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome great to have easy access via amazon. Awaiting season 4  character development. Comparable to the anticipation on series 3 of SHERLOCK.  L
0062225677|5.0|I was gifted a great selection of the Discworld books, but it never felt right to begin anywhere other than here. It's brilliant, funny, and should be enjoyed by a wide audience.
B000063S6Z|5.0|What a great selection of songs!  Well  crafted! Good job and so entertaining and fun; yet not wordy and boring.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I started watching this show on t.v. on year 4, so this was a great opportunity to see the show from the beginning and fill in the episodes that I missed.  It was a quality show and I'm very glad that I purchased this set.
B0032CVAQQ|3.0|I did find this book useful, because it made me think about different ways in which my husband would like me to show affection and what kinds of attention both he and I prefer. It's a pretty quick, simple read, but gets a little repetitive at times.
1781162646|2.0|When I read reviews about \\"Joyland\\" that talk about how the characters burst from the page, or wax poetic about the \\"haunting\\" quality of the book, I have to wonder if we read the same book.  This book tries too hard to be too many things: rite de passage, murder mystery, horror thriller.  I didn't find that it succeeded in any of them.<br /><br />I don't read a lot of murder/crime fiction.  The last I read was Stieg Larsson, which is perhaps not a fair comparison. The Larsson novels are long, intricately connected, deftly constructed and brashly unsentimental. Take the reverse of each of those descriptors and you have \\"Joyland\\", a predictable, plodding period piece which brashly breaks the rules of crime fiction, namely in that it resolves conflicts using the supernatural.  Supernatural books are fine.  King can write whatever he likes.  But when anything can happen, nothing matters.  Main character is held at gunpoint on a ferris wheel by a deranged carny killer? Just have a ghost alert one of the other characters. Deus ex machina! Too easy.<br /><br />It doesn't work.  Nor does the rite of passage story.  Lovesick boy gets it on with older woman. First time he cums, he shoots his wad.  Oh please.  We've been there too many times before.  Even Milo the dog drips with sentimentality, tail wagging to beat the band.<br /><br />I kept waiting for some evidence that I was reading the work of an American fiction master.  I kept waiting for a plot twist that I didn't see coming on high-beam. An unconventional conversation that sounded like real people talking. I kept wanting to suspend disbelief. I couldn't, not for a minute.  I got to the end, but only through main force.<br /><br />Yes, this book has some enjoyable moments. But it left me wanting to read something like \\"The Stand\\" or one of King's better known masterpieces. This one is for the freak tent. Methinks the emperor is wearing no clothes.
B00CXL6XP0|5.0|Finally a killer Queensryche disc with insane vocals on it,back to their roots in some songs and more current on others.If you are a true fan you will love this well crafted gem.
B00594XOZU|4.0|Kik is a great split let's you talk to friends , that's great ! The thing is that people find you and don't k is you at all so you are in danger of telling them personal things , on the other side it's an Awesome app you should buy it
B000FCK65W|5.0|Always heard about this book and finally got to read it, awards given well deserved.  Had no trouble getting wrapped up with  characters.  Could not put it down and that's reason for 5 stars.  Grew up in NYC in the 50's and always heard my parents stories about growing up around 1910 in Manhattan.  Reading this book brought back so many fond memories.  Highly recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The only thing that could make this show better is if there were two of everybody, maybe even three. If you do not like this show then you need to evaluate your life. This show is better than eating bacon. This show is even better than not having to share the bacon you are eating. Grab your white tie and watch it. Fire up some tea as well, you are going to need it.
B005RUV0NY|4.0|I'm a huge and ardent fan of the show.  I didn't think I would be, at first, because on the surface, the plot seems to be &#34;a million and one ways to kill a zombie&#34;.  But... that's not it.  At all.<br /><br />The show is about how very ordinary people will change when given only three choices: live, die, or become a mindless killer.  There is absolutely no gray area in between those three states of being.  It's about how they deal with their own changes and the changes of their friends, family, loved ones, enemies, and other previously ordinary strangers.<br /><br />And, that being the case, I found I didn't need to pay for the HD version.  I get all that and more from SD resolution.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I'm usually not a musical person but smash is great. I fell in love from the first episode and can't wait for the next all the time
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Good character development. Interesting plot. Main character was very interesting and well played. Pace of movie held my interest all the way through.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Love mahjong and this plays very well on my fire. Like the many different shapes to play different games. I would recommend this one if you own a kindle fire.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I was looking for a game I would actually play and I found it. I really enjoy this game and slaughtering the different enemies. If you don't want to spend money on gear and what not you will be doing a lot of grinding to lvl up an  get coins. I was playing and doing well, I was able to kill demons without to much trouble and I went into.the next area and got slaughtered so I had to go.back and grind to lvl up and get coins to upgrade my gear and it took awhile but I enjoy doing it.so.If you don't like grinding you have to spend money to buy better weapons and armor so it's one or the other so that might turn some people away.  Come on though for a game on the kindle it's pretty dang good
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I am an avid magic the gathering player. I became addicted to the card game about 20yrs ago but over the last few years it's been hard to find people to play with and I didn't want to play it on a console. My husband found the app for magic 2014 like yesterday on my kindle fire. I decided to give it a shot, thinking that playing it on a touchscreen may feel kind of like playing for real. Well, I was right. It does. I have been playing almost non stop for the last 24 hours. (I may even call into work sick...cough, cough) Lol. The game has the right amount of challenge but doesn't make you want to break things while playing. Absolutely the BEST 9.99$ I ever spent (unlocking the full game, trust me it's worth it). If you play magic and you really like magic, this is definitely the game to buy. Thanks to all the game designers cause you made my day!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|In this game you get your own virtual horse. You can take care of it, feed it, and enter it in competitions. I am not a horse lover but I found this game very amusing and used it as a time waster.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I am happy with this game and its options.  I have never seen a game that offers a guaranteed winning deal.  That will help me teach my son and help him be proud of his &quot;accomplishments&quot; long enough to help him learn to play without a guaranteed win.  The only negative is the add that you have to get past before every game.  You either press on the correct area for a screen with an ignore button to show up or you have to find a way to close the window.  If it were not for that I would have given it 5 stars.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|It's been 3 days now and it still hasn't downloaded. It was at 100 and I had to download it again and its been 30 min now and still isn't even at 1 percent. It's a ripoff and waste of time to handle with. It looks good for my kindle fire HD and that's why I didn't give it 1 star.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You must have this game! This is an all round great and wonderfully fascinating game, you can not survive long without !!!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Runs very smooth.  Although you can't fully customize the decks exactly the way you want to the cards they give you in each deck compliment each other nicely. As always with magic you never play the same game twice.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When i try to download it it says I dont have enough space on my sd card and I only have one app on it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season was really good. Keeped you wanting more  and more. Cant wait for season 4 to come out already. This should be a year long episode.
0061537969|5.0|This is one of the best stories.  I love how LOA, manifestation and enlightenment are threaded within the story from a Dog with a higher consciousness.  It made me laugh and cry.  I would definitely see the movie if they made one.
B00B2FLDRQ|3.0|It is entertaining and sometimes moving but a little overrated. There are some very good parts and others quite weak.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Great movie to watch with the Grandchildren!!!<br /><br />The story is good to be who you are no matter what, and your true self will be with you.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I had never before heard of Lee Child. A very positive surprise. Full of suspense surprise and humor. The dialogues are great.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This one is also fun, I'm just not good at it!  I keep trying though!!!  The grandkids also beat me at this one!!!  LOL!!!
B001HBSVMA|5.0|Great movie that stands up on rewatching. All these actresses who want to be &#34;smart&#34; and be a top student at Harvard is an excessive not credible thing. But, they needed Bullock and that surely got her into the deal (and Tom Cruise amped it up as a Harvard guy in The Firm so that was similar).<br /><br />If she had just gone to Harvard that would have toned it down a bit. However, she certainly allowed herself to look vulnerable in so many ways that all of that is offset by that.<br /><br />Small issues and I had to say something critical while giving it a perfect 5.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I LOVE Facebook!  I am a widow and I have met so many old and new friends on here.....they help make my life less lonely!  I enjoy a couple of the games and it's nice to share pictures of the grandkids!  I love it!!!
B005DN7W4G|5.0|We have watched this movie many times; now bought it in Blu-ray.  I am a disaster movie junkie (and my husband only likes some of them-this being one)and this one is well done.  Interestingly that year the two asteroid movies came out (the other being Armageddon) and they were both very good in their own ways.
0439023491|4.0|I loved the first one more....this one was ok!  I'm really looking forward to MOCKINGJAY!  What I really loved was the fact that my 13 year old granddaughter read it too and we compared notes!!!
B004GYY714|5.0|Well-organized, fairly easy to use. Tells you what to expect with paid version---and I doubt I will ever need it. Was recommended to me by a friend and I highly recommend it<br />, as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is filled with fun!! if you are bored with one game move on to another! Some are very hard where as others are pretty easy!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I did not see the ending coming the way it did. A several layers of plot with many interesting twists.
B00139XTG4|2.0|The book looks like a paper at the mathematicians convention. And the author seems caring more that nobody in the community<br />does not understand him than on trying to communicate his ideas. Book seems wrote in a harsh.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I love Carole King's music.  This is a treasure!  Anyone who is from this era will enjoy this as well as those of us who remember it.
B008IGAJJK|5.0|Fantastic film. Up there with The Graduate, The Producers and other great comedies. Some of the greatest lines of all time.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book is very intriguing. This book made me get tears in my eyes in several different parts of the story. I loved learning the story of Hannah Baker. I felt like I was in the story, and that I experienced everything with Hannah. This book is just amazing.
B005HSG3U6|5.0|Durable and thin. Dropped many times by my daughter and still intact. Much thinner than the book type cases that I have previously had. The stand is just okay. Nothing great. It does work but I don't use it much so it doesn't bother me. Also is snaps on easily with the Moshi iVisor AG Screen Protection for Kindle Fire (Anti-Glare) I bought along with the case. Highly recommended.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|Megan has come to the Oregon coastal town of Pride for the funeral of her brother. The cast around her right arm and the bruises on her back are the remainder of a most recent  abusive act of an ex-husband, a relationship that has filled her with shame and self-regret. It is in Pride where she finds healing and a new life with her brother's closest friends, the Jordans, including elder brother, Todd, who is immediately smitten with Megan. But will Megan find this new relationship to be one she could trust? As a means of disclaimer, I will admit I am not a fan of the overwrought angst romance of this sort, but the characters are well-written and very relatable and the book proved to be a very quick read, which should be very satisfactory for those who enjoy this brand of romance.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|The book kept me interested, I couldn't put it down. I really felt for the people involved.  It gave me a close insight of being in his state of mind and making the decisions in his life and a  understanding in all the characters lives.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|The side story lines I don't think are explained enough, was hoping to be more jaw dropping. Pretty racey for sure though!
B004G6TD66|5.0|great quality audio,added tracks on the cd makes this the one to buy.the sound is better than earlier cds clear sound
B009YP9L7U|1.0|This book is so boring ! Not to mention the hero was really unlikable  and hard to follow, his emotions were all over the place ... Hated it
B005LAIIN0|4.0|You know what? You take movies like Rise Of the Planet of the Apes, the 2011 adaptation of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo or even 21 Jump Street;(movies that on the surface look like failed attempts to be more than what they are), but once you watch them you feel like a total idiot because those movies are better than you would have even expected? World War Z IS one of those movies. And yes IT IS REALLY GOOD.<br /><br />World War Z stars Brad Pitt as Gerry and almost instantly we are introduced to he and his family; his wife Karin portrayed by Mireille Enos. The acting in this film was good; almost too good for a movie like this. The movie itself is nearly two hours but the pace of the film is fast. The story line carries the film to different parts of the world while it brings suspense, action, and obviously, a lot of zombies.<br /><br />I have seen many movies with good use CGI and bad use of CGI. In World War Z the CGI is not the best, but it is such a good movie that it is really nothing to complain about.<br /><br />I will say I like this movie a lot for what it is. It does not feel like a Michael Bay Transformers film that despite (great action sequences and visuals), has dumb cheesy moments or is a movie that is too long, and it definitely is not like any other recent movie with zombies, no World War Z is truly artful, and surprisingly intriguing. The action is great, the story is excellent, and great job from the multi-talented supporting cast. As suggested with the climatic sequence of the film, and the confirmation by the good people at Paramount Pictures, there will be a sequel (hopefully Sequels). I myself, along with many others I know in the world will be waiting and watching. World War Z gets<br /><br />4 Stars
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|Loved the graphics in the movie the fight scenes and though all may not agree the one liners and little quirks that brought the movie in a different direction at times it livened up the movie and made it more realistic good movie recommend it to others
B008JFUPOY|5.0|Pixar has done it yet again. Admittedly, I was rather nervous and skeptical after hearing that this movie would be a prequel rather than a sequel. But the people at Pixar have quite the talent and deliver a great movie once again.<br /><br />Monsters University starts out with the loveable Mike Wazowski as a boy. He is the kid in the class no one wants to really be around or be friends with; but as Mike enters college you realize that although he has a very likeable determination, he is missing one key quality as a monster. It is in college where Mike meets his eventual nemesis Randy Boggs, and his soon to be friend James Sulley Sullivan. As the story progresses, it is becomes obvious that Mike has the knowledge, and the determination, and Sulley has the quality that Mike needs. The acting is awesome yet again, the story is well thought up and there is a lot of scare for everyone.<br /><br />My final thoughts and closing remarks for this review will be: Monsters University does succeed as a prequel; as great as Pixar is, my only hope is that they consider making a sequel to Monsters Inc. and The Incredibles. But nonetheless, Monsters University is a dazzling<br /><br />5 Stars
B00992CF6W|1.0|i already paid for this game and i love minecraft but it wont download on my kindle fire. im very disappointed now :(
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Daniel Day-Lewis is never anything but amazing. Sally Fields never did an average job of acting, she's an incredible talent like Day-Lewis. Tommy Lee Jones is another tremendous talent and doesn't disappoint. Spielberg is an astounding director/producer. And like a lot of people, I admire President Lincoln despite knowing his flaws. What he did in his day was an act of absolute courage. The movie itself was all right. Maybe I expected too much.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Interesting and a part of American history not usually talked about (except in my book club).  I enjoyed the flashbacks more than the modern story.
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|I was bored so I bought the movie. I can't stand Quentin Tarantino movies like Kill Bill - I watched that for less than 15 minutes and turned it off. But I'm a history nut and was curious because of all the controversy. I decided I could close my eyes at the violence. But I ended up liking the movie and was happy that there was a cartoonish aspect to the violence so it didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. I admit I did close my eyes a lot of the time. Still, I suppose I liked how it ended and that made the difference. I'm a fan of repressed people rising up strong and unafraid. Although I hate killing, like I said, it seemed so over the top it wasn't real, just a movie. This really, really surprised me.
B00881VLCE|2.0|This game will not load the puzzles. The screen just goes black.. I love to do puzzles on line, but this one is a waste
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|Great cast, sounded like it would be epic but it was as confusing and uninteresting as the critics said. And I don't often believe critics.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I heard everyone talking about this game so I got it. Now that I have it, I can't seem yo stop playing it! I  is so fun and ADDICTING with all the high speed chases, daily challenges, and the chance to earn special boards and characters!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|O M G!!!  This was well written and explores every parent's darkest nightmare.  Very difficult to read at times, yet very difficult to stop reading.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I love this show! Got right into it from the beginning and lived it all the way through to the end!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I cannot describe how this Documentary touched me. I've watched it over and over. I even went to see him in person after watching this.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|Loreena McKennitt's music is truly world music. This album takes traditional English and Celtic songs and breathes new life into them. I've been listening to her since 1993, bought every other album available, and she still never fails to transport me to another world, another time and, on occasion, another dimension. If you enjoy world music or just good music, Loreena McKennitt's work is a must have!
B009A9SULS|1.0|The kobo mini is small, light and easy to carry. This is it's only advantage over other e-readers. As other reviews will note, it is glitchy, slow, and freezes often. It also does not format pdf's well at all which makes them near impossible to read.<br /><br />All of that was almost tolerable however until I got a weird distortion on the top right hand corner of my device. I emailed support who promptly told me that it was physical damage and that the warranty didn't cover it.<br /><br />I couldn't understand how it could be physical damage since I hadn't dropped it and carried it in a sleeve within a padded backpack when I went out. After a week of having to email support over and over again for an explanation and looking online, it seems like the problem is some broken inner screen.<br /><br />As I said before, I'm very careful with my gadgets and this is the first piece of tech I've ever owned that hasn't even lasted a year.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Love it got to find old friend an d make New ones read storys and play games. See what is going on in this crazy world
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a great game to play and I really enjoy playing it. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The full version has a lot of game play. Many decks that you can play and play against. Also excellent for learning how to play magic. Tutorial is good for newbies.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I love this book because of the Enzo Denny Eve and Zoe were all great in the end it  made me cry
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun little app and great distraction to make you and test your skill. Sometimes it seemed it would not detect where I tapped but that could just be operator error!  I would recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am in love with the characters. Puts 50 Shades of Gray to shame. So realistic, honest and raw. I don't want the story to end. A must read series for all.
B00DGXGUSY|5.0|Quite a great album full of heavy songs with great lyrics and riffs. Probably one of my favorite albums and a great one about the god Loki and his children as well as his role come Ragnarok.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I find this game very addicting. I just can&quot;t seem to put it down. I love that it challenges my thought processes.
B007MU85D0|5.0|There are no words to describe how I feel when I hear this music. I love the entire album, all the songs are perfect, they are so different and new. I am a fan.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is fun I enjoy taking care of a horses this game is the best game ever I have never played a game like this one this game is one of a kind easy controls my little sister loves this game.
B005BGBPBG|4.0|I enjoy comparing the book and the movie, and I don't always think that the book is better because both, the book and the movie are different kinds of medias. So, I like the movie, it was fun, funny, you see the characters that you love in the book and the ones you hate. I just hope they made the second part.
B008ETOSYI|5.0|Two words: Zac Efron!!!!! Alone he could make any movie great. In \\"The Lucky One\\" with Taylor Schilling he is fantastic. Great chick flick. Loved it.
B001HBWY8M|3.0|The movie is funny and cute, it's not the best movie ever made, but it was okay. The music is good.
