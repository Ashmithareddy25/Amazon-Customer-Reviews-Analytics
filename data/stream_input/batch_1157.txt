B002IVLH60|5.0|This is such a great album. The best PJ album since perhaps No Code . This is a lot better than Yield, Binaural etc. The highlights include Unthought Known which I simply cannot get enough of, Force of Nature and many others. Wow is this ever awesome. This is a throwback to early Pearl Jam and also doesn't have any of the dumb experimental stuff like on Vitalogy. This is a CLASSIC
B001QWBM62|5.0|The H4N is a great product.  It can be used in so many ways.  For the price you couldn't ask for a more powerful, more versatile unit. It's small, portable and light weight.  It's easy to use.  The menu is easy to navigate through. It has built in effects processing, variable microphone polar patterns, USB interfacing for data transfers and storage and 3 record modes. It can be used as a stereo recorder, a four channel recorder or a multi-track recorder/mixer.  I use it as field recorder to mike the choir loft at my church, to record my guitar lessons (it comes in handy as a phrase trainer/sampler), record band rehearsals and use it to multi-track new song ideas.  If you want a recording studio you can fit in your back pack or the the glove box or your car then this is it.  Perfect!
B002AT4K9G|4.0|Great movie! Takes place before Tokyo Drift. Love the title sequence with the fuel truck and the cars stealing the trailers!

0307477479|5.0|I really liked this book.  The subject/timeframe (music biz over the last 30 years) is interesting, and the book is very well-written.  Moreover, there are literary conventions that really set this book apart from other books.  For one, the story isn't told in a straightforward fashion.  Each chapter tells the story of a group of characters (almost like a short story), and the story is told from the viewpoint of one of these characters.  In each subsequent chapter, the reader is introduced to new characters and a new story.  The chapters (and stories) aren't in any sort of chronological either so there is a lot of time shifts in the novel.  However, as you begin to get into the novel, you realize that all the characters are related in some way -- either as children or relations of existing characters or via the same set of experiences.    The second to last chapter is told by a young girl via her \\"slideshow\\" (her own version of her personal diary).  It's an amazing way to tell a story.  Instead of a 20-page chapter telling her story, we learn the story of her parents / family via 20 slides, each containing only a limited number of words.  But the word selection and the way she presents each word on the page (connections and context) tells the story.        And the last chapter is set a little bit in the future and gives a very disturbing and thought-provoking view of our digital world.  This book will really make you think.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|This is the movie that adapts the first half of the dullest and dreariest of the series of books by J.K. Rowling. (Not the longest book, nor the book with the most events, but I'm sure Warner Brothers is now kicking themselves and wishing they'd started splitting these back at Azkaban to make twice as much money.)<br /><br />I haven't changed my opinion of the book -- which is, by far, the worst of the series, with a sag in the middle like a couch that Hagrid just sat on -- and the movie is as deeply faithful to the book in the way that this series of movies always has been...and that means, of course, that it's full of dull, dreary camping sequences, in which Harry, Ron, and Hermoine mope at each other for what feels like the full eight months the book covers.<br /><br />(Somewhere in the middle of that, my younger son quietly stated that he wasn't having any fun and went up to his room to play. When your movie isn't more entertaining than playing alone with dominoes, you've got a serious problem.)<br /><br />The plot makes as much sense here as it did in the book: which is to say, it's still the quintessentially English story about a boy who definitely isn't too smart for his station, but is indomitable enough to muddle through because his heart is true. Rowling has no interest in a resistance movement against her magical dictator, nor does she care about what's happening to the UK under Voldemort (much less the rest of the world, which nearly doesn't exist in the Harry Potter world), or even in depicting Harry Potter as any kind of leader or competent hero.<br /><br />No, instead Deathly Hallows 1 is the story of three friends (who hate each other) hiding out in the woods instead of trying to find the seven magical [Plot Coupons] Horcruxes, which they need (along with three pounds fifty in coins) to send off to Rowling for an ending. And this movie doesn't even get them to the point where they actually start to accomplish their quest, so it's entirely ominous beginning and dreary middle. This is the movie you have to get through to get Deathly Hallows 2, and you'd have to be a stone Potter fan -- the kind unwilling to admit anything connected to Rowling is less than fabulous -- to strongly enjoy it as a movie in its own right.s the movie you have to get through to get Deathly Hallows 2, and you'd have to be a stone Potter fan -- the kind unwilling to admit anything connected to Rowling is less than fabulous -- to strongly enjoy it as a movie in its own right.
B000004286|1.0|I love the soundtrack to Braveheart - the stirring sound of the the Great Highland Bagpipes, the discerning use of traditional Scottish themes in the music, the authenticity of the instrumentation ... wait, that isn't the soundtrack to Braveheart! That's Irish pipes we're hearing - Uilleann pipes, they're called - and they are strongly characteristic of Irish traditional music, not Scottish.<br /><br />There's nothing in the music that evokes the highlands of Scotland -did James Horner ever travel to Scotland to feel what the highlands are like? Did he listen to one note of Scottish music to feel the history and spirit of the sound? I can't imagine that he did.<br /><br />What we get with this movie are the standard sweeping strings, the horns for the fight scenes, and the Irish sound of Uilleann pipes and the occasional flute to make sure we're thinking Irish not Scottish.<br /><br />This would have worked better for an Irish movie, not one set in Scotland.
B003UESJF6|3.0|There's nothing at all wrong with MEGAMIND, but there's not as much right with it as there could have been. For a while, it flirts with being a demented remake of the first Christopher Reeve Superman movie -- or maybe just appropriates a few ideas from that film in the way all animated movies now shamelessly pander to the assumed tastes of the parents of the rugrats watching it [1] -- but it always settles back into the groove of Kid-Approved Plot #4: Misunderstood Loner Makes Good.<br /><br />Megamind (voice of Will Ferrell, sounding like he's actually playing a character rather than doing the Will Ferrell thing, and that's good) has the funny version of Superman's origin: rocketed to Earth from a doomed planet, but landed in a prison. His nemesis, Metroman (voice of Brad Pitt, and in the movie much less than you'd expect from the ads), has the good-guy version of that origin, and so they fight, starting when they both go to the same little red schoolhouse as tots. The Lois Lane figure is Roxanne Ritchie (voice of Tina Fey, not really sounding like herself, either), who's feisty enough that you almost don't notice that her entire role in the movie is to be the girl that strong men will fight over.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie, though, takes place after the Megamind-Metroman conflict has been permanently resolved, leaving Megamind at loose ends. And, since this is a movie for kids, his devotion to evil is purely based in liking to wear capes with dark colors and an appreciation for the stoner anthems of my childhood. To be blunt, he's not actually evil in any sense, and his nefarious schemes were all entirely devoted to killing Metroman -- not to stealing anything, or conquering the world, or any more traditionally evil doings.<br /><br />And we all know that the ending has to have Megamind turning into a good guy and saving everyone, right? Even supposedly edgy and goofy animated movies these days have to be massively renormative in the end, and MEGAMIND is no exception; everything turns out as nice as nice can be. It is pretty funny along the way, though -- even Megamind's random mispronunciations, which I was expecting to become horrible very quickly, stay few and funny, and even become an important plot point -- which is about what should be expected from a movie like this.<br /><br />[1] This movie has one particularly egregious example: all of the music in it is at least twenty years old, the songs we parents remember from our own youths.rns out as nice as nice can be.

B0034G4OY0|1.0|SPOILER ALERT(for your protection)  It was a waisted 2 hours of my life. First off, it intraduced 2 characters that just disapeared within the first 20 minutes. Also the tsunami scene in the camercial was only about 5 minutes long and was the only action scene in the movie.  Over all, I wouldn't recomend watching it, unless you were trying to commence a slow, and painful death.
B002T9H2MO|4.0|The critically acclaimed `Moon' made on a budget of only US$5 million is science fiction at its best. The film is dramatic and novelistic in style, character- and idea-driven rather than action-based. In this respect it resembles `Blade Runner', Tarkovsky's original `Solaris' and Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' - all which explored how we might need to re-define what it means to be `human' with developing technology and deeper exploration of environments away from the Earth. The plot of `Moon' reveals unexpected twists which lead the audience to consider disturbing possibilities in our future if biotechnology continues along its recent track unrestrained by a moral or ethical framework, and the philosophical implications such developments might bring. Don't think however this means it's not fun to watch: it's a rollicking good movie with great storyline development and editing; we care about the main protagonist and how he deals with his situation and (without giving away the plot) your attention will be held from first frame to last.<br /><br />The acting is basically a one-man show. The choice of Sam Rockwell to play Sam Bell, the lone astronaut serving out his three-year contract supervising mineral-harvesters on the far side of the Moon, is excellent. Rockwell has 99% of the screen time and the audience experiences everything through him, as he gradually discovers things are not as they seem in his isolated world. A lesser actor might not have carried off this difficult role so well. Sam's only company is the station's friendly and helpful robot-computer `Gerty' voiced to perfection by Kevin Spacey and with emoticons to express his 'mood'. Gerty owes something to Arthur C. Clarke's omniscient HAL 9000 in `2001.' However unlike HAL, Gerty does not turn into a formidable enemy to be outwitted by the human protagonist, but fulfils his programming to be helpful and supportive of Sam no matter what happens.<br /><br />Despite the limited resources committed to the film, the sets don't look low budget. Both the extensive Moon-base interior and the outside-on-the-surface scenes look pretty good, reportedly achieved by the deployment of scale models and limited but subtle use of CGI.<br /><br />First-time director Duncan Jones (son of rock superstar David Bowie) reveals a real young talent in `Moon', and the film will likely leave you thinking for several days afterwards. A second viewing is equally rewarding: without the storyline surprises of the first viewing, the artistry of the editing and the clever plot construction shine through even more. This is a thinking person's sci-fi movie which, devoid of spectacular special effects, space battles and explosions, returns to the core values of the genre. How gratifying to see the film not only recouped its modest investment and made a good profit, but is becoming a minor classic.<br /><br />`Moon' is recommended to all genuine sci-fi fans - and to any non-sci-fi fan who can appreciate clever scripting and good drama.ts don't look low budget.

B004OR1X6A|5.0|Rory Gallagher is Great. Myself and all his fans know this. Why the rest of the whole world doesn't Idolize<br />his greatness is a mystery to me. This CD 'Notes From San Francisco' contain 2 CD's. The first CD is the<br />so-called Holy Grail to Rory fans, the long lost album Rory decided to throw in the trash and start over.<br />He felt the album was over-produced or too must of everything that wasn't the essence of a Rory Gallagher<br />power trio Blues-Rock album. The 2nd CD is the reason I bought this. The best 64 minutes from 4 shows Rory<br />and his band gave in San Francisco in December 1979. All my favorite Rory albums are his live ones. My first<br />was 'Irish Tour '74' , my favorite was 'Stagestruck' from 1980. Go back in time for 'Live In Europe' maybe<br />'71 or '72. This is just the albums, or CDs, if we talk DVD's, the entire Rockpalast Collection, the entire<br />Montreaux collection, or back at home for 'Live in Cork' , all are must own Rory music collections.<br /> So, back to 'Notes From San Francisco' , disc 2 is the Holy Grail to me, newly released live Rory at<br />his Blues-Rock power Trio Best. The 1st CD is a treat, a delight to hear Rory and the band try new things<br />with the music, some of it is never before released, some as bonus tracks or other takes or versions or 'remixes'<br />All of it is better than the dreck they play on the radio or t.v.. Buy this 2 CD package, you'll thank me later.

B0051QIGP4|3.0|I'm not a Lady Gaga fan, but keep hearing so much about her that I decided to take a chance on this album when it came out, since I had heard a couple of the remixes and thought they were ok. Unfortunately, the album doesn't have the versions of the songs I've heard and what is on the album I just don't get.    The big surprise for me was a couple of songs later in the album, which sounded pretty polished and (don't kill me for this) almost like something you're hear on pop/country radio. Sort of slick production and pretty well written. More like radio hits than something you'd hear at a club. Unfortunately, not something I'm likely to listen to again. If I want that kind of stuff, I'll listen to somebody who specializes in it.    This album isn't 100% terrible, but as much as I've heard about her, I expected more.
1593272839|5.0|I'm not sure what kind of trick the author is pulling here, but this guide managed to walk me through all important Haskell concepts without ever making any of the material sound complicated. I had, through sheer force of will, managed to understand monads a few years back, so I didn't start from zero -- but somehow none of the mind-bending I remembered from last time was necessary this time around. Even terms like Applicative Functor and Monoid, which I assumed to be things only category theory wizards could possibly be interested in, are exposed by Lipovaca to be relatively simple, banal concepts with everyday uses.    The book doesn't go into any of the really hairy stuff, such as monad transformers, the subtleties of laziness, or unsafe IO, which are probably required for serious Haskell programming. But I guess it's excused, since it does call itself a beginner's guide. It *does* do a very fine job of showing how purity, type classes, and category theory concepts provide mind-blowingly elegant solutions to real, practical programming tasks. As such, I've started recommending it to anyone who asks for a good introduction to functional programming.
0312600844|2.0|The only reason that I ploughed through this much-hyped book to the end was that I had undertaken to read it for a book club. But at the time, I felt I was being hit by a heavy sandbag suspended over my head, knocking me into a kind of stupor whenever I picked the book up, and shadowing most else in my life even when I was not reading. Yes, I see the reasons for the hype: Franzen writes well; he captures the spirit of a very unspiritual age; he is clever in the ways he introduces the various aspects of Freedom; but the whole thing is about a group of utterly small people whose lives and horizons are equally small.<br /><br />The first third of the book at least admits to its smallness. It is a little domestic drama about a former college basketball star, the midwestern lawyer she marries, and the minor rock artist who quickens her pulse. People warned me that this might be dull, but I found a kind of integrity in its reduced scope. Most of it is told by the wife in frank confessional style. But as she refers to herself in the third person, she is not so different from Franzen's own voice, though avoiding the worst of his snide cleverness. Right from the beginning, there is something superior and judgmental in an attitude that can skewer a lifestyle as easily as pinning a butterfly to a board. And when the book opens out at about page 190, expanding its focus to the next generation, moving from Minnesota to Washington, and taking on more controversial aspects of the recent Bush administration, Franzen's tone, whether writing on his own or speaking through his characters, becomes politicizing rather than political. While I agree with many of his causes, I don't want to be bulldozed into a political rally in the guise of reading a novel. Unfortunately, the personal lives of the characters, which might have given the book some balance, degenerate into amorality, disaffection, depression, greed, and some very gross sex.<br /><br />\\"It will get better at the end,\\" people told me. Well yes, it does. But 50 pages attempting to reset the moral compass at the end of a 560-page book are too little too late. As it happens, I am currently preparing a production of THE TEMPEST, and am in awe at Shakespeare's ability to create a magical resolution that is nonetheless true to character, and extols the wonder of the human spirit. Even in modern literature, there are writers who confirm our humanity, transforming us through our reading. Franzen, however, has done the opposite, writing a book that makes me reluctant to read. I find myself looking dubiously at the other recent novels about modern life waiting on my pile, wondering if they too will be about people whose lack of spiritual resonance is equally mind-numbing. I don't mean religion, I don't mean simple morality, so much as a sense of the wonder, the purpose, the LARGENESS of life. But this is a book so utterly without magic that its very existence is an affront to humanity.es, it does.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|So it's the middle of the night and I carelessly placed this bag on top of a wheeled cart instead of setting the bag on dirt and getting it dirty.  As I'm setting up my tripod, I see the bag slip, my heart stops beating while I'm watching the bag do a slow motion fall to the ground.  I was saying Nooooooooooooooo in my head watching the bag fall.  The bag fell and hit on its side.  After a few choice words of loud cussing, I checked my gear and all my gear survived!<br /><br />IMHO, the #1 feature of this bag is it's ability to protect the stuff inside.  I had a stock lens attached to the camera, 2 other lens in separate compartment, a camera battery charger/power supply, a [[ASIN:B002UOCWUK Manfrotto 498RC2 Ball Head with Quick Release Replaces Manfrotto 488RC2]], and they all survived without damage.<br /><br />I also attached to the side tripod straps the [[ASIN:B001B2I9L8 Slik 615317 700DX Pro Tripod Legs Black]].  The straps held the heavy tripod perfectly balanced with my heavy gear on the opposite side inside the backpack.  I pick up the backpack by the handle, by the shoulder strap, by the front bungee cords and nothing has broken yet.<br /><br />I also exposed the bag to a sand storm for hours and no sand got through the zippers or any other openings.
B004LAIU4I|1.0|For the record, I have just about everything Paul Simon ever did and almost all of it is so pure in its originality, so melodic, so memorable, so timeless.  Brilliant artists feel the need to re-invent themselves. Bob Dylan was fearless in this - how any times? - and succeeded. John Lennon, Leo Kottke .... and so many others, also, because true artists need to evolve. There's always a grain of their former persona that they carry forward. Dylan took folk into rock. Lennon took being different into crusading and sometimes rebelling against the powers that be. Kottke found a young guy who opened new doors to his guitar genius. With this album, Paul Simon is negotiating his way forward with off-beat lyrics that usually work and music that usually does not. What, actually, do you take away from this CD? What do you remember? For, me, I'm sorry, nothing. It gets lost in quirkiness. It's a search without a eureka moment. There's no magic. It seems like he's been scared into following change, reacting to it. He's good enough to be change. Good enough to not deny us so much of his musical gift because it may seem passe to a new generation. It will not. He's done it before and he can do it again. He should ignore any praise for this effort. And comparing it to all but his most recent stuff is just silly. Its currently number 11 on Amazon. But, don't mistake popularity for artistic success. Popularity is commercial success. He just needs to relax enough for true inspiration to once again give us his miracle.
B000TGCR38|2.0|No doubt the main actress Carice is incredible in this film. But I question the accuracy of portraying a Character that has not sexual morals,I found the movie with unnecessary pornographic too graphic scenes. This movie has  a good plot and can be very educational, but the movie is ruined by the pornographic scenes, too bad the actors accepts roles like that. If you are christian do not buy this movie unless is reedited for general  audiences, we throw away in the trash the movie dvd. After this experience, we are less naive and more cautious about seeing /buying movies dvd.

0307887960|5.0|I've lost 7 pounds in 5 weeks.  For me that is a miracle. This is a stringent diet, but it works.  The first phase begins by eating ONLY lean protein for the first 2-7 days, depending on how much you want to lose. In the second phase you add vegetables.  You alternate days with protein only, veggies & protein, until you have achieved your weight goal.  In the 3rd phase add one piece of fruit a day, 1.5 oz of cheese daily, 2 slices of whole grain bread, 2 starches per week, 1 glass of wine per week, and one celebration meal per week.  Stay on the third phase 5 days x the # of pounds lost.  Final phase - eat within reason but maintain an all protein diet once a week.  You also eat 2-3T. of oat bran daily and walk 20-30 minutes daily.  It's not that hard once you get into it and see results.
B000008LNS|2.0|Hard rock song after hard rock song. There is no tune amongst them. Steve Lukather is not the same person who sung those beautiful ballads. The first three tracks have absolutely no melody whatsoever and just boom boom boom on the drums. This is without a doubt the hardest rock album the band did. First three tracks all 0/10  The first good moment is the tune in 'how many times', but this is significantly marred by the boring electric guitar riffage and that is the only noteable bit about the song, it then meanders and sounds exactly like the first three. 2/10  2 hearts is a boring, tacky, souless ballad in the style of guns n roses or Bryan Adams. Boring and totally insipid. 0/10  Wings of time is another mid tempo ballad. Just not much going on. There is a semblance of a melody somewhere, and the synthesiser/keys are ok (I like the three chord descending progression, very memorable), but I would have preferred them to be more prominent in the mix and a little more busy. All I hear is the bashing of the drums and the bass too high in the mix. Still, this is the only track so far that has any merit whatsoever and sounds like toto. 6/10  She knows the devil is back to the bash bash bash drums and the tuneless hard rock tripe from the first few tracks. Absolute nadir of the album. (Actually that's the whole album to be honest). Just no melody and just shouting and unmelodic. 0/10  The other side - finally. A proper track that sounds like Toto at their best. A great melody and drums that do not drown the mix. A memorable chorus, (slightly generic and the lyrics suck), this sounds like more of a Farenheit or Seventh One outtake, and that is a good thing. Better, but not amazing. (7/10)  Only you - interesting how all the ballads are squashed in one section of the album. Acoustic guitars! Wow! Forgot they existed on this album! A very nice track, but slightly repetitive in the chorus. Apart from that, very nice and the melodic break after the second chorus is sublime. This is the only track from the album I would put on a best of by Toto. (8.5/10)  Kingdom of desire - I like the track title, the only inventive one here. Slow paced rock song, with an interesting guitar riff, the tune is utterly unmemorable, but I find it to be inoffensive and listenable for some bizarre reason. I think it may be that the music sounds just slightly menacing - there are some minor rising chords. Not sure. Let's look at the lyrics. Very intreaguing lyrics. Suicidal? (6/10)  Jake to the bone sounds like the opening to 'Let it go' from toto's far superior album falling in between. This is just a meandering, boring stocatto track that goes nowhere and should have been a B-side at best. (1/10)    So, what do you have. An acceptable EP in my opinion.   Tracklisting: Wings of time, The other side, Only you, Kingdom of desire.  Ditch the rest of this tripe.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|I already had this movie on dvd, but wanted it on blu-ray!  This is a great movie with many little movies in it.  You will start one characters story, move to another story, get into it, and then when they move back to the previous story  you will find yourself saying, \\"WOw I completly forgot about them\\".  I hope I'm explaining it correctly.  Since I had the Blu-ray I took the dvd to work to give it away, and almost every other co-worker wanted it because they saw it and wanted it!  To sum this movie up, this is a good christmas movie or Valentines day movie!

As you lower the camera facing down (say while taking a macro shot) the lens creeps out of focus. It is not a real problem, but worth noting.<br />The Macro distance is much closer than advertised. I can get a good crisp focus at about 10 inches and faster auto focus at 12 inches. This was a pleasant surprise!

1439108277|5.0|What a marvelous book. Dr. Lewin presents physics in an enlightening and entertaining way that is a joy to read. No heavy math, just physics principles.     But (side note and not to discourage you from reading this marvelous book), if you want to truly see physics in all its glory go to the MIT website and search for \\"8.01 Physics I: Classical Mechanics\\" a video on-line course that Dr. Lewin taught in 1999. In the video course Dr. Lewin shows how physics is supposed to be taught. Do you remember high school physics or maybe an entry level college physics course and all the dry mathematical formulas that were presented with no rhyme or reason. Dr. Lewin develops the formulas and actually shows that they do what they purport to do. Warning: The course is calculus based and heavy on the math, but still a joy to watch.
030746363X|5.0|The name of the book it what caught my attention. My friend has talked about your 4 Hour Work Week book since it was printed. This book has me all jacked up to get my family in shape and reach our goals. Many treasures on each page. Thanks for the book it's an easy read and packed full of something that everyone can use.
0553801503|1.0|After 4,000 pages and 14 years, this is where we are?  Really?  The book was too big so we've split it into two parallel books?  Again, really?    The first three books were outstanding.  Time to start getting some resolution here.  Get on with it or pull the plug.
B0051QO4QY|5.0|Ok, so ive always liked Lady Gaga, but I was never a big fan.  This album is seriously blowing my mind! The beats and melodies mixed with dark and uplifting electronic beats are so purely enjoyable.  Can't really depict the best songs because everyone is going to like some more than the others according to their likes, but I'm really enjoying \\"Marry the Night\\" \\"Goverment Hooker\\" \\"Hair\\" and \\"Sheibe\\" but the other songs are great too! Some people are skeptical about this album simply by reading the tracklist.. its so weird! But honestly you just have to open up to the songs and enjoy for what they are and the stories they tell. Music, Passion, Gaga.
B0017T2NG2|4.0|The DaVinci Code was genius.  You can tell that it took a lot of thought and research to write it.  The book is full of fictional characters intertwined in a real life setting, describing actual places in detail.  I know the book was controversial, but if you think about the geniusness that went into the book, you can just enjoy it and it doesn't matter whether you believe in its content or not. It _is_ a fictional book.  I think The DaVinci code proves the brilliance of Dan Brown.
1594202842|1.0|I'm a montessorian and as such, I believe in a very child-centered and holistic method for rearing and educating children. This woman practices an almost abusive style of parenting. They say that negative behaviour learned as a child can repeat itself as an adult. Children learn the bulk of what they know through modeled behaviours. How very unfortunate, this does seem to be the case.
B00000JPH6|1.0|Ouch - I bought this thinking that my kids would enjoy it.  I had fond memories of this being a fun show, a little strange, but good for little kids.  Oh my this was so bad - my 8 year old was rolling his eyes after 3 min into the film, that past week has been then talking about how bad the acting, and special effects were in this show.  Definately not a high point in Jim Henson's portfolio.  Better left as a fun childhood memory, because if you watch it now the happy feeling will be gone.
0307595579|5.0|I purchased this set for my husband as a Father's day gift. I can hardly wait to give it to him because I want to read all of Stieg Larsson's books, and this boxed set is a perfect way to get all three books in a nice presentation.     The books came well packaged and are an attractive addition to our library.  I feel this is a good value for my money.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I like it so far ,,, but it feels heavy on your head when you keep using it for 30mins or 1 hour ~ not that heavy but keep in mind you will feel the weight on your head , but everything else is amazing :) .<br /><br />Edit: After using it for 2-4 days~ i feel it more comfortable on my head .
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I enjoyed it. Thought it was a decent super hero flick that didn't get bogged down too badly in the teenie bopper puppy love crap that seems to kill so many films these days. Wasn't too cheesy on the action and the effects were solid. Worth the rental for sure. Hope they make the sequel.

1608870081|5.0|I am a huge Harry Potter fan, and have been since I was 9 (now I'm 21) and I loved this pop-up book. Everything is numbered and labeled for you, plus it comes with some extra goodies.
B003JZT2AW|5.0|This is the package that fanatics, newbies and even those who \\"gave up\\" after 'What's the Story Morning Glory' will all appreciate. Disk 4 features their last recorded show (which demonstrated how really, really good they were even at the end). You also get on Disk 3 a wide-ranging music video set that smartly brings the studio version of \\"Acquiesce\\" into the mix. Those who stopped listening after 'Morning Glory' can see why although the mid and later albums may have not been as good, the singles often were.  \\"The Hindu Times\\", \\"I'm Outta Time\\", \\"Go Let it Out\\" -- all have that quality of sounding like some unearthed masterpiece by an imaginary British supergroup. What one realises after hearing most of the best of Oasis is that the band not only stood on the shoulders of giants (to borrow from one of their album titles) but were THEMSELVES giants. The imaginary supergroup isn't imaginary at all.  It's them, channeling our collective musical memories of Beatles, Kinks, stadium-rocking Who, T. Rex, Sex Pistols, Hollies/Easybeats singalong pop and \\"Rust\\"-era Neil Young into a mythic musical persona of their own.    The main reason why I give the deluxe collection five stars is that there are so few artists capable of even hoping to assemble such a massive and memorable body of work.    What's missing?  This is a UK a-side singles collection with additional video and concert material. Therefore you won't hear the original versions (and in some cases any version) of \\"Champagne Supernova\\", \\"Don't Go Away\\", \\"Listen Up\\", \\"Underneath the Sky\\", \\"Step Out\\", \\"I Hope I Think I Know\\", \\"Where Did it All Go Wrong\\" or \\"Roll it Over.\\"  Those were either b-sides, album tracks, promotional radio singles or non-UK singles. (Note that \\"Acquiesce\\" is present only because of the promotional video for the earlier compilation 'Stop the Clocks.') Too bad, because \\"Don't Go Away\\" in its original version stands as one of the greatest rock vocal performances of all time by any band, and \\"ListenUp\\" in my view is absolutely timeless. However, these missing pieces of the puzzle demonstrate that the biggest part of the Oasis story wasn't in the singles but on their albums, b-sides and live performances.    Have no doubt: There are brilliant television performances, unused b-sides and various other items sitting in the vault. Those will have to wait for another day.
0553062182|3.0|The book seems to drag out and be boring, but there is some interesting information that I have never read elsewhere.
0525422943|5.0|it was a great sequel to if i stay even though it was not exactly how i would've thought it would be written.  the story is told from Adam's perspective we don't hear much about Mia in the beginning of the book.  to not give away to much the ending was sweet and i absolutely recommend this book to anyone who's read if i stay and anyone who hasn't read that should because it (and they) are some of the best books
B0028K31CE|5.0|Don't listen to this CD with the ears for Maxwells previous work, you won't get it and may not understand it.  This album is a reflection of some of Maxwells most creatively inspired work yet.  For me this album reveals a coming home for Maxwell and a moving into the truth of who he really is and possibly was.  The smooth, cool, heart throb of the 90's (with side burns)that we came to know through some of his most popular songs, was much, much, much more than that.  This album is a deep, soulful, renedition, experience and journey of his truer song and style.  The instruments are real to begin with, which takes the sound to a whole new different level, which is authentic.  This is the kind of album that is timeless and the songs get better and better each time you listen to them and begin to understand what is being presented and most of all expressed.  You will thorougly love this album as you hear it, over and over again.  A long awaited experience, which we are glad is still here...
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I loved this book. I wouldnt have known about this author unless it showed in my Kindle suggestions. The author has set us up for another book to come in this series and I cant wait for that to happen. This is a different look at witches and vampires and I think its brillant.

B003UESJIS|5.0|When you see a movie by Mike Leigh, you expect a film with a minimum of plot, a quiet, deliberate pace and characters who are quite ordinary human beings; people we know, or even us.  Yet, despite the absence of gunfire, explosions or overly dramatic sequences, you find yourself mesmerized, completely drawn into the lives of these emotionally damaged characters.<br /><br /> ANOTHER YEAR(2010), which earned Leigh an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, is no different.<br /><br /> Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) have been married for over thirty years and have the quintessential happy marriage.  He's an engineer and she's a counselor.  Together they serve as a steady anchor to their unmarried circle of family and friends, including Mary (Lesley Manville), Gerri's alcoholic, overly needy co-worker, who desperately wants to find her \\"Prince Charming\\" (but never will).  In fact, at one point, she fantasizes that Tom and Gerri's grown son, considerably her junior, might fulfill that dream for her.  When he turns up with his beautiful young girl friend, Mary is devastated.<br /><br /> Mary's storyline dominates this engrossing drama about the vicissitudes of family and friendship, following the lives of these characters over a one-year period.<br /><br /> Ms. Manville is brilliant as a woman \\"drowning in quicksand,\\" who cannot help herself and, by film's end, is simply tolerated by her friends.  The final lonely image of her, sitting at a table full of happy people, is unforgettable.<br /><br /> ANOTHER YEAR is available in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo-pack from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  Extras include audio commentary by Leigh and Manville, a \\"Making of\\" featurette and a short documentary about Mike Leigh.<br /><br />© Michael B. Druxman
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great game.  EVO 4g. lots of fun.  the game keeps adding new weapons to keep it fresh. highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|easy to use and play on my Droid incredible. its carthotic at times, LOL. fun fun fun!!! I would buy again and recommend to a friend.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Dont bother downloading unless you have a TON of space available on your phone. 70mb file is just way too much!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've loved Plants vs. Zombies since it first came out, but I've only played it on my desktop gaming-PC. So, I was a bit worried about mobile version. I was delighted to find that it runs just as smoothly on my Thunderbolt as it does on my gaming set up. I am curious about Amazon using wireless rather than 4g, my phone is sooo much faster than my wireless network.
B004K4AVAG|1.0|I would like to explain why I'm disappointed in Lady Gaga's latest release.   I grew up in the 1980s. I can remember an interview with Freddie Mercury in which he was asked about Queen's formerly outrageous get ups. In the 1970s Queen needed something that would get them noticed, and wild costumes and makeup accomplished the task. However, behind the costumes and makeup was an immensely talented band. Queen delivered the goods time after time, and eventually what the band looked like did not matter. Freddie stated that he knew he and his band mates looked ridiculous, but their ability to create music could win people over. This was the case with many talented artists of the 1970s and 1980s. Prince, Grace Jones, Cyndi Lauper, and Michael Jackson all had an element of  \\"strangeness\\" to them, yet their talent was able to overshadow that element (expect for later in MJ's career).    Sadly, what Lady Gaga has delivered in Born this Way is style over substance. When Gaga debuted The Fame she delivered a style of popular music, which had not been seen since the 1980s. It was catchy, one could dance to it, and Gaga did something most singers cannot do any more-- she sang! Not only did she sing on the album, but also she dared to sing live in concert and did it well. Each track on The Fame seemed to be its own creation. So well planned and construed the artist's talent could not be over looked. Lady Gaga ruled the charts in 2008, and she continued her reign the following year with the release of The Fame Monster. \\"Bad Romance\\" is easily one of the greatest dance/pop songs recorded by any artist, and the album was filled with another batch of great songs. Clearly her image was a marketing ploy, yet Gaga had proven herself worthy of being called a star. Yet, the focus and talent Gaga delivered on her previous efforts is missing on Born this Way.    The album starts off well enough with \\"Marry the Night\\", which is an all right song if one is into the club scene and doesn't careto appreciate an artist's singing abilities. The title track is a given and I admit I'm quite fond of it. However, after that the album goes down hill at a rate I could not have anticipated. The endless thumping on every single track was overwhelming to say the least, and the ballads were so lack luster I'm not sure what purpose they served. In short, this is not the type of album I would expect a proven artist to deliver so early in her career. Born this Way seems to be more about the artist's ego than anything else... It seems Lady Gaga's fame (i.e. being strange) is more important to her than showcasing her musical abilities.    Sincerely,  A Former Little Monster
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Game works great on lg optimus s, presumably will do same with similar models, but that 74mb download is straight to internal memory, not sd card, so youll probably need to delete stuff until you have enough room. Loads slow too but in game plays great once youre in. game is a 5 star but a 1 star for setup and load times, so overall I give it 3 star. You CAN move to sd card after install and knocks down the space from 74mb to about 760k thankfully, but popcap should have made sd card install the default option, definitely a shoddy first effort for them on android.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game, and it seems like a perfect port. Playa well on a Thunderbolt. However, glitches and loads each time I get a text while playing. Great free app though!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can't believe how many negative reviews I read today just because a certain phone isn't supported. Guess what, they make the game so they get to pick what they want to run it! You don't think they considered not supporting the, arguably, most popular Android phone around? Get over it. They shouldn't let people leave reviews unless they've actually ran the app on the phone, I don't know how that would be done but just clicking \\"I want it\\" shouldn't give you reviewing rights. On to my review:    It worked perfectly on a bone stock Motorla Xoom and a custom Gingerbread ROM on a Droid X. Graphics looked fine and sounds were good. Game is fun and there's a reason we've been wanting it on Android so badly. So if you can go play it on your phone then enjoy! If not, then find it on the other 40 formats and play it there.
B0019GO5DC|5.0|I love the 80's indcluded a small soundtrack that was awesome. This was a gift for my best friend and she said that she wants to start collecting all of the \\"I love the 80's\\" movies.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I heard about this game a while ago (heard it was good). I'm glad I got it for free because it is soo boring. I gave it 2 because a 5 star game would be Modern Combat 2 or equivalent.  This is just a repetitive dumbed down tower defense game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Dl'ed and installed without a hitch on my Optimus S works great. A great game at an even better price (FREE)
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The developers really screwed up and didn't think about people playing in tablets. The game looks horrible. Thank goodness it's free!

B0041VV03A|3.0|I was not real impressed with this movie. Had great special effects, the acting was reasonable, it just wasnt quite what I expected. A great Rent to see movie but I myself would not buy it outright. Rent it, if you like it - then buy it. Not everyone  s taste in entertainment is the same - so you may actually like this science fiction movie.
B001QWQJ4W|3.0|This movie okay. I think it is the worst of the Fast and Furious series. I had never seen it before. None of the original people were in this film until the very end.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|Man, never before have I seen such a varied audience reaction for an Amazon product.  1 star, 2 star, 3 star, 4 star, and 5 star reviews all by the exact same number of people.<br /><br />Here's what I think happened.  I think the movie set out to be a special effects superhero blockbuster, but then realized it didn't really have much character in the protagonist to build on, and so it wisely figured to cut the funding necessary to be a blockbuster.  With a cut budget, it padded much of the movie with a romantic teeny-bopper subplot, and saved all the good action-packed special-effect stuff until the very end.  I bet it made a good profit too.  Just not as much as the even more mediocre Roger Corman movies (percentage-wise and adjusted for inflation).<br /><br />Definitely mediocre, but as my fiancee said, it's worth a buck to see.
B0050N8N0Q|3.0|I like this album, but I am really not in love with the fact that I just payed $8 for it.  The titles on the \\"Foster the People EP\\" make up 1/3 of the full length album (verbatim... no re-mastered or re-mixed tracks here), and they are BY FAR the best tracks on \\"Torches\\".      I'm left with a feeling akin to when a movie preview shows all the funniest jokes in a film... especially when I consider that the 3-track EP (Houdini, Pumped Up Kicks, and Helena Beat) cost me $5 on Amazon (a practically unheard-of per-song price).    In conclusion:   - If you own the \\"Foster the People EP,\\" DO NOT pay full price for \\"Torches\\".   - If you've never heard of Foster The People, buy Torches and ignore whatever else you see out there.    My frustrations aside, Foster The People has put together some great tracks and I look forward to seeing where they go from here.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|I can't help comparing this movie with the story of another crazy girl who damages herself in her pursuit of perfection, an old story known as The Bell Jar.  There's one thing in this movie that I don't remember from The Bell Jar though that might explain the girl's overambition a bit better, and that is the driving force of the mother.  No wonder this poor ballerina went nuts.  She had an insane mother, an insane teacher, and an insane female dance partner (for lack of a better term).  The mother drove the ambition in the first place, the teacher purposely nourished it further and led to its distortion, and the dance partner fulfilled the distortion by feeding her the wrong messages.  It's really quite brilliantly weaved together for being as ugly as it is.<br /><br />The one way in which this really differs from The Bell Jar is the ending, but other than that, I can't point out too many major differences.  I wish I could remember the driving force that made the girl in The Bell Jar so unable to handle failure, but I just can't.  I think as I read the book, I simply assumed the driving force was just the societal pressures of the day to succeed academically (which is far worse now than it was in the 60's).  All I know is I got past my first truly epic failure years ago, so I shouldn't be in this sort of danger.  Hooray for EPIC FAIL!
B004EPYZOO|4.0|Okay, director Patrick Lussier of Dracula 2000, My Bloody Valentine, a few others, and now Drive Angry-this may be your best work yet, imo, at least. Nicholas Cage plays a man who returns from Hell(with a vengence) to find his granddaughter, who's been kidnapped by a satanic cult, at any cost. Nothing in this movie is hard to follow, but then I don't mind complex, most of the time. William Fichtner known only as the Accountant, obviously from Hell, but who's he really working for, hmmm...? If you like supernatural thrillers/ with alot of action, and aren't too closed minded to handle the language and sexual content, give this a shot, you may be surprised, I was more impressed than expected, the influence of Quentin Tarintino is all over this film, the dialogue, the camera work, and the charecters. Still reading? For those who are, give this movie a chance, being a Nicholas Cage fan doesn't hurt either, enjoy!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Saw that this app was free for a day and figured i might try it.  I had some trouble with first getting the amazon appstore app downloaded to my device(HTC Inspire) because it is on the AT&T network, I went another route.  and now after some searching for instructions on bypassing the locks, it works just fine on my HTC Inspire. I'm hoping AT&T and Amazon will start working together to allow the downloading of apps.<br /><br />since this is not being installed from the android market website it must be \\"sideloaded.\\" to do this, Google \\"Amazon App Store: How to install on Inspire\\" should be the first link from a site called androidcentral.com. I believe these instructions should work for any android device and the installation of any app not on the android market, but I am not sure.<br /><br />follow these instructions to get the appstore installed and it is pretty much the same way for the games and such. good luck. hope this helps.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|\\"Ukulele Songs\\" is an odd but charming little album. Eddie Vedder sings and plays the Aloha State's signature instrument on 14 brief tracks (a 15th cut is the sweet instrumental fragment \\"Waving Palms,\\" and a 16th cut, \\"Hey Fahkah,\\" is just a false start and a swear word). The whole program lasts a mere 35 minutes. If Vedder's tremulous baritone and the whispery strum of a solo ukulele are sounds you enjoy in isolation, then you'll be pleased by their combination on this very spare set. \\"Sad songs on a happy instrument\\" is how he describes them. The two actually complement one another quite well, just as they did on \\"Rise\\" from his 2007 soundtrack for the film \\"Into the Wild.\\"<br /><br />Most of the songs are wistful Vedder compositions, including the first track, an acoustic cover of Pearl Jam's \\"Can't Keep,\\" which brings to mind \\"Soon Forget\\" from their 2000 album \\"Binaural.\\" He also throws in four Tin Pan Alley tunes dating from the 1920s and 30s: \\"More Than You Know,\\" \\"Once in a While,\\" \\"Tonight You Belong to Me\\" (backed by Chan Marshall of Cat Power), and \\"Dream a Little Dream of Me.\\" Glen Hansard of The Swell Season joins in on \\"Sleepless Nights,\\" the first single, and \\"Longing to Belong\\" - one of my favorites - features a cello, but the rest of this low-key hum-along is just Eddie and his uke. The playing is pleasant if unspectacular, but that's appropriate, since the focus here is on the songs. Eddie Vedder is a very good ukuleleist, but he's no Jake Shimabukuro.<br /><br />I liked this outing a lot. I have eclectic tastes, a fondness for all things Hawaiian, and considerable respect for Vedder. Evidently a very personal project, the album has a soothing, hypnotic feel. It's certainly not going to please everyone, and it will probably trigger anything from boredom to consternation among those fans expecting a grungy howl-fest instead of Eddie unplugged. But I'm sure he's not worried in the least. He's always been an iconoclast, more concerned with being true to himself than to anyone's expectations, and he's never shied away from risk or controversy. For that I admire him all the more. If you were hoping for a Pearl Jam release, though, console yourself with the fact that the whole crew is in the studio right now recording a new one.an to anyone's expectations, and he's never shied away from risk or controversy.

B004289ZW0|1.0|I bought this to add GPS functionality to my iPad 2. I would use it to assist with in flight navigation. I noticed that it would turn itself on, and that I could never turn it off. Finally, I had problems with it getting Bluetooth connection to the iPad. I got so frustrated I took it apart to try and figure out what was going on. Basically, what I found was the touch sensor is poorly designed and will short out the Bluetooth LED thus loosing its connection to the iPad. The only way that I could get this unit to operate is to take out the metal pads used for the touch sensors and turn it on and off using wall/car power, and by turning off the Bluetooth on the iPad. This IMO is less than ideal. I am currently looking into another solution to get better reliability and ease of use.

It was a nice break from the typical \\"Princesses,\\"  as Rapunzel can hold her own!  Overall i thought the characters were great.  Mandy Moore was awesome as Rapunzel.  If you're looking for something a little different, i recommend this film!

Thumbs down waste of time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|been waiting for this app to come to the android side. downloaded it and works great on my android htc 4. please read their info about not working on some phones. those that rated it low did not read their notes on which phones it will work for. game plays great. images/pixels are also great. no lag or skips. played to level 5 before submitting this review. very pleased with the app.
B00127RAJY|5.0|[[ASIN:B00127RAJY Jillian Michaels - 30 Day Shred]]  My daughter told me about this video and the first thing I thought was...I don't need to lose any weight.  But with her persistence I purchased it.  WOW! What a workout! I get the much needed cardio and I'm starting to see the toning up of this 57 year old body! I'm still maintaining my weight but things are shifting and firming! I'm really starting to feel a lot better too, more energy. LOVE IT!!  When you start you think you are going to die and can't go on but Jillian encourages you through the whole thing! Whatever you do don't give up!!  I can see where this will help those who want to lose weight also....portion control and this video workout you'd definitely see results!
B003UESJHE|4.0|Not one special effect in the entire 2 hours, just fantastic dialogue well written with a deserving award performance by Colin Firth. Which real life events are ultimately more important to history this or The Social Network is debatable, one subject changed their communication the other changed ours. The latter is the better of the two films while the former is a more encouraging story.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The product crashed my phone and it won't respond even though it is not mentioned in the list of incompatible devices.  Don't buy it.
0307702413|5.0|This book is extremely entertaining despite the tragedy of its subject. It's a real page-turner (though I listened to the audio version). I learned a lot about financial transactions that I had never fully understood. The author explains these, ones frequently mentioned in the news, very simply and thoroughly. For the entertainment and educational values alone, the book is superb.<br /><br />Some of the book reviews complain that the author focuses too much on his own autobiography and accomplishments. I'm interested in people, and I found that these sections helped me to understand the subject of the book, by getting a better understanding of the type of person who becomes a Wall Street trader. Plus, they were fascinating.<br /><br />I have no inside knowledge of what really happened at Lehman, but I find the author's account quite credible and likely. Of course, for any historic event, it's good to read a multitude of accounts.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I was wanting to get into this game and was glad to see that it was free. It works great on my Droid X. Fast and responsive controls with good graphics and addictive gameplay.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is one of the most memorable games you will ever play. I frankly don't understand why this game isn't rated at a solid 5 stars, it's incredibly fun and cute, and worth every penny several times over. I've been waiting for this to finally hit the Android! Don't pass this title up and I guarantee you won't regret it!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|this is a great game and it runs fine on my droid x.  I love the negative reviews for incompatibility when it says in the description that it is incompatible
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This app will be free after 2am! Just cause it's midnight doesn't mean that's when it's supposed to automatically switch to the free app of the day!<br /><br />Anyway, AWESOME game!!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|App starts and lets me enter my name (in an anonymous text box with no label) but then nothing works. I get the opening screen but there are no touch controls and I have to kill the app. Running gTablet with TNTLite. Sad, usually gTablet and Xoom have about the same app compatibility.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Only played the first few levels, but just as fun as the other versions! Nice control scheme, too. Sweet graphics ;)
B004K4AUZW|4.0|With \\"Born This Way\\", Lady Gaga officially puts to rest the idea that she is simply Madonna version 2.0 with a dash of Grace Jones, Cher, Marilyn Manson, etc thrown in.<br /><br />\\"Born This Way\\" offers a unique, almost bizarre, pastiche of genres. Gaga manages to meld eurodisco, arena rock, and showtunes all together. Love it or hate it, \\"Born This Way\\" is an original piece of work; there isn't anyone else out there that I know of making music like this, and if they are, they certainly aren't a pop superstar.<br /><br />For the most part, I like it. And even the tracks I don't care much for, I can still appreciate the creativity and earnestness. Thematically, the album title reveals it all ... it's about being yourself. And Gaga is trying, maybe even a little too hard, to be everything that she is on this record. The album is the opposite of minimalist or streamlined ... it's a loud, bombastic, garish, often joyful and occasionally brilliant affair.<br /><br />Highlights: \\"Government Hooker\\", \\"Bloody Mary\\" \\"Bad Kids\\" \\"Electric Chapel\\", \\"You and I\\"
B00538LHGU|5.0|As of this writing (May 28, 2011), Best Buy exclusively sells the Blu-ray release of the 1994 western/comedy/action movie \\"Maverick\\"--and the BD is definitely a huge improvement over the DVD video and audio. If you own the DVD of this movie (and have watched it on a large-screen, HD TV), you know that the DVD transfer was simply awful--almost unwatchable due to the heavy grain and other video defects.    The upgrade to Blu-ray is definitely worth the additional purchase price (less than thirteen dollars at Best Buy). It's like watching a totally different movie. The BD video is sharp, skin tones are perfect, and the color saturation is rich (but still looks natural). I rate the video transfer as 8/10--a solid transfer, especially for an \\"older\\" film. The audio is equally impressive--almost like watching a new release.    The film itself is, of course, quite entertaining--wonderful cast (Mel Gibson, Jodie Foster, James Colburn, James Garner, Graham Greene, and Alfred Molina), breath taking cinematography (filming took place at a number of scenic locations in the American West including Yosemite National Park, the Columbia River in Oregon, and the Arizona desert), a crazy plot (it's basically a comedy involving a big poker game aboard a fancy river boat--but there is plently of action), cameos by a number of country western singers (who perform a fantastic rendition of \\"Amazing Grace\\" as the ending credits roll) and a PG-13 rating, so the whole family can watch it.     This upgrade to Blu-ray is highly recommended!
0307454541|5.0|I heard the positive reviews buzzing about this book...Normally I'm skeptical of following the masses but so very glad I did this time...I've begun the third book of this trilogy, pacing myself not wanting it to end. If you want  refreshing, entertaining, intellegent, clever, politics, money, violence, mystery, sex, characters with character....then this is the book/series that will deliver that and more! It will without a doubt be series I intend to reread and highly recommend:-) ENJOY!
B0052U59F4|5.0|Love the story!  As for the review of 1 star...   Have you not read published alternate pride and prejudice stories????  Love the story and can't wait for the next parts!!!
9889979942|5.0|Mr. Carter's work is nothing short of spectacular.  Armed with a basic point-and-shoot and a determination like no other, he has produced a masterpiece.  Get this book!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Hangs on various points during startup.  After many attempts in killing and restarting the app (and wiping the data), was never able to start a single game.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This sucks! I get all excited that my favorite game is now available for my Droid and guess what. It isn't compatible with my original Droid!. C'mon, my phone isn't that old!
B004IQMXD4|1.0|Her best yet? Come on.  I'm not a musician so I can't speak to the music, but the lyrics sound like they were rushed and put down without thought.  They are trite, careless, and for a 63 year old woman, somewhat juvenile.  One would expect more depth.  All in all - quite boring.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is really fun. I played it a lot on my iPod Touch. It is a great game and it is free today.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|absolute great game...BUT...why does it need to &quot;modify battery statistics&quot;? that makes no sense at all, I really wish dev's were required to explain quirky permissions
B0052UZIFA|1.0|App crashes every time I open it. I have a droid x2. Would be nice if this got fixed in the near future.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally! Game runs smoothly on my G2x.  This game is a fun and addictive tower defense game.  The soundtrack is catchy.  This game has high replay value.
B004K4AVAG|2.0|straight up Ga Ga has musical chops, she can play, can sing and understands melody and Groove, however alot of this album as with some of her other material at times comes off as Karoke style Madonna leftovers and feels contrived and when her imagery takes center stage you are stuck with a well skilled artist who is polished in the manipulation of selling a image,which leaves the music at hand cold and calculated.  she has real talent,however the gimmicks at times tend override and if she keeps putting out half baked songs which just are rethreads of madonna and countless other acts then she will be done before she has a chance to truly shine. she got a chance to really be something as a artist if she works on real songs.
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I have never written a review before, but this book irritated me.  Entirely too much internal dialogue.  All 6 books leading up to this one were forward moving, action packed, weaving new sub-plots... not this one.  Like other reviewers I grew really tired of Mac and her immaturity (even though she tried to evolve out of it), and such strong emotions being dumped all together.  The emotional roller coaster finally made me motion sick.  I got really tired of the inside of Mac's head.  Dont \\"tell\\" me how she feels, \\"show\\" me how she feels.  And frankly, after 27 pages, i really \\"don't give a frog.\\"  Actually, halfway through the last book I really didn't care what happened to anyone.  Not a good sign after 6 books (which I loved).   I think the series went too long, so the amount of backtracking that had to be done to allow for people who are too lazy to start at the beginning got really tiring.  I felt the for-shadowing for Barrows return was heavy handed so I didn't mourn his death at all, I just thought \\"You Idiot!  He TOLD you don't expect things to die!\\" and then was frustrated that she didn't hang around and defend his body so it wasn't eaten by the locals. If this was someone I cared so much for, and I thought there was the slightest chance he could come back, i would stand there spear in hand until his head rotted off. Highly unbelievable character actions.  I so loved the Highlander series that I was super happy she wove the characters into this one. I was glad to hear from the MacKeltars and Adam and all them.    In all, I felt the story ended too abruptly, slamming on the brakes and throwing me into the dashboard. I leave the series battered, bruised and sorely needing a dramamine.
0061122416|5.0|There are beautiful messages for people that are wishing to look at hings in life from the positive prospective. Why is it important for many to be negative? Univerce always has an answer and I think probably without the negative we are not able to appreciate the positive. Great book, read it, enjoy it, be inspired and use it as the learning instrument. All the best!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|if people would learn to read the product info you would have seen it is not compatible with your Droid! its a great game and deserving of its high rating don't one star because your hardware wont run it
0307279189|5.0|To be honest, I found Born To Run a fun, enjoyable and quick read.  Before this book there was no way that I would ever imagine doing a marathon, or an ultramarathon.  Now, that has become a possibility.  I remember as a kid the effortless running up and down on the grass, the sand, the ball field.  I have not done any of THAT kind of running in many decades.  I don't know where this will all lead, but I plan on taking it slowly and learning a \\"new way\\" of running - on the balls of my feet.      After reading this book, I read the Amazon one-star reviews and I found them to be quite harsh in judgement against Chris McDougall.  I find these criticisms to be unjustified.  His writing style allows the story to of the Tarahumara and the big race to unfold.  Yes, there are digressions and sidebars but these support the main story.  I did not particular care for the chapter on the \\"Running Man\\" theory but it can be easily skipped-by to get back to the race.  I only wish McDougall had spent more time telling us about the Tarahumara.    I found this story and this book to be both enthralling and fascinating.  I think you will too, if you are a runner or dream of being a runner.  One thing is for sure:  reading this book makes you want to go out and run!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|What a great game to port over! Animations, sounds, everything is great.<br /><br />What's with the Amazon App Store kicking me off of 4g to use WiFi? My cable modem is slower than 4g!!! (no stars off, not the game's fault!)
0307887960|4.0|For the most part this has been an easy diet to follow.  Have lost 12 pounds so far on the Dukan diet and 41 over all.  Still have a few to go.
1563892278|5.0|I'll admit I was a tad apprehensive for no reason at all, I suppose I can be somewhat critical when it comes to a good story. I define a good story as one i liked, The Sandman by Neil Gaiman is to be loved. It is a wonderful journey and continues on to the end.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|This was a very enjoyable movie.  Although it seemed to get just a tiny bit slow in the first half, it still kept me tied to the screen.  The conductor of a train makes a stupid mistake and leaves a moving train for just a second.  The internal switches slip and it becomes a runaway train, gradually increasing speeds.  It just so happens that there are several cars of a toxic substance on the runaway train.<br /><br />Denzel Washington plays a veteran train engineer (of 28 years I think) who knows the tricks of the trade that you cannot find in books.  Chris Pine (of Star Trek) plays a young conductor.<br /><br />Realistically, I don't know why they could not have fixed the situation earlier in the movie, except that it was written in the script that way.  STILL, I enjoyed it.  It also touches on dumb management decisions, management arrogance, and the stupidity of a company wanting to get rid of older, experienced workers so they can hire younger ones (probably at a lower salary and less benefits).<br /><br />The plot takes place in Pennsylvania and is said to be based on true events.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|On stock htc evo with froyo, this app is working without issue. Make sure you have plenty of free space on your main app storage as it is over 70 MB. You can move it to sd after the install to free up the space again.
0316098329|3.0|The reviews were so good that perhaps I expected too much.  The first half of the book was pretty good, but I pretty quickly tired of Jack's broken and inconsistent language.  I was less impressed with the second half of the book.  The characters didn't seem to have consistent personalities, and I didn't find it all that believable.  A really great book (to me) makes you care about the characters, and by the end of the book I just didn't. I bet it would be great for a book club- lots to discuss.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I really hate to join the ranks of Amazonites giving this one star, but seriously? No Motorola DROID support? I've seen a few people comment that the DROID and DROID 2 have (or should have) the same exact functionality and capability. I'm inclined to agree, though from the standpoint of someone that isn't an expert with the innards of these phones.    It's a shame too, because I've played Plants vs. Zombies on PC and Xbox 360, and it's fun as hell! But nope. I don't get that pleasure on the go. I hope they fix this and make it able to store on SD card if it isn't already. Pop Cap really alienated a huge Android fanbase with this move.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Seems like this game is incompatible with quite a few Android phones. It won't let me download on T-Mobile's MyTouch 3G either.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I bought my wife the PC version of this game years ago, and wouldn't you know, it's still a blast tp play! Now i can get it on my Droid X... and for free? Oh, man, I'll never get anything done now! fyi works great on Droid X
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great, loads fast on my HTC Merge. Just wished people would stop rateing apps 1 star when their phone is old as dirt. Stop whining and go out and buy a better phone. Thanx Amazon for makeing it free!!!!!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game never fails me, no matter the platform I'm playing it on! An excellent time killer for anyone! Great job as usual.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Good Things:<br />Fun game<br />Same game-play as on my Xbox<br />The game supports move to sdcard (it is 75MB and after installing I got a low space notification. So make sure to use this feature)<br />Game appears very responsive except for some level ending animations.<br /><br />Bad Things:<br />Some animations appear slow on both my Xoom and my EVO.<br />Game assets seem to be slightly lowered resolution and overall things just do not have that rich animated look that you maybe used to on other platforms.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />PvZ works on both my HTC EVO and my Motorola Xoom although the game looks very pixelated on my Xoom and it looks as though they are using the same resolution assets for both my Xoom and my EVO.<br /><br />I gave this game five stars simply for the game-play which is excellent.
0307887960|1.0|(Can't post links for some reason)    Notice how I make sure I punctuate with ample interrogation marks. The author of this book has already sued a doctor back in his home country of France for having said in a magazine that the Dukan Diet is dangerous due to the low carb/high protein intake (Le Monde, \\"Régime Dukan: Alertez François Hollande!\\"). So I won't take any chances for an Amazon review. The verdict has not been announced as of today but in the meantime, a study has been released by the French health authorities pointing out the dangers of hi-carb diets (Anses). This is all in french as the original book is in french and it's starting to cause a stir over there.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I know this game is awesome, but... it was next to impossible to download and now that it is finally installed it will not open. Once PopCap updates this to work for Android phones they will get their 3 extra stars.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|As good as the first time on TV.  This is a smart, funny tv series that ended far too soon.  Aaron Sorkin is the best writer for fast paced shows with smart humor and non-stop dialog.  From the first show of the first year, the cast has charisma and work well together.  As the seasons go on, you find yourself routing for this presidency and the West Wing people as if they are real.  This is one of the best TV series to ever aired and is worth watching over and over again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|really love the gameplay, but I wish the transitions were faster. OMG China! its plants vs zombies! get at it while its free! i would pay for it though
0060989157|5.0|M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e is the most notorious rock band in the world for three \\"basics\\": sex, drugs, and rock and roll. While reading this book I was amazed, blown away, and shocked at  how much enjoyment I got out of this, not only for the pure reason that, yes M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e does know how to read and write, but further being able to write a band autobiography with the addition about their lives and how things got started and all that jazz. If you are a fan of M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e, you will enjoy this book thoroughly, especially if you do not know all of the background information about them. You will be going down the crazy road of the world of M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e.<br /><br />Some of the people who have posted reviews about his book do not agree with my opinion, such as \\"A Customer\\" saying that it's just about the typical rock and roll band that starts out high and then develops drug addictions, then become washed out.  I disagree with this because they are not washed out, they still have a very large fan base, are still recording albums, and also they do know how to write. They made me feel very emotional about certain things that are in the book. This book was very entertaining to me, but mostly because I enjoy M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e's music and I find stories that they tell very interesting. And my opinion would have to lie with \\"M.Grant\\" because he nailed it; everything that he said is so true. I also enjoyed the methods of influence some of the guys had, such as Nikki's association of his wretched family and how he was kicked out, abused, and hated by both of his parents, with how he came to live just for each day. These influences really brought him to talk about why he started to abuse drugs, and how he really ended up meeting the other three members of the Cr&uuml;e.<br /><br />Once again though, if you have any slight interest in this band, I suggest picking this book up, because I found what they talked about in this book hilarious and interesting in a very sick way.<br /><br />Senior English Student 2011
B003ZSJ212|2.0|Dear Mr. Lucas (and NOW DISNEY),<br />Just give us a beautiful, booming HD version of the ORIGINALS. Improved sound and video? YES. Removed matte lines and beautiful backgrounds? YES. New scenes, actor-swaps and ROTJ MUSICAL NUMBERS. NO, PLEASE NO!<br /><br />I eventually bought this set because I have a dumb side that savy businessmen can bank on, and I wanted to 'watch Star Wars on Blu Ray' and so here's the best we got.  It does have some nice picture and sound, and so it's hard for me to one-star the quality of the product, but is it what I really wanted?  No.  Now that Disney owns the franchise, maybe they'll see the chance for more money and give us the originals in all their beautiful glory.<br /><br />P.S. JEDI ROCK ANYONE?  Ugh.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Played on my Nook Color and Vibrant, both run well, with it looking gorgeous on the Vibrant, the Nook Color, eh, not so nice, but its not optimized for bigger screens(yet). For some people complaining of the graphics, I would say its more of your phone display than Pop Cap. It looks amazing on a SAMOLED screen, so it is going to depend on the screen. I would say playing on the bigger screen was easier, but it is still doable on my 4\\" screen. I can tell this game is demanding, so those with old phones, you are out of luck, and this also takes a good chunk of memory up, since when I exit, I am always reloading the homescreens, but thats not a big deal, I expect this game to be demanding. I definitely recommend for people who haven't played the game before on other platforms, and it is definitely an A+ Time Killer game.
B004RKXN44|5.0|Hawke's book has been highly anticipated by me since I first read Slave to Sensation, the first book in this wonderful Psy/Changeling series. Over the past year I've tried to subdue that anticipation as much as possible - sure that it could only lead to disappointment.<br /><br />I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />This is the story I've been waiting for. The sexual tension between Hawke and Sienna is nearly explosive. Hawke doesn't take too long to come around to the decision that his wolf has been pushing him towards - pursue Sienna. It might take a little creativity on Sienna's part, but once he does; Oh boy. There are a few `almost' moments, where Hawke and Sienna's courting is interrupted by everything from injuries to Psy scouting parties to outright attacks, and you could feel the frustration, as well as the responsibility in each of those moments.<br /><br />Hawke was the same alpha that I've always loved. The alpha who has feral wolves claiming him as their own alpha. In this dangerous war with the Psy, Hawke barely has time to set aside his responsibilities. So he never does. He and Sienna steal small moments, with the help of their Pack, and they don't give up on what they have together.<br /><br />Learning more about Sienna, and what she has grown up with, what she's grown up expecting - to die before she reaches 25 - was heart-wrenching at times. And yet she always managed to impress me with the way she's managed to become such a strong young woman. She is absolutely more than a match for Hawke. But she's so much more than a perfect match for him, she's a fierce, beautiful, determined, resourceful woman that's not afraid to take chances with her heart, and will protect those she cares about, no matter the cost to herself.<br /><br />There's an additional side story between Lara, SnowDancer's healer and Walker Lauren. It's an incredibly sweet story that I was happy to read. There's a lot of focus on the Lauren's in general in Kiss of Snow, with more of one of my favorite characters (Judd) showing up quite a bit too.<br /><br />By now there are around 50 distinct characters that we've met more deeply than passing by in Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling world. She continues to give each of them a voice that is solely their own. They act within their character all the time and are each noticeably different. Combine that with a world that continues to grow while following its own rules and Ms. Singh continues to blow away all my expectations.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow satisfied every one of my expectations, and then some. It's a sexy, sweet, enthralling story from beginning to end. I literally could not put it down from the moment I started it and was up late into the night inhaling this story. There's no end in sight for my love of Nalini Singh's writing, and I'm eagerly anticipating her next release.ore of one of my favorite characters (Judd) showing up quite a bit too.<br /><br />By now there are around 50 distinct characters that we've met more deeply than passing by in Nalini Singh's Psy/Changeling world.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|great game play and great graphics. finally available on android. so long angry birds! works great on my samsung fascinate.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Finally got this game on Android! How old is this game now? I remember playing on my laptop at least 2+ years ago. Better late than never! Can't download yet cause not on wifi. The game is huge, but I've seen much bigger from Gameloft. Not sure why people rate this low cause of its size, that's irrelevant to its quality and shouldn't affect its rating. If you have to complain about its size and no move to SD card then you need to get a job and buy a new phone. &quot;most new phones have large memory cards&quot; really? Most new phones also have several gigs of internal storage. My nearly year old droid x has 8gb &amp; even older droid incredible has about the same. I have yet to use half the available space, this is a drop in the bucket. Description also says may not look good on a tablet or work, so how can you rate low if that's the case with your xoom?<br />If you haven't heard of this game and actually are looking for a review then take these and all reviews on Amazon with a grain of salt. Most only take the time to review if there is something wrong (usually them not the app). This is a great game that is brand new to Android and may need to have bugs worked out.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|So far game works good. Other than the lagging of the end level graphics, the graphics are fine on my Nexus One and Nook Color.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is a long time coming. Works great on my phone. Thank you popcap for finally putting this in android.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Michael Jackson shows in this great movie that he is the most professional, loving, the most emotional, kindest populer music artist of the century. Whatever he does is magic. Even he stands on the scene and does nothing you can watch him forever. He is the grace and he is the \\"music\\" himself like the music is under his skin. And he gave this music as the most beautiful present for all the people in the world.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Downloaded fine over4G, runs great. huge install shrinks to 400k after moving to memory card.  more words are required to submit my review, so here are some more.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It gets to screen to input your name and freezes, can't log out or go to home screen, have to force a reboot. please fix.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Pop Cap delivers here again with a classic game for your android! I have been waiting quite a while for a mobile version of this game and it doesn't disappoint! It has a great feel compared to console versions of the game and has the same great music as well. I am running the game on a Droid X, no problems. If you are looking for a great strategy action game, this is the place to start!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have a T-Mobile G2 and the game runs pretty well on it but give me some better looking graphics. The game looks worse on my android than it does on my 3rd gen iTouch. I've played some really pretty games on here. Cmon popcap, I know I can up res your graphics!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I resent having emails sent to me, making offers and enticing me to download apps, only to find that the \\"free\\" offers are not available in Canada. I naively installed the Amazon App Store, was sent on an endless loop of entering my email address and password, and finally ended up being told to purchase the item. PVZ is a great game, even if you don't live south of the 49th parallel. I've uninstalled the Amazon app and labeled all future emails from Amazon as 'direct to spam.'
B0052UZIFA|3.0|doesn't scale perfectly for a tablet, making touching  the top of the screen a bit off but it works well snogged to be playable
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Great app! I love that the individual notes on your home screens can be quite small compared to the other note app's I have tried.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The personally addressed e-mail says \\"Available instantly for your Android device\\", but after installing the app store and trying to load the promised app it says \\"app store not available in your region\\". Couldn't they warn in advance? I hate this kind of provincial thinking.

0425242099|5.0|First of all, this is not the book with which to begin your love affair with the Psy-Changeling series. Do yourself a favor and start at the beginning. Relish the fact that you won't have to wait years for Hawke's book like the rest of us! If this book didn't move the arc of the story along, with a couple of surprises I never saw coming, I would swear this was a big, fat love letter from Nalini Singh to the fans. This is the book I wanted, hands down.    Very Brief Synopsis - Sienna is all grown up, and the tension between her and Hawke can no longer be ignored. Hawke resists, as Sienna is so young, and he feels he cannot give her all that she deserves. Sienna's power is growing. Meanwhile, our friends from the council, The Scott's, ratchet up their plans for domination of the San Francisco area. Lara and Walker have a nice secondary plotline. We get to spend quality time with members of both packs, especially Sascha and Lucas. The Ghost makes several critical appearances.    Impressions - We spend most of the book with Hawke and Sienna. SO GOOD! The build up toward the inevitable was a long, slow dance. It was sweet, it was sensual, it was playful and it was poignant. They actually developed a relationship before they got physical, which worked perfectly in light of Sienna's age and experience level. And once they finally got physical...!!!!!!!!!!!! HAWT !!!!!!!!! Once Hawke gave in to the idea that he wanted Sienna, he was fiercly dedicated to the cause. We got to know Hawke at a deep level, getting new insight into his personality and what made him the alpha he is. I ate it all up like candy. I always loved Hawke, from his first appearance in the series, his teasing of Lucas by flirtling with Sascha, but now, oh, wow....Hawke the Hero was everythng I wanted him to be. Smart, strong, caring, playful, sexy and determined.    Sienna is not your typical 19 year old. Pulled away from her family at the age of 5, she was Silent by age 9. Cultivated as a weapon by Ming,she has seen and done more than most people ever will, and it shows in her maturity level. Couple that with a Talent that, unleashed, could decimate entire continents, and she has had to learn self control. She has no control over her feelings for Hawke, though, and it hurts her to have him reject her out of hand. When she finally gets him, she's not quite sure what to do with him! LOL! But she is a willing pupil... I have to admit to being a little concerned about Sienna's age, but in light of her life experiences, it worked. Sienna was terrific. She didn't take any of Hawke's alpha posturing, standing up to him time and again. She is the perfect compliment to Hawke, strong and giving. She was willing to sacrifice herself for the good of the pack. I really liked how, when Sienna and Hawke's time together was interrupted due to pressing pack concerns, she immediately went into pack mode. She never made an issue of Hawke's committment to the pack. Instead, she stood beside him to help.     Walker, Sienna's uncle, finds himself drawn to the SnowDancer Pack's healer, Lara. We learn a lot about his background, and their story is so sweet. Walker has hidden depths and plays a crucial role.    There were some laugh out loud moments, such as Matthias stopping Hawke from chasing Sienna, telling Hawke that he is trying to preserve his dignity, and chasing women down corridors is simply not done! And Kit \\"helping\\" Sienna make Hawke jealous (Oh, now the wait is on for Kit's story...)    There are too many details that would be spoilers. Suffice it to say, if you are a Hawke fan, you will love this book.    The book really clips along. I read it in one sitting. I laughed, I cried and I cheered. The arc is advanced. You can sense the coming battle, and all of the pieces are being placed. We get more information about Sienna's talent, and there are some real surprises that, in hindsight, make sense. All in all, there was nothing I wanted that I didn't get, and I didn't get anything I didn't want. Kiss of Snow was a terrific reading experience for this fan. Nalini Singh, THANK YOU! from the bottom of my Hawke lovin' heart.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|When it clearly says that it won't work for the Droid phone, why would you write a negative review complaining that it doesn't work for your Droid phone? That is not helpful at all. You should instead spend your time getting fixed so you don't spread your stupid gene to future generations.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It works great on my Nexus S... fast smooth and it's very fun! The mistake is that it has no full tablet support... while a certain APK that has been leaked supports tablets perfectly.   Why? not a clue, the leaked APK works fine enough on my Xoom, but this works terribly on my Xoom, great on my Nexus.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on Motorola Xoom and HTC Thunderbolt!! very fun and addicting game, a must download for sure. Warning: massive file though  so make sure you have a phone that can handle it. I was so happy to find out this games runs perfect on MOTO Xoom, only lag's for a second after you beat a level that's it!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|it downloaded just fine but it fails to install.  looks like a bad port.  would give logs if I could.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|finally on android!!!!!!!!!!!yes, i have this game on my ipad too, great game as u know. nice work, guys.  i hope we getting more levels on this game.
B00521LT8O|3.0|It's been four days since \\"The Almost People\\" aired, I have a TV pass and no show.     This is a problem!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Video came on and stopped. Amazon free app for the is just that too, just for the day. will be deleting amazon from my phone.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|For a device that \\"is unlimited in what it can do\\" sure is funny it can't play PvsZ. Come on Popcap, my old flip phone could play Peggle just fine. Now that you are finally showing the Droid users some love, you are doing in the most lackluster way. I've never had a reason to hate on Popcap, until now. I've bought several versions of Peggle, PvsZ, ect. Now I think I'll just stick to the PC...if their games will support it.<br />Rated 1 only because broken products can't get a 0.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have a Samsung Facinate and I thought it didn't work because it made my phone restart but I reopened it and it worked great :) I have this game on my PC and I love it!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Hello guys,    This is my second review. I live in Tasmania, Australia and received this item today in the post.    For less than $10 this tool is an excellent buy. I own various other sharpeners and I know quite a lot about sharpening in general. I'd highly recommend this tool to carry in the field. Like most carbide sharpeners it may take a little excess steel off your edges so use it wisely and perhaps not on you best knives. It has carbide wheels and a diamond sharpener for serrations as well.    It REALLY is great quality, folks. It's darned well made and I'm positive it will last years. It's compact and portable and you can even attach a lanyard onto it. You can put it in your pocket and hardly know it's there. I will definitely order some more from Amazon as presents I'm that impressed with these things.    Do not hesitate! Go and buy at least one of these right now. Brilliant value, terrific quality and well designed. All this for less than 10 bucks!    I hope this has been helpful.    Regards  Paul
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Love this on the PC, been waiting for the mobile version for some time.  There are obviously more features on the PC version but that won't stop you from enjoying this.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's exactly what i expected having played the ipod and xbox version. it's fun, requires a little skill and some luck.<br />It didn't take long to download, and works fine on my epic. even if it wasn't free today, i would have bought it and been satisfied.<br /><br />I find the graphics are fine, but i don't expect blueray graphics on my phone.
0739381237|3.0|It was ok... the reader was a little boring for my students... they wanted voices... and for the reader to be more animated... thumbs down from my students...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was so shocked and surprised when I got the email this morning saying amazon was giving this away for free today. When I had seen screen shots of this game, I wasn't impressed. However, the gameplay is so addictive! Right up there with Angry Birds, this game is one of the, if not THE, best games for smart phones.
0316098329|5.0|As a clinical psychologist, this book on special meaning to me.  I marveled at the author's perceptiveness and attention to detail as she got inside of the mind of a five year old from whose point of view the book is written. Ma, the boy's mother, was kidnapped at the age of 19; she had Jack while imprisoned by the age of 21. Her life purpose was the protection of her child. She created a world for him such that he did not know that he was imprisoned. She taught him to read, to think creatively, and to experience as full a life as possible within the confines of an 11' x 11' room. This book is truly a story about the power of the human spirit; it illustrates once again that we cannot choose the hand we are dealt, but we can most certainly choose how to play it. [[ASIN:1456461087 Living Life from the  Inside Out: Who You Are Matters]] [...]
1401323820|5.0|First of all, yes the font is tiny. I guess many reader must have complained . that's why Naked Heat's mass market edition has a much bigger, more reasonable font.  The book is as fun as the show and I can almost see the show characters played out in front of me when I cam reading the book.  It has a lot of minor details that you can find from season1, like a certain line, support character.  But , if you are not a fan of the show, then don't bother. It's just another crime thriller. If you are a fan, then  you will fun with this book.
0152067043|5.0|arrived exactly as described, in perfect and new condition.  The book is well made and the board is nice and thick so our baby can't tear it when trying to eat it!    the book is a sweet story, very basic but fun for our 8 month old, I'm very happy we bought it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|74 Megabytes?  Are the developers INSANE?<br /><br />To put this in perspective, Angry Birds is 19 MB, Majesty is 14 MB, PewPew 2 is 14 MB, Zenonia 2 is 13 MB, and Fruit Ninja is 12 MB.  You could install ALL of these games in the same amount of space Plants vs. Zombies consumes, and still have room left over for Wordsmith (2 MB).<br /><br />This kind of wasteful programming should be discouraged.  There is absolutely no reason this app should be this bloated; it's just sloppy coding, plain and simple.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Motorola DEFY - Downloaded and installed, then I was disappointed when it crashed after the hourglass every time I tried to launch the game. Went into my app settings, cleared data for PVZ, then relaunched the game and it works now! Hurray! Hopefully I don't run into any more bugs or crashes.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is why Amazon kicks ass, by bringing awesome games to Android. At least helping to spread the word that there is a market for games on Android.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Well, I read this book. Obviously. I have to say, it is a good read. For the price, I must say, I think I got my money's worth of reading. Usually I'm optimistic about paying $14.99 for a book. This one kept me reading for a good while before I finished it.   The characters are likable-to an extent. You don't exactly love them, but you can relate to them. They aren't awesomely perfect, they have flaws just like the rest of us. Although, not all characters are explained as well as they could have been, such as Sarah and Emily. I felt like I hardly knew them, although they were a bit part of the book. That could just be me though...  The beginning takes about one chapter to hook you in. From there on, it makes you want to read more, see what happens next. Towards the end, it felt like I was dragging along, trying to get to the end. That disappointed me, somewhat, since the rest was fast-paced.   I really like the history aspect of this book as well. It explains how vampires live a long time, and if they do, they learn things about history. Thank GOD for not getting basic things wrong, or having an idiot girl saying \\"So what were the Romans?\\". Although this book goes beyond that, I very much enjoy that from the last couple of books I've read.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|I like this program much better than default Google calendar. It is much easier to enter new tasks and it is way easier to review existing tasks. Month view is especially nice and does the best job of making up for the lack of mouse hover that I have seen in a phone app. The screen widget works extremely well and gives a great overview of upcoming appointments. If you use Google calendar, you should really be using this app.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|does not work, plain and simple.  i see the hourglass,  then the app closes itself.  was a great game on ios, i just hope the developer works for a more polished application
0688014291|5.0|The great thing about Ken Blanchard's \\"One Minute Manager\\" is you can read it in about an hour (not a minute, as my co-worker joked). It's a tiny book that you can power through in no time, but the concepts in these limited pages are important and thought-provoking.<br /><br />\\"One Minute Manager\\" emphasizes the importance of asking the right questions, holding your staff to a high standard, holding them accountable (and yourself), and offering praise when it's appropriate. Like most leadership books, Blanchard's philosophy is pretty straightforward and touches on many of the same concepts other books espouse.<br /><br />You just can't beat the super fast read and the super easy to reference layout.<br /><br />A must-have for your leadership library.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Simon's \\"So beautiful or so what\\" is a great album. The melodies are beautiful and the sound is complex and yet very enjoyable. \\"Love and hard times\\" is gentle and delicate, \\"Getting ready\\" is addictive. If you're a Simon fan, You must have it...
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I was starting to get more and more camera gear and realized that my old camera bag just wasn't going to cut it.  I decided to buy this one because it was inexpensive, made by Amazon, and had good reviews.    Pros:  *It's large enough to fit a camera with a battery grip (kit lens installed), a flash, and three more lenses.  However, with all these items, it's really full (and pretty heavy too).  *It comes with several padded dividers that adhere with Velcro and let you partition the bag however you see fit.    *There are plenty of pockets and it comfortably stores everything I own.  *It's significantly cheaper than the Canon branded bag.    Cons:  *I've had this bag for about 6 months now, and normally when I carry it, I only use one shoulder strap.  I guess my bag is too heavy for this style of carrying because it's starting to fray where the bag strap attaches on top.  *There are quite a few extra straps (one to go across the top part of the chest, one to go around the abdomen) and personally I feel like they look kind of tacky and get in the way.    Summary:  It's a great little (or not so little) bag for the money, although having the strap fray after 6 months kind of worries me.  I'll probably have to buy another bag in the near future.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|now I own a copy for pc, xbox, ds, and my Android phone. its a game that can played time and time again !
B004UC1WN8|2.0|I've never bought her music before but I was excited after hearing On the Floor. The album on the whole was disappointing. I was hoping for more of a European dance flavor and that's definitely not what was delivered. Not sure I would take this risk again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game on my PC, and I'm soo glad to have it on my phone now too. Works great on my Samsung Epic!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Would have loved to play this game, but upon installing it, it says that it is not supported on Motorola Droid.
B00337KM2S|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars in my reviews; Up In The Air was so good I have no choice but to do that. George Clooney was terrific as Ryan Bingham, a cynical consultant who goes around the country firing people. A very shallow man, concepts like romantic love are alien to his character, whose main desire in life is to accumulate millions of travelers' miles. As the movie progresses, Ryan develops into a much more likable human being who realizes how empty his life truly is. When he reaches his miles goal, he realizes it's utterly insignificant.    Clooney's costars are terrific as well--Ryan's would-be girlfriend, Alex, is played well by Vera Fermiga. Alex is a frequent traveler who also avoids long-term commitments, so she and Ryan naturally become close.  Anna Kendrick plays Natalie, a  too smart for her own good college grad who is forced to travel with Ryan but doesn't understand or approve of his life choices.     Another great thing about Up In The Air is the non-formulaic ending. It doesn't end quite as neatly as many similiar movies. Clooney's character grows as a human being, but he falls short of his ultimate goal.     Buy it, rent it, whatever... this is a must see.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great game. but it seems the music is not working. I can hear the sound effects fine. Galaxy Tab 7in.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|some of the graphics are blurry, others are sharp. looks like they used images from the iPhone version which are low res, they will probably release an HD version for high resolution phones as a completely separate paid app. I'm glad I got this for free though, thanks Popcap
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I could go on and on about how much I like that show, but all I want to say is this bring it back. Find a way to bring it back and bring it back
B0052UZIFA|1.0|First app to refuse installation on the Motorola Xoom.  Fix that and I'll have a chance to review and score higher.  Xoom 3.1, Tiamat 1.4.3 kernel, 1.6ghz overclock.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Set!   Plant!  One of my favorite casual games is finally out for Android, so awesome. Keep up the awesome deals Amazon!

0316098329|4.0|Tired of reading the same old novels? If so, this will be a nice change of pace. Told from a very unique perspective, and written about a shocking topic, it is part mystery thriller and part relationship drama. I loved it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The game runs great, and I have no complaints.  I much prefer this version to the online flash version which has been around for years. Thanks Popcap and Amazon!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|What use is the apps store to me if the games dont work on my Droid ? UNINSTALL UNINSTALL UNINSTALL.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loved it on my ipod touch and now love it on my android. Really fun and addictive game with tons of levels.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. Very fun and addicting to play. Have been finished with the PC version on adventure mode for several months now. This Android version also jas the new achievement system in place. Works great on my Samsing galaxy s i500.
0425242099|5.0|Nalini Singh is one of my all time favorite authors.  There hasn't been a Psy/Changling book I didn't love.  I would be hard pressed to disclose my favorite of the series because each is unique and fantastic.  I have been anticipating this book for a long time.  In Lucas and Sasha's book I honestly wasn't sure if Sienna and Hawke would ever get a book because Hawke was so hard put about his mate when they were kids, I mean really little kids.  As the stories progressed I kept my fingers crossed that theirs would be written.  It seems fitting (though unfair to my wallet and paperback collection) that their story would be the first in Hard Cover, it's easily one of the most anticipated.<br /><br />I re-read all of the books this weekend in order and finally came to Kiss of Snow.  I have learned over the years that to have any form of high, exciting, exhilarating, it'll be A+++ and everything I ever hoped expectations will leave me with nothing but disappointment, so I read it in order, with an open mind.  I adored it.  The buildup between Sienna and Hawke was definitely time consuming, it was at times irritating and I wanted to either strangle Hawke or smack Sienna upside the head... Bars?? But then again she is 19 and acting out the way her instincts are telling her to in order to get attention from Hawke.  The payoff is there though when they come together.  Which highlights one of my favorite points about all of Singh's books.... I have never felt like they were smut or had to roll my eyes during her bedroom scenes.  They have all been well written and beautiful.  Hawke and Sienna's was a bit more combustible, but do you blame them or her? They have been dancing around the issue of themselves for years.<br /><br />Like all of her books there is more than one plot line and more going on below the surface to hint at future books and upcoming trials.  Which is another reason she is a fantastic author, her world is big and well put together.  We see old couples as well as new ones getting together.  I am not sure who the ghost is, but frankly I really want him to have his own book, though I'm not sure what heroine would be perfect for him...  Anyway this isn't the be all end all of books, and certainly it wasn't perfect there were parts that I wish were different (Kit being just one), but reading it, I had a good content feeling at the end, I was happy they finally got their heads screwed on straight and I'm really looking forward to the next installment.  I can't say don't go in without expectations because we all have them, all I can say is that I sincerely loved it and couldn't put it down.  Enjoy!tting together.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game works just fine on my evo and my girlfriend's optimus s, so if your phone can't handle it don't downrate the game when  the problem it's likely your phone. Maybe it's time to upgrade.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Says that there is a package error.  Can't install. I have played it on other people phones, and it's a very good game. I just wish it was on my phone.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|I was a bit disappointed that it doesn't include the Challenge, Mini-game, and Garden modes from the PC version. Still, it's a very fun and well-made game, especially for mobile. It looks great and runs well on my Optimus T, though it does slow down a bit when there are a lot of zombies and plants on the screen, but it's still very playable.

1589795474|3.0|I went to Barnes and Nobles and purchased this for ~$17. Here it is on sale for $10! (If you really want this book for a good price, you should buy it here. Amazon gives a good deal.)<br /><br />After 3 days, I have finished reading this. The first few chapters were interesting.  It made me want to dig deeper.  However, I found the material a little repetitive and dense after the initial hook. The authors definitely put a lot of work into gathering facts, but there are some dry parts which sort of drag out the story. This book has a LOT of figures and tables. Some of which are hard to interpret without detailed explanation. There are numerous references to different case studies and surveys, which have been done on the millionaire's next door. It's nice the authors have data to back their conclusions, but at times it could be overkill because of how much they repeated themselves.  This book may be more geared towards those who want an academic read.<br /><br />A lot of the chapters just re-iteriate the main idea. This book gives various examples to support their theory, but the examples seem to be very similar and largely survey based. The main idea is basically that if you'd like to accumulate wealth you should focus on conserving wealth. It is not simply enough to make good income. According to their definition, if you don't retain the income, you are not really 'wealthy' by their definition. You could make 6 figures but if you don't keep it you don't count. The authors provide their own definition of wealthy as having retained accumulated wealth over $1 million in the bank at some point in your life.  I have minor objections to this, which I won't go into because they are not that important.<br /><br />However, one major issue I did have with the philosophy of the book is that it places an overly high emphasis on saving money and being frugal. I agree, frugality is a virtue--to an extent. (If you disagree I suggest you look up the Witch of Wallstreet). My issue is the assertion that the authors make about people who are hyper-consumers. (Hyper-consumers have their virtue, too!  They help drive the economy by keeping the money fluid and flowing.) More importantly, they are not all shallow status symbol seeking, greedy, thoughtless, selfish b*****ds that this book depicts them as.<br /><br />I think there is a category of consumer that doesn't just spend money to \\"display status symbols\\" or make a peacock show. Some people spend money to go on vacations and eat at fancy restaurants because the experience is worth the money they pay for this. Price is relative. The market will only charge what there is demand for. Some people value experiences, including financially costly ones when they are young, more than having a massive bank account at the end of their life.  They want to LIVE life in the moment, too! The most important thing I think is to be happy. That is true 'wealth'.<br /><br />Personally, I don't want to have millions in the bank if it means I must suffer and scrimp to every dime and nickel to get there--literally scraping by. Some of these millionaires retain money until they are on their wooden death bed forgo-ing evil cushioning 'luxury'.  I mean, several times in this book, the authors suggest that what the real wealthy worry about is estate tax. They have such massive money accumulated they have to find inventive ways to shield it from the government, such as by hiring estate lawyers and expert accountants. They have to give it all way ($10,000 per relative per year) to avoid tax. This is not something I want to save my money for.  If anything, it would make me want to be a little more like the UAW (underaverage wealthy) who at least get to experience the benefits of the fruits of their labor. Some people want to enjoy life. Often times to enjoy life, you do have to put some money forward. Not everything is free.<br /><br />Of course, I'm using this as an example. I think it's best to have a balance of these two extremes than to try to lean to one extreme (super saver) or another (wasteful spender). It's better to save for the future but also reserve the right to enjoy some for the present- because you never know what tomorrow will bring. I think book needs a little more balance in its point of view.<br />Otherwise, I think this book does a good job of illustrating that there is a difference in the behaviors of those who are able to conserve wealth verses those who eat it. Many rabid consumers would benefit from taking a page out of this.  (Just make sure to have enough money to both enjoy life AND save enough to retire off of!)extreme (super saver) or another (wasteful spender).

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I initially loaded it before i left for work and tested it later the app ran but the aspect ratio was a total wash closed the app and reopened and continued to force close. I uninstalled the application then reinstalled it and worked fine after that. im running a G2 with CM7 and no issues here all sound effects and levels work great so far.
0316056863|5.0|I really enjoyed Tina Fey's book. As a big fan of 30 rock and SNL, I thought she translated that same sense of humour in her writing style. Which shouldn't be a surprise as a comedy writer. My only hope is that she will continue to write. Since her chapters span a lifetime of stories and experiences not mention other types of writing genres, it seems like this book may have been a one-shot or that she was just testing the waters of book sales. Since this book was largely successful my hope is that she continues to write and reveals even more of experiences in her witty humour for us to read. I was sad when I hit the last chapter and sincerely hope there will be more to come.
B00479SVBU|4.0|With adequate storage, you will not have to listen to the same music for days, even if traveling long hours.  Quick set up is limited by getting your music onto whatever storage desired.  The readout is simple.  File search is simple but don't search while driving.  Fidelity is good.  Actual physical space is amazingly small.  Great device to use for short or long trips.  Multiformat and connectibility was better than most of the devices I considered.  Once the station is set and tuned the device just goes on and on.  I now have two of these players.
1440503257|5.0|Bought for a friend! Has lots of recipes which is cool but you can find recipes online as well. Too small in size. Looks grand in picture in my opinion.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love plants vs Zombies!. Great to find out that it works on my non rooted Droid X 2.3. Only gripe i have is the shapes look squished at the top and bottom. Other then that its my Plants vs zombies on the go. Thanks Popcap!
0553386794|4.0|Being a person who rarely reads fantasy, I was a little uneasy about reading this book, especially when I looked at the character log in the back, with all the houses listed and its history. Oh shoot, I said, I won't be able to keep everyone straight.<br /><br />But I couldn't believe how entertaining it was. The plot is fresh and exciting, with interesting twists and turns nearly every step of the way. I must say that there was only two or three characters I was absolutely in love with, one of them being Princess Dany. I took off half a star in rating because I did not see enough of her in the book that I would have liked. Also, I found it hard to believe that the author killed off the characters that he did. NOTE: There is no happy ending to the first of this series.<br /><br />The writer is very talented and he is definitely one that will forever be remembered. If you like historical fiction, especially with a medieval setting, then you will like this, despite it being of a fantasy genre. Can't wait to continue the series.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|My Original Droidi is only 1 1/2 years old and PopCap is saying it's \\"TOO OLD\\" because their developers write poor code and are too lazy to make it work.    It's not just that it doesn't work on the original Droid. It's customer satisfaction. How am I supposed to even consider buying a PopCap game in the future when you aren't supporting me right now? Chuzzle was available a few weeks ago for free as well. Downloaded and installed on my Droid, then nothing. It never worked and even worse, I couldn't uninstall. Thankfully I had a nandroid image from that morning so I could restore. So Far PopCap is 0-2 on Android for me. Such a shame as they have great desktop games.     Oh and for all you folks who just got their Incredibles/thunderbolts, etc. This is standing up for you as well because in less than one year you will be in the same situation Original Droid owners are in now. Your phone will be 1 -2 years old and no longer supported. So rather than call us whiners, you should be vocalizing that you don't want the same thing to happen to your device. When does it stop, if popcap can get it away with it now, who's next? And what phone won't be supported next?
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't work on my Fascinate. Hourglass and then black, that's all it does. uninstalled and reinstalled. No difference. Redownloaded and reinstalled. No difference.<br /><br />Also, wtf with Droid incompatibility? My wife is super disappointed. It probably wouldn't have worked anyway...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm glad this was finally released on Android.  It works flawlessly on the EVO 4G.  Here's to hoping Popcap continues to release more games, including Insaniquarium!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This version is so slow even on a Tegra2. It's an embarrassment for Popcap.  Atleast it was free. i have the same game on iphone and that one kicks ass.
B00005MM67|4.0|I think this is a great movie and have no idea why it is so hard to find.  I guess maybe it didn't do too well at the box office or something.  They obviously aren't going to make a wide-screen version of this movie either which takes a lot away from the awesome scenery.  I started watching it by accident on one of the movie channels and couldn't stop! I had a very hard time finding this on DVD for some reason.  If you like documentaries about climbing Everest and stuff, it's fun to watch Hollywood's twist on it.  And it is a big twist.  But fun to watch.  Hopefully the 4 x 3 screen size won't bother you.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|runs awesome on evo, moved to SD card and it has less then 1mb if my phones memory. classic mobile game!
0736083863|5.0|Pilates has splintered into many \\"schools or approaches,\\" much like yoga, leaving some of us confused as to which version is closest to the original. This book is as close to the original as is possible, so you can relax in the knowledge that reading it will give you an in-depth understanding of the original intent. That understanding will serve you well regardless which variation of the technique you later wish to pursue or, if you are already immersed in a variation, you will gain a deeper understanding of how your program may vary and why.    It's no surprise that this is a beautifully illustrated and well-written guide to how Pilates affects our musculature considering that one of the authors, Rael Isacowitz, has studied for three decades with the first-generation of students who had been directly taught by Joseph and Claire Pilates. Furthermore, this text has been based on one of two books written by Joseph Pilates himself, Return to Life Through Contrology.    This direct-lineage is important if you value authenticity. Pilates is wildly popular because it works. Getting information from the source is crucial to understanding how and why it works and making it work more effectively. Students of Reiki know that their teachers will authenticate how many \\"removes\\" they are from the originator of the techniques. Knowing you are getting information and counsel from someone who is only \\"two removes\\" from Pilates himself is important in the same way.    The other author, Karen Clippinger, brings over three decades of experience in teaching anatomy, devoting more than half of that time to bringing Pilates into academic and rehabilitation centers. That these two incredibly experienced and talented people would come together to develop this book is a blessing to teachers and students of Pilates because it does not exclude any varying interpretation of Pilates; it provides a foundation for and an enhancement of each.    If you don't include an understanding of anatomy inyour teaching or practice of Pilates, you undermine its effectiveness. With a solid appreciation of how each movement utilizes and affects specific muscle groups, you can maximize your practice and minimize injuries. This book allows you to see those groups and that helps you visualize your movements in a way that mere words cannot achieve.    What I found particularly useful was understanding the six key principles: breathing, concentrating, centering, controlling, being precise, and flowing from one movement into another. After all, Pilates called his system contrology so knowing how to control or make the connection between your mind and body is essential.    Be sure to read the discussion on the Science of Breathing because, unless you breath properly, you are essentially wasting your time in any exercise. You need to oxygenate your muscles to allow them to perform well, and proper breathing will make you feel as healthier and exercise more effectively. Students of yoga and meditation already know how important disciplined breath is and will appreciate the emphasis and explanations in this book.    As I age, I find it increasing difficult to maintain a youthful posture. I slump and sag with stress and fatigue and long for more upright posture and smoother, more graceful carriage. Iscaowitz and Clippinger cannot guarantee that I get back to that state, but their discussion of what proper alignment of the spine and the function of core muscles surely puts me firmly on the path back to a healthier and happier state of being.    Make no mistake, this is a book for mat work. I own a Pilates machine, but this book is going to have me back on the floor as well. You will see exactly how you should place and align your body. They tell you how to execute each movement, which muscles are directly affected and which muscles offer secondary support to the movement. There are lists of clues to making each movement more effective as well as suggestions for modifications and variations. I enjoyed the Exercise Notes in particular because the notes provide the context and purpose of each movement which helps someone like me who follows instruction much better if I know the rationale behind them. The authors not only discuss what to do, how to do it, but why doing it is important.    I also liked the section on how to customize your own Pilates program and the Exercise Finder at the end of the book. The Exercise Finder helps you understand which of the modern movements were not in the original text of Joseph Pilates in case that is important to you.    This book complements everything I've learned as a Reiki Master and as beginning student of yoga because its emphasis is on understanding and respecting your body, breath, and the mind-body connection. I consider this an important addition to my library and am grateful I was granted a chance to review it through the Library Thing's Early Reviewer program.    Human Kinetics, the publisher, has once again gathered an impressive graphic arts team and the illustrations of Molly Borman clarify and communicate the information necessary to understand how the movements involve and impact the body. From the early general discussions of breathing and skeletal structures to the specific movements, the illustrations make the instructions and cautions come alive. If there are specific parts of your body where you want to effect change these illustrations will help you visualize the process and results. That alone makes the book worth more than its modest price. Being able to know how what you are doing is actually working makes this book invaluable
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Played the first 2 boards. Did not seem very exciting to me. What's the point? Does it get any better?
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This is an excellent game on PC but even better on my Android phone (Samsung Vibrant). It's a better platform for this kind of game and even more fun to play with a touch screen interface. It took a few minutes to download and install but loads quickly and runs smoothly. The graphics are bright, colorful and have that undeniable Popcap charm. I haven't finished it yet but so far it looks identical to it's PC counterpart. My only nitpick complaint is when sprites are scaled larger they look a tiny bit pixelated, but maybe it's due to my phone's screen size or resolution and people with other phones won't notice it. That being said, the graphics are far from awful (at least on my phone, can't speak to the quality on tablet devices) and the game is still as addictive and enjoyable as ever. I haven't been too impressed with the Android game line-up since I bought my phone, but the availability of this game is an encouraging sign. Hopefully we will see more games of this caliber in the future!
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I've had my eye on this knife for more than a year now and noticed a drop in price... and then another drop, $33.50 with free shipping and it was just a reflex at that point. After I bought it I watched it go down to $29 here on Amazon... THIS IS CRAZY!!! Getting 1/4\\" thick, 1095 steel blade at this price is absolutely SICK! If you're looking for a Tough, Beefy, Heavy Workhorse of a knife... Look no further. An Incredible buy at this price! I'm not a prophet but I predict this knife will be one of the most popular survival knives in a year or so. I bet they will fly off the shelf once everyone catches on and gets over the overseas production thing.<br /><br />After I opened the box and pulled the plastic off I was in love. My next observation was that it seemed smaller in person than it did on the video reviews I've been watching - it just has a larger look on screen than in real life. This is a meaningless observation but thought I'd share it. The next thing I took note of was the removable handle. Most all of the Amazon reviews and video reviews lead me to believe the handle was a soft rubber... it is not soft rubber or at least mine isn't. It is a hard, kraton material that seems to be very durable and is quite comfortable. It's not perfectly flush with the tang but I feel no discomfort and have no concerns with this. It's a large handle and provides several different grips. You can choke up by placing your index finger on the choil which provides excellent control for close up work. My hands are small and can grip it behind the index finger groove for better chopping leverage. The contoured shape fills the hand and the flared end keeps it there. The raised circle pattern provides excellent grip and looks pretty cool.<br /><br />This knife is so thick and heavy for its length it feels like a club in the hand and makes you think it's indestructible. Makes that other \\"Ultimate\\" Knife look like a toy. After ogling for a while I inspected it more closely and found it to be very well made. The steel is finely and evenly shaped. The edge is precise and sharpened right down to the choil. The flat grind is only slightly beveled to form the edge giving it better cutting power than some of the more deeply beveled blades that are out there. The dark gray blade coating is tough and very handsome. It prevents corrosion, glare and reflection. The modest thumb ramp has large knobby jimping and works well but not so outrageous that it interferes with batoning or other camp/survival tasks. If you have to choose one knife this one can do it all!<br /><br />The nylon sheath is fine. It holds the knife securely with plastic insert and the handle retention strap length is adjustable thanks to velcro... it still secures with a snap. It has a removable front pouch that can attach to your belt separately. There is a velcro strap and snap on the back of the sheath that can be used on a molle system. Velcro belt loop allows removal of sheath without having to take your belt off. There are lots of ways to modify and upgrade this sheath with a little bit of planning. I added an extra retention strap by burning 2 holes through the belt loop with a torched nail and adding paracord with a spring loaded cord lock. Quick, run... buy this knife!!<br /><br />Update July 2012:<br /><br />Still lovin' this knife. It retains its edge and the blade coating holds up well. I chopped a 6\\" fallen tree in half very quickly and batoned many a big log into smaller logs for the camp fire. I have no complaints with this knife and highly recommend it!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is so fun &amp; addicting! im so glad it's finally on android! and love that amazon is offering it for free today! yay!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting for this gime forever to come to android and it is finally here and I have to say they did a great job and it runs perfect on my drod x.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Okay I have a Droid x and this game runs flawless. The only pixelation I see is at the end of the round when you unlock a new plant. The graphics are great and look amazing on the phone. I don't know what everyone is complaining about. Either go buy a decent phone or stop complaining. Great came 5 stars.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm so happy I got an android tablet,and the Amazon app store just makes everything better. well the game runs smoothly and looks great. sometimes it'll take long to load but besides that this is like the best game since angrybirds
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very fun time killer. It is large tho. It takes around 75 megs of space on your phone. But, move it to your sd card and it now takes around 250 kb. Thanks Amazon for this nice little present!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Would buy again. This is PopCap's masterpiece, one of the greatest games of all time. Tower defense perfected. If you only ever get one app, get this one.
B003Y5H556|3.0|RED RIDING HOOD is a re-imagining of the classic fairytale. The problem is that they've turned it into a soft-core teen romance, and since I haven't been a teen for 2 or 3 decades, I found the love scenes disturbing. Can you say, \\"Peeping Tom?\\" I knew that you could!<br /><br />So be aware that RED RIDING HOOD is a period teen romance with supernatural creatures, none of whom sparkle. Beyond that, it's mildly entertaining with okay performances by Gary Oldman and Julie Christie. They're only okay, which is a shame, but the movie isn't about them. Neither is it about Lukas Haas (didn't he die of an overdose of Pop-Rocks in Vietnam?) who has an odd part to play. All of the acting is serviceable but there's nothing exciting about it. Again, it's all about the teens and even though they're pretty, they're nothing to write home about.<br /><br />Oh, I forgot to mention the plot of RED RIDING HOOD. Here goes: A teeny-weenie medieval village is terrorized by a werewolf. Gary Oldman is a sort of Grand Inquisitor cum Van Helsing who arrives to save the day. Madcap mayhem (and teen love) ensue.<br /><br />I gave RED RIDING HOOD a 3 because I recognize that I am not the target demographic. If you're a veteran of more than 25 summers, you might want to steer clear of this one. Peeping Toms, on the other hand...
1575666286|5.0|Excellent book detailing the procedures needed to cure numerous diseases (including cancer). Even if you're currently healthy you could learn a lot about staying that way from the information provided in the book... I also recommend Charlotte's book, \\"Healing the Gerson Way.\\"
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Yeah, what's the difference? Seems if it works on the 3G it should work on the Slide. The addition of a slide out keyboard shouldn't make that much of a difference to the parts of the phone the game needs I would think.
1591843790|5.0|Guy always has great insights to the technology - this time he gives us his invaluable insights on how to build a great company.  A must read!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|There's no question you want this game.  Nope, there is none.  It's a great game, it's amusing, addictive, pays off well and has incredible replay value.  I started on the PC with this, went to a less-than-stellar version on the Ipod Touch, and finally have it running on an Evo 4g.    There are a few things here - why is it Wifi only?  I bought this whole 4g thing so that I could, oh, I don't know, download a large game without being stuck to Wifi... this, however, is a beef most likely with Amazon.    The game has problems on my system.  Gameplay is fine, however when it goes to fade out to transition to a notification screen it's like it goes into slow-motion.  It's also a pain getting phone calls while playing this as after you hang up you can expect the phone to be unresponsive for a while.  Not sure how much of that is android programming and how much is just that the game is freaking large.    Anyway, the game is amazingly fun.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|one of the best games ever...great graphics and replay value!!! game does not lag at all and looks stellar~ Samsung infuse 4g
B0052UZIFA|1.0|After a few tweeks i was able to download this in the UK.  It says you need 73.9MB to download. Fair enough i have just over 100MB free.  Yet when i went to download it, it says i dont have enough memory!  So that means it takes up over 100MB of memory? I cant even move to SD if it doesnt install at all! Rediculous.
B001MYIXAC|4.0|This is certainly not your average vampire movie.  It has no swooning teens and it is all the better for that.  If you want an intelligent thriller that delivers its shocks without resorting to schlock, you could do a lot worse.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have to say I was quite disappointed that this doesn't work on the droid.  With as many droids are there are out there you think that would be pretty obvious but I guess not.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is the best game ever! i cant believe its now available for android! thank you Amazon for giving it to us for free!!! very addicting! Amazon app store is my favorite place to get apps offically. -droid x 2.2.1
B0052UZIFA|4.0|i already have this on my laptop and my Ipad. now I can have it on my phone too. it lags a little when youve got lots of weapons shooting and heads rolling... and it fc once on my htc inspire 4g. but thats all minor to me. im just happy i can play on my phone too now
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Works without any issues on my Droid X. Greay game, very good graphics. Glad it is finally available for android!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played on Android and that's saying a lot considering that there aren't many. Very colorful and smooth graphics. The music is also charming and accents the gameplay very well. However, it is the gameplay that will keep you hooked. Beating endless waves of zombies with plants has never been more fun. Hopefully, the dev adds more levels, modes and designs as the game goes on. 5 out 5.  T-Mobile G2.
031603438X|2.0|I've read far better rock 'n' roll biographies, such as Slash or Scar Tissue or The Dirt.  This one is just not very engaging, which is really surprising given that this is Keith Richards.  I had a really hard time finishing it. I think an editor was needed to cut it down in half.
B004B32532|5.0|I thought I was jaded with any horror or thriller.  I like to figure movies out and lately there isn't much in the movies today that hold me until the end.  I had a pleasant surprise when I picked this movie off of Netflix.  I don't usually buy movies but I just had to get this one on blue ray. It pulled me in and gave me empathy for the lead and left me sad at the end as well.  It also brought memories of my days of going to the circus and feeling a little creeped out by clowns but in some weird way comforted at the same time.  With out going over the story I just will say, I think it is a beautiful horror movie that brings out the potential monsters that may be lurking inside of us all.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The app runs great on my Nexus One running CyanogenMod 7. A bit of lag when getting a new plant, though that may just be how the graphics should look. Haven't played PvZ before.
1416596585|3.0|If you want a good history of Google's early years, this is the book for you.  The author, a Google booster, had unparalleled access to current and former Google employees and presents more information about the history and development of the company than has reached print before.  If you're interested in the causes of Google's recent stumbles, though, the author's hagiographic approach  gets in the way of understanding.  Here are a half dozen \\"evil\\" approaches from the \\"don't be evil\\" company that simply are not adequately explained.  (1) Google went into the China market and self-censored itself based on what it understood the Chinese autocrats wanted it to do.  It didn't get out of China until the Chinese government launched a sophisticated  hack that not only broke into and stole Google's top secret code, it stole the gmail contact lists of Chinese dissidents.  Why didn't Google recognize the slippery slope of the rationalizations that allowed it to participate in this charade, especially co-founder Sergey Brin, who had escaped from a similar regime?  (2) Google was initially in favor of the positive public good of \\"net neutrality\\" when  it was trying to break into the field, but suddenly it's no longer in favor of such neutrality for wireless. Why the about-face?  (3) In its book scan project Google initially took the legal position that what it was doing was fair use, and the author makes clear that the legal community thought it would win on this point.  (p. 362).  Yet ultimately Google bought into a suggestion from the Writers Guild of America that Google should become the designated internet bookstore for copyrighted books that are out of print and that it should create a registry to determine who should be paid for the books.  Not coincidentally, Google would have profited handsomely by this arrangement. The only explanation the author proffers is that \\"it was a foregone conclusion that [co-founder] Larry Page would sign on....  It was his personal historyand that of Google that determined that he embrace the scheme.\\"  (p. 362). This tautology is no explanation, and of course a federal judge has now rejected the settlement, a fact that occurred too late to get into this volume.  (4) On the Wi-Fi-street view project, again the author has no explanation as to why Google cars roaming the street sucked up all unprotected communications to and from the internet, other than \\"the engineers working on the Wi-Fi street view project noticed that someone had written useful code and implemented it.\\" (p. 343). What?  (5) Google implemented a social networking application based on gmail that automatically gave everyone access to your entire email contacts list, and showed the frequency with which you communicated with each contact (\\"Buzz\\").  The $8 million privacy settlement that Google entered into a few months ago didn't make its way into this book.  How could the \\"don't be evil\\" company be so tone deaf on privacy?  Again, the author doesn't offer any clues.  (6) The most problematic issue has resulted from Google's purchase of internet ad king Double Click.  After the purchase, without letting any of us know, it substituted its former privacy-conserving policy of keeping track of our web browsing only when we clicked through to one of Google's advertisers, to a new policy of keeping track of us every time we visit a web page that either has a connection to Doubleclick or contains Google ads, whether or not we click on the ad.  All Google has to do to keep track of ALL of our individual web browsing is to match this up with the search data that it keeps for each of us for 9 months.  What guarantee do we have that Google won't do that in the search for the type of profits it was looking for in China, in the book search project, and everywhere else?  The author just doesn't say.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|On the Droidx Plants vs Zombies looks and plays great. I know that on the download page it states that it would only work on certain droidx's but on a rooted droidx running Apex 1.4 there seems to be no issue.  On the Xoom it seems to be less polished and I was expecting a little bit more. Perhaps in the future there will be an optimized hd release, but at the moment it seems to be a bit laggy for some reason.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|this app ported over pretty well. game play is smooth, touch is responsive. game has tje feel of tje original with one issue... it looks like crap. I dont know if they dumbed the detail down, but it sure looks like it. must be related to tje multiple devices it must support. I would rather given tje choice play this on my iTouch where tje detail is sharp and colorful, not drab and grainy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game was fabulous on my Mac and it translates beautifully on my EVO. Great game. You should download this NOW! You'll be addicted for hours, days, months, or even until the zombie apocalypse! Don't worry, you'll be prepared to defend yourself! :)

You are suppose to eat the same thing every day except for 1 day a week on which you can eat anything. Not gonna try it cause I know, for me, the weight can't be kept OFF with this kind of diet.   Wish I had known all this before I bought the book. Hope this helps.

While the book won't teach you quick tricks or shortcuts like the Princeton Review or Manhattan GMAT, it will give you everything you need to adequately prepare.    Happy Studying and Best of Luck!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|great app graphics are sick been waiting for this one for some time now can't believe is free woot woot woot
0525457585|5.0|This book for its kind is one of the best I've read! I never thought I would see so much beauty in imaginary places as in Tolkien's or Pullman's books! It is not so much a children's book. A child could never appreciate so much the complexity of the different worlds! But even so, I don't think there ever was a child who has read it and didn't like it! This edition is really wonderful! I really enjoyed that the story is written in two colors and all the drawings in the beginning of each chapter are from the same colors!
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Great flick!  They finally bring back the kind of Batman from Mask of the Phantasm and Subzero after so many years!  No more kid stuff!  Everything makes sense down to Earth.  Great casts and story.  They have Bender Bending Rodriguez as the Joker!  This is so wonderful!    Must see!  5 stars!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|wonderful app, very good to keep me occupied! i love the appstore and the free app of the day, saved me a good bit of money :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|HTC EVO, no issues, stores to card, lag is normal loading and no worse than Angry Birds or any other larger game.  if you like puzzle games, you need this game!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The game freezes then crashes at the hourglass loading screen on my samsung captivate, with Paragon ROM. May just be a ROM issue, but still annoying.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this, it seems like, FOREVER!  Playing it on an EVO 4g and it runs smoothly and hasn't glitched or lagged out yet!  SO HAPPY!
B000JK8OYU|5.0|This album is amazing, enough said. Furthermore, if you have ever been curious about what all the buzz is about with this band, but don't know what album to start with to really get the feel of what their best is, get this one. This mixes tons of sound clips from many of the Beatles' superb songs into an incredible medley you will enjoy from start to (unfortunate) finish.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|this game plays awesome and is really fun but it's disappointing to see that it looks pretty bad on a qHd display.. hopefully support for higher resolution phones and tablets come soon!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It took a moment for it to download.. But works wonderful for me.. No lag.. no freezing.. and it's super fast.. I'm super pleased with Amazon App store!! and I <3 PVZ.. Thank you for bringing my phone a game worth all of its battery life!! I can't put this one down!!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great game on HTC Evo... no issues with speed... graphic not all that but hey its still an awesome game
B004GGM444|5.0|I didn't know much about Dubstep before I heard Skrillex (now I'm even more confused ;-) [and a huge fan] - This guy is completely AMAZING! If you're into Rap - Rock - Metal - House - Trance and more, there's a bit of it all on here.  I've been musically stagnant for a while (though always a fan of \\"electronic\\" music) - this woke me back up. I'm not feeding you a line either, this has completely changed the way I look at music (again). Watch out for this guy - I think he's about to explode!  He's also on Deadmau5's label (which I didn't know at first) - but it sure explained a lot when I found out...    Tip: Make sure you have a good sound system or good headphones with great frequency response before listening - this isn't your average \\"play on any system\\" kind of music, this is something new [to me anyhow] (and a taste of things to come...) - I need to find more like it!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A lot of today's young adult literature is really banal.  I picked this up because it is set in a post-apocalyptic world (a genre I have recently gotten into).  I figured that it would be one of those books I read a bit at a time just to get through the story, and would probably never pick up again.  I was completely wrong, and I cannot wait to get the second book in the series!  The world they live in is called Panem (used to be North America) and the country is divided into 12 districts.  Several years prior to the book the people of Panem rebelled against the Capitol and lost.  As punishment, the Capitol forces the 12 districts to sacrifice two of their children every year (one boy, one girl) in a televised fight to the death.  In Panem ,you begin to enter your name into a lottery when you first turn 12 and continue until you are 18, and every year you name is entered more (for example, when you are 12 you enter your name once, and then at 13 you enter it twice, and so on). You are reimbursed with food, and if you chose to, you can enter you name for each family member for more food (you are 12 enter your name once, and then you enter your name for five members of your family so you really are entered 6 times that first year).  So this twisted lottery is held annually and to add to the sickness of the ordeal, the people of Panem are supposed to treat this like a celebration (like the Olympics but with death).  The whole point of the Hunger Games is for the Capitol to show their complete control over Panem.      It is in this world the Katniss Everdeen lives in, and participates in the Hunger Games.  She is from District 12 (which is when Appalachia used to be), and volunteers to compete when her little sister's name is called.  The book is very hard to put down.  Katniss  is plainly disgusted in everything about the game, however its either play or die.  The book is a little dry the first two or three chapters, but it is hard to put down after you get the part where they prep for the game.  If you are looking for a good series to read this summer, look no farther then this book.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is a great game finally for android. if you like strategy this is a fun game for that. it runs great and smooth on the htc incredible.
0375703764|5.0|I got this book for my daughter as a gift, She loves his work. I may not dive into his work, but as she would finish a chapter she would tell me all about it. She wishes they would make a movie of it. It is a crazy book, but if you are up for a challenge dive in, you will enjoy every minute of it.
B003XWEQ1G|3.0|This movie could of been something great, but it seems like there was no inspiration to make it an awesome remake.
0393327655|3.0|More like 2.5 stars, I gave up about 2/3rds the way through it. I got it from this list of the \\"Ten Best\\" It started off fairly well, then he went into this 50 page anti-Muslim tirrade while only mentioning Judaism in passing,  and the Old Testament but only from a fundamentalist Christian view the bible. Barely, and I mean like half a line, a word about how Israel treats the Palestinians or their world view in general.    It would have been better if he'd stuck to generalities about how religion affects us all rather than picking on one sect and leaving out the rest.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Excellent port of the popular iPhone game. This game is fun, simple to pick up, addictive and challenging with an almost limitless replay value.<br /><br />My only problem is that this game is compatible with my phone (Nexus One), but doesn't work on my girlfriend's phone (Motorola Droid).
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Crappy developers can't be bothered to make this work on legacy devices or new devices. I would love to play this game. I would buy this game, but alas I only have an OG Droid. Just lazy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my HTC inspire 4g (aka desire hd).  So far no problems downloading it and loading it up on the device and transfered it to my SD card.  I like the game over all.  Basically its a tower defense game that has a smart economics system in place that plays out really really well.  Stop the zombies from reaching your house.   A good defense is important and it required me to be very strategic in how i place my plants and where to place them on the grass.  Also using different type of plants was important as well. Its my new addiction.  And a must download for anyone who has a compatible android device.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD is not meant for those who are overweight or obese or very large busted women. Where would one fine a sport bra for a 42 L bra size or at the least a 42DDDD? This DVD is not realistic.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was addicted to the computer version and this is nearly exactly the same! Touch screen controls are easy and accurate so far.  Smooth animations and fast loading on my Thunderbolt. Definitely lots of fun.  Large file so just make sure you move it to Sd card.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i have been waiting for this game to come to the android market, have played on my pc and am addicted. works great, no issues as of yet and have been playing it since i downloaded it a little bit ago...samsung fascinate.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|When I first installed and tried to open it just went to an hourglass and then crashed to my home page. I cleared data and that fixed that. Now on lvl 1-8 when you have to select your plants, I can't select play after picking my plants. Droid 2
B000O1799U|1.0|At about the 90 minute mark, I felt that my nightmare was just about over. I then remembered that there was about 40 minutes left to this string of cliches. I plan to start a 12-step recovery group for myself and others who have been traumatized by this travesty. What was so bad about it? Only the writing/acting/music/period-detail/directing...everything else was pretty good.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|works wonders on droid x froyo. looks good runs almost perfect. ive been waiting for pvz and here it is!
6302212529|5.0|Great Job. The movie came in wonderful condition and FAST! I wasnt even expecting it until 2 days later. Thank you.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come to android for a while and so happy it's finally here. Works great on the htc EVO.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|bit of slowdown win you get a new item and a bit fuzzy but runs fine unlike chuzzle. worth the 3 bucks!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've heard a lot of hype over this game and after reading a review on Androidpolice. com figured I would try it or. All I can say is that it's really fun and incredibly entertaining. I didn't really think it could possibly occupy hours of my time like Angry Birds but it has. Htc Evo
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting forever for this to come to my Android device. Well worth the wait and just like the original iPhone version. no lagging. no problems. runs smooth on my customized Droid Incredible.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have a Motorola Android and it wouldn't download at all. My kids are so disappointed! This isn't really for Motorola Androids.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The only reason I gave it One star is because I had to...I am super bummed because I LOVE this game but I can't download it because it says my phone is incompatible (LG Ally) but it's clearly on the list...major suckage!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I was quite excited about the launch of this game, and when I noticed that Amazon finally had it today, I immediately downloaded it. However, within a matter of seconds of launching the game, I was quite disappointed.    I have an HTC EVO. So far, the only good thing I can say about the game is that it can be played.  Below are the issues and places for improvement that I have thus far:  1) Graphics: What happened PopCap? Even the logo on the very first screen doesn't look completely clear. During gameplay, I was simply stunned by the poor resolution of most of the sprites used. What happened here?!?! Is there no HDPI support?!?!  2) Sound: If there is literally anything at all that runs in the background, even if it's as simple as receiving a text message, the sounds become messed up, and only one sound starts playing at a time (for example, if a pea hits a zombie, that sound is played and the background music is completely muted). Furthermore, even if there is nothing going on in the background, there are some instances when the zombie starting to move causes the sound to lag.  3) Gameplay: Why are there so few modes? Maybe I was expecting too much, but I was definitely hoping for at least some of the mini-games to be present.  4) Performance: Same issue as the sound issue, except in terms of detecting touch activities. I was messing with my friend's LG Optimus S and my other friend's Samsung Galaxy S, and it seems that their phones have even greater problems rendering everything while accepting input from the user, so it is definitely not just an isolated issue. It feels almost as if the threads in the app are not being executed and paused as they should...   5) Vibration: In the options, I definitely see a \\"Vibration\\" setting. However, there is no vibration utilized in the game!!!  6) Temperature: Perhaps this is an isolated issue, but anyone notice that if the screen stays on the main menu, the phone heats up rather quickly? I have never noticed this kind of problem before on any game, and it seems to be fine when actually playing the game, but on the menu screen, but my battery temperature went up all the way to 46C...    Honestly, considering the vast range of issues with this app, this app is definitely half-baked. I really think that it may be in PopCap's best interest to temporarily take down the game, fix the issues, and the put it back up before they get too many negative reviews for the game.    Seriously though, I am simply stunned. I was expecting quite a bit, especially after playing Chuzzle on my phone and comparing it to the PC version. A game with such a vast audience, such as this one, should be tested on a variety of devices completely before release.
B00466HM28|5.0|I haven't been able to spend too much time with this device yet, but am already convinced that it was well worth the small price tag.  Great for beginners because of the low price--and great for experts because of the portability and quality build.  While some folks don't prefer the toy-sized keys (which it does have) others quite like them; they throw back to the 1980's consumer casio synths.  The keys (while small) are quite nice, especially compared to Korg's nano-key which is marketed in the same class, but honestly doesn't compare.  The nano feels like you're pressing buttons--this Akai feels like you're playing keys.    The pads aren't as sensitive as I might like, but they do the job. Especially for the price.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I had a banner ad on my android phone for a free Angry Birds w/no ads. I clicked and downloaded it; then find a charge from Amazon for .99. They refunded me, but the point they charged me with no authority to do so, leaves a bit of a bad taste. Great game to waste time at an airport, or waiting for a date to show.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't install on ORIGINAL DROID. Although it does say DROID in the compatible list. But then DROID 2 and whatnot in parenthesis?
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I've been waiting for the longest time and today (OH! Happy Day!) I see PvZ is available as the free app. I excitedly click on the FREE button and get the pop-up that my device isn't eligible. Fail. Fail. Fail. Why would you do this to uuuuuusssss?!?!??!
0545302862|5.0|I loved everyone of these books and am disappointed I haven't seen the movies.  Kids said the movies are good.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works on my rooted lg Optimus as long as it's plugged in. It still worked if it wasn't plugged in but would shut off randomly.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I ran into two problems with this application. When I updated phones I was unable to bring over my downloaded versions so I no longer have an offline niv.  I also discovered that you shouldn't try to dl more than one version at a time when I was setting up my new phone. This caused an instant fc on my droid x.  Other than those two issues it has been an excellent resource.  Enjoy.
159562015X|1.0|do not purchase this used. if you purchase this used, you will not receive a code #  that you need to have to use the book. basically, i had to drive into town in short order (assignment due) and spend big $$$ to get a new version. dealer did not answer my complaint.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|For the second time in a matter of days I have been seduced by advertising Amazon is throwing all over the world, gone through the hassle downloading and setting up their naff software and attempted to download the product they are hyping so much only to find it's not available in my region.  What the hell amazon? You are an international company - start acting like one or at least don't taunt the rest of the world with the advertising for the special treatment you seem so keen on lavishing only on the US. So, again, I came for the download and got at waste of time.  1 star.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|Not a fan of country music, I really didn't know what to expect when this movie was sent to me as a gift. But, I found out! I was amazed that TRON's actor Hedlund could entertain with such great acting and singing!All players did a bang-up job in telling the story of a fall from grace, and unconditional love.<br /><br />I have studied both movies intensely. The music is great in both, and as a result, I'm going to buy me a cowboy hat and be country when country is required! If this movie does not produce tears in at least four spots where the message is a poignant one, then something is wrong. To those who submitted low reviews, give this movie another chance. Watch it again!<br />Y'all come back, hear?
1402760663|5.0|This illustrated edition is a very beautiful book in terms of its binding, quality, the many photographs inside and its information.  But the story remains the same. Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee: The Illustrated Edition:  An Indian History of the American West by Dee Brown tells us of the same injustices that have been done to our Native American co-inhabitants of this country. We see how the first white men and women who came to New England were helped by the Indians or else starvation would have been their end. Brown even goes before those years to the days of Columbus and other explorers who used native peoples to their own advantage. We also read about the westward displacement of people who were driven from their homes and forced to move to a different part of the country, on foot.  President Andrew Jackson moved thousands farther west in what became know as the \\"trail of tears.\\"  As a retrospective newspaper indexer I read the firsthand account of this in an old newspaper from the times, and President Jackson said that this was for their own good.  When reading about the Trail of Tears, I failed to see how that could be.    If you've read the book, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee, this edition makes an excellent addition to a home library.  Illustrations always help to tell a story as well, and sometimes better, than words.  In this book, you get both.
0765356139|4.0|Brandon Sanderson's THE WELL OF ASCENSION is a worthy sequel to MISTBORN, but I must admit that at times I found myself somewhat bored while reading it. In the first novel, Sanderson achieved something remarkable; he created a wholly unique and interesting new world complete with fascinating characters, distinctive and alien landscapes, and a form of magic that is understandable, easily imagined yet highly original. I was totally captivated by his vision and eager to dive back into this world a second time.<br /><br />The second book does a good job of fleshing out the world, adding new information that paints an ever more detailed picture of the landscapes, and expanding our understanding of the magic involved. I was particularly fascinated by the Terris culture and methodology. New characters, villains and beasties of various sorts are added to the mix to create tensions required of a good fantasy novel, and the core motivations of the story are compelling enough to make you want to find out what's going to happen next. But unfortunately, I think Sanderson spent a little too much time delving the depths of some character's emotions and it caused the story to drag somewhat. It was never so slow that I wanted to give up on the story, I just wished that Sanderson would pick up the pace a bit in some places.<br /><br />The various story lines were mostly good, with interesting convergences, twists and turns to keep the pages turning. There were some genuine surprises and shocking plot twists, the resolutions within the context of the story were pleasing and will make reading the third installment in the trilogy mandatory. I say mostly, because I did have a problem with some of the logistics along the way. Without giving away too much of the story, I'll just say that large groups of people were moving without any coherent plan of action; more like: \\"Let's go over here and see what happens.\\" I also felt that - for a city under seige - it was awfully easy for some folks (Sazed) to get into and out of Luthadel.<br /><br />Like with so many trilogies, the middle book seems to be the most problematic for an author. They need to propel the main story and characters while setting everything up for the finale. THE WELL OF ASCENSION accomplished both objectives and makes me eager to read the final installment. In the end, this was a very good book and I recommend it.into and out of Luthadel.        Like with so many trilogies, the middle book seems to be the most problematic for an author.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've wasted hours playing the PC version, new I will do the same on my phone. This is an awesome game...even  better than Angry Birds. Works without any problems on my Droid 2...highly recommend!!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|The app started once but now crashes every single time. Really frustraiting especially after waiting for it for so long.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|We use these at work and they work great. I got the software to make my netbook a GPS and needed a receiver to make it all work. This is the best one for the price.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on Droid Charge no lag what so ever game looks crisp &amp; colorful on my Super Amoled Plus screen.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|After more than 40 minutes of \\"Download in progress\\" the progress bar is only at about 55%.  And I have an appointment to keep.  Unworkable.  Unacceptable.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have 4G service with truly unlimited data. Let me download the game on my phone or issue a refund.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|been waiting for this game, since playing the chinese knock off on my droid, a year ago. after getting a new phone, and being able to play the game more. it was a lot of fun. the size of the app i think could be smaller. works great on the droid bionic
B0052UZIFA|1.0|App is identical to PC which is cool.  Sadly, after level 2 the app begins to lag and will hard lock on the Vibrant.  :(<br /><br />Will leave installed until next update but I think its still going to be a no-go for Vibrant Galaxy S owners.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|why would you exclude the motorla droid? It has the same capabilities as the Droid 2. just because it is an older phone does not make it an outdated phone.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Disappointed to see that this is not available for my Motorola Droid.  I wish Amazon would provide more compatibility details when they advertise these deals - it leaves one with a sour taste in the mouth when the app is not compatible with your product.
0307913090|4.0|I had never heard of this series of books before the series on HBO; so I decided to get this to get a better feel (since most movies and TV shows tend to either re-invent or leave out great chunks from the books they purport to be based on).  This recording with Roy Dotrice (\\"Father\\" from the old Beauty and The Beast TV show, coincidentally co-produced by George R.R. Martin) is wonderfully read and characterized.  The story is more than a medieval fantasy--akin to the Dune books--it's a complicated political thriller that HBO faithfully adapts it's series to.<br /><br />My cd's arrived on time and in good condition.  Good experience with the seller.
0316098329|5.0|Rarely do books with this much praise live up to expectations (short-listed for the Booker, NYT book of the year selection, etc.). Child narrators are often a disaster but in this case, the recipe for literary genius. I don't think the gruesome nature of this tale works in any other format. Through the eyes of a 5-year old, what is pure terror for an adult is interesting, predictable in its unpredictability, and oddly, safe. Wish I could say more but I don't want to give away the hair-raising twists and turns. My advice is to pay very close attention to the language used by Jack (the 5-year old narrator) as he tries to make sense of things we regularly ignore or take for granted. Also, don't start this book unless you are ready to put life on hold for 10 straight hours....<br /><br />Bizarre and haunting, just the way I like my tales.<br /><br />cheers,<br />Todd
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies eats Angry Birds for breakfast! and free is even better! Why would someone give the app a a bad rating because of compatibility? Please let others know, but that doesnt make it a one star app.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have tried several times to download this today because it is FREE. Each time it has told me to connect to my wifi, and I clearly was! Now when I try to download it, the download link is gone! Amazon must have gotten tired of me trying to download this, and somehow blocked it. Bah! This sucks because I love this game on my itouch, and already paid for the game on itunes! Why won't this download?!?! :(
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Was told it would be free on opening day, May 30. Did not see it listed until May 31, and for $2.99. Game is worth the money, but I dislike the false info about May 30.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I've played about 3x. it's fun when it plays, but it crashes and restarts my phone every time. DROID CHARGE.
031261246X|2.0|I've been a fan of Mr. Russinovich's blog and programs from some years now. And so it was with some anticipation that I bought his first work of fiction.    Sadly, it's very obvious that Mr. Russinovich, while being an extraordinary computer scientist, is not (at least not yet) a compelling author of fiction.    The heroes are flat, lifeless cardboard cutouts; the plot is limp and lifeless; the villains are stale and uninteresting. An inordinate number of scenes seem to have sex inserted (heh) merely for its own sake, and not in a believable way.    It's also disappointing from a technical aspect. Seeing as Mr. Russinovich is one of the foremost authorities on the Windows operating system I was perplexed at the distinct lack of technical detail in the story. One would expect someone of Mr. Russinovich's background tend to write after the style of Tom Clancy when it came to details. Rather, he wrote like Mother Goose. It's one thing to gloss over and simplify the details for the benefit of non-technical readers, it's an altogether different thing to omit them entirely.
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Love this movie and it is even better on Bluray! I was very happy with the disc and the speed in which I got it mailed to me as well as the price! Thank you!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I started watching \\"Fringe,\\" well into the first season and was stunned as to how good the show was.  I made it a point to always be at home when I knew that it was going to be on.  As soon as I had a DVR installed, it was the first show that I set up to record at all times!  It's so different and keeps you sitting in complete silence & on the edge the whole time that it's on.  I just wish that Fox had enough sense to promote this show as it's quality that we don't often see on that network.  It's so good that it honestly makes you wonder...........\\"what if?\\"....  Please FOX network, keep renewing this show.....it's the best you've ever done!!  AND YES, I've bought both seasons on DVD.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|An excellent sequel to the original film & with all the bells and whistles that new technology can provide! A must have for any Sci-Fi lover and Action aficionado! Olivia Wilde is a beautiful woman that adds to the allure of this movie!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't run at all it just gives a green box I had to uninstall I think it is a hardware problem
0810993139|4.0|If you're after up for a laugh then get yourself a copy of this book. I haven't seen the movie so I can't make a comment on that, but books are always better than the movie.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Thanks again to PopCap for finally bringing this and Chuzzle to the Android platform.  PvZ on Android is amazing!  It is better than I could have imagined.  I'm a happy camper!  Now just hoping that an official version of Bookworm is in the works.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I absolutely love the Kindle app.  As a Kindle device owner, I can admit there are times you just don't want to carry that extra device.  I give Amazon major props for allowing their customers to access their purchases on any device they choose.  The app works flawlessly and syncronizes across all your devices, no need to worry about losing your place, regardless of what you're reading on at the moment.  You don't even need to own a Kindle for the app to work, so there should be nothing holding you back.  If you are an avid reader, this app is a no-brainer.
B00021HBGS|4.0|My son (who is almost 2) is obsessed right now with all modes of transportation so this is a perfect bath toy for him. He can't really figure out how to connect the road pieces but he enjoys sticking all the different vehicles up on the bathtub wall and playing \\"I Spy\\". The mesh bag is nice to keep them all organized. I bought this from Buy Buy Baby and it was a little more than the price listed here (but no shipping/handling charges).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Doesn't look any worse on the Xoom than it did on the NDS.  It seems to chug a bit at the very end of the levels, when it is showing you what just unlocked.  I did not notice any lag during actual game play.
0312430000|1.0|Ok, here we go again. The kindle edition costs more than paper. I will not be buying this. I am sure the public library has a cheaper edition.
0300169787|5.0|This book is superb!  From the cover; already there the magic starts, right through the ending; this book has it all!  Fantastic photo's; great interview, excellent quote's. I would travel to NY to buy this book!
B004EBZX6W|4.0|If the help was more useful, especially for us novice users, we would be able to take the great information that is shown and do something with it. Hopefully it will get a good update someday.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a great and fun game. The fact that its free makes it even better. Its easily one of the better games on this platform.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Truly excellent instrumentation and worth double what I paid for it.  My only beef was the pseudo-psychedelic video editing.  But you learn to live.
0452282152|1.0|I was highly disappointed with this book!  The language is simple and boring, characters are not developed, plot is not involving, ending is predictable.  It felt like reading a poorly written romance that you can pick up at a gas station.  I would not recommend it to anybody!
B002ZG99IG|2.0|OK, I saw this in theaters. Thank GOD i didn't have to pay for that ticket.<br />This movie just, isn't all that good. I mean for teens i guess its all that but you kinda see everything coming. She's crazy and wants people to like her. And to make it sexy they throw in some girl on girl action for about a few min.<br />I hate movies when you know how it ends before you sit in the seat at the theater.
B00133KFGW|4.0|Evan Taylor (Freddie Highmore) is an eleven year old boy living in an orphanage. He has never known or met either of his parents, yet he has known most of his life that he was not supposed to be orphaned and both of his parents wanted him. He can hear things all around him, in musical tones whether it be words, wind chimes, the sound of honking horns or birds chirping, it all has a musical resonance to him. The kid is a profound musical prodigy waiting to develop. Although he has never played a musical instrument, the music is inside of him. His belief that his parents are out there somewhere and love him, as well as the music he feels his parents somehow gave to him, drives Evan to run away from the orphanage in search of them. What he finds is much more than he imagined was hiding inside of him all along.    There he meets a con artist whose street name is \\"Wizard\\" (Robin Williams), who once a prodigy like himself shares his ability to hear music in everything around him. Evan chances upon a guitar and masterfully begins to play as his natural talent becomes quite evident. \\"Wizard\\" changes Evan's name to \\"August Rush\\", partly to promote the boy's talent, and partly to disguise him as he learns Evan is a runaway and there is a search being conducted to find him. Through a course of events, the two are seperated and Evan (now \\"August\\") hides out in a church orphanage where his talent is quickly discovered and he is soon enrolled at Juliard School of Music where he composes a masterpiece the school solicits the New York Symphony Orchestra to perform.    Evan's parents were Lyla Novacek (Keli Russell) who at the time was an accomplished Cellist with the New York Symphony, and Louis Conelly (the very talented Jonathan Rhys Meyers) an Irish singer and songwriter, who met on one magical night in New York and fell deeply in love with each other. Due to horrible circumstances the two never met again. Both talented musicians left their field of music and pursued other avenues of life. One in San Francisco, the other in Chicago, far from the child neither one knows even exists. Can the faith that drives a child who thinks he can hear his parents through the music they gave him, possibly compose a reconnection of these three lives?    This movie is fantasy, and oftentimes throughout, it suffers moments of great lack of reality, nevertheless by then the viewers attention is captured in the awe of it's magic, and reality is no longer expected. The film is charming and pulls on the heart of the viewer to let go and believe in fairy tales. The music in this film is incredible. Highmore (\\"August\\") gives a stellar performance of his character and steals the show completely. Not far behind him is the performance of Jonathan Rhys Meyers (\\"Louis\\") and Keli Russell (\\"Lyla\\"). All three of these actors were perfectly suited for the part in which they were cast, performing with incredible feeling and unique talent. The well orchestrated cast of supporting actors, including Robin Williams, give very good performances of their characters as well, bringing the script together in perfect harmony.    The DVD offers a scene selection feature as well as a few additional scenes which were edited out of the production. Most of these scenes fit perfectly into the script and a couple of them would have been helpful in their original place. The only negative I can give this film is that the ending was rather disappointing. It builds up for 113 minutes and just as the viewer is expecting to see the end result of a masterful script, the movie ends abruptly. The rest is left to your own imagination. Although it was all spelled out, and the right characters were in place for the moment they belonged in, the film does not deliver the visual crescendo the viewer is longing for. The audience is left screaming for an encore that is never given. I suppose the point was for the viewer to hear the music within themselves, nevertheless it would have been much more satisfying to have actually SEEN it! I highly recommend this film for your viewing enjoyment and a very nice addition to your DVD collection.
0547482655|5.0|I live in Montreal, CA so I was looking for the French version of this book for my wife's birthday.<br />The book is really beautiful, a complete version with the original wording, stunning inserts and images.<br />Think will be no better gift for anybody who can reads or is learning French, definitely a must have.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This app works fine on my Droid X through the very first stage of the \\"Adventure\\" series. The 5 stars is mostly for simply working despite the warning that it might not work on the Droid X, and that it also works smoothly, with no hitches or glitches either in the simple controls or the fairly nice graphics.    So, I award 5 stars but with a very large caveat since I only played with the app for about 10 minutes or so--just long enough to feel like I could legitimately say what I said above.
B003UESJF6|5.0|It is very funny, clean, unpredictible, there is no magic or sorcery which is important to me. My family loved it!!!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|I though when the first game ever came out it was, just not my type of game. After the second game, and then I got interested. Movies base on the game preatty good. Lot diffirent but just great story line. Not easy for moives to follow any books, or games, and bring it out to life. Just cant be done! TELL ME what book or game that came out that movie not only follow... None... But this movie Still give it a five. Good action, diffirent turns of events. Guess the Producer wanted to try some thats little diffirent and yet follow game path. I give it good call. Bring out diffirent charters to follow Alice. I wounder if later when other movies come out that Alice is killed off but story goes on. Moive Resident Evil, to me not only a movie about Zombies, but for this one, Hope of some kind.<br /><br />Pro. Good action, diffirent creators!<br /><br />Cons. there just too many to say.<br /><br />In all I still give this movie 5 star.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|An app for AnDROIDS that won't work on droids? How about you wait and make it available for everyone before making it free? That's dirty a low!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Same great game as pc. Runs well once you get past the load screen. Cant wait to beat it. Samsung Captivate
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Why oh why would you release a game for Android and not support the Motorola DROID family of devices?  I would love to hear the crackerjack reasoning behind that decision.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It is absolutely ridiculous that this app is not compatible with the original Droid. I could see if that model was several years old, but it is not even 2 yet. You have alienated a lot of users who were looking forward to this app for awhile now. This is an outrage and a disappointment.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|a fantastic port of a fantastic game, and what a surprise to have it premiere for free! thanks to popcap and their hard work.  also, thanks for the laughs with the achievement screen!
B000MV8XPG|5.0|I got this as a birthday present for my girlfriend's son for his 5th birthday.  he went gaga over it, and used it constantly in the sand box.  It is fairly sturdy and easy to use.  It hold a decent amount of weight.  I could sit on it and I'm 175lbs and it held up. It's a great toy!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Could be better in terms of graphics. Some low res images. Great fun, Its an awesome game. Can't wait to play more.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|What difference does a border make in an electronic world? After installing Amazons stupid app, following their 'easy 8 step process' they forgot to mention that Canadians need not apply. SCREW YOU AMAZON!!!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Game is fun, but hard to get into. Continuously freezes and requires a force stop. Running on Gtablet with Vegan tablet 7. 3 star for now.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The first was angry birds now this! It's free, it's got nice graphics, a lengthy adventure mode. Thank you amazon!
B0036EH3WK|5.0|I won't rehash the many things which have been said about the show itself.  Despite any shortcomings or unanswered questions, I feel it was a truly great show.  I will say a few things about the packaging.  I am also disappointed, as one other reviewer was, that this was not packaged in standard Blu Ray packaging.  I've had this problem with an X-Files 60-some-odd DVD set.  It was stored in a paper \\"book\\", which was really no protection at all.  Packaging for Lost is similar with this product.  I feel the necessity to buy some empty cases to protect my DVDs.  So with the Lost Blu Rays.  In fact, you can buy them here at Amazon at:  [...]    There is a bonus disc, where the titles of the bonus selections are listed here in the description, but it was difficult to find.  My brilliant little 9-year-old Seth saw the Ankh with the cryptic pictures inside of it and concluded that there must be some meaning to it.  He figured out that it had something to do with the lid and in following  the paper, he was able to find the hidden Blu Ray disc in the cover of the cover!  What a smartie!  Maybe I'm just dense!      Then there's the ancient Egyptian game Senet, for which rules can be found on the Internet.  It was so interesting to find such an ancient game, still surviving through the millennia.  Archaeologists think they have figured out several different possible ways in which it can be played.  My boys were just having a ball.  You can use the black light to see things on the playing board that you would not otherwise be able to see!      All-in-all, a great purchase.  I would only say please replace your disc book with a special set of disc holders and put your discs in them.  You can do this for $8.00 for 10 of them on Amazon, a great prics.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!  I can't get enough of it!  Audrey Hepburn and Rex Harrison are a great duo for this movie.  Audrey is of course beautiful, even when she's covered in dust!
B003L77GG0|5.0|No matter what, Smallville had integrity. There was a specific vision in place from the beginning. Not a grand mapped out vision exactly, but an idea of a show that charted the journey of Clark Kent from naive farmboy to Superman. Slowly over the course of 10 seasons they evolved the characters and true to their word gave us Superman in the end. Through production and cast changes Smallville always told fun stories that looked great (especially for a WB/CW TV show) and were exciting.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Why do you keep doing this for US only??? Are UK users going to be expected to pay for this when you release it for UK???
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been anxiously awaiting this game. Love the PC version and it is nice to have some PvZ on the go. Works great on Droid X.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|works perfectly on my Motorola defy running CM7 ROM. I'm in heaven now. Been waiting for this for so long! Graphics were never updated on iOS for the retina screen. I wouldn't expect them to be better on Android.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Still the best botanical tower defense game you can get, and finally an Android version! &lt;3 Works flawlessly on my Droid X.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The most addictive PC game is now on Android, yay! File is quite large though. Very good graphics, pleasure to play
B002G1YPH0|5.0|The shipping was fast and the package arrived in great condition with all parts.  The first thing about this is that the plastic clips that go on the fan are not real strong. I tightened one of them a little to much and it cracked. Still usable though. Be careful of this.   All in all it is a huge cooler. I bought another fan for this to make it push pull. It is really huge now. I'm hoping that it will clear my memory slots. I have not put it in my new HAF 932 yet, as I'm in the process of building my new computer. I hope to be completed with it in the next few weeks. I will right another review on this when my build is complete.
0345529057|5.0|The HBO series currently airing is a great companion to this four-part written series.  The show follows the books in great detail and the books give you more insight into the characters and their motivations.  Excellent!
B0050XFY4O|5.0|Forget the incest part-even forget the gay part--i have never seen in film a couple  so completely in love---the way they embrace and look in each others eyes when they fear separation makes me want that depth of love for myself like i have never wanted anything like it before-the actors were so good they made it look so real--i know its just the movies and in real life most times it fleeting, but the intimacy shown in this film truly makes me want to experience it for myself--the male leads are totally masculine and gorgeous but their relationship seems so real and again their love for each other seems so absolutely complete--Kuddos to everybody involved with this movie--especially the 2 leads---the interesting part is that the incest part in the movie sort of makes the intimacy so understandable--knowing and trusting from the beginning would affect everything in any relationship i guess-----watch it and you will melt at the end
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is really fun. People will be disapponted when they realize their device is not supported. I don't know why people are complaining about having to use Wi-Fi.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Works great on my Thunderbolt.. cant complain for free. Weird that there is an HD version leaked out there.. figured thats what we were gonna get today.. oh well lol.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|i love this game, but i can only give it 3 stars because it keeps crashing. i assume the servers are overloaded or something.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of my favorites now on Android. Yeaaaaa Fun game, easy to play and addictive. Great graphics and gameplay. Hats off to the developer
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've been waiting for this for a very long time. The game works but is very choppy on the evo 4g. the images look stretched and the graphics are choppy when unlocking a new plant. the game also seems to lag in there are multiple zombies on the field.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I think this album reveals the spirit buried deep in GaGa. I admit is is not like her old stuff but if you have no problem analyzing music then this should be no problem. Her vocals are top of the notch on this album. Among the track list, I would say \\"Marry The Night\\" is the best song on the album (to me). Her music now-a-days elevates from just being a genre of crazed popped out music and now has more of a meaningful rebellious feel to it. The album is filled with life messages really, if you didn't note - the album is called \\"Born This Way\\" for Christ sakes.  If your one of Gaga's MONSTERS (like myself) try it out, it really is a great album!!
B000E41MRC|5.0|I've been asked in class by college students how and why the German people had become so enthralled by Hitler that they could have done what they did.  The reasons are complex:  the economy, anti-Semitism, war reparations, rampant inflation, etc.  The simple answer, however, may be found in this masterpiece film by Leni Riefenstahl.  Hitler descended from the clouds, put on one hell of a pageant, and spoke in such positive terms that a large number of people wanted to believe, having erased all feelings of doubt.<br /><br />Even after 65 years Hitler still is enormously fascinating to those who abhor what his demagoguery meant and to those who yearn for power without effort, without intelligence.  \\"Triumph of the Will\\" feeds both groups.  It is the music, those insistant drums, the orderly lines, the pageantry, and in the end, Hitler's raspy voice telling the people that their defeats and ills were not of their doing.  People want a true belief, Christianity, Islam, Communism, whatever:  something that might be worth dying for.  And Hitler provided that.<br /><br />Voltaire wrote that he who can make you believe an absurdity can make you commit an atrocity.  True belief is to never doubt.  We see it every day.  It is just that Hitler was able to draw upon that ultimately in an unstable time.  The ultimate question, then, is could \\"Triumph of the Will\\" happen again?  Ask yourself that.  The answer may trouble you for days.
B001IF252M|1.0|Purchased from xcessBuy. Does not look like Apple product packaging (no identifying labeling). Ordered in January but haven't opened it because I should have ordered the DVI version. Don't really have a use for the VGA, which is lucky, because according to some reviews here it won't work with my 2560x1440 display. Went to xcessBuy storefront here and searched for \\"Apple\\". Most of the 31 products that were listed are \\"Used\\".
B003L77G8I|5.0|And so as not to spoil anyone, the finale did a great deal to restore my faith in the series as did the episode prior, \\"Hole In The Heart\\".<br /><br />While I admit I am a 'shipper for Bones and Booth, plot-device Hannah was *possibly* needed (trying to be positive and give the benefit of the doubt here!) to give Bones and Booth an emotional kick in the butt to see what - or more likely, who - is right in front of their faces. But I won't lie: I was relieved when she left...and David Boreanaz's performance after Hannah's rejection gets major kudos from me. But fate had other plans, in the form of a tragic event with one of the squints and the aftermath that led straight to the finale.<br /><br />And the supporting cast and their stories - most especially, Angela/Hodgins and the birth of their baby - also helped to add to the good and blur the bad, for me.<br /><br />It will be most interesting to see where the final few minutes of the finale takes us for Season 7. In any case, thanks to the upswing, I have pre-ordered this season's DVD set.<br /><br />Because, for me, even Season 6 \\"Bones\\" is better than most of the reality crap and other shows on TV now.<br /><br />But it will be a long wait 'til November 3rd's premiere! So the DVD set should nicely fill the longer gap (due to baseball and Emily Deschanel's pregnancy!).<br /><br />Update (07/11/11): Though Amazon does not yet have the date, TVShowsOnDVD.com says the set - on both DVD and Blu-Ray - will be released on October 4, 2011 (with a very tiny sneak peek of the possible cover art)!<br /><br />Update #2 (08/10/11): The finalized date per TVShowsOnDVD.com is for October 11th. You can see all details there.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I can't believe how dumb people can be. No support for the Droid? you act as if every game and app should work regardless of hardware limitations. The Droid has a slow processor and even when it was overclocked it was still limited by the fact it only has 256 megs of RAM. I had and loved the phone but don't rate a game poorly because you're trying to run it on out dated hardware.  do you show up to NASCAR on a horse and complain that you arent competitive against cars? don't be so closed minded and selfish.   as far as the game goes, it runs flawlessly on the mytouch 4G and they even bumped up the resolution from the iPhone versionso everything looks sharper. I have this game on the pc and xbox and still absolutely love it.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|75meg does seem like alot.<br />wish they didn't force WiFi, but give you an option.. my phone or mifi it's all the same to me.<br />anyway, it's a fun game, addictive.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works fine for my phone. Don't understand why app store  gave me problems to download had to come to the site and request download. New to the game but loving it.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I really didn't think I would like this type of book, even though I love Sci-fi. But I trust HBO and they haven't let me down yet. I am OBSESSED with these books. Seriously, they have become an addiction and my husband wants to put me in rehab. I read a lot, but rarely do you come upon a book where you are so engrossed in the characters that you cannot stop thinking about them, it first happened for me with \\"The Stand\\", and I would equate this serious to that type of book (although very different writing styles). The character development is done over the course of much action and you don't really get a sense for the richness of them until the 3rd book (IMO), but they keep growing in your mind the more you read, which I love. I can't wait to get to the 4th book!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|had problem installing at first but after getting a stronger wifi signal game downloaded slowly but surely. Once installed, had no problems.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my Samaung Epic 4g! Love this game! Have it on my Mac and Nintendo DSi. Graphics are better here and the achievements are a nice touch for extended game play.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have been trying for the past hour to download this onto my Droid 2, and it of course says download via wifi, so when I connect to my wifi, it won't load the amazon app store so I can download it, can someone tell me what I am doing wrong?
B00003CXB4|5.0|item arrived as planned - it was damaged due to faulty case. It arrived on time and the refund was made promptly.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally!!! I we get some great quality games like this. Game installed and plays perfectly. Much better than humans vs aliens, previously our only clone of plants vs zombies.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I've downloaded and installed the app for my android twice with the same results. On;y 3 pre-selected books were available to read a portion of. Could not search for other books....no other authors were \\"found\\"...even more notable authors such as Stephen King and Anne Rice...author unknown? Really? Not pleased with this product.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Stop neglecting the original droid owners.  I'll give you that at least you told us this time, but, still.   Shape up.
B00004CXT5|1.0|My granddaughtern has wanted this movie for a year and could not find it.  Finally I found it for her and sent it to her for her birthday.  When she tried to play it, it said does not play in this region which is Washington state.  Was not happy had to find another one for this disappoint girl.  I will never order another thing from here again
B0052UZIFA|1.0|installed on Archos 101 tablet and it installs fine, but you can't play it... you click open and it locks up for 3 minutes while it does whatever it does... i uninstalled right away! I'm sure it's a great game but they shouldn't release it till it works...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|GREAT GAME BUT I'M CHANGING MY REVIEW TO 1 STAR BECAUSE THEY REFUSE TO GIVE US UPDATES THAT THEIR APPLE VERSION HAS..BOOOO!!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Not working on rooted Evo Myn Warm 2.2    App goes to hour glass screen then crashes to home screen.
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Awesome game, but keeps force closing after about 1 or 2 levels on my Samsung Fascinate.  Locks up entire phone and I have to do a system reboot from recovery.  Makes it virtually unplayable.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|While the app works perfectly on my nexus s, there are issues with seemingly random freezes on my hacked viewsonic g-taablet.  Specifically, the app will become unresponsive and freeze continueing to play audio when exited until being force quit.  I think it would cause the system to freeze if not for the dual core processor...  Very similar to the pc version, but without the mini-games
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this on the htc Thunderbolt and it runs like a dream. The visuals look great and the music and audio sound great. This is a 5 out of 5 for sure. I'm not surprised old phones can't run this, this is a full game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting for this app to come to Android, finally its here and its free too! Works great on Samsung Galaxy S2!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game! I have been playing it on my apple device for a while now. Stop complaining that it doesn't work on you're device, its a good game.
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I'm a \\"Harry Potter Child\\" growing up around this huge franchise. I was first introduced to Potter by watching the first movie on HBO soon after it was released on DVD, since then I have been hooked - read majority of the books and saw all of the remaining films on opening day at the theater. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 1 does not disappoint! While I wish each part of the final installment were 3 hours long, the flow of this film is good and your left wanting more. The only thing that could be better is having an extended version, so lets hope David Yates is open to doing it!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great app I think its a bit slow to open on Galaxy Tab 7.It works ok so far ,moved to SD because to big.
0394527771|5.0|I just finished this book and I found it to be much more informative than I expected.  The author defines folly as mistakes that were seen at the time they were comitted in the cultural environment of the place and time rather than in retrospect with knowledge that was not available then by people who were highly involved and qualified to render an opinion.  Vietnam, which she spends more time examining than the other subjects in the book, was known to be a losing situation at that time by key players in the desicion making process.  Same with the British in the War for Independance and the sacking of Rome.  The author examines each example of major historical folly in great depth and detail with a very sophisticated style of writing.  She is a master of the history of these events and I gained an infinitely greater understanding of the subjects covered than I had previously.  For instance, I knew that the French were in Vietnam before we were, but I really had no idea that their greed and corruption was integral to our involvement.  I also had little idea of the culture surrounding the British ruling elite and how they came to make the decisions that they made since the opposition's perspective is rarily covered in much detail in this patriotic event elsewhere.  Additionally, I knew little of the sacking of Rome and the vast corruption of the popes and the church.  It seems that little has changed.  I would recommend this book for any one interested in a detailed historical perspective that is not merely a recount, but skewers those responsible for ignoring the known facts of the time.  Very interesting.
0316056863|5.0|so good!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Its plants vs zombies.  If you dont already know what this game is, id be surprised.  Finally after quite some time its made it to Android.  The gameplay so far is solid, but there are some slight graphical issues and sound seems less than optimized.  Not quite a straight port of the iphone version.  Many of the transitions and effects run slowly or just dont look good.  And on a flagship phone, id expect more.  Hope to see updates that address these issues.<br />Amazon also needs to stop with forcing users to download large apps over wifi.  My &quot;4G&quot; connection is faster than my home wifi and at work i dont have wifi acccess at all.  Nothing to do with popcap but an annoyance with amazon.<br />HTC G2
B0052UZIFA|5.0|It's about time this finally came to Android.  There is some slowdown (like. when you receive a new plant) but overall still the same great game. (Xoom)
B001AQO446|5.0|was just on amamzon tonight, it's been a year since I checked, so I decided to see if The Blue Brothers was released on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Well to my suprise it has a date of being released on July 26th, 2011<br /><br />I'm sure the price will go down since it's an old movie and only the die hard blues brothers fans will probably buy it.<br /><br />But either way..I'm launching this with a Blue Brothers BBQ and Movie party.<br /><br />About Time !! but at least it's finally here in Blu-Ray<br /><br />B
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I played it up to the third level and the app is using 89 M of system memory and over 60 M of internal memory.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|perfect in church and when I'm out and about.  I love the reading plans as well.  I highly recommend this app!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I purchased this for my husband as a gift.  He's thrilled with it.  It's been a few days and he's still \\"sonic-ing\\" everything around the house...  A grown man.  ANYWAY, it is definitely a plastic toy, but there is something cool about having something that works and sounds like David Tenant's sonic screwdriver.  I can see how if a person is too rough with it, it might break.  My husband has a bit of an issue getting the pen cap off without the whole nib (that what he calls it - see the black dohicky on the end of the screwdriver.  The non-sonic end) coming out.  The pen comes with a regular pen nib and an ultraviolet nib.  I didn't buy it for him to write with and he doesn't seem to care much about that function.  It came with 3 batteries, and that's good because as much as he uses it, he's going to wear the batteries out before I can hide it to get some peace.  I've been sonic-ed a few too many times.  I think any Doctor Who fan would love this.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on the Nexus One running CyanogenMod 7.  I feel guilty for being able to get this game for free.  Definitely worth the $2.99 price tag.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I read The Hunger Games, I couldn't stop till I'd read all 3 in the trilogy (all lendable Kindle books, BTW!  Yay! Thanks, Jenny!)  The books are riveting, pure and simple.  The plot is harrowing, and the writing superb.  Totally recommend, and not just for \\"young\\" adults.  A \\"must read\\" for adults of any age, IMHO.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|This is a great PDF reader, much better than the Adobe app. With the latest update it is even faster and easier to use.
B0042RJWTM|4.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE BUT THE DVD I RECEIVED WILL NOT RUN ON MY BLUE-RAY PLAYER.  RETUNED THE DVD AND RECEIVED ANOTHER COPY AND THIS DVD WOULD NOT PLAY ON MY PLAYER EITHER.  ARE THERE DVD'S THAT WILL NOT PLAY ON A BLUE-RAY PLAYER BUT WILL ON A NON- BLUE RAY PLAYER?
B00121QGUY|4.0|I bought this to replace my DVD copy that was stolen. I liked that fact that it was on Blu-Ray so I could play it on my PS3 and get the most out of the movie. Overall there were not a lot of additional scenes to the Blu-Ray than the DVD editon. Some scenes are longer on this edition than on the DVD. There is a nude scene which has to be a body-double of Piper. I don't want to spoil this edition of Coyote Ugly for anybody because in my opinion the extended scenes are worth it. Enjoy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just as fun as the original, and runs well on both my tablet and my phone. I look forward to more Popcap games on Android.
B000003C2S|5.0|This album is definately one of Death's best, it is their 3rd best in my opinion. There is nothing bad about this album, it has good production, great musicians, amazing guitar solos and amazing riffs and drum beats. There is only one song that isnt that great, and that is Within The Mind, i dont really care for that song, but dont let me ruin it for you. All other songs are AMAZING, James Murphy is Death's best guitarist (other than Chuck). The Highlights on this album are Living Monstosity, Altering the Future, Genetic Reconstruction, Killing Spree, and the Title Track. But all songs are good on this album, you must buy this if you are a metal fan, not Death metal fan, but a metal fan. if the vocals on the first 2 albums are a little much for you and you want more complex guitar work (the first 2 albums were already pretty complex) then buy this album, you will not be disapointed, and when you get this album in the mail from amazon, when you get the package and open it, you will feel like a little kid at christmas because it is so amazing.....or at least thats how i felt, but time to wrap it up. So finally, this is an amazing and underrated album, and i think you should buy it in a heart beat. Also another reason to buy it is because it is not in print anymore so when you come across this album buy it before its to late.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am going to have to agree with Lady Gaga...Born This Way IS the album of the decade.  Its the best POP album of the decade (kylie minogues Aphrodite is a close second) and maybe even the best pop album of the last 20 years.  This is true pop music with a dance/trance flair.  It is, however, not bubblegum pop in anyway at all.  Born This Way is very dark and somewhat scary too.  I cant really see these songs on American radio though.  Not even the title track even though it was a monster (no pun intended) hit and is played constantly on the radio.  Born This Way is europop....in the same vein as Kylie Minogue a little except nowhere near as happy and bubblegummy as Kylie.  The music on Born This Way does not sound like anything americans would like to me.  I dont think it is going to appeal to the masses like her last two releases did.  It is not going to have mass commercial appeal as evidenced by the lack of her other singles not catching on. It is going to have a limited appeal...her little monsters. In fact, this album will call out alot of her \\"little monsters\\" as little fakes.  If her little monsters dont like this album then they arent little monsters and they never were and never will be.  I consider it an honor to be one of her fans....one of her \\"little monsters.  Hair is a blast and will never leave you head once you hear it and You and I is a cool ballad similiar to bon jovi i think and its also similiar to one of Chers bombastic ballads she might record.  Electric Chapel is straight up Madonna from her confessions period and Bloody Mary reminds me of the pet shop boys.  Also, there is the kylie influence too.  Edge of Glory is pop masterpiece and Shceibe is downright weird but catchy.  Also, who cares if madonna has done it before.  So what!!!  Madonna doesnt own pop music or the ability to shock people.  Now its Lady Gagas time to shine and shine she does on this cd.  I cant get over how much i've been enjoying listening to it.  I guess i'm officially a \\"little monster\\" now.y a \\"little monster\\" now.
0670022411|5.0|When I read a book, no matter how lengthy, I expect it to end. Not necessarily happily, but at least it should come to some sort of conclusion. And I DESPISE the marketing and publishers who fail to mention that Oops, this book doesnt end, it's the first of a series.... So imagine my dismay when, 575 pages into A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness, I realized that there simply wasnt enough time for a decent conclusion. Aaaaarhgh!!!!! Other than that small complaint, though, it was a fabulous book and well worth the wait from the library. Reminiscent of the more literary (and adult) paranormal books like The Historian and The Company of Thieves, and yes, I will be waiting (im)patiently for the sequel.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|how could I resist.  love pop cap games.   even if it is a bit large, it is a great game.  free on amazon is a huge plus
1878424319|1.0|The basic premise is a dishonest marketing ploy.  Don't take the book too seriously.  There is no \\"lost Toltec wisdom\\". The Toltec culture died out sometime before the Aztecs came to power in the region.  They disappeared completely and left no written language.  There were no descendants (if there were a few, they were absorbed completely into the adjacent cultures and disappeared).  The Aztecs were puzzled by the splendid architecture they found abandoned, and invented some of their own mythology to explain the structures.  None of the Aztec mythology resembles anything in this book.  During the 1960's and 1970's some writers came up with their own mythology, claiming to have the \\"lost\\" knowledge of this culture.  This book is the outgrowth of that literary device, which has been shown to be pure fiction.  We DO know from archaeological studies that the Toltec social structure was similar to other cultures in that region.  They had an authoritarian culture where the ruling elites held complete power over the masses and they practiced human sacrifice, including children.  There is no evidence of the kind of philosophy described in this book.  What I am saying is easily confirmed through even the most casual study of history.  I'm no expert, just someone who is fascinated by the ancient cultures of Mexico.  Although you may enjoy reading the book, remember that it does not follow it's own advice.  The advice of this book is basic pop psychology, mostly good but occasionally flawed.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Same game you've grown to love on the computer here now on the Android.<br />After first installing it would get to the load screen then crash to the desktop. Once the phone was rebooted (Samsung S Fascinate Android 2.2.1) it loads/plays just fine now. It was annoying to have to get it over wifi, I download 100mb+ files on 3g quite often, and have not had any trouble. Don't see why this 74mb game would be any different.<br /><br />Edit: When the brightness sensor attempts to change the screen brightness the game will freeze or crash to the desktop.<br />When running the game and Pandora for more than 30min it will sometimes freeze or crash to the desktop. I've experienced this in constant lighted rooms where the brightness sensor is not changing things.
B003ZK58WM|4.0|I was a little intimidated by the size of this work, but I devoured it in a matter of days!  Too interesting to put down, especially since I was not that familiar with World War I history or period.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Although I wasn't necessarily happy with the ending of the movie, it was well done and enjoyable to watch. It answered a number of unresolved issues from the TV series, which was definitely canceled too early. Although Firefly lacked the panache of a Star Trek or Battlestar Gallactica, it was easy to see why it developed a cult following, as \\"space westerns\\"  definitely aren't something you see very often on TV or in the theaters.                                                       .
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I had purchased Adele's 19 album because of all the hype it received and I wasn't all that taken with it.  So, I was surprised to learn that \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" that I really liked hearing on the radio was by the same artist.  Overall, I have to say I like this album a lot more.  Along with \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" I am quite smitten with \\"Rumor has it\\" (The first and second tracks).  I have to say that now I am looking forward to whatever Adele does next.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Everything load in a few seconds... my old PC was a Quad Core Q6630, this is like having 4 of those.... Extra speed, great performance. You can really feel the diference!!     5 Stars, no problems with the installation. Make sure you get a 1155 Motherboard. I know that some people will ask ... and NO, the 1156 will not work on this one, get the 1155 LGA.. the ASUS P8P67 is a really NICE option.3 Pci Express, SLI ready, Sandy Bridge, USB 3.0 and 6gb/s Sata transfer.... a MUST have for a great price.     [...]
B003AO1SVS|4.0|I always appreciate an album in which the different tracks have different sounds/voices.  This album is one of those.  Good job.
1416550550|4.0|This book captured my interest on page one. I enjoyed the way the book bounced from one character's story to another and was always eager to find out what happens next to each one. The inclusion of the fairy tales is a nice diversion from the main story line. I choose books by the number of pages and some books I've read have been overly long. Not this one, though. The Forgotten Garden is very entertaining, and I look forward to reading more of Kate Morton's books.
0345529057|1.0|This would be a great package for Kindle, but it's way overpriced compared to the paperback. I thought Kindle was supposed to save readers money by reducing printing costs. You wouldn't know it from \\"deals\\" like this.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Well, why are you trying to download this if you're in the UK...? You may well ask, after all it states it at the top (admittedly in small type but hey). Possibly because Amazon e-mailed me to tell me about it on a .co.uk e-mail address. Doh! It could be the best game in the world but as an advert for Amazon app store its annoyed me before I even have the option to join. Well done, a triumph of marketing. Not.
B004WESFZW|4.0|Though the friends I saw \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" with were varying degrees of underwhelmed, I really enjoyed it. This isn't the most action-packed thriller, but I thought the characters were compelling and I felt invested in the story. I like Emily Blunt and don't have much feeling one way or the other about Matt Damon; both played their parts well, and though the romance seemed a little forced at times I found their relationship convincing overall.<br /><br />If you're in the mood for a somewhat thrilling love story that considers the concept & consequences of predestination, \\"The Adjustment Bureau\\" comes highly recommended. I've seen most of the films negative reviewers compare this to, and I'm not sure what the problem is - \\"Dark City\\" was good, but it's hardly a perfect comparison. Take the movie for what it is, and you're bound to enjoy the plot, both leads, and the solid supporting cast!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I purchased an original iPad just to play this game. I am happy to now pass that on to someone on craigslist and play on my XOOM now. You can tell its not tablet optimized yet, but thats only a matter of time. For now it runs just fine.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|You have got to be kidding me. This \\"Android\\" app is not compatible with the most popular Android device on the planet, the Motorola Droid? In a word: ridiculous. Clearly the developer is not paying attention to the marketplace. The majority of Android devices out there are Moto Droids (not Droid X, Not Droid 2--the original Droids are everywhere). This means the majority of people out there who might want this app cannot run it. Including me. Disappointed. If I could give a product zero stars this would obviously qualify. Metaphor: this would be like a tire manufacturer saying, \\"Sorry, but our tires don't fit four-door cars.\\" What idiots.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have a Droid Incredible.  I launched it once after it was installed to see if it worked, which it did.  Not having time to play it at that point I closed the app.  Now it will not open at all.  Very disappointing since I have been anticipating this release for some time.
0345522478|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I loved the story line and the characters.  I looked forward to reading it every night and hated to put it down!  This book has just the right amount of magic woven into the story.  There's a little bit of sex, some gore and a lot of twists and turns and it kept my interest throughout.  I recommend it and am very much looking forward to reading the next book!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|If you go into Eddie Vedder's latest album \\"Ukulele Songs\\" expecting stripped back Pearl Jam, you're going to be disappointed. However, if you go into it expecting somewhat of a mismatch of a record, with elements of \\"Into The Wild's\\" escapism, a Pearl Jam cover, plenty of love songs, guest vocalists,  and everything else in between, then you'll love it and appreciate everything about it. Things get started with \\"Can't Keep,\\" a Pearl Jam classic from the Riot Act album played on a ukulele by Vedder. The song doesn't sound too different then the original but the added texture of the ukulele brings it to a new level. The next few tracks leave you with a distinct feeling of loneliness; \\"Sleeping By Myself,\\" \\"Without You,\\" Goodbye,\\" and \\"Broken Heart\\" are just as subdued and sad as their titles sound. This is a tribute to Vedder's talent as a singer and songwriter: you actually FEEL his pain in the music and the lyrics. Things pick up with \\"Satellite\\", which serves as the lead in to \\"Longing To Belong\\", one of the best songs on the album. The added sound of a cello gives that little bit of extra depth and it helps create the kind of song you want to listen to on a lazy rainy day. \\"Sleepless Nights\\" introduces the vocals of the always-amazing Glen Hansard. The duet is simply beautiful, with the pair harmonizing all the song's vocals to magnificent effect.  Vedder also covers  the Mamas and the Papas' \\"Dream a Little Dream\\" and the uke classic \\"Tonight You Belong To Me.\\" Overall, Ukulele Songs is a completely charming, enjoyable, fiercely intimate, and at times breathtakingly beautiful album. I would highly recommend it to anyone!
B001HN6918|5.0|It's been a long time since it was firmly established that Dreamworks and Pixar were the front runners in the animated movie business. Every movie from their boiling pot is a gem, to say the least. In 2008, an unconventional 3D movie burst into theatres with talking animals as per norm, but now we have the Chinese variety. People were skeptical as to how this would turn out, but the makers of the movie, stayed true to the Chinese tradition of movie-making in their depiction of martial arts, and with a cute sprinkling of good old American humor and talented voice acting, this movie was a little more special than the other ones.<br /><br />As with most of the Dreamworks movies, success demanded a sequel and the producers and writers rose to the occasion and boy, did they deliver. Right off the bat, I would say one thing, `Kung Fu Panda 2' is a better movie than the original in every way.It is in no way a watered down sequel with many missing links and vain attempts at establishing a franchise. This, viewers, is what a sequel should be. This movie is bigger, funnier and more likely to tug at your heartstrings than the previous one.<br /><br />Ever since the Shrek sequels, Dreamworks has been accused of dumbing down the quality of the sequels with lots of pop culture references and mindless jokes that are only likely to earn a few chuckles. But no one can make that claim anymore. This movie finds its strengths and all its factors : animation, story and action sequences are the best out of Dreamworks' production house.<br /><br />All of the main cast including the titular Po (Jack Black), the Furious Five and Master Shen are back in this one. Jack Black has really found his footing and a most fitting role for him in the panda. It suits his voice perfectly and fans of the actor may even find both indistinguishable. The Furious Five, this time are a lot warmer to Po, now that he is the Dragon Warrior. Shifu, too, accepts Po to the fullest and tries to teach him how to achieve inner peace.<br /><br />This sequel follows the time-tested norm of sequels to delve into the main character's past or open up new wounds. The goose as it turns out, is not the biological father of the panda (Oh My God!). Pandas had been prophesized as the ones to defeat the peacock Shen, and so Shen went on a killing spree, harnessing his invention of gumpower to destroy all giant Pandas. Po is a survivor. Faced with this dilemma, Po chooses to stop Shen from destroying Kung Fu with his technology, and must make peace with his past. This stroy resonates the traditional Wuxia genre of China, which you might be familiar with from Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.<br /><br />The action sequences are masterfully directed in true Hong Kong cinema style. The dialogues are hilarious and consistently uplifting and funny. That does not mean this movie shies away from other emotions. One scene in particular is a tear-jerking one. And when you find such a scene in an Animated \\"Meant for kids\\" movie, you know this movie is special. I hate to take the name here, but, Kung Fu Panda just might be Dreamworks' Toy Story. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie snagged the best animated movie award away from Disney/Pixar.<br /><br />This movie is a must for all ages. If you have a soul, you will not miss this one. Also, watch in 3D. The technology has been used to great effect in this one, so far as to making me say this might be the best 3D movie of the summer.<br /><br />Chinmay Hota<br />Author of \\"Hits and Misses\\"s sequel follows the time-tested norm of sequels to delve into the main character's past or open up new wounds.

B0052UZIFA|2.0|This works absolutely great on my Droid X. That being said, it was a complete letdown after reading the reviews. It is very one-dimensional gameplay and not difficult at all. The graphics and music were poor, considering the size of the download. I'm going back to my more challenging games like HexDefense.  It is free, however, so at least no refund request is necessary.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I almost never review apps... but I am so sick of the idiots that run amuck rating things low on amazon.  And to whoever said &quot;didn't the droid MAKE android&quot; you're an idiot, go get an iphone. The droid may not be that old but the phone still SUCKS and DID NOT &quot;make&quot; android. The reason that phone is incompatible is because it doesn't have good specs. These phones are just like computers. Not enough ram, space, etc? Things aren't going to work!  And to everyone rating this game low because it doesn't work on your crappy device.... seriously? It is not Pop Caps's fault you have a device that is incompatible. Yeah I get that it can be frustrating, but giving the GAME a bad review because of it? That's just stupid. That's like me giving a video game a bad review because it's not on the console I want. Stop whining. You cannot give a proper review of a game YOU HAVEN'T played!!!  To the normal people; this is a great game! Yes there is room for improvement and I would give 4 stars for that, but they get 5 because of the afformentioned idiots. I miss the puzzle mode, but I'm almost postive it was left out because this game is rather large so it's ok. I would have paid the $3 for this game, it's worth it! But even better now it's free.  I love this game! Hurray for it finally being ported to the android users!
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|This download was the worst one yet. What on Earth is the fun in tapping a screen to punch a cat? Sure, I hate cats, too, but someone spent time on this? Try turning the hatred towards pesky felines into something more productive. &quot;Cat Drop Soup&quot; perhaps.

0307279189|5.0|Let me start with a warning- You may start running barefeet after reading this powerhouse fiction book. The very fact it starts with a injury due to running caused to the author intrigues you to read the whole book. before you know you are a tarahumara from copper canyon running 485 miles in two days without a break. Well the book brings to your knowledge that how there are men with nothing more than ordinary capability for running and covering great distances as if they were strolling down a lake.<br /><br />You open your eyes to sound belief about the following facts:<br /><br />1) Human Engines are born to be long distance runners ( explained by giving Homo Sapien example of Persistence Hunting)<br />2) You don't need expensive cushion shoes to run - The best runners have literally run barefeet without expense shoes all throughout history.<br />3) Running is easy but your mind cheats you to become lazy. Running is meditation, stress release.<br />4) We are Born to run as are bodies prove this by reacting rewardingly to aerobic exercises.<br />5) You don't need animal fat and protein to become an excellent runner.<br />6) Runners are freer from Cancer, Diabetes and all diseases that have started to plague the Human body in the twenty first century.<br /><br />There is a whole part of the book that brings to life the journey of Ultra runners(50k-100k Distance Runners) and how they came to realise that running is what makes them excellent in life.<br /><br />Ultra runner's race (100K) is what happens during the last part of the book which is  between the tarahumara's and the American long distance champions and it is considered one of the greatest races run.<br /><br />Read this book to -to run , to release , to become yourself and enjoy reading a well written, well paced book.
0316154687|4.0|You either like David Sedaris or you don't; I do. I love his \\"journal-style\\" humor, which he uses in an often self-deprecating way to allow us into his life and the strange things that happen to him, and his random thoughts on anything and everything.<br /><br />This collection covers everything from pet spiders to quitting smoking to life in and travel to Tokyo, Normandy, Chicago and New York. It's a somewhat disconnected glimpse into many aspects of Sedaris's life, fears, feelings, opinions and idiosyncracies (and there's no shortage of the latter.)<br /><br />This is a really fun book, which has been on my to-read list for a long time. I'm glad it finally rose to the top spot, because I really enjoyed it. And, I had to smile about the fact that it's not until the very end of the book that we discover the origin of its intriguing title.
0425241505|5.0|Very well written story. Not too heavy on the paranormal, not too heavy on the sex, not too heavy on the angst. A really nicely balanced book. The characters were likeable and funny, even the secondary characters were endearing.  It reminded me a smidge of how Kathrynne Kennedy weaves magic and faeries into the real world.  Anyway...can't wait for the follow up books, this will be an instant autobuy for me.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally, the popular Plants vs. Zombies that started out on PC, then released as a big hit on XBL Arcade, made its way to our Android devices! This is truely an amazing game on the PC, and it's actually a twenty dollar game on the PC, which I got as a \\"special\\" for around ten dollars around Christmas time. So $2.99 for one of the best indie games ever? Are you serious? That is very cheap for a fun, extremely addicting game.    I highly recommend that everyone who loves addicting, tower-defense-like games to download this app today. It will only be free for 24 hrs, so take advantage of it. Otherwise, the full price that this is offered for, I still would highly recommend it!

B00402FGEE|5.0|This isn't a SG-1 or SG Atlantis; the characters in SGU are real humans; you hate them, you love them, you support them, you wish they'd be thrown out, etc. It's what makes it dark, you don't have heroes you can look up and depend on; they will all fail you. The special effects are AMAZING, better even than most movies; superb acting on MOST characters (that Chloe gets on my nerves every time she comes on screen, she can't even cry, why can't they abandon her in a planet??). You look forward to the episodes, to the discoveries (and some ppl to the drama); i honestly wish there were more episodes about the planets they visit, a little bit less about stupid dramas, but this IS a character-driven show. It's really amazing to see SG completely reinvent itself, and do something totally different. The bluray version looks spectacular on my SonyBravia; you can see their pores!! Great product, great space drama!

B0052UZIFA|4.0|It worked perfectly on my Atrix until I moved it to the media area. Now the sound doesn't work... I even moved it back to the phone and the sound still isn't working. I guess I'll try restarting my phone. Otherwise, I love this game! I've been checking the Amazon App Store everyday, waiting for it to come out, lol.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Reviews on amazon compared to the official market are so ridiculous lol. Everyone on amazon complains about idiotic things, wifi download? who cares. It's 75mb and they don't want to have slow servers so they put wifi as a requirement, it's free, get over it.   That being said, this game runs perfect, took me 2 mins to download, played it on pc, xbl, and itouch and now android. Always fun. Runnin it on an Optimus V.

0240816250|5.0|If you are looking for one book to cover the technical aspects of film photography this would be it.  The organization is very well executed and the presentation is beautifully done.  There are countless books available for inspiration and exploration of the creative aspects of photography, yet there are very few that cover those technical.  And none that I've identified that cover them all and so well as this book.  I would consider myself an advanced novice and thus did not find the technical coverage to be overwhelming, but rather it is exactly what I've been searching for to take my technique to the next level.    I'll admit to finding the Amazon criticism puzzling.  The critics can't seem to get over the fact that digital photography gets very little treatment in this book.  As is clearly stated in the title and the description, this is a book about FILM photography and should only be judged as such.  I also can't understand those few reviewers that got hung up over the \\"racy\\" images in the book.  Honestly, I didn't even notice.  Those images clearly illustrated the technical points for which they were intended.  If I wanted to look at pretty pictures I would've turned to one of my coffee tables photo books.    This book is the gold standard for film photography.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Who decides what apps are wifi download only?  I pay for (unlimited) data service on my phone.  I should be able to choose how I transfer an app onto my phone.  This limitation is amazingly annoying because I never use wifi.    Also how did they manage to make this game use so much memory?!

B002BE7JEI|5.0|Misery is one of my favorite novels from Stephen King. I wanted to see the film for a long time but being a MGM release, I did not know what to expect. MGM is not very reliable on relesing good-quality blu-rays and they do not have the resources to do appropiate restorations like other studios. Then, I read a review of the BD on Bluray.com and the reviewer gave high marks to picture and audio quality and Amazon lowered the price to $6.00. It was an offer I couldn't refuse.<br /><br />Misery is a great film adaptation thanks to the source material, Rob Reiner's direction and the fantastic performances of Kathy Bates and James Caan. Bates is perfect as the psycothic Annie Wilkes and is a pleasure to watch her transform from a nursing lady into a maniacal person. She really earned her Oscar. James Caan is equally impressive in a role that demanded him to be in bed long periods of time. The movie is tense, scary, dramatic and also funny and that's what make it a classic thriller.<br /><br />Picture and Audio:<br /><br />Misery comes to Blu-Ray looking great. Textures, skin-tones and detail is clean and sharp. There some flickering in some scenes but nothing distracting. A great transfer through and through.<br /><br />The 5.1 Dts-HD MA is not that spectacular but serves the film right. Being a dialogue heavy film, don't expect this to bang the house but the mix serves the film right. Every sound is crisp and crystal clear.<br /><br />Extras:<br /><br />The bad news is that all the extras are on the DVD disc. The BD has none. While that may improve picture and audio quality, at least they should've include the audiocomentaries to go along with the picture.<br /><br />Anyway, the DVD has some good amount of bonus features: Two audiomentaries, a making-of feauterette, a conversation with composer Marc Shaiman, stalkers profiles, advice to stalked people, a diagnosis on Annie Wilkes and two theatrical trailers.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br /><br />Misery remains a classic of horror thanks to the amazing novel that comes from and the excellent cast and crew that went to make the picture. Unlike many MGM titles, the Blu-Ray features excellent picture & sound. The only downside is that all the extras are on the DVD but at least they gave us bonus material. Minor issues aside, Misey on blu-ray comes very highly recommended!!excellent cast and crew that went to make the picture. Unlike many MGM titles, the Blu-Ray features excellent picture & sound.

1401223176|5.0|This is one of the best Batman plotlines ever.  Jim Lee did an excellent job of drawing and establishing a new iconic image of Batman.  Most of Batman's teammates and villians are included in this book.  This will be remembered for years to come.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|An addictive game I've played and beat on the XBOX 360, now in a nice portable form!  Works great on the Droid Incredible.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Great game, awful graphics quality on my Motorola Atrix.. just like chuzzle I'm sure we wont be seeing an update any time soon, so get used to this games problems folks.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Arrived on time and in excellent condition.  As a Harry Potter fan, I must say this movie was better than the previous Potter movies.  Not that they all were not amazing.  This movie was epic, and left every viewer wanting more.  It showed a side of Harry all his fans were dying to see, and Emma Watson and Rupert Grint complemented the movie better than ever before.  It was full of triumph, had me in crying, had me on the edge of my seat and made me laugh all in the first hour.  The movie was EPIC, but i do recommend anyone watch ALL the previous Harry Potter movies before jumping in, or they simply will not appreciate the beauty of this new instant classic
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Graphics scale and look grainy, game slows down upon completing a level.     Will tide me over until an actual tablet version is released for Android, but this game begs for HD graphics in a tablet optimized version.
0553573403|1.0|I started reading this book based on some fairly serious recommendations from good friends of mine.  I have been reading fantasy all my life.  There's a TV show that has gotten rave reviews, and it looked interesting.  I would hate to watch this series without reading the books.<br /><br />Plus, this book seems to be the Lord of the Rings for the generation ten years younger than me.  I figured I really should read it if only to say I had read it.<br /><br />Man, what a task.  This book left me quite frustrated at the end.  Nothing happens of any consequence.  The characters are completely cliched people who are cardboard cutouts.  I still finished the book, and I would say it is enjoyable only slightly, because his writing can be quite descriptive.  But game of thrones is to High Fantasy what Pirates of the Caribbean is to the golden age of pirates.  It's just a shell.  This book bored me to tears.
0596809158|5.0|The book is 5-star as described by earlier reviewers. The kindle version has annoyances.     Like many, I'd like to replace thick, heavy reference books with electronic docs. My hardware is an ipad, but kindle works nicely on many devices. But for REFERENCE use, this volume's got a problem: The Table of Contents! Here's a fragment:    4.12. Reading Files with a Complex Structure     Problem     Solution     Discussion     See Also  4.13. Reading from MySQL Databases      Problem      Solution      Discussion      See Also     The same, identical subheads are REPEATED under virtually EVERY SECTION HEADING. With a reference, one wishes to quickly scan the list of topics covered. In kindle form, one can see at most 6 or 7 topics per page.  Plus \\"Problem, Solution, Discussion and See Also\\" REPEATED 6 or 7 times per page!  Really?    When viewing the book's \\"Look Inside\\" on the Amazon website, \\"Problem, Solution, Discussion and See Also\\" are not spewed throughout the Table of Contents. Presumably that is the image of the print version. So one can see about 40 topics per page while flipping thru the Contents in the print volume. And 6 topics on the kindle? I just want to know how can I get my kindle copy to be so useful and eliminate the annoying, useless repetition. Am I missing some trick here?    An orderly, repetitive structure is valuable in computer language cookbook topic treatments. Reproducing this standard structure 6 times a page in the Contents, crowding out useful information....is a painful annoyance. With a reference, one expects to repeatedly scan the topics. I can't believe the author permitted this. But I'm not dropping a star because this problem is with whoever created the kindle version, not with the book.
0812550757|5.0|Enders Game and Speaker for the Dead really speak to the writing ability of Card...they are two completely different style of books, but they are both outstanding SF works.  I was particularly interested in the Xenobiology discussions about the Piggies as well as the redemption for Ender at the end.  He did get a little bit too Godlike for me at the end of the novel, but I liked the ending.  You have to suspend belief for some parts of it but that is to be expected with a good SF novel.  Very interested to see where this goes next.  Overall, an outstanding continuation to the Ender saga.
B001UAVQVQ|5.0|The recording quality may be sub-par, but a) what do you expect, it's live, and b) that Randy still comes shining through is all the more a tribute to this guitarist's ability.    Face it, you're not buying a collection of live recordings to sample the the artist in a neutral environment in order to evenly evaluate their composition.  You buy Tribute because you need to hear Randy Rhoads, and what influenced guitarists who came of age in the '70s and '80s.  Want to hear why the cheesy hair metal of 1988 still has better demonstrations of guitar playing than 50% of corporately-hyped recordings of 2000?  Play \\"Children of the Grave\\".  Want to hear why you'll never hear great fret work on your car's radio any more?  Just play \\"I Don't Know\\", and imagine a musician walking into [insert big-name record company here] in 2011 looking for a record deal, with that as their demo track.    Whereas Ace Frehley is often credited as \\"the guitarist who made people want to pick up the guitar\\", Randy Rhoads is \\"the guitarist a whole generation of axe-slingers pointed at, and said 'that's who I want to be'\\".
160059672X|5.0|I wasn't sure whether to purchase this book, especially since one reviewer said there weren't instructions/patterns in it. I went ahead though because I keep seeing Sherri's name. I have never taken a beading class, but recently decided to step up my self-taught beading by purchasing a few books.<br /><br />BOY am I glad I got this one! No, the directions are not explicit. That's because she encourages the reader to let the beads lead in the designing of each piece. This got my creativity all hyped up, as I am completely unable to stick to a pattern, or even a recipe, in its entirety. She DOES give you projects and directions for completing them though, so don't think there aren't any projects in the book. There are plenty, and the styles vary.<br /><br />As soon as I opened it, I knew this was the type of beading I've been wanting to do. I create bead woven pieces with a needle and thread; now I can add this type of bead embroidery to my repertoire. Five stars!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'm crazy addicted to this game after playing the PC version! It won't work with my phone, but will play on my rooted nook! Gorgeous, flawless, and easy! Don't blame the game makers, they do the best they can. Blame the manufacturers who refuse to make phones with all the capabilities!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Same game I came to enjoy in the 360. Fun &amp; you'll spend hours playing this. Get it while you can!
0307887960|5.0|As a 50 yr old peri-menopausal woman who cannot seem to lose weight I decided to try this diet because I was desperate.    I did the attack phase for 5 days because I would love to lose about 60 pounds.  In 5 days I lost 10 lbs.  I KNOW some is water (I have a scale that tells me how much I lose in water and fat) but I did lose fat, plus it's been a great motivator to continue.  I'm fitting back into my clothing comfortably and I have lots of energy.  Unlike others, I never felt the slup at the beginning of the attack phase, probably because I already ate a pretty clean diet (just too much fat and carbs).  Also, whenever I began to feel tired, I would drink a big glass of cold skim raw milk (I adore full fat raw milk, but I'm giving it up until I've lost the weight).    I started the second phase yesterday - adding vegetables.  Interestingly, tomatoes, zuchini and onions on the grill were SWEET to me.  This would not have happened one week ago.    I'll edit this opinion when I've completed the second phase.  But so far, GREAT diet.    One good thing to remember about this program is that the first 2 phases are only temporary.  Going without fruit for 1-2 months is not going to kill anyone.  Plus we get plenty of fat from the protein we consume, so that won't kill anyone either (not to mention, we are allowed a teaspoon of oil on phase 2 for the oils).  A very flexible program.
B004S82OAE|5.0|I've completed an online class, and read 2 other books while studying for my CCNA. This is the first book that makes networks fun. I've spent uncounted hours studying subnetting before reading this book. However, the other methods I learned required memorizing large tables, then writing them down. Now I can subnet in my head! That is cool.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|HTC Evo 4G - runs great and is nearly identical to the PC/Xbox/iPad versions I've played. Well worth the download.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|The only thing I missed about an iphone was this game. This game is a lot of fun and runs great on my Thunderbolt.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I used to play this incredibly addicting game on my iPod Touch, but I gave never got the chance to play it when I got my Droid X and gave away my iPod. The WiFi download is kind of annoying and takes a while to do so, but I'm glad Amazon is offering this amazing game for free. Not to mention it runs really well. (Note: I'm running stock Motorola firmware 2.2.1)

0061537969|5.0|This book was a wonderful surprise! Immediately, I was hooked and wanted to keep reading. I finished it way to fast and I still want more.
B0051QIGP4|1.0|This review also appears on Epinions!    Pros: Nothing  Cons: Lyrics, musicianship, cheap production, repetitive and uninspired melodies, comparing of gay people to monsters and freaks, offensive, religiously inaccurate, and just plain old boring.    I avoided this album like it was musical cancer. Not because I was afraid of liking it. But rather because I just didn't want to have to listen to it. I listened with open ears and an open mind and wondered whether or not Born This Way would have any sort of substance to it. Firstly, does it live up to GaGa's debut record, which can be regarded as her version of She's So Unusual. Well, no, it does not. And that isn't saying much. Frankly stated, Born This Way is so bad, that we need a new word for bad. It is not bad because of the way she dresses; it is not bad because of the fact that she gave the album away with proof of purchase of coffees, game cards or cellphones; it is not bad because it premiered on a Facebook game: it is bad because the songwriting is very hollow, uninspired and generally lazy. It is bad because the melodies are boring and plagiarized. It is bad because it is simply not memorable or catchy. It's difficult to continually give one one-star ratings to Lady GaGa's music-it's just what's expected of me. But I hope people read this review and find the merit behind it. I genuinely did not like this album, and I still have no clue why people eat her up.    The hype of this record must first be address. Before promotion for The Fame Monster was over, little bits of information about this new album began to surface. It was hyped as being the album of the decade-of the century, even, and we should all be paying attention. But much like anybody under that amount of pressure, they aren't able to deliver. This was true of Cyndi Lauper, and it was true of Alanis Morissette. And thus, it happened to Lady GaGa as well. Unlike on her first album, GaGa truly took a whiff of herself and began to believe that she was the second-coming of Madonna. And as a result, the first single released from Born This Way, the anthem-esque title-track, was a direct rip-off of one of Madonna's better known singles. Except this time, people noticed the correlation between her and Madonna, and it wasn't positive. Was the song a hit? Yes. Was it a monster? (No pun intended-I wonder why she wasn't selected to be on Kanye's Monster). No. In fact, I would barely call it a success. It set the tone for the rest of the album, though: bad lyrics repeated more than anything on a Police song (and Sting loves to repeat himself). Its follow-up was Judas, another uninspired song that tries too hard to take it to the next level. Really, in a world where Madonna has done it all before, it was just a new middle. Not to mention the fact that her take on Mary Magdalene's story is wickedly inaccurate-for the record, MARY MAGDALENE WAS NOT A WHORE; SHE WAS AN APOSTLE.    But the singles didn't get real insight into the rest of the record, which is very, very long. But long doesn't equal quality. Rather than focusing on anything I would call an earworm, GaGa released a bunch of mediocre, haphazard tracks without any meat to them. Heavy Metal Lover has an industrial production that sounds more like tin than steel, and ballad You and I has a decent ending but a bland opening and middle. Most, if not all, of the songs on this record never go anywhere. They want to be showstoppers, but none of them are the least-bit impressive. The song Scheiße, which is German for what you do in the bathroom, offends my ears and my brain with its gibberish introduction and mind-numbingly bad chorus, and outside of Bloody Mary, which has a brooding melody to it, there's nothing I would want to hear more than once. Lady GaGa seems content to waltz down the road that Madonna, Grace Jones and Dale Bozzio had already carved out, all the while bringing nothing new to the table. She is not edgy, and she is not that interesting. But one thing that really annoys me is the way she seems to think she's the Queen of Homosexuals-she knows almost nothing about gay culture and the struggle we endure day-in-and-day-out. There is not a day that doesn't pass where we don't feel a little one morsel of shame or torture, particularly living in America. And songs that pander like Born This Way just make me feel like a spoon-fed baby without a choice. A friend of mine recently posted to his Facebook wall, that all gay people are monsters. When verbally slaughtered by his other friends, he responded with, \\"My name is Lady GaGa, and this is my message.\\" And he was right. Her lowering of homosexuals to mere freaks and monsterw and outsiders is not helping the cause, but only serving to destroy it. By the time the seventeen songs are finished, you will only feel underwhelmed, slightly bored and very, very sleepy. GaGa's voice croaks and roars like a kitten trying to be a lion, as her desperate grasp onto her fame begins to slowly and silently erode.
B002IFOY5C|3.0|The movie is one of my favorite Cop movies of all time.  I give it five stars.  Yet the Blu-Ray version that I ordered on Amazon.com is in Blu-Ray format but the picture is far from HD.  There are no features at all on this disc.  I felt as if I were watching a bootleg video on the internet.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Amazon doesn't seem to download as well as the market place.  Maybe they should make these offers through the market place to avoid issues.  At least I was able to find out these issues before I paid for an app from them.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been wanting this game on my Android forever. Gameplay is smooth and is working great on my Evo 4G!!! Not sure about other Evo users complaints... Try it out, it's free anyways. Does take sometime to DL and install.
B003UESJHE|5.0|I don' know what all the fuss is about with the swearing. People do that and it was actually humorous in the one spot where it happened.<br /><br />the show is very good. and for those that don;t know their recent history like i THOUGHT i did, this movie adds more detail to what you don't know.<br /><br />for those with speech impediments (like me) it is an encouraging movie to show you greater people then you have problems too and they, and you, can get over them with sme help.<br /><br />watch the movie
B002XMGGK6|5.0|I'm glad the reviews pointed me to this edge-of-your-seat film. It is exciting, suspenseful, intelligent and thought provoking. Jamie Foxx has one of his best roles since RAY. 5 stars+
B0052UZIFA|2.0|Tried on Viewsonic gTablet. Way too pixelated to play. If it was justa little pixelated I could play. Too bad I can't try after an update.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Super fun game thank you amazon! Finally on android, waited for a while. No longer have to use an iphone.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. No lag. It just works. Free? Can't beat that. People who are complaining, and get a new pgone, and it's obvious your phone can't hack it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally comes to Android! Played this on my sons ipod and couldn't wait to get it here. Don't let the size scare you off, it pushes to SD Card and only takes up 700 kb on my EVO! Fun game!
B004V6MWFU|5.0|This album show cases the ukulele's inherent playfulness and combines that with in the intimacy of one man and his instrument. It is as if you are sitting at a bon fire on the beach with Eddie Vedder.  Most of the album is Eddie playing his Ukulele and singing.  It is very stripped down much like his previous album [[ASIN:B000ULQV0W Music for the Motion Picture Into the Wild]].  If you like that you will love this. It is full of energy and emotion, yet laid back at the same time.  It is really great to just sit and listen all the way through.  It moves quickly as each song is sub three minutes.<br /><br />What is better than Eddie and his guitar??<br />Well worth the purchase.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Just downloaded and installed PvZ to my motorola Droid X and it played fine. Everything was the same as the PC version, that I could tell. I have a friend who has had PvZ on her iphone for sometime and I was always a little envious, since I love this game a lot. Now that it's available for Android phones, I am totally happy. I'm glad to see Android users finally getting some love, and hopefully with PopCap coming aboard, others will jump onboard too, and we can finally start getting some loving.<br /><br />If you love PvZ, I highly recommend getting this for your droid based phone. Apparently some people have been experiencing issues on older phones, but I can't say anything about that, as those friends of mine with Android powered phones have newer models. If any of them get this and report any problems, I'll come back and amend My review. Otherwise, well worth the purchase. Now if they'll only get Bejeweled on Android, I'd have everything I need on My Droid X.
B000W04S6U|1.0|I love the music of Halo.  While listening to Pandora one day, I decided to go ahead and buy the last three albums that I didn't already own.  The music is just phenomenal.  However, the jewel cases were all in some way damaged when they arrived.  One was chipped, another was cracked, and another won't let the CD snap into place because of damage.  Eventually, the CDs themselves will be scratched because of the shotty packaging by Amazon.
B000SEFNMS|4.0|The book was interesting because it explored the character of McCandless where the movie did not. I found it moving, enlightening, but of all it made me appreciate my friends and family.    \\"Happiness only real when shared.\\"    My only complaint with the book is when the author, Krakauer began retelling his own experiences rock climbing in the wild. It wasn't a huge deal to me, but in my opinion it slightly impaired the flow of the book. But, nonetheless, I enjoyed this book and recommend it...give it a try!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|The app works fairly decent, but why is it 4x the size of my second largest app? Did you guys create your own graphics library to use???
B001P06GX4|4.0|Enjoy putting your spacial relationship skills to the test in the challenging and rewarding game of Blokus. Aggressively build your territory by blocking your opponents and claiming the most space for yourself. Make the most of your own space using abstract thinking to order your pieces in the way that is most efficient. Occupy the most territory with your own pieces to take first place!<br /><br />Blokus can be played with two, three, or four players. The board consists of a large empty grid, and each player begins with 21 abstract shapes which they place on it in turn. No two pieces are quite the same shape, so careful planning is required to ensure success. A player's pieces may touch only on the corners, but never the sides, so they must carefully structure their placements in the most effective manner while blocking their opponents from doing the same. As the board fills up, every precious square matters, since it is very difficult to make room on the board for all one's pieces. In the end, the player who can fill the most area is the winner.<br /><br />Blokus has very a high skill ceiling, much like chess, but can be enjoyed by all levels. Children as young as five are fully up to the challenge of putting these clever shapes to use. There is learning to be had by everyone! The game is short in length, typically just 20 to 30 minutes, making it a wonderful choice for many occasions.  You can even play it in an online community for free! For a truly strategic game, I recommend the two-player version, since the four-player free-for-all has a lot of variability.<br /><br />I am not a puzzle-loving person in any sense of the word. In fact, quite to the contrary, I feel like I was born lacking the basic skills that pertain to spacial relationships. Such things simply make my brain hurt. The different twists and turns and every possibility are far beyond my ability to grasp, let alone enjoy! My husband, on the other hand, can think of nothing more enjoyable than a good puzzle. I bought this game for his enjoyment, but I must admit that it has gradually grown on me as well. In the beginning, I did all I could to avoid the humiliating experience of Blokus. It truly brought out the worst in me. \\"You're new to this,\\" my husband would say. \\"It takes time.\\" I wanted nothing to do with it. One night, however, I decided to replace my defeatist mindset with an honest effort and a better attitude, and... Voil&agrave;! The challenge of the game won me over. In fact, I am almost always up for a game now, and have actually improved immensely in my ability to work with shapes. Although I have never won a game to this day, I am encouraged by the progress I have made. I have come to view it as an excellent learning tool and opportunity to improve on those skills that I inherently lack. The progress I have made really is empowering!<br /><br />Blokus is more than just a game; it is also a great learning tool. I have benefited from playing it, and can testify to personal improvement in the mental department. It is very versatile, and its length makes it an attractive game choice in many settings. I recommend Blokus as a valuable game for the whole family. It really is a classic!<br /><br />**To view more game reviews I had written, please visit the \\"Advantage Games\\" review website using the URL on my profile.game for his enjoyment, but I must admit that it has gradually grown on me as well.

B004KIWGKK|5.0|Ordered this not long ago and totally satisfied.  For the money it's a great looking watch - heavy and thick.  It looks good casual or more dressed up.  This is a great all around watch.

B0051QIGP4|5.0|I am an extreme fan of GaGa, everything she does I love.  I love this album with the exception of one or two songs, this album may be her best.  This album barely came out and I'm already excited for the next one.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Move over angry birds and say hello to awesome!!! On so many levels this game provides a fun in depth game with strategy and planning needed offering fun rewards to work toward. Super fun
B004FOA84A|4.0|Fun game...wish there were more levels. Some puzzles easy while others were more challenging. Recommend this game to mystery/puzzle game fans
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I have P vs Z on lots of gadgets.  In my opinion it is much more fun, addictive, and visually impressive than certain other games that, shall we say are &quot;for the birds&quot;. This implementation,  however, needs improvement.   1.  Not tablet optimized.  2.  Random freezes on Viewsonic G-Tablet.  3.  Not on real Marketplace. (Requires installation of Amazon App, which in itself has frozen, and it took quite a while to install.)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was so excited to see that I can get my plants vs zombies fix on my droid x finally!
B003SWNRU2|5.0|I am so surprised that the cops have not been to my house, to get me to turn it down.....course, day is not over yet !  Accept ROCKS !  there is no question.  I was watching That Metal Show, and took the recommendation of the boys, and I am glad that I did.    This is one of the things that make me mad is when you spend your money, and get 1 maybe 2 songs.  Not this Cd, ever song rocks and rocks hard !     Looking forward to getting the bands other CD's.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I think this is the best of the series!   T DVD is in great shape and played perfectly. I'm totally happy with it.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|$20 more for the Kindle version and then a badly package (I read that there was no table of contents and missing pages - is this true?). If this is how the publisher wants to scam their customer, one star it is!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|As an avid gamer, PvZ's core gameplay is brilliant: easy to learn thanks to a great tutorial system with a well designed difficulty curve.  That being said, this port has some performance issues and is a HUGE file. Hopefully, the bugs will get worked out.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|plants v zombies needs a bit of code optimization. when you make a lot of plants, then try to pause midgame, the game stops responding to the touchscreen. i had to remove the battery from the phone to reset it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very good game. Great graphics and responsive controls. Night missions are a little too dark if I'm playing outside. Zombies and crazy dave are hilarious.
B0036T31YY|5.0|So under rated I never heard of it nor did any of my movie buff pals.  If you watch this thing very carefully, don't miss a beat.... great movie.  Excellent directing, editiing and up to par acting.    Nice.
B001BANK32|4.0|I read a few Stephen King's work such as Carrie, Needful Things, Cell, Different Seasons, Thinner, Misery. I am not sure why I didn't start with some of his stronger work like The Shinning. So, I went into The Shinning with a very high expectation. I am glad to say that it met my expectations and more. In his other works, I find that he is long winded and spent a lot of time on details of each character. And so I was hoping that The Shinning isn't like that. And it isn't. Unlike his later works, The Shinning strike a balance between character development without going into all the unnecessary details. It was so encouraging that I went and bought 'Salem's Lot. I hope this early classic delivers as well.
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|I was nervous but this book was really good. I liked that the girl stayed herself and did not get wierd. It was interesting and just really good.
0446677450|5.0|Very interesting book, especially the rich dad poor dad analogy is almost a true life of me. My poor dad (real dad) is a PhD, works hard, but ends up poor for his whole life. My rich dad (my father-in-law) never finished high-school, made a lot of money, and retired at the age of 49. I should read this book ten years ago.
B00004R99F|5.0|My earliest memory of seeing this film was in a room for kids while my parents shopped in what I think was a furniture store. I don't recall if I ever saw the full film, but I certainly saw bits and pieces.    I finally got to watch the full thing recently, after watching the snippets I caught on TV over the years, and I must say this film is just wonderful. I'm eighteen, and while I do have a soft spot for Disney films of course, this movie is special. Let me just say that I normally DON'T like Goofy--shocker, right? I normally find him completely grating on the nerves. But I actually rather like him in this film, and I don't mind the hijinks he gets into in here. Max, though, is certainly the star of the show, and a wonderful star he is. He is very much an real teenager: He doesn't hate his father, but it's true that he can't tolerate him for various reasons; he's shy around his crush, but he is brave enough to make a move--even if not necessarily as \\"himself\\". He's funny, sweet, and realistic all at once.    Of course, when reviewing A Goofy Movie, one can't neglect mentioning the Powerline music. I'm listening to it right now, actually. I saw a review on one website calling it annoying, which was part of the reason that spurred me on to write this review. I loved the music at four years old, and I love it all the more now. It's clean, but it also has that sort of something that grabs the listener's attention and makes you want to dance and go to his concert. He's no male Hannah Montana. The singer for Powerline has a great range, wonderful singing ability, and is passionate about his music.     While rewatching A Goofy Movie, one of the things that stood out to me is that this is perhaps the most realistic depiction of high school life in any cartoon. Take, for example, the scene \\"After Today\\". You have the comic book nerds, the preps, the jocks, the people who are too lazy/out of shape to actually do gym, even the goths (one of my favorite lines in the song is,\\"No more pep rallies to cut. Blegh!\\"). You even have somewhat skimpy clothes in this film on a couple characters, although it's good-ol' eighties' style.     I also was very impressed with the characters. Amazingly, in Roxanne and Max's relationship, it's not just Character A = bold, Character B = shy. Both are very intimidated about their first relationship, but are able to muster the guts to actually speak. This makes their relationship worth rooting for, rather it just being the \\"Oh, he's going for the aloof popular chick who's a flirt. Great\\" storyline that keeps popping up. Then there's Max's friends, with their strange little quirks when they could have easily been bland characters. Goofy and Max's relationship is also a joy to watch because it's not a \\"I'm right, you're wrong\\" thing. They simply need to learn to see \\"eye to eye\\" and meet each other halfway. Goofy must relax his hold and accept that the teenage Max is not two-year-old Max, and Max must accept that his father is crazy and a klutz, but is a pretty good guy and willing to do anything him.     Despite my high praise for this film, I considered giving it four stars because it was rather short and Max and Goofy's surface issues could have been fixed straightaway if they had actually bothered talking, particularly if Goofy had explained about a certain phone call. However, it turned out alright, and even though it isn't even an hour and a half long, it flows very well, better than some other Disney films in fact, and allows it to be a highly enjoyable tale. Please, do yourself a favor and get this film. You won't find such depth in many other animated films, Disney or otherwise.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|multitasking doesn't work, have to restart the app and it forgets all previous saved games.  love this game, have it for the ipad and ipod, but losing my saved game when I switch to another app and having to start over stinks...  5 stars when these kinks are worked out
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game will not even load.  Have no idea why, no error message just going back to the main screen.  I have a moto droid and wifi is on.  Very disappointed that when you contact the company popcap they don't have any trouble shooting!  Amazon allowed download and it installed just fine.  I have it saved in my purchased games so I deleted and redownloaded hopping it was a download error.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|Basic plot in a nutshell: A politician (Matt Damon) meets the woman of his dreams. It appears like they belong together, but destiny does not see it that way. The two are not meant to be together. Enter the Adjustment Bureau, an \\"agency\\" whose sole purpose is to make sure no one deviates from the Master Plan.     I was disappointed when I first saw The Adjustment Bureau. I thought I was sitting down to an espionage / Jason Bourne type movie, and what I got was not what I expected.     However, there were some very strong elements to the movie that drew me to it a second time: \\"AB\\" is a unique twist on the conventional boy- meets- girl love story... the movie is a hybrid of standard chick- flick and \\"Dark City.\\" There's a philosophical element of free will vs. predestination that runs deep in the film that some will love (myself included) and others will not. Also, the chemistry between Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is excellent, and I really enjoyed their screen time together. Their characters are very likeable. The chemistry between the two is strong enough that I actually cared whether or not he could outsmart the Adjustment Bureau and find his way back to her without them successfully keeping them apart- resulting in a handful of cross town chase sequences that are highly entertaining.     The DVD sleeve claims it is a \\"thriller\\" but that's a bit misleading. Yes, the chases are thrilling, but make no mistake: \\"AB\\" is first and foremost a sci-fi romance, and a relatively light-hearted one.     \\"AB\\" has its shortcomings: I felt the movie tipped its hat too soon: you learn too early into the film who the Adjustment Bureau is (I was expecting that element of the movie to be much more mysterious); and when the big mystery is revealed (why the two protagonists are not meant to be together), I was hoping for more.     Still, \\"AB\\" is a very enjoyable movie with enough \\"meat\\" on its \\"bones\\" to provide plenty of interesting conversation after the credits role. It also has good re-watch value, the kind of movie you can throw in any time when you want something different but not overly heavy.
031606792X|2.0|I'm halfway thru it--where Bella is changed and I'm so disappointed.  The story should have went on with her being surviving and staying human.  It totally wrecked the whole Saga.  The whole Saga, hype, love for the story was build around believing in the love between a human and the supernatural.  Man, you blew it.  Just completely messed up a perfectly good story.  Was the author rushing and just got tired?  I don't know.  But as readers/followers, we need to come up with a new story to redeem Breaking Dawn pt. 1 and 2.  This story must find a way to bring Bella back to her human state.  I'm so serious.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is addicting and extremely fun. Even better now because it's at a very good price FREE, this is just like the other platforms and runs identical.
B004I654WQ|5.0|my son already had a copy of this movie but over time it had worn down and had many scratches. We purchased the new copy which included a dvd and blu-ray copy as well. The movie was well packaged and as stated in seller's note; brand new never used. We were very impressed with time frame in which the movie arrived, I would highly recommend this seller to all.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|This is the sort of film that reminds me why I love Korean cinema so much. I had meant to see it for years and am so glad I saved it up. This is the fascinating story of Oh Dae-Su (Choi Min-Sik) who gets abducted one night after a drinking binge and is locked up in a sort of private prison for fifteen years. During that time no-one will speak to him, tell him what he has supposedly done or how long he must remain confined. It is based on a Japanese Mange written by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya. It is the second part of the trilogy preceding Sympathy for Mr Vengeance and followed by Sympathy for Lady Vengeance - and they are excellent too.<br /><br />He is finally released and given a mobile phone and some serious cash. He sets out for vengeance on those that had wronged him and on his travels he meets and falls for a young and attractive sushi chef who he moves in with right away. He soon finds he is being watched and followed but the years of being locked up have made him resilient and fit as he had little else to do whilst being alone, other than build himself up. I do not want to spoil the plot but the more he finds out the more complex his situation becomes, with violent consequences.<br /><br />The acting is superb, no-one is a passenger and director Park Chan-Wook does a brilliant job. This is violent, visceral and yet stylish. It had me on the edge of my seat for most of the film and it is nearly two hours long, so that is some achievement. It is full of great lines that are heavy with poignancy, like - \\"whether a rock or a grain of sand; in water they both sink alike. And that is the whole point of this film; we are all equal when faced with the unspeakable truth of our own depravity. This is a must see for anyone even slightly interested in Asian/World cinema, I strongly suggest watching them all in order as you will get so much more from the experience . It is an 18 certificate and contains violent scenes and adult themes, but it will stay with as a stunning piece of cinema.a stunning piece of cinema.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Excellent port of this instant classic. I wish there were graphic options for stronger phone but by no means a deal breaker.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been waiting for this game for a while now. Played the other, Leave Devil Alone, and this one just feels better. Love this game and if you have a compatible device it runs great. Currently running it on Droid X.
B000C13Y2S|1.0|Although this flashlight is compact it is rugged, bright and very useful in tight spaces. The head has 2 positions to adjust the light beam. It also has a high quality switch making it difficult to turn on by accident in your pocket. Review update!<br /><br />After 3 months the switch quit working, it is now usless. so much for high quality  :/
B003YFIUW8|5.0|At first I was very put off that the book was written in the voice of a 5 year old boy, but as I got deeper into the book I came to realize how much I loved it. You may start off disliking the book immensely because of the way it is narrated, but don't let that detour you. The author does an amazing job of letting you see the world through a new pair of eyes that has no idea what lies outside of \\"Room\\" and \\"Wardrobe\\". Definitely a recommended read!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|just bought a Droid phone yesterday, after being on an iphone. I'm so happy to find this for the Droid!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is just a fantastic game overall and I can FINALLY play it on my droid! Took you long enough pop cap! Works great on droid x and DEFINITELY worth the price of admission!
020530902X|5.0|This book came highly recommended from my boss who is the Director of Human Resources at our company. She is one of the most articulate and highly respected women I've ever met and she swears by this book. I just started reading it and have already learned so much.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Still a fun game, even playing it after playing it on the iPad/iPhone/iPod/PC. :) Thanks PopCap, bring out more games like Peggle please!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I played Plants vs. Zombies on the PC and loved it. I've tried installing it twice on my Droid Charge and it's not working. The first time it loaded once right after I installed but I closed it because I wasn't ready to play yet. When I finally did open it, the hour glass came up, then a black screen, then it crashed.  The second time I installed it, the gamewould load to the menu and would ask for my name, but clicking on the field wouldn't bring up a keyboard. I tried restarting and the game would loathe menu, become unresponsive and then freeze my phone completely. Luckily I have a phone that allows me to pull the battery.
B004LSJCJM|4.0|As always,another great CD from the best blues player on the plant,Joe Bonamassa.  He  never fails with his brand of music and if you have never seen him, you have missed the BEST showman to come along in along time.Seen him 3 times and have tics for next show 11/25 in the Tampa area. Buy this CD you will not be disappointed!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Forget angry birds, this game is the true bell weather of a platform and its now on Android. This is easily the best game on any smartphone.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this on my pc and its loads of fun. I was worried about the android version because I have a HTC aria and I didn't think it would work well. I have happily wrong. It runs flawlessly! Great job popcap!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|graphics are great, but when i select a plant to drag it to the lawn it doesnt always works. using this app on xperia x10 custom rom.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I know there are a lot of people saying that since Bullets or Cheers this band has change so much that somehow lost too much in the way to be commercial.  The truth is that I do love Bullets and Cheers, Black Parade is awesome, but Danger Days is amazing.  It's pretty simple, if you like MCR sound, listen to the lyrics, there is no way not to love Danger Days.  Definitely worth the long wait since Black Parade.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|down loads but will not open on the HTC thunderbolt. works great on the xoom but graphics are for phone not tablet.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is so fun and very enjoyable for anyone. I encourage the person who's pondering to buy this game don't... This is a must have game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works fantastically on my fascinate. Never played P vs Z anywhere else so no clue about a graphics comparison, looks fine to me though. Droid users, its time to upgrade and stop giving one star reviews because your phone is old. Get over it and upgrade your device. And why would anyone be upset about a wifi download? Are you literally holding your phone in your hands shaking with anticipation while an app downloads? Good job PopCap, dont listen to the cry babies.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is awesome, exactly like the xbox version. It runs perfectly and is fast and responsive.  Thanks so much for developing this game for android.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works great on my HTC Thunderbolt! Lots of fun and a great port. Same great gameplay! No problems, reasonable load times, great visuals. One of the best games I have on my phone!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game runs really well on my Samsung Infuse 4G. It also looks great. I had an iPhone 3GS previously with this game on it, and the graphics appear to be identical. It runs just as well on Android and plays the same as well, which is great since this was an awesome game on the iPhone and it's now an awesome game on Android.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|One of the best games around. So glad it was ported over go Android. Really looking forward to playing it again.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|and some games you can only Download thru wifi.. so buy it, go to a free wifi spot and install it. you should be able to play it anywhere after that. 4 stars cuz i havent played it yet, but i heard it was good, and free. my favorite price
B0015DROBO|5.0|I truly enjoyed this book and I have read the entire trilogy. It is definitely worth it to begin reading the entire trilogy
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Downloaded today as the free app.  Installed it just fine.  I click on the icon, screen goes black.  A bluish hour glass appears, then the screen goes black again.  Next thing I see is my main phone screen.  I tried restarting my phone, but it still crashes.  Running Android 2.2 on the HTC Incredible.  Would really appreciate a solution to this.  Thanks.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love PVZ, and Amazon is great for offering us this piece of software for free. Great game, excellent free app du jour. Enjoy.  -Tim
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Great port of a classic game FINALLY available for Android. Backgrounds could be higher-res and look a little fuzzy on a tablet, and sometimes lags oddly but otherwise great. (T-Mobile G-Slate)
B0036EBARO|5.0|This is definitely a great album to enjoy if you are an 80s fan.  I bought this last year after hearing \\"Rocket\\".  I wasn't too excited about it the first time I played it.  None of the songs besides Rocket stood out or were memorable; they seemed to blend together.  I was a little disappointed, but I didn't hate it.  I came back to it a couple times and started to become familiar with the songs.  I liked it.  The songs have a soft, dreamy sound, with a bit of an edge.  It's somewhat fluffy pop in the clouds, but not bubblegum.<br /><br />Yep, it is inspired by music styles of the late 70s and early 80s.  It sounds like it could've been released in 1982.  To me that is a good thing.  It even looks 80s...from Alison and Will's heads amongst pastel-colored clouds to her pink jumpsuit, the brief track listing, and retro-style font on the back cover.  I bought a vinyl copy too, and it's very similar to holding an 80s record, if you like that sort of thing.<br /><br />If you hate 80s music, you might not dig this too much.  I love it.  Most of the songs are happy.  They make me feel good while listening to them.  It can't be written off as mindless pop, especially when compared to mainstream pop of the past 15 years.  This isn't the Spice Girls or Britney.<br /><br />Rocket-Catchy synth pop.  The lyrics describe a relationship ending, a significant other cheating, and wanting to send them away on a rocket.  \\"You're never coming back\\".  Funny.<br /><br />Believer-Sometimes I don't mind hearing it, other times I skip it.  There is a sound about it that reminds me of cheesy 80s dance films, like Breakin' and Stayin' Alive.  I could just see Finola Hughes and John Travolta dancing to this.  That's a good thing, by the way.  The video is fun.<br /><br />Alive-This song is upbeat.  \\"I'm feeling alive again, alive again\\"---I think music is alive again for 80s fans after years of mostly boring rap, urban pop, emo, and acoustic music.<br /><br />Dreaming-One of my two favorites on the album.  The song has a percolating beat, lush synths, and odd dream-like lyrics.  Alison's voice soars at times.  The synth music is gorgeous.  This one reminds me of 1984/85.<br /><br />Head First-one of my favorites when the album started to grow on me.  It has interesting layers.  The instrumental version is also really good.  I was hoping that would be released on a cd single.<br /><br />Hunt-slower and a little darker than the rest.  This and the next song are the most \\"Goldfrapp\\" sounding-like their previous work.  It's really good.<br /><br />Shiny and Warm-this one sounds a little more like 70s or early 80s roller disco while sounding more modern than Believer.  It stands out among the rest in first listens of the album.  After repeated plays, it's actually become my least favorite on the album along with Voicething.<br /><br />I Wanna Life-This is my other favorite on the album.  It sounds like a well-crafted 80s song with a slow start, building up to a big catchy chorus, with hope in the lyrics.  \\"I found a diamond that shines brightly\\".  The ending is great, with gorgeous synths.  I'd love to hear an extended mix that has an even longer ending.  The instrumental version is great.<br /><br />Voicething-A mix of music and voice samples with no words, very different from the rest of the album.  The first time I played it, I thought it sounded like a bunch of noise; kind of annoying and hard to listen to some parts of it, but it was interesting.  It's grown on me.  It's kind of weird and \\"out-there\\".  Experimental, I guess.<br /><br />The only thing that would've made the album better would be if it included an extra track, like \\"We Radiate\\".  But they wanted it to be 9 songs.  Still, it became one of my favorite albums and I still listen to it more than a year later.  It also made me take out my other Goldfrapp music and give it another listen.  I already had some of their other albums and singles, but never got into them beyond casual listening.  Thisalbum changed that for me.  I would rank the albums with this as my favorite followed by Supernature, Seventh Tree, Black Cherry and Felt Mountain.upernature, Seventh Tree, Black Cherry and Felt Mountain.
B000A1SZ2Y|5.0|This is a great addition to your camera bag as a novice photographer.  If you are just starting out, this will give you the opportunity to learn to shoot in macro without spending marco lens prices.
B004K4AUZW|1.0|I have heard Lady GaGa sing & as voices go her's is not bad-my problem is this,she calls her album \\"Born Like This\\" wanting us to believe this is who she is yet,she has flt out admitted her persona is a gimmick.she does outlandish things,writes songs about controversial issues she herself probably does not believe.i enjoy singers that just sing,if it's political or emotional fine,all the better but don't lie to me,don't try to sell me a persona or a gimmick and sure,we don't get every piece of the artist that's too much but we get enough that we know they're real.Lady GaGa came accross as a cardboard cutout on David Letterman the other night-she's not real folks,she's a gimmick,a one trick pony i'd be surprised if anyone even remembers her name ten years from now & if we do it'll be another gimmick,like flying out of her gal-pal Madonna,s butt dressed as the Cookie Monster! nobody wants to see that,nobody.
0312370849|4.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" is a wonderful story! The alternating chapters of character's voice is a bit distracting in the beginning but flows nicely as the book progresses. I did prefer Sarah's story but the other narrative is vital to Sarah's story getting told. Both touching and heartbreaking, \\"Sarah's Key\\" is a great read!
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|It took me awhile to understand the first season and the changing of their characters with the rocks but I really liked the second season and was upset they cancelled the series after it was starting to get really good. There's a lot of unanswered questions of why the Ancients had Destiny in space to begin with and I would like to see more of this series even with a movie to give it some kind of ending and not leave us in limbo. I wish more characters from SG-1 and Atlantis were in this SGU series. We have the Space Channel in Canada and wish they would have tried harder to keep this series going. I didn't watch SG-1 when it was out but love it so much I bought the complete series and Stargate Atlantis also recently and the price has gone way down so get them if you haven't yet. I've written MGM and joined groups on Facebook to save SGU and bring it back. Please don't close the Stargate... I can't stand all these horror movies they're putting on instead of space series! It would be great if they could meet up with the Ancients also. Come on at least give us a movie...
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Installed fine on my evo, runs very smooth, no problems, great game! Grab it while it's free, though it's worth the 2.99
B003Y5H556|5.0|This movie was really good.  Both my husband and I enjoyed it.  People keep giving it bad scores because they compare it to Twilight.  This is NOT Twilight so stop comparing them.
B0012GMU9A|5.0|Any good Rush Fan Knows, This is the ultimate.  Buy it and listen to Jacobs ladder in headphones.  Like your father before you. Minds will be blown
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Saddly the star of Spartacus Blood and Sand came down with a form of Cancer and was too ill to film a continuation of Season 1 of this great show. So the brillant minds behind the show decided to do a season that talks about how they got to where they are.  Gods of the Arena is a show of blood and violence, politics and raw sexuality that avoids the cliche exclusively heterosexual and shows the truth of how the men during the Roman Era had sexual relationships with both men and women and didnt think anything of it. They didnt title it, nor did they politicize it, they just did what felt good. It was an age of decadence and indulgence and this Season expressed it all.  I love the look of this show, visually it is very beautiful, in addition the story is engaging and the loose morals of the upperclasses is just commical at times.  Of course the violence and the blood is only the icing to this delicious eye candy cake.  Great show, there is something for everybody.
030746363X|4.0|So far I've lost 1 lb or 2 a week following the diet. I love the 'posterior chain' workouts. I've truly become a fan of kettle-bells, I finally see results with the 2 exercises in '6 min abs' and all the stretches and pre-hab exercises are great.<br />However, you have to buy a DVD or book or look up the exercises on youTube or [...]. If you don't get additional information from somewhere else, you won't get the full benefit of the following anything he says in the book.<br />I think the biggest reason I'm losing weight is that I am tracking everything I eat and all my work outs and graphing my weight vs body fat % each week. Also, after dealing almost my entire life with low blood pressure I now have high blood pressure. The fear of imminent death is a big motivator.<br />Basically, this is a book that you would use to look up where to find information.<br />The author recommends a buffet style reading. Perhaps if he didn't suffer from narcissism and ADHD this wouldn't be the case.<br />And it really seems to be geared towards men.<br />I would buy it used or borrow it from someone. Otherwise, go to [...] and look at the videos, blogs, books, and gadgets he recommends.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|loads and plays great on tmobile g2. happy to have this game again, one of my last regrets for leaving apple is gone
B0052UZIFA|5.0|thanks Amazon. htc droid incredible rooted... not overclocked though with custom kernel perflock off.  it works perfectly.   the game is fun and addicting.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|This movie really didnt have the BANG that most movies like this have, but I really enjoyed just going for the ride. I love Gweneth Paltrow so maybe I was just enjoying her as an actress, but where many people hated the story line and the music, I really enjoyed it.  I thought the perfomance that Gwen gave was really good and overall I thought it was a great movie. It just worked for me for some reason.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|love the game on other platforms. But it's too large for a T-mobile G1,  which is not sophisticated enough to save apps to the SD card.  so this app is useless to me.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Drew Barrymore and spunky go together pretty well. Conversely, Drew Barrymore and spot-on British accents do not. Still, she is captivating in EVER AFTER, a fresh reinventing of the Cinderella fairy tale. Off the top of my head, when thinking of kid actresses who were able to successfully transition into having grown-up Hollywood careers, Barrymore springs to mind, along with Liz Taylor, Natalie Wood, and Jodie Foster. Barrymore just has a knack for making you invest in her characters.<br /><br />EVER AFTER benefits from the class and charisma of Jeanne Moreau. The movie opens with her welcoming the Brothers Grimm and offering to regale them with the true story of the fabled little cinder girl who, it turns out, had been a living, breathing person. The story shifts to 16th century France.<br /><br />EVER AFTER frames the Cinderella fairy tale in familiar enough trappings, but it's the delightful swerves which had me big grinning. Barrymore plays Danielle, 16th century's Miss Fiercely Independent. Once the beloved daughter of wealth and privelege, the father-less Danielle is forced into household servitude by her cruel step-mother. But, despite grueling hard work and a scaling down of status, Danielle grows up a bright and irrepressible girl, something which can't be said for her insufferable step-sisters.<br /><br />There's a glass slipper. There's a fancy ball. There's even a fairy godmother of sorts. There's a handsome prince, naturally. Specifically, Henry (Dougray Scott), the crown prince of France, chafing under the doom of an arranged marriage. When he flees in panic, he ends up in Danielle's backyard and comes under fire from Danielle's well-trajectoried apples (she thinks he's a thief). Prince Henry meets Danielle again soon after, except that, in the second encounter, Danielle is masquerading as nobility so as to effect a rescue of a family servant. Henry, believing her to be a comtesse, is baffled but smitten hard. \\"Baffled and smitten hard\\" sort of becomes Henry's default emotional setting. What do you expect when you spring a plucky and enlightened girl on a 16th century gent? It's probably an eyebrow raiser when a girl back in that day drops Thomas More quotes on a bloke.<br /><br />Barrymore carries the film, although the supporting cast does a good job of spotting her. She imbues Danielle with immense likability and a strong sense of self. This is a heroine who doesn't require a prince or shiny knight to come to her rescue. She does her own rescuing, thanks very much. In fact, in a marvelous scene set in the woods featuring gypsy bandits and tree-climbing (guess who climbs the tree?), Danielle ends up rescuing the prince.<br /><br />I like that most of the characters aren't reduced to caricatures. Barrymore's Danielle makes for a wonderfully appealing and high-spirited Cinderella. Anjelica Huston and Melanie Lynskey add dimensions to their roles of, respectively, the icy and calculating step-mother and the one rather sympathetic step-sister. You get the sense that the step-mother may have genuinely cared for Danielle's father and that he may have proved to be her saving grace should he had lived. But you can't gainsay how vile the step-mother is towards her step-daughter. When a despairing Danielle asks her step-mother if she'd ever loved her, the cool, cutting response is: \\"How can anyone love pebble in their shoe?\\" It's gratifying what ultimately happens to Huston's character and to the other step-sister (the really vile one).<br /><br />But what makes EVER AFTER extra awesome is that Leonardo da Vinci subs in as the fairy godmother. He serves as matchmaker and a kindred spirit of Danielle's and, when needed, as a timely opener of doors. In a movie replete with fairy tale tropes and an ideally realized France dotted with fabulous castles and chateaus and inhabited by good-natured forest bandits, Leonardo da Vinci may have been the most magical element.s Henry's default emotional setting.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is by far the BEST game on android right now.  It's more fun and has better graphics than angry birds.  Its funny, and for today, its free.  Tablet owners, there is a plants vs zombies HD coming for tegra2 chipsets so if youre playing this on a tablet you have the wrong version so please rate accordingly.  Great game, everyone please support this game when it becomes 2.99 so android can continue getting quality games like this.<br /><br />Im a very picky gamer, but this one will have you thinking AND laughing the whole way.  Basically you are protecting your home from zombies by planting funny plants with funny names, zombie characters range from grandpa's reading the paper who get mad when their paper gets destroyed, to football players.  Not a gory game and Its fine for my 5 year old to play although the advanced levels will probably be too hard for her.  This game is a ferrari parked at a fiat dealership as far as games on the android market, enjoy it.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|As I have said in other reviews, I love Timothy Olyphant. That man could be standing at a bus stop for an hour not moving or talking and that would be a movie I would watch.  The man is just beautiful. So I bought this movie because he is in it. Not to say that the movie is awful, it is actually quite interesting. It is about a group of ET's that came to earth as small children escaping the invasion of their home planet. For reasons that I may have missed they are numbered and killed in the order of their numbers. So Number 1 has to die before Number 2, but the goal is to ultimately kill them all. They have the power to return to the planet and destroy the invanders so the invanders come to earth looking for them. Each child is partnered with a \\"protector\\" which oddly does not have as much power or strength as the child they are protecting. That kind of threw me, but whatever. So NE-Who. The movie revolves around Number Four -hence the title. He is protected by Timothy Olyphant (lucky ass) and is next on the list for execution.  Like I said it is a campy movie that has holes in it, but I have to admit that I did enjoy it on some level. What I did not like was the lack of care the main dude had for the dog. I am a dog lover and that dog was protecting that dude and he couldnt giv-a-funk that bothered me.  But other than that give the movie a chance, it is kind of fun. The cute monster from Beastly plays Number Four, so if you are into him, here is your chance to see him again.
B0038QGXHW|5.0|This is music that i can't stop listening to. Delicate, luxurious, heart-melting For All We Know and Where Can I Go Without You together with bravura & sensitivity of piano-bass dialogue in Body And Soul ... Music that worships the spirit rather than technical showing off. Listening, opening spaces between notes are a form of generosity if not love and both Jarrett & Haden are masters here. In some way, i imagine this music is a testament to a friendship, a testament to the irrevocability of the present moment. Some people swear on La Scala, or Vienna, but my heart, that old romantic, is drawn to Jasmine. Like a bee.<br /><br />And i like the humming too :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|one of the best games in android, works perfectly on my nexus s. please read description before posting reviews as the game is not compatible with some devices. just because it is not compatible on your device doesn't mean you have to give poor rating. remember that this game is free fot today so stop whining and encourage developer so that he can create more fun games like this.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Worth every penny. I love having the ability to have multiple versions of the calendar as widgets. Very well designed
B002ZG975Q|4.0|So I saw this movie because a friend and I were laughing at how cute the \\"ugly\\" guy was. I mean even as a monster he was sexy as-all-get-out. We laughed because we both agreed it wouldnt be hard for either of us to fall for him regardless of that mess on his face. He still had gorgeous eyes and a bang'N body. If you really wanted to make the movie good, they should have given him a huntchback and a beer gut and made him stank like cornchips and garlic. NOW THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A MOVIE WORTH SEEING.  The movie was cute and worth checking out when it hits the Movie Channel or Starz or something. I guess I should read the book, because I dont understand why the Olsen girl had so much power. What gave her the right the play \\"GOD\\"?
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works on my Xoom and Fascinate. Thanks Amazon and PopCap for a great game. Even if this doesn't work for you yet get it linked to your account it will.
B000J103WA|1.0|Cream live at Royal Albert hall hall came blank. The DVD was tried in 2 of my DVD players and no success.  It did not play in my neighbors' dvd player...  Do I send back the Blank DVD? or what?  Jim...
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|I can't help feeling the conclusion was, rather than a real cliffhanger, an open ended promise for more to come.  The trolling, negative reviews are, of course, unwarranted and too obviously mean-spirited (as if there's a sour grapes bone to pick with one or more individuals involved in the making of SGU).  Surely there is no doubt that Season One began with not just a hand held shaky cam, but some shaky footing script-wise.  However, there's no way anyone can short the acting, the excellent CGI (considering the budget, artistically solid), the \\"retro\\" sets, Joel Goldsmith's Vangelis-like electronic scoring, costuming and all the other collaborative creative talent.  I did question the commitment of the writers to delve into more serious sci-fi rather than the usual space opera, alien invasion and monster attacks that have dominated the film and TV offerings since the 1950's.  I am not a fan of the original movie (Roger Ebert's review is spot on), nor was I particularly impressed with SG-1 or Atlantis, or the TV movies, even though they were valid as entertainment (and very obviously aimed at a more general audience).    I agree there is some resemblance to Battlestar Gallactica, including an episode \\"Water,\\" involving running out of same, I would have preferred the writers actually consider ideas and concepts from some of the past sci-fi novels, especially those by Poul Anderson, instead of borrowing from past TV series.   Battlestar had the same problem early-on of some repetitive, slow episodes, and a lot of concentration on pairing up crew members. It's consciousness stones were the human-like Cylons  appearing as \\"apparitions.\\"  It's also notable to those put-off by the hand-held camera work referred to as \\"shaky cam,\\" but in cinematography, the \\"steady cam,\\" that Battlestar used this same technique.    As to the quest of Destiny, it seemed to be consciously headed in a direction explored many decades ago in \\"2001: A Space Odyssey,\\" in the concept of ancient aliens who \\"built\\" the universe, but instead of the gates, there were the black monoliths strewn about space.  The monoliths also had the same power of space and time warp travel that the Gates have.  Not to mention the original Stargate movie shamelessly borrowed the whole thing from a serialized novel of the same name (!) in Analog Science Fiction magazine.    While Season One lapsed into territory more expected from 90210, the writers seem to sincerely try to realize that, although a TV series is divided into episodes, the danger is becoming far too episodic in writing each episode.  It's why \\"Lost\\" lost me.    Season Two is not only redemption but began to actually have a real sense of wonder and the characters were more finely drawn and engaging, the action sequences suspenseful and exciting.  The cancellation was bad news and the fact that no Blu-Ray is offered as a choice is some kind of strange marketing strategy which is really dismaying.    The five stars, where I might actually give the series as a whole four stars, is obviously a response to the trolling.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|the game crashes during start up on the archos 70 tablet. poocap games seem not to work on tablets for some reason. wish i could play it. but glad i got it now for later when i get a android phone      *update* just to let people know that have the archos70 i recently tried to play the game today to make sure it still did not work and to my surprise the game now loads i don't know if it was because of an update or not but the game now will load all the way and play the game. it works well and is a lot of fun to play. I have not gotten to far in to the game but i will be back on once i finish playing the game and will give it a full review.     but it does work on archos70 Internet tablet. good times.      o forgot to add. for those that can't add your name you may need to just copy and paste your name. go to the web browser and type in your name then copy it. start loading the game and when it asks for you to type your name in hold down on the box and click on paste this will paste your name there and get you past that screen allowing you to play the game.    *update2*    so now that i have finished the game. it was a lot of fun i had never played the game before so i don't know what the graphics where supposed to look like but they where not bad on my archos 70 which is a 7sh in screen though through playing it on the device i still had some starting problems trying to start it some times. which may have required me to kill the other apps or restarts the device and then kill the apps then try to start the app before it would start. though i hope they fix some more problems with it technically. but if you really want to play the game on your tablet with the archos70 then you may have to put up with some start up problems but the game works wonderfully after it is loaded. except for the no keyboard problem at the first load.     great game with lots of levels and quick game so even after you finish the story line there is more. looking forward to seeing what else they come up with.
B00004RFCM|2.0|I was disappointed I. The condition the DVD case came in. Severely  cracked and damaged. I called Amazon and they refunded all my money. DVD seems to work fine. Thank God. You would think this seller would have packed it a little better than just an envelope. Broken plastic from the case was all at the bottom of the packaging. Bummer:(
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally this great game is on android and FREE lol works great looks great ...wonder y it isn't on the regular android market tho
B0052UZIFA|4.0|There were some choppy transitions (like when you collect a new seed), but otherwise plays great on my Nook Color!<br />The last PopCap game I played (Chuzzle?) had all kinds of graphic issues.<br /><br />I'm definitely looking forward to updates - especially if they fix performance issues.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It says it's compatible, but when I tried to download it I got a notification that it is incompatible.  Hopefully this will get fixed soon because I'd love to have this game on my phone.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've never played this game on the PC, so I can't compare it to that. After the issues with Chuzzle om the Atrix and reading this game's incompatibility with the Droid, I didn't have high expectations, but it looks like they got this one right. Not sure it's my kind of game, but it does seem to run well. I've only played a couple of levels for now.
B004NCLKJG|3.0|OK, 3 stars is too few, but 4 might be too many given the competition.  The recording quality here is poor for 1968.  There's no noise, but little treble. Some reviewers complain about this conductor, but how can they tell?  The orchestra is distant and sounds small.  The 1953 Furtwangler Rome ring on Gebhardt has more impact, for voices and even orchestra.  I just skipped this \\"Ride of the Valkuries,\\" knowing by Act III that it could not thrill.  Nilsson's Brunnhilde here is very good, but not much better (if at all) than for Leinsdorf, recorded well in 1961 studio.  Rysanek as Sieglinde is a vivid actress; all the vocal intensity and even screams you could want.  The leading men did little for me.  Stewart as Wotan was into his role but the voice wobbled a lot, Ridderbusch as Hunding was not intense and dark enough.  Both Leinsdorf (also with Nilsson and Vickers) and Karajan (Crespin and Vickers) have much better sound (Karajan not well recorded, but better than here) that make up for missing Rysenek's Sieglinde.  If sound quality were the only consideration (it's not) Solti is the best, but vocally it's less gripping than the rest of his Ring and the other Walkure recordings mentioned above.  I'm re-selling this set, not because it's bad (it's good, over-all) but Nilsson is better recorded on two other recordings, as is Vickers, so this one is unlikely to get another 3.5 hour investment.  This one is useful to get Nilsson and Vickers less expensively.  Lastly, if you want to focus on the voices, the 1956 Knappertsbusch ring also has a distantly recorded orchestra, but the voices come through with more vividness and amplitude than this 1968 mono offering.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|12 steps to DL.  App leaves security holes you can park a minivan inside.  Great product launch guys...  Um... can I have my phone back please, (after spending 45 minutes trying to get the *Store* application to even launch).
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Once again our beloved Sci-Fi channel has proven that it has little to no interest in Science Fiction. The fans have been cast aside, making way for the almighty dollar. It's a shame really. Now, to add insult to injury, they are only releasing the final season on DVD. Come on now, that is just stupid. It's 2011, not 2001. EVERYTHING SHOULD BE ON BLU RAY!! I will definitely NOT be buying this just because it is not available on BD. I doubt it will do any good to wait for it because as SyFy has made it abundantly clear, they don't care about the fans anymore. They only care about WWE (i say boycott the WWE for they are the reason behind everything horrible in this world) and new cooking shows. They need to get with the program and remember how they got to where they are today. THE FANS.
B004LZRSBY|5.0|It was an excellent final show.  Morten's voice was better than I've heard it in a while.  They all really made the effort to make this last show a good one.
B003L20ICE|3.0|Just seems this story was written by a couple of disgruntled, man-hating lesbians.  Felt bad for the Ruffalo character at the end, and was surprised there wasn't some sort of closure that allowed him to be seen as anything more than the interloper Bening's character so nastily called him.  (I guess that was supposed to be her \\"triumphant moment\\" - proving herself right all along about his \\"full-of-himself\\" character, and putting him in his PLACE, by GOLLY!)  He was not an interloper.  What happened was not all his fault.  And he didn't go looking for that family - the kids went looking for him.      I thought the acting was great and the story too.  But the ending was totally unsatisfying.  I felt cheated, both for myself, and for Ruffalo's character.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|i wish popcap had bothered to inform loyal customers that they wouldn't support the moto droid. i've been looking forward to this release for months.
B004UUKDNA|4.0|I first heard of Foster the People early one morning while laying in bed half asleep listening to an NPR interview with Mark Foster, founder of the group.  The interviewer peppered the piece with clips of songs from the \\"Torches\\" album, which was just about to be released.  I remember finding the tunes very catchy even in my half-dazed slumber.  I made a mental note to listen to the album tracks more thoroughly on iTunes before making a decision to buy \\"Torches\\".  I loved what I heard and quickly purchased the album here on Amazon.  I've listened to it nonstop ever since it arrived several days ago.  I'm really amazed that I'm so taken with this work particularly in light of the obvious fact that it is somewhere between shameless bubble gum and light pop.  Some have called it \\"alternative\\", but I honestly don't see it.  Anyway, I think my attraction to \\"Torches\\" is it's infectiously upbeat Southern California sunniness.  It just makes me happy (even the relatively disturbing subject matter of \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\").  I think this band is going to be immensely popular for pretty much the same reason someone like Katie Perry is much loved - they put big smiles on the faces of their followers.  They're not for everyone, but they're definitely for me!
B001NESPHC|5.0|One side of me says: what SOB was the one who hit her and run away!  The other side of me says: it takes the devil to do something to create such an angel  Hope we always enjoy this great singer and woman. Six stars if possible!
B00003CXZ4|2.0|I only watched half of it.  I tried, but this is a boring excercise in trying to figure out what's going on in a story that starts at the end and brings you back to \\"what happened\\" by taking back to the beginning scene by scene in reverse order.  If those scenes had been intereting in themselves maybe I'd have stuck it out, but for the hour that I sat through, this movie was a big yawner.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Order it from the website using your computer instead of amazon app to get it free. Great game anyways and worth 3 dollars.
B0050PYNP8|5.0|I watched this film 3 times at the movies...if you are a sci-fi movie fan you will love the references to past sci-fi movies and how much fun this road trip movie is:)  Can't wait for the blu ray release!  For all the idiots out there giving this movie a bad review   due to the references to evolution, get your heads out of your arses...it's TRUE!  The zealot religious fanatics I have encountered   are exactly as the ones portrayed in this film, so get over it!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|really good port of a really good game. i was worried it would of just been the nintendo ds port but this is clearly a great pc to android port. works great on all my devices.
6305252572|5.0|They don't make movies like this anymore.  1982 was a very good time for cinema.  The realism of early 70s cinema still lurked as the backbone for a lot of commercial cinema, and with dazzling results.  The film was shot on real film and it has that look.  In terms of acting, Murphy and Nolte just shine.  The bad guys are real baddies, and they put in very convincing performances - nice and creepy.  Another film with baddies like this: Eastwood's \\"Sudden Impact\\", made right around the same time, '82 or '83.        I saw 48 Hours a second time with friends recently.  There's a lot of back story to the plot which takes a good 40 minutes to establish before Murphy even makes his appearance.  But when he does, wow, the picture really begins.  I've kind of lost my taste for Murphy in recent years but this film clearly reiterates for me how and why Murphy suddenly exploded onto the film scene after having been only of Saturday Night Live fame prior to it.  A masterpiece in un-PC that fans of crime cinema and comedy will love assuming they're not attention deficit and can hang with the brutal first half hour of the movie which is in no way comic.    The DVD I bought looked great in widescreen but there were no subtitles as advertised on this link.  My English is fine but the friends I watched it with aren't native speakers and need subtitles, so I was disappointed by the fact that there were none.  There appear to be two versions in DVD - the one where Murphy has a cigar in his mouth, and the one where he doesn't.  I bought the one where he doesn't.  Don't know if the other edition actually contains subtitles, but might be worth asking a seller about if that's important to you.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|they did a great job, good graphics funny story lines, well put together... thanks Amazon app store!   20 words! what else can I say hmmm,
B004C5M282|5.0|If you liked Volbeat's past CDs you will LOVE this one!!  Definitely makes your head bob and makes you want to sing!
B000FC2PKG|4.0|Again, Gardener , has written a very fast paced thriller.  It is one that is very difficult to put down and it really has some very good twists.  one of the best i have read in this genre in a long time
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loads about as quickly as its iOS counterparts, and game play is smooth and accurate (to desktop).  I can see why some devices are unsupported, specifically in terms of processor and/or graphics module.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This software won't run on my Motorola Milestone.  Can't Amazon at least tell me why?  My phone is NOT in the list of incompatible devices.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|[[ASIN:B0049P1VHS The Walking Dead: Season One]]<br />If you love Zombie movies, this time in a series, then this is the one for you! This series is great. The script, the actors and actresses, the plot written and produced so well that this show puts you..the viewer right into the movie! Excellent special effects and edge of seat action and suspense. Human survivalism at its best in a plague filled world. Awesom
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Been looking forward to this game fire a few weeks. Very disappointed. Launching the game displays a black screen. The first launch showed an animated hourglass, but now nothing. Titanium Backup and hope for update soon.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game! Works great on droid x! Highly recommend to anyone who loves a good game! Own it on ipad and iphone and
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Only shows half of the screen, all bunched up and distorted. Probably an issue with MIUI but just so the development team knows.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come to Android forever and thankfully it works awesomely on my G2X. Hopefully we here Epic games will finally release &quot;Infinity Blade&quot; on Android as well.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Never gets past loading screen. opened menu once, since then it simply crashes upon starting and never loads at all.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|i love twilight and am trying to own all of the movies. It is always better to purchase them on amazon because stores always seem to be so overpriced.
B003L20ICE|1.0|The idea of even introducing into this movie a scummy creep that demands his \\"friend\\" hold down an innocent stray dog so he can pee on the dogs head is so perverted and deplorable.  You have lesbians raising a family & then meeting the sperm doner. That is the theme of the movie. A family.  What in the name of God does such animal cruelty have to do with the script? They didn't need to include that scene.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Runs beautifuly on my vibrant with CM7 But what's with all of those permissions?  I loved this game on my old iphone and now I can play it without any lag :)  Possible improvement: have a powerup watering can that you can use 2 times in a level that will heal a plant and give it a temporary power boost (shoot faster, more sun, knock ladders over, ect.)
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I love this app.  I can listen to stations all over the USA with it! Definitely a must have app for your phone.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Supposedly shouldn't work on an Aria, but seems to be running fine on mine so far. It did reboot sense after playing the first time, but hasn't happened since.

It take years of conditioning to strengthen the bone structure.

What a terrible book. I think TF got high and took the 9 PM Hulk flick too seriously. I think I can guess his next book titles    The 4- hour guide to World Peace    The 4- hour guide to build your own space ship to Mars    The 4- hour guide to become God    The 4- hour guide to mental disorder    .... Tim Ferris is just another smart sales guy, trying to use a common mans lethargy to earn a quick buck. Anything which comes without proper time and effort is not right....its just as simple as that.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Takes up more space that I would like, but a very nice and addicting game. Also, it's a little slow to load. Evo 4G.
0670022411|2.0|The first chapter got the story moving quickly, but once Matthew shows up it's down hill all the way to the Château--the book devolves into a silly romance novel and veers from the action for hundreds of pages. A bit of back-story is interesting, but when you create a 1500 year-old vampire, that is A LOT of back-story! I still have about 50 pages left and having a hard time finishing it.  Luckily, this was a loan from a friend, so no cash lost--only time.  I have no intention of reading the rest of the series--I'll just ask my friend to let me know what happens, sans the tedious details.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs Zombies really is one of those games that I can play whenever and still have a great time. So glad that Pop Cap decided to finally bring this to android. Thank you! Now where did I put peggle...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This was supposed to be free on launch day and it isn't. I am disappoint. Still, I guess three bucks isn't bad for a game this fun and addictive.
193659451X|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  Just what I was looking for!  I can always count on Amazon and its vendors to supply me with the perfect product.  Not exactly the type of book I ususally read, but exactly what I was looking for.  Thank you!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This huge download crashes my phone and only opens half the time.  i havnt even gotten to play it.  All my other apps work fine, so I conclude it is this app.  uninstalling and wont try again.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I bought this game for xbox and it is lots of fun!  Not sure if I'll get it for the phone due to size, but it is lots of fun!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Looks and plays like all the others but the quality of the graphics is weak compared to others. Kinda looks like a phone app stretched and that is not acceptable for a new app of this quality in a fast growing tablet world. After you complete a level the lag is very noticable when an unlock pops up. (ie, new plant)  Apple app is far better.  Xoom
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I don't know why people are complaining about a free game which usually cost $3... I've played this game when I had my iTouch and absolutely loved it. I figured having this game on my phone will be the best game I've ever downloaded for my Droid Incredible. People who are complaining that the game doesn't work on their phone are the ones who doesn't understand that some devices aren't fully compatible with this game... People...
0321701763|4.0|I haven't gotten very far in this book and that's not because it is bad, just the opposite. The used book came in great shape with the sealed CD of practice files. Thumbing through it I see lots of great stuff to learn, especially the 3D stuff in the back. This is a book written by the Adobe team of experts and if you want to study to get your Expert Certification this is one book to get. It is printed on good paper with lots of images in color.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally! I've been waiting for this game. I've heard soo much about it. How It's addictive, and most of all fun. It's all true! I'm hooked.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Not supporting the OG Droid is just a lazy developer doing a lazy port. The Droid still has more power then any iOS device and they couldn't get it to work? Shameful.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Major disappointment this morning learning that this app was available free - only to then be told it's not compatible with my LG ALLY.....Really?  WTF?!?!?  I love PvZ on my iPod Touch.  Sucks...big time.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesnt work on sprint kyocera echo. Tried with both tablet mode enabled and disabled. Please fix.please fix please fix. Damn 20 word review.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|okay first of all I love pvz, its the best! yeah its free so download right now !!! so the game works great but it does take longer to load and its laggy sometimes.the graphics don't look so good, some parts look low res or washed out. the game is decently worth downloading but I hope an update will come out to fix these problems  -HTC evo
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Like they said in the description, it's not made for Android Tablets...<br />But yeah. Tried it on my Asus Transformer, Dual core Tegra 2 cpu.... and full screen animations choppy and slow as heck, graphics are horrible too.<br />Come on PopCap, your first real big game for Android and you can't make it good on Honeycomb Android 3.0+?
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Uses 87MB of memory... even in the background! graphics are poor too compared to other great games. glad its free.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I just bought this game and it won't run on my Droid 1, however you may notice that despite that I am still giving it a 5 star review.  The reason for that is although I do wish I could load it up and play I knew it was incompatible when I purchased it.  When I was on my phone and tred to view the app of the day it stopped me because it was incompatible with my device; on the website the description clearly stated not compatible with original Droid; and when I went to purchase it I got a pop up letting me know it was incompatible and asking if I wanted to proceed.  Amazon clearly did all they could do to make sure that someone would not purchase the app and then find out that it would not work on  known incompatible devices.  Same goes for being able to download on WiFi only, given that the icon for the game has a big,red \\"WiFi Download\\" label across it.  So knowing it was incompatible you may ask why I bought it and why I gave it 5 stars, the five stars is because I am familiar with the game and it deserves the 5 stars and as encouragement for the company to continue to port games over to the android. The purchase is because it is a free app of the day that I would want if it would run on my phone so I might as well get it now so that I have it when I upgrade my phone to something that will run it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I got all excited to DL this and then find out its not compatible with my phone. Not cool Popcap. Not cool.
B00117S4GS|5.0|The show itself is great, just read the description for the synopsis. The reason i'm writing this review is to warn those thinking of buying the digital version.   If you do not have a tivo and/or PC, stay away from this version. It is very limited on the amount of devices you can download it to and even after you do, you can not for example put the single episode files on a flash drive and play it on a ps3 or a xbox 360. You are better off getting the DVD's.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|what a great band... and they never got the respect they deserved. Great concert, worth having this disk. interesting. too bad I have to write 20 words to say what i want to say in one word (amazon rule ;-)
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The bitmaps are obviously meant for 800x480 screens, but it's using EGL, so performance is mostly okay on my tablet. Full screen animations, like the sunburst at the end of the level are choppy as all get-out though.  Not especially tablet-optimized, but works okay.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Plants vs zombies is a great game on the pc, and now i can take the game anywhere and everywhere i want.
0060989157|5.0|Once you begin reading, The Dirt, there is no going back. This is an astonishing book by a band who lived by the rules of sex, drugs, and rock & roll or amongst no rules at all. I guarantee that you will never read a book as raw as this one and that you will love The Dirt on each Motley member of this distorted Crue.
B00192IV9U|1.0|THIS WAS A BAD RELEASE. THEY ARE JUST TRYING TO MAKE MONEY OF HIM, SOME OF THESE SONGS ARENT EVEN MJ.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|loving this game on the atrix!  now let's see if i can accomplish anything useful today.  twenty word limit? arrgh
B0052UZIFA|3.0|long reload if phone times out and needs to be able to move to sd card but with a good patch 5 stars
B0044EDD66|5.0|This album is terrific. Imelda's band now has Steve Rushton on drums and what a huge difference this makes. The music is so tight and energetic when it needs to be; smooth and oh so smooth when it needs to be; and boy can Steve really swing!!!    This band are doing what the \\"Stray Cats\\" did in the 80's - writing innovative new modern sounding music with hat tips to rockabilly and, no doubt, Imelda's roots in folk music.  This is the real McCoy. Real Musicians playing great music. A pleasant change from overproduced DJ/rap/pop.    Definitely a MUST buy for those who like great rock 'n roll and blues!
0061997811|5.0|I got this book yesterday and my 5 year-old son, who has no interest whatsoever in the franchise (he is more of a Star Wars' fan type), said \\"Wow, mami, we have to read this book!\\". That alone is testament to the quality of the contents of this book.<br />I can't wait for the weekend to come so I can loose myself in the universe of Harry Potter! :)
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Ignore whiners who complain about wifi. I have unlimited too and I am glad thet did this for those without. Wonderful job adopting the original game to Andoid! Enjoy hours of fun!
0312600844|1.0|I hoped that I would be able to rate this a 5 star book when I saw that the reviews were so polarized prior to reading it.  I didn't find anything redeeming about this book.  It's not even worth any kind of discussion other than it is a terrible book.  My personal conjecture is that all the people who gave it rave reviews must be personal loyal friends of the author.
0810979772|5.0|My 8 year old son LOVES this journal, he thinks it's funny and I love it because he writes in it a lot. It's a great way for him to practice writing while working out his own ideas and problems. Highly recommended!
0375836675|5.0|I absolutely loved the book. It was written as if i was there along with the main character just hopping along for the ride of his life. The book came the day after i ordered it in pristine condition. Thank You!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003QNXPUK|1.0|I have had this for less than a year and it's needed to be replaced twice, but after paying more to get \\"lifetime\\" replacements I apparently can't get replacements without paying more and then having to send back my old screen protectors. Save your money and go for whatever's cheap. You'll end up spending enough to get a new screen protector anyway each time you ask for a replacement, as well as spend time trying to mail back the old skin. Definitely not worth it.
0307719774|5.0|This book is so wonderful - it makes you think about your opinions on things and you'll get to see how they change over the years. I recommend buying two - one for you and one for a friend. It's fun to go through the process together, and, since it's a 5-year undertaking, it helps to have a friend to keep you accountable.
0316069353|5.0|The Fifth Witness is yet another pleasure to read from Michael Connelly. My husband read it in about a week which is fast for him. I am now half way through it and despite disliking Mickey Haller's client intensely, I am thoroughly hooked! Another MC must read.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Been waiting for this game to come to Droid for a long time!! This game is awesome, so awesome that even World of Warcraft made a mini game out of it! Works great on my Droid. The 76 meg is a big huge, but after moving to SD card it was 700 kb.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loved the desktop version and the mobile version is working well on my atrix.  I have a feeling many hours of my life will be spent playing this.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Whoever said this app didn't work on fascinate was not doing something right. Any way. Great app!! Just like pc version
0307477479|3.0|The book, overall, has a good start, and a good end.  However, it's not written with the smoothness that we usually see in the Mann Booker prize winning novels (this is anyway, not the one).  However, the reading gives a good taste of growing up, a good sense of life, and a new way of reading (like a power point presentation inserted in the middle).
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Game is awesome runs great on thunderbolt!! Big Thank U to Amazon!! Your appstore is Awesome!!! Can't wait for your tablet!!
B004XOGLBQ|1.0|I am a huge Pearl Jam fan and Vedder fan but this is just simply not good.  Unless you are a huge ukulele fan, you should stay away from this album.  Vedder's voice still is great, but without the accompanying band, this just doesn't hold up.
B0036EH3WU|4.0|Mine came missing the pieces for the Senet game. The rest of the collection is AWESOME and has lots of new things to see.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|ive played plants vs zombies on my pc and the android app version means i can now play it on the go! it won game of the year so get this while u can!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Rating this app one star because you have a two year old phone is a joke.  It is also 79MB because its an awesome game and very well done.  Stop trying to get new apps on your free droid phone runnning 1.x os.  You know its not going to work on your ancient POS...stop complaining when it doesnt.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|nope go figure im excited bout,this game and see it was released today downliaded it no problem on the wifi load up game gets,to the hour glass then goes back to the phones main screen, wow I have a samsung galaxy s any ideas how do I transfer the game to my sd card I guess I can wait a few weeks when its actually available on the android marketplace maybe that will help idk,  thanks popcop
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This game works well on the Samsung Fascinate (Galaxy S on Verizon). However it is a straight port of the iOS version of the game. I was really hoping that they would try and enhance it for the Android version. The Survival modes from the PC/Mac/XBLA/PSN versions is missing from this version as also the Zen Garden and the I, Zombie and Vasebreaker puzzle sections only make a brief appearance in the Quick Play modes which is again a reduced set of the Mini-games available in the desktop version.    Don't get me wrong, this is still a great game. And it has the complete campaign mode and most of the Mini-games in the 'Quick Play' section plus the Achievements but I would still say that PopCap has yet to fully embrace the Android platform. Looking forward to bigger and better things from them in the future!    For folks who have never played PvZ, GET THIS GAME! This game oozes enough charm that you will love the addictive gameplay!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is the best game on android. people who give it low score are on tablets. it says may not work on all tablets.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I AM HAPPY TO SAY THAT PVZ IS A CLASSIC,IT'S SOOOOO MUCH FUN AND IF YOU HAVEN'T PLAYED IT GET IT TODAY,YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!!!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|For sure the best book I've read in years, I bought it and, no joke, read it in the first half year over 10 times!     The storylines are active and always a surprise. I like also very much that part of the book is from Bella's view and part also from Jacob's. This makes a great change, as Jacob is very humoristic. Stefenie Meyer makes a great conclusion of this saga with love, hate, happiness & battle and I can recommend it to all who love to read.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|The app worked fine till I moved it to sd card, after i moved it it fc's after the hourglass HTC G2, rooted - Cyan 7.3 stable
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I miss a lot of TV becasue I work at night. I order DVD's to catch up and its always nice to find a decent show that gets me hooked!! This is a great show!!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|It's been hard to find a series that stand up to Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. Hounded is a wonderful first book in a new series that's now on my auto-buy list.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game, very addicted to it and I've only had it a few hours. Runs great on my G2. Dont rate the game 1 star if you cant read that its incompatible. It isnt the game's fault you cant read.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|This works great in the samsung galaxy tab! Definitely with the download. It is missing alot of the extras (all of them I would say) but it's still a great game. 4 stars only because of the missing extras.
B00005NKKV|4.0|History claims that the main reason for this album was the fact that the title song of this album,originally rendered as an acoustic folk piece on S&G's debut set [[ASIN:B00160ANTG Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.]] and it was felt the song would actually go over better with an electric guitar ala the Byrds. So that's what they did and that's the version we all know. As it turns out they decided to stretch the idea over a good area of this album for what esentially ammounts to their \\"folk-rock\\" debut. Of course most of this material is far from rocking. Most of it is still highly somber and folkish with a few electric twists. Aside from the title track the main rock type songs here are of course the \\"other\\" hit \\"I Am A Rock\\",with lyrics both Paul & Art now find to be sophmoric and silly. And considering the naivity of the youth culture of the time it seems sort of appropriate to a degree. Darker,mildly electric folk-rock songs such as \\"Richard Cory\\" and \\"A Most Peculiar Man\\" explore the more internal tentions of the era and in these cases how it might bring a person to end it all. Other songs such as \\"Leaves That Are Green\\",\\"Blessed\\" and \\"April Will Come\\" actually are more straight folk numbers with some heavier arrangements and mild electric embellishments.<br /><br />  \\"We've Got A Groovey Thing Goin'\\" is a more soulful sort of rocker,probably with another lyric the pair now regret. Honestly even with a tune like this whenever a Fender Rhodes electric piano solo shows up a certain funkiness is to be expected. And in my case that's a great thing-it beefs the sound up and also forshadows Simon's earlier interest in R&B and how it would reflect on his later work as a solo musician. Though a folk duo on from the outset,beyond it's historical cultural impact this album also represents a certain influence to an important sector of today's pop music world-especially that quiet,fey subgenre of folk-rock now know as \\"twee pop\\" in some quarters. That's because at this point the pairs vocal style and method of guitar harmonizing is often far more spare and quiet than merely mello and even when expressing matters of joy there's a mildly haunted sound. So this is a strong album that encompassess many aspects of both the world of these two talents and the world as it unfolded around them.ome quarters.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loaded onto my phone and wifes phone (both Samsung Vibrant Galaxy S). Game works just fine.  Have been waiting a long time for this.  Thanks PopCap and Amazon!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|For fans of plants vs zombies, this is a great game.  A few issues which have been noted, graphics could be better, transition effects need to be sped up but overall works great.  Surprisingly play ability on a small screen is fine, but works great on a tablet like the Xoom!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have waited for this to be on the android. Im so happy! I recomend this game to people of all ages!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|On my rooted Evo it runs fantastic. On my stock Xoom it works but there is some odd graphics issues with logos and when you get a new plant it runs very slow. Graphics could be much better on a tablet. I would pay 3-5 US dollars for a Tablet optimized version in HD. 3 Stars till I see a Tablet version as well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I'd been playing Plants vs. Zombies for such a long time on Steam and fell in love with the game. When I heard that there was a mobile version coming to Android, I was happy but also concerned. I wondered just what they would have to sacrifice to bring it to the Android platform. Fears were removed as soon as I started the game. It's so faithful to the original version that I was blown away.     Beautiful visuals, sounds and the gameplay may even be easier with touch screens.     I see a lot of complaints about wifi only and I can understand that, especially with people being on faster mobile networks these days. Luckily I was at home when I downloaded it or would have had to wait. Who really wants to wait for zombies?     Good work, Popcap. I had a similar game installed but PvZ completely blew it away.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I give one star because:    1. It's a real letdown to hear so many raving about a game... that doesn't run on the Motorola Droid, which I've had less than a year and which essentially launched Android.    2. Size does matter, people. At 74MB, this is not feasible for internal memory. And I've never seen a \\"Move to SD\\" option on the Droid.    And, yes, I read the description (about not working on specific devices and about the megabyte size) before reviewing. I rate the product poorly because of these limitations/flaws, e.g. for not engineering the software to be compatible with more Android smartphones on launch day. Frankly, as a software engineer myself, I find this lacking and disappointing.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|Waste of time, get yourself a flip phone and become productive. Save money too! Thats what I did. No need to have another thing to upgrade every year, stick it to the man! Get a flip phone!
0375836675|1.0|[[ASIN:0375842209 The Book Thief]]    I am sorry I ordered this book and wasted my money.The author portrayed  the German People, including children, as evil, without manners or scruples. No German spouse,parent or child would have used that awful language. The Germans are a extremely polite people and yet the author chooses to degrade them in every way he can. Is this another HATE piece of writing?  My review of this book would be zero (0)
B0001WTVUW|3.0|Thought this was interesting. Good movie. Young history buffs will enjoy seeing the tensions and culture of Cold War Era USA.
B001E9641K|5.0|This is my favorite of the Ticket to Ride series, of the games I have (US,Europe,Nordic). It's a fantastic option for those who can't get 5 or so players on another game. The map and the way the routes are laid out are incredibly challenging, and call for a lot of strategy as you can totally screw someone's game up with 2-3 moves in specific places.    What I loved the most about it was just the fact that DoW decided to feature the Nordic countries. I've always loved Finland, but it never gets the publicity that some of the other countries do. Playing this map made me feel right at home with the different Finnish, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish towns. Kudos to DoW for this game. It's totally worth the purchase price!
B0025VLEM0|4.0|This review is not about the movie, its about the menu and features of the Blu-Ray.    Menu is nice and futuristic, but the \\"online features\\" are nothing more then adverts. Commentary is okay, but its hard to follow.
B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie's performance was very well done. I thought this was one of her best roles as far as showing her depth. I liked how the story reflected how people all have different parts, some clearly present and some repressed. I loved the flow of the ballet. I would like to learn how to dance like this. The workouts seemed repetitive, yet it seemed as if it would feel good to the body. Performing in front of an audience seems daunting. Natalie's repressed emotions came out with intensity only with herself. She struggled alone without real understanding. I loved the beautiful cake, I would like to make it and to eat it. Her relationship with her mother went from nurturing to controlling and you felt her underneath emotions want to release. Her letting go with her role on stage was awesome. The whole sequence was riveting. I loved how she made her ballet shoes and I loved her and the dark swans beauty, Natalie's and the other actress. The other actress showed her gusto with the air of deviousness. I loved they way she tucked into the cheeseburger and her sauciness with others.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|opened once the first time, but afterwards, started crashing after the burglars shows up. womp, womp. pls fix it soon!
B004SIP71M|3.0|The film definately shows Meryl Streep's rich acting. The movie was thought provoking. Projection can be so perplexing. I love Amy Adams and her sweetness in all the roles she takes on. I know this will be short. I think what I liked the most about the film, was how the pastor reached out to the little boy who felt so alone and seemingly hurt. Whether their was an agenda in play the kindness did feel tangible in Philip's acting.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Cant play on Droid after all the hype? Thats not right, Popcap! Ive waited forever for this game to come to Android.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|the game asks to type in name but android keyboard doesnt come up so I'm stuck on that screen. archos 70 internet tablet.  android 2.3
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Won't load on evo. Dowlnoads fine, long installation and booted once. Now iy won't load. I expected more from popcap, guss this version was just an afterthought.
0784011710|3.0|The story can sometimes feel overly packed, we the viewers sliding from the narrator, to Sophie's past, to her present, to her more distant experiences, to her sociopath husband. It's saving grace is Meryl Streep and the performance she gives, culminating in the beautiful, harrowing scene where she makes her 'decision'.  However, ultimately this movie still feels slumped by its messy script and very often (particularly at the start) it can almost feel as though it's a play we're watching, all the action contained to a few rooms, interspersed with flask-backs.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Loved it on the PC and the Android version is just as good.  My entire family plays it including the wife.  Prepare for the zombie apocalyptic future!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|wont load past an hourglass then crashes back to phone. was really looking forward to this game. hope dev updates...
B0052UZIFA|1.0|What a disapointment. Why not write good software that is a little smaller in size and works on a phone (Motorola Droid) that many people still use. Not too good folks.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This app works great in my motorola atrix.  It's a pretty fun game.  People that are giving the application one star because of region restriction should learn to read the description first.  It's clearly stated.
B004V6MWFU|4.0|I had a feeling Eddie might release a ukulele album one day, what with the acoustic direction of his solo career and previous ukulele efforts \\"Soon Forget\\" on Binaural, \\"Goodbye\\" on A Broke Down Melody, and \\"Can't Keep\\" from the Live at Benaroya Hall concert. Or maybe I was just hoping... whatever the case, here it is - 16 ukelele songs by Eddie Vedder, along with a 40-page booklet of lyrics and photos.     This is a brief album, clocking in at just over a half-hour, with the longest tune only 3:23 minutes long (most of them are in the 1-3 minute range). As on Benaroya, the familiar \\"Can't Keep\\" starts things off, and the hauntingly beautiful \\"Goodbye\\" makes a re-appearance as well, this time with a somewhat more lively feel. Eddie gets accompaniment from himself (overdubbing himself for a chorus effect) on \\"Satellite,\\" from a cello on \\"Longing to Belong,\\" from gently rolling waves on \\"Light Today,\\" from Glen Hansard (from the Dublin band, The Frames) who harmonizes on \\"Sleepless Nights, \\" and by Chan Marshall/Cat Power for another harmonizing accompaniment on \\"Tonight You Belong to Me.\\" Then there's the 38-second voiceless strumming \\"Waving Palms,\\" and the 8-second growled throwaway \\"Hey Fahkah.\\" The final tune is a whispered, gravelly, lullaby-like rendition of \\"Dream a Little Dream\\" that almost invokes Iron and Wine. The remaining 6 tunes are all simple, stripped-down ballads, with Eddie for the most part singing in a hushed baritone and occasional falsetto, along with the steady strummed rhythm of his ukulele. For me the standouts are the tunes where Eddie seems to really open up emotionally, often about love, relationships, connection, and loss -- the prevailing themes of this album -- like on \\"More Than You Know,\\" \\"Light Today,\\" \\"Satellite,\\" \\"Longing to Belong,\\" \\"You're True,\\" and \\"Goodbye.\\"     If you liked the soundtrack to Into the Wild, you'll probably appreciate this, but Ukelele Songs is even more bare-boned and the overall mood -- picture Eddie relaxingoutside a surf shack, swinging in a hammock with his uke, or serenading some woman outside her window at night, rather than fronting PJ on stage -- doesn't shift much from track to track. Overall, pretty chill to say the least, and there's a kind of tenderness that you don't often hear in Eddie's work with PJ. I'd be lying if I said I didn't wish the album was longer, or that there wasn't a bit more variety in terms of tempo or emotional tone (like maybe when PJ threw in an acoustic version of Lukin' on Benaroya?), but it's a nice little side project and collection of heart-felt tunes for Eddie, and it will be interesting to see him using this material to support his live tour this year. The music definitely seems more appropriate in your cassette deck (do people still have those?) on the way to a weekend getaway at the beach than on a sold-out concert stage.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Seriously, no Motorola Droid compatibility? Is PvZ compatible with the iPhone that was being sold in 12/09 when I bought my droid?  Developer blew it here.
B0000062S0|5.0|For anyone out there over 55, who understands what Led Zep is REALLY about, and who might have witnessed their act live onstage, you will cry tears of joy, when listening to this masterpiece.   I'm sure many younger folks will love it, but my review is aimed at old battle hardened codgers like myself, who pray at night for some new music that will take them to both a higher and lower place.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I played/finished  this game on my ipad and have been wondering when it would make its way to Android. just started playing on my HTC Inspire and it is kick ass!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|why is everyone whining.  This is a classic game, graphics are good, if you want great play your console.  It's free, chill out and find WiFi, and stop complaining.  just a great game
0143034901|5.0|An excellent book, I had a difficult time putting it down.  The imagination of the author is incredible, shown in the very beginning with the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, and grows into a remarkable mysterious detective story set in Barcelona just after the civil war years. The story revolves around the chosen book, the author, and why someone is destroying all of his books.  All of the characters are mysterious, and the reader comes to see different sides of them as the story progresses.  Danger is ever present, and one can envision the tension of the era, when people feared for their lives and trusted very few others. Love is woven into the intrigue, which also becomes complex.  The map at the end gives credence to the story and makes the reader want to include Barcelona on his \\"bucket list.\\"<br /><br />I am looking forward to a second reading as I prepare to lead a discussion of the book.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|the game would be wonderful if it wasn't going into a loading screen for 10-20 seconds four times a level.
B0034G4OUO|1.0|This movie was well below what I expected it to be.  Big, buff, great actor like the Roc...his talent and physicality were totally wasted on this film.  I've made it through about 40 minutes of the film and just had to turn it off.  I may finish watching it today.  Much of the beginning of the film covers the Roc walking around, with little to no dialog, shooting people then walking away. From the starting scene to about 30 minutes in, I think he says less than 10 words.    The action sequences are all over the place.  The storyline jumps around alot, and the movie just didn't flow like a typical action movie.  Worst movie ever!

B0052UZIFA|5.0|HTC Inspire 4G - This game runs great. I got it for free but it's worth the 3$. I've played PvZ on PC and console so now its great to be able to play it on the go.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Im reviewing this because I can actually run and play it (Im on the Droid 2). and since reviews are for the actual game, not that it can't run. I don't rate PC games bad because I can't run it on my PC.  the game is an amazing pop cap game with colorful graphics and addicting and simple gameplay. its just the same as the PC version, except the touch controls are great, making the game a bit more fun honestly. I'd say Popcap made a great mobile port of this game.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|I have enjoyed Lady Gaga's music since I first heard \\"Just Dance\\"-- clearly a dance record.  Since then, with all of her hits, she has proven to be more than just a dance queen. She is a pop music icon in the image of many artists including Madonna, Robyn, Cher, Blondie with bits and pieces of rock, techno, electronica and jazz in the mix. Her icon status is no accident. She clearly makes the effort to explore varied styles and subject matter with her music which gives this album Born This Way an ecclectic feel providing something for everyone.<br /><br />Let's break it down into different categories. For romantic there's Marry the Night a kind of valentine to NYC, Fashion of His Love with clothing as a metaphor for passion, Hair representing individual style, and You and I a  pure expression of devotion.<br /><br />We have anthems dedicated to personal pride and ambition: Born This Way, Highway Unicorn and The Edge of Glory. Her increasing boldness is evident with socially relevant tracks Government Hooker, Americano, and Bad Kids.<br /><br />Finally there's what I love most about her: songs reaching the edge of contraversy.  Judas and Scheisse. The latter which is basically a German curse word, is interesting considering the record label's censoring of curse words.  I was annoyed with the bleeping but I am not surprised after the word b**** bleeped out on The Fame Monster. Now we have to black out in liner notes as well as bleep out s*** and f***. Yeah I know I'm bleeping them out too cause I don't want my review withheld but why not release two versions, clean and explicit? Probably a budget issue. After all this release contains a decent amount of music, full lyrics, elaborate photography and even thicker paper for the booklet. I believe Gaga's Scheisse is a dig at that censoring she knew the label would employ. I really love the sound of that track too, its Lady Falco! Yeah!<br /><br />As far as Judas her catholic upbringing clearly is an influence. But why not pit Judas as the opposite of Jesus if one regards these individuals as men and categorizes contemporary men as one or the other. The same bible story is on her mind with Bloody Mary \\"When Pontius comes to kill the king...I'm ready for their stones.\\" So maybe she is ready to defend some modern day savior or she compares herself to Jesus, and sometimes feels like Judas. At this point with all her success I think she is entitled. Let some folks call it blasphemy--its simply freedom of speech.<br /><br />If we ignore the lyrics and focus just on her sound, there is quite an 80's influence but in a good way. She is not copying the metallic synth pop but rather borrowing jazz saxophone, electric guitar, and dance beats from that era and making it all an original Gaga creation. For me Electric Chapel was the most reminiscent of the 80's and kinda sounded like something Madonna would have released then.  And yes Born This Way is a little like Madge's Express Yourself in the chorus.  Of course the saxophone on Edge of Glory and Hair is by the great Clarence Clemons from the E Street Band which gives us a little Springsteen rock and You and I has elements of Queen's We Will Rock You. No matter how we define her sound, the music is infectious, the lyrics catchy and you will want to lather, rinse and repeat the experience over and over and over again.<br /><br />*******The Special Edition has the added bonus of the Country Road Version of Born This Way on disc 2. I love this version because the simplicity of the arrangement allow us to really listen to the lyrics. The rest of the second disc contains excellent dance remixes which we would expect from Gaga and is fun to listen to in the car for a short trip.esus if one regards these individuals as men and categorizes contemporary men as one or the other.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Ive been waiting for this game on Android since forever. Finally! Great Job...let's see how long it takes me to beat it :)
0425242099|5.0|If you're a Psy/Changeling fan like me you have been waiting for Hawke's own book for what seems like forever. Well, the wait is finally over because the tenth book in the series, Kiss of Snow, is out and it is definitely worth the wait. I'll go right out and say that I'm rating this book 5 out of 5 stars and a fair warning, this review will contain a lot of gushing. Fellow readers, this book is sooo good!! Seriously one of the best romances and the best paranormal romance I've read this year--it met all my high expectations and I wanted to re-read it again when I flipped the last page.<br /><br />Unlike most fans, I wasn't really a Hawke/Sienna shipper. Sienna did grow up a lot throughout the series but I didn't quite see her as heroine material for super sexy Hawke. But as I started reading Kiss of Snow I totally did a one-eighty and rooted for Hawke and Sienna. She turned out to be a fantastic heroine that stood on her own (which was hard to do with a bigger than life hero in Hawke). Sienna was strong, smart, confident and she didn't let the very dominant Hawke dominate over her. For half of the book, Hawke tried to resist Sienna because having already found and lost the woman who would've been his mate, he knew he was destined to be alone and couldn't give her what she deserved. But Sienna tried to prove him wrong and did all she could to drive him crazy. There was a lot of will they or won't they build up and while that might leave some readers frustrated, I enjoyed the playfulness between them all the while chemistry and tension crackled. Hawke and Sienna are my new favorite couple in the series next to Judd and Brenna.<br /><br />Besides Hawke and Sienna's story there was a secondary romance between Sienna's uncle Walker and Lara, the SnowDancer's healer that was very sweet and lovely. We also get to see a lot of Judd, Brenna, Lucas, Sascha, Indigo and many of the other characters we love and have come to care for in the series. The overarching storyline of growing tension between the Psy and the Changelings continued with a skirmish towards the end of the novel with some casualties on both sides, which gives us a taste of the inevitable full-out war to come. But despite these secondary plot lines, it was still very much a romance and still Hawke and Sienna's story. Ms. Singh could have easily let the Psy/Changeling war take over the main story but she didn't and that's what I loved about this series--it continues to be a true sigh-inducing romance (take note Ms. Ward, this is how a paranormal romance series is done). The world building was as excellent as always, at every book we learn a little bit more of the world and it doesn't change here.<br /><br />I most definitely recommend Kiss of Snow to everyone. However, if you are new to the series, you will not want to start with this book. To fully appreciate the characters, the world Ms. Singh has created and to avoid confusion to the few overarching storylines that build at every book in the series, you'll want to start with the first book in the series Slave to Sensation and read up to Kiss of Snow. Trust me, you'll want to read the whole series anyway. And even if you think you're \\"over\\" paranormal romances, Ms. Singh's Psy/Changeling series is one you will absolutely not want to miss.<br /><br />Reviewed by Michelle for Michelle & Leslie's Book Picks book blogetween the Psy and the Changelings continued with a skirmish towards the end of the novel with some casualties on both sides, which gives us a taste of the inevitable full-out war to come.

B00011D1OA|5.0|Dvd is in fabulous condition.  It's one I will be watching over and over again.  Thanks so much!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game. It is the ultimate productivity killer. I'm sure my boss is going to hate me for installing this. Keep up the good work popcap.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Gaming on Android may never catch up to iOS, but with the release of PvZ, I now consider the state of Android gaming to be &quot;good enough.&quot;
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this is third console/device I will have this on and love it more and more the more and more I play!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very good game. I've been waiting for this for months. Today is a beautiful day. I got it for free too, don't know why some people are saying they couldn't...
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|I like hearing her slow stuff. I think 'Pearl' is my favorite song on this CD. Def. worth a listen.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I have this game on the PC and was eagerly awaiting it's availability for Android.  But guess what?  It's not compatible with the original Motorola Droid(along with a handful of other devices)!  Excuse Me?  Really, PopCap, really.  My phone runs Android 2.2; the game's minimum requirements are 1.5.  So, why on freaking earth would you not make this game playable on the original Droid?
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I cannot believe they would not support the original DROID. I understand the whole business of cutting their customer service complaints by limiting it to stock devices that are newer, but come one... I am running a rooted DROID Original overclocked to 900MHz (it easily goes to 1.25GHz, but I get extra battery life from 900). I am running full gingerbread 2.3.4, when most of the phones out there are not; those that do have gingerbread are probably only running 2.3.3.     For everyone out there poking fun at people for having phones being old and outdated, I will gladly do the Pepsi challenge any day with my Old DROID versus your whatever. Those who say not to complain are obviously those who don't even come close to understanding how the Android OS works.     To the developer, set up spec requirements by OS. The older phones will never get 2.3.3, let alone 2.3.4, and that should weed out your issues with having to support older hardware. Also, don't let the whole root thing scare you, people with rooted phones are least likely to ask you about issues they are having. That is what the developer community at XDA is for. Look me up, TEK112.    I gave this app a good rating though, because it does run on my Viewsonic G-Tablet overclocked to 1.4GHz running Froyo 2.2. Go figure!    I'll step down from by box now.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|This App has been great, aside from the slight hiccups, it works much better then Slacker Radio did, plus I can listen to the local morning show.  My only problem now is I'm considering going from unlimited data, to 2GB cap at 4G Speeds, with unlimited at lower speeds.  So I was checking my usage and I jumped from 1.5-3GB's a month to over 5GB's a month with this app.  This is compared to when I streamed from Slacker.  I'd like to request an option be added that prevented the app from working over Cellular, a WiFi only check box.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|for the original Droid!?  way to screw us over.  Thanks for the tease though, please by me dinner for the next great incompatible game app.  I usually get dinner first ...

0061547832|4.0|He's got the TV show.  He's got the reputation.  He has \\"the hair.\\"  There is a plethora of reasons why people will not give this book a shot--many of those are the same reasons why, despite the interest, I didn't rush to buy the book.  In fact, my wife brought it home from the library for me.  Three days later, I was ranting and raving about this great book I'd read.    If you're looking for a sugar coated business success and how-to book, please, don't open the cover.  If you're looking for a kick in the ass, blunt, and very valuable reference, by all means get the book, start reading, and don't stop until the very end.  Trump has made a lot of money in his life, and he's been very successful in business. The advice he gives in this book is not for the average Joe who is okay with his mediocre job, mediocre pay, and mediocre life.  This is for those of us who want more--we want to succeed, we want to make it.    I would have given the book 5-stars for the advice alone if it weren't for two sections.  One, the pre-nup.  Yes, divorce rates are sickening.  However, you don't run a marriage as you would a business as the CEO.  If you do, it'll end up in divorce, as Donald has been well versed.  Two, the revenge factor.  I get it; I've been screwed by dear friends financially on more than one occasion.  However, I don't go out of my way to ruin them, to screw them harder than they screwed me--he'd refer to me as a weak loser in this regard, and I'm okay with that.  Aside from those gripes, AWESOME read, well worth the three sittings it took to get through.

Unfortunately, when I try to run it is goes INCREDIBLY slow (just through the menus...never got to the actual game) and I cannot back up or hit the HOME button without it freezing momentarily. When it does finally get to the HOME screen, my icons and widgets are not there, and I have to wait a minute before I can load my Apps list, and then exit back out for everything to run fine.     Hope they can update this bad boy to make it more efficient and functional. If they do, I'll change my review. Until then, 1 star. :(

0739321005|4.0|Obama lends his voice to take us along on a journey through his life. There's a reason why this won a Grammy for spoken word, as Obama embodies the characters in his book with the skill of an actor. My only qualm would be that the Audio Book is abridged and is not the entire \\"Dreams of My Father\\" book, so it would be good to supplement the CD with the book if you want the whole story.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|As a connoisseuse of marble-rolling games (or did I mean \\"addict\\"?), I love the Perplexus Epic. It's a big step beyond the original: many paths are curved in a way that makes them non-planar, and play necessarily involves a lot more acceleration and deceleration than the original. There are also at least two points where the ball has to drop through the air a significant distance, and there are many more moving parts. I'm especially charmed by the \\"gondola\\", a sliding structure that is used and re-used ingeniously.    There are some manufacturing inconsistencies, as others have said. My co-worker also has an Epic. On his Epic there is only one wall on the path at 18, where mine has two walls; he also claims that my see-saw works better. Having now played all the way through, I've found one flaw in the manufacturing of mine: after 114 but before the blue circular barrier, the blue tube passes too close to the gray track and the ball cannot continue. I've tried bumping the ball up and over this unintended barrier but without a lot of luck. There's also one especially soft spot in the transparent sphere.    The Epic provides three extra starting points along the path -- Practices A, B and C, which drop you into the path at 33, 56 and 91. Other practice points become available if you use a small magnet to bring the ball up and drop it onto the track. Points that are especially accessible this way include 24, 45, 49, 117, 63 (the steps), 104, 31, and 80. I definitely recommend this trick for repeated practice of specific parts of the track that are giving you trouble, or parts that are impassible due to a loose screw.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|works as intended for a while, then entire game freezes and force closes. seems to reset sd card as well, as phone needs to rescan after closing app. most likely a memory leak.

B0051QIGP4|1.0|Although a one time Gaga enthusiast, I am thoroughly disappointed by the new album... It somehow manages to be the usual \\"too much\\" and boring at the same time. It's not all bad, but I give it one star for the disappointment factor. It probably works for the very young generation, who is just discovering the magical and heady mix of symbols of art, sex and religion... Well hello guys, Madonna was there first - a long long time ago - built an impressive career on all that... I just don't see the interest of putting such frantic effort into producing something that is déjà vu and déjà heard...
B002ZG99IG|1.0|This could be the shortest review I've ever written. Why? Because this movie was so bad, so boring and has been done so many times in the past all I could think while watching was why make it again?<br /><br />Long story short the film is about a young woman named Sara (Minka Kelly) who arrives at the University of Los Angeles, goes out with friends to a party and meets a new guy. When she gets back she finds her roommate Rebecca (Leighton Meester) moved in. The two become friends as roommates do but Rebecca takes things a little too far.<br /><br />Okay she takes them way far. She's a stereotypical nutcase who obsesses way too much about Sara. She threatens anyone who she thinks is getting too close to her. She goes through her things. She attempts to prevent anyone from getting to near her. Sound familiar? If not then you probably never saw SINGLE WHITE FEMALE or even FATAL ATTRACTION. Both have psycho women who feel compelled to do damage to the ones their attracted to.<br /><br />The worst part of all is that with an attractive cast, all of which are accomplished actors, one would think they'd have a decent script to work with. Instead the film is boring with a capital B. Long drawn out sequences that lead nowhere, scenes that take far too long to pan out and so much filler in the whole film make this one seem like a half hour TV episode stretched out to 91 minutes. Even at that amount of time you feel like the movie takes forever.<br /><br />You've seen this before. You know how it's going to end. Even if you haven't seen the other movies that this film steals from (and poorly at that) you'll know what's going to happen before the final minutes roll. And that is the sign of a badly made film. A remake or a reworking of a story can be made so that its at least entertaining. This film offers nothing like entertainment. I would love to write a longer piece on this film but then why bother? It truly is an insult to movie goers.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|not sure what the other users problem was but on my lg it's working flawlessly. sure it take a while on the hourglass loading screen but after it loads it runs perfect, was thinking it would have lag cause of phone resource but it shows no problem.<br />glad the game is out for android finally so I don't have to take my DS to play.
B004EPYZOO|4.0|The craze for 3-D movies is still working its way to the big screen across the country. I've found it amusing at times but on the whole I could do away with the need to wear a second pair of glasses let alone the extra expense that a ticket for a 3-D film entails. Perhaps it was that expense that caused DRIVE ANGRY to not be the big hit it was expected to be. This is unfortunate because all in all it was a fun film.<br /><br />The films starts off with a bang as John Milton (Nicolas Cage) revs down the road in a muscle car intent on catching three bad guys in truck. He forces them to crash, shoots one's hand off, blasts the second and then threatens the third unless he gives him information. It seems that he is chasing a group of bad guys with one purpose: to save a baby they've kidnapped.<br /><br />As the story unfolds we finally discover that Cage was a very bad man in his own right who was killed and sent to Hell. He escaped when he witness his daughter's death at the hands of Jonah King (Billie Burke), a satanic cult leader who intends to sacrifice her child on the next full moon in the hopes of bringing Hell to Earth. Milton has set his sights on revenge and only the rescue of the child and death of King will suffice.<br /><br />As he sets out to track down King, Milton requires a new car having crashed the last one. A chance encounter with a young waitress named Piper (Amber Heard) leads to a ride down the road. When he saves her from an abusive boyfriend after she's been knocked unconscious, the pair head south for Florida via Louisiana. FL is her destination, LA his.<br /><br />Along the way the pair is being followed by two different people. The first is a man who refers to himself as \\"The Accountant\\" (William Fichtner). In actuality this is Hell's agent on Earth trying to track down and recollect Milton. Why he can't just pop in and out where he wants is never explained but like all Hell employed bounty hunters he just follows and kills along his way to catch the escapee.<br /><br />A run in with the followers of King leads to Piper and Milton being captured. As King speeds off with Piper and the baby having just shot Milton one would think the film would end. But keep in mind that Milton is already dead and a headshot won't be the sort of thing to stop him.<br /><br />The film rolls along with tons of car chases and mayhem, explosions and gunfight, until a final confrontation between Milton and King finally arrives.<br /><br />This is the stuff that drive-in movies were made of back in their heyday during the seventies: cars speeding down the highway, cults that just seem downright stupid, gun battles using guns that never seem to run out of ammo and a smattering of nudity here and there. As I watched I kept thinking of past films like VANISHING POINT and RACE WITH THE DEVIL, to classics of the genre.<br /><br />The film is filled with completely unbelievable items that you either accept as part of the universe it is set in or just shake your head asking how anyone could expect you to believe it at all. Perhaps the most extreme (and the raciest) is when Milton is in the middle of having sex only to leap up still attached and begin shooting bad guys left and right. Not only does this tell you how unbelievable the film is but also how it got the R rating it deserves as well.<br /><br />Cage does a great job as the determined tough guy out to take down those worse than him for a noble cause. Fichtner is amazing to watch as the smooth operating collector who feels no remorse taking out various bad guys or telling people he'll seem them soon, some in years others in months. And Heard plays the young woman sucked into a world she is completely unaware of only to feel the need to help Milton in his quest.<br /><br />Some will be offended by the whole sacrifice idea (used in tons of movies in the 60s and 70s before it became something to really fear), some will not be keen on the idea of a hero in the form of an escapee from Hell and others will be offended by the bloodshed and nudity. I mention these as a warning for those easily offended. For the rest who are just looking for 105 minutes of pure escapist fun then make sure you give this one a watch.these as a warning for those easily offended.

B004T0XYKK|4.0|Once again the movies of John Wayne are slowly making their way onto blu-ray format. Perhaps not the most famous of those films but ones that continued to show why even during his later years Wayne continued to make westerns that could entertain.<br /><br />RIO LOBO finds Wayne as Col. Cord McNally at the tail end of the Civil War. Waiting for a gold shipment he's disappointed when confederate soldiers led by Capt. Pierre Cardona (Jorge Rivero) drops a hornet's nest into the car containing the gold and soldiers and then cuts lose the train cars to steal the loot. A back and forth of who has whom results in Wayne capturing Cordona and his right hand man, Sgt. Tuscarora Phillips (Christopher Mitchum).<br /><br />The years pass, the war ends and prisoners are set free. McNally meets up with Cordona and Phillips in search of information. He wants to find who it was that set up the train heist, who it was on his side that was feeding the south information. One of McNally's friends was killed in the attack, a killing he doesn't hold against his war time foes but does against a traitor. The three part ways on good terms giving McNally a little to go on but enough that months later he heads to Rio Lobo in search of the traitor.<br /><br />On his way there he once again runs into Cordona. They also become acquainted with a young woman named Shasta (Jennifer O'Neill) fleeing Rio Lobo and hunted by three killers with badges. Needless to say they lose the ensuing gunfight and McNally discovers that not only has the traitor taken over the sheriff in Rio Lobo, he's about to put an end to Tuscarora and his family as well. The three set out for Rio Lobo to help and finally get the revenge that McNally sought to begin with.<br /><br />So this is a later John Wayne film and one that did decent at the box office but also showed a decline in movie goer's enjoyment of westerns and Wayne as well. Sure it did good business but not what his earlier films did. But that doesn't take away the fact that this is an enjoyable film that the entire family can watch. There are a few violent moments that small children might not need to see (a woman shows the results of a facial slice made by bad guy Mike Henry as Rio Lobo's sheriff for hire) but it's far less graphic than even some TV shows today.<br /><br />There is plenty of gun slinging and Wayne once more turns down the role of romantic lead, offering it to the younger Rivero instead. A smart move on his part as chances are ticket buyers would have had a hard time dealing with the older more mature Wayne hooking up with the much younger O'Neill.  There is more plot than usual for a western here between the civil war antics and the search for the traitor who sold out his fellow soldiers (played by Victor French long before his LITTLE HOUSE ON THE PRAIRIE days) but that just brings in more folks to help before the final gunfight.<br /><br />Of interest to some would be the casting of two individuals in the film. The first is a bad guy, the initial three who come looking for O'Neill played almost silently by George Plimpton. Plimpton was a writer known for his taking on jobs to find out what they were like first hand. His claim to fame was writing the book PAPER LION where the lean and tall Plimpton spent time as a Detroit Lion football players to see what it was like. Here, he takes on the role of a stunt man. The second would be Sherry Lansing as Amelita. Lansing worked as an actress for some time before moving behind the camera and becoming not just a producer but the head of Paramount Studios for some time.<br /><br />No, this is not John Wayne's best film nor would I consider it in the top ten. But it does offer a good western that you can kick back and enjoy. The blu-ray format does indeed help the quality of the picture and gives it that much newer feel and look. One can only hope that all of Wayne's films receive the same treatment down the line.film that the entire family can watch.

B003L77GH4|5.0|I read the series as a teenager back in the mid 1990's and fell in love with the trilogy then. When Twilight came out I thought it was such a rip off from this series. This show is incredible, yes the people are gorgeous but the acting the actress Nina is awesome, being able to play two different characters with such ease and believability. The actors they got for Stefan and Damon can I say are just absolutely GORGEOUS and HOT. This show is aweseom I can not wait for the release of the second second season and beginning of the third season. [[ASIN:B003L77GHE The Vampire Diaries: The Complete Second Season [Blu-ray]]]

0061726826|3.0|Great concept and writing, but Delirium did not move me like Lauren Oliver's first book, Before I Fall.<br /><br />Synopsis: Lena lives in a world where Love - also known as \\"amor deliria nervosa\\" - is a disease, the most deadly disease, for you suffer when you have it and when you don't.  In the world that Lauren Oliver has created, this disease has a cure.  Eighteen year olds are cured with a medical procedure, at which time they are given a suitable match.  Occasionally, the cure doesn't take, or a person rebels, and those people, and their sympathizers, are never heard from again.<br /><br />Just from reading the concept for this book, one can get a pretty good idea of what is about to happen to Lena and her world.<br /><br />\\"You can't truly be happy unless you're unhappy sometimes.\\"<br /><br />There were parts of Delirium I wanted to read out loud, highlight with a big yellow marker and quote it back and forth.  Lauren Oliver has a way with words, and the writing was great.<br /><br />Each chapter began with a quote from one of the guidebooks that the world of Delirium uses to educate their people.  Oliver's clever interpretations (or misinterpretations) of the major texts which many of us live by today - like the Bible - were ingenious.  I also found it extremely interesting that Romeo and Juliet had been turned into a \\"cautionary tale.\\"<br /><br />I wish I could judge this whole story on the last few chapters, because that's when Oliver's pace really picked up steam.  Up until then, the novel was a bit flat and predictable.  There were even parts that, while it is a dystopian society and we have to suspend our disbelief, were not realistic at all. I wasn't quite sure how every word and every step had to be so in-line with regulations, yet there was a rave on the other side of town on a pretty consistent basis.  I also had a hard time with the relationship between Lena and Hana, her best friend.  I didn't completely trust Hana, and that distrust didn't feel like it was an intentional part of the story.<br /><br />The last few chapters, and especially the end, were pitch-perfect, though.  The pace was fast, the dialogue felt natural, and the final few pages kept me on the edge of my seat.  The ending - OH THE ENDING - was strong enough to make me want to read the next book in this new trilogy.<br /><br />I went crazy for Lauren Oliver's debut, Before I Fall, but this one didn't have the same heartbeat for me from start to finish.  I do love the way this author's mind works, and I enjoy her writing, so even though I didn't love this book, I'm still looking forward to the next book.<br /><br />Pandemonium (Delirium Book #2) by Lauren Oliver  is expected February 2012 from Harper Teen.ory.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|After reading Providence by Jamie Mcguire i came across this book wanting to inhale more books this this author. And inhale i did. I couldnt put this book down. Let me start by saying that this book is completely different from the Providence series. There are no supernatural elements in this book. I fell completely and totally in love with the characters. Abby is a strong character and you are rooting for her the whole time. Travis is a great buckwild hot mess of a bad boy. The dialogue is fun, super witty, the romance is on fire and the drama is heart wrenching. I wish there was more of an epilogue or another book because i did not want it to end. I want to know more!     The only problem that i had with this story is what i like the call the \\"twilight syndrome\\". Guy completely obsessed with girl. Girl rationalizes psycho behavior is ok because he loves her so. Hello red flags! Anytime someone needs the other to breathe its never a good thing. But with that said you are completely rooting for these two throughout the book.   I defintely recommend this book and i can't wait for more from this author
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have no idea what method of operation Amazon's deal is but the wifi only dl is stupid! So unlike the other peeps who can't play the game on their tablets, any Samsung Galaxy Tab owners (7in model)  can breathe and sigh of relief... it will play on the G Tab with some issues with sound play back.  I have no idea what that's about.  The game play is smooth, no pixeliation and it did take about 30 seconds to load.  The Zombies were kinda clouded...?  But the rest of the graphics were clear.  Dec the game is going to need some tweaking.<br /><br />My main gripe... the dl on wifi took like 40 mins!  Wtheck!?!  Right now Amazon you are pissing me off to the third degree! And the Zombie icing on the garden... lol... it will not dl at all to my phone!  (I have a Samsung Galaxy S Vibrant 3G)  This phone is neither lacking in processing power or memory. It plays Chuzzle exceptionally well.  The error message was saying problem with dl.  It is the same wifi I used to dl to my tab!!!<br /><br />This is unacceptable from you Amazon!  I said it before in other post... there is NO REASON TO MAKE PEOPLE DL SUCH A SMALL GAME THROUGH WIFI!!! NONE!  I have downloaded much bigger files (yeah... for you peeps with low memory phones... this file is about 75 mb) on my 3G network with no problems!<br /><br />So, I'm real sorry for putting you other dlers through my tiraid but this dl issue is getting freaking ridiculous!<br /><br />The game is a great PopCap classic and should have been released on the REAL Android Market... no mb caps and no restrictions to wifi. That should be a personal choice, not a requirement!!!<br /><br />If you were able to get the game for free today,  I warn you,  you will be addicted. At least the misery caused by Amazon will be offset by being able to kill something. Smdh... Amazon will surely push THAT button.<br /><br />Whoo sah y'all!

Not only it was open, indicating that it was not new, but the disks inside were blank. No printing on them whatsoever. One side solid silver, the other solid purple. Obviously my 3D bluray player got an error and eject the disks (i tried both sides, just to be sure).   Now I paid more than 20 US dollars to send it back to get a refund of less than 40.   Wasn`t expecting something like this when I bought a item that was supposed to be new.

It turns out he's a genuinely lovely guy who just wanted to play the blues. A fast moving, never ending adventure. It's historical, hysterical and philosophical, but also includes juicy gossip, guitar lessons and recipes. Whenever I'd reached the best part of the book, I'd turn the page and was rewarded with yet another amazing story to top previous ones. Halfway through I bought about ten more copies to give to family and friends. If you grew up anywhere near the 60's or have ever heard of the Rolling Stones, you're gonna love this book.

0896760839|5.0|If you are looking for both information and historic patterns the Janet Arnold books are very good. We actually created costumes based on patterns from her books in one of my costume classes in grad school. The one thing we discovered is that the sizes are based on body types from those periods which were much different from today (we tend to be bigger boned these days) so we had to resize the patterns but they turned out very well and the information she provides with detailed images is excellent! I have used this for making costumes and in writing papers and articles.
0061726826|4.0|The storyline of Delirium isn't particularly unique or new. What makes Delirium a good book and perhaps superior to the books in its genre is Lauren Oliver. She's an excellent writer who can essentially paint with words. She's able to capture what would otherwise be sappy sentimentality and create the kind of beauty that can break your heart. Great read and I'm excited to see what the rest of this trilogy (or series?) will be like!

B003MC5N28|5.0|What a great book. The Giver is a very serious book but also a book that youngish readers shuold be able to understand. This is one of those books that kids can begin to learn critical thinking from. It puts moral weight behind such mundane things that we take for granted. The book has you asking yourself questions like,\\"Is it okay to be pain free? Would you want a protected, colorless life if it meant safety and well-being. What things are worth dying for- freedom, oppurtunity, or even basic chioces?\\" I wish I had read this in junior high but better late then never.
B000PDYVVG|2.0|I read this book, anticipating that it was going to be great since it was being made into a movie. Wow, was I wrong. The book started out fairly decent, but drug on and on throughout the entire thing. It took me so long to read this book, I just couldn't get into it. It couldn't keep me interested. The majority of the chapters were so boring, that I was only reading 1 chapter a day. I actually quit reading it all together about half-way through, but forced myself to finish it right before the movie came out. I wouldn't recommend this book. It doesn't have a good flow to it, and it drags on in many parts. I know the book was intentionally written soley about her, but it was pretty boring to hear her talk only of herself and her issues. A little more diversity would have been more entertaining. I do have to say that her description of her travels, and the areas that she visits, was actually pretty nice. I could really envision her surroundings. But, that had to be the only thing about the book I liked. It just seemed like a waste of my time, reading this book, when I could have been reading something else more exciting and interesting.
1591391105|4.0|As I write this, I'm two weeks away from starting a new CFO job at an emerging medical practice, following 13 years at the director level in a private medical group, and 13 at the Controllership level in hospitals. This transition is a critical one, in that leveraging the past career experiences has landed me at a pinnacle of sorts. Thus it's important to be able to hi the ground running.<br /><br />Throughout the book, I reflected on how Watkins' approach might have best served me in previous leadership roles; moreover it helped me identify the kind of leader I did not want to become, as many of the \\"don'ts\\" looked all too familiar in the form of a recently installed new leader I'd worked with. Beyond trying to mold the kind of leader I did want to be, Watkins balances those cautions of what things to avoid doing in the critical acclimation phase.<br /><br />Interestingly, Watkins uses some frightening statistics to show how few companies (large and small) have formal indooctrination programs to help new managers & leaders assimilate to the organizations' culture, identify current leaders and form an understanding of its processes and politics. Most are highly Darwinian \\"sink or swim\\" environments. Perhaps this should be essential CEO/HR reading ?
1594202842|4.0|I come from a long line of farmers, hard-working, western folk, with pioneer blood.  Everything came from the sweat of their brow.  My father, is the last of that breed, the last farmer in generations of tradition.    Being raised with back breaking work, that was expected, not asked, I learned to work hard.  Now I have my own children, we live in the middle of town, in a small house, on a small lot, sometimes, I worry that my kids are going to miss out on the lessons of hard work that came so naturally in the environment I was raised.  That proved useful when I went to college (and in the work place).      I may not agree with everything that the author addressed, but I understand the battle, I understand the desire to teach the next generation to value what has proved successful in generations past and to add to that heritage the best they can.    I laughed out-loud in parts, I got teary in others, I was refreshed with how honest of her faults (and her strong-points) she was and I felt like some of it had a good level of satire to boot.      Her writing was so easy to read, I loved the *written as one would actually speak it* approach, it made it fun to read.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|This app is great fun.  Very colorful and impressive; it definitely improves on the original Angry Birds. I would absolutely recommend it.
0891419063|5.0|I have not served in the military, and so must learn about the experience the easy way, by reading. I've read a number of narratives of combat in the Pacific during WWII, and in my opinion this is by far the best of them. Some other reviews have commented that this book is \\"too long ... repetitive ... lacks literary merit\\". I also found the book repetitive in places, and it could have used a bit of editing in this regard. However, I absolutely disagree that it is too long or lacks literary merit. A book can be highly polished in the literary sense, yet fail to convey impressions and emotions effectively. This book is very competently written overall and succeeds superbly in conveying the exhaustion, fear, misery, horror, and sometimes humor of combat. In some cases, the repetitiveness in the book reinforces as a perhaps unintended literary mechanism the repetitiveness and tedium of the battles Sledge describes. What also come across very well are 1) the personalities of the Marines Sledge served with, showing the best and the worst of human behavior under stress, and 2) the command structure of the Marines, the esprit de corps, and the necessity of obeying orders without question (usually). Surprisingly, Sledge comments in several places on his and other Marines' respect for the abilities of the Japanese enemy as soldiers, despite absolute loathing of them. Finally, in several places, Sledge remarks on the utter senselessness of war and chastises politicians and diplomats for failing to prevent it. In this sense, it is a powerful anti-war book and is recommended reading for all national leaders who have not served in the armed forces yet have the power to send others into combat (or prevent the same). This is one of the most memorable books I've ever read: it is one of those rare books that changes the reader. In addition, it is a superbly good read; I couldn't put it down. I'd give it 10 stars, if this rating existed.
B002Z7FWBI|5.0|Package arrived promptly and in excellent condition. This item was an excellent choice for a dyed-in-the-wool Clint Eastwood/Dirty Harry freak! A nice addition to our collection of Clint Eastwood films.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|95+% of the 3 stars and below have a tablet, and the description specifically says NOT OPTIMIZED FOR TABLET, and that it should work, NOT WILL WORK. Its a great game if you love tower defense types, which I do. Please READ before you give an app a bad rating based on what it already describes. Runs great on Captivate w/serendipity. Size is bigger than I wanted, but for an awesome free game, it's definitely worth it.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Loved this movie.   The acting was great.  These actors were top notch, especially the girl that was the lead actress.   I thought about this movie the next morning.  It was that haunting.  I have never seen the first one so I don't have any reference to if it was the same as the remake.  I just enjoyed this movie.  It definitely kept my interest.
B000SEFNMS|3.0|Not a bad book, however, I didn't understand why the author went on a tangent about his own climbing ordeals in the past. I'm sure it was to relate to the subject's story in some similar point. Hard to understand why intelligent people have the need to put themselves through life altering situations like this. I wonder if they're so bored with life that they need another way to challenge themselves. Seems like some people are too smart for their own good.<br /><br />I can relate to the young man's strugles with his parents though. Seems like no matter what he did, it just wasn't good enough.
B0000AUHQT|2.0|This adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel was one of the most hyped star vehicles of the 1970s: it features an all-star cast, with Mia Farrow as Daisy Buchanan, Bruce Dern as her husband Tom, Karen Black as Myrtle Wilson, and Robert Redford in the title role. The adaptation is almost as faithful as imaginable to the original's language as possible, with most of the dialogue actually lifted from the book; even so it misses pretty wide of the mark in terms of recapturing its spirit. Part of the problem is the casting. The film was hyped on its star power, and so long languorous shots are given of Robert Redford and Mia Farrow (always in soft focus) snuggling on a lawn with swans in the water before them, or dancing by candlelight in Gatsby's empty mansion; the two don't have that much chemistry, however, and neither of them are flattered much by the camerawork. (Redford always looks profoundly dinky compared to his Nick Carraway, Sam Waterston, and Farrow's bob and kohl-rimmed eyes make her forehead look enormous.)     Farrow might have seemed like a good idea for Daisy, given her marked ability to seem annoyingly artificial and insincere; but by this point in her career she was overacting quite a bit, and thus was more usually seen to her best advantage in horror films, where her screaming and mugging didn't seem quite so jarring. Karen Black also chews up the scenery something awful as Myrtle; while Redford seems more of a pretty blob than anything. And Bruce Dern doesn't seem at all like a wealthy Yale athlete. While Waterston and Lois Chiles provide a serviceable Nick Carraway and Jordan Baker, only Scott Wilson really makes a strong impression as Myrtle's tragic husband George. The director, Jack Clayton, and his cinematographer, Douglas Slocombe, seem to be as much in love with fine things as Gatsby is: they reserve the vaseline filters and loving close-ups for the silver services and fine London shirts as much as they do for Redford's and Farrow's faces. Though the costumes by Theoni V. Aldredge and the music by Nelson Riddle both won Academy Aards, they both seem hugely misjudged: even Aldredge's casual outfits for Jordan Baker and Daisy Buchanan are ridiculously over-the-top (because Farrow was pregnant during the filming, she's also swathed in batwing sleeves and flowing scarves and capes), while Riddle provides annoying musical stings every time the camera zooms in on Daisy's anguished face or those heavyhandedly symbolic eyeglasses of Dr. T. J. Eckleburg. There are a few very pleasurable moments, such as a nice interior shot of Gatsby's mansion when his party guests pour in during a sudden rainstorm; and of course it's always a pleasure to hear Fitzgerald's dialogue. But there has still yet to be even a truly passable film adaptation of the original novel.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|It's pretty sad that with the HD version available on the iPad for about a year, they couldn't get the Android version out the door with tablet-optimized graphics.    I noticed one other major bug in my first few minutes of testing: I completed the first level, and when picking up the Sunflower packet, the animation slowed to a crawl. When the next level started, suddenly things were back to normal. An odd glitch for a Tegra 2 device with 1GB of RAM, which should have plenty of power for this game, especially when it's not pushing full-resolution graphics.
B00026L7O0|1.0|Hannibal, 2001 film    The movie begins with the questioning of a man about Hannibal Lecter. What does it mean? Next we see a woman sleeping in a truck. Special Agent Starling is in charge of this raid. There is a lot of shooting and action to grab your attention. Will there be some criticisms of her actions? Good judgment? [Isn't this all too dramatic?] Starling goes to Asheville NC to listen to Mason Verger, a survivor of Hannibal (disfigured for more drama?). [More sick sensationalism?] Starling reviews some shocking video (more sensationalism). She talks to Barney to get more information. [The movie starts to drag with these flashbacks.] There is a discussion at a university. Dr. Fell replaces a missing professor. Starling gets a letter that mocks her. The FBI analyzes that letter. In Italy a detective's curiosity causes a search of the \\"Most Wanted\\" list.    What is the point of Krendler's behavior. We see scenes of Florence. That Italian detective has a plan to get a fingerprint. Another over-dramatic scene? Not like when they feed the wild pigs! [Anybody recognize that opera?] Starling sees the videotape. Fell has a surprise for Pazzi. \\"Hello Clarisse.\\" Then another shocking scene! The scene shifts to the USA. A found note incriminates Clarisse; she is suspended. Will she be in danger now? [Can you believe these events?] Does the story drag again? Who is following her? There is dramatic action on the street. Clarisse sees it and reports it. A visitor is brought to Mason Verger. \\"Dinner at eight.\\" Clarisse arrives in time. The pigs go wild, but Clarisse is rescued by an unlikely person. [The story drags again.] There is a surprise for Krendler! What is on the menu tonight? Tastes good? Does Krendler have a lot of brains? Will those police cars arrive in time? \\"This will really hurt.\\" Fireworks in the night?    Hannibal has more lives than a wily coyote. But this terrible and horrible movie may have killed off the series. Can it get any worse? Too bad they couldn't write a better story. But how can they make a better story about a serial killer? Is there a message in showing the super-rich hiring criminals to do what lawyers can't do? Is there some opera where most of the characters die at the end? This is basically a vampire movie. All vampires are serial killers, and shown to be super-human in mind and body (until the last scenes). The sickness in this movie is how they present the murder of a cripple as a beneficial act! Is this movie as nice as Shakespeare's \\"Titus Andronicus\\"?
B004IQMXD4|2.0|The cd is so-so. I liked her last cd, Trouble in Shangri-la, better. It had some gems such as Candlebright, Sorcerer, Bombay Sapphires, and Fall From Grace. The one great song on this cd is Soldier's Angel in which Lindsey sings chorus. Unfortunately, I can't name any other songs on this cd that I really liked. I would suggest for her to rock a little on future recordings. I am a die hard Stevie fan, and I will continue to buy anything that she releases.
B003JTHESA|4.0|Well, the last few releases since the \\"reunion\\" have been sorta lackluster and sometimes...boring!  Dont get me wrong Brave New world had some choice cuts and Dance had Wildest Dreams and Rainmaker.The Life and Death album had one song I liked.. Reincarnation of Benjamin Bragg..overall most of those albums were flat and I hate to say boring. When I heard they were going to release a new record I thought I'll buy it cuz its Maiden, but wasnt expecting much! I had heard El Dorado on my XM radio and thought whoa that sounds good! So I got the disc and gave it a good half a dozen listens before passing judgement..the verdict was finally a solid Maiden record from start almost to finish! While I still miss Martin Birch's production, Kevin Shirley did a respectable job, my only fault is why is the bass sound so buried.. that is really my only gripe and thats saying alot cuz I was disappointed in the last 3 albums. This one is different...Satellite 15 starts the into to The Final Frontier, which gets the record started in the right direction. El Dorado(album fave)is an ass kickin return to the Maiden of old, and that leads into the other rocker Mothers of Mercy. Coming home tones it down some but still keeps you hooked with its harmonies. The Alchemist is a nice rocker. The Isle of Avalon(a personal fave) and Starblind are a bit more progressive but still rock nicely. The Talisman is a decent song not a fave but I wont complain. The last 2...The man who would be king and Where the wild wind blows clock in at close to 20 minutes. They are both epics on the line of Rime or Alexander the great, with their long story lines and many musical time changes. I prefer Where the wild wind blows of the 2 but only by a hair. I do agree with some of the other reviewers in that many of the solos are cleaner and there are more of them. Thats a good and welcome change indeed! This Maiden fan is quite happy with this record and I say get this and you wont be unhappy...sit back and enjoy...its about time boys!!
B004A8ZX2S|5.0|Last night my wife Kathleen and I were in the Los Angeles audience at a sold-out performance of Terrence Malick's new film, \\"THE TREE OF LIFE.\\" Crammed into the front row so we had to crane our necks at the enormous screen, I can nevertheless safely say that this movie far exceeded my expectations.     This is a film of staggering genius that ranks with other life-defining encounters I've had with great art. It's a work for the ages that will take its place alongside Beethoven's Seventh, Mozart's 40th, Shakespeare's \\"HAMLET,\\"  T.S. Eliot's \\"FOUR QUARTETS,\\" Dostoyevsky's \\"THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV,\\" Tolstoy's \\"WAR AND PEACE,\\" Melville's \\"MOBY DICK,\\" Leonardo da Vinci's \\"VIRGIN ON THE ROCKS,\\" Victor Hugo's \\"LES MISERABLES,\\" William Faulkner's \\"THE SOUND AND THE FURY,\\" Picasso's \\"GUERNICA,\\" Rodin's \\"THE LOVERS,\\" Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, Andrei Tarkovsky's \\"STALKER,\\" and Stanley Kubrick's \\"2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY\\". (It's significant that Douglas Trumball, who created the mindbending special effects for \\"2001\\" was a technical advisor for this film's special effects team.)     Malick plumbs the mind of God to bring us glimpses of the universe's genesis--indeed, he shows us the moment when God whispered \\"Let There Be Light\\"--while also taking us to the end of days, where all of us will be reunited with our lost loved ones in our Father's house of many mansions. Don't look for a conventional plot. The \\"plot\\" is life itself.    Malick evokes cosmic scale by refracting his tale through the prism of one humble, dysfunctional family in Waco, Texas, where Malick himself grew up. I don't know how much of this film is autobiographical. I can say that the 1950s Texas he grew up in looked, in this film, very much like the Waycross, Georgia I grew up in. But never before have I seen a film that so effectively captures a child's birth, growth, and fall from innocence. Never mind that Brad Pitt turns in a stellar performance as the child's bitter, frustrated father. The actors--indeed, all the spoken lines and events--are incidental to the imagistic theme: that we are moving in a repeating pattern of birth, innocence, fall from innocence, decline, death, rebirth and salvation, down through the ages, and time will one day end when God's plan has been fulfilled.     Malick's cinematographer achieves his breathtaking effects by showing people moving in graceful, swirling arcs, much as Kubrick's cinematographer did in the space shuttle sequence in \\"2001\\". The camera is always moving, and the movement captured is the dance of life. Curiously, in this film dominated by spellbinding images, a searingly memorable line of dialog comes from the child's mother near the film's end: \\"You must live with love. If you don't love, your life will pass in a flash.\\" The subtext is clear: love is the point--the alpha and omega--of the universe and its seemingly chaotic rush toward dissolution. And in the end, there is only the Light, as it was in the beginning.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|I saw the original TRON in the theater at age 12.  Loved it then, and more impressed with it now.  The Blu ray is an incredible remastering of the movie.  The story is so ahead of its time.  I just wish Disney had released it before the sequel.  I remember a review of TRON Legacy that said it was \\"the Matrix on steroids.\\"  Obviously the film critic hadn't seen the original TRON from which the Matrix borrowed many of its ideas.  The Matrix, in fact, is the original TRON on steroids.
0316056863|3.0|Oh Tina Fey, you are so funny.  The book though...the book has its moments.  As noted in the many other reviews, this is a thin little book.  Half memoir, half treatise on comedy, it never really hits its stride on either front.<br /><br />The best moments in the book probably come in the first half as she describes her childhood and eventually her college years and years in Second City.  Fey is great at self depreciating humor, often poking fun at her general dorkiness, woeful fashion sense (described along with the same sort of painful pictures we all have) and lack of a love life.  These sections have that perfect quality of information/joke/information/joke.  Another later section on her disasterous honeymoon is equally hilarious.<br /><br />After she makes it to SNL though, it starts going down hill.  It begins in the Second City section and continues to ramp up throughout the book.  One of the constant themes of the book is how unfairly women comedians are treated at SNL and elsewhere.  In her defense, it is likely true.  Regardless, I got it early and was bored by it.<br /><br />I'm sure Fey has received her share of sexism, but she also makes $13 million a year and has seven Emmys, it isn't like people aren't taking her seriously as a talent.  Instead, people seem to admire her for being effortlessly attractive, effortlessly funny and one of the smartest people in the room.<br /><br />The book is also padded out to a sellable length by odd sections.  The oddest section was her giving her writing staff at 30 Rock credit for some of the jokes.  She would put in a short description of each writer and then their \\"MVP joke\\" from scripts.  In another section she reproduces the entire script of her first Sarah Palin sketch on SNL.<br /><br />It is hard not to like Tina Fey if only because her comedy has been consistantly brilliant and has only improved over time.  But sadly, this is just not a great book.  Its not a terrible book by any stretch, but it is just funny enough to keep you reading, not great enough to keep you enthralled.eat enough to keep you enthralled.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Would be nice to have the option of downloading this without WIFI.  I have a 4G LTE phone and unlimited download, but where I live the best broadband I can get is Satellite which is way SLOWER and has daily download caps.  These apps that will ONLY download over WIFI drive me crazy, especially when 4G exists!
0345529057|5.0|The print is too small for older folk like me. But I was unable to make out the maps on my Kindle. And I also wanted to quickly gain access to appendix material on the various houses of the Seven Kingdoms. So, I see this reasonably priced bundle as a useful reference for geriatric readers fond of the Kindle's large font who want quick access to the maps and the heritage guides at the end of the books. I expect my 13 year-old son will be able to squint his way through the four installments when the time is ripe (we currently watch the HBO miniseries together, though I occasionally invoke the \\"close-your-eyes\\" ritual).    As to Martin's masterpiece. I would describe the reading experience as basking in the presence of greatness. Even so, readers should be forewarned that \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" is far from complete after \\"A Feast for Crows.\\" Indeed, I have some doubts that this song will be finished during my lifetime--or even during Martin's. This is not a story about closure; it is story about open-ended rapture.
1594202842|3.0|this book was entertaining if for no other reason than the woman who wrote it is a maniac!  my mom was very strict with me (and we are westerners so there is no truth to her claims re east vs west) but this lady is out of control.  this is the kind of self-absorbed woman who ends up wondering how in the world her children could end up getting in all kinds of trouble later in life and even doing things like committing suicide. She decries westerners while taking advantage of all the west has to offer. And I am surprised she doesn't have the dogs in constant dog shows (with punishment if not #1!) or at least washing dishes and scrubbing floors. I wish her well but wouldn't be surprised if, when grown, one or both of her kids knock her on her butt.  Oh, and her husband needs to grow a spine!  He seems to be a complete non-entity unless money is needed for anything.  And while I don't agree with a lot of what westerners practice with their kids, this is way too far the other way.  This is NOT a happy family, unless happiness is judged solely on the whims of the mother.
B004Q1FDHO|3.0|Super Dynamite Fishing is a very fun, addictive game, but it has a lot of glitches and a few gameplay elements that need to be improved.      As many others have mentioned, this game has a tendency to lock up your phone. On more than one occasion my phone completely rebooted itself while I was playing.  Another problem that I noticed was that some things changed if I had to pause to check a text message or answer a call.  For example, one day I sold all my guns and bought all dynamite to complete a fishing challenge.  A few minutes later I had to close the app, and when I reopened it I found I had several guns again.  I also had a problem with the Achievements screen.  I could view everything else in the game as far as the newspaper, missions, history, etc...but whenever I tried to look at my achievements, the screen would become a scrambled mess.  I tried this several times and never could get the screen to load right.  One other small glitch that I noticed was that for some reason, it always said \\"New\\" next to one of the levels even after I had unlocked several others.      As far as the gameplay is concerned, there were a few minor annoyances.  For one thing, killing the birds is a real waste of time.  You don't get money for killing birds, but on rare occasions they will steal some of your fish.  I saw this happen maybe 3 times.  However,one of the most common challenges requires you to kill a certain number of birds.  When you have to worry about shooting 50 birds, it gets hard to also kill enough fish in the time allotted, but you still don't get any money for the birds that you kill other than the challenge money.  In other words, if you complete a fish challenge, you get money for the challenge AND for all 50 fish you kill. Because the challenges make up the largest portion of your profits each day, completing a bird challenge means you're going to end up with less money, which gets frustrating when your bills start getting more expensive to pay.      Moneywas a big issue I had with this game. Each time you unlock a new fishing area, your daily bills get more expensive. In return, the value of each daily challenge increases.  When you unlock the ocean areas, the fish there are generally more valuable than the ones in the river and pond that you start with.  However, the game randomly chooses where your challenges will be, which means you end up spending a lot of time catching less valuable fish despite having more expensive bills. Meanwhile, the fish get harder to kill and require more expensive weapons while the items you have to buy for your girlfriend also get more expensive.      The boats were another issue I had.  You can quickly upgrade to a military battleship that costs $26,000.  This boat holds 100 fish at a time, but it is extremely hard to stop and change directions.  Many of the later challenges require you to catch 50 of one certain fish, which means you're going to either waste all day trying to wait on chances to kill only that fish, or you're going to fill up your boat before you get to 50.  The problem here is that there is only one more boat you can upgrade to, and it costs $100,000.  By this point in the game, I was paying $3,750 a day in bills and only making a profit of about $3,000 a day, some of which had to go back into weapons.  To be able to make $100,000, one would have to play for a long time without buying gifts for the girlfriend, which is the whole point of the game in the first place.  Basically all I'm saying is that they either need to increase the value of the fish as you progress in the game, or they need to come up with a few more boat upgrades.  Jumping from a mediocre $26,000 boat to a perfect $100,000 boat without any steps between is too big a leap to have to make.      I enjoyed playing this game for a couple of days, but once I completed the main objective (buying your girlfriend enough stuff that she'll move in with you) I didn't really see any reason to keep playing.
1416596097|2.0|I've read almost all of this author's books and got some enjoyment from this--his abilities, even at fifty percent, are still there. But its politically correct ode to Islam and ridiculous anti-American ending just seem shabby.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The android version is just as good as the apple products version. The download and install did take forever though.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Considering Droid users are barely reaching their 18 month contract right now, it would have been a nice gesture to tweak the game to allow them to use it. considering this is NOT a new game, but simply a port, i dont see why the og droid is not able to run it.
B004XOGLBQ|5.0|I'm not a Pearl Jam fan. That may have to change after listening the this album.  I am an ukulele fan and player.  When I saw this getting a mention on Morning Express this morning, I took a look a the description and immediately downloaded it.  And I'm very impressed.  Eddie Vedder has a great voice and it matched with the ukulele very well.  It is not easy to get seriousness and a touch of sadness with the bright sounds of the instrument, but he managed to bring it together in a nice folk tune way.  This music would fit with any folk song collection and is certainly helping promote the ukulele in a big way!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|awesome game. been playing it for a loooong time. stop rating the game based on your old android version. the game is great your phone sucks.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Samsung Captivate - This is an excellent game...fun, different, and above and beyond many of the games out there for Android.  It seems lots of people like to rate apps and games for things like:<br /><br />\\"Says it is not compatible with my phone\\" &lt;~~What did you miss here?  The description said it would not work with your phone...why give 1 star for something you never used?<br /><br />Ignore many of the 1 Star reviews...people missed the boat on how to review an app or game...you should actual rate something you USE.  Whether or not you COULD use it is an entirely different matter.  It's like saying...\\"my neighbor has a Porsche...it's too slow because he won't let me drive it\\"  WHAT!?!?<br /><br />Try the game...if for any other reason...IT WAS FREE TODAY!  05/31/2011

B004V6MWFU|5.0|Eddie Vedder makes beautiful music with the ukulele. I never though someone with rock roots could make such great music with this instrument, but Eddie pulls it off.  My favorite track is \\"Waving Palms\\".  This is a lovely thirty-seven second instrumental.  This music is so peaceful.  It is truly the music palm trees could make if they could.  Eddie has magic fingers on the track \\"Can't Keep\\". This is one upbeat song that breaks the idea that all ukulele songs are performed slowly.  I love this song very much.  My other favorite is \\"Tonight You Belong To Me\\". This tune is sweet and romantic.  Eddie plays the chords of this sons so well.  \\"Light Today\\" is a track that includes the gentle sounds of waves on the beach in the background.  This track sounds so calming.  \\"Sleepless Nights\\" is a song about longing for loved one.  Eddie's vocals are so heart felt on this song.  This song is very pretty.  \\"You're True\\" is an upbeat love song with strong visual imagery of water falls and a full moon.  This song is a fun three and a half minutes.  \\"Sleeping By Myself\\" is a song about brooding in loneliness.  This is a gorgeous sounding song despite the subject matter.  Eddie's cover of \\" Dream A Little Dream\\" is slow and sexy.  His vocals make me love this song.  More Than You Know\\" has a love letter quality to it.  This song is pleasant to listen to.  \\"Longing To Belong\\" is another song that makes me wish I had someone to confess my love to.  This song is a gem and worth the price of the CD alone.  \\"Satellite\\" is a song about trying to reach special person.  I enjoy the romantic sentiment of the track \\"Without You\\".  Eddie's ukulele playing alone makes this song beautiful.  His vocals really move  me here.  This CD has only 34 minutes of music, but Eddie does is make me a bigger fan of ukulele music with this album.

Beautiful graphics, catchy music, addicting gameplay, it has it all  You owe it to yourself to get this game. It's worth every single penny and then some if you can't get it free on launch day.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is amazing! I mean how more amazing could it get. It works amazing on the Galaxy Tab and doesnt lag or anything. Super entertaining and after all its free for the day. A must have! You'll enjoy every minute of it.
B004LAIU4I|5.0|Wish it had a couple more songs on it. More of a good thing is always nice to have.<br /><br />Loved this CD completely. The only problem being that some of the songs get stuck my head when I'm driving around but I can't remember all the words so have to wait until I'm home to listen to it again and pay attention to the lyrics.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is fantastic, my favorite mobile game.    That said I think a few people are right; while the actual game looks pretty good, the menus are somewhat pixalated.  They probably did reuse the menu images from the iPhone.    This does not detract from the game play however and I still love it.
B003Y5H556|2.0|Where are the writers? Hunky boyfriend and a daddy whose - well, I won't give it away. But my god, have we forgotten how to write a movie. The look of this film was impressive. The cinematography is gorgeous, but the script was Missing In Action. Why? With such impressive visuals the dialogue is just silly and the bastardization of the original fairy tale is unfortunate. Well, maybe this film can serve as a cautionary tale of what not to do with a script and how not to retell a fairytale.<br /><br />2 Stars for the Cinematography<br />Minus Three stars for the script
B004SBQGHS|2.0|man i dont know why people think angry birds is the best game ever. it was awesome the first 500 times i played it. plants vs. zombies is much better(5 stars). if your reading my review... dont buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002NZK5TG|5.0|This movie was really good. I recommend it to anyone who likes strange old movies. One point though, the copy I got worked for most of the movie except in some parts it would stop and start. So if you want to buy this movie get the better copy.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Wtf is wrong with you people? You are seriously giving this app a one star rating because it isn't compatible with the Motorola Droid, even after it says it in the description?! So with that logic, I guess I'm supposed to go through and give a low rating and complain on every app out there that isn't compatible with the HTC Incredible, right? Hell no, I'd look like a moron. Boo effing hoo. You all sound like spoiled brat children that just got told no for the first time. Do the rest of us a favor and go have your temper tantrums privately.   The point of the rating system is so you can try the app, then leave your opinion on what you think about it (example: glitchy, laggy, fun, entertaining, boring, useful, useless... you get the idea). You don't give a low rating just so you can repeat what has already been stated in the product description.   My review: This game is a lot more fun than i initially thought it would be, and I'm glad I got it. So far I haven't noticed any problems with gameplay. Kudos to the devs, you can tell they put a lot of hard work and imagination into this. 5 stars *****

I'm upset when an app doesn't work but that what happens when living on the edge!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|LG P500, very happy about this app, great game, one of my favourite ones. Even better than the PC experiance.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game!  It works great on the original Motorola Droid running Simply Stunning and overclocked at 1 GHz.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Those that are having issues getting this to load on the Droid X (The description reminds that it may not work), simply go to your setting-applications-manage applications-find plant vs. zombies and clear data.    I was getting the initial load screen and then kicked back my home screen. Once I did this it worked. Don't know if it will work for everyone, but its an option before you uninstall.    As for the game, its fun, and a little different, but nothing new. You will get a few hours of entertainment so for the most part, its worth the download.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Why do people rate one star out of hate, when its not made for their phone?! Get a life, or new phone. When you actually play the game, please review.  Had PvZ on iphone, just as good on my  Droid X via bigger screen!
B003E6K1VK|2.0|Worked great for the first four months I had it then stopped working. I contacted the manufacturer and they advised me to contact Amazon who was very helpful in arranging for a return.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Seemed to download w/o problems. Selected to install and looked like it was working, but got msg that the app was not installed.  Pocket Edge w/ Ermine beta upgrade
B0052UZIFA|4.0|The gameplay is spectacular as you would expect from Popcap on the other hand how long it took for an Android release is almost shameful especially when they even take time to port it in true HD. PVZ HD on iPad and PVZ pc on an HD display look fantastic almost like its popping of the screen. These graphics look like crap in comparison. Really disappointed about this after such a long wait and having both a phone and tablet capable of HD.   I always thought of the name Popcap as top notch quality they really letting me down on android releases so far. Hope they go back upgraded the graphics or make HD version which I will gladly pay $5 for.
1400049628|3.0|I was a fan of the \\"zombie movement\\" as a teenager-- loved the zombie games, movies, and forums (an ex boyfriend of mine once said that when I mentioned \\"the zombie apocalypse\\" on the first date, he was in love), so I caught a lot of the pop culture references in Brook's book. So \\"zombie squad\\" forums and the zombie cult fans existed prior this book and provide plenty of Brooks's material, but after this was published, the zombie scene exploded. Now there are Listmania! lists for surviving what everyone knows now as \\"the zombie apocalypse.\\" In fact, several of the \\"real life\\" disaster books I've read since this book make a point of saying \\"this book will NOT prepare you for the zombie apocalypse.\\" Just think of how influential this book has been that real prep books now have the word \\"zombie\\" in the indexes.<br /><br />I gave this book three stars (as opposed to five) because it doesn't break any new ground in zombie culture, despite being the book that prompted a lot more interest in the zombie \\"movement.\\" And while it is fun to read, it's not hilarious by any means. However, it was also thought-provoking, and I credit the kernels of urban disaster preparedness in this book as getting me interested in real life disaster preparedness. Don't be surprised if you actually start researching BOBs and urban disaster prep after reading this.
0307887960|4.0|My husband and I are on this diet and it does work. The only draw back is that it gets boring because you eat the same meat all the time. My husband has lost 12 pounds in about 3 weeks so he is happy. I like the diet also. I just crave carbs so its been more a challenge. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to lose weight. I think with this diet you really can maintain the loss also.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was disappointed to find out that Plants vs Zombies was not out for Android when I got my phone. However, now that it is, I can say that I am very pleased with it. for those of you complaining about compatibility, check the description before trying to ruin a games reputation.
1416550534|5.0|I loved this book. I read The Forgotten Garden and loved it also, but this one I will read again. It has a great twist that I didn't see coming and I loved it. I hate when I can predict the end of a book and I was all wrong on this one. If you like Forgotten Garden you will LOVE  House at Riverton.
B004V6MWFU|5.0|Although Vedder may be known to most as a rock singer, he is truly a lyrical genius and a story teller of our generation.  Many generations have had there era defined by the greats...The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Who, to name a very few.  For many, our generation's voice can be heard through Eddie Vedder's.  His song's are more than rhymes and thoughtless convection.  They are story's of his life, full of raw emotion.    A voice like no other.  Simple love songs.  Meaningful lyrics.  Beautiful music.    You won't be disappointed.
B00005JY1O|3.0|This, like all Sundazed pressings, is very well done, especially in the modest price range they sell for. I am a mono maniac, but Dylan in mono just doesn't sound as good as the stereo version. And i am comparing it to the DCC Gold disc from 1992, and the SACD from 2003. But it still is a good presentation.
B004K4AUZW|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM I HAVE EVER OWNED/HEARD.! LADY GAGA IS BACK AGAIN WITH ONCE AGAIN A NUMBER 1 HIT ALBUM.!

0810997827|5.0|Purchased for my grandson.  The books are hilarious and he loves reading them. You can't beat Amazon's price, and btw, there was also free shipping. We got lots of \\"best present ever credit\\" at a budget price.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|it shows the loading screen and then just crashes on my droid x. Too bad because I was looking forward to this.
B0042RUMEQ|4.0|Nicki Minaj's favourite word is the f word!  It's kool 2 hear the f bomb every now and again, this album is littered with the infamous word.  My fave tracks include Moment 4 Life, Fly, Save Me and Last Chance.  It took me awhile to really get into Nicki Minaj, so this album grew on me.  I like hearing her stories and her rhymes.
0425242099|3.0|One of the most anticipated books this year is Kiss of Snow (book #10) by Nalini Singh. Nalini has come a long way with her Psy-Changeling series. I can still remember the first time I picked up Slave to Sensation back in 2006, knowing I found an author I'd stick with for life. Nalini is an incredibly talented author, and if you're not reading her books, you're missing out on something special.<br /><br />I read Kiss of Snow a few months ago and was on the fence whether or not I should review it. The reason is there are some things I enjoyed reading, while there were other things I found lacking. Kiss of Snow, from the overwhelming amount of reviews posted, is where everyone is head of heels in love with this book. It seems I'm in the minority here. Honestly, it's hard to  review Kiss of Snow because not only have I met Nalini and chatted with her in emails, but as I said before, I've enjoyed the majority of what she's written. Kiss of Snow was missing something for me as a reader. At one point I had to put the book down and read something else, and then come back to it. I think my problem lies with expectation. This happens from time to time and Kiss of Snow is a perfect example of this.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow is what the Psy-Changeling fans have been waiting for, especially those who adore Sienna, the young X-Psy refugee, and her love for Hawke, the uber alpha wolf of the SnowDancer pack. These two have been dancing around each other since the moment they met. Hawke's desire for Sienna has grown to the point where he's consumed with jealousy and incredible frustration. (The man has a serious case of mega blue balls) Hawke keeps his feeling bottled up inside because he feels Sienna is too young and fragile to take him on. (Sienna is 19 and Hawke is almost 30) Plus Hawke is dedicated to the memory of his mate he lost when he was very young. Very young is the key thing here as in Hawke and the girl he loved never connected on a level together as a grown man and woman. Because of this he feels he can't mate with any other woman, most of all a Psy, like Sienna.<br /><br />Sienna is tortured in every single way. We've seen this many times with past Psy heroines. She has the ability to be a true unemotional killer, a weapon much like her Uncle Judd once was. But Sienna is not cold and distant, or in control as everyone around her thinks her to be. Sienna is slowly breaking down inside and can barely keep up her defenses because of Hawke. She wants Hawke desperately and longs to be the one he turns to for intimacy.<br /><br />These two can hardly be around each other without acting out. The way things have been between Sienna and Hawke has come to an end and new beginning is in store for them. Sienna decides to throw herself in Hawke's face by acting as if she doesn't need him. She goes off with her Changeling friends to bars and clubs, while Hawke broods and smolders, his inner beast fighting to break free to claim Sienna as his own. And then finally Hawke can't take it anymore. All bets are off. Hawke unleashes his snarling wolf and Sienna no longer has a chance because Hawke is finished with the games and wants to play on his terms.<br /><br />Sienna and Hawke's passion for one another is combustible. Hawke doesn't pounce on Sienna right away, but courts her with deadly precision. It's like he's going off to war. Sienna wants Hawke in all his forms, but is scared because of what lies inside her. These two take a long time to come together. Kiss of Snow is one big buildup of foreplay where I was frustrated alongside these two. But when they throw all caution aside, their love scenes will scorch your eyeballs when they finally share their bodies with one another.<br /><br />The majority of the plot is dedicated to Sienna and Hawke, but we do see another, tender side with Sienna's, innocent in the ways of intimacy, Uncle Walker and the SnowDancer healer, Lara. These two are the complete opposites from their counterparts and their interactions were lovely, so much so I was more interested in them at one point. Also Judd has a great deal of interaction, including Sasha and Lucas, whose happily ever after is in full force. These two are still my all-time favorite couple in the series and I was so happy to see them and their growing family.<br /><br />With all these wonderful characters and their relationships, you'd think Kiss of Snow would be a perfect novel. It wasn't for me. I found Kiss of Snow to be more surface reading if anything, the depth was lacking and the focus was off. Many sections were shortened and there wasn't much action overall. There was a great deal of talking and internal musing, mainly from Sienna and Hawke. I was disappointed how Sienna's relationship with Kit was played out. I felt that was as cop out, a way to get Kit out of the way so everything could be concentrated on Sienna and Hawke. I was expecting much more with Kit and Sienna, for him to be the catalyst to push Hawke into claiming Sienna, but their relationship was cut off abruptly.<br /><br />The last fifty pages are explosive. If only this could have been occurred from the very beginning. There's a secondary story with Judd, his Arrows and a big surprise thanks to the Ghost that you won't see coming. I have a good idea the Ghost could be one of two characters, one who is obvious, the other way under the radar, and if Nalini decides to go with the one readers least expects, you can bet it will be shocking to the max.<br /><br />There's been a great deal of discussion about books being subjective, and for me Kiss of Snow is a perfect example. I realize I'm in the small minority with Kiss of Snow, and although I was less than astounded by what I read, I'm still very much dedicated to this series. Nalini has created a world and a group of characters I'll never forget. I just wish Kiss of Snow had been that book I couldn't stop thinking about. Unfortunately it wasn't. I do look forward to even more Psy-Changeling books in the future and wait with baited breath for her announcement about Kaleb and his book. *gets downs on knees that Kaleb gets his own book*<br /><br />If you're a diehard fan of Sienna and Hawke you'll want to have babies with this book and will most likely re-read it many times until the next Psy-Changeling book is released.<br /><br />Katiebabsnterested in them at one point.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game. I have it for multiple systems, and I think it's a MUST play. I've played through it before, and it doesn't disappoint.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I can't say that I really get it.  This and Popcap's other game are delivered with such a ridiculous list of devices that aren't supported, including the OG Droid, which I bought when it came out.  Other reviewers smugly suggest that us OG Droid owners who bought the device that more or less created the critical mass for Android's success are in possession of an \\"outdated phone\\".  Really???  My calendar says that my phone is only 1 1/2 years old.  Outdated?  I still have a ways to go in the 2 year contract I had to renew in order to get a decent price on it.  Can we not even make it to the end of a lousy 2 year contract before our phone is considered obsolete?  Is this advice coming from people who buy a new smartphone every single year, at full retail price, which no one should need to do?  Come on, two years should be a fair life.    As for Popcap, I don't accept the notion that these games couldn't have been made to work on more of the devices that are listed as being incompatible.  I've played PvZ on other platforms and I'm well aware of the scope of the game.  Other games of similar scope work beautifully on the OG Droid. This game worked on the older iPhone, which hardware-wise was no more powerful in any way than this Droid.  Less so, in fact, if I recall correctly.  My guess is very inefficient coding, or maybe Popcap has built some sort of underlying runtime layer for their games which the actual game sits atop.  Maybe that's why it's so huge and can't run on so many devices that don't have the incredible horsepower needed by these games.  In any case, I implore Popcap to please figure this out...
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Might be my phone's fault.. but when I hit the phone's menu button.. my controls stopped working.. I couldn't get out of the game.  the level played to the end without me doing anything.   Eventually had to long press power to reboot the phone.   Again.. not sure if it's my phone's fault.   The game is solid.. and I hope to see more popcap on Android.
1591843790|3.0|In this work Guy Kawasaki manages to take basic truths about business, sprinkle in a little bit of useful information about the latest social media technologies, stretches it all into book length and emerges with a book that will underwhelm anyone who has read other business books related to marketing, branding and/or customer satisfaction.<br /><br />That is not to say the book does not have an audience.<br /><br />If you are a young entrepreneur or new to business management then this is a good book that will teach you the basic generalities of how to create useful products that people want and appreciate.  You'll gain a better understanding of why it is important to be truthful in your marketing, why it is important to create realistic expectations for customers and why delivering on promises (and making the right promises) will help you build your brand.  You'll gain a better idea, conceptually, of how to create products that stand out and are different in a crowded marketplace.<br /><br />For those who have read other books on business management or basic marketing the triteness of this work will envelop you in a familiar fog of vague, basic truths about how to deal with people in the manner or style of Dale Carnegie, Napoleon Hill and Zig Ziglar.  If you are looking for meatier nuggets than \\"be likeable, \\"be trustworthy\\" and \\"be prepared\\" then you'll want to pass on this work unless you are seeking a breezy refresher or looking to renew your commitment to The Boy Scout Law.<br /><br />The later chapters that provide some useful and actionable information on how to most effectively produce online marketing videos and how to leverage push/pull technologies earn it three stars from me, but I was hoping for much deeper insights, more current case studies and more actionable information.<br /><br />~~ Review by The Marketing Guy Who Drives Sales, author of the e-book, \\"How to Build and Manage Your Brand (in sickness and in health).\\"

1416550534|5.0|I do not usually read \\"mysteries\\" but decided to try Kate Morton's novels when a friend recommended The House at Riverton.  I'm so glad I did.  Morton creates characters I care about.  I love the way the author gives readers an insider's view of life - upstairs and downstairs - at Riverton, an upper class British estate, during a bygone era, yet keeps us firmly anchored in the present, exploring the perspectives of a woman haunted by her past.  I couldn't put the book down! Even though I was able to anticipate many (not all) of the plot twists, verifying my predictions kept me reading long into the night.   An intriguing tale.
B003L20IFQ|4.0|There have been a number of these \\"Shot in one spot\\" movies lately - stuff like [[ASIN:B00064AE0G Open Water (Widescreen Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B0034G4OVS Frozen]]. This one takes it a step further, moving from a group of actors to a single actor, and eliminating any lead up time to 'the spot' - it starts off right at that moment and continues there until the end. One location, one actor on screen.<br /><br />I thought it was interesting throughout - quite a few unbelievable moments that will have you saying \\"Come on, really?\\", but still enjoyable. I didn't care for titles like Frozen, partly because of the unrealistic moments, but even with it's share I still enjoyed Buried. Haven't really seen a movie like it before, but it's not a fantastic must-see movie.<br /><br />Acting was good from almost everyone - Ryan Reynolds was very good, some of the people on the phone were trying a bit too hard, but nothing 'bad'.<br /><br />VIDEO QUALITY: A lot of people seem to say \\"It's really good.. for a movie filmed inside a dark box!\\" which didn't really mean much to me. Does that mean it's \\"OK\\" looking, or \\"GREAT\\" looking, not counting the fact it was filmed in a box. After seeing it, I'd have to say \\"It's really good.. for a movie filmed inside a dark box!\\" ;)<br />Actually, a lot of it will depend on your TV - I had mine calibrated but the \\"Black Levels\\" set to Light - this worked great in most movies, but was very distracting in this one. You could see the color temperature shifts from post-production (the black would turn a shade of orange or blue, depending which way that scene went), you could also see the artificial brightening in areas such as Ryan's face. It wasn't until I set my TV to \\"Black Levels -- Dark\\" that it actually looked good, and it looked great! Blacks were very dark, colors were nice, loads of sharpness and some (non-distracting) grain.<br /><br />AUDIO QUALITY: was fantastic - for being in a box, theres a lot of surround sound usage between the actor and the music (which was excellent and pretty creepy).<br /><br />EXTRAS: A short featurette - nothing great, but interesting. The most distracting thing is that it's in Standard Definition, filmed in what appears to be non-anamorphic letterbox (so on an HDTV, you get bars on the top, bottom, left and right) - For a 2011 Blu-Ray, this shouldn't be happening. The Blu-Ray also includes a DVD copy of the film.<br /><br />Overall an interesting movie, very good video/audio quality. I was expecting it to be a single-watch movie, but can see myself watching it over a few times at least.nt and pretty creepy).    EXTRAS: A short featurette - nothing great, but interesting.

1416550550|5.0|I picked up this book just after finishing The House at Riverton, which I also loved.  The Forgotten Garden is just as good, perhaps better. Lots of twists and turns, interesting characters, and vivid descriptions.  Highly recommend.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|cool app. if installed then played and want to move to sd, clear data then start or no start. tbolt
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game! Looks just like IPhone version to me. plays very smooth on MT4G. Yes the Moto Droid was the phone that put Android on the map, but by today's standards is an old phone. It can't last forever.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Omigosh! Is this really on my phone? Wait. Let me pinch someone I don't know and who is much smaller than me. Brb. Yep..its..on..my..PHONE! MY ANDROID PHONE!! this plays great on my 4.5&quot; screened Infuse! Forget that puny 3.5 fruit phone! This is awesome!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|One of the most addicting games ever. Great on the PC and now on android?!? Get it!<br /><br />For those of you on the fence, yes its a very large game for android (73mb). If you have a high end phone, don't worry! You should definitely have space! If you're rooted and have apps2sd, move this kick ass game to that SD card and get addicted to PvsZ!!
030746363X|5.0|Hi, Ferriss' book has been a real motivator for me.  I have been following his diet and exercise recommendation in 4-Hour Body for 1 month.  I feel great, lost 2 pounds according to the scale, but have lost 5 inches total from my waist, 2 arms and 2 thighs.  I am happy so far and plan to continue for a while and hope to get my weight down further via losing body fat and not muscle.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I've played this game on a variety of platforms including on Google Chrome, Firefox, Nintendo DS, and the Apple Maxipad.<br /><br />The game is consistently fun.  Nothing like encouraging the green in you to wack some zombies with pea shooters.  The kids love this game with its faux violence.  Perhaps it will encourage them to eat their vegetables too!<br /><br />The graphics are fine for what it is.  I feel its important to focus more on game play than it is on graphics.  Pop Cap has it right with this formula game and the price on Amazon is PERFECT!  ITs FREE.  How can you beat that?<br /><br />Even at $2.99, its still worth it.  Hopefully they'll come up with some additional sequels which keep the fun and the campy pixelated graphics.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this game.  Well worth it.<br /><br />The Nintendo DS version is also quite good and leverages the pen.  Played on HTC EVO and Barnes & Noble Color Nook.  Nook Color rocks!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|i love this game!. I've been waiting for ever to play this game on android!, although  it only needs HD graphics.. Motorola Atrix 4G

B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Well what a fantastic series and set of actors.  However thanks to the SyFy Channel and MGM you wont be left with a nice warm feeling inside, instead you will be asking, WHAT!, thats it, where is my decent ending?    The show never intended to be cancelled and left us with a massive cliff hanger,the show did get cancelled and we the fans were left with a \\"WTH\\" moment forever to be wondering what happened next.    Well Im not happy with that, and neither are thousands more people like me. I urge all Stargate fans to purchase the series because its a great television show and something that in years to come will be regarded in a cult status.  But before that the fans are fighting back and trying to get a third season. We deserve a 3rd season or a movie to tie up the show. Join us and give your support over on Facebook by typing Save Stargate universe into the search bar, or simply follow this link here. [...]    Purchase this DVD boxset because you wont just be buying a great DVD set, buy you will be helping show MGM that this show deserves more.    Save Stargate Universe!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game is amazing I was supprised the it is like the full PC version. runs flawlessly on HTC evo.... also 53 people need to buy new phones... solid 5 stars
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Game works great on my phone. had to download over WiFi? So what, it was free! File too big? So what, move it to the SD. It's a great game to have on a supported device and hope more PopCap games are coming.

B002ZG97EC|4.0|When I first saw trailers for Despicable Me, I wasn't interested at all. Even though the main character was a bad guy, nothing about it looked appealing to me, so I passed on watching it until I had nothing else to watch one day, and finally gave it a chance. It's not a great movie by any means- definitely nothing that could give Pixar or some of Dreamworks' select good movies a run for their money...but you know what? This is the best full-length cartoon I've ever seen. Yeah, I said it: cartoon, not animated feature. Anyone who loves watching Wile E. Coyote try to capture the Road Runner with different kinds of weapons and gadgets will enjoy Despicable Me. It's just plain fun, and something I appreciate them trying instead of a Best Animated Picture contender, or Pop Culture References: The Movie. However, it's sadly held back from being something greater.    Gru is the self-proclaimed world's greatest villain, stealing such well-known monuments as the Statue of Liberty (from Las Vegas), but someone out there is stealing his thunder. A much younger villain, Vector, is having better luck by stealing the pyramids, and as a result, the secret bank that supports successful bad guys isn't going to be helping out Gru any more. To make matters worse, Vector also managed to steal a Shrink Ray, which was a key ingredient in Gru's plan to steal the moon and be #1 once again. The only people able to access Vector's fortress are girl scouts, who also happen to be orphans, and Gru quickly adopts them in order to get the Shrink Ray and fulfill a childhood dream of going to the moon [and taking it].    The story isn't very original, and even borrows a lot of points from other fairly recent animated movies like The Incredibles and Meet the Robinsons, but where it shines is the comedy of Gru vs Vector. Watching these guys try to outdo eachother was comic gold, and I wished that more of the movie focused on this instead of the sweet lil' orphans that seemed to be forced into the plot. Just when Gru and Vector were having a great fight, we'd cut back to the orphan girls and their problems. Apart from them being the Cindy Lou Who to Gru's Grinch, there's not much use for them (well, aside from the infamous unicorn bit). Two of the three are generic and forgettable, and I'm sure there were other ways the writers could've gotten around using them as a way of getting Gru into Vector's lair. It doesn't ruin the movie by any means, but I wanted to see more of those two buffoons messing with eachother. There were times where I was actually laughing out loud, and that's rare for me. The Minions were a pretty good addition, and kids will love these guys, especially when they start using a copying machine.    The picture and audio on the blu-ray are both perfect, and I was surprised that a non-Pixar film got such great treatment in these departments. The AVC BD50 encode is a sight to behold, and there were many times when I was rewinding the movie just to pay attention to every little detail in some scenes. It doesn't hurt that the art direction was really good too. And if you have a good home theater setup, just wait until the scene where Gru shoots missiles at Vector- hearing those suckers go off in every direction is awesome. Unfortunately the audio is only available in English, with subtitles in English, Spanish and French are included.    Regarding the special features, the list on the back of the box is HUGE, but they went with quantity over quality. The best of the bunch for me were the cookie recipes, interviews with the voice actors, and to an extent, the commentary track. The problem is that the Minions were such a hit, that they were shoved into nearly every feature here, even a picture-in-picture track that lets you shoot Minions at the screen. The commentary track was genuinely good, but even there the Minions were crowbarred in and damper the enjoyment. The rest of the features are your standard stuff- an EPK featurette with people involvedwith making the movie, a look at the world of the movie, a look at the making of the soundtrack, games, etc. And of course, there are 3 short movies with the Minions.    Despicable Me is an enjoyable movie for kids and adults, especially for those who grew up with the Warner Bros. cartoons, and I can't help but wonder how much better the movie could've been if the orphans were removed or less of a focus. Maybe if a sequel comes out, we'll get a true bad guy bonanza, though I'd settle for 5 minute shorts of Gru vs Vector as well.
B004EPYZU8|4.0|I anxiously awaited the release of this movie after seeing the first trailer. \\"What's it about?\\" I pondered with my co-workers, musing on possible plot theories. (Working in a restaurant kitchen leaves you lots of time to ponder lifes mysteries)<br />Overall, I think Zack Snyder is pretty damn good at making movies. His visuals are always striking, and the action sequences are always unbelievable. I loved \\"300\\" ([[ASIN:B000QXDED6 300 (Widescreen Edition)]]), and the remake of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" ([[ASIN:B001CW7ZW6 Dawn of the Dead (Unrated Director's Cut) [Blu-ray]]])is one of my favorites. His adaptation of \\"Watchmen\\" ([[ASIN:B001QTXM5Y Watchmen: The Director's Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)]])was very good, although lacking in the \\"psionic squid\\" department.( If you've read the graphic novel, you get it...if not, READ IT!!) Needless to say, the lead up to \\"Sucker Punch\\" had me shivering with anticipation.<br /><br />Well, the time came to see it, and much to my surprise despite the crappy reviews hurled forth at it, I really really liked it.<br />Granted it's no \\"Gone With the Wind\\" or anything like that, so don't go into it expecting an Oscar caliber film. That said, watching some really hot girls run around with guns, swords, and tactical tomahawks does something to you. Something nice. Very nice. Best thing to do...shut off your brain, don't think too much into the plot, and enjoy the scenery.<br /><br />Quick synopsis...\\"Babydoll\\" gets locked in a mental institution, and needs to find a way to get out before she's lobotomized. She fantasizes that she is actually being held against her will in a brothel and must dance to please her clients. Every time she dances, she goes to another fantasy world to obtain an item to effect her escape.<br /><br />It's certainly no \\"Inception\\", though dreams and fantasies are what it's all about. You see, when \\"Babydoll\\" dances, we are taken to one of her escapist fantasies, along with her co-\\"dancers\\" Amber, Blondie, Sweet Pea, and Rocket. There's been lots of discussion about what each dream \\"level\\" means or alludes to. I have my theories (as does everyone else) ,so if you feel the need to further analyze those sequences, knock yourself out.<br /><br />I won't go into hard detail of the movie itself, as many have done before, but if you like fantastic visuals,ridiculous action, blinding violence, dragons, hot girls, zombie stormtroopers, giant samurai with miniguns,B-25 bombers, and mech-suits with pink bunny faces painted on them, then this movie is definitely for you.of discussion about what each dream \\"level\\" means or alludes to.

B0052UZIFA|4.0|The game downloaded quickly via wifi. Game launches without error. I haven't played this game before today. From my first impression, this seems to be a keeper.
B004JN1D2I|1.0|I've been borrowing a friend's book to read the first few chapters and the TV show is awesome.<br /><br />I'd really love to purchase this on my kindle, but unfortunately the price gouging is absolutely ridiculous - even at $30. Fix this!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Phenominal album from a phenominal band.  These two guys are making the best music today, it's a shame they are not more widely known.  This is a slight departure from their previous albums but in a progressive, intelligent direction.  That being said, go pick up another couple of their albums, like 'Rubber Factory' or 'Attack and Release'.  Personally I love all their albums and Dan's solo record (it's not the black keys, but it's very, very good as well) so I highly doubt you will be disappointed by any of their albums as long as you like blues based rock and roll.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Love this game! I totally got addicted to it. Kinda wish they didn't put the end song here on the market, since getting to it by winning the game was a very nice treat, and this kind of spoils it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I originally played this game on the iPod Touch and loved it and every day since selling it I've been waiting for PvZ to be released on Android.  Now I have even more time wasters to use.
B003PGNBO8|4.0|Made in the same flavour as Lost and The Event, FlashForward is thankfully shorter but great fun to watch. I recommend it!
0425242099|4.0|Hawke, alpha of the SnowDancer pack and Sienna, a Psy that has found refuge with the SnowDancers have been dancing around each other for some time now. They both might have acted on their lust for each other but Sienna is just now 19. Sienna is also an extremely powerful X Psy - if her powers get out of control, she can decimate everything around her. Now living outside of Silence, no one knows exactly what is going to happen to her. Her powers are extremely volatile. She may be the only X cardinal ever born. No X-Psy has lives past their 25th birthday. And that was within Silence.<br /><br />Hawke can't deny the attraction, but he lost his mate when he was very young. Knowing a wolf only mates once, he doesn't know if Sienna can handle the demands his wolf would place upon her. But as he says - Pack is life, and Pack knows these two are meant for each other. With their support (and threats from Sienna's uncle) these two take a chance.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Psy Council is disintegrating. Sides are being taken, betrayals are in progress. There are those who want a race of Pure Psy - where Silence is law. While a civil war is on the horizon and some want to take the shifters down with them.<br /><br />Kiss of Snow is one of my most highly anticipated books of 2011. I fell in love with Hawke many books ago, and we finally get his story with Sienna. First let me say I love how Nalini writes her shifters. So sexy, sensual and physical. And Hawke does not disappoint. Some of the things that come out of his mouth melted me into a puddle of goo. He calls Sienna \\"baby\\" a lot and it's hot. He has to learn to walk the line between being Sienna's alpha and her lover. He is of course alpha down to his core, and Sienna soon learns playing with his wolf is more fun than she ever thought. They play games, they dance around one another and in the end, they have a beautiful relationship.<br /><br />While the sexual tension is off the wall, halfway through the book, maybe even a little farther I was ready for it to progress to more than just tension. There are so many \\"almost\\" moments - they almost kiss, they almost embrace, they almost get physical. But Hawke's phone rings, or Psy attack, or someone interrupts them. At a certain point it became a little frustrating and distracting. But by the end of the book I was able to look back on their moments together with fondness.<br /><br />Sienna is a X-Psy, and kind of in the dark with how to control her powers and what her eventual outcome will be. At a young age, she was taken from her home to be Ming's prot&eacute;g&eacute;. She went into silence by the age of nine. There is a lot of unknown for her out in the \\"real world.\\" There is rumor of an elusive journal written in the 70's that might give her some answers, and this plays in well in the book. I think Nalini Singh does a nice job portraying Sienna - she has inner strength and confidence, but when her power flares up she really loses all control.<br /><br />I have been disappointed in the past few books with how the Psy war has progressed - or how it has not progressed. In Kiss of Snow I think that storyline has a little more meat. I still want more - maybe just more from the Psy's point of view. But at least in this one, the Psy mean business and it felt more like they are a threat to the shifters.<br /><br />Walker Lauren, Sienna's uncle has a really nice romance in this one with Lara, the SnowDancer healer. I really liked both of them and thought their romance brought a lot to this story. We also get a lot with Judd, Sienna's other uncle since he is so close with Sienna and helps her with her volatile powers. Oh Judd - you sexy former Psy. He has some great lines and one in particular very smexy scene. It's so nice we get an intimate glimpse into some of the characters that have already had their book.<br /><br />Sascha and Lucas have a storyline that will make you smile. I really enjoy the relationship the Cats now have with the wolves. It feels like a brotherly relationship with good natured bickering - very entertaining to read.<br /><br />For such an anticipated book, Kiss of Snow delivers. I even think this one can be read as a stand alone. You might be a bit confused on the Psy war, but overall I think it would read well on it's own. Of course, this entire series is great, and I recommend it to everyone.entertaining to read.    For such an anticipated book, Kiss of Snow delivers.

0670022411|4.0|Imagine the magical world of Harry Potter, the inter-species love story of Twilight and the dimensional exploration of a Wrinkle in Time - and you have this wonderful book.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am looking forward to the sequals!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|That must be the entirety of the game because that's all it said. Wouldn't display the keyboard so I couldn't type a name and wouldn't let me continue without doing so. Was forced to rip the battery out of my phone after trying to enter a name. Tried again and had the same issue. I own one of the most powerful phones on the market, so this is pretty ridiculous. Droid Charge.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|First I can say that this absolutely will not run on a Droid 1, even if you trick it into installing.  The size and memory usage on this game is disproportionate to its content.  There are a lot of games on the Marketplace that look just as good and are far smaller and leaner than this clunker.  This is the second Popcap game I have seen that is this way.  There may be an emulation layer involved with their games that is inflating its size and hardware requirements.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|worth the wait, and even free on first day. Been playing all day and there is no lag whatsoever. AWESOME
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I've heard that folks who have rooted with a custom ROM can run the game just fine on a DROID. Why not support it? Very very shoddy. So many other games run on the DROID.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|What can I say other than I'm very disappointed and just lost money.  I would like to rate the product once i can use it.  i would rate it zero if allowed.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I think the reason I am disappointed is that I have been waiting for months for this game, and I can't even play it on my original Motorola Droid.  Therefore, I give it one star, I'd give zero if I could, as I think this is fail on the part of Popcap to not make it compatible with all devices when most games that are released are.  Oh well, at least I still have Angry Birds to pass the time.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|How do you make a psycho-thriller even more of a thriller? You add in a State Trooper that is a sharpshooter, a widow that is drop dead gorgeous with an extreme amount of excess baggage, and a small 4-year old boy that is deathly ill of some disease no one can quite figure out. You stir in a serial killer, a set of in-laws that should be outlaws and you have a recipe for a grip your seat ride into Bobby's personal hell. The producers of Criminal Minds would appreciate this tale of terror. Read it - you won't be disappointed.

B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Yuck. Another author trying to be the next J K Rowling or Charlaine Harris. This first (and last for me) installment is all about the set up. It provides lots of boring details interspersed here and there with characters that I found barely interesting. It's an obvious franchise attempt ending with a promise of upcoming action. I hate getting suckered into throwing away hard earned money and am kicking myself for not reading the 1 and 2 star reviews that totally would have warned me in advance to just not bother. You've been warned: It's a boring prequel that left me wanting for nothing more from the author.
1932100660|5.0|This, by far, has been my favorite book about nutrition of all time. It can get a little technical at moments but overall it's easy to understand - and most importantly, it truly makes you think about what you are putting into your body. This book was the ultimate deciding factor in my fight to be vegan or not. Any worries I had about the vegan lifestyle were silenced by this book. I have already been recommending it to everyone I know!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Finally Plants vs Zombies is here to Android, it plays flawless if you have a decent phone.  Not all phones that have Android can run all the apps great, those are hardware limitations of your personal phone.  Stop getting mad at the fact your phone is not as good as it needs to be to run everything flawlessly.  One reviewer is clearly disappointed there phone is not supported, than says it is because of the \\"limitations and flaws of the game\\".  Honestly, 78MB for a fully featured game is not terrible. If your phone cannot handle that, invest in a new phone.    Plants vs Zombies is a classic that has finally made it to Android.  It plays perfectly, especially for the price. FREE.    Even at $2.99 I would have purchased the game.    (I have a rooted HTC HD2)
0307595862|4.0|I doubt anyone needs it reiterated that Jo Nesbo knows the thriller/suspense genre of the mystery very, very well. He has certainly mastered the art of the sudden jolt, inserting random plot events so brutal - often so unsuspected - the reader's attention is instantly snapped back to the moment.<br /><br />The only drawback is at times he let me lull longer than I liked. At between the 1/2 and 3/4 mark, give or take 50 pages, things became so quiet I committed the ultimate sin: I tried Googling the ending. I was getting restless with the plodding plot. Looking ahead I saw I had a while to go yet. I contemplated dropping The Snow Man for another book.<br /><br />(Oh, and by the way? I was right about the identity of the Snow Man. It was one part the person's occupation/skill, one part opportunity, and the rest a matter of... Sorry, can't say!)<br /><br />The red herrings - at least one I'm thinking of - were well done. I believe the particular one I'm alluding to will pop up in a later Harry Hole series novel (and if you've finished the book you should know which I mean). Early on I was so sure Harry wasn't paying nearly enough attention to this character I wanted to slap him a couple of times to wake him up. It seemed so OBVIOUS! Good try, though, until I started adding up a few other clues.<br /><br />But not all red herrings are created equally. The one major herring just didn't sit right. And the explanation behind this person's elimination was so convoluted I found myself irritated, wishing the editor dared pare Nesbo down a bit. Because he can write doesn't mean everything he writes is great.<br /><br />Digressions aside, I love Harry Hole's character. Sure, he's the stereotypical \\"unlucky in love, great detective who fights alcohol addiction detective on the verge of being fired...\\" character, but something about that never gets old for me. Which of course is what largely drives this genre for females. Men get the action, violence and hot babes chasing our poor, misguided detective, and we get the misguided detective. Seems fair enough.<br /><br />I can't give five full stars to a book that left me lulling so long, even if I did greatly enjoy parts of it. The plot premise is very good (the motivation understandable but WOW, really?), the characters I can speak to (Harry, Katrine and the Baddies) well done, and the prose (noting it's in translation) consistent with the tone of the book.<br /><br />What determines my four stars? It's the author's intent - to lead us on a merry chase, make us sick to our stomachs, throw us off the path a few times, then come clean and explain the whys and hows - and how that measures up to what he accomplished. The strikes against him are the times he lags, which happened a couple of times, provoking my very bad behavior - Googling the killer, because things were too slow.<br /><br />The conclusion comes to four stars - not perfect enough for five, but definitely better than three, which is around average. Would I read him again? Probably, but for my money I'm pretty sweet on Ian Rankin and Inspector Rebus. Haven't run out of those quite yet, but when I do I'm up for grabs.<br /><br />So, who knows?<br /><br />- Lisa Guidarini, NBCCmisguided detective. Seems fair enough.

B00204AA0O|5.0|Regina Spektor's second album demonstrates a steady growth in her wonderful talent and expression. Continuing a distinct combination of pop with serious themes, she is a true successor to an earlier generation of singer/sonmgwriters.    I've listened to the 2nd album a dozen times in the week since purchase, and find new depth in the lyrics, a keen appreciation for her piano riffs, and I stand in awe of her vocal abilities.    For those who enjoyed her first work, have no fears of disappointment. She's getting better and better!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I've been so excitedly waiting for this app to come to the Amazon Appstore! I love Plants vs Zombies & have been dying to play it on my Android phone!<br /><br />I have the Samsung Epic & it looks amazing & works wonderful on my device. It's a large file so of course they have to limit it to WiFi download only, why would you want to take FOREVER via 3G?! I highly recommend this app to EVERYONE!! And for the first day being FREE is AMAZING!!!
B0052UZIFA|4.0|great except for the quirks outlined below. rooted mytouch 4g with gingerbread. to those complaining that it will not work on the Droid: the Droid is an old phone with old hardware, while it isn't the first android phone ( the T-Mobile g1 was the first) it is still limited by its hardware, not its software so you may be out of luck :(
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I think this is fantastic!!! I've checked amazon everyday waiting for this game. Thanks Amazon and PopCap!!! For those complaining, get a woman, and make sweet love to her. Hopefully it'll cure what sickness you have. Read disclaimer before you download. Now to play some awesome sauce Ps vs Zs!!!!! And why would anyone JUST buy an OG Droid unless they're buying it for a paper weight?!??!?!?!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|the game while fun is a memory hog. developer needs to set it up for SD card storage as most smart phones use large cards.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|Yes, its big and you have to get it through wifi. Shut up and deal. To those of you with tablets, stop giving games not optimized for your platform bad reviews. If you somehow paid for the app, contact amazon. Its a time zone issue. Other than that, enjoy.

B004BSFSTA|2.0|Could not wear for longer than 10 minutes without a surprising amount of serious discomfort.  Headband exerts so much tension and ear cups sit on ears.<br /><br />Sound quality is marginally better than crappy headphones that come with iPhone or iPod.<br />Aesthetically, I love the design, but Marshall needs to test their products on real people.<br /><br />I so like great aesthetic design that I would have probably kept them--even with sound quality being average--had they been at least somewhat bearable to wear.  These headphones are terribly uncomfortable.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I was super bummed after I bought my DROID and found out PvsZ was only available for the iphone.  App works great on the Droid2,  though the download time was a little ridiculous.  Well worth it for an amazing game though!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|excellent gameplay, works on my LG optimus S.<br /><br />nice graphic and runs smooth on my 600mhz processor
0439023513|5.0|I loved the first books so much and was pleased that Mockingjay was just as exciting.  Great way to end the series. I would recommend The Hunger Games series to everyone.  They are fast and easy to read.  There were so many late nights of reading because I couldn't put them down.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I know I love the game since I own the pc version, but after the download it keeps  crashing upon launch.  Hopefully the bugs can be worked out.  =s  Samsung Epic - Sprint

If you like tower defense games then you'll probably want to get this one. Well worth it!

B003NWS5AO|5.0|As a musician myself, I've always felt that \\"making\\" music should be fun.  Sure, it's hard work sometimes, but there comes a point when all the hard work pays off and the musician can just let loose, have fun and share in the joy of making music.  That's what this album is all about.  Robert Plant has certainly done all the hard work. He's paid his 'rock 'n roll' dues.  Buddy Miller, the guitarist on this album, has also paid his dues.  Band of Joy is all about the joy of making fun music together with a group of musicians and singers that all seem to take pride in what they do and share a love for sharing music.  I love this album.

B004UXUSIM|5.0|I have to admit that I have always thought of 1920's Paris as a golden time, an ideal time to be in the City of Light. So it was only natural for me to want to see Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris.  Without a doubt, Mr. Allen loves Paris. It is clear from the opening minutes when we are transported to all of the familiar spots in Paris.  Owen Wilson gives a splendid performance as Gil, a screenwriter who desperately wants to write novels.  After Gil's first time travel episode, meeting the likes of F.Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald and Cole Porter I found myself looking forward to his nightly travels into the past.  Rather than writing cliché-ridden dialogue for his famous characters, the conversations are very natural.  Perhaps the most memorable and humorous performance goes to Adrian Brody as Salvador Dali.      Midnight in Paris is a romantic comedy, with Gil on the verge of marrying the wrong woman (nicely played by Rachel McAdams).  Gil wants to show her why Paris is such a special place and she wants to go shopping.  Midnight in Paris is a charming, funny and thought provoking film that certainly was a hit with the audience when I saw it.     If you love Paris, then you owe it to yourself to see the new Woody Allen film.
1609419693|5.0|I bought this to listen to while driving across country - best purchase ever!  I will have to warn you that it may create an unsafe driving environment due to laughing so hard you cry - which can't be safe while driving...especially through the mountains.  Tina is ridiculously funny and to hear her read this made the trip go by really fast.  My face hurt from laughing so hard.  I listened to it on the way there and the way back, and it was MUCH funnier the second time!!  I highly recommend this to anyone who loves to laugh.  Because of this audiobook, I am a Tina Fey fan for life.  Love her!!
031261246X|5.0|Great book. I don't read a lot of fiction, but this was compelling and worth the read. First Kindle book I've gotten, too. The characters are all believable and you have immediate empathy for the protagonist. Not too technical for non-computer people, but you'd have to be interested in computers to get the most out of it. Some adult scenes that are different from my experience in IT, but that's part of the character development and plot. Storyline is very interesting and disclosed in a series of vignettes in a manner like Pulp Fiction, where it all eventually comes together. Also scared the hell out of me and made me want to beef up the security on all my computers. Check the news for cyber attacks and see how real this is.

0064407667|5.0|A Series of Unfortunate Events 1: The Bad Beginning / 9780061757099    I came to this book after already watching the tie-in movie \\"[[ASIN:B0007PICAI Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events]]\\". I was fairly certain I would like the novel, as I had enjoyed the movie well enough and I knew that the books were supposed to contain a lot of dark humor, but I was surprised at how very much I loved \\"The Bad Beginning\\".     This novel is slender and can be whipped through in a few short hours - if it has any drawbacks at all, it would perhaps be the price-to-page ratio. However, the story is engaging and well-told and it's impossible to not be drawn into the drama of the Baudelaire orphans as they struggle to survive in the wake of their parents' deaths. The children are wonderfully characterized, and it is such a breath of fresh air to have Violet as an active female character who invents things and scales towers; and brother Klaus is a delightful support character as the brainy bookworm who digs through libraries for answers to help the children out of peril. And, of course, Sunny the biter adds a great deal to the story with her loosely translated shrieks and baby gurgles.     A note about the audiobook edition of this book: this installation in the series is narrated by Tim Curry. He narrates the story superbly and adds a wonderful layer of creepy inflection over the entire affair. The pacing is excellent and the overall effect on the reader is very immersive and well worth the listen.     ~ Ana Mardoll

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Fun game, runs great on HTC ThunderBolt, took two stars away for not supporting my friends on original droids which I don't see any reason why it wouldn't run.
B004FOA84A|3.0|It is a great one time play wish that there was more or more challenging levels. The second time through I completed it in ten minutes.
0307272702|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to lose weight or to prevent getting fat. If you understand how it works, then it's much easier to make wise decisions regarding your diet and lifestyle.  Exactly one month ago I started the diet that follows the rules described by Taubes and I already lost 10 pounds of baby fat without being hungry. And I don't really crave sugar (now I crave almonds).
B003UESJ9M|1.0|Really bad script, and decent acting by the main characters could not save that, nor could fairly appealing singing by the lead actress, Ms. Paltrow. We don't really even get to hear her singing till the finale, which is followed by one of the more bizarre but barely engaging plot twists ever. The script and storytelling deserve a negative star.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Addictive gameplay, excellent artwork, high replayability (I'm on my third time through...) just get it already. you shan't be disappointed
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Stevie has done it again..the cd is great and the Secret Love track is just awesome..Italian Summer is as romantic as she tries to portray it and Cheaper Than Free is just nice and simple .on the whole, the whole album is fantastic..very glad I purchased it..
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have this game via Steam and now I can play this smoothly on my Android phone! Quite an addicting and very fun game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works flawlessly on my rooted Epic 4G with froyo ec05 build and the ext4 file system conversion. I mention the different file system because everything ran choppy in my phone before I rooted it and it was still running the stock RFS file system.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my mother, and while I haven't watched it myself, I have received rave reviews from her.  Excellent acting, she says.  On my end, I can say, I received the DVD even before the scheduled arrival date, which is always a plus.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I had this app on my ipod touch before and loved it! so glad its now on the android and free today on amazon app to boot!
0307454541|5.0|This book is so well known by this time (June 2011) that I don't think I need to go into any detail. Let me just say that there are few books that I can't put down. This one I read in two nights, one ending at 4 AM. (And I'm a slow reader.) Then I gave it to my wife yesterday, and she finished it today. I know that I'm going to be disappointed with the third in the trilogy, but I just ordered it. Oh, and the second book took me three days. The problem is, what do I do now?
B001NLKT60|4.0|I loved this book on my Kindle! I wish I would have known there was a prelude to it though so I felt sorta lost about the plot in the beginning. But the author weaves the story from the previous book into this book very well.I feel caught up now and can't wait to see what is in store for Salander and K.F.Blomkvist!! Those who have read it know what the initials mean!
030745455X|5.0|I couldn't put the first volume down, and then I couldn't get through this one fast enough. Disappointment awaits in the third one - I've already been warned - but I've got to know whether or not certain \\"issues\\" are resolved in the third book. I'm really going to miss Lizbeth.<br /><br />Oh, I hate writing book reviews. If you haven't heard about these books by now, then my two cents isn't going to be worth ... 2 cents. But if you love mysteries and intrigue, even with some implausible characters which I find in all my favorites, you'll love the first two volumes in this trilogy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|First, I would like to state that this is a great app and I am very mad at myself for not getting it when I first got my phone nearly a year ago. Secondly, I have no problems with the app, I would only like to suggest that it would be nice if there was something to show me progress in the books that I am reading like a percentage or some sort of page number.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Wasn't the Original Droid by Motorola what made Android?    Why in the world would that device not be supported?
B004NJW976|5.0|This is a pulsing, throbbing, beautiful piece of art.<br />I have one other Moby work, \\"Wait for Me\\". A little different then this but both are beautiful. I love anything with David Lynch's touch.<br />Destroyed is an apt title for the images that his music brings to my mind. The apocalypse has occurred. We are living in the post apocalyptic age. Living on borrowed time since the end of World War Two. We are witnessing nature's end and seem helpless to stop the destruction. The problem is us. But even with all of the destruction there is still beauty.<br /><br />The cover art  speaks volumes and each piece is appropriately titled.<br />This is terrific music. Gorgeous and emotionally satisfying.  Kick back and enjoy it while you can. It's later then you think.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very fun game.  Unique idea in &quot;tower defense&quot; type games. Worth the download (for free), but make sure to READ the app description to see if it works w your phone. Reading....is....fundamental.  Lmao.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Looks and runs great on my Droid X, but restarts if the phone rings. That's pretty inconvenient when you're almost through a level. Would be five stars without this issue.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|this game and and angry birds makes life complete. a fantastic port. resource intensive but great. running on my samsung galaxy s 4g. now back to playing,  got to save my house!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|This is another awful port of one of Popcap's games to the Android platform.  For the complexity of the gameplay (a sprite-animated fixed-view 3/4topdown) the download is massive and the system requirements are absurd.  It doesn't run on my HTC Hero CDMA because after taking over a minute at a loading screen, it runs out of memory and crashes.  I've run much more complex games on this device.  Popcap needs to seriously iron out their Android development process if they're planning on staying in the Android game. Playing from a tablet it even grinds nearly to a halt in some places.<br /><br />The game itself is a pretty fun tower defense sort of game that has character to it.  It is a shame it is crippled by such a poor effort to bring it to the platform.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Popcap must have rushed this one out. The quality of graphics on this version of the game is sub-par; it becomes obvious on tablets when you can clearly see artifacts on the popcap logo and other parts of the game. The graphics quality is also inconsistent between different aspects of the game. The plants look clearer than the zombies and the background. The speed and smoothness also vary; smooth during the actual gameplay but very laggy when you get a new plant. I hope that Popcap gets it together and fixes the quality of this game, rather than relying on name alone to carry this title.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Plants vs Zombies is a wonderful game on a number of platforms (handhelds, PCs, consoles, iOS devices) and I'm thrilled that it is finally available for Android.  While it has some great gameplay, I'm dissapointed by the size of the program, and the fact that it appears to not be optimized for Android or Android tablets.  I can't argue because of the initial launch price, but for a paid game from an established developer I had really hoped for a better experience and performance from a game that takes up so much memory on the phone.  Oh well, still fun.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Still a great game. There's a little lag at times (lots of plants &amp; zombies on screen) on my EVO 4G. Would pay full price for the game to support Pop Cap, but glad it's free.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|With 4g service on almost EVERY provider, the stupidity of making their games Wifi download ONLY is massively FAIL. Glad its free cause these people are morons.<br /><br />So, after finally downloading this game via wifi(which took a whopping 7 minutes(would have taken about 3 on 4g)) Im even more disappointed. The furthest Ive gotten has been that hourglass, and a black screen. Freezes up my phone and I have to do a battery pull. What a waste of an app. I heard it was a decent game on the PC, but sadly will never be played on my HTC Thunderbolt OC'd at 1.3ghz, and 190 density.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|About time Pop Cap started paying attention to Android. Game is super fun and there are no compromises. Great graphics and responsiveness.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I've heard a 100 bad reviews for this film.... as a die-hard fan i didn't hold out much hope but i was very pleasantly suprised by how down to earth and realistic this film was.  As a 35 year old female i could totally relate to the struggles each and every one of the ladies were facing....  the overwhelmingly chaotic married life of Charlotte's, Miranda's unsatisfied work life, Samatha's mid life crisis, and the desperate need to hang on to my youth as Carrie does.  The acting was brilliant, the fashion was awesome, and im still as proud as ever to say im a Sex In The City fan.  i hope the powers that be get one more chance to woo the public, but if they don't, this was a wonderful ending to my all time favorite franchise.
B004XUDJII|5.0|If you liked her first two singles, Jar of Hearts and Arms, then you will like this album.  She knows her style and all of the songs stay within that style.  It is not one of those albums where you buy it because you like one song, but find out that the rest of the album is nothing like that one song.  It's a great CD.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Works like a champ on my DX with gingerbread. Have played the game plenty on other systems and thoroughly enjoyed every moment.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a very fun addictive game. The only problem that I have with popcap games is that they don't update content. (like angry birds does every month) I have this is the same game it's been for years since it was pc only with no new levels or anything. Otherwise fantastic game :)
B0052UZIFA|4.0|It's working on my rooted Nook Color running Phiremod 6.2.  Played it some and so far its a cool game.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Good game and everyone who is giving it one star because it won't run obviously doesn't know how to read the compatibility list.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Very addicting game, and also free on Launch Day!  Also, to clarify, you only need WiFi to download since it's a big file, 72 MB, but you do not need WiFi to play it.
B004SKJTY6|1.0|- 9 star. waist of time.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This application is awesome. Thanks amazon for the free Apps. Works great on my Optimus s froyo. I don't know why people give one star reviews just because it is not compatible with their phone.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I love PvZ on my desktop so I thought this would be cool. But all I get is an hourglass and it closes. What gives? Using an archos 70.
B004WJV6OY|5.0|If you love Pearl Jam get this. While there are no acoustic versions of well known Pearl Jam songs here, what is here is stunning. You really get to see what a great singer and a surprisingly good guitar player Eddie is. You also get to see what a great songwriter he is with alot of the into the wild material performed here as well as two great Dylan covers. The behind the scenes stuff is cool and the stories Eddie tells between songs are really good. The sound is excellent and it was shot really well, with good close-ups of what he's doing on the guitar. You can probably learn how to play alot of these songs by watching this.
B003274QH6|5.0|Breaking Bad is simply incredible. This show, to me, has no weak points. It is, by nature, a very serious show, but, at the same time, has no trouble pulling off comedy.    Recommended it to a friend who doesn't watch any drama shows, simply because I knew he'd eat it up. Sure enough, he watched one episode after work one day, and that ended up being the entire first season in one sitting. Needless to say, I have created another Breaking Bad fiend.    I feel that this is an unfair comparison, but I am still going to make it: Breaking Bad is a better overall show than Mad Men. Mad Men is the show that introduced me to AMC, and is most likely the reason I was ever introduced to Breaking Bad. Don't get me wrong - Mad Men is still an excellent show, and I will continue to watch it in a adamant fashion. It was my favorite show for the last year or so since I was introduced to it. But Breaking Bad has now taken that place for me.     Please, everyone, watch this show. I know that there will be a lot of people out there that will never step off of their \\"Moral Highhorse\\" and watch it, and that is their loss, quite frankly. If you aren't one of those people, I have a feeling that you won't regret watching Breaking Bad.     ENJOY!!!
B004V6MWFU|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by Vedder's  solo work on the Into The Wild soundtrack, it was quieter yet still very powerful and really showcased his voice. Eddie continues along those lines with Ukulele Songs which is a nice change of pace for those moments when you need a break from the heavier guitars of Pearl Jam and would like to just chill out with some peaceful tunes. I like the fact that Eddie's solo projects seem to contrast a bit from his work with Pearl Jam, I look forward to the two of them coexisting for many more years to come..
B004K4AVAG|2.0|I bought this with the understanding it would be compatiable with mac and ipod i have yet to figure it out.???<br /><br />Amber
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Doesn't work on Moto Droid for no reason.  I can run PS1 games on it with little problems so there is no technical reason as to why Plants versus Zombies couldn't run on it.    Screw you Amazon, I will never be using your appstore now.
B001GQSY5K|5.0|It's good to cee this fill the screen on my ecto-plasmic SAMSUNG LCD television. Great colors, great as animae in the bed.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I'm sorry Popcap but I cannot let this slide. While Plants vs Zombies is one of my favorite games of all time, the graphics are quite fuzzy on Android and not nearly as high res as the ones on the iOS versions. The fact that there is an iPad version available makes the fact that this isn't optimized for tablets like the Xoom seem lazy on Popcap's part.<br /><br />Aside from the graphics issues and non-tablet optimization, the gameplay is still the same addicting zombie killing fun that this game is famous for. There's plenty of content and the game difficulty ramps up nicely, introducing you slowly to new features and getting you used to the functions of all the different plants. Even if it wasn't free I would still recommend a purchase.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Might be a great game, but the screen resolution doesn't fit my screen. It's squished to the left side of the screen. It'll get a better rating once that's fixed. Htc evo 4g.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Plants vs Zombies is just as much fun here as in any of its other incarnations, but its a lazy port. The file size is huge, and the end of level animation slows even high-end phones to a crawl. Grab it while its free.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|A previous reviewer said PvZ refused to install on his Xoom,which may scare some Xoom owners off.  Well it works fine for me and looks pretty good -- it fills the whole screen and plays in landscape mode.  The only issue I see is the graphics are a bit blocky on some screens, but overall a pleasant surprise.
0515123447|4.0|Mr Child came highly recommended by our parents so we decided to start at the top of the novel list with The Killing Floor. Child's storytelling and characterization of Jack Reacher did not disappoint but, while we are not delicate flowers by any stretch of the imagination, the gory details of the violence in the story seemed abrupt and borderline disturbing. While this aspect did a good job of further villifying the bad guys, we hope that it gets tamed down in subsequent novels. We were very pleased with all other aspects of the book.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Game is locking up.  Getting lots of Force Closes in the middle of levels.  Can get through one level at a time and that's about it.      I have a tablet with plenty of processor.  Shouldn't be this much drag in the game.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Good game. Slow loading, but smooth gameplay. Same basic mechanics as found in all other versions. Big fan of the original. Don't know what the graphics are like for the iPhone, but compared to the pc version, this is low quality (to be expected). Glad I didn't have to pay (thanks Amazon!) since I already own both the PC and PSN versions.<br /><br />Three quirks:<br /><br />1) No option to keep the screen on. If your phone goes to sleep, even for a second, it will have to reload the game. (easily solved via update)<br /><br />2) No resolution (widescreen) adjustment. Most android sets have wider AR than the iPhone's 3:2, or the iPad's 4:3. This seems like an iOS port. It'd be great if the image weren't simply stretched out to fit a widescreen. (not as likely to be fixed)<br /><br />3) Would like to see different graphics settings presets. Graphics seem to be deliberately lowered to be compatible on older phones. Would love a \\"high\\" setting for phones that can handle it. (not likely either)<br /><br />All in all, I can't complain too much, since it was free. I probably would have paid for it anyways. The quirks aren't deal-breakers, just minor annoyances. T-Mobile MyTouch 4g Froyo<br /><br />UPDATE: So after 1.5 years, (currently on version 1.2) PopCap still hasn't update the game to fix the issues I've outlined above. This is rather disappointing, especially considering issue 1 is so easily fixed (I'm an Android programmer myself). It is literally just 4 lines of code. (1. Instantiate a PowerManager object 2. Instantiate a full PowerManager.WakeLock object 3. Call the WakeLock's acquire() method when the game starts 4. Call the release() method when the game exits.) Still a fun game, and I can confirm it works on a Nexus 4 as well.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been playing this game all morning on my HTC Thunderbolt, and it is every bit as good as the XBoxvand PC versions of the game.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|As a collector of Blu-rays, I must say this is one of the best, if not the best addition I have made to my collection thus far.  In fact the only two which come close in terms of quality and sheer amount of content are \\"Apocalypse Now: Full Disclosure\\" and the \\"Alien Anthology\\"  Blu rays.  Blade Runner is not only one of the greatest films of all time, it is a sparkling example of how the idea of the 'director as the author' can create a profoundly different film.<br /><br />Of the FIVE copies of the film included, my personal favorite is the Final Cut, which is Director Ridley Scott's true view of what the film should be.  If you have only seen the theatrical version, or the 'director's cut' (which actually was edited by the studio, not Scott), you will feel like you are watching an entirely new film.  Finally, the 'workprint' is the most raw of the versions, but for fans of the film, it is a must watch so they can see the developmental process of the film.<br /><br />The second disk contains a 'making-of' Documentary, which is actually longer than the film itself.  This documentary is not like the featurettes you'll find on most films, but instead a full, comprehensive look at the making of Blade Runner and the lives of the people working on it.  Really the only film I could use as a comparison is 'Hearts of Darkness', which is a documentary on the making of Apocalypse Now (which is included in the Full Disclosure).<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fan of the film, considering the average price of a Blu-ray is around $20, the extra $10 goes a long, long way.  I can not recommend this purchase highly enough.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great game, nice time killer when your bored. I have an HTC Inspire on AT&T. I'm glad I rooted my phone so that I could allow unknown apps.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I have been waiting for this to come out for so long! This has all the core spirit of the PC version, only scaled down a little bit to suit the hardware capability of smartphones. It's a big file, sure, but who would not want a long experience with such a fantastic and addictive game? In my opinion, it's worth the space more than tons of crap games out there in the market. I give it a 5 stars. Highly recommended.
0316098329|3.0|The book was best in the beginning, it kept my attention. But before half way, it was not as interesting to me any longer.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Read a review that said the game didn't work on Samsung Vibrant but I tried anyways...works great! As people are mentioning about complainers and whiners who can't get it to work...your phone is probably outdated. And who cares if its 79mb? I've got over 8gb of storage.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|the game sounds like any of the other tower defense games, but the music video on preview is so BAD I had to down load it... I can't get that song out of my head...!!! MP
B0052UZIFA|1.0|boots see an hourglass, then boots me out to my homescreen, complete waste of time for G2 owners....this 20 word minimum review thing is bs....there met the requirements
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Finally on the Android.  Plays nearly perfect on the HTC Incredible.  At times the game slows down, but it doesn't hinder the gameplay that much.  A must own.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|As with everyone else... I have been waiting for this App to drop as well...  Unfortunately... it will not work on a Tmobile Comet... Click on the App and all you get is an hour glass and then a black screen... then the App crashes and freezes the entire phone... What a waste... and by the by.. why the heck does this App take up 79mb? That is absurd!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|All those of you on a tablet that complain are idiots. The description clearly says its not compatible with your device. still you install it amyway and then complain that it doesn't work. Please go away. It's a great game and you jist don't realize that because you ignored the description.
0345528581|5.0|I've been using the exercises and menus in this book for about two months.  I'm happy to say that the exercises have left me feeling stronger, with better posture, more energy, and improved focus.  One of the lower-star reviews have warned that these exercises will only make you \\"look\\" fit, but I respectfully disagree.  After using this book for a few weeks, I can run three miles straight through 90 degree heat, which I would not have been able to do before without getting sick or giving up.<br /><br />Two things you should know going in though:<br /><br />A) The exercise descriptions and pictures aren't perfect.  You may have to spend a whole two or three minutes looking up exercises from the book on YouTube to get a better idea of what to do.  The exercises in the book seem to use popular names that are easy to look up.<br /><br />B) I wouldn't do these exercises without really stretching and warming up first.  Simple stretches that you learned in middle-school PE class should work fine if you hold them for 15 seconds.  And you might want to walk down to the corner store or do some chores to get warmed up before doing body weights.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|gets to loading screen and just exits.   So dissapointing, waited so long for this to happen.    Hope they fix it soon.
0525951652|4.0|This saga covers several families, rich and poor, noble and humble, from England, Wales, Germany, Russia and the United States from 1911 through 1923. We start with 13 year old Willy Williams who is a Welsh schoolboy one day and a worker in the coal mines the next. We meet the evil capitalist tool managers and the wealthy aristocrat, Earl Fitzherbert, from under whose land the coal is taken. Within a few pages, a German nobleman (who is also a spy), his Austrian homosexual cousin and the Earl's sister join the mix along with a young housemaid from the local village.<br /><br /> The plot becomes more complex as a pair of Russian brothers is added, the rich son a U.S. Senator and a few others - including the most notable and historic figures of 20th Century Europe and America.<br /><br /> The few main characters inevitably become involved with every major event in Europe and the U.S. for a 12 year period. Oh yes, there's plenty of sex.<br /><br /> In short, we have one of those sagas were a unique set of characters happen to be perfectly situated to become involved with or at least close to every event of consequence.<br /><br /> This kind of plotting and storytelling can be pulled off - and Follett has done it before.<br /><br /> But he doesn't get away clean in this one: he just can't sustain the device over 975 pages, though he tries to break it up with lots of tepid sex scenes.<br /><br /> This is not a bad book: it simply isn't a great one. Follet wants to  cover too much territory, too many social trends. The period he's chosen was replete with historic events, not the least of which was World War I, the overthrow of the Tsar, the Bolshevik Revolution, the counterrevolution, Prohibition, Wilson's League Of Nations, women's suffrage and so much more.<br /><br /> While Follett has done an incredible job of plot structuring, the characters ultimately become shopworn. We don't have to wonder what Earl Fitzherbert's next evil deed will be - we know it, because Follett has become a slave to history and as night follows day, so much each development in his story.<br /><br /> It's an okay read because Follett is an excellent writer, but I frankly became more involved his genius at plotting instead of his characters. Not a bad book to keep around for idle time.<br /><br />Jerryay, so much each development in his story.     It's an okay read because Follett is an excellent writer, but I frankly became more involved his genius at plotting instead of his characters. Not a bad book to keep around for idle time.    Jerry
B0052UZIFA|2.0|i loved this game on steam and my old iPad, but it doesn't look great on the xoom and it lags at the end of every level for some reason... generally not a polished release (at least on honeycomb).
054531058X|5.0|This novel is unlike any I have ever read. It had me ensnared from beginning to end with my heart in my throat at the suspense. I love books that take you to scary places and doesn't shy away from making you care for a character only to run the risk of losing them.<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl living in a futuristic country known as Panem, which rose from the ashes of what was once North America. Panem is divided into 12 districts, each unique for its natural resources or local specialty. The districts surround a capitol city that is home to the Hunger Games, an annual contest where 12 to 18 year old boys and girls fight each other to the death on national TV.<br /><br />When the name of Katniss' little sister, Prim, is pulled from the thousands of names eligible to compete in the games, Katniss immediately volunteers to go in her place. Thus begins a harrowing experience for Katniss as she is sent to the capitol to unwillingly participate in a blood-thirsty spectacle that can result in her death. The purpose of the Hunger Games is to keep the districts in line and serve as a reminder that the capital has total control over the lives of its people. The districts live in perpetual fear of the governing body which uses terror, and starvation as tactics to keep its people in line.<br /><br />From beginning to end the suspense never lets up. It keeps building and building until only a few contestants are left and until the very end you wonder if Katniss will win. There were plot twists I never saw coming, tragedy I couldn't wrap my mind around, and a fascinating world that would remind you of Star Wars. I loved this book from beginning to end and I am looking forward to the sequel.
0812550706|5.0|From cover to cover, Orison Scott Card keeps you guessing as to every motive, every action and when you finally think you understand the motives, he introduces another layer of complexity. Not recommended for a light read, but definitely a must have for any book collection. I am currently reading the sequel and am still enthralled with this series.
B004HS1WPS|4.0|Stephen is so down to earth. He sounds like one of the guys. Nothing to hide, nothing to flaunt--just himself, you know?<br /><br />This book is not for the squeamish--he does get vulgar, it's the second half where the meat of writing is. The first is the building of his writerly magic; his experiences and struggles in life.<br /><br />It has helped me with my writing and gave me new standards in which to create: IE; creating my own writerly toolbox--priceless! The simplicity of using grammar; he will make it sound easy if this is your weakness.<br /><br />If you are looking for basic, black-and-white advice on writing, I recommend this book. Take notes as you read, or highlight your favorite passages. Whatever works for you!
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|This combo (CD/DVD) is more like a continuance of the original than a sequel. Once again featuring musicians around the world coming together for one purpose. This album has an exceptional track listing with covers of songs by, Bob Marley, John Lennon, Stevie Wonder, Rolling Stones and more, done with musicians and instruments found all over the globe. A perfect companion to the first and if you're not familiar with the first one do yourself a favor and order it as well.<br /> Peace Through Music.... join the movement!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|Ba Ba Ba BA BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA.<br /><br />Love the theme song, it's my ringtone.  It's hot, it's hip, it's Hawaii, so the scenery is beautiful.  Awesome show; a must get.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Error in findLibrary (returns null).  Perhaps not tested on 2.3?  Can't find a way to make it work.  Very disappointed in this.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I love the star wars series don't get me wrong, however, if you want me to buy this on Blu-Ray, lower that price a bit, and add some digital copies to the film.  I wish to have spent this amount of money and still be able to enjoy it on my iPod you know.  And since they are re-releasing Star Wars I in 3D, don't be surprised if they make a complete 3D saga set.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|This game was very fun until I got to around level 7 and it would lag and freeze my phone.  I have an epic 4g, it should not be doing this.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I have a LTE phone with unlimited data that gets 12+Mbps down and I have to use my capped 1.5Mbps wifi? Can someone please shed some light on this ridiculous restriction?
B004H1V5RU|4.0|I was very excited to see a harder version of the original Perplexus and immediately pre-ordered it.    Overall, it has been a much harder challenge to work through than the original puzzle. I feel that the biggest hurdle in completing this puzzle in one run will be luck more than anything else. Even after passing the same obstacle dozens of times there are still plenty of attempts where that same obstacle decides to throw my ball off. It has caused a few moments of frustration, but that's minor to the overall fun.    Luckily I have not seen any quality issues with my puzzle. Construction overall does feel a notch cheaper than the original. The outer shell and seam feel thinner and weaker, and there are a few spots where my ball sometimes gets stuck between the sphere and an obstacle. I have to shake or knock the ball to dislodge it.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Holy molybdenum these are some of the lowest resolution graphics I have ever seen on Android. wow. they just do not care. thisisnt even worth being free. so sad.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|installed and played fine on g2x, not so much on dell streak 7, the dell isnt on the incompatibility list, both devices are terga 2 and android 2.2
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This a great game to play and just waste time with. However, the file is also ginormous and the app doesn't install to the SD card directly as you would expect. I would love to see it default to the SD card in a future update.
1936719010|1.0|Hugely disappointed :([[ASIN:1936719010 Do the Work]] This is an almost exact copy (in different layout) of the Art of Work - Dont buy both!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Wanted to add that this works on my Droid X.  It says it works on some Droid X phones?  I don't know what that is all about, but it works.  Played for a few levels and everything seems to work well.  Looks pretty much like the DS version.  It's free today, give it a shot.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|when i saw the film in theaters this past Feb. i wasn't expecting Oscar  material(which obviously a lot of people were considering their mixed to   negative comments) so i wasn't disappointed when what i got was a entertaining  popcorn movie. i found John(Alex Pettyfer) a quite likable character) and   the fact Pettyfer is decidedly easy on the eyes didn't hurt. so when i received  the blu-ray disc last week i found it entertaining again. after all seeing Alex  P. in 1080p high definition defines the term \\"eye candy\\".     so my mixed reaction is of the blu-ray extras which are a mixed bag. so i ask  director J.D. Caruso what the ****** happened with the extras???     1.Alex Pettyfer is the star of the film and the title of the film is    I AM NUMBER FOUR. so why is the only making of short BECOMING NUMBER    6? i can't believe there was no behind the scenes stuff shot with with Alex     Pettyfer the star of the film but there is with a supporting character? i    remember seeing making of stuff on Youtube so why isn't it on the     bl-ray disc?    2.also i'm betting there were way more deleted scenes that centered on Alex's    character.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|If its free why does it need credit card info?  Some kind of tracking process that amazon must have to spy
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Why would a mobile app have Geo restrictions? This is not available in Europe. At meat make it clear immediately...
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I played through the Ipad version and loved it.  on the xoom, the graphics are low resolution and there were weird quirks from the start. name prompt had no label, popcap logo had artifacts around the edge and performance upon level completion was sub-par.  I didn't play it long but certainly would have been upset if I paid for the app compared to ios version. I really hope it gets some quality improvements. if you have nothing to compare to, people will love this game and be glad its on android.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Davvero il miglior gioco per android mai uscito. Ho amato la versione per PC e ora sono lieto di vedere che &egrave; stata portata anche su android!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I absolutely love this game and hope it will somehow work on my droid. With that being said, it seems like most android phones are listed under \\"the\\" phones this game will NOT play on, including mine. I give the game 5 stars, but the support a negative 5. Thanks for thinking of all of us other mobile users game creators. your game rocks, but you suck.      Addendum: I was able to download and install the game. However, I was unable to ever get the game to play. I do not know if there was a conflict with having the bulk of the game stored on sd (even though it shouldn't since it has the option to store on sd). I could not have this bulky game stored solely on the phone as it takes up like 79mbs worth of space. In any event, the game rocks on pc but absolutely sucks on my phone as it doesn't work. And it seems like most android phones are not supported. To you creators, why must you do this to us. Was there no way to allow us droid users to play as well. At least I didn't spend any money to find this out which I would have been pissed.
