159514188X|2.0|In this book, a high school student received a package containing several cassette tapes. The tapes were sent by a fellow classmate who recently committed suicide. They detail the events leading up to the classmate, who is also the main character's crush, committing suicide.<br /><br />I thought the basis of this story was interesting and had high potential of being a really good book. However, I was disappointed. The story is shallow. I found myself waiting for \\"the big break\\" in the story line, but it never came.<br /><br />I could not relate to the story line because Clay, the main character, was a constant nervous wreck and the rest of the characters were described very little.<br /><br />The story line wasn't really believable, either. Too many things happening at one time to one person that were so coincidental.<br /><br />May be a good read for a young teenager (13-15), but wasn't very good for me.

B005S9EKCW|1.0|I bought this movie on somebody's raving recommendation. Now, I realize the film is a MUSICAL, but after seeing this cast, I thought to myself, that doesn't seem to be a good concoction for singing voices. Russell Crowe? Hugh Jackman? I was actually going to give Anne Hathaway half a chance for crying out loud, with those giant, bulbous, intensely captivating pair of eyes she has, which to be completely honest, has always driven me wild. So, to start the movie... Poetic singing which is very difficult to follow. I tried to give it a chance to get to some regular dialogue when I could catch up on the movie plot. There is so little of it that I was unable to do so. Quite literally, 99% of the movie is singing, even in the most intense and desperate scenes. The singing, for the most part, was bad enough that one might not be able to focus on anything except for how bad the music was, and thus not able to follow the movie for anything. My family and I really tried to keep a patient and open mind, but after about a half hour, we were forced to give it up.<br />Anne Hathaway, you are a beautiful and very talented actor. Hugh Jackman, as far as male actors go, you are one of the best, but this movie was just not for me. I think you really need to have seen other renditions of the story, and have vast amounts of knowledge about it in order to get any enjoyment out of the movie. I don't think this movie is good for any musical newcomers, or the story of Les Miserables itself, newcomers. I know that is terrible english, but I think you get my point. I never have been a musical fan, even though I play musical instruments, and This movie certainly didn't help me to change my opinion.

B004W1GD4A|5.0|I give it a five stars right upfront just for the nostalgia. Atmospheric set, good script, good acting, so far.<br />I cannot yet tell if this has the same strength as the old, old, original Upstairs Downstairs, nor am I willing to compare it to Downton Abbey, which I love. But for starters, if you are my age and remember the original series ... ah ... you will feel the punch in your solar plexus.<br />Years have passed, in our world, as well as in this fictional world, and there is a bittersweet sense of stepping into the old house, clearing off the cobwebs, opening the curtains, the windows ... letting in the fresh air, taking a deep breath and then meeting with your old friends for a cuppa good English tea -- in flawless china cups and saucers, please! OK, and a slice of fresh baked fruit cake on a porcelain plate, nicely washed and ironed doilies and lace-edged linen hankies...yes am watching with misty eyes.<br />Just to see Rose in action again! What'n actress. Lively as ever, a little old of course, uhm, a lot old, but still more lady than the ladies she's served, quiet, reserved, classy .... I wonder if there will be more characters popping up from the old days?<br />I am open for surprises.

0553584537|3.0|There were many things I liked about this book, but in the end, I could not give it more than 3 stars because the entire plot was based around a scenario that was completely impossible. Much of the plot involved an elderly judge committing all sorts of horrendous crimes, including murder, to hide the fact that he was married to his half-sister. Everyone in the book managed to figure out that this had happened because the grandson had a rare genetic disorder, transmitted in an autosomal recessive fashion. However, grandparent's consanguinity has absolutely NO effect on the likelihood of a grandchild having an autosomal recessive disease. None. Zero. Absolutely no way. It only affects their own children. Unless their own children marry a relative, the odds reset to baseline for the next generation. DOESN'T ANYONE REMEMBER TENTH GRADE BIOLOGY?
B008ER9QKG|4.0|This is partly a review of the DVD and partly a review of Amazon's presentation of it.  It seems at first that this listing is for the DVD of the current (2010+) Met production, conducted by Levine and Luisi, but Amazon starts it off with a long description of the Bertrand de Billy production in Barcelona.  I read a lot of the customer reviews.  Some are reviews of the current Met production, others review the Barcelona production, or one conducted by Barenboim, still others seem to review the earlier Met production from the 90's, and some are so vague and general it is impossible to tell which production is referenced.  As if the Ring were not demanding and complicated enough on its own, these layers of confusion would make it impossible to make any rational choice as to purchasing this item, whatever it may be.<br /><br />I would also like to say a thing or two about the actual current Met production which (I think) may be preserved in this set.  My familiarity with it is from attendance at all four operas as presented in the Live in HD transmissions.  To me the outstanding feature of this Ring is the appearance of American singers in so many of the important roles.  It is probably the closest we have come to an American Ring.  All the American singers are wonderful, which is not to say that the Europeans are not great as well; there are just fewer of them than usual. Particularly outstanding among the Americans, in my opinion, were Eric Owens, whose Alberich could well be, vocally and dramatically, the best ever, and Jay Hunter Morris, whose bright, youthful, enthusiastic, and truly fearless singing as Siegfried brings the character to life in a way that is very appealing and also unique to his own particular personality and musical talents.<br /><br />As to the production itself, it has its moments, but overall the planks remain awkward, clunky, meaningless, distracting, and not, in my opinion, worth all the trouble and expense.  Over the course of the four operas things improved somewhat, as the planks were more and more kept still and out of the way of the singers, moving usually only during transitions and serving mainly as a screen for the excellent projections.  Watching the backstage videos of scene changes included in the transmissions, my impression was that the plank arrangement became less of a machine and more of a lifting project for stagehands as time went on.  During the first two operas it was sometimes very stressful to watch the singers trying to balance, hop, and slide on the planks as they also tried to sing, sometimes while the planks moved under them.  What was lost, for the most part, was any interaction among the people on the stage, as they struggled to remain upright and often found themselves isolated from each other on little plateaus or peninsulas or in little caves. The last two operas were much more effective, but only because the \\"machine\\" had been somewhat tamed and made less intrusive, with more reliance on the projections for story-telling.<br /><br />I see that there is still no complete CD version available.  Having seen the transmissions, I am waiting for a complete audio version as my souvenir of this production.  Listening to the current 2013 radio broadcasts, I would be very happy to have a recording of this season's version, with the singers probably more relaxed and more focused on singing instead of on not falling or being crushed. I have especially enjoyed another American singer, Mark Delavan, as this year's Wotan, and feel that his performance deserves to be preserved.as things improved somewhat, as the planks were more and more kept still and out of the way of the singers, moving usually only during transitions and serving mainly as a screen for the excellent projections.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The beginning of the book is off to a slow start.. kind of boring and didn't make me really intrigued. But I heard the book was amazing so I kept reading. Good thing I did. When this book got good, WOW did it get good. When you're at the meat of the story and you (and the characters) are beginning to put things together, it's so hard to put the book down. I was kind of disappointed with the ending, but that's no reason not to read this book. It's definitely a worthwhile read.

1401307450|3.0|I listened to RHCP a lot when I was in high school - around the time that Uplift Mofo Party Plan and Blood Sugar Sex Magik came out. I wasn't a huge fan, but I enjoyed some of the music.<br /><br />Fast forward to the mid-2000s, and here's my Anthony Kiedis story. I was working in live entertainment and worked a show with Snoop Dogg and the Chili Peppers. I was down in front of the front row. As the Chili Peppers took the stage, Anthony Kiedis' in-ear monitor wasn't working (at least, that's what I think the problem was) and he went over to the onstage soundboard, picked up the purse of one of the girls who was working the board and trying to fix his issue, and hurled the purse full-force across the stage. All of her makeup scattered across the far side of the stage, into the wings, and I remember thinking - poor girl, that was some expensive makeup (T. LeClerc powder, etc.) that's probably ruined now. I also thought, in regards to Kiedis, \\"huh.\\" I had seen all sorts of bad celebrity behavior at that point, but he seemed a little old and seasoned to be acting like that. RHCP played the show, during which the band members barely said a word to each other, or the audience - Flea tried to joke around a little but Anthony was having none of it - and then at the end of the show, Anthony stalked off the stage. I was glad I hadn't paid to see the concert, as I would have been disappointed.<br /><br />I like celebrity autobiographies and particularly enjoy rock star autobiographies. I liked The Dirt by Motley Crue, and Duff McKagan's book. Kiedis' book, however, is kind of a different animal than those others. There's a fair amount of rambling that's to be expected in any celebrity autobiography, but this book rambles A LOT. Kiedis comes across as a surfer-hippie with a lot of issues. He has some excellent insights and turns of phrase he employs in telling his story, but overall, I just kept feeling like \\"wow, this guy is a mess\\" all the way through the book.<br /><br />Some other reactions to the book:<br /><br />- Anthony has been in rehab, 12-step groups, and therapy and so I am sure at some point, someone has talked to him about the fact that his chaotic early childhood, and his dad treating him like a drug-using, sex-having adult running buddy at age 12, probably contributed to his drug addiction and his inability to commit to much of anything. However, Kiedis, in the book, talks about his life with his parents as if it was nothing more than a rockin' good time and something any kid would have fun doing. If you believe Anthony, the early introduction to drugs and sex, lack of supervision, lack of safety, and need to take care of his parent as if he was the parent didn't affect him negatively at all. Nowadays Blackie, Kiedis' father, would have been jailed for raising Anthony the way he did - it is the worst, and most irresponsible, of irresponsible parenting. It affected Anthony negatively, regardless of how he talks about it in the book. One thing I respected about both Nikki Sixx's autobiography and his sections of The Dirt was that he owns up to his own problems and tries to connect those problems back to his early life, while still taking responsibility for how he hurt himself and others while working out his issues. I didn't get any of that in Scar Tissue.<br /><br />- I didn't realize until this book that guys were also capable of doing something that I thought was stereotypical \\"girl behavior,\\" i.e., meeting someone and believing instantly that person is a soul mate, there's a connection there, they are meant to be together, etc. and then repeating that behavior with every person he/she meets. It was almost amusing, after a point - about every five pages of the book, Kiedis would describe meeting a new girl he felt this amazing connection to, and then in another five pages there would be a new girl and a new amazing connection. It did get a little tedious, and also a little creepy, once Kiedis reached his early 40s but thegirls stayed approximately the same age, around nineteen.<br /><br />- Overall, while I did get a sense of where Anthony's musical motivations come from, and could respect that the Chili Peppers really did set out to make music that was different and unique, I didn't get much of a sense of who Anthony was outside the drugs and the relentless (and I mean RELENTLESS) girl-chasing. The California surfer-hippie thing definitely comes through, but not much of anything else. I am not sure whether Kiedis is a deep person who lives an unexamined life because his fame and his money allow him to do so, or if he is a shallow person who has occasional flashes of deep insight.<br /><br />Overall, the book is worth a read but I still like The Dirt and Dave Mustaine's autobiography better. Pretty much all these rock memoirs have copious stories of sex and drug use, but especially in Mustaine's book, you get a much better sense that there is a real person behind the trappings of fame, which I didn't get from Scar Tissue.

1476733953|5.0|Saw this in a bookstore and figured, \\"Why not?\\"  So I ordered it on Amazon, of course. Didn't bother looking at the reviews or I would have had far higher expectations.<br /><br />I had just finished Among Others, which won the Hugo&Nebula last year and was a boring disappointment.  But, full disclosure, I am not nor will I ever be a 15 year old girl. And I have never liked Jane Austin.  Before that, I read City&TheCity, which was very good, but not great IMO. (I read it since we were about to see the stage play and I figured I should read the book first.  It was a good idea and both were worth the time.)  I read Blackout as well, which was a fun idea and an easy read, but could have been 100 pages shorter and written far better. Every time two characters met up, they gave a long \\"previously happened\\" recap.  Did not bother to grab All Clear.  The Windup Girl was excellent, but not something that sticks with you.  OK, you see where I am going...<br /><br />Ok, so I grab Wool before a trip to San Diego.  I like dystopian stories, so I figure this will help pass the time nicely before I settle into doing some work.  Well, you've read the thousands of other reviews, so you know that putting this down to ... do ... work ... was hard.  My advice: If you need to get work done on the plane, leave this book home.<br /><br />I doubt I'll shed any new light on this story by telling you either why this is a great read or why it'll stick with you, so I'll end by asking this:  Why did this book not win or even get nominated for any of the major awards?<br /><br />Easily the best sci-fi book I've read since Blindness.  Yes, 4 years ago.

It's also very motivating and gives a new perspective on how to view your body, its capabilities and how nothing is impossible.

The Corsair sound MUCH better than the Logitech.<br />Overall experience 3.5-4 Stars.<br /><br />Circa mid 2014...<br />I've owned these for more than two years.  They still work great.  I ran into an issue where I accidentally shorted out my usb receiver/transmitter.  That item can be replaced from Logitech or ebay.  Customer service was helpful.<br /><br />Purchased July 12, 2012...<br />Original review...<br /><br />* Battery charge lasts about 8 hours.<br />* Very comfortable for long term wear.  This is perhaps the best feature along with the volume control, mic mute on headset.<br />* Good software/drivers.<br />* Good with glasses<br />* Decent sound quality, though the bass is slightly lacking.  Expansive and \\"surround\\" but not as positionally accurate and crisp as better headsets.<br />* You have to choose a channel in your wi-fi router setup that won't conflict with the channel the headset uses, which takes some guesswork<br />* I used Logitech customer care to replace my usb dongle and they were very helpful.<br /><br />Above Average all-around PC headset for gaming.  Good upgrade from wired or wireless stereo headsets.  Price-point is fair for what you get.  But I replaced these with the Corsair, which for the same price are superior, though slightly less comfortable.

B007TNQ7EY|4.0|A great sandbox-world game with plenty of stuff to do in it. Many missions, a decently long story, and lots of side missions. The voice acting is not very good, and there is a lot of foul language and actions, as well as drugs, sex references and violence so this would not be a game for children.<br />  Three good things about the game:<br />  - Free roaming on the kindle is great, there's a large map with plenty to explore.<br />  - Lots of missions to keep you busy.<br />  - A wide variety of vehicles, weapons and clothes to add to your experience.<br />  There's a lot of great things about the game, however the controls and cover-system really make the game suffer. Especially when in a fire-fight and you can't target the person who want to. The cover is also frustrating as it is very limited and does nothing for you when you pop up to shoot, no accuracy increase or defends increase. This makes you rely heavily on body armor and the type of close you choose to wear, which takes away from some customization in gameplay.<br />  One thing Gameloft has finally managed to avoid in in-game purchases. In almost every game they make they try to milk the money from it using micro-purchases that are almost a necessity to gameplay. In Gangstar Rio however, it is easy to earn in-game credits and the are no micro-purchases at all.<br />  This being a very fun time passer, I would recommend it to someone looking for a sandbox world game as long as they can suffer through difficult controls and cover-system.

B002VXGW2E|5.0|My husband and I love watching cooking shows on Create TV:  Julia Child, Jacques Pepin, et al.  We decided to take a chance and watch this film.  It was intriguing to consider how Meryl Streep would portray and carry off the iconic Julia.  We were not disappointed.  This embodied the Joy of Cooking, to mix a title.  We were actually surprised how  much we liked it.  I actually tried the boeuf burginon recipe after watching Susan Goin's cooking lesson on the topic (sp?), and wow, it was beyond my expectations.<br />I had heard the movie was &#34;okay&#34; but actually it was 5 stars.
B0002IQOZA|5.0|This album was better and more that I expected. I can't wait to start playing it again next Christmas. Don't hesitate to purchase this. You will not be dissappointed. Excellent vocals and arrangments. I wish I could give it 6 stars.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|the price was right. the cast did a great job. the video and sound were awesome. a great addition to the play. worth having in my collection.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Since I have been doing lot of long exposure shots, I need this remote release cord to make sure my camera stays steady during long exposure shots.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This is the first fiction book I have purchased since having my Kindle.  I loved watching the movie on Little Women but have never read the book.  I love to crochet and when I do I put this book on and it makes time go by fast.  The person reading the book keeps me interested in the book.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|No better way to share your experience with others and connect with other people who have the same experience without all the Facebook hype.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series was great. Certainly a lite read but an entertaining one none the less. I would recommend to others.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo is the best I have always used it since I been an adult and have always been happy with it
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This single is fantastic, and I cannot wait for the album to release! It is funky, disco, and such a nice return to real house/electronic music instead of Skrillex and the rest of the dubstep genre.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|I just did not like it may be is ok for ten year olds. The end of the movie doe not satisfy.
B006WQLH7G|1.0|Downloaded the fire version, only to find out afterwards that it doesn't completely work on that device.  That should be disclosed in the description rather than having to hunt thru the faq's while trying (unsuccessfully) to set it up.
076115678X|4.0|Inexpensive and informative.<br />Content on hair care is sufficient and clear.<br />The methods provided does provide an outline for natural haircare, however the technique recommened may or may not work for everyone. I have 4c hair and did not obtain the results i was looking for.
B009NQLT0M|5.0|I replaced all my atom CPU fans. No more annoying rattle, and everything runs cool now. I like all the extra connectors that come in the package.
034580404X|5.0|James wrote beautifully moments that were pure and detailed the not so pure moments so perfectly, there were times I was reading in public having to cross my legs, hide my smile and continue reading privately. It will be difficult to find a series that excited me as much.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Since I've gone through a book that fast. Totally intrigued this psychology major's mind and entertained the girly girl in me.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|A must for Surfers movie collection!!!. Great views of BIG waves. A movie like this comes along just so often.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|This movie was so good and the all to real example of looking for freedom in the land of the free and maybe more. This is a very soulful movie about the young american today.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|This is a book well worth taking time to read.<br />It presents as a novel that is easy to read whilst covering complex realities of a relationship gone bad. The story begins with Catherine obsessively ensuring the doors and windows are locked when leaving and entering her home. She enjoys a social life with a group of young women after work and then she meets Lee. He presents as friendly and caring but over time it becomes clear that he is just &#34;a snake in a suit&#34;. and her life becomes controlled by Lee. He becomes abusive and when she eventually manages to escape and start  a new life in a new city she meets a psychologist who assists her in managing her obsessive compulsive actions.<br />The friendship  between Catherine and this new man in her life is dealt with  effectively both from a professional and  the love relationship that develops.<br />The author managed to present an easy to read story-line sharing the psychological damage caused by an abusive relationship and the implications of trying to cope with the resultant anxieties and stress through compulsive  obsessive behavior. Friendship and patience helped to build trust and love to grow again<br />Jo, RSA
B009NNG202|5.0|Wonderful movie, actors , etc. Really gpod. Enjoyed it's weirdness. 5 stars and a few more if I could..really liked everything about it .A must see!
B009EAO38C|5.0|We love it!  Our whole family loves to listen to the Piano Guys!  There is just something about these arrangements that make it such a captivating listening experience.  Our kids like to watch all their YouTube videos too!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I loved this book!! It took me all of 48 hours to read it! I've never finished a book that fast. And I work full time hours as a housekeeper!
B00AB7HESI|1.0|The game's premise is fun. The game is entertaining. But, asking me to pay more money in order to get updates or more than a few levels is ridiculous.
B00933JF74|1.0|the application would not install on my tablet - not something i would recommend to anyone with an android based tablet.
B00005ASIL|5.0|If you're a fan of Tull, this cd has it all. Trying to replace old viinyls and cassettes, this is a must- have for me.<br />It brings back great memories!

1594744769|5.0|I thought the prologue was a masterfully crafted metaphor.  I loved it.  I had picked up this book for my grandson.  As I read on it evolved into a fantasy for children/teens, lacking the denouements and symbolism of the opening, but I shouldn't have been surprised or disappointed, after all, I bought it as a young person's fantasy.  The mystical quality of the photographs and the vivid descriptions also make it better than most.
B008OOYALE|1.0|the application would not install on my tablet - not something i would recommend to anyone with an android based tablet.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|Seen it all before. Took forever to get going and was not very interesting or engaging. I would not recommend it.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great writing, phenomenal production, an all around great album- one of very few in this genre wherein one never feels the need to skip a song. I would put it up there with the best.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie was so heartfelt and full of real emotions we all feel! I really enjoyed it. Sweet and caring.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Cornwell does it again.  Never saw the ending coming.  Never guessed the villain.  Can't wait for the next story line
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I like anything by Diana Krall!  This CD does not disappoint!  Listen to it and you'll find out for yourself!
B0070Z4LLW|4.0|This movie did an admirable job recreating the events shown in the aftermath of the original. One of the best endings I have seen from any prequel leading you right into the beginning of the classic. Gory, twisted, creepy and fun; this movie had everything I look for in a creature feature. The original was a bit more captivating, but this was a little faster paced and still very well put together.
B003MC5N28|5.0|An easy read but a profound novel that will leave you thinking about the beauty in life for a long time.
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|Please keep this away from your kids or you may plot against the developer to keep them from making new apps.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is incredibly well written.  Very thought out and methodical storyline.  It was fantastic;  you can never guess what's going to happen next.

B009MF56GC|5.0|Awesome movie!
0307730697|5.0|This is a well written, fast read. The story is of a man who pulls himself out of addiction and homelessness, and rises to be one of Americas most elite warriors. It is a very inspiring and emotionally moving tale.
B004WE01YA|5.0|This is a timeless story that is great for kids of all ages.  We have watched this many times and have had not problems with it.
145210655X|3.0|This is not a story. It's a collection of single page comics. Most are not very funny(at least for the 5 adults a showed it to), but the illustrations are well done. My 4 year old son likes this book, so it's not a total waste.
B001PPLKI0|5.0|I love this cd.  The songs are beautiful.  Elvis sanf these songs with feeling and it shows.  This is a wonderful addition to ahy gospel library.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It's nice I can walk all thought the house with my headset on. Great for conference calls and just listening to music.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I love this movie.  It is great for children of all ages.  It arrived quickly and well packaged.  We have watched it a number of times and have had no issues.
0440244412|5.0|*******************SPOILER ALERT**********************<br /><br />This book was amazing. I feel like I'm saying that at the beginning of all my reviews for this series. I adore MacKayla. That girl has been through so much, she has died and been reborn as a new person, figuratively, of course. She has been to hell and back, literally. She has survived things that would have destroyed a lesser man. She still managed to rid the world of evil, contain it within herself, and find unconditional love. She is one of the most well rounded heroines in any of the books that I've read. She started off as a spoiled little princess and was molded into something much more... ferocious, yet loving. She is kind, she is gentle, she is a killer, she can destroy the world with a single thought, yet she doesn't. She creates. She lives. She loves.<br /><br />And Barrons.... Let's talk about him for a moment. He is so....complex. I've loved him and hated him in these books. My heart broke for him in these books. He is such a dynamic character. I love how the story gradually unfolds and we learn who he is and his past. His son....... oh my. That's just..... so sad. I am enamored. I felt so many different emotions within these books. I was sad when this ended because I feel like this is the end of Mac and Barron's story. Yeah, we get more, but aren't they about other people? I love Mac and Barrons. They are so completely different, but so alike. Then again, aren't we all who find that one love that we cannot live without. That one love that we will destroy the world for. That one love that will exist no matter what. &lt;3 Phenomenal series. Phenomenal book. Phenomenal author.<br />Reviewed by Ashley E. of FaeBooks
B001FVV2X2|4.0|The story line is above average.  The acting and interaction between the players I find funny and makes me want to watch more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.I play it like every single day.it is so look fun. And it's a look addicting. You should play it. You'll love it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had never read anything by this author, and was almost going to put is down because it seemed slow and boring in the beginning.  I was however pleasantly surprised when the story finally picked up to a faster pace.  I wold recommend this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|So addicting you can't stop  I can't wait for the next room I feel  great that I figured it out keep going till you get it look everywhere
B00C5ZORES|5.0|This album is everything you already love about Fall Out Boy: high energy, well crafted songs, kind of a punk pop, and this time they added some edge, particularly with the guitar. Lots of fun!
B00005JLF5|5.0|I gave this series 5 stars  because i ordered it, got it fast, at a good price, and now i have all the episodes of a very hard to find series, i can't find it on any stations in the town i live in, so check it out on streaming video, or download an episode, or do what i did, purchase the whole series on DVD from Amazon so you can watch again, and again, i would recommend all Trek fans to get all your Trek shows and movies here.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Great Free App !!!  Easy to use - Love the added bonus of the local weather and temperature feature !!!!!  Thanks to the creator of this handy &amp; useful app for the Kindle Fire !!!!!
B005HEVBGG|5.0|The next generation is on quite a bit in my town, but Voyager no longer is, not even on cable so it was good to be able to see this show again, after a few years. So if your a Trek fan like i am, add this to you video library, to watch when you want. The price is right and the quality unbeatable, so spend some time with old friends.
B001EN71CW|5.0|My Favorite &#34;gone too soon&#34; series ever!  Figures that Fox would cancel such a good show after only 14 episodes.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I voted 5 stares because it allowed me to pick which episodes i wanted to watch, so i paid the small price to add  them to my video library, i would say to all Trek fans, or any new fans, download or streaming video an episode now, you won't be sorry, the quality is excellent. Amazon rocks.
B001NXDIMK|5.0|terrific and exciting.  acting is excellent.  story line is complex and holds interest.  can barely wait to watch the other seasons

B005COO1X6|1.0|I normally like Stephen King but this book went nowhere.  You never knew anything about the creature or how it got here.  I don't think I would recommend this book to any one.  Waste of my money
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|i love this movie, everyone should own it. definitely really fun and nostalgic. one of the best cartoons of my childhood.
B0052AC8C6|5.0|This is a &#34;Family Friendly Movie!&#34; If you were debating on watching it, I encourage you to do just that! Full of laughs. Enjoy!!
B000CNE092|5.0|i love this movie, everyone should own it. definitely really fun and nostalgic. one of the best cartoons of my childhood.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I haven't had much time with this game but I think once I can spend some time playing it I might like it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|i love this movie, everyone should own it. definitely really fun and adorable. one of the best cartoons ever made.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Peter Jackson & Co. did it again.  I loved the movie. I missed it in the theater so never got to see it in3D. Will make the time to see the next movie in the theaters
B00005JKDR|5.0|i love this movie, everyone should own it. definitely really fun and adorable. one of the best cartoons ever made.
B004MKLRQA|5.0|This book is truly amazing. The fact that its told by a young boy who experienced a conflict of this kind and lived to tell about it is a blessing. From a globalized and feminist lens point of view, its sad that most of the woman that Beah talked about were rapped, killed, or used as slaves by rebel forces to carry supplies and cook. Women in these parts of the world don't have much choices in life. Its still a mans world and women are for breeding. I tried to imagine how I would feel as a mother in Beah story to never see your children again or to watch your child be forced to kill an innocent person just to save his own life. The fact that it happened and is still happening around the world is disturbing. We as people need to put an end to conflicts like this and strive for a better future. This might not be happening in the U.S or Europe but who's to say that it could never happen? It goes to shows that there are conflicts world wide and there is not enough regulation to keep young children out of these conflicts.<br />I recommended this book for future classes, and young teenagers who are spoiled rotten in this time of age because the book makes you realize what challenges life can make you endure and how our life style and life conflicts are nothing compared to what beah endures. Beah tells of one of his experiences with wild pigs and how they tried to eat him. A group of wild animals trying to eat you at 12 years old and alone in a jungle with no food... Truly an amazing  story.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|i love this movie, everyone should own it. definitely really fun and nostalgic. one of the best cartoons of my childhood.

B00CEIGYAG|5.0|With Roger Niles plucking the strings and Pharrell cooing, this song is infectious as One More Time. Get Luck is a Great Song.
B0001I561E|5.0|i love this movie, everyone should own it. definitely really fun and nostalgic. one of the best cartoons of my childhood.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I really liked this book . The plot was relatively well developed. Then characters were for the most part believable, although getting drunk and married within 24hrs was a little far fetched. It we a nice little read. I would have liked to have had a baby born though.
B00B22IJXK|5.0|It is real but sincerely imaginary. It gives off warmth through its use of colors but not overly done. It is both simple and complex which reflects its contradiction beauty.
B004WR125O|5.0|This is a simple, worthwhile upgrade for compatible Onkyo receivers.<br /><br />I chose to utilize the rear USB port on my TX-NR717 and have had no problems with it working.  I even have it surrounded by other wireless devices(TV, Blu-ray, Xbox, Wii, AppleTV)in my setup that haven't prevented it from working.  I will admit that the signal strength is indicated at 50%, but that hasn't been a problem because I'm only streaming Pandora and modifying volume levels, zone activation, etc.<br /><br />I like that I can leave the receive on network standby mode & turn it on elsewhere in the house through the associated iPhone application.  Unlike other reviewers of the iPhone app, I have not had any crashing problems.  Perhaps this is because I chose to setup the Onkyo receiver with a fixed IP address on my network rather than have it utilize DHCP.  It only makes sense to me to limit variables to ensure that there is constant connectivity.<br /><br />Hope this helps!
B0016BP0PW|5.0|This has both a Great Story along with Great Music. Some better than the Beatles, some not. A Must See!!
B001XCWPAM|4.0|Yes believe it or not this was the first time I had seen the Bourne movies. I like Matt Damon and enjoyed the films. Not my favorite but very good action movies for the thinking viewer.
B009XTF8JM|5.0|Great Story, well acted, Horror Fans must see this!!!!!<br /><br />This will be a Classic Horror Movie.<br /><br />I ordered this Movie.
B0064MT1U8|4.0|I like the actors in this film.The plot is cute but gets serious at times.All in all an enjoyable film.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|This is a Cult Classic Movie.!!!!<br /><br />Everything about it is Excellent.  Acting, Story, Action.<br /><br />This is a Must See Movie!!!!
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the Potter movies.I own the whole set and I am an adult.I don't think these are just for kids. This one made me cry.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|I wasn't sure what this movie was about, but i'm glad I ordered it. Its based on a true story of a family that was caught in the sunami in asia. The movie is well made the graphics of the water and debris is chilling. The family caught in the water was so realistic. Watch it.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Excellent movie for history buffs.. Great acting by both Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee Jones and the rest of the cast.
B00C4QWDYY|5.0|I just checked out one episode last weekend, to see what all the hoopla was about.....I mean, how could you possibly have any story-line in a zombie movie, please?!  Needless to say I was hooked from the first 10 minutes of season one, flew straight through season two before the end of the weekend, and have had many sleepless nights this week to complete season three. they absolutely did not disappoint.  The non-stop action, heart-wrenching stories of human survival against all odds - including absolute living hell on earth have made me a Walking Dead-Head to the core!!
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Love this movie. Great acting by Helen Hunt, John Hawkes and William H. Macy. Definately oscar worthy of the nominations. Should have won best oscar for Actress and Actor.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Same gameplay that if you've ever played a  game for this developer and too many items are cost real money
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|... as a multi-layered skykraper ... this work emcompasses the diverse expertice and musicianship this ARCHITECT has deliverde in his unique and diverse type of musical structures ... as one wonders throughs its several floors / levels  we get undiscover the mystery of this at first laberintic output ... but with further touring thru its many rooms ...we discover a palette of divers stages ... styles ...and rooms plenty of layers accomplished by this artist/architect .... once more hats off to Sir David Bowie ... thanks for so much enduring edifice.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel does not dissapoint, yet again he plays a strong character with intensity. He captures the full personality and embodies a very believable character.
B00C32R64G|5.0|If you love all that is Volbeat, you will not be disappointed.  All of the highs and lows are here, but amplified.  So far, my personal favorites are &#34;The Nameless One,&#34; &#34;The Hangman's Body Count,&#34; and the great cover of Young the Giant's &#34;My Body.&#34;  I also find it fascinating and rewarding that, in a world in which audacious theme records almost always fall flat, Volbeat does them over and over and, because of the wide range of styles that they do well and influences that inspired them and that they honor, they consistently hit on all cylinders with each one.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|While people have questioned the acting of Jamie Foxx, I thought that all of the actors did a great job, especially that of Leonardo DiCaprio. This is definitely not a movie for those who aren't able to handle seeing lots of shooting. It reminds me of an old western film with a modern spin. I appreciate how the issue of slavery was handled sensitively yet the comedic portions were respectful. While I wouldn't want to purchase this movie due to the graphic images, it was a thoughtful movie and very entertaining.
B004CYKZZA|4.0|Pro: Great Sound ; Easy to use: Great for Skype ; Fits well and very comfortable...<br /><br />Con: Makes clicking noise feedback on Team Speak 3.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|With much more addicting gameplay and improved graphics, Temple Run 2 makes the original game look like a classic Gameboy platformer (in a good way). TR2 is guaranteed to be one the best well developed and most irresistible games of the decade! It's a 5 star rating for me:).
B000050HTO|5.0|This remastered collection is just wonderful. I can finally hear the words clearly!! Dyloan is a true master of the age, especially his early works.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Love the period in history, the costuming, the upper crust attitudes and interaction with the common folk. Seems each class had its hierarchy.  Found it very interesting and entertaining!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Peter Jackson does it again!  He brings the Hobbit to extrodinary life just as he did the Lord of the rings.
B00A0NOF7G|3.0|This is a quick undemanding book that does not try to be anymore than what it is, a fast paced story with lightly sketched characters that just gets on with the plot. A straight forward plot with no attempts at cleverness. A good book if you are recovering from illness or are stressed.
B00571F26Y|3.0|I got a lot out of his writing about how we react to Wheat and the difference in the wheat of today from years ago.
0385349947|5.0|One of the most revealing parts of this book (for me) was the \\"Acknowledgments.\\" It takes nearly four pages to describe the staff it took to help Sheryl Sandberg write this best-selling book. In addition to her editor and others at the press, Sandberg had a paid \\"writing partner,\\" several professional researchers, technical staff who created a virtual \\"lean-in community,\\" as well as many personal friends and connections poring over outlines and drafts of chapters. This list reads like a name-dropper's special: Gloria Steinem (dear friend and trusted advisor for the past six years), Ariana Huffington, Oprah Winfrey (who frequently texts Sandberg), Larry Summers, Mark Zuckerberg (her boss). No wonder she has been criticized for taking her privilege for granted; readers can be forgiven for thinking they too could write such a book with all that help, just as many have argued that Sandberg's wealth insulates her from the struggles that many ordinary working people face, making her advice inapplicable to the real lives of her readers.<br /><br />But the book's success belies this criticism. \\"Lean In,\\" as it turns out, feels urgent and meaningful to women (and men) across the social spectrum, and this is what has made it a best-seller. This is a feature of the authentic and confidential style in which Sandberg shares anecdotes about her own trials, triumphs, and insecurities. We learn about the time her kids exhibited signs of head lice on the ebay plane traveling to a business conference (and how she desperately covered this up), about how she concealed leaving work early to be home for dinner with her family, about how she lied about the sounds of her breast pump that were audible on a business call, about how embarrassed she was as a child about the reputation she had in the family of being \\"bossy.\\" Sandberg's frankness about her own insecurities and even her flubs both on the job and as a mother make her struggles feel powerfully like every woman's struggles--as she encourages us by her example to be frank about what we need to succeed as working women and as mothers.<br /><br />Sandberg is also insightful about the paradoxes of seeking the equality of the sexes through emphasizing the specific challenges of being a woman, and she reaches out as much to men as to women with affection and respect for the double-binds in which the male sex also finds itself. She finds a way to be a proud feminist without claiming unique moral virtue for women or denigrating the choice to stay at home with the kids, a respectable choice that many women make. Her impassioned plea is for men and women to join together so that those who choose to \\"lean in\\" to their careers will have a genuine choice to make and those who choose to \\"lean in\\" to other parts of life can feel proud of their own contributions to the human family. Within that context, her generous acknowledgment of the professional village it took to help her write the book feels like one more example of the team spirit that makes this book so inspiring.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I could not wait to read the story on how they got him. Good read and excellent ending. Proud to be an AMERICAN...
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who loves reading as much as I do.  I can zip through a 500 page book in no time. And this one, my oh my, did I get my teeth into it.  Every page brought me new joys as I traveled through the adventure of....well, you will have to read it to find out.  Trust me, this is a wonderful book.  And actually one I have read quite a few times....it is that good.

B00BI6SVCE|4.0|I was one of those long-time Iron & Wine fans who was left a little confused by thier (his) previous effort, Kiss Each Other Clean. It was a long run into left field territory for a performer who'd made his name on acoustic guitar and hush-hush murmurings, and while it did have a few standout moments and some reasonably catchy jams, it just wasn't the Iron & Wine I knew.<br /><br />Having read the early reviews of Ghost On Ghost, I was going into this expecting more of the same...but I'm happy to report that is not entirely the case.<br /><br />Make no mistake: this is still a full band effort, far from the stripped-down solo tracks of yore, but to echo the sentiments of previous reviewers this album feels far more relaxed. The entire thing has a bit of a \\"swingy\\" vibe to it. That's not to say it's lounge music for an evening at the martini bar; rather, it just feels more \\"loose\\" in the arrangements, allowed to sway a bit more. Production is less painfully slick, the horns are less glaring, the random synthesizer swoops and boops are almost entirely gone, and the whole thing just feels less frenetic and less dense.<br /><br />It almost feels as if Sam HAD to take that leap into Kiss Each Other Clean territory in order to get it out of his system, see how far he wanted to push his music, then reign it back in a little for this effort.<br /><br />Also, as a pleasant aside for folks such as myself who are as much fans of Sam Beam The Wordsmith as they are of Sam Beam The Musician, the lyrical imagery this time around takes a turn back toward Iron & Wine's classically evocative style. Maybe it's the subject matter of the album: Ghost On Ghost plays as kind of lovers' travelogue, with a pair of wayward souls winding their way around, in, and out of various times and places in each others' lives. That lends itself well to some poetic insights into love, loss, absence, dependence, heartache, joy, responsibility, and all the subtleties (both pleasurable and painful) that our affections open us up to.<br />This is a VERY lyrically-dense collection, although they sometimes get lost a little in the mix. You'd be well served reading along with the liner notes on the first couple of listens.<br /><br />All that said, I'm quite happy with this album.<br />The era between Our Endless Numbered Days and The Shepherd's Dog still remains my most magical Iron & Wine period to date, and while Ghost On Ghost doesn't threaten to dethrone those titles, it does pose as a refreshing next step in the band's evolution.
B004HWT6DO|2.0|The movie was a little bit better than a documentary.  Actually I have seen better documentaries. I bought it only because it was a &#34;required watch&#34; for contract law.  To be fair, the movie did serve it's purpose for the class.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Did really like it the first time I saw it, but then I watched it and and liked it a lot more.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|After three or four days while reading this, I began to feel claustrophobic. That's how Howey's detailed and realistic portrayal of life in an enormous subterranean silo made me feel. Now on to Shift!
B00BI745AA|2.0|I did not care for the show at all. I think shows like this are much better and more believable with actors we are not use to seeing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have loved this game from the second I played it on a borrowed iPod, and it was the first app I downloaded on my new tablet.  The best game ever!  It's also the easiest way to waste an afternoon.
B00BFV1JZI|1.0|The last 2 or so chapters - ruined the series for me. I was going to detail why, but it'd be a spoiler.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is much more exciting and fun than the original.  Better look, better response time, better everything.  I also love how easy it was to pick up and play - day two and I've scored over 2 million points.

0792839749|4.0|On of my grand children said they would like to see the movie. I ordered it for them to watch they really liked it
B005LAIIFS|5.0|This is a cute movie and the Toy Eggs are fun as well. My family loved it and it was a hit at Easter.
B002CLBJPK|4.0|The movie was good my wife liked it better then I did and the grand kids thought it was great
B008B3GP2A|5.0|If you like Maroon 5 then you will like this album.  Their songs that aren't playing on the radio right now are really good, a few upbeat, a few ballads.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I had a problem with the cable that came with my Kindle.  Tech support gave me the ability to get a new one at no cost.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Loved the movie, love the soundtrack.  You won't regret buying this at all. I recommend this if you liked the movie.
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|I thourghly enjoyed the story within a story. For days after I finished reading the book, I wondered about Pi thinking his story could have been true. It was a believable story.So sad when the last connection to his family melted into the jungle. Yet we were happy for him by the end of the whole story.
1433502410|5.0|I chose this Bible on the recommendation of a trusted friend. I wanted a gift for a friend who had just commited his life to Christ. In perusing the Bible I determined this one was written in a style that a new Christian could understand with notes to help explain and give light on the verses.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|A different way of looking at business development and management. Keeping it simple is always a good basis for business operations.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was very popular with my friends so I had to see what all the buzz was about. I did enjoy reading it.
B00BKBCF38|4.0|Swedish band Ghost made some noise in the metal community with their debut album Opus Eponymous (2010) which saw a lot of comparisons to bands like Blue Oyster Cult and Mercyful Fate with a throwback to a vintage 70's sound. I played the band's debut rather heavily since and I really got into their sound and image. Now Ghost return under the moniker Ghost B.C. (due to legal issues) with their second album Infestissumam (Hostile, in Latin). If I was to compare Infestissumam to Opus Eponymous very quickly I'd say this one is a little more layered, more complex, longer songs, has heavy keyboard use, isn't quite as raw or maybe not quite as catchy but is probably a more consistent album overall and on this one there is no filler (not that the first one had lots of filler but this on Infestissumam I like all of the songs). There's plenty to like and with their second release Ghost prove that they are all about great songs and musicianship and that they didn't just strike luck with the debut which to me, validates the buzz they've been generating among the Metal community and why I like this band to begin with.<br /><br />''Per Aspera Ad Inferi'' sounds a lot like ''Con Clavi Con Dio'' from the first release and it's song #2 as well. It's a strong, heavy song and is just as good as CCCD if not more, in some ways they're similar but this one I find a little more effect.ive. The two songs are similar yet different. ''Secular Haze'' is something, it's totally different from what Ghost has done before. This one is a longer, more structured song and keyboard driven. Very dramatic and I was surprised that it was the single of the album and initially I didn't like it very much. Yet with each listen it grew on me and now I really like it. ''Jigolo Har Megiddo'' is an upbeat, energetic rocker that is seriously catch, just listen to that organ harmony during the chorus. I really like this song. ''Gouleh-Zombie Queen'' is one of the most interesting song because it's split in two and on the first part they play a slow, ballad type song (not power ballad, but ballad) which you would probably not expect out of them. Then the band rips into Zombie Queen, surprising the satan out of the listener and it has a surfer music, Beach Boys vibe going on yet its still unmistakably Ghost and it rocks. ''Year Zero'' starts out with these powerful evil chants that will later become the chorus of the song and the way it's integrated is pure Ghost. It's one of my favourite songs of the album and was the second song revealed on the band's website. ''Boody And Blood'' is easily one of the most memorable riffs here and it grabs your attention and it has really has that vintage vibe I came to love from this band.  ''Depth Of Satan's Eye'' keeps the album going strong, without missing a beat.  One of the catchier song here with a pop-oriented chorus, it will get you singing along and will get stuck in your head like Ghost is known to do. Has that eerie evil vibe and is my favourite song so far. ''Monstrance Clock'' is heavy, yet has that really catchy pop-esque chorus that was present on many of the songs featured on the debut that was a trademark of theirs. It's undeniably catchy and the vocals melodies are absolutely great a terrific way to end what has been a great album. It's probably the catchiest and one of my top songs for this album.<br /><br />The deluxe edition has a 24 page booklet and 2 bonus tracks. The booklet has cool evil ancestral looking pictures throughout. Ghost covered a Beatles song on their debut for the Japanese import ''Here Comes The Sun'' and One of my favourites on Infestissumam is the bonus track ''I'm a Marionnette'' a cover of the song by the Sweddish band ABBA. It was the second song I heard from the album and I felt in love with it. The urgency in Papa Emeritus II's vocals, Dave Grohl's pounding drumming and the lyrics... This was a perfect choice for Ghost and when it was announced in 2012 that they would be covering it, I could already see myself loving it.<br /><br />The more I listen to Infestissumam, the more I enjoy it and with each repeated listen I find more to like. Opus Eponymous was instant for me. I found that when I went away the songs kept coming up in my head much like the first album did, This one is a bit more layered and complex which is great because they could have just handed in an album that sounded just like the last one. I was a little worried that the album wouldn't be able to measure up to the debut which I played a LOT and it does not disappoint. This one feels a bit more like a concept album with the longer pieces and they seem more connected whereas the debut had more individual songs that stood out (maybe the next one will bring the best of the two?). To me this would be a strong, 4 out of 5 stars, I really enjoyed it and it's an excellent follow up, no sophomore slump here at all. They brought that vintage vibe and sound back to Metal with a twist of theatrical and horror and I can't wait to see what they come up with next.ready see myself loving it.<br /><br />The more I listen to Infestissumam, the more I enjoy it and with each repeated listen I find more to like.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My husband and I started watching this and have been addicted ever since.  I has drama and comedy all rolled into one show
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Not only are these boys great eye candy but the show just keep getting better. When you think they cant come up with new ways to destroy the world the writers keep it alive lol. Thanks for another great season i look forward to season 9
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Really good read. Lots of character development and new plot points revealed. I can't say enough about Martin. I think he is a great author. Off to dance with dragons.
B004GEB9UQ|4.0|Cordian makes a compelling case for changing your eating habits. I'm not sure I buy all the &#34;science,&#34; but I've been doing a reasonably strict version of the Paleo diet for 13 weeks and I've lost 16 pounds (I wasn't huge to begin with, so now I'm pretty much at my goal weight). I do also feel better, so whether our Paleolithic ancestors ate this way or not, I don't really care. I will continue to eat this way for the foreseeable future.
1608871452|5.0|I wanted this SO BAD! I bought it with the Amazon Gift Card  I won in a logo designing contest. Worth every penny. If you're into Supernatural or you know someone who is then this is the pentultimate gift to give or get. It has all kinds of goodies inside, postards, trinkets, maps. It's sort of a compilation of all the Season Companion books but with a lot more information and pictures and just everything. On top of that it's just a beautifully bound book anyone would be thrilled to own. Get it. Get it now.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|This is a cute book, with cute characters with an interesting plot  this is not what you would call great literature but the story is cute and the characters are likable. Easy to read and it goes quickly.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Could not put down. Could not put down.  Great book. Great story. I hate writing reviews where you have to write so many words.
0307346617|5.0|Very intereating take on an over done subject. Story telling was well done, characters were diverse ans relatable. The zombies were horrifying, but the ending was satisfying and reasonable. A very good read.
0345803485|1.0|I'm 1/3 of the way through and thought I would read some of the other reviews to decide if I was going to continue reading it.  I kept telling myself maybe it will get better. I'm really disappointed because I thought this was going to be a good book from all the hype about it. At the very least sexy but it's not. The reviewers that talk about it being written by teenager - that's what I felt like too.  The writing is atrocious and the storyline ridiculous.  Should've taken a chug of beer every time the word 'delicious' was used and maybe it woeld have been a little more entertaining.  At this point I'm going to cut my losses and abandon the book. And like some of the other reviewers on here I'm not a literary snob... I wouldn't waste your money.  Don't say you haven't been warned.
B008P76VP8|5.0|The quality of the disc is superb with first-rate picture AND two equally effective sound tracks.  The performance is simply sublime.  This disc is not to be missed!  Excellent packaging and swift service!
B001VLXNLU|5.0|Amazing storytelling...good vs. evil....how can you not like that? These books are page turners, and you get attached to the characters.
B002VWNID6|5.0|This makes the classic story of Robin Hood come alive!  We all enjoyed it very much!  We highly recommend it!
B00947N6D8|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for this movie I had my doubts.  But with such bug name voices such as Hugh Jackman and Chris Pine I had to watch it.  Throughout the movie I could not help but laugh and aw and the right moments.  This movie is not only great for kids but for adults who enjoy a cute movie once in a while.
B008602KQI|4.0|watched it a 2nd time, and still as good as first time.  If you haven't seen it I recommend it.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|I highly recommend this CD for any Bonamassa fan and any other listener that enjoys soulful blues or R + B. This is one of my favorite CDs.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This is the best book of the series so far. So much action happens that it is hard to believe at times. The first half is actually quite slow, but once you get to a certain high point, it never comes down.
B00AQ7FEGM|5.0|(Vendor's customer service was great on this product)  I refer you elsewhere on Amazon for hundreds of detailed reviews of this incredible documentary.  It could not be made today for many reasons:  Many eyewitnesses are dead, for one thing, and PC today tends to refuse to look evil straight in the face or tries to psychoanalyze it.<br /><br />Of all the WWII documentaries, this is by far the best.  In part because of its scope, scale, visuals, and the perfect tone of its narration.  But mainly because of the script which is like a great screenplay, powerfully and engagingly telling you stories with a mere 2,000 words per episode.<br /><br />This is the sort of thing to watch alone so your reactions are your own, not modified by anyone else's.  You will learn something about yourself doing it this way.  Especially the \\"Genocide\\" episode (which should be shown to every high school senior in the world).  If you aren't traumatized and teared up at the end of Genocide, you either weren't paying attention or have some growing to do.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I bought this book when I got caught up in all the hype around when the movie released. I read about halfway through it and it just never grabbed me. A good book for me is something that I lose track of time while reading. I was finding myself just forcing to finish a set number of pages each night just so I good get through it.<br /><br />I never ended up seeing the movie either. I might try to revisit the book at another time. It just wasn't for me.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best shows I've ever watched. It always keeps me on the edge and I feel so involved.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I was going to take a break between Book Three and Book Four, but after the ending of Storm of Swords, there was no way I was going to stop.<br /><br />Feast for Crows is still as amazing and gripping as always, but after the roller coaster of Book Three, it does feel a bit slower.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I am forcing myself to finish this book...i do not enjoy the format and it is just not holding my attention
B008B11RLQ|5.0|Overall the product deserves 5 out of 5 stars because of the price. Each of the twenty cd's come in a simple slip case (you just slide the cd in and out on the right side of the case). The cases for the individual cd's are nice quality and are copies of the original albums. The cd's are generically printed black with the title of the cd printed in silver. There are a few cd's that have extra tracks either at the start of the cd or at the end that aren't listed on the packaging. Great sound quality. Once again, overall this product deserves 5 out of 5 stars for the low price.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I read all of her books in sequence while off work last year.  This one is finally a improvement over the last few. I am not sure she wrote it though, maybe a ghost writer involved here. But I can support that too.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Historically inaccurate. I was bored after 5 minutes and turned it off soon after. This was the worst movie I have seen and unfortunately purchased and shipped for a high price based on the good reviews.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This was a page turner.  Brought in so many feelings an emotions in a very funny and sweet way.  I have told everyone about this book. It stayed for me for several days.  Great ending.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The music was great, the actors suberb, a real tear jerker.  It is a movie that can be watched over and over again.
B008742O32|4.0|Product works exactly as described.  Had it installed and working in not time.  Company seems to know what they are doing.
B004WGIXX4|5.0|very funny and good movie highly recommend to my friends. Loved the way it ended and would watch it again.
0142419850|5.0|I've loved the Alex Rider series even since I happened to randomly get the first book. Though it sat in a cardboard box, gathering dust, for far longer than I'd like to admit, I finally picked it up. That's when, years ago, I became so obsessed with wanting to know what was going to happen with him next. And now, finally, it's all coming to the end. Imagine my disappointment when I found out this would be the last Alex Rider book!<br /><br />Alex is an awesome character, and in this novel I could really seen how he's grown and developed over the course of the series-a little over a year in his life. He's still a teenager, and that year would have brought enough change as it was, without adding his tendency to be assigned missions by MI6. Usually missions that involve life or death situations. And I love how he still retained his childishness throughout it, without becoming a mundane, boring, flat character.<br /><br />The setting for this book was perfect. I could really picture everything that was going on, from the scenes filled with action to the more relaxing moments where the plot built. Placing the story in such a great place was definitely a great decision, and even though I've never been to Cairo or seen many pictures of it, the images were still in my mind.<br /><br />Anthony Horowitz has the ability to create some of the best villains ever, and the main bad guy in Scorpia Rising was no different. He was evil, insane, and driven into Alex's life. Even though he was easy to hate, I loved how he was portrayed and developed.<br /><br />I loved Scorpia Rising and give it 5/5 stars. I'm sad to see this series go, but it was amazing while it lasted. This was a fantastic conclusion, and I couldn't imagine it getting any better. I'm more than satisfied with how it all ended, though it did get quite sad. I really think everyone should give this series a chance, even if it's not what you're usually into! I never imagined I'd like a book about a teen spy, and this turned out to be one of the best series I've ever read.
1416955070|4.0|What to say? City of Bones was pretty fantastic. I've never fallen into a book that has captivated me so completely.<br /><br />In all honesty, I didn't really get into this book until almost page 100. It wasn't because the writing was bad or the story wasn't interesting and the characters were fine. For some reason, it just took me a little longer to get into this one. If you find yourself having the same issue, I urge you to keep reading. Do not give up. If you do, you will be missing out on a wonderfully captivating series.<br /><br />The world and plot were put together very nicely. Clare has managed to seamlessly weave vampires, werewolves, demons, and angels all together into a coherent story line. The plot itself is...unpredictable. At least, I didn't expect the ending.... But, to be honest. When I started reading this book, I wasn't really expecting everything it turned out to be. City of Bones actually left me a little disappointed. But not because it wasn't great. It was. But I went into it expecting something totally different and similar to every other urban fantasy out there. I went into it thinking that the author would give me what I wanted. She didn't. And that made rating this book really hard. I had to separate how the book actually was from the fact that I didn't get what I wanted.<br /><br />Now, you're probably thinking, that it doesn't sound like I enjoyed it all that much. The thing is, I did but I didn't at the same time. We're all so use to having (for example) the love interests ending up together in the first book. We get what we want. We may not know how we'll get it, but we know that in the end it'll be there and it'll happen. Clare does not write like that. She doesn't typically give you what you want and that's something you just have to accept. Which brings me to the topic of writing.<br /><br />There is absolutely no assurance in her writing that there will be a happy ending. None whatsoever. Clare strings you along like no other author possibly could. And she does it so well. City of Bones is written in third person, but I get so pulled into the characters heads and POVs that I sometimes forget. Clare is a very talented author.<br /><br />Characters...hmm, that's a tough one. I actually found Jace, Alec, and Isabelle to all be jerks throughout most of the book. But for some reason, I couldn't help but vote for them. They had to win. It didn't matter how badly they treated Clary, they had to succeed. As the story progresses, you get the sense that there's more to them then what you see. And you primarily see them acting like jerks because it's in Clary's POV. She doesn't know them. They don't know her. There's no bound between them, so you don't see the depths of Jace or any of the other characters, excluding her best friend, Simon.<br /><br />Simon bugs me. In fact, I wanted Simon to leave every time he showed up. I just hated him so much. He's actually a very sensitive and kind character but that's one of the reasons why I didn't like him. He lets Jace push him around and he was getting in the middle of Jace and Clary, messing things up when they just started getting good.<br /><br />Luke, Clary's father-figure, is so wonderful. From the moment he entered the book, I couldn't help but like him. He's the solid, dependable character that remains on the sidelines that we all love so much.<br /><br />All in all, trust me when I say, you do not want to pass on City of Bones.<br /><br />You can find more of my reviews on my blog Chasm of Books.<br />[...]hor possibly could.

0385738765|5.0|This has to be one of the best puzzling/conspiracy/dystopian books I've ever read. The characters are interesting and well thought out, the plot thickens with every page, and as soon as I think I've figured it all out, something goes haywire and I find out just how wrong I am. I love novels that keep me on my toes!<br /><br />The original concept of this book is amazing. Something that could easily be overdone, such as the government conspiracy, is given in a new light, definitely refreshing and interesting. Even when it verged on becoming `typical' there was something added to keep me quickly turning the pages.<br /><br />One aspect of the book I didn't really like was that sometimes the writing style annoyed me. Not enough to detract from enjoying the book but just enough so that I noticed it. Usually when I read I don't want to remember that I'd reading something someone else came up with-I want to be sucked into that world. An awkward writing style can detract from that.<br /><br />I'll definitely be anxiously awaiting the third and final book to this trilogy, which is released this fall. The Scorch Trials ends on an enormous cliff-hanger, which annoys me to no end. xD I give it 5/5 stars; this trilogy is definitely worth reading!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Not surprising at all why the politico's tried to cover it up.  This is the story of real American warriors putting it on the line and getting the job done.  THEY got Bin Laden.....  Not a schmuck in an office.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Anyone who loves history, music, amazing acting, love stories and losing yourself in a film of riviting emotion will love this adaptation of Victor Hugo's Masterwork. Hugh Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway (like you have never seen her before) and Amanda Seyfried (with the voice of an Angel) perform their roles as if they had truly lived them. Beautiful sets and cinematography, hauntingly beautiful songs and the outstanding acting from all of the actors brings this musical to the movies in a larger than life production.<br />When I saw this movie in the theatre, even the men were crying. Buy this movie, snuggle in for 2 1/2 hours and don't forget the tissues!  Congratulations to Anne Hathaway for winning an Oscar!!<br />Look for the gentleman trapped under the cart, whom Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman) saves, and then later saves Jean Valjean.<br />He is my niece's father-in-law! Go Mr. Tate!!!

B00947N6D8|4.0|I liked the movie. Also the animation. Bought it as a family movie night. It was a good movie. Thanks
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Recommended by many people. I found it good. Not a book that I would say was great. It wasn't one of those book you couldn't put down.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Adds are annoying and confusing to close. I wish it would have one way to close the add every time. Good game though.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Beautifully written! It is a very moving story. I highly recommend it in spite of the fact that it's a sad story.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so cool and very active, if you love horses this is the app for you!!<br /> Get it
B00846REIS|4.0|Taking from 50 Shades of Grey, this book is heavy on the sex side (although not the S&M variety) and a little light on the story.  The sexual interaction is the primary focus.  If you don't mind very graphic sex scenes, then this will certainly provide some spice for you.  It was a good quick read, but didn't delve as deeply into the characters as it could have.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Great movie, great acting.  Might be a bit more interesting to a person not as well-versed in the subject as I am!
B004VYYA2K|5.0|Great item! Pretty, nice to play with. Easily opens into a nice playmat designed as a house and just as easily zips up into a nice box that fits a lot of Barbie stuff!

B00AO686L0|5.0|This and 1995's &#34;Heat&#34; are Michael Mann's two best films. For my money, this one is the better of the two and deserved to take home the Best Picture Oscar over &#34;American Beauty&#34;. Michael Mann shows that's he's the master of this long-form procedural type of movie. The film is absolutely riveting for its 2-and-a-half hours, filled with strong characters and a level of complexity that's never hard to follow. The cast is led by fantastic performances from Russell Crowe (in an Oscar-worthy performance), Al Pacino, and Christopher Plummer.<br /><br />The Blu-ray has been recently remastered and it looks fantastic. There's a great deal of detail and sharpness gained over the old DVD of the film. The new transfer is natural and film-like in its texture. The Blu-ray picture is notably more colorful than the DVD, which had a somewhat muted look. Michael Mann is a very precise and demanding filmmaker, and I imagine the transfer must have met his approval before making its way onto this Blu-ray.<br /><br />The Blu-ray's audio does a solid job. Dialogue is crisp and clear and the music sounds excellent. The Blu-ray's biggest disappointment is the lack of much in the way of extras. The disc includes a short promotional-type featurette, and the theatrical trailer (both in standard definition). The film is definitely deserving of new extras like retrospective pieces, new interviews with cast and crew, or a commentary with Mann. How about the original 60 Minutes news piece? Or the Michael Mann and Jeffrey Wigand interviews from the Charlie Rose show? Anyway, the movie deserves more, and I think it's indicative of Disney/Touchstone's lack of care for their live action catalog titles. Still, the Blu-ray looks and sounds great and that's what matters the most.
B005DJREJS|5.0|Funny, easy to watch, addictive!  Lead actress is charming, you root for her all the way through. Highly recommended show!
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|Steven Spielberg's &#34;Schindler's List&#34; is not just an important historical piece, it's a wholly satisfying movie, and dare I say it, an entertaining one in its own right. Contrary to possible preconceptions, it's not a depressing slog of a movie. Much of the movie is gripping and taut with suspense. More importantly, there are genuine depictions of humanity and strength on display. Even moments of humor make their way into the film. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley head up a terrific cast, bringing life and charisma to their portrayals. At times, the movie may get a little melodramatic, but Steven Zaillian has crafted a great screenplay and Spielberg knows when big emotional flourishes are warranted. Everything from the cinematography, costumes, music, production design, and more are uniformly excellent.<br /><br />The film has been newly remastered for this Blu-ray and it looks terrific. The transfer is natural, film-like, and features great sharpness, detail, and shadow depth. The Blu-ray really showcases Janusz Kaminski's masterful black and white photography. The audio is equally excellent and does a great job presenting the film's sound design and John Williams' music.<br /><br />The biggest disappointment from this Blu-ray is the film's supplements. I guess Spielberg wants to treat this film as a historical document, and likewise the only extras are testimonies from Holocaust survivors and a brief piece about the Shoah Foundation (both the DVD #2 found in this set). While I understand the decision, I feel the movie also deserves to have its own story told. Why did Spielberg choose to make this film? How was it developed? How did the cast approach their roles? None of these topics are discussed on this Blu-ray. The only real document of the film's production we have is Franciszek Palowski's book &#34;The Making of Schindler's List: Behind the Scenes of an Epic Film&#34;.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Denzel Washington is my number 1 favorite actor. I can't get enough of his movies...watch them over and over again!  Flight can be added to this list.  The movie was thought provoking as well as redeeming (without giving too much away) There were also moments of tension and drama. Enjoyed it!
B008220DIC|5.0|&#34;The Master&#34; was my favorite film of 2012, but it's likely not to everyone's taste. The acting is amazing. Philip Seymour Hoffman and Joaquin Phoenix both deliver Oscar worthy performances. Stylistically, the movie is similar to Paul Thomas Anderson's previous film, 2007's &#34;There Will Be Blood&#34; but is perhaps less accessible. The movie's often mesmerizing and delivers quite an emotional wallop. But it lacks a strong narrative. It feels more episodic and leaves it to the viewer to make up his or her own mind as to what its message is and what its characters are about. Phoenix completely transforms himself into Freddie Quell while Hoffman impresses with his charismatic and well rounded portrayal of the Master himself, Lancaster Dodd. Amy Adams is also very good as Dodd's wife. Watching the Blu-ray, I found the movie just as hypnotic as it was in theaters. There are several sequences in the movie which are just thrilling to watch. The combination of superb acting, writing, editing, music, and Anderson's precise direction prove endlessly fascinating. Each viewing provides a new perspective on the film's characters and meanings.<br /><br />The Blu-ray features a stunning transfer. The movie was largely shot in 65mm and the Blu-ray presents a film-like image with minimal grain but staggering detail, sharpness, and depth. The audio is immersive as well, presenting Jonny Greenwood's propulsive rhythmic score, the dialogue, and classic songs with great clarity.<br /><br />I appreciate Paul Thomas Anderson's control over his films' home video releases from the cover art & packaging down to the very simple menus. There's none of the typical promotional ads and mumbo jumbo found on this disc. The Blu-ray features a 20-minute montage of deleted scenes set to Greenwood's score, trailers and promos, behind the scenes footage, and John Huston's documentary &#34;Let There Be Light&#34; which inspired the movie. The disc lacks a commentary or relevant interviews withthe cast & crew. I respect Anderson's decision to let the film speak for itself, but I would have welcomed a good discussion of the film. For example, there are a couple great Q&As with the director and cast up on YouTube.
B005LAIGRS|5.0|Safe House is a movie that keeps your eyes glued to the screen....get your popcorn before the movie starts because the action is non stop from beginning to end!
B00BGDQNLU|4.0|This is an underrated gem from the Coen Brothers. It often gets lost with their other 1990s output like &#34;Fargo&#34;, &#34;Miller's Crossing&#34;, &#34;The Big Lewbowski&#34;, and &#34;Barton Fink&#34;. The movie features a charming, witty, and cleverly written screenplay by the Coens and Sam Raimi. It perfectly evokes films from the 1930s and 1940s. The Coens add some wonderful and inventive visual flourishes in their direction. Tim Robbins' goofy protagonist with a lot of heart and a big idea, but not much else. I feel Jennifer Jason Leigh's performance is a bit too big. It's easy to see what she's aiming for, but the other performers are able to ground their characters in a way that Leigh doesn't quite pull off. Paul Newman also has fun as a scene stealing villain.<br /><br />The picture quality is relatively mediocre. It looks good in general, but it's not an appreciable upgrade from the DVD. There's less compression and slightly more detail than the DVD. On a whole, there's some light filtering and digital sharpening in the mix as well. The sound, presented in stereo, is good, but unspectacular as well.<br /><br />Overall, it's a great movie. The Blu-ray fails to really impress, but it's still a good presentation of the movie and still the best out there.
0316228532|3.0|I had high expectations for this book because I am a huge J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter fan.  However, I was disappointed.  But maybe it is impossible to live up to the precedence that Harry Potter set.  I would have considered it a decent book if it had been written by anyone else, but I expected more from J.K. Rowling.

B003EYVY04|1.0|I ordered Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Three-Disc Ultimate Edition.  It was a great deal, so I ordered.  I get a shipment in the mail from goHastings and it's NOT the ultimate edition, not even a special two-disc edition of it, but just Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Widescreen edition.  I am so angry with this.  This is false advertisement.  There's not even a way for me to email the seller.  I can just return it and get my money back.  Disappointing.

B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|It was one thing going to see the movie and being blown away not by the visual eye candy but the score that played as the action rolled was even better! The music really fits the movie. It sounds really beautiful. One of my favorite tracks \\"Waking Up\\" which by the way is the music playing in the opening scene. Right off the bat the music and movie grab you. M83 did a spectacular job with this score. Amongst my other favorite tracks are:<br /><br />\\"Canyon Battle\\"<br />\\"Tech 49\\"<br />\\"I'm Sending You Away\\"<br />\\"Raven Rock\\"<br /><br />Really looking forward to more score music of this type in the future from M83.<br />Buy this score you wont be disappointed!

Also during gaming, playing SWTOR for hours and hours, I never seen temps above 45°C socket temps and 36°C core temps....Ambient temps during all these readings were around 28°C  which is around 82°F.

B0050PYNP8|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, an homage to loving sci-fi and a look at the fan culture. (note: I watched the unrated version.) When I picked this movie to watch, I wasn't really paying much attention to the talent, but to the story: two Brits come to the US to attend ComicCon, then go on a road trip to visit some of America's famous UFO locales, including (but not limited to) Roswell and Area 51. At the very beginning of their road trip, they run into an alien named Paul. He looks exactly like the stereotypical alien with his big green head and big eyes and skinny body. But he has abilities - he can become invisible - and he has some, shall we say, bad habits, including smoking dope and drinking beer. And cursing. A lot.<br /><br />The story that follows is at turns amusing (all of Paul's cursing), at turns thoughtful (Paul's debate against an all-knowing God); sometimes action-packed (being chased by the government) and sometimes just silly (Paul pretending to be a statue of an alien). It's also full of references to classic sci-fi movies, which the true fan will really enjoy (and the sorta fan won't notice or miss).<br /><br />Now to talk about the talent: the writers - and main actors - are Simon Pegg and Nick Frost, a pair I first saw in the silly but fun Brit TV Comedy [[ASIN:B0019MFY3Q Spaced: The Complete Series]].  (Frost is also great in the sci-fi Brit TV Comedy [[ASIN:B000R20W8Q Hyperdrive]].)  They obviously had a lot of fun writing and starring in the movie. My favorite actor in the movie, tho, is Jason Bateman. He usually plays such goofy characters, that to see him play a very focused, driven government agent was quite refreshing. I also enjoyed Jane Lynch as an storekeeper selling alien tchochkys; Kristen Wiig as Ruth, daughter of a Bible-thumper; and of course, the actress who plays The Big Guy (you'll just have to watch the movie to find out!). The only downer for me was the person who voiced Paul: Seth Rogen. Rogen is a fine actor, but every time Paul opened his mouth, I only saw Rogen, not the alien he was meant to portray.<br /><br />I also think I probably should have watched the theatrical version - the unrated one is just a tad too long.<br /><br />4.5 stars.aul opened his mouth, I only saw Rogen, not the alien he was meant to portray.<br /><br />I also think I probably should have watched the theatrical version - the unrated one is just a tad too long.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We've gone back to watch Season 1 after watching episodes from following seasons. This show is well written, directed and the acting is outstanding. It's not often that you can go back to earlier episodes of a series and find the same quality of performances.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is my second pair of this model.  They are lightweight, sturdy and have good sound quality.  Note:  I mostly use them to listen to recorded books, only occasionally for listening to music but I still find them very satisfactory. They can be folded over and carried in a small bag with my MP3 player.

B00A9V2JSG|4.0|As far as dystopian novels go, this is definitely in league with The Hunger Games and the Divergent trilogy. However, there are a few key factors that appealed to me in Delirium which I can say lacked a tiny bit in development with the aforementioned writings. First off, Delirium doesn't disguise the fact that it's a love story. The entire plot revolves around just that from the very beginning, and the depth in which love or the destruction of it, can change the world is brilliantly depicted. Secondly, I must say that Lauren Oliver has quite the way with words. She can be articulate, poetic, devastating, and artful all in the same breath. Enjoyed the style of writing as much as I did the plot of the story.
B009D3CTVS|3.0|...which would be fine, if the description didn't state incorrectly: \\"Compatible with Mac and Windows operating systems\\". This suggests that it is compatible with all Mac and Win systems, which it is not. Either the word \\"some\\" is missing from \\"operating systems\\" or rather, the minimum system requirements should be listed, as expected for all computer accessories. Unfortunately, Roland doesn't make it easy at all to find it on their website's product page either.<br /><br />When I received the box, saw on the back: \\"compatible with OS 10.5.8 or higher systems, intel macs only\\". I would recommend to keep this in mind when purchasing, and of course, check the return policy of the seller you are buying it from. Unfortunately in my case the item was not available for purchase directly from Amazon, and I made the mistake of going through an unknown seller.<br /><br />Later, I ended up buying the EMU XMIDI 1X1 USB MIDI Interface, which is also plug&play, has the same cable length, works wonderfully with no perceivable latency, transmits sysex and mtc, and is less expensive.

She said &#34;I want you to take me like they do on the Game of Thrones!&#34; It peaked our curiosity and we decided to just buy episode one off of our new TV.... it immediatly got us hooked! We had to go out and find the whole first season.... (it was quite a troublesome task, actually) and then watched it within 3 days! We then bought the second season and we are on episode 4 and we are still enjoying the story line! Sometimes they get ya hooked with the first season and then the next few are horrible, but this is not the case with this show! All in all I would reccommend to everyone except my mom :)

I have the earlier DVD version, which has much  better sound quality.<br /><br />The movie itself is brilliant, but I feel I wasted $30 on this version, I wish I could return it.
B008Y1RTUG|3.0|It's an okay movie.  The best thing about it was the Huntsman.  I would have liked to know a little more of his background, but I did find myself dozing off here and there, so I could have missed it.  SPOILER ALERT - there was some conflict/tension throughout the movie about the Huntsman's role and William's.  That element alone made me stay tuned, so that was good.  The dwarfs roles were marginalized.  There wasn't a distinct articulation of the personalities like in the tradition movie, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.  I'm looking forward to the sequel once it's out on DVD.

Also, the characters are so believable that when one of them died, I was actually saddened.<br /><br />Great actors and acting:<br />Robyn Rihanna Fenty - she actually did a pretty decent job<br />Taylor Kitsch - unknown to me, but very charismatic - ya gotta love him<br />Alexander Skarsgård - LOVE HIM!!!  He's a great older brother, very responsible.<br />Liam Neesom - one of my favorite actors ever since Taken<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT:  I loved the overall message of the movie.  Stick to the old, tried, and true!  (Tap into the wisdom of your elders.)

B008602KQI|5.0|Great action movie without too much gore. It also has enough sci-fi to make the movie not quite of this world. If this movie was too realistic, it would have been a little difficult to watch.
B00BF123WG|2.0|Too much darkness. May be O.K. for a theater showing, but  I had a hard time watching it on a small screen. Also, too much use of f..... words. I can't see the director of CIA using such language, especially in front of female agents, or having a female agent using such language when speaking to the Director. That was a bit too much Hollywood.

B007JVJ3C4|4.0|I was in the military when Ghost Rider first hit the stands. I bought every one I could lay my hands on but they were not everywhere . I would ask and the answer was generally the same ( I don't sell enough of them ) . I have some of those comics and when comics became an investment I tried to cash them in . You know what, they were not worth anything. Some are retailed at two to three hundred now but that is only since the movies.<br />Anyone who reads books and then watches a movie based on that literature will say it is not as good as the book. Screen plays are not books and movies have to appeal to a large audience to break even. They are supposed to make money and of course this franchise Does. This , a good movie visually and the 3- D is pretty good on my home screen works for me. The story is secondary to the action as it should be in this type of film. I enjoyed it as I did the first mostly because it is not the comic book which is in no way literature . The writers and illustrators never claimed they were. True to the character is fine by that characters fans but truth is Ghost rider has always had a limited fan base and I am sure there are those who see the movies , buy a comic and are disappointed .  I think old fans of the comic see or imagine ourselves as lone wolves like the Rider and probably should not criticize . My rating is based on my opinion of how my taste run and this movie entertained me as it probably did for many that do not do reviews . One other thing I would like to say is , most of the shows and movies I have enjoyed the most were hated by critics and if you will check the most successful usually are. The only bad thing I can say about this set is it does not have a DVD copy.

This is heavy metal at its finest not a bad song on this album at all. Great riffs and especially heavy riffs. I can't thank Metallica enough for their amazing music. This is still one of the better selling heavy metal albums 22 years later! Too rate this anything less than 5 stars is shocking. This album marked a change from their first 4 albums from thrash metal to heavy metal and I love it and its just as good as their first 4 albums, that's why its gone 16x platinum in the USA alone and the top selling album since the sound scan era began in 1991.
B000NA2776|5.0|Mika is fabulous, an exception to the disappointing pop music on the radio. Grace Kelly is one of my all-time favorite songs.
1616550414|5.0|Wonderful book. Son loved it. Started reading it the moment it arrived. He loves &#34;everything&#34; about the book. Says &#34;Geez Mom, whats not to like, it's Zelda!!&#34;

B001VM0LAK|1.0|After 10 attempts, I finally gave up.  I have to purchase it all over again and pay again as well.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Maybe considered best sci fi drama Space Western tv shows around if you havent see this you dont know what u are missing its mesmerizing edge seat thriller drama i am so hooked watch it again and again must see must have dvd tv show ok
B005BGBPBG|4.0|Good movie!! The entire cast brought out their personality into the characters. They showed being young adults 30something crowd you don't have your life figured out by a certain age. When making important life changing decisions being true to yourself as an individual is significant, especially what matters from the heart. I would have loved to seen more on the relationship between the 2 main characters Rachel & Darcy. It would have been interesting to see the dynamics of how their friendship changed and grew especially the scene at the end.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Hello After watching Firefly i couldnt wait to see the Movie it doesnt disappoint the conclusion to this great Space Western Drama must see ...... its superb allways be one best tv shows around.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn really did a great job with this book. Gone Girl is multi-layered, and has excellent character development, which is really important to make us feel emotionally invested. I wish I could find more books like this that really keep me thinking critically about every page. Wonderful!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Taken right out of current headlines.  Scary look at the not too distant future.  Cyber terrorism has already happened and we are likely in for more.
B0002XNT0I|5.0|Besides being the best movie ever this came when they said it would and it was in the condition they said it would be in.  If you haven't seen this movie you have missed the best movie Denzel and Tom ever made.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Nice collection and very worth the money to have the whole thing in one set.  We love Harry Potter movies.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|My daughter had told me about Jennifer Lawrence from the Hunger Games.  I didn't think much of it until I saw her performance in Silver Linings.  Now I can see why my daughter enjoys her so much.  I have now seen several of her films and it seems she is great at portraying a young girl from a dis-functional family where she must overcome obstacles and rise above the fact that her parents have let her down.  She always seems to play a very smart, strong young woman that pushes thru the mess and ends up on top.  She has a true honesty in all of her performances including the &#34;Winter's Bone&#34;.  Some parts were difficult for me to watch, but, I did so that I could see the outcome of the film.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I've been playing CTR Time Travel free version from Gplay and if I keep liking it, I'll get this paid version. Why not test drive before buying? No need to waste the dough if it sucks, right?<br /><br />I wasn't a huge fan of the original CTR, but I did think the little monster is cute and funny. This Time Travel edition is basically the same game as the original, but the graphics are even cuter and it's holding my interest, so I'll probably buckle down and splurge the 99cents for this full version.<br /><br />Fun to play with Vikings, Pirates and Egyptian versions of the cutie monster. I guess these are all his ancestors through time. Doesn't look like the little guy has evolved much over time, save his silly wigs and nifty costumes. Very cute, adorable and good fun.<br /><br />All the fun of the original, but better, hence why I like this one so much more. Fun!
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I am not a person that watches scary films, however, I was really drawn into this movie.  The two young actors were so good with their performances that I overlooked the scary parts so I could see the entire film and enjoy their performances.
B00C5ZS5SC|5.0|This is by far, the best music I've heard this year.  I am soooo happy I discovered Ms. Ware. Her voice is hypnotic and contagious.  This is an AWESOME sound.  I can't stop listening to her.  I love this CD.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Kept me wondering and guessing from page 1. Like the strong female characters.  Reacher is amazingly simple and complex. His thinking logic is entertaining.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You felt it .. you feel it.. you see it and you think twice and remember the angst of youth and realise how pathetic our adult troubles can be when faced with death at your door when you are young.<br />read with hot chocolate.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I am a big Star Trek fan and have been since the mid 60's when the first serie was on the air.  THis is why I have it on my Kindle Fire, so I can watch it where ever I go.  It is a great SiFi series and Gene Roddenberry always has more than one topic going at a time in each show.  Deals with issues that also pretain to the current times.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Most have seen this movie, that love Colin Firth (Mr. Darsey) and the whole royal family thing. I likey very much & would<br />encourage anyone too rent, buy or see this very well acted/directed  movie, that deserves all honours won.

B00BG4RLF6|5.0|James Blake's 2011 self-titled effort ([[ASIN:B004CR5TD0 James Blake]]) exhibited plenty of promise. Even so, it didn't quite feel valedictory, leaving ample room for improvement. Hypnotizing as it was, James Blake at times lacked enough definition, a problem not present on one of the years biggest heavyweights, Overgrown.  If James Blake was the singer/songwriter/producer's introduction, [[ASIN:B00BG4RLF6 Overgrown]] must surely be his coronation.  Superb from top to bottom, Blake leaves very little room for nitpicking or criticism.  The balance is nearly perfect.<br /><br />\\"Overgrown\\" opens the effort moodily and mysteriously, in the most `gorgeous' way.  Blake's vocals are clear, never obstructed by the production.  An constantly evolving cut, the full scope is realized when the production expands to its lushest - pads, strings, reverb laden piano.  \\"I Am Sold\\" follows justly, with Blake oscillating between vocals that sit atop the production and those mixed in the background.  It may not be as breathtaking as the opener, but the cool electro R&B-infused cut certainly comes close.  \\"Life Round Here\\" continues consistency and clever experimentation by Blake, with the synths progressing from soft-edged to hard-edged. The attention Blake pays to detail is impeccable.<br /><br />While \\"I Am Sold\\" and \\"Life Round Here\\" both captivate, \\"Take A Fall for Me\\" and \\"Retrograde\\" moves things up a notch. \\"Take A Fall for Me\\" features veteran MC RZA, who captivates.  Accompanying RZA's excellent performance is a host of thoughtful vocal and production ideas from Blake.  The basic production itself is chilly and cerebral in the alternative/electronica sense, while being very conducive to RZA's rhymes.  Single \\"Retrograde\\" sports a magnificent R&B/urban flare, capped off by Blake's soulful humming.  The epic moment arrives as Blake sings \\"Suddenly I'm hit...\\"; the excitement level grows with Blake's voice sounding its most enthused and invested.<br /><br />\\"DLM\\" is a brief 2:25 in duration, but it packs as much punch as anything else.  As important as Blake's vocals/lyrics is his beloved acoustic piano, in which the riffs are bluesy and organic.  The cut ends with phasing piano, something that seems directly out of the Philip Glass school. \\"Digital Lion\\" is hypnotizing, reminiscent of some of the minimal repetitive concepts from his debut.  Filled with animated synthetic drums and subdued, repetitive vocal ideas, \\"Digital Lion\\" continues to showcase Blake at his best.  \\"Voyeur\\" puts more weight on lyrics than some cuts tend to, sounding expressive as he sings: \\"Cause I am flawed / when I am through those doors / cause I am flawed / times unsure /  I should do whatever will make you feel secure...\\"  Some artists/songs fail to succeed with a few amount of words; James Blake excels.<br /><br />Penultimate cut \\"To The Last\\" is easily one of the best in a stacked affair.  Tender, and thoughtful, the key lyric is \\"To the last, you and I\\".  With love on the mind, the smoothness and softer sounds reflects a more gentlemanlike Blake.  If \\"To The Last\\" wasn't enough to convince of Blake's concern with love, closing cut \\"Our Love Comes Back\\" confirms it (\\"Our love comes back in the middle of the night\\").<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00BG4RLF6 Overgrown]] epitomizes excellence in a time where few albums do so.  Incredibly well conceived and defined by musicianship and creativity, it is easily among the best of 2013.in duration, but it packs as much punch as anything else.

B00B2QG3K2|4.0|Paramore returns after a four year hiatus with the release of 2013's self-titled effort [[ASIN:B00B2QG3K2 Paramore]].  After `09s successful [[ASIN:B002FRNCG0 Brand New Eyes]], things from an outward perspective seemed to be falling apart for the band, just as success continued to mount.  The exit of the Farro brothers left the question about the future livelihood and lucrativeness of the band, stripped to a trio including Hayley Williams, Taylor York, and Jeremy Davis.  The results end up greatly exceeding expectations, as Paramore is one of the year's better and hottest albums. Add to those accolades a number one debut on the charts, and the coronation is complete.  Justin Meldal-Johnsen handles the production work.<br /><br />\\"Fast In My Car\\" sets the tone, laden with hefty guitar work, pummeling drums, and feisty vocals from Hayley Williams.  \\"We're driving fast in my car / we've got our riot gear on but we just want to have fun...\\", she sings enthusiastically on the chorus.  \\"Now\\", similarly, is a ball of energy, finding Williams in tongue-in-cheek mode, stretching out vocal syllables: \\"if there's a future, we want it / Now-ow-ow...\\". \\"Grow Up\\" is arguably the best of a fine opening trio, featuring solid songwriting, catchy chorus, and a whiny, invested Williams.  Throw in some 80s synths at the conclusion for good measure, and \\"Grow Up\\" is rock solid.<br /><br />\\"Daydreaming\\" is equally catchy and memorable, one of the true gems; it benefits from thoughtful development and overall pacing.  After a ukelele-accompanied interlude, the show-stopping \\"Ain't It Fun\\" gives Paramore one of their best songs, EVER.  The gospel-infused choral vocals truly propel during the vamped sections (\\"Don't go crying to your mama / cause you're on your own in the real world...\\"). \\"Part II\\" proceeds consistently, while \\"Last Hope\\" impresses with its balance of push and pull, not to mention Jeremy Davis's active bass line.  \\"Still Into You\\" once more nods to the 80s, with Williams's personality at its most magnetic.<br /><br />\\"Anklebiters\\" is as assertive in sound as it's clever title suggests.  Uptempo punk at it's best, the song isn't even among the best on this ultra consistent set.  Following another ukelele-driven interlude, \\"Proof\\" possesses a jungle-like quality, given its pounding drums.  It falls short of the elite, but its follow-up \\"Hate To See Your Heart Break\\" makes the cut, showing William's more tender vocal side.  She and the band contrast smoothness for the `crazed' on \\"(One of Those) Crazy Girls\\" in which Williams is quick to state \\"I'm not one of those crazy girls...\\" However after a revealing chorus (\\"Baby are we over now? Maybe I can change your mind? As soon as you walk out my door / I'm gonna call a hundred times\\"), the end finds Williams accepting her fate (\\"Now I'm one of those crazy girls\\").<br /><br />A final interlude precedes \\"Be Alone\\", which is a typical Paramore cut (driving, dirty guitars, Williams assertive).  Closer \\"Future\\" is more experimental, featuring vocals early on, but conceding most of its duration to instrumental ideas.  All in all, [[ASIN:B00B2QG3K2 Paramore]] ends up being an unexpected surprise.  If anything, the exits of Josh and Zac Farro only fueled the fire of the trio, who truly compel to the upmost here.

B006YTTVHO|5.0|A great book for meeting people. After reading about these small steps to take . I am convinced I can meet anyone.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This film is no only visually stunning, it keeps you on edge as to what will happen next. Highly recommended.
B0067QPVD2|5.0|These fine folks have created a really authentic &#34;Prequel&#34;. I enjoyed the lead in to the event we could only guess about when &#34;The Thing&#34; remake was first released. The script is first rate, the acting is great, the special effects, award winning. Can't lose by buying this film. I wish I'd seen it in 3D in the theater. It's in my DVD cabinet next to its progenitor. Buy it, watch it and enjoy it again and again.
0316228532|2.0|Sorry to say, I started it and could not continue, I have it there to read some day.  I will need a notebook to write down every personage because I can follow it better that way.  I didn't like the content, I liked her children's book so much more.  The best writing I ever read,  I'm going to be 61 in May and I am a kid at heart. I love books with a better content.  Sorry J.K.
B004AYCWY4|4.0|Clear explanation with pictures. The book is in good conditions. Lots of evidence are used. The author uses different examples to support his idea.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|What a fantastic movie, the cover photo almost made me skip it, the five star review was what made me give it a second glance I am happy I did,
B005BZQS1E|1.0|I picked this instant video movie \\"Your Highness\\" because it was at the top of the comedy and the drama Instant Video lists.  The trailer was deceptive.  This was a crass, poorly acted, homophobic, not funny movie.  Don't waste your time.  After the fact, I checked with rottentomatoes.com and it got a 23% ...all rotten reviews except one.  If there was a way to get my money back or have the money sent to a Charity. I'd do it...  Perhaps this would be a way to \\"walk out\\" of bad movies... have Amazon donate the money to charity and not reward the creation of drivel like this. [[ASIN:B005BZQS1E Your Highness]]
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|This game is great until you get deep into it and realize that the developer has set it up to require actual money (and often it's more than a few dollars) to get some of the really cool stuff (T-Rex).  They could have sold this app for a few bucks instead of price gouging players for a lot of the cool stuff.  Earning bucks in the game takes forever.  Overall, Jurassic Park Builder is fun, but  come prepared to spend some at least $25 to get a full experience.
B00BBW16HW|1.0|Would not have bought if known it was sub-titled. Saw no mention of this on main description.  Waste of money.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|I was getting more and more frustrated with video that wouldn't play on my &#34;old&#34; Android 2.1.1 OS tablet but this program fixed that! I can now play anything out there no matter the format! Automatically and seamlessly. MobON!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|So far so good. I still have a lot to learn but I am impressed with its  ease of use.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this book on my Kindle app on my iPad based on other customer reviews. I never even heard about this book before.<br />I loved it from the get-go. It had me roped in right away!
B00A8ECU24|2.0|My daughter was very excited to play, but the app would constantly freeze. Then when she wasn't playing I would get constant notifications saying, &#34;...is ready to play!&#34; If only my daughter could play when she wanted.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I LOVE the Hunger Game trilogy! Very entertaining, great writing, amazing characters. I even got my husband to read and love them! :)
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use this for all my pdf files. I am always getting articles to review and this app is awesome in organizing and viewing even oddly sized files. A wonderful app!
B004GTLVOA|4.0|The entire Outlander series has been a great read.  If you like a little history, romance, good old fashion warfare, and an actual story line.  I recommend this series.  There's something to be said to losing yourself in a good book!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|What single thing could you ever say about Google that would help someone understand how useful it is when you work production and need a specific name or article, and you then type in some search criterion and get what you need in a second. The thing I'd say is work flow satisfaction, that is what Google and this app is all about. Fast, effective, so you can move on quickly and keep the production numbers high.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book was definitely one that read more like a young adults novel, but was one I enjoyed anyway.  What I call an easy read, it had a surprise twist at the end that was just enough to make my eyebrows raise and tilt my lips in a smile.  I have not read the alternate ending that was issued after my purchase so I can't speak to that.  I would rate this book in with the Twilight series in regards to complexity of story and how smoothly it was read.
B004NELBPC|5.0|This app is my news source. My favorite columns are headlines, of course, and Green and Science. But really the core of it is great writing. This is some of the best journalism I have read anywhere. Props, guys.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|We have watched this movie about 20 times.  We note new items in the show each time.  There is a lot going on in the back ground.  We only found two sequence mistakes in the movie which is pretty darn good.  Jennifer Lawrence seems to be one of those people who could be just about any girl, that is, she is pretty average looking.  That said she is pretty good at acting with the ability to make you feel that the situations are real.  Watch it, it is much better than the Twilight series.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I thought the movie was fantastic. I wish the movie series started with the first book, but better late than never. I wish the movie was available when I worked with my GT reading students. We read the book together in class and had to watch a cartoon version of the movie. Now that this DVD is available, it is an excellent addition to follow up the book.
B000000YNZ|5.0|But not sideways, never sideways. Smooth and soft like bourbon. Hardly any smoke.  It's legal here in Washington and it goes great with Moon Beams.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Wow! This book provides excellent insights into introverts as leaders. I am excited to learn that there are others like me!
0345529057|5.0|i have all four of them. impecable. Reading first one ATM and it's expectacularly written and overwhemlingly trapping. totally recommended
B006OCM0G0|3.0|once at level 99 now its taking way way longer to get points n move up in this level.... makes it less enjoyable its like there is not another level 2 reach after 99
B004TMPJP6|5.0|Easy, useful. Perfect for husband and wife to share shopping and to do lists. Clean and functional. I recommend it.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I know now why this film was so so highly rated. Jenneifer Lawrence was superb in her portrayal of her teenage character. Most of her character stayed in emotionally filled unknown, fearful, and/or stressful situations. Her ability in communiting these emotions to the viewer were convincingly realistic. You could actually see her communicating love, joy, compassion, unknown, an/or fear in her eyes as well as her other actions in a realistic manner that has no comparison. Her guest appearance on a late-night talk show was light hearted and entertaining, but her acting was all business in a good way. Best free &#34;Prime Membership&#34;movie I have seen to date.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this site gives me access to any type of creative idea that I need and at the touch of my kinfle

B000NTPDSW|5.0|It's hard not to like the Godfather, it's possibly in the top ten best movies ever made, including foreign language films. If you like the Godfather, it's like watching for the first time again. If you didn't like it, don't bother.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|It is the worst performance I ever saw from Jude Law. He was wooden and stodjy in his characterization-The actual character was not like that. I expected a more dynamic character from him. The actor playing Bronsky was too effiminate in his characterization. He is supposed to be a military man as well as a spoiled autocrat. Keira Knightly needs to work on her emoting of the darker emotions.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Works really well and the characters are so adorable! It's  hard to get more bling sometimes. But I still love this game!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Good dynamics from the cast. The dwarves were a little over the top, but all in all awell played and well cast film.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Everyone kept talking about this show. I had never seen it. So, when it showed up here, I thought I'd see what my friend\s were talking about. I loved it! What a fun series! New favorite!
160094048X|5.0|I agree with the majority, this book is stellar.  Not one recipe has failed me thus far.  Instead of singing praises over the two amazing authors, I'll just dive right in and list my favorites:<br /><br />Chocolate Chip Cookies: duh<br /><br />Chocolate Fudgy Oatmeal Cookies: So moist, don't skip the almond extract and cherries!<br /><br />City Girl Snickerdoodles: Just like momma made<br /><br />Sell Your Soul Pumpkin Cookies:  Which is exactly what I would do for a batch of these<br /><br />Banana Everything Cookies: OMG, I am B-A-N-Anas for these<br /><br />Peanut Butter Crisscrosses: Another one just like momma used to make<br /><br />Carmel Pecan Bars: A bar does not get more perfect than this, I make these for the holidays every year and every year my non-vegan family members gobble them up and claim that there is no way they are vegan.<br /><br />Lemon Bars: They are lemon bars, I don't need to sell them.<br /><br />Roll-and-Cut Sugar Cookies: They don't get more classic than this one.<br /><br />Gingerbread Cut-Out Cookies: So perfectly dense and moist.<br /><br />No-Bake Pecan Chocolates: If you a problem with saying no to sweets, you need to stay away from these.<br /><br />Overall, if you want a go-to vegan cookie cookbook (say that 10 times fast), then this is your book.  It's perfection and whenever I NEED a cookie, I know I can find satisfaction in this book.  I want for no other cookie recipes at this point.
0064431789|5.0|I bought this to share with my 14 month old grandson. I had it as a child, I read it to my son as a child and he, in turn, bought it for his son. So, this three-generation book is a big hit! I used to be able to recite the entire book. I still remember most of it.<br /><br />As a child, the illustrations were magical. I had never seen anything like it and I still remember the feeling. Fast forward 40+ years and the world is a much more colorful place. The graphics may not seem as groundbreaking today. But, they are still magical. I have seen 1-star reviews of this book and I am shocked. It's like giving A Christmas Carol or The Sneetches a 1-star review. Everyone, of course, has the right to their opinion. I can't help thinking they just don't get it. Maybe they don't read very much?<br /><br />Buy this book!!! Share the magic with your children and grandchildren. Someday, they too, might be able to recite the whole book word for word ... to their children.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I've had this watch for a month and I like it a lot. The green face and canvas band are different and look great with weekend khakis. This is not a bulky watch (which I like), it won't snag on your pants pocket and you can button a shirt sleeve over it. The strap may be a bit on the short side for some. I have smallish wrists (~8&#34;) and there are only three holes left for expansion, so it might not work for someone who's really big.<br /><br />The accuracy is less than I would like as it gains about 8 seconds a day, but I understand that it's not bad for a mechanical watch. The autowind works as advertised, but I took one star off as it runs for a maximum of 36 hours on the nightstand. If I take it off before bed, wear a different watch the next day, then sleep in on the third day, I find that it has stopped and must be reset and rewound. It works best for someone who intends to wear it all day, every day.<br /><br />You can wind the watch &#34;manually&#34; by slipping a ball point pen throught the buckle and a very small finishing nail through one of the strap holes. Then hold the pen in one hand, the nail in the other and rotate your hands in a circular motion. 60 turns will keep it running for a couple of hours.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very pleased with this watch. There's still something satisfying about a solid piece of mechanical equipment, even in our increasingly digital world.
B00AFOS9C2|5.0|I haven't listened to Act III yet - I am trying to get over Siegmund's death before I proceed - but at least acts I and II are wonderful.  If I never see/hear another Walkure again I won't mind because I can just watch this one over and over and over.  I cannot imagine anyone ever topping Kaufmann's Siegmund.
B00CBXV96I|5.0|Hope enough people watch that this show stays around for more than one season.  Love the premise, the acting and the creepiness.
0765325950|5.0|I recently got these books from one of my grandparents and he had all of them but the last three, I have been sitting on pins and needles hoping that the ending wasn't what I was thinking it was. Brandon Sanderson did not disappoint you Mr. Jordan! He helped finished the series right!!!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Came in perfect condition and quickly. I grew up watching Muppet Christmas Carol. So being able to keep up this family tradition meant a lot.  Definitely recommend this movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is erotic and naughty but it has an amazing plot line and I enjoyed watching Christian and Ana grow...
042524489X|5.0|love this book, have been waiting for it to come out, love the story line, could tell it was going to be good
1481278738|5.0|being new to this great camera, hero 3 black I was looking for hints and suggestions of settings etc.<br />Although focused on the surf use it does contain some good info for the newbie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is easy to play and is entertaining. Horses are beautiful and graphics are clear. If for a child, they must be able to follow written directions.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I think this rating  would blowpeople out the house.<br />I would recommend this to people in my book club.<br />  .
B005K17RU0|2.0|I don't know what happened to the application I downloaded in November but you've changed it and it's more detailed but doesn't work with Kindle Fire anymore.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|I can't believe I didn't see this in the theater! Should have won BEST PICTURE of the year! Tarantino went all out and bloody in all action scenes. Jaimie Fox and Kerry Washington at their best, along with Leonardo's captivating scenes as a villain
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I can not go on enough about these books! They were wonderful and so funny!  I dont know how many times I would catch myself giggling due to something Alexia had either said or thought.  I wish I could be her when I grow up.  This set is a really good bargain and you save at least $5 if you dont buy them seperately.  I would recommend these books to anyone and their mother!!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Another Disney masterpiece! A nostalgia piece for all gamers of the 80s and 90s. Every family needs to watch and see together. LOVE the twist at the end!
B008EEHRAU|5.0|It's my All Time Favorite Movie. The screenplay, the ACTING.. The Directing, the Producer's and ALL StaFF involved in making this Masterpiece.
B00BAVCD8A|5.0|Welcome back Fall Out Boy! I was so sad when they broke up, so when I heard about their return I was so excited! Now, a lot of people might not like this album since it is a little bit more poppy than their previous songs. But for me? I effin love it! The songs are all catchy and fun, I'm very happy with the outcome and I can't wait to see more albums by them.
B00846TRHY|5.0|this movie was recommended to me<br />the movie was well done<br />The movie pushed me out of my comfort zone, it was inspiring
B00992CF6W|5.0|This review is from my 9 y/o: I love this game, it doesn't need Internet so I can play in the car or when traveling!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is such a fun show.  Everyone should see this.  It is a hero show to the maximum and many great actors
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Thanks...my kindle wasn't working and this did the trick...great customer service!!!! My kindle is running great so far..Thanks again! Gail
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Wonderful game that involves patience and wrecking of the mind whilst playing this game. It helps organize our intellect and form ideas and gather wits to make decisions at drop of the hat.
1451695195|5.0|Very interesting, a person that was raised near where I live.  Sad a person of his intelligence had to experince what he did to believe there was actually a God and that people actually see things with near death experiences.<br />It's been my experience with family at Hospice, when  they are approaching death, crossing-over to their next life, there's more people in the room with them than we're aware of.  Loved ones come to meet them, we can only hope for this when our time comes..
B005HSL626|5.0|Wonderful game which my niece played joyfully and she is just at the sweet age of 4. This is easiest and the best game that test our tactile response and strength and boggles our mind to keep sharp and keep an eye on all the movements in split second. Wonderful UI and the sounds.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Enjoyed this book. It is a page turner. I would recommend as great vacation read. I finished in 3 days while on the beach.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|The UI and the easy navigation makes this app splendid to use. I can easily track my bids, messages and my items on sale flawlessly. Most recommended for anyone who uses ebay largely in their everyday life.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|I have this cd in my car and listen to it a lot. What beautiful voices these women have. Thank you so much
B00ARX2W24|4.0|I am happy to add this set to my collection of Alpert Albums. This set includes some really catchy beats to listen to<br />specially while driving on the road.
B0015T6G2G|5.0|After my visit to South Africa, I wanted to learn more about the culture and Nelson Mandela. SO, I bought his biography and couldn't stop reading it until it was finished. It is pretty long, but I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. At times, he made you feel like you were there with him in the struggle during the pain and suffering and also felt his happiness when it ended. Highly recommend this to anyone!
B003XWFLTM|5.0|It seems that the Russian conductor leading a Russian orchestra can best interpret the Score of this greatest of Russian Composers after all.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I've used this cord a couple of times since i had it. It works great! I like it better than the remote, it doesn't need batteries. This item was packaged in the original Nikon packaging. Definitely authentic. I only use Nikon products for my camera.
B0001MLMKY|5.0|My husband bought it and loves it. he wears it everyday instead of the other watch that we spent over $200 for. The other watch is too heavy and he loves this one. Good quality and practical product.
B005ZCXPP0|3.0|This movie is good entainment but not a movie that you would collect to watch again and again to understand all the sub plots.  It is meant to be a part of a series that I would watch and encourage others to do so if science action is your thing.
B005LLX582|5.0|Thought provoking movie that makes you dig deeper into the recesses of the soul and mind. I consider it a masterpiece.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|Turns out that I am not a big fan of Emmylou Harris, which I verified after ordering this. It has nice music but I do not care to listed to a complete album of her songs. I am going to download the music to my mp3 player and shuffle the songs so I can enjoy her in smaller doses.
B000M4RGA6|4.0|Amazing. He can do more than slapstick. After watching \\"Blades of Glory\\" (in my defence, I was trapped on an airplane) I thought he was hopeless. Instead, he was near perfect in his role here as was the rest of the cast. An interesting and entertaining movie.<br /><br />Have to say that a well made Blu-ray helps any movie!
B00000ITOY|5.0|This was on my grandson's Amazon wish, thanks to my daughter in law who made a list for all 4 of my grandchildren. I ordered it and had it mailed directly to their home. My daughter in law wrote that my grandson loves it!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin's back and every track of the album is great. It's also interesting that most tracks can be up to 7 minutes long but they are all fun to listen to. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A beautiful book. If you're Irish or of Irish decent it's a special treat. This is a talented writer. I'm excited to read what else she has out there.I'm buying this for my Irish girlfriends in Rockaway Beach. It will be a great read by the shore this summer.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|this game is awesome I'm have the hammer head shark.I wish I had the great white shark. this is thomas
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love this book. Once again she does it. She is always funny. I laugh at her jokes even though it's a book. I have never read a book that has made me laugh this much. Definitely the funniest book ever!!!!!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great series - the characters come alive for you. Can't wait to purchase season 3. Hoping there will be a season 4.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is extremely addictive the only thing that i hate is that I have to wait to gain prizes. But when the time pases it is very fun!!! I play it all the time!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|The movie was OK.  Good for killing time.  Bridget Moynahan is still beautiful.  Michelle Rodriguez is still boyish.  Aaron Eckhart is like a batman, not the two-face any more.
B002C4YYEU|5.0|I loved it. My sister kept insisting and insisting for me to watch it and when I finally did I was so glad she kept insisting. I insist you watch this movie it is worth the time and money!!! it will not disappoint.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|I bought this case for my kindle because I didn't like 1 single case that I found at any retail store. My only complaint is that the only way to read is with the cake being vertical or else the Kindle will flip open. It is still a good product none the less. You cannot lay in bed and read without having to tightly hold the kindle or else it will flip open. Also, I wish that the kindle that a tighter hold when it is up in a position to watch movies, with any slight move the kindle can fall and slide out of the grooves. I would still buy it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first found out about this app from my phone and then I was hooked. I play it all the time. Especially when I'm bored. This app will not disappoint you. It is very addictive.
0399226907|5.0|My first encounter with Eric Carle and still my favorite. I love the unique illustrations and the charming story. It gives my child and I something beautiful to spark our interest and give us something to talk about and laugh about in the end. This is so cute! I give it as a baby shower gift all the time.
B0090EJR1K|5.0|I literally laughed at almost everything in the movie. It is very funny. If you feel like laghing you must watch this. It will make you laugh even if you don't feel like it.
0060254920|5.0|Classic wonderful story. So relatably imaginative. Every child can put themselves in the story. Max's parents don't give in to his stubbornness and it leads him on a wonderful adventure that sparks his imagination and then his appreciation for what he has. I love a story that trains a child's heart to be strong and right.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This movie is really cool and a really good perspective of the future. It is full of action and really good sci- fi effects.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Great book and awesome reading of it. Perfect voice inflection and pace. She is an amazing woman and role model!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Just as an addic is out looking for their next score, so to was I looking for where I could watch Season 3. As a late comer I became completely hooked! Like a fabulous trashy romance novel came to life. I simply couldn't put it down till I had finished it. How will we loyal fans go on till season 4?
B00AUU2KI0|5.0|I haven't seen the movie of the same name, but I certainly can see why a screenplay born of this book would earn a Best Picture nomination and Best Director win for Ang Lee. If you read \\"Life of Pi\\" in many sittings - between which your brain will naturally revert to its factory settings of skepticism, civility, and impatience - you'll likely tire of the fanciful events, gore, and pace (including a few chapters about religion that interrupt the narrative but are actually quite brief if you power through and remarkable if you spend some time truly sitting with the lines). On the other hand, if you manage to set aside time to read Yann Martel's novel in as few sittings over as few days as possible, you will leave the theater of the mind created by this book utterly rocked.<br /><br />Though the novel's most enchanting offerings are the plot and characters, it also features prose that is intricate in its simplicity and astute to boot (e.g., \\"Oncoming death is terrible enough, but worse still is oncoming death with time to spare, time in which all the happiness that was yours and all the happiness that might have been yours becomes clear to you.\\").
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|Absolutely love the game! It has realism, plus great graphics! I would definitely recommend downloading this game! It's a must for your game library!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|J. T. is the man!  This project is everything you could expect and more.  His vocals are smooth as silk and every track is on fire.  There isn't a song I don't like.  And teaming up with Timbaland the producer was the best choice he could have ever made.  By the way, you will love \\"Strawberry Bubble Gum\\"...my favorite track.  I would definitely recommemd this to others.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|Bought this product for my husband. He absolutely loves this tool. He's opted out to carry this vs his pocket knife (which he used to carry everywhere with him). Also so much cheaper on Amazon than purchasing from the bear grylls website.-- almost $30 cheaper!!<br />highly recommend this product.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Loved this book. Grabs you from the beginning and doesn't let you go. Well worth the money! No need to have read the series but I might now.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This short story is engaging and wonderful with characters you empathize with and yet another original and interesting magic system. He really is the master of fantasy.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This has helped me so much.  If you ever need a dictionary get this app.  This app is amazing when you need it.
098478280X|5.0|As an admin looking to move more into coding this book has been invaluable as it helps me understand more what companies are looking for in a coder. I found the code and questions relatable but challenging, and I learned so much from it.
098478280X|5.0|Absolutely fantastic. I converted 2 out of 3 interview calls that I had, just due to this book and nothing else. And I would have converted the third one also, had I finished the complete book and actually coded the problems, instead of just thinking and understanding the algorithms. Its like a holy book for people, for whom technology is the religion.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|I haven't used it much.  I'm not familiar with the Lep's World 1 so I still learning it.<br />It's okay so far.
B001VM0LAK|5.0|It was a very good movie from beginning to end. Loved all of the action. Bruce Willis' different looks were done real good.
0525457585|5.0|I finished this book within a 5 days! I loved it so much. Its a lot different from the movie which i've seen first but its a great story of fantasy and also a classic.
B00C1C0WCQ|5.0|Getting to see what the dinosaurs actually look like. Enjoyed watching the dinosaur going through San Diego destroying everything. The baby dinosaur was cute.
B00AGKH6D8|1.0|Just knowing Joe B. was playing on this i thought i couldn't go wrong , whoops i slipped and bumped my head or thats what i thought after hearing this whatever it is ? Comparing this to Jeff Beck is a joke! and if you want to hear some real Jazz fushion listen to John Mclaughlin and The Mahavishnu Orchestra, and the album i would recomend is The Inner Mounting Flame! Outstanding,John is so fast and doesnt miss any notes, again Jan Hammer on the piano and Jerry Goodman on electric violin and Rick Laird on the bass and to round out the band Billy Cobham on the drums, first rate funk, and you can see them live on you tube but since they split in the 1970's the film and sound won't be great but you will see what i'm talking about. I love Joe but We Want O Grove just stinks! Stick to Blues Rock Joe or try some covers like Robin Trower just did it was great, Little Red Rooster, Hound Dog, The Trill Is Gone and Born Under A Bad Sign, Joe would be great at that! he's still a kid, a damn good kid!
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Youtube video games fo<br />Rr girls in the world got a little bit more than a little bit more than a little more bones and a great deal with it is not responsible to the public sector in this country and the world got to the other
B00023GGFI|5.0|Be careful with a fool and Leland Mississippi Blues and Mean Mistreater are some of the best hard blues out there bar none!
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This 45th Anniversary Edition is amazing!!  The picture is restored from the 70 mm negative!! As great as the picture is, the sound is better!! DTS HD Master Audio!!  At this price, it's a no-brainer!!
B000002BYA|4.0|Classic Stevie Ray Vaughn and Double Trouble another of my favorite guitarist ! and this CD chuck full of his best stuff, i just didn't like whoever was working the sound boards when they recorded this it almost sounded like a bootleg or at least mine did ? still liked it ! Big-B.
0307346617|5.0|This is really a unique display of storytelling and manages to captivate you while jumping across many different stories and time periods.  This reads more like a thrilling journal article than a horror novel.  Very well written!
B00A8307BG|4.0|I just got to see Robin not long ago and it had been close to thirty years since i've seen him live before and the first time he had Jack Bruce from Cream playing with him and i still think that may of been the best show i've ever seen! perfect venue the acustics were perfect and his band was so tight like they had been playing forever, so when i saw him i thought oh god how he's aged like we all, and that first time i saw him every thing was perfect ! but i figured oh well we got a good deal on the tickets so what the hell but after a few songs i closed my eyes and i couldn't tell all the years had gone by he played as well as ever ! and his new CD is straight kick butt blues,something more guys should do, play some covers i mean, play tribute to the people that inspired them in the first place! but with this CD i was very happy! Big-B.
B008Y768XO|5.0|Was completely unfamiliar with this movie, but great quality and appropriate for a family.  What a dog!!  And based on a true story...
B005LAII80|5.0|Anthony Dod Mantle is one of the greatest cinematographers our time. Carl Urban is stellar, I hope they do a sequel.
B00AEUPOVQ|4.0|Was unfamiliar with this story, or the actors, but the movie was a nice surprise! Typical Jane Austen writing, thoroughly enjoyable.
B00B81B0HC|5.0|Rarely do I find a group that I enjoy all of their songs.  I do with Imagine Dragons.  Radioactive is by far one of my favorite songs.  My friends and I enjoy listening to a variety of genres and I have introduced them to this group.  They too love their sound.  Check them out.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its amazing but its to adicting!!!!! I love this game play it every day on my kindle while listning to music
1601251556|5.0|As always, Game Mastery products come with no less than a flawless appeal and no damage, even to my deployed location. Now the guys can see the mayhem I will impose upon them in real time. Great tool for all kinds of games as well as a sweet travel size gaming mat. Folds up to fit in a backpack which is necessary for us fine folks overseas that have to share common areas.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|Really well written, edge of your seat kind of stuff. Something for everyone- you'll love it! I read them all back to back.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Loved it! Didn't want it to end. I fell in love with the characters Definitely on my list of favorites
B002VECM6S|5.0|Watch and Learn!!!<br /><br />Had the CD before, person didn't return it to us.  We have to review the movie at least once a month.  The world would be a better place if everyone had the kind heart of that Mom, DAD and Family.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|With a great 3d tv to watch it with this movie can be better than in theaters and I saw this at the IMAX. The only con I have is that like most lord of the rings movies they can't seem to fit it all on 1 disc which can be annoying. Great film and great quality and my case was mildly scratched up but not too bad.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I like the game in general but it does have glitches. It freezes & you lose your winning. It fails to give shadow cards very often. It also fails to give you the opportunity to win an one object. It's like there is only a limited number of them & once they are gone no one else can win it. Example, in the \\"Spring Room\\" everyone is trying for the same object (seeds) and the only ones who have gotten them got it when the room opened. Also right now there is a new room (Nashville) but not everyone has it. When you do get it, 2-3 wks after the room is launched that one key item will be gone & others who just got the game room will not get the one desired object to complete the room because the people who did get the room has already gotten all objects. This is tremendously upsetting and lots of people are considering looking for a different bingo game, myself included. If you aren't currently playing I would suggest you try to find a different room.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I think Jamie did an amazing job portraying all the characters in this book. I have read it twice now and will read it again . I absolutely adore Travis and really enjoy the friendship America and pigeon share. Loved hearing Travis' side in Walking Disaster!!
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Brilliant book could not stop reading it as the plot keeps you inrigued and attached. when is #4 coming out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS APP IS AMAZAYN!!!<br />I love it it's so addicting and phenomeniall. I think every one with a tablet should seriously get this app. It's nit only fabulouis but it's also free. FREE!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I needed another cable and find only in Amazon US, because Brazilian Amazon don't have it.<br />I'ts an idea i know is usefull for Kindle's.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A great game, it is like a different kind of temple run. I love how the game changes every couple of months or so, it keeps me into it! You basically run as far as you can while collect coins. Fun, get it!
B00C1TOTK0|5.0|Okay - the problem may not be large to some; and I will tell the reader now to stop reading if they have not seen the classic ending.<br /><br />The famous finale where the boy calls out to the departing Shane to \\"Come back.  Come back, Shane!\\"  is cross faded early with the end music on the DVD version.  On the laser disc version Joey can clearly be last heard saying: \\"Goodbye Shane!\\" before the end music swells.  Perhaps not a big deal to most but when the DVD loses this last phrase I felt something was lost that was important.  I hope they fixed this on the Bluray.<br /><br />This is one of the best movies ever.  The book makes for good reading too.
B00BD2DRHW|2.0|I thought it was boring unless you're into  construction! I guess it's the female in me. Might be ok if I were younger.
B00985E3UG|5.0|This might not be anything new for many people, but the repercussions of putting all this information in together would be likely to leave many with the notion that something needs to be done. Moss presents the information well, and the information is important. Please give this a read. Please allow this to be a catalyst in better decisions--whatever they may be. I highly recommend this!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a wonderful adventure into a mind of a different struggling freshman in high school trying to fit in. Filled with wonderful lines that will stay with you. A honest must read!
B000002H97|5.0|and great price.  I love doing business here at this site. I will recommend this to all my music loving friends.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This was very helpful when I made a trip to PA to visit with my son.  The weather was very bad where we were at and having the weather channel I was able to get the weather for the cities on my route ahead of time.
B0031TZ8TU|5.0|This is an incredible book that is full of history and is easy to read.  I find it hard to put down.  I love ken follett books and this is definitely one of my favorites.
B00992CF6W|3.0|This app is great, but I'm really bothered because joining games is difficult. An iPod can't join my games, it won't work. Please fix this soon!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This book is a good read from beginning to end. The action keeps a steady pace, while allowing you to develop a relationship with the characters. Can't wait to read the next book!
B00170KA0C|5.0|The story was about an art teacher who left where she was and went to a conservative female private liberal art college to teach. She was facing extremely wealthy and excellent female students who will preview the course content entirely and almost will recite everything in the text book. There was no need to teach what was supposed to be taught so she took the chance to teach modern art. She got into trouble because these students' parents will come in to talk to principle about her teaching. She did not only teach art. She also taught her students how to think differently and how to pursue their career ambition. One student got married and answered her that being a home maker was her life long ambition and her choice. She left the school after one year. This story was about 1954 but now 2013 seldom female will choose home keeper as their life long ambition. This story will make me think about the balance between home and career.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|this game is an amazing sequel to the original cut the rope and cut the rope experiments, get ready to be teleported to the time traveling ancestors
B0067TGSOK|3.0|I started reading this book and was very inspired. The first half of the book was great, good advice (while may seem simple and logical yes sometimes it helps to point it out.) And I loved the examples and stories, helped make it seem more attainable. About halfway thru the book I got lost, bored, reading it seemed tedious. Maybe at this point it would have been better to have had an idea in motion in order to keep relating to the book. Overall I enjoyed it tho.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just discovered this game. It was fast and easy to download not to mention free. My four year old daughter and I love to play it. The graphics are wonderful and the game is extremely entertaining. Thanks again. I strongly recommend this game. It's great for the whole family to play.
B004RUF9DC|2.0|The movie is good, but don't bother with the blu ray. This is high def? Worst blu ray transfer I've ever seen.
B0067R0APK|1.0|Maps and radar does not work.  Less features with the paid app then in their free version I deleted to pay for this one...
B004NELBPC|3.0|The recently released version is inconsistent in the font sizes displayed. Some are so small to be unreadable.<br />Content is still worth trying to read.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|I heard from friends and reviewers how great this movie is, but the previews made it look so cheesy. So when I finally saw it, I was blown away! The preview is usually a seletion of the best scenes of a movie. This film is so much deeper and artistic than I could imagine. I Love it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Just as fun as the first two, if not even better than them.  Having two On Noms to feed makes it more challenging.
B004SOR4H6|2.0|I have searched this app high and low and still have not been able to sign out.  There is no menu button available either.  I tried to go into the device settings to clear the data and cache. Still nothing.
0765348276|5.0|I just spent a pleasant, rainy afternoon on my back patio, finishing \\"Old Man's War\\" by John Scalzi, which I read on Kindle for iPad.  It was Scalzi's first novel, and reads like it was written by a master.  If you liked The Forever War by Joe Haldeman, or the original Starship Troopers, you'll like \\"Old Man's War.\\"  Now I have to check out the sequels -- hopefully the library has some for loan, as there are a lot of them.<br /><br />Basically the plot line is that on a future Earth, everyone at age 75 is allowed to volunteer for off-planet military service. Very little is known about it, other than the rumor that the military has the ability to make people younger.<br /><br />Not quite. Instead, your consciousness is downloaded into a cloned body that's been upgraded with fancy DNA.  You're nearly super-human. That's the good news. The bad news is the military does this for a reason -- war against various alien baddies is constant, and the aliens have no trouble killing even advanced humans. And if you die in space, this time it's for keeps.<br /><br />Highly readable, enjoyable characters, the prose is sparse but also beautifully descriptive and he knows the story he wants to tell and how to get there.  Highly recommended if you're a fan of military sci-fi.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|This app looked pretty good at first glance. As a artist it would be much better if you buy a pen for your kindle. That ends up to a grand total of 7$-30$. That is what you are really paying for the app. Consider that. P.S. I am heather's daughter, Anna, age eleven.
B003RYA17I|5.0|This is a most unique collection of old Celtic music played on the appropriate instruments. Some from known composers like O'Carolan and others long forgotten.  The sets are well put together and the musicianship of the players superb.  The CD production is excellent with a multi lingual guide to the tunes together with historical notes on the music and the composers.  Thank you for the opportunity to comment.  Dave whaley
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I like it.  Was one of those books that you didn't figure all the aspects of the plot within a few chapters.  I enjoyed it.
B00B89WXYS|4.0|\\"Native\\" by OneRepublic is another gorgeous masterpiece to add to your collection.  OneRepublic is traditionally an alternative rock band and I've loved many of their past songs from their previous albums, including my all-time favorite \\"Good Life.\\"  They are my favorite band by far compared to anyone else.  When I first heard the music to this album, I wasn't really impressed because it seemed so different than the past two albums.  However, after a little bit more listening, I started really enjoying the music and my love from OneRepublic lit back up.  Now, I enjoy pretty much all the songs on the album and listen to them everyday, including the moment I'm writing this review.  OneRepublic's song variety in this album is great, with some harder alternative rock and even some opera and everything inbetween.  In all honesty, the wild animal theme was perfect for this album because the music is great and, like always, Ryan Tedder sings with so much passion alongside a talented band.  In conclusion, I rate this 4 stars instead of 5 because if you have listened to the two previous albums, the music in this album sounds like a completely new genre than the usual OneRepublic at first.  However, take a few listens and that couple of dollars will so be worth it!  LONG LIVE ONEREPUBLIC!!!!
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|a little boring but ok.  Sally Fields was interesting. Who ever played Lincoln was a bit dull. Should have found a better actor.
8866135909|1.0|Bought this for my wife who is visually challenged. The print is so light that she is unable to see the numbers. This product needs a redo.
B006PTZNQQ|5.0|I never heard of Nikki until Idol and like her so much I wanted to purchase a cd. I did order the clean version cause I'm 67 and need that but it's awesome.
B001G50SLE|5.0|Love this series mainly for Jensen Ackles. .. the only down side to this series is when they \\"talk\\" about their feelings... Dean holds it in too much and Sam is too sensitive. The fighting monsters thing is really cool plus they poke fun at themselves from time to time.  Watch Supernatural!!!
B0047CTO9A|5.0|I have watched Nikki on Idol and really like her so I wanted to see what her cd would be like. I ordered the clean version (I'm 67) and frankly I feel really gyped because all of the songs on the regular cd are not on this version including her most popular hit which I listened to on my daughters music and doesn't seem to have any offensive lyrics at all. So my advice to others is if you can at all be more thick skinned than me buy the regular version of the CD.
B0064SHI9I|1.0|Worked to backup the install for all of my apps but it didn't backup any of the data for those apps.<br />I also backed up my bookmarks but when I restored them it didn't work.<br />Very disappointing.
B009GJBEF6|4.0|this bond has everything..tongue in cheek humor, action , q,gadgets  ..etc  a little political  corectiveness  with M and moneypenny . but a good flick
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|This book is an easy read and good advice.  I don't think you should ask us to write long reviews on everything.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|A fast read - I couldn't put it down and read it in record time. The story takes a few twists and turns that keep one on the edge of one's seat. A very enjoyable read with an exciting conclusion.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was a great and sweet little book. It's not one that you would necessarily \\"never want to put down\\" but every time I picked it up I had a new adventure to read. It's a very relatable book with great, well-rounded characters. I would definitely recommend top teenagers!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved what Peter Jackson did with the Lord of the Rings, and I think he has done it again with the Hobbit. The cinematography, both live and computer generated, is excellent, and aesthetically well composed. This is lighter fare than LOTR, as it should be, and I love it that he was able to include more of Tolkien's songs. The script propels the action at a good pace, and I find it to be over way too soon. The extended \\"blogs\\" on the second disc are fun, although not quite as satisfying at the material on the LOTR discs.
B00992CF6W|5.0|i bought this a couple hours ago and im hooked!! its sooooooo awesome i already made two small houses, two different worlds: a hunger games theme and a percy jackson/camp half-blood theme!! thanks mojang for this AMAZING app!!!!! and i also discovered LOTS of things!! i made a couple of under groud tunnels too!! LOVE THIS APP!! BUY IT NOW!!!:D
B0012BQ60O|5.0|Adds to any mythology collection. Colorful and durable. These pieces are authentic looking and very detailed. Every kid would love this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway surfers is awesome, and I think it's cool, and love it very much subway surfers is all of these things
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Giving this movie a one star is too much in my opinion, if amazon allowed the option of 0 star, that's the rating I would pick. This movie is not only incredibly stupid but in all honesty, it does not feel like a movie. It feels like you're watching a series of small clips who seem to follow one another. The sequence of the movie is extremely poor and the watching experience is not smooth. Clips are just randomly thrown at you from all corners.<br /><br />One of my biggest problem with this movie was the dialog, none of the characters seem to talk like actual people. For goodness-sake, NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT. Their conversations are incredibly abstract, unnecessarily deep, and cloudy. Each of the characters have a lot going on but none of it are things you care about. Whoever wrote the script of this movie needs to be fired asap.<br /><br />What's worst are the moral hazards supported within this film:<br /><br />1) According to cat-woman, its perfectly ok to steal from those who have more. Not taking into account that those who have wealth worked for it, and those who are poor don't produce much. Being poor is not an excuse to steal, it shows you are too lazy and impatient to acquire things the correct way so you resolve to robbing others for what they have worked for.<br />2) The movie is socialist by nature. For it demonizes the wealthy as if they are rich at the expense of the poor. People are not rich by accident, one gets rich through smarts, efforts, and sacrifices that the poor refuse to do. No one gets rich by demand, the rich earned their wealth. To demonize rich people is a bad lesson to teach our young.<br />3) Even though cat-woman is a low life untrustworthy thief, batman is into her and begs for her cooperation. (What kind of hero is that?)<br />4) Bruce Wayne gets angry at Alfred (the man who cared for him his whole life) because he hid a love letter from a woman who clearly rejected him. That is totally not OK and ungrateful.<br />5) The movie legitimizes that without a police force, poor people are barbarians who sentence the wealthy to death simply because of what they have. That is very condescending towards the poor.<br /><br />The list of moral hazards in this movie are endless but I rather not continue. The conclusion is that this movie subliminally teaches the public a very wrong and destructive concept of reality. Most Poor people are not barbaric savages waiting to jump on the rich the moment they get a chance, and most rich people are not snobby obnoxious individuals stomping on the poor to acquire and maintain wealth. In fact, the rich individuals are often the most productive and provide a wide array of benefits to the poor. Outside the moral hazards, there is very little intelligence behind this movie. In other words, the movie is plain dumb and stupid. It's a shame to see mainstream entertainment come down to this level. This movie gets -1 Star.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Couldn't wait to get to the next episode.  John Lithgow was superb.  Would highly recommend to any Dexter fan.  Ending was definite surprise.
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|Venetia, along with A Civil Contract, goes well beyond usual Regency romance formulas. It's wonderful fun (especially Heyer's deflation of a pompous suitor), but it also represents pain and loneliness, even hopelessness -- and the true sexuality of two souls who have found each other.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Always trying to find movies my husband and I are both willing to see together.  This one is pretty good!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A friend of mine Jay told me this W's better than Temple Run.  I got this and took the challenge.  Great game for reflects.  Traffics are amazing.  I love w<br />hen the cop picks you up and throws you over his shoulder!
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Yea, just that. A Beautiful story that really captures the time and space in which the book was written (middle XIX century). And deliver thoroughly the felling of loneliness, passion, melancholy and change. Totally recommend it to anyone that likes, even if a little bit, dramas, melodramas or books with great messages on human nature.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|This book explores what the consequences are of being a criminal in a connected world. I can't wait to see the movie.
B00BD2DRHW|5.0|Its a nice time pass app... works good, i guess kids will like it for sure without a doubt.. go!
B000FA675C|5.0|I am a Dan Brown fan and Da Vinci Code: A Novel featuring Robert Langdon was another very good book.  It is action packed and has a great mystery/discovery theme clear to the end.
B00BAVCD8A|4.0|I am signed up to get emails from FOB and when it popped up in my inbox that they had a new single/ album coming out, I hopped on board for a pre-order. \\"Folie\\" got me through writing a particular piece when it first came out and I was in a mind that this album would serve as the background music to breathing life into a different take on the story. Sadly, only a few songs from the album are going to end up doing this. As many noted, their singles are quite different than the rest of the album. I am not a fan of most of the collaborations (as they are sung in a way that's hard to understand what's being said) and many of the arrangements aren't so much rock as they are indie pop. Yes, FOB has indie roots, but I expected a little more of the heavy hitting sound of rock and roll. Patrick's voice is still beautiful as always and the lyrics of many of the songs are poignant and just \\"rock and roll\\" enough, but this is an album that can settle in next to other pop/rock/indie releases rather than doing any \\"saving\\" on its own. If you're expecting old FOB, this is not the album for you. If you're not for artist collaborations, this is not the album for you. Overall, I give this album a 4 out of 5 and am glad for the band's return.
B004NELBPC|5.0|An excellent source of information everyday; clear, well balanced and handy. An antidote to some of the garbage floating around the 'Net.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|At first its kind of hard to understand which family is associated with a kingdom but it gets easier. I love the plots and i am barely in season 1, i cant wait to finish them all this show is so addictive.
B004E2XAFW|4.0|I bought this for the song Faster and was hoping to find more songs on it that I liked as much but actually the longer you listen to the cd the more redundant it sounds.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Great for using old power cords with new Macs. Small and easy to use. Good to carry one in your bag in case you need it.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very well done and just how I imagined it when I read the books, cant wait for the rest to be made!
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|This book is like Paul Rudd. I see the appeal, and I would never take it away from anyone. But I would also never stand in line for it.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|for a lonesome moment, this fills the bill.  my granddaughter has the talking panda on kindle and they interact, it's fun
B0067AC5KA|3.0|The first book was great, the other 2 I had trouble getting through them.  I don't think the last 2 books lived up to the promise of the first book.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Very interesting story.  I think many different groups of people will like this.  Such a humble man who expects nothing
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is an awesome game... I love the way that coins are easy to get and the people are fun to switch up. I enjoy the world traveling section but I can't get to Sydney Australia! That really bugs me... when it's holidays the theme will change and gets me little brother excited. Excellent game! I hope y'all like it too.
B003DBOS7Y|5.0|Touching story.  If you need a good cry, watch this movie.  It is a very simple story but the acting very good.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Provides good direction and tips on how to publish a book using KDP. I like the way KDP is setup and so much more easier than other Online Publishing.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I enjoyed this game so much. When I got it I couldn't stop playing it. I eventually ran my kindle dead. Yeah, it's that good. Different characters can be unlocked and different boards can be purchased as well. The graphics are wonderfully amazing and I simply adore the art style! I'd recommend this to anyone looking for simple entertaining game.
0525425578|5.0|The Theodore Boone series is a young adult series Grisham has out there. I'll admit, I'm a thirty-two year old male and I love the Boone series. Very well written and thought out. Suspenseful and compelling.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Amazing, I love everything about it. The second time reading it and it was even better. The walking dead S3 is over and I had to get my zombie fix!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have always been a Nicholas Sparks fan.  He truly keeps his readers captivated.  Just another wonderful novel by him.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Streaming movies is very convenient and the quality is great.  A teeny bit of buffering delay,but not a biggie.  Lovely movie.
B0000TB014|5.0|My kids love jammin to the cd version of this collection in my car so I bought the dvd for them and they can now have dance parties to all of the Michael Jackson songs they love. My only complaint is that I do wish this had subtitles with lyrics but otherwise it's a fantastic collection of his most loved hits and it's great to have a professional edition of his videos too. It's Michael can't give it less than 5 stars...
B0064MGU98|4.0|Good storyline, great acting, a little edgy at times. This series keeps you coming back and it is usually very full of surprises.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is fun for the road so you are not bored I have it on ky phone and nook and kindle fire love it
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|James Bond, what not to like.  This movie had a little more plot than most and was suspenseful.  Although Daniel Craig is not my favorite Bond, I really enjoyed him in this one.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is so fun you choose the person whose hair you want to do then you do it you can wash color straighten curl and decorate their hair I recommend you get this game.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's a classic. I need to read it in order to understand better the musical movie. The kindle application works perfect on the 4&#34; screen of my Motorola Atrix
B009AMANBA|5.0|Saw it in the movie theater and thought it was worth purchasing and enjoyed watching it at home with family!!!
0393340244|5.0|Interesting read, well documented, well researched, engaging and thought provoking. Many things make sense after reding it. I definitely recommend it.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|At times this books was difficult to read due to the strong emotions, but I couldn't put it down. I read it over one weekend.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The movie is well done, visually pleasing and enjoyable.  How they managed to divide a realtively short book into 2 movies (this one ran over 2 hours!) is beyond me.  This movie ends in the middle of the story (for those who have read the book).  The next part comes out in late 2013.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Having had a thrity year career in a major corporation, this book was right on. A must read for everybody.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|This book was different than the first three.  All of the expected characters are there.  There is almost no action in this book--only plotting and scheming.  The book ends rather abruptly without bringing any single story line to a close.  If you enjoyed the first three, read this book, but expect to be left hanging at the end.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Five year old Grandson loves this game.. I buy these so when he is with me he goes through my kindle to see what is new, this  one he went crazy over.  Just loves it.<br />Darlene Bachand
B008JGSM6G|5.0|When I start playing it I can't stop. Can be very challenging .It puts my mind in gear .I play it for hours at a time and it only seam like it was a few minutes.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|Was a bit disappointed as it did not have the classic Boz Scaggs oomph. Good listening though but missing that bit of punch. Still don't regret buying it.
B000JQUMPI|5.0|Even though I bout this book for me I have enjoyed the book.  do not regret my personnal choice of this book and will cherish it always.
B00B23O96A|2.0|A very big let down. But then again, Eric Clapton has done a lot for his type of music and to continue to expect the same would be unfair. I had an expectation which was not met.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|Fun! One of the better games on amazon. It's a turn based card game. It's worth taking a look at.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I loved Downton Abbey Season 3!! The visit to Scotland is gorgeous and all the plots are well paced throughout. I did not want Season 3 to end!  The final scene is so tragic that it stops your heart.  Some viewers may feel that the series have had too many characters dying, but the latest tragic death had to be written into the end of Season 3...one of the main characters did not want to renew the contract for Season 4!  So the poor writers had to literally &#34;kill off&#34; the character! That news should make you feel that you must watch Season 3 to see who is not coming back!
B000JQU1VS|5.0|This classic work is both interesting and informative, my dear Watson. The stories vary, but all are intriguing, showcasing the observation skills of the Master Detective. Truth be known, Dr Watson contributed much to the work, and I believe he was an actual person. Holmes had a drug habit, not illegal at that time, and probably an effort to hold his tremendous intellect in check. Eventually, he overcame it, and took a few years sabbatical, as it were, where he dropped out of sight to peruse the world cultures outside of England. I enjoyed reviewing the stories again, having read them years ago as a erstwhile detective. Some might say the book is \\"elementary\\" but the depth is cleverly hidden.<br />JDM>Ap2013
B00785P2QC|4.0|I love the game. Takes awhile to get coins if you don't spend real cash. I wish the coins c and much faster to build your town a little faster
B004J4WKTW|5.0|We read this for my book club.  We all loved it.  We can't wait to see the movie!  Different than anything I've read in a long time.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I had no idea this was such a great series! I absolutely loved watching the first season. The second season has already been ordered and is on it's way!
B009UWYFFK|5.0|My family and I love this movie.  We have movie nights once a week and this has been THE movie for a long time.
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|I had to take the &#34;middle road&#34; and give three stars for this movie.<br /><br />Pros: It had a great theme and there were places that made me actually &#34;jump out of my seat!&#34; It was realistic in the continued weight loss of both the lion and the boy. I got the movie in 3D and the intro was really breath taking!<br /><br />Cons: I couldn't understand much of the conversation in the first part of the movie.Iit was very boring and shot in some low light settings which combined with the low, muffled and heavily accented speech made the movie impossible for me to understand what was taking place!  I couldn't get into the movie until the &#34;action&#34; began. I still had a hard time understanding the actor but the action made up for that. After the breath taking intro, I didn't notice very much if any 3D effect throughout the rest of the movie.<br /><br />All in all, this movie was &#34;just ok&#34; but it could have been excellent if  the directors had enhanced the speech so I could have understood what they were saying. :-(
B009QW7YEI|5.0|I've always been a James Bond fan and I have a sweet spot for Mr. Brosnan, so I've always loved this movie. I was really excited to see it amongst several other Bond films added to Prime, so that I could watch it for free any time via my Roku - hurray! Unfortunately, it didn't stream very well, which is unusual for Amazon Instant Videos, in my experience. It stuttered, paused, wouldn't unpause, and when it did start playing again, more than once, there was no sound. What the heck??  I actually had to completely back out of Amazon and back in to get to the movie twice. Crazy! I thought perhaps it was a quirk of the Roku in my room, but I had the same problem when I tried from other Roku in a different room. Maybe Amazon was having some trouble that day? Not sure. If I didn't otherwise always have great experiences with Instant Videos, I don't think I would have ever tried it again. So, I guess this is more of a review of the Instant Video experience than the movie - because I LOVE this movie and struggled through all the technical difficulties just to watch it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I purchased this movie in 3D based on my grandson's recommendation. I expected &#34;just another weird movie&#34; for young people!  But at least it would mean spending time with our grand kids. As it turned out, they all had to work the week end we planned to watch it so their parents came and we all watched it. It was amazing. We all loved the movie. It has a great theme and kept us all captivated. The 3D was good, though not as defined as some of the more cartoonish type movies but none the less it was still very much an asset and enhanced the action in this movie.<br /><br />It you want a excellent family movie, I highly recommend Avatar for young and old alike!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This movie is such an amazing movie. Very happy that i brought it. like lord of the rings. truly fantastic

B0064QNS62|1.0|Considering it was free... I don't have bad things to say about this app. I just personally don't like it.  :-(
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I've always been a bigger fan of The Hobbit than Lord of the Rings, and this first-of-three Hobbit movies was better than I expected. The dwarves are way more fleshed out than in the book. Peter Jackson did a great job of introducing a few of his own touches to an already great book while keeping the old Tolkein flavor. Favorite scene: the dwarves singing the Misty Mountain song.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game. The game has obstacles everywhere you turn. Its a REAL challange when you play it in the car.
B004NELBPC|2.0|New update increases photo size and decreases font size so that it is nearly unreadable.  I'll be finding another source of news to read on my Kindle Fire.

0425263908|2.0|NOTE: POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br />A good book is one that makes you forget that you are reading words on a page, where you become so caught up in it that it feels like you're watching real scenes unfold before you. I didn't get that with this book and I wasn't able to get lost in it. Some reasons why:<br /><br />The hero was not well-developed or likable. There were a bunch of words to describe how unbelievably good-looking he was and the heroine repeated 100 times that he was so gorgeous, beautiful, the best looking guy she's ever seen etc.. but he honestly didn't come across as sexy at all. He never said or did anything that made me feel excited or turned on. There is nothing sexy about a man who feels the need to spend ever minute of the day with his girl. There's sexy possessive and then there's smothering possessive. Our heroine couldn't even go to the gym on her own as he felt the need to go with her and could not use any other treadmill except the one right next to hers (seriously?). That's not romantic that's nauseating (and this was a few days after they met). Yes people change when they find love, but its hard to believe that a smart, successful, confident man, who crudely proposes no strings sex to a stranger, and who has spent most of his adult life using women and viewing them as sexual objects, suddenly becomes infatuated, jealous, clingy and needy(overnight) after his first date with a girl. The type of men that act this way are usually insecure, anxious or suffering from low self-esteem.<br /><br />Additionally, our main man is 28 years old and apparently owns most of Manhattan- he owned the building where she worked, the building where she lived, the nightclub she danced at, the gym he exercised at, the hotel near the gym where he screwed randoms. I like a rich man, but I found myself thinking \\"Are you f***ing kidding me?\\" every time he opened his mouth claiming to own yet another location or property.<br /><br />The first sex scene was hot, but then I became bored. When the characters are screwing five times a day it just becomes repetitive. There was no build-up of sexual tension, no moments where you are panting for them to hook up, because they were having sex ALL THE FREAKING TIME. They  would finish having raging sex and minutes later he wants her again. No matter how tired, angry, bloated....they still had this urgent need to rip each others clothes off with the same intensity each time and eventually I found myself skipping pages because it all sounded like the same crap. It didn't help that he kept constantly repeating how much he wanted her and how he needed to be inside her during each sex scene, until it no longer sounded sexy, just desperate.<br /><br />Ok, couples counselling after 1 week of a relationship? Recreating her room in his house? Some of these ideas made me roll my eyes or snort. What made me feel uncomfortable however was the superficial understanding of sexual abuse. For some reason, both main characters had been sexually abused (along with her roommate). Im not sure what the significance of this was, perhaps to show how common child sexual abuse is, but you would expect that if both characters struggled with the same form of adversity, then the underlying trauma would be illustrated much more profoundly. Instead, the book skimmed the issue, and in my personal opinion, portrayed an inaccurate representation of the impact of sexual abuse on adult survivors. The heroine was sexually abused for 4 years from the age of 10 years old. It is briefly described as a traumatic event in her life that still appears to affect her (ie nightmare re perpertrator) so her immense enjoyment of being dominated sexually was confusing. The hero sexually propositioned her the day they met and she was turned on by this. Within a week, they were not only having rough, crude sex, but he sexually attacked her a few times (ie to shut her up during an argument). It is hard to believe that she would be that trusting during sex (being held down etc)with someone she has known for 1 week, after she was repeatedly sexually abused as a child; or that she would be comfortable being watched engaging in public sex on two separate occassions to the point of orgasm (both times). Then there's the scene where he attacks her while they're both asleep and she thinks it is the perpertrator and becomes distressed. She then goes back to sleep, wakes up a short time later during the night, and initiates sex with him to help her forget the experience - huh???  The hero on the other hand wants to be her Dom, which makes sense for a sexually abused male. However, when the Sub in question is a sexually abused female, her somewhat laid back response to his propostion of sexually controlling her was quite puzzling.
B00000JLEP|2.0|Once you've heard Svetlanov conducting this piece, with nothing less than an absolutely volcanic passion, and then Gergiev's performance which doesn't lag far behind in terms of sheer voluptuousness, you are forever spoilt for the kind of \\"gentlemanly\\" music making as Boulez produces here. Heaven bless the Chicago Symphony, but hiring this metronome-besotted time beater was a huge mistake, explained only by a prestige that induces many people to shot their ears when they don't like what they hear - after all, this is the \\"great\\" Boulez! It does remind me, sorry to say, of the tale of the Emperor's clothes.<br />All the performances on this album are marked by a reticence and indeed tiredness which stands at the opposite end of an apposite approach. This is Scriabin, after all, a musical revolutionary, seeking to enlarge the expressive power of music by a new harmonic language and highly differentiated instrumental colours. With due allowances made for the fin de siecle temper that infested others as well (Busoni, Schoenberg, Mahler etc.), a good way of thinking of this music is of a creative mind seeking to burst open the thinning skin of traditional forms and harmony. In short, this music represents part of an adventure, a journey of discovery, and it wasn't driven by politeness, but by impulsiveness, impetuosity, impatience and a talent for the exotic and extraordinary.<br />Boulez, himself a radical in his youth, seems to have turned progressively into a fossil as he made increasing forays into the classical repertoire. Those who remember the excitement of his earlier years, when his Bartok, Ravel and Debussy were still revelatory, will groan with dismay at this colourless, uninvolved, stale exhibition of conductorial expertise. Even Ormandy, by no means at home in Scriabin, turned in a more apt performance for RCA. So now we have Poem of Ecstasy without ecstasy, a Poem of Fire without fire and a Piano Concerto that sounds for all the world like a youthful essayof Chopin.<br />I have my doubts that this is what the world needed.

B004SIIBGU|3.0|This app is kind of mediocre to be honest. It is more convenient than trying to access ebay through the kindle browser, so I can't say it's completely horrible. I don't like the browsing experience with this app, though. Narrowing down your results is often troublesome and you can't specify shoe size, color, etc. I also get very frustrated because my app always says &quot;you have just been outbid&quot; even when I'm the high bidder. Same this in the &quot;my ebay&quot;/&quot;bidding&quot; tab, the items always show up as me being outbid even if I'm not. Long story short, this could use some major improvements, but it's alright for basic functions.

B004BSFC6Y|3.0|I saw an article recommending this product then I ordered it immediately. They're really adorable and made from great concept. One of my cousin who was pregnant told me she'd like to have them, too.<br /><br />But they're not like socks which have a &#34;foot shape&#34; to help with fitting. They're not easy to put on, but quite easy for baby to pull them off.

B008220C38|1.0|WIERD A** FILM.  Why is everything filmed on a stage? Why are they deconstructing the story? Why not just show it? Very disappointed. The best Ana Karenina film was in the 90's with Sophie Marceau and Sean Bean. Now that's a movie.

B000001FT2|4.0|When she was in Italy for his cover of La Vie en Rose, all thought it would be an episode of disco music, destined to end. And instead of that panther with its charm at night, has been able to collaborate with Sly & Robbie, Trevorn Horn and Brian Eno, producing wonderful albums and suspended between the electronics and the arcane, and the new vawe. Then the presence and voice are unmatched.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Fantastic read! Evocative, funny, and very sad. Maybe too sad for some, but it is not gratuitous sadness. Loved it.
B0044DEAUA|3.0|I am a little disappointed with this device, and in fairness I am not sure if it totally SuperTooth or Windows phone. I have a TON of problems with the voice recognition which is a huge hassle. I do not want to have to dial my phone while driving, the voice recognition on any given day will work fine and other days give the most bizarre reading of what I said and dial a wrong number. It is infuriating to say the least. Same way with text messaging, I have had once a near perfect rendition of a text message and other times it does not even attempt to read it. I don't have another smartphone to test with and my total experience is based on using a Nokia Lumia running Windows Phone 7.5
B009FZFONO|3.0|Great Box; but it is flimsy.  Works great, great design, practical, holds and organizes stuff.  But because it is flimsy, it is hard to close, and open without extra care or effort.  I wish the bottom were deep enough to hold spray cans of choke/gun cleaner.  Some compartments or separators would be nice in the bottom also.<br />Other than those suggestions/issues, I am glad I have one, I use it every time I shoot/clean/work on, guns.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Best film I've seen in a long time. Acting was brilliant across the board, the storyline was real, funny, tragic, sad and one everyone can relate to on some level. The chemistry between Bradley and Jennifer was scorching. This is one of those movies many people will watch over and over.
B0000029AP|5.0|Toys In The Attic, Rocks, and in some cases, Pump, are considered to be Aerosmith's best and most hard-rocking albums to date, and I think it's an appropriate statement. This was the first of the original six Aerosmith albums of the 1970s that I managed to get my hands on, so I definitely have a soft spot for it. Soft spot aside though, this really is a great album. This has nine great tracks that won't leave your head easily.<br /><br />Toys In The Attic - Great way to start off an album. Hard-rocking, cool riff, and a catchy chorus that you'd want to shout to.<br /><br />Uncle Salty - Slowing things down a bit for now, but we're just getting started. Uncle Salty is one of Tom Hamilton's greatest songwriting credits to Aerosmith's catalog of songs. It's also got one of the best guitar solos on the whole album.<br /><br />Adam's Apple - I don't know how to describe this other than just saying it's incredible. Simply incredible.<br /><br />Walk This Way - One of the band's most iconic songs. It's got funky riffs, rapidly sang lyrics, and guitar solos that'll blow you away.<br /><br />Big Ten Inch Record - This cover of a Bull Moose Jackson classic is a bluesy, upbeat track that is really hard not to move to. The song is so catchy. Too bad it's only two minutes and sixteen seconds long. I could listen to it all day.<br /><br />Sweet Emotion - The band's first big hit with one of the most legendary bass intros known to music. It's also got great riffs all throughout the song and awesome lyrics by Steven Tyler that details his hatred for Joe Perry's girlfriend at the time.<br /><br />No More No More - Another really upbeat song that's hard to sit still to while listening to it. It's got really cool lyrics to sing along to and it's got a hard-rocking guitar solo at the end that'll make you want to listen to it again.<br /><br />Round And Round - The heaviest song on the album. It's got a somewhat trippy acid rock feel to it as well. Great rocker.<br /><br />You See Me Crying - My favorite song on the album, which is saying a lot. This is an absolutely beautiful and greatly written power ballad that closes this album in an incredible way that could leave you speechless.<br /><br />This album is highly praised for a good reason, it's spectacular to say the least. If you don't have this album already, then you must buy it. You will DEFINITELY not regret it. You'd be in for a really good time.

B006O5YHUY|3.0|I want my money back! I paid top-dollar for in-ring seats at the biggest MMA event of the year and all the fights are rigged! That's all I have to say about this brutal lovefest, which follows two fighters on the road to \\"Sparta\\"; a multi-day tournament in which the winner gets a whopping five-million dollars to spend on whatever he needs.<br /><br />The woes of their lives; the financial and psychological misfortunes that are supposed to make us cheer them on; serve as the hook. And the twist; the one and only aspect of the plot that makes it different than all those other fight flicks; is that they share the same father; a former alcoholic abuser trying, unsuccessfully, to mend his past.<br /><br />The fighting action; the actual in-ring combat; is entertaining and realistic. Ringside commentators make it almost like watching real UFC fights. But the movie's emotional element is anything but tough. So the crowd-pleasing outcomes of those matches are unrealistic and anticlimatic; and clich&eacute; and predictable; all the way to the scripted end.<br /><br />marcellee.com

0307951529|4.0|This book illustrates how truly the Internet has enabled people to live their dreams: to make a lot of money with minimal work hours, be their own boss, and travel the world, living all over the globe while making money from all over. The author gives numerous case studies from people he interviewed and it will boggle your mind all the creative ways people have come up with to be financially independent and free.<br /><br />The basic premise is, \\"If you make your business about helping others, you'll always have plenty of work.\\" The model which all people he interviewed met the following criteria: they followed their passion, had a low start-up cost, and made at least $50,000 a year. The business couldn't require special skills, and they couldn't have over five employees.<br /><br />The magic formula is that passion or skill and usefulness to others equals success. The benefit of the product/service should be put in emotional terms, as in \\"We're not just selling horse rides, but an escape, freedom, etc.\\" The author teaches the reader to make a compelling offer; it's not about a hard sell, but rather an invitation to an offer that can't be refused.<br /><br />Each chapter contains info-boxes, introductory quotes, and key points at the end. The book is loaded with strategies, tips, case studies (including disastrous failures to learn from), and much more. The book is divided into three parts: examples of entrepreneurs; the business plan (includes a one-page plan, launching strategies, and how to promote); and how to expand. At the end is an appendix with many, many true life examples of people and their businesses that fit this criteria.<br /><br />This is certainly a great guide for any wannabe or even beginning entrepreneur.<br /><br />Susan Schenck, author of The Live Food Factor: The Comprehensive Guide to the Ultimate Diet for Body, Mind, Spirit & Planet<br />and<br />Beyond Broccoli, Creating a Biologically Balanced Diet When a Vegetarian Diet Doesn't Work
B00B7FWWNA|2.0|This movie got some very positive press before its release, so I was looking forward to watching it. To my disappointment the story wasn't very believable and characters were somewhat flat. I expected Helen Hunt to shine in this film; however, her character seemed bored and cold. If it wasn't for William H. Macy, who nailed his role beautifully, this movie would have been closer to a straight-to-dvd material.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my horse<br /> I rate a 5 because it is a very good game to play and never any problems!<br />I also love this game I think everyone would enjoy it.<br />I would recomnd it for everyone.
B004I2K4DY|4.0|I have seen this concert many, many times and each time I watch it, I enjoy it more and more. The music is so beautiful it makes me cry. I have it on my I-Pod and play it constantly. Just a joy to own and be able to watch whenever you want to.<br /><br />Rocco T.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|If you're a fan of the Sherlock Holmes stories, and don't object to a well-done transformation of the theme, then you are likely to really enjoy this series.  The acting is superb, the stories are compelling, and the whole thing just reeks of excellence and attention to detail.<br /><br />I've been a fan of the Holmes stories since I was a little boy, having read all of them multiple times, and have watched the various film versions over the years.  I've enjoyed some of them:  I'm not a big fan of the Basil Rathbone versions, and I quite disliked the Guy Ritchie/Robert Downey versions. I think that the recent re-imagining done in this series and in the British series (by Gatiss/Moffat, with Benedict Cumberbatch & Martin Freeman) are excellent, and hugely enjoyable if you're not offended by the variation from the canonical texts.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The middle of the book was a bit drawn out but understaning this is about his son so I was patient. The ending was unexpected so overall it was good.

B006C45CFG|5.0|It is an intensely action packed movie.  Also a sci-fi thriller. The ending was  not what I would have expected.  A great movie for the person who loves westerns and sci-fi movies combined.

B00B7IJDMA|4.0|I have liked a lot of the music they have played during episodes of &#34;Walking Dead&#34;. My main reason for buying the CD was &#34;Lead Me Home&#34; and &#34;Parting Glass&#34; sung by the two cast members that did it on the show. Both songs are excellent. I will say &#34;Lead Me Home&#34; is a pretty short song but still worth buying. There are some other songs and instrumental music that is good, too. I went into it knowing I wanted those two songs, so I figured if I didn't like anything else on it I was okay with that, but there are a couple others I do listen to. Overall, good CD purchase.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I didn't want it to end :(  It kept my attention.  Best love story in awhile.  It was an awesome adult love story.
B007I1Q4W2|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when you see something call itself \\"Exit Humanity: a Zombie Saga\\" I'll admit it was the \\"Zombie Saga\\" part that had me thinking this was going to be horrible, but it wasn't. It takes place during the Civil War era and the when they do use up close zombie make-up it's not bad and they incorporate some animation in parts of the movie I'm sure to cut down costs on extras and scenes that would be over their budget if shot in real time on film. The acting is good but I'll only recognized a couple people in it. There are parts that seem a little too long but the movie itself was actually pretty good. Best line of the movie was said by Dee Wallace, the actress from \\"ET\\" .. \\"Trying to forget somebody you love is like trying to remember somebody you never knew.\\" It's worth a watch and if you like the Frontier meets Zombies then it should be a nice fit. If you're looking for \\"Walking Dead\\" quality zombies, it may not measure up. My advice watch and decide for yourself.
B003ELKNH2|2.0|I had seen this movie many years ago and must have forgotten it because it was wierd this time.  I wanted it because it is a classic but probably wouldn't have bought it if I had remembered it.

B001X0ZKM4|5.0|Batman Returns uhhh... returns Batman to the roots of the first movie, and<br />it really pays off for fans and movie goers alike!<br />What I liked was:<br />1. Micheal Keaton returned his powerful acting skills to the<br />well loved character; Batman!<br />2. Michelle Phiffer was excellent as Catwoman!<br />3. Danny DeVito played the Penguin with a gross yet powerful<br />talent!<br />4. The Batmobile had was cool new weapons!<br />5. The plot was, again, well put together!<br />6. Christopher Walken and his character<br /> was an interesting edition to the Batman universe!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. They could have focused on Batman a little more than they did!<br />A little more!<br /><br />Overall; this was another excellent Tim Burton/ Batman movie!<br />Another extremely recommend movie! My grade: A or five stars!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it met every expectation I had with this type of flick. Blu-ray was a great buy when i got it as well!
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Released in 1989, this movie changed the style and attitude of Batman, forever!<br />What I liked was:<br />1. Jack Nicholson nailed it and stole the movie as the Joker!<br />2. Micheal Keaton was an excellent Batman! Dark and Brooding!<br />3. Tim Burton gave the movie the look and feel it needed!<br />4. The plot was well put together!<br />5. The ten songs from 'Prince' were priceless!<br />6. The action was great!<br /><br />What I didn't like was:<br />1. Kim Basinger's constant screaming got on my nerves after a while! Ugghh!<br /><br />This movie was excellent! I loved it! Like I said earlier in my review;<br />This is the movie that changed Batman forever! Extremely recommended!<br />My grade: A or five stars!

B0063IH60K|5.0|It's solitaire the way it used to be, it's fun and it's easy and it's not so technical as some of the stuff is gotten sometimes you just need to get back to what was, and forget all about the bells and whistles because, frankly, since they're adding Ollie bells and whistles. I'm having more computer problems than ever before, so I'm trying to figure out how making them more complicated is helping anyway, that's my problem

B009E9R2OK|1.0|All I wanted was the concert on Blu-Ray. The VIDEO of the concert. It seems that this has been packed in myriad ways but you can't just get the blue ray without a bunch of extra CDs etc. I didn't notice that was audio only ( who on earth wants an audio only blu-ray?, it doesn't make sense to me!). The concert is fantastic, the delivery in this format horrible. Buyer beware.

B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Slow and acting was boring. Script bounced around and it emphasized more of politics (no surprise) than history of the events.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This is possibly the best of the Robert Langdon series. Knowing that for the first time the story is literally in our nation's heartland makes it special. Learning about the hidden symbols of our forefathers that we in modern day over look is fascinating.<br />Not only was the book thrilling from start to finish, the twists make it unputdownable. I also enjoyed the fact that there wasn't a hidden love story in the excitement. Dan Brown you've done it again! I can't wait for May 15.

0449012751|4.0|The habit of day-to-day life is just that - a habit - but we don't always recognize the toll of a habitual life.  It requires a change of perspective to see our lives for what they are.  This book is about a change of perspective - a change of about 600 miles done one step at a time.<br /><br />Harold Fry receives a letter from Queenie Hennessy and decides to mail a reply.  But a funny thing happens on the way to the post box, and he decides to deliver the letter to Queenie in person.  With only a light jacket and wearing yachting shoes, Harold sets out on the journey from Kingsbridge in the south of England to Berwick-upon-Tweed which lies just south of the border to Scotland.<br /><br />As with all quests, Harold meets characters that help him probe the past for what was and what could be.  In this, the book is much like Ron McLarty's [[ASIN:0143036688 The Memory of Running]] and Harold, like Smithy, have to work through the events of the past to make sense of the present.  The beginning of their treks, Smithy's across the U.S. on a bicycle and Harold's up the length of England on foot, are similar as well, including the aches, pains and blisters of prolonged physical activity, the recommendations and help by those who listen to their stories, and the help provided by strangers who take them into their lives and homes.<br /><br />Both characters have drawn away from others over time and during the journey their protective shells start to melt. Quoting the text is difficult when I listen instead of read, but at one time Harold says that he was beginning to care for people other than just his wife.  (If someone knows the specific quote, please let me know.)  Again a common device for a quest novel.<br /><br />What is it about us that craves new things and not the same old story?  If this book is so much like \\"Memory of Running\\" published eight years earlier, what is new about it that made the listen so enjoyable?  Smithy in \\"Memory\\" lives an extraordinary life filled with dysfunction and damaged characters.  This is clear from the beginning.  Harold seems to be heading into a typical middle-class retirement including a wife, a child and a house.  Most of us might not be able to connect with Smithy, obese, morose and the brother of a mentally disturbed sister, but we can see ourselves easily falling into the mundane life of Harold Fry.  And do we also have skeletons in our closets like he does?  Should we step away from our lives to get a better view?  Would it take 600+ miles of stepping away from our life like it did Harold?

B005V20JKI|5.0|This is such a fun game. For being free it gets an extra thumbs up. So let's get done to the controls. They are very little but even with my huge fingers it worked just fine. The characters being switched via the collectable muffins is a good way to keep you from getting used to just one characters. The level system is good for those who want to go to the next level that way. The character  upgrades ate available for leveling up and you'll want to make sure you do use them because they do make the difference between life and death. The characters them selves are also very different from one another which is definitely a upside unless you don't want a challenge. Overall rating for the game is a 9.2/10. With the great amount of characters and levels this is a great game. Although be forewarned don't buy this wanting a super challenge or you'll probably be little let down. But even whether you're a hardcore or casual gamer you'll have fun with this game.  P.S. you really don't need any permissions...nor does this need much of any data.

Whatever you call it, the edge of your seat will definitely be a little worse for the wear as the hero and heroine follow different paths of survival that ultimately bring them to the brink of mutual self destruction to avoid letting those in power win another manipulated game of epic Roman Gladiator lore. In the end, when our heros returns home, the question, &#34;Who will be chosen?&#34;, takes on a whole new meaning. But that is another story.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|The title says it all!  I saw this in the theater and just had to have it.  The movie is so powerful - it will touch all of your senses.  My friends who the play say that the movie adds so much more that could never be accommodated on stage.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Like all game choices to choose from. Frustrating but makes you determined to beat the stupid Birds!!  Great pasttime user....
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|There's enough historical accuracy to allowed one to watch this compelling adventure guiltless. Becasue watch it I will. The characters are passionate, beautiful, duplicitous and honorable at the same time. The Vikings are shown to be simultaneously ruthless and tenderhearted. There is violence as there probably was; but fortunately it is not gratuitous (I still have to look away at times though). However, beware the be presented with a meaty adventure story that is not about the Romans.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was honestly the best book of the whole series. I have read all of the books at least two times each.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Brilliant dialogue. Incredibly witty and droll. Lush, painfully beautiful sceneary. The characters are slowly but realistically developed, as are their relationships. One would expect such a highly mannered &#34;English&#34; program to be slow and boroing. If you find intelligent subtley boring, this might not be the show for you. But if you have patience with intelligent subtlety, you'll find this a gem. It's also a wonderful glimpse into an often ignored period of English history.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it's great but now i can't open it<br />I want to play more but why can't i open this game?
B000YAA68C|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I was happy to receive this video earlier then intended and It was in excellent condition. I would definitely recommend this movie and buy it from this seller.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|This is a very addicting game and really fun. It has pretty good graphics and lots of levels. The only thing that is a little disappointing is that there aren't as many levels as in the first one or the zombies mode.
0399242864|5.0|I bought this book for my two and a half year old grandson.  He loves it.  He now likes to pretend he has his own star and cups his hands together while walking around with his very own (invisible) pet star.  And then he puts it down so ever gently.  Great book.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo fast!!!! I can really keep in touch with my BFF!!!!! I will keep this for a awhile!!! Good job!!! :)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I typically love this type of sci-fi theme - set in a future where morals of the day have deviated from today (or have they?).  This movie seems to have some of the qualities of several beloved classics, like Running Man, Rollerball and others.  However, it was difficult to detect any real peaks and valleys in the story being told.  It just rolled along, fairly predictably, to the very end.  I was expecting more, based on the fanfare generated after release on the big screen.  To be fair, I plan to give it another viewing.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The horse was kind of..........scary?! Well this horse really needed help ALL THE TIME!!!!! I have a life........but If you don't you are good for this game!!! ;)
B002RVZV9K|5.0|It might get loud, is so wonderfully entertaining, smart, enlightening, nostalgic and interesting. Loved it. Will watch it over and over!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I say now I know why everyone e loves this game!! Really great graphics and challenges!! :) 200000 thumbs up for this app!!!
142312166X|4.0|I guess it was not what I expected, I thought it'd be bigger.It was very good reading as usual, though.
0316228532|4.0|Wow. Such mixed reviews! It seems everyone states whether they've read the Potter series at the top of their review, so I will state that yes, I have read the HP series and yes, I loved it. It's hard to believe this book was written by the same author. So while reading The Casual Vacancy, I forgot about that fact and I truly enjoyed it! As other reviewers have mentioned, there are a LOT of characters. But you do get to know them and I found them to be very interesting. People are funny. Some reviews said how shallow the characters were, but I found them to be just the opposite. Her characters are deep and well written. If you find the characters dull, then you will not like this book. The characters are the book. The plot seems secondary - just a framework for these characters to operate in. JK Rowling tackles a lot of serious issues in this book. I've seen other reviewers list the myriad of issues to support a negative opinion - how it was unbelievable that so many heavyweight topics were squeezed into one book. Looking at it that way, I see the point. Rowling covers death, addiction, self mutilation, rape, mental illness, poverty... geeze it sure does sound like an after school special. But honestly, I never felt that way while reading the book. I thought it was engaging and interesting story written by a very talented author. It was a pleasure to read a work of fiction by someone who can actually write when so many best sellers these days read as though they were written by teenagers.
B002NZK5QY|3.0|The picture and sound quality are very good, however, I did not like having to flip the DVD around to play the other half of the movie.  Why couldn't the whole movie be played on one side?  I found this unsual and inconvenient.
B000096FUD|4.0|In October of 2000, Terry Gilliam finally began production on his dream project, \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.\\"<br /><br />Not only was it never finished, but it barely got into production before the whole thing crashed and burned, to the point where you seriously wonder if someone put a curse on Gilliam's production. The whole high-budget madhouse is chronicled in \\"Lost in La Mancha,\\" a fascinating documentary that follows the whole trainwreck from beginning to end.<br /><br />For several years, Terry Gilliam had been seeking funding for his time-traveling, satirical movie about Don Quixote and a young ad executive from the 21st century. But because of his unique style (which doesn't really lend itself to blockbusters) and his previous flop \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,\\" investors weren't exactly lining up. But Gilliam did manage to get the funding, as well as his dream cast of Jean Rochefort as Don Quixote and a pre-pirate Johnny Depp as the ad executive.<br /><br />But... then things started going dramatically awry. It turned out that NATO had an airbase right near the set, meaning that the shoot was constantly interrupted by LOUD PLANE NOISE. Miscommunications on set. A flash flood that ruined a whole day of shooting. And while both Rochefort and Depp were troupers, the former ended up suffering debilitating health issues that left him unable to work.<br /><br />Sadly the movie never got past the first week of production, so unlike other troubled productions by Gilliam (\\"The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus,\\" anyone?) we never received an actual movie. It's a shame, since the brief moments of footage that viewers see are excellent and rather amusing -- where else do you see Johnny Depp swearing and fighting a fish?<br /><br />But at least the trainwreck was somewhat salvaged by \\"Lost in La Mancha.\\" There's almost a comedic quality to all the disasters that befell this production, and the surreality of it all is heightened by Gilliam's own direction. The giants, the Monty Pythonesque cartoons, the army of puppets -- it gives an extra layer of weirdness to a production that seemed... over-the-top. Gilliam himself couldn't have come up with a more bizarre comedy of errors if he had tried.<br /><br />It's also a fascinating study for anyone who wants to know more about filmmaking. Terry Gilliam is a visionary and artist, but he also has to juggle a thousand unromantic tasks and jobs to actually get his movies made. For just a few minutes of usable footage, we see a few HOURS of all the nitty-gritty work that went into it. And it brings home how fragile some of these movies are, where a single problem (Rochefort's health) can topple everything.<br /><br />As a final note: Terry Gilliam laughs like Tigger, and his repeated giggles will probably leave viewers wondering when he's going to announce that his top is made out of rubber and his bottom is made out of springs.<br /><br />We may never get a Gilliam movie about Don Quixote, but at least we got a decent documentary out of his stillborn film. \\"Lost in La Mancha\\" is funny, sad and sometimes just strange, just like a Gilliam movie.ants, the Monty Pythonesque cartoons, the army of puppets -- it gives an extra layer of weirdness to a production that seemed... over-the-top.

B00C6F60HE|5.0|Imagine a world where your future is determined by your genes. Your schools, your job, your social status are all determined by what genetic flaws you have.<br /><br />Such is the world that we see in \\"Gattaca,\\" a scarily plausible sci-fi story that examines the implications of eugenics and genetic enhancement. Director Andrew Niccol thankfully never gets too preachy or \\"uplifting\\" -- instead he crafts a cleanly elegant story with a murder mystery as the catalyst, and the strong trinity Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.<br /><br />Vincent Freeman (Hawke) is an \\"invalid,\\" conceived without eugenic technology. On the day he was born, it was predicted that he would be myopic, might be bipolar, and would probably die at thirty from a heart defect. Throughout his life, Vincent dreams of becoming an astronaut, but his genetic status dooms him to menial labor.<br /><br />The solution: Vincent \\"buys\\" the identity and genetic profile of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Law), an Olympic swimmer who broke his back in a car crash. Vincent will pay Jerome, and Jerome will provide him with blood, urine, skin and hair samples.<br /><br />With Jerome's help, Vincent is accepted into Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, and is chosen for a manned flight to Titan. But when one of the administrators is found murdered, the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes nearby. If they discover who Vincent truly is, he won't just lose his dream -- he'll be convicted of murder.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is a movie that addresses one of life's great questions -- does destiny determine how we live our lives, or do we decide our own fate? There are no easy answers, but it's always best to err on the side of \\"we can make our own destiny\\" -- and this movie is basically all about one man's quest to determine his own fate, DNA be damned.<br /><br />None of the movies Andrew Niccol has made since \\"Gattaca\\" have even come close to this level of skill -- the movie is a slow, elegant winding of murder mystery and philosophical sci-fi. The plot quietly grows in tension as Vincent's life becomes more tangled up in lies and suspicion, with quietly powerful dialogue laced with dry humor (\\"I guess we can rule out suicide,\\" comments a cop as they bag a bloodied keyboard).<br /><br />And it's beautifully filmed. Everything is full of clean lines and cold light, with the occasional moment of symbolism -- note that the apartment that Eugene and Vincent share is centered around a giant DNA-style spiral staircase.<br /><br />And the final puzzle pieces are the actors, who are all really good. Ethan Hawke gives a quietly powerful performance as a man who goes to desperate lengths to fulfill his dreams, and Uma Thurman has the right mix of icy reserve and sweetness as a \\"valid\\" woman who falls in love with the man rather than his DNA.<br /><br />But the best performance is Jude Law. Jerome a truly tragic character, whose genetic perfection wasn't enough to keep disaster away -- he's proof that DNA can't make your life good or rewarding. Law plays him with a mixture of bitter wit and compassion, with perpetually shadowed eyes and a drink always in his hand. You may cheer for Vincent, but your heart will bleed for Jerome.<br /><br />\\"Gattaca\\" is a masterpiece of science fiction -- a richly nuanced, beautifully understated work that reminds you that, no matter where we come from, we can all reach for the stars.ical sci-fi.

B007URCTOG|5.0|I once again fell in love with Rachel McAdams.  Unlike my falling in love with Rachele McAdams, which is just a fleeting feeling, as \\"falling in love\\" always is, this movie is a story about true love.  What impressed me most was the closing scene when Paige thanks Leo and he says he didn't do anything, she responds, \\"You did everything.  You accepted me for who I am, and not for what you wanted me to be.\\"  Then he says, \\"I just wanted you to be happy.\\"  That is true love, a love you can't fall into.  A love that can not be earned, but is freely given.  A love that is inspiring, and worthy of aspiring to.  A love that is hard to give, but impossible withhold because it is true.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It makes you think about a lot of things and I'll admit, it had me in tears at the end.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I am a music lover, but have to admit I haven't taken the time to seek out this type of music before. The vast majority of the music I listen to are popular songs by popular artists. I have often been moved by music, but always because I can relate to the lyrics. Listening to The Piano Guys is the first time I have had a powerful emotional reaction to the music alone. Ever since I discovered these amazing musicians, their music has occupied the majority of my playlists. I could fill the page with superlatives and it wouldn't begin to quantify the quality and emotion The Piano Guys put into their music.<br /><br />Be sure to check out their videos on youtube to get a better understanding of the passion they put into their music.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is a clever write, but will definitely induce tears. This book opened my eyes to the reality of what it really means to live.
145210655X|5.0|This is really clever and fun to read. The author, Jeffrey Brown, does a great job of taking common Star Wars tropes and making cute and entertaining jokes, and situation out of them.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What more is there to say?  It is a classic work of fiction. You either love it or are uninterested. I read it every year as part of the holiday celebration.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|What can I say?  This is, season two of the best show to ever his the &#34;air waves&#34;. This combo pack is fantastic, I love having both Blu-Ray and DVD in the same set for watching on my various TV sets, some without a BR player. Buy it, but be sure to get Season 1 too!
B00B7HQ1DA|5.0|Scaggs' voice is still in good form, full of soulful subtleties though it's a little craggier around the edges, and his spare guitar is still fresh and uncliched. Here he pays homage to classic songs by others that he interprets wonderfully. Among my faves are two early songs by the late punk-era soul throwback Mink Deville, &#34;Mixed Up Shook Up Girl&#34; and &#34;Cadillac Walk&#34; (DeVille's worth hearing if you don't know his work) and Brook Benton's &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia.&#34;

B003M6TVQI|5.0|I rated this 5 stars because it's simply a brilliant show. I love all the actors/characters. We are watching this for a second time, due to the plot twists that have happened over the years and minds need refreshing on all that has happened.
0300169787|5.0|I love Alexander McQueen, and I have an immense amount of respect for him and for his work. His death was a tragedy, but his creativity will never be lost (in part due to this book). This book is amazing. The photos are gorgeous and cover an amazing amount of his work, and seeing his evolution through the years is really interesting. The reference in that back is also great, because it allows you to understand what collections you like and what pieces are favorites, etc. I also would like to point out that this book is great in part because it was not built around the expectation that you saw the exhibit, but it instead just built to be a tribute to McQueen in general. Amazing product at an amazing price!
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A very sad story, but one with a happy ending.  This story expressed very graphically how flawed the care for children and young families is. Flowers were able to say what Victoria couldn't put into words. Maybe more of us need to learn the language of flowers.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is a very fun game with many exciting levels that are actually possible to pass! Usually if you get a free app they don't give you many levels, but Angry birds has a variety of scenery and challenges! This app is fun for all ages!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Well written, fast paced, and an excellent creative story line.  One of the best concepts ever put together.  Downloading his next book now.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this was the best book of the three it ended just like I had hoped it would I love happy ending
B002SSUQFG|1.0|The right size and simplicity in reading the face make this a winner for me. It was the utilitarian piece I was hoping for.    Update:  I had to send it in for repair January 2014 because it would no longer wind itself and keep time.  Received it back March 2014, wore it and it quit keeping time again September 2014.  Was very disappointed in the durability of this watch for the casual use it was asked to do.  It is not worth the hassle to have warranty repair again. I will trash it and find another brand to wear for an everyday watch.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning to end lots of things that really happen every day in peoples lives
B004F1F32A|5.0|Great movie. Liuam Neeson is an amazing actor and is well suited to this movie. I'd recommend this to others.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|this product did not work on my Kindle. I'm not sure what to use for the Kindle. Need more assistance in using this product.
030758836X|3.0|I'd heard that Gone Girl was a page turner and that's what I wanted.  I had a two hour flight from one bad weather city to another, so I figured four hours in the air plus the possibility of a delay means I need a book to entertain me.  I wasn't looking for high literature, just a book to enjoy and then pass on to someone else when I'm done.<br /><br />While I admit that Gone Girl was certainly a better book than I could have written, it's not up to the rave reviews it has received.  But I couldn't put the damn thing down.  At least four times, I said \\"screw it\\" and closed the book, but I kept going back to it.  That could be the charm of it.  Every character is so obnoxious, you want everyone to get their comeuppance.  It's definitely entertaining, a good book to kill time with on an airplane and that is its redeeming feature.  The author had a good idea, but fell a bit short of pulling it off.<br /><br />There are a lot of clichés in the book and a few lines where you know people just don't talk like that.  There were a few times when someone would do something stupid and you knew it was the author's way of moving the story along.  Like many other reviewers, I thought the ending was awful.  If you are going to read this book, I recommend you stop fifty pages before the end and try to come up with an ending yourself, then finish the book.  I guarantee you won't guess it and that your ending will be better, but that might be why so many people loved the book.
B00AYBU7TE|5.0|I have to say, until this album I was not a big Johnny Cash fan, but this is a fantastic album. Mostly covers, but he changes them, and truly makes them his own.
B00BWGL6BS|5.0|Best of the British Isles.Can't abide by too many of them, but she's def in the Top Five!!  Kudos on such a brilliant release, as I expected from you.We LOVE you here in the NYC area.  When you gonna come see us?
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This game is so fun.  The birds each have their own unique ability.  There is some strategy involved.  You have to think about the trajectory of the birds, how the gravity (the pulses of the gravity) effects their fall, but mostly it is just fun to pop the pigs or give them black eyes.  Some levels are just fun and others are really challenging.  It's a good game for anyone.  I recommend this game to everyone.
B0094WK9EC|3.0|Yeah, it's a decent effort by SHM, but not GREAT, some repetitiveness that gets annoying, but all in all a good record.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This is a man who's voice and life story will inspire you, and I think that's the only thing he ever wanted.  I'm glad it's finally happening.<br />This is a TRUE story that's better than anything Hollywood could have come up with.<br />The subject of this film is heroic - not only for his music, but also for his spirit and selflessness.  And speaking of his music... both albums are timeless.  Buy them, right now.<br /><br />Oh yeah...  and he's a Detroiter.
B002JODUI4|5.0|All DeadMau5 has to is hint at a new release, and I'm all over it.  Have become huge fan over last year.

B009GESJH2|5.0|I enjoyed this CD very much.  I would recommend this CD.  I have them all.  Each one has a different feel.  That's the point.  Feel it!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|&#34;Nuff said&#34;<br />There isn't anything bad to say about this movie unless you really dislike Marvel.  This covers all the avengers fairly equal but makes you want to see more!<br /><br />This combo pack is great (Blu-ray, 3D, DVD and Digital Copy)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is so great almost my school has this game.if I was you I would get it. it is free why not

B003ZDZ1WG|4.0|Heard them on an airplane ride and decided to check out their entire new album.  Liked what I've heard so far
B003CW67TQ|5.0|So I read it quickly. It scared me, which I do not normally like. It fascinated me, which I do love a lot. The plot has many twists and changes and leaves you looking for the next chapter. Hard on your sleeping patterns but then again that's what the author is trying to achieve - no? I really loved the intensity of the story.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie. Interesting concept and am looking forward to reading the books. Was a hater but but now im in- cant wait for whats next!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|After a four year hiatus Fall Out Boy returns with their fifth studio 'Save Rock & Roll'. Which after the lackluster fourth album returns them to glory that was 'From Under the Cork Tree' and 'Infinity on High' their second and third albums respectively. The album does open weakly with \\"The Phoenix\\" but it's quickly pick up momentum during the second track and keeps your interest for the reminder of the album. The album features a fine collection of pop-rock songs and also a few guest spots by Big Sean, Elton John, Courtney Love, & Foxes. Easily the best track on here is the lead single \\"MySongs Know What You Did in the Dark (Light Em Up)\\".
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|I loved it the Blu-Ray picture and surround sound are fantastic!!!! Ha all the songs I grew up with listening to!
B000001F9N|5.0|Donna Summer returns with her third album &#34;A Love Trilogy&#34; which was released in 1976. The album which is nice mix of R&B and disco, opens up the 18 minute long disco groove &#34;Try Me, I Know We Can Make It&#34; which had occupied side A of the vinyl the release. &#34;Try Me..&#34; which is a nice laidback slow R&B groove with elements of disco. Side B open with the interlude &#34;Prelude to Love&#34; which is then followed by the Barry Manilow cover &#34;Could it Be Magic&#34; which is one of the highlights of the album. The then concludes &#34;Wasted&#34; and &#34;Come With Me&#34; the former also serving as the b-side to the second singe &#34;Try Me&#34;.

B009UMTMKS|4.0|Good reference.<br />The book contains practical considerations for converting ideas into results. Very interesting for startups as well as companies operating.
1400067820|2.0|The idea that over-designing and over-building may produce an unwarranted sense of security is a valuable one.  Likewise, that the encouragement of more randomness, and the tolerance of modest defects, may result, overall, in greater stability is also insightful.  The remarkable part of this book is it's metaphorical element.  It is a monument to randomness, constructed with only the most rudimentarily basic design.  It is substantially a poorly written, disconnected, bunch of thoughts, jotted down (it seems) at random times in airport lounges, or just emerging from the shower.  That makes it a paean to randomness, but it is impossible to read, to follow, and, without a great deal of extrapolation and reintegration, to ingest.  Hat's off to someone so renowned that he can produce this amalgam of the trivial and the obscure and make a bundle off it, but I'm afraid I'm feeling hosed.
1401937268|5.0|The cards are lovely, so well decorated and amazingly correct! An everyday angel help - easy to use although the pack seems a bit to bulgy sometimes.

B0052UZIFA|5.0|I love this game! I know a lot of people who are addicted =P. 5 Stars because it hasn't gotten annoying yet and I've beat it many times.
B002ZG9846|5.0|This movie is incredible. It's full of scenes that have you shaking your head in wonder and disbelief. Great twist on superheros that keeps you on your toes and fully entertained. It's not for the light of heart, but is definitely worth it.

B00APKIN1I|5.0|Being a big Foo fan, I was really excited about this release. Love all the songs. Congrats to Dave and the guys.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This may just be the greatest bond ever! Not only does Daniel Craig portray the character of James Bond in the way of Ian Fleming's literary vision, but Javier Bardem is the perfect villian... the perfect Bond villian. Even though the movie may have come up short as far as Bond Ladies are concerned, the gripping plot and outstanding acting are far too engrossing to worry about the ladies... Skyfall is what these past 50 years have been building up to:)
B008220D5K|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time, obviously trying to capitalize on the success of knocked up. Save you money, but more importantly save your time and avoid this trash. Should be able to give it zero star rating.

I generally eschew most things the mainstream radio throws at me.<br /><br />I've always been able to acknowledge when someone has talent, and JT always has. He wasn't my cup of tea, I wasn't going to go buy his albums, but I could give credit where it was due. So, it was a big surprise to me when not only did I like a couple of Timberlake's new songs, I actually *considered* buying the album... then I heard a little more... and then I pre-ordered it.<br /><br />This isn't pop. The majority of the songs clock in at over 5 minutes, most even at the 6-7 minute range. Pop songs are not 7 minute forays. He's taken his soul chops to a new level and outdone a lot of other folks in the R&B realm these days. Hell, he's done a better album than most soul/R&B folks have done in the past 15-20 years. It's modern music, for sure, both rhythmically and melodically, although I can't help but draw parallels to 70's soul (Marvin Gaye especially) with a little hint of late-50's/early-60's Motown to pepper it up. I play several stringed instruments, so I appreciate musically thoughtful effort. Some of the songs diverge from a solid jam and head toward more ethereal places, but without really becoming pretentious or self-indulgent. Hearing the layers of instrumentation, with heavy tips-of-the-hat to some influential masters, blended with something sparklingly modern and original, has had me listening repeatedly and continuously finding nuances I hadn't noticed and appreciate more and more.<br /><br />Bottom line, this album has found its way into heavy rotation in my stereo at home and in my car. I will just as likely put ,this in my CD changer as I would Three Mile Pilot or The Weepies. You might be as surprised as I was to find yourself a Justin Timberlake fan before the disc is through.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The processor was exactly as expected. I did replace the fan that comes with it, but that's because I was building a gaming/video editing rig and didn't think the intel fan would be enough under heavy load. There's really not much else to say about the product.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I vote zombie mode for the future patch.  Basically it's farmville but it has dinosaurs... what more do you nee.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|As good as, if not better in some ways, than the PC version.  Pretty easy tapping the tablet to drop your plants into place.  It's pretty CPU-intensive, but who cares?  :-)
B000FCKC4C|3.0|I thought this book was going to be a bit more complex than it actually was, but after reading it I discovered that in its simplicity it managed to send a very profound message to the reader. It is a very fast read, and you might learn something about yourself if you choose to read it.
B0012QVJXS|1.0|When i was young I probably watched this movie but I don't remember it. Probably because it wasn't any good. It's a shame because it had the potential to be better. The very first six to seven minute scene in the movie makes no sense at all, it has no relevence to the story. If there is relevence it's left out of the movie which is just as bad. Three bad guys on trial, then the destruction of planet krypton, poor writing. I like how the movie starts in Krypton and they're talking about the destruction of the planet and their send off of Superman. After the man and woman find baby superman it goes sixteen years in time for one scene when his father dies. The scene seems planned and unnatural. We know nothing about his father. Then he finds the Kryptonite which doesn't hurt him, goes to alaska throws it in the water and it creates some type of palace. The end of the movie when Superman spins around the earth and magically the bomb doesn't go off. Why would circling the earth do this. Also the original authors got screwed out of any proceeds for this film which is wrong. Just another case of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer.<br />The special effects were good, but it doesn't mean jack to me if the story's bad. I admit that I haven't read the comic, so maybe if I did i'd understand it better. But i shouldn't have to read the comic to enjoy the movie.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I got this as a gift to supplement my DVD copies. I will watch the lower resolution any day of the week over these. Han shot first. Jabba wasn't in episode iv... I only watch the original theatrical versions and am a purist. I sold this on ebay and got a copy of bladerunner instead.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Sanderson gives us a whole new world to explore, light and dark. Cannot wait until the next one is published!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I ran across this series quite by accident, looking at reviews online.  Although I've enjoyed a few sci-fi books in my time, I can't claim to be a &#34;sci-fi&#34; fan.  I did, however, really enjoy this series.  Being honest, a big appeal was the price: if this cost more, I probably would have never bought it.<br /><br />A very compelling story that had me turning the pages non-stop.  Is it the best written book I've ever read? No.  But thoroughly enjoyable and presenting some really interesting questions about society.  And I will say this:  I had no idea where this book was going until the very end.  I highly recommend if you have some interest in sci-fi but get turned away by the hardcore stuff.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I am not, by my nature, a very emotional man.<br /><br />I laughed, pounding the table next to me.<br /><br />I openly wept when the story turned dark.<br /><br />Rothfus writes masterfully.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|I've followed Robin Sloan online for awhile, both on Snarkmarket and his other writing in various places.  This book reads as if Mr. Sloan took all of the wonderful things happening in the world today that he shares online and encapsulated them into a &#34;fiction&#34; novel.  This wasn't the best-written book I've read all year, and you can tell that Mr. Sloan is not a career fiction writer.  But I could care less because this book is just so much fun to read!  If you are the type of person that is equally fascinated with history and the modern world, and all the exquisite intersections and collisions that happen in real life, you'll really enjoy this novel.  I hope he continues to write novels!
0345536886|5.0|I have never been disappointed with a John Grisham book and this one was most enjoyable.  Another book about lawyers, this time a small chicago firm is battling a deep-pockets Goliath firm.  The book is very entertaining and fast paced.  Every page is delightful.  Interesting character studies.  Wonderful plot developments.  Sorry that the book had to end but it was a great read.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|For a book that reads fairly academically, this book hit me hard.  I can't claim to have a huge knowledge of WWII beyond the basics and the pop culture movies.  This book, however, completely erased by American-centric view of the war.  A completely comprehensive telling of the war from all sides, with the perfect touches of humanizing stories mixed in with the largely tactical recounting of every front and aspect of the war.  I can already tell that this is one of those books that, if absorbed, will change my understanding of the world and where we are today.  A must read for anyone with even a mild interest in history, or even an understanding of how we got to where we are today.  I truly cherished every page of this book, even when it made me stop and catch my breath to try and comprehend the complete and utter destruction that accompanied this so-called &#34;good war.&#34;
0446605409|3.0|Just as the author of Plum Island, Nelson DeMille, can be intrigued by the setting of this novel, so too can the reader.  Most New Yorkers have been to Long Island at one time or another, but few can say they have been to the islands on the shores of the East End of Long Island.  These secretive islands with nondescript names such as Gardiners Island and Robin's Island have history, myth, and intrigue associated with them.<br /><br />In the new forward to the book, DeMille wrote that readers enjoyed Detective John Corey because he flaunted the conventions in a time of political correctness.  The success of the television show `The Office' used a similar formula to great acclaim.  The difference, for this reader / viewer, was that Steve Carell knew his character was a dork, and he played that angle to great comical effect.<br /><br />The reader of `Plum Island' can still cheer for John Corey to catch the bad guys, because they are so evil that you want them to get caught, even if John Corey bags them.  One does lose sympathy for idiots in their powerboats during a hurricane, particularly after the trouble that we had with Sandy last October in the New York area.<br /><br />Plum Island does not make the best use of integrating the history of the islands of the Eastern End into the story.  Compare what DeMille wrote to this excerpt from Bruce Lambert in the New York Times:  \\"Captain Kidd buried pirate treasure there. One Island woman was tried for witchcraft decades before Salem's trials. Another was so beautiful that she dazzled Washington society, married the President and inadvertently saved his life. And during the cold war, one island was used for secret research for a germ warfare attack on the Soviet Union.\\"<br /><br />The ingénue who hooked a President was the lovely Julia Gardiner, a descendant of the family that owned Gardiner's Island.  John Tyler became the first president to get married while in office.  The only other President to marry in office was Grover Cleveland, who also married a girl young enough to be his daughter.<br /><br />When Corey stumbled upon the possibility that the Gordons were killed looking for the secret buried treasure of Captain Kidd, a new and interesting dimension was added to the story.  The North Fork murder / mystery with a sidebar on 'Anthrax Island' was opened up to the other mysterious islands of the East End.  Places such as Fisher's Island, Cartwright Island, Great Gull Island, and Little Gull Island were all possible destinations for Captain Kidd's Treasure.  Even the Block Island, which is part of the state of Rhode Island, is easily accessible for East Enders with a boat.<br /><br />The nickname of Anthrax Island for Plum Island goes back to the movie `The Silence of the Lambs.'  Agent Clarice Starling offers Hannibal Lecter a `vacation' on Plum Island as part of a prison relocation package for information leading to the capture of the kidnapper of Senator Martin's daughter.  Lecter was the one to call it `Anthrax Island.'<br /><br />Someone gave me Plum Island about two years ago, and I finally got around to reading the novel.  Maybe in two years I'll read another book by Nelson DeMille.
0143039431|5.0|Grapes of Wrath is a story for today.  Steinbeck makes the characters real and although I learned from the chapters full or comments on the times, I was anxious to get back to the story!  Our community theater in Asheville performed this play.

B0053TMP24|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a while. My favorite character not counting Percy it has to b out be Frank
0553801473|1.0|I would review this book if I could get my hands on a paperback edition.  I am waiting for it to come out in paperback so I can read the book.  The hardback is too heavy for me to carry around with me.  It's been 2 years, what's the hold up?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Excellent use of language, heart wrenching but uplifting as well. Recommended reading for anyone who appreciates good writing and story for it tells and the reader feels.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Loved it!  Castle is always entertaining and fresh.  Would recommend the entire series.  Just hope Castle never gets shot because I don't think he could handle that!!  Still love the character though.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I love this series, Tom Selleck does a great job and they are intriguing but predictable, and he is smart.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This story captured me from the beginning, held me every page throughout, and has not released me even though it is ended. I'm excited to get the next book to continue the story of Kvothe. Perfect formula of interesting plots, characters, description and pace.

014028009X|5.0|This book is so funny, I was bent over double and laughing out loud.  It has a place on my bookshelf.
0385349947|4.0|As a professional woman who has had to work very hard in my career I appreciate the viewpoint and advice Sheryl brings to women.  Even if you don't aspire to being a CEO or CFO of a large corporation, this book can help you see your role differently in not only your own career but in understanding and supporting others in theirs.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This is a great resource to start with if you're thinking about writing a book for Kindle.  It's really all about the actual formatting of your book, which is better to get right from the beginning rather than going back and trying to fix it in the end.  The Kindle Direct Publishing page has some great information about the actual steps for self-publishing on Amazon, but this book will give you the details on formatting that you'll need to know in actually writing the book in Word.  It's summarized well and easy to follow.  Short and sweet works well for this and hopefully you'll feel like you're on the right track with writing your book after reading through this resource.
B00AG6Z92C|3.0|Somewhat of a disappointment. Boccelli's voice is always beautiful, but this doesn't have the soul stirring quality of &#34;Romanzo&#34; for instance. Some songs were more suited to his style than others. His rendition of &#34;Roma Non Fa La Stupida Stasera&#34; lacked the gutsiness and grit for which this love song to Rome is so justifiably famous. Ironically, his Spanish language songs came off better.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved everything about it except the end of the last episode.  so sad!  The relationships of the characters on Downton Abbey are interesting on so many levels.  I love a show with a lot of substance and this one fits the bill!  the whole series is the best I've seen in a long while.
B0024FADDI|5.0|very good movie if you are into scary and funny at the same time any one can enjoy this movie
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Product arrived as descried.  it's  versatile and portable.  I could carrying it in my pocket and it's light weight.  I like it!
B007URVZJ6|2.0|I was having lots of formating issues when trying to create articles and books for Kindle.  Admittedly, I'm somewhat out of the main stream, because I choose to use the open source OS, Linux; the open source word processor, Libre Office; and the open source eBook manager, Calibre.<br /><br />It turned out for me that meticulously following the instructions in this book was not only a complete waste of time, but a total disaster.  The final results were the worst ever, being so far from WYSIWIG that I would have to declare that this alleged system of first creating a document with a word processor with very specific paragraphing commands, saving to HTML, and then converting a second time to a proprietary Amazon format verging on complete insanity.<br /><br />In the end I learned by chance that you can submit to the Amazon KDP website text that you have converted with Calibre directly in the .mobi format.<br /><br />My suggestion is that Amazon work with the Open Source Community to make direct publishing to Kindle format from Libre Office a viable reality.  I suppose this book is some benefit to those locked into the Microsoft world, but it's a total failure when it comes to good effective advice when using open source tools.<br /><br />In my opinion direct conversion through Calibre is the way to go inasmuch as KDP accepts documents converted directly into .mobi with Calibre.  Better yet would be Amazon providing financial support to the Open Source Development Community so that people could save directly to .mobi from Libre Office, and Open Office without all of the frustration of conversion using secondary software tools.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Very moving story, that was very interesting.  His walking through England to see a friend and all his past coming out was a unique way to tell the story.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|That pretty much says it all. Already read Gone Girl (liked it) and just started Dark Places.  Really enjoy the author's writing I
B000FCKC4C|4.0|Those not seeking their Personal Legend will have little understanding of Paulo Coelho's poignant message. If  you can understand The Language of the World, then the simple truths of this book will hit your core and ring true. If not, the story becomes contrived and simplistic. This book is a true test of our Epic journey through life. Will we see our own omens reflected in the sun, or whispered on the wind? Very moving and an enjoyable read.
B005ES12H8|5.0|She never leaves home without them. People ask her all the time where she got them. great for everyday use

B004I2K4DY|5.0|It was everything I expected and more. I watch it regularly.......I am so glad I purchased the CD. It is pure joy.
0812550706|2.0|Poorly developed characters, lack of style, and a threadbare story make this book a tedious read. If you start it and find it boring after a few chapters, go straight to the penultimate chapter to discover the bulk of the book's ideas.<br /><br />I read it not long after Robert Louis Stevenson's Jekyll and Hide, and this little sci-fi book pales in comparison to the masterful short story.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|fantastic! no clichés, just life itself: crude to its roots.<br />Characters carry a complexity the first book didn't.<br />You never figure out what's coming next.
B004AUGJS8|3.0|I'm giving this movie 3 stars mostly because Gosling carried it on his shoulders; it could have been much better directed and honestly, I wasn't moved by the plot. Not the worst I've seen, but I wouldn't watch it again.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its a SURE IS a fun game. Its super fun you should buy it because its fun. its a really fun game. Hi Mama, how ya doin? I don't want you to go away, Ma. I'm gonna miss you. But Mama are you gonna get mad because I did this again? Because I can delete it. I hope.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|First, I thoroughly enjoy the talents of Tina Fey. However, I avoided purchasing her book, because... well, I don't buy books written by &#34;stars&#34;, as they are typically uninterestingly self-aggrandizing. However, I took the plunge with this book, as I was looking for some light reading for a coast-to-coast flight. It turns out that I felt as though I was actually talking with Tina Fey and she was her &#34;on stage funny self.&#34; I have recommended the book to a number of people, because it is an excellent, and very funny read. I am now excitedly awaiting her next book.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I had been waiting on the movie to come out but decided to read the book first. Enjoyed it, read it in two days.
B003DS3GC0|3.0|It's OK - started pretty good but the idea of a priest lying ruined the picture! Lack of imagination from the writers
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love love this game... Can play for hours. Plays well on my Kindle fire. I have always enjoyed Buffalo Studios games.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I especially like it when we are traveling and have access to radar for the area.  It is very helpful because you do not always know the county name for which you are traveling through.
B00824ZJ84|5.0|Someone at work told me about this artist. When I heard the whole album I feel in love with her voice.  She is so soulful. It kind of reminds me of Adelle and Anita Baker mixture.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a wonderful story, and beautifully written as well.  The characters are well defined, and each one is poignant, inspiring, and totally believable, a feat not often found in todays best sellers.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a very special reading experience.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|I was sooooo glad when I figured out I could sync my music on the kindle fire with my android phone. This app works perfectly good and I have been enjoying music ever since.
B004V9MU86|5.0|Tugged at my heart the whole way through. Sad but uplifting as well. Definitely recommend it. What else can I say?
0062124293|5.0|I enjoyed reading this from start to finish.  It made me realize that although I will probably screw up my daughter in some way, that women are pretty resilient if we keep our view about it on the lighter side. Her British humor was hysterical!
B009VA1FN6|4.0|Kept me guessing till the end. A little long perhaps, too much rumination, but overall very entertaining. I'll read more from Kate Morton
B0089PJFFY|4.0|There was a lot of drama in her young life. Some of her own making. That is how teenage girls are.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|My husband was watching friends reruns on tv and having to wait through commercials and viewing episodes out of order. I bought this package for him and he was genuinely thrilled to have it. The episodes are still just as funny to watch as they were ten years ago.  I would recommend this for any couch potato who enjoys the Friends series. My husband has told me a dozen times how much he is enjoying watching the shows.  It was worth the splurge
B00B2V66VS|5.0|its totally awesome my 3 and 5 year olds can play it no problem and it keeps them busy for hours
030758836X|3.0|I read this book at the advice of a friend. The author spent a lot of time thinking about these events and laying a good story line making this book an entertaining read. Some things in this book were flag out ridiculous and impossible. I was disappointed with the finality of the book as I Sun  envisioned a different outcome.
006114665X|3.0|A good book on the origins of World War I  --  but not light reading.<br />Written by a historian for historians.<br />A serious scholarly work on the subject,<br />not for the casual reader.<br /><br />The author is a historian at Cambridge Univ. UK and<br />is well known for this work on European history.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|It lives up to my standards.  I have liked it quicker than any other deftones album.  Buy this album don't burn it.  It's worth it.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I just simply love these books and would recommend to anyone that is looking to keep their interest in a well written book
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This is an awesome game. It is worth their money and is a challenge. ( partially because this is my first temple run game.) It matches the movie closely and has two places from the movie. There are no glitches thus far.. but this is a time sucking game so watch out!
B004SDSSFY|2.0|I can't remember why I bought it for my tablet in the first place, and I haven't been able to imagine any use for it.

B00AWBNNAG|5.0|Awesome seriously the best! It lists the pieces and assembly step by step! And i cant believe it's free! I love this app! The only bad thing is you have to know the exact name of item, but not a big deal. Excellent app! Great job!
B00BJA2VFW|3.0|I'm sure that the game may be quite enchanting, but to middle-aged eyes, too many of the icons are too similar in color.  I love the logic of the swapping game play, but honestly, after only three screens, there didn't seem to be much variation which only made me frustrated.  Probably great for the younger generation who will see this as a challenge!  :)
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|But my husband is a Trekkie and he loves that it was just Captain Kirk. He still hasn't decided if he will leave them unopened or watch them.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I enjoyed the book so much! Following &#34;Katie&#34; on her journey and finding the life she deserved. The more I read, the harder it was to put it down!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|The reason I gave the game 4 stars insted of 5 is because they give you limeted diamonds and since I'm a kid I cant pay real money for them and they give you about 8 to start off but then they make you use all of them
B004ZP37ZQ|5.0|Season 6 is not viewed as great by many fans but outside the plot holes and little things that don't make sense the actors hold their own well and the ongoing story overall is great until the final episode which is somewhat a waste. This episode begins to show that Cas has quite a bit he is not sharing with Sam and Dean and Bobby suspects all may not be right.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|The case has turned out to counterfeit.  Regestered for extended warrent life told us was not their case so this stinks!!!!!
B001TDJYWC|5.0|Though the box on the dvd is not original at all the dark movie is still great almost 30 years later. Good character development at the Brown farm and Brad's friend Charlie starts his four part journey here. Billy Zane bites it in the barn which is great and the two bounty hunters 'Ug' and 'Lee' have a smaller role in this one than in the sequel which raised the stakes. It is a very enjoyable horror/sci-fi low budget movie except for the 3 minutes of super low budget in space near the beginning. Wish someone would do a good new movie or reboot with a story - Critters are excellent.
B001F12J0C|3.0|I love the Bourne trilogy but was disappointed when at the end of the first disc the dvd went screwy,  but didn't feel like going through the hassle of sending whole thing back.
B007ZTLLMK|2.0|Downloaded this on an incompatible phone so that was less than awesome but it looked pretty cool until it crashed over and over
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Best game in the Kindle amazinggameplay quality every thing its the same as th&eacute; real game juste awsome as hell
B008ASGP3U|3.0|I became kind of bored with this book as the characters kept traveling up and down the same highway accomplishing not much of anything.  Finally, at the end of the book, everything became more interesting.
B00ATPVA78|3.0|Not sure if the kidos would like it..most kids can sit that long. But you can try to included them in most of your games.

B009HOU672|5.0|I listen to the piece all the time so much so that I have to be careful not to overplay it when I’m teaching my ballet classes. I heard some of Richter’s Four Seasons on the radio as part of an interview with the composer.  He said he had always loved Vivaldi’s Four Seasons but he had heard it so many times in his life that the piece was becoming hard to enjoy.  He went on to say he wanted to restore his love of the piece and feels by recomposing Vivaldi it was sort of “an act of love toward this fantastic masterpiece.”  I was very interesting in hearing the whole piece since I had had the same experience with the music, hearing it and dancing the ballet over the years.  I didn’t buy the CD right away but the music kept creeping back into my mind until I had to order it.  Richter’s version is fascinating and hauntingly beautiful without losing the original exquisiteness of Vivaldi’s music. I have discussed Richter’s Four Seasons with my students and they not only love dancing to it but are now also interested in listening to Vivaldi’s original work.  Richter made the Four Season come alive again and it makes me listen to the original in a fresh way.
B008NEVPCC|5.0|Love this cd its my favorite. All these songs were really good and catchy . I want all her cds now lol
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I needed a simple notepad app - this does what I need. Easy to use. It is a good little notepad app.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|There's no doubt that Cameron is the king of 3D and, having had a near-drowning experience while rafting in W VA, I can tell you that this movie had me holding my breath and very nervous on several occasions. The 3D makes you feel like you are one of the swimmers on the journey, desperately looking and praying for a solution to the dilemma before you. Worth the watch in 3D for sure!
B0064MGU98|4.0|This show is like All My Children, 24 and Law and Order all wrapped up into one. The protagonist is annoying and impossible to empathize with and her love interest is impossible to view as a heartthrob but all of this shows' weaknesses are its biggest strengths.
B0073U2F12|4.0|Although this is definitely a B movie, it really is done quite well. Like most Bs, you have to overlook some things; but the overall concept and effect is suspenseful and worth the view. The 3D is done very well for a relatively low-budget sci-fi flick, which is the reason I bought this BRD. For the price, it's a good watch and one that I will pull off the shelf every now and then.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I got it mostly because my grandkids are always wanting to play on grandma's phone, I have played but I am nowhere as good as they r
B0017OB12O|5.0|This classic from my childhood (b. 1956) is about the character of people more than anything else. Character of the type portrayed in this movie is far more difficult to find in today's culture, whether American, European, Asian, or African. The story remains intriguing, but it is the people and how they approach their roles, duties, and responsibilities that make this flick a fascinating study of human nature — especially given the amount of social change from 1957 to today.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Very easy but wish there was a percent sign I do a lot of sales tax at work, just a little shop, but I like the program go for on the go
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|Yes, I know that there is a lot of bloviating over this classic, but it simply is a must-see movie for anyone. There are clearly a lot of Kane characters in every historic period. Welles had the audacity to take one in his day to task. To really understand the history of this movie, pair watching it with RKO 281 then watch Citizen again; then you'll understand what's below the surface.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have read everyone one of his books I acually read this one twice, didn't know I read it already but it was good to read agin before I went to the movies which I haven't done yet. Very exciting
B001794FOK|5.0|I've had this BRD for some time and finally getting around to a review. The concept of this thriller is intriguing and the cinematography is done well. The jumps to iconic locations provides a fast-paced world tour to help bring off the story line. After all, what would you do if you could Jump? I also find the acting to be well done in this sci-fi thriller, which I have watched repeated times. It's a flick that I wish had been filmed in 3D; I'd even be interested in buying a 3D rerelease of this movie. Even for those of you who are interested but considering the cost, pick up a used copy for pennies and enjoy the results of this fast-paced thriller.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I have trouble playing this on my Kindle Fire, my little guy won't go where I want him to half the time and the ghosts move quicker than he does. I used to be a Pac-Man expert with other computers and at the arcade, Without a joystick I'm pitiful! On this I can just barely get to the second level before the game is over :(
B004NELBPC|2.0|This app is now horrible. The large pictures are not necessary. The font is too small on some articles. It is no longer easy to read and needs to go back to what worked well.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the best book I've read in a long time. Can't wait to see the movie...I wanted to read the book first. Other people had recommended reading the book before watching the movie.
0425252868|4.0|I must admit that I read this book with mixed emotions.  There's no doubt that it is well written and substantial research was necessary to put all these facts together. However I feel the author presented Franz Siegler as a hero, while I looked at him as heroic, but I didn't think of him as a hero. Siegler claimed to be fighting for his country, but his country was Nazi Germany. However he also flew over 480 missions against those who were fighting to prevent the advance of Nazi Germany. I wonder who Siegler thought would be running the world had his country been victorious? Yet he fought on for victory. There can be no question of his bravery, but I am still puzzled at his continuous denial of a NAZI Germany. The Charlie Brown episode is unquestionably one that is beyond the norm.  Here again, Franz Siegler saved a crew of American airmen who went on to survive twenty-eight missions over Germany. Meanwhile Franz Siegler continued on his road to Acedom, by killling hundreds of American Airmen. He often expresses dismay that he is unable to get into the air to fight.I think this is mostly the story of an airman Franz Siegler. The Charlie Brown episode was only one of the many experiences this German Ace experienced during the entire war; esperiences which the author relates to us in great detail. He continued to fight for the Nazi cause which he claimed to detest a cause that took him from Africa, to Italy. to France, to Bavaria to most places in Europe that Nazi Germany had tried to conquer. I do recommend that anyone interested in the happenings of World War II read this book. As I said I read it with mixed emotions while considering Spiegler to be nothing more that a flier whose job it was to kill the enemy. which he did with extraordinary success. I find that I cannot admire him.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Great movie and great quality. I was really happy with this movie overall. I will definitely be streaming movies again through Amazon!

B0076DELIG|4.0|I've enjoyed reading Michael Connelly for the last few years and have by now read most of his work. This was a reliably good one that I very much enjoyed. It was not quite as dark and disturbing as some of his other work, but I actually appreciated that.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I honestly thought I'd take forever reading this book, but it's definitely a page turner!  So many times I seriously wanted to choke the life of out the dad!  They say what doesn't kill you makes you stronger and this book is proof.  In many ways it reminded me of the book \\"The Painted Bird\\" by Jerzy Kerzinski(?).  Both endured numerous suffering at the hands of those we are taught to trust and respect, namely adults and the church.<br />Luckily, I was born in the post-war era of the 50's/60's in the U.S.  Although we too; went to bed hungry, we seldom had heat,water and electricity (because my dad was nearly identical to Frank's) yet somehow we persevered.  And we did what it took to better ourselves as each generation should.<br />Children today whine about how \\"rough\\" they have it if they can't get a cell phone, I-pad, expensive dress and limo for the prom etc.  Most have everything handed to them, without question or earning it.  If only they could spend time in countries where a scrap of bread and clean water are considered luxuries!<br />But I rant away needlessly...READ this book and perhaps the Painted Bird and thank the Good Lord for every day you wake!

B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Other reviews are saying it needs more time. Its a demo. Demos usually don't have a lot of time. If you like the demo then buy the game. If you dislike the game, then don't.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|I love bingo but this game freezes up and I have had a terrible problem with getting my credits. I will purchase them and I receive a message confirming my purchase but the credits don't download. I wish you would correct the problem and quit sending a \\"form email \\" advising you are aware of the problem and workingbto correct it!!!
B00AO686MY|5.0|A must buy!!  Def worth the price!  The quality looks pretty good considering how old the film is and it's shocking (in a good way) how clear is it.  Now being older, some of the jokes and plot make much more sense ;)
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The story lines are intriguing and unusual.<br />The language is rich in vocabulary and allusion.<br />The viewers (at least this one) are becoming more attached to the characters as their personalities unfold.
0553062182|5.0|Tthis book changed my life. It helped me to understand so many things about myself that were always a mystery. I found out I'm a hIghly sensitive person!

B006LSZECO|4.0|One of those books you can't put down, but as many others have written, the end was a let down. Any more than that would need a spoiler alert.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This album is very inspiring. You take a kid singer song writer living in poverty and put his stuff on a record you are looking for some pain. What Rodriguez does is give you a will to fight the system and try and succeed. It is a major shame that nobody bought the album. When the movie Searching for the Sugarman came out I wasn't going to watch it but had nothing else to watch so I put it on. Thank God I did because if I didn't I would have never heard this man's music. I was amazed at the level of popularity he achieved in South Africa and never knew about it.......Unreal. Watch the movie and buy the disc you will not be disappointed my friend I assure you!!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|i love this album it works for cleaning cooking and working out! i can't imagine my life with out it!

1592536913|5.0|What a wonderful book! There are so many pictures of great art and steampunk examples. This will definitely inspire with mix media art work in the steampunk style.
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|Over the years I have purchased several Seiko watches mostly for everyday wear. This is a robust watch with a time tested automatic movement. It's a diver that you can actually use for diving. It's a great casual watch and if you add the Seiko oyster band with solid end links you will have a great looking dive watch. This is a perfect watch for someone looking for a time piece with a self winding movement that won't require battery changes. The automatic movement allows the second hand to sweep relatively smoothly around the dial. The lume is second to none, and that includes my Omega Seamaster. Each turn of the bezel produces a satisfying click. In my opinion this is the best value in this particular watch segment.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|Okay so I have been getting B's all year. Now my  English teacher recommended this book to me because he saw how hard it was for me to bring my B up to an A. So I got it you know think what can I lose its free for goodness sake. So I tried it an actually made me B into an A. So anyway I was so happy that I did use this book. Because it like seriously helped me out a lot. I would definitely recommend this book to kids like me struggling in English like I was. Plus it's free what do you have to lose.
B00BAB6CNC|5.0|I love Stone Sour and I can't wait to see them again on Rock on the Range on May 18th in Columbus OH.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This dictionary really helped me. Like when we were doing a school play I needed to define a lot of words because I like to feel part and know what I am saying. This dictionary also helps with school essays. Like one time I was doing a very difficult essay and our teacher said that he wanted us to staring different vocabulary. And to use bigger words. So I used this book to help me define words for my essay. So this dictionary not only helped with my grades but it also helped me improve my vocabulary. So that is why I gave this dictionary a five star rating. I recommend this book to students who need help with vocabulary and need help to define their school works words. It worked for me. Now I'm not saying that it works for everybody but you should defiantly give it a try. And it's free so what do you have to loose.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love this game. I could play for hours. I really the different layouts. Great game to have !<br />I enjoy the timers it gives a special play against yourself feel.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas Sparks departs from his usual love stories in Safe Haven, and scores a home run.  His protagonist is an abused woman completely dominated by a controlling husband.  The portrayal of the roles the abused woman and her abusive husband fall into were right on target with domestic abuse patterns in relationships.  I was caught up in her struggle to plan, escape and forge a new identity.  Underneath her seemingly safe, new life in a small town, the tenacious tenacles of her husband are reaching and groping to find her. Couldn't put it down!
B004GFN11A|3.0|I believe it's the only blog editor for Android (correct me), so like it or not, we're pretty stuck, no? As an app, it does what it's supposed to do - 60% of the time. I've only posted, added tags and edited posts on it but have yet to directly upload photos so can't comment on that specifically.<br /><br />When it DOESN'T work, it refuses to allow me to exit the post editor, so I'm forced to continue on Amazon's silk browser (my tablet Chrome doesn't seem optimised for Wordpress edit either).<br /><br />The other day, this app enraged me by crashing twice in the middle of a post, so I have learnt to write on a note app first, then copy it in. Yet another step in our all-important blog-updating work!<br /><br />As a blog-writing app, it has its heart in the right places and, when it works, is such a beauty to use. Even though it's highly unstable, I still prefer to post direct from it instead of having to go into browser.<br /><br />But the app developers really need to troubleshoot and update.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy the challenges in this game. If you enjoy hidden object games, you will like this one. Enjoying right now.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|Not sure why it did not impress me.  Looked so forward to seeing it.  Really liked Josh Hutcherson but Jennifer Lawrence character was hokey or something.  Maybe too much information in too short of time.  Not much they could do about that.  I probably won't watch it again.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|I love my watch, works good, wear resistance but for some reason when i have it laying down for over a day it just stops. i would really like to know why it does that and for it not to stop, but over all its works like a charm
B0055QYKQO|2.0|The board has a ton of great features, but be aware, due to VRM overheating, a non-overclocked FX8350 WILL be throttled to about 3.4ghz when stressed to full load (it'll switch between that and full speed rapidly to try and keep VRM temps normal). Due to this, I cannot recommend this board if you plan on overclocking or have an FX8350. I really wish I had learned of this earlier as I'd return this board. As it stands, I can't afford to replace it, so I'm stuck with it. Gigabyte is aware of this issue, but states it plans to do nothing, as it \\"only happens when overclocking\\". This is completely false, as myself and many others have VRM throttling without any overclock. This problem occurs in ALL 990FXA and 990XA Gigabyte boards.<br /><br />Edit: For those wondering, Amazon will send you Rev.3 of this board, which does NOT have the ability to turn off APM (which would prevent the VRM throttling).

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Basic and simple, but does everything that I need. Useable without getting so complex that  it becomes difficult to use.
B005SAV9SO|5.0|Great movie and great humor. This movie is a good example of what teachers shouldn't do. Very good ending and plot.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|I am very happy with my product that I have purchased but the only thing wrong is that it only works in my laptop not in any of my DVD players. I think it may be because I'm in Australia and its from America. We must have different codes or something.

1439153663|5.0|This book will bring you tears, cheers and emotional outbreaks.  Well worth your time to experience.<br />I was wishing for a family tree so I could follow the characters better but I would not reduce my rating for that.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|An unusual book about Nazi Germany which follows the story of the war, Hitler, devastation, and the power words can have to incite evil or to heal and connect. I was drawn into Liesel's story step by step. Be prepared for a sad ending, but the characters and story made it a worthy read.
B0035Q4AFC|4.0|This is a sweeping epic on the life of Charlie Chaplin. It has a point of view and it is surprisingly superficial in some aspects. It is a long (21/2 hours) and at times slow moving, and besides the amount of spectacle and as they say &#34;money on the screen&#34;, it is most important because of the performance of Robert Downey Jr. It is hard to imagine anyone else with the talent both physical and intellectual, who could have taken on this role. The artistic conceit necessary to attempt to portray Chaplin is extraordinary, and the fact that he is able to be convincing to those of us who remember and revere Chaplin, is almost unimaginable. Any one interested in acting, film, art, history, or simply wishing to see a great artist at work, and to try and understand the forces that try personal achievement, should see this film.
B000FC1192|5.0|I read this book in one night. I couldn't put it down. It reminded me of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, with aspects of a talking cat, a strange new world, a curious little girl. But this book was creepy and delightful at the same time. This book is great to read aloud. The reader will triumph at the end with Coraline. Gaiman is a genius. The language  he uses to write this book is superb.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|The book describes his training and kill experiences but I think he could have limited the number of kills and explained in more detail each one rather than short narratives of most of them.  Not a very in depth picture or maybe he was just a machine that went bang - bang - bang.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Even my daughter loved it. We hardly used the hints, maybe 3 times or so. I want to find another game like this. Best one I've played.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The music and artists on the performance were incredible.  It was beautifully put together.<br />I would  say that anyone who likes good rock and roll, or George's version, incl. the eastern element, would love this as a gift or possession.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the book and wanted to continue reading the series. It is a nice way to share with the family.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Stop reading. Really.<br /><br />Okay - if you're still reading, hopefully you watched it first. My husband was after me for days to watch this movie. He'd seen it on a flight back from England and I knew it had won the Academy Award for Best Documentary but I didn't understand what all the hype was. Now I do. It is nothing short of magical.<br /><br />Here's a remarkable artist who made beautiful, heartfelt music that didn't do anything in the US but helped the young people of South Africa find the courage to challenge apartheid. He never knew. He gave up on a music career and vested his energies on raising some beautiful children who seem as gentle and kind as he is.<br /><br />Many people have compared his sound to Bob Dylan's but I found him to be a little more like Donovan. His lyrics are profoundly moving and transcendant. It does something good for your soul to know that somewhere in this universe, someone had a dream - someone more than worthy - more than talented - and it touched millions of lives and in the end, a genuinely worthy person sees a dream realized. He is a beautiful person who makes beautiful music. Yes. I loved this movie. I loved how so many people never gave up on this man. Despite obfuscation by his record label, he wasn't bitter. He was happy it happened at all - like he expected it all along. He should have - he's that good.

0770435726|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book.  All the reviews I read led me to believe this book was outstanding.  I found it an interesting story but not up to my expectations.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|Super great movie, it had to be from the privilege mind of Almodovar. I enjoyed it from beginning to end, the spectator cannot move until the end. Antonio Banderas was excellent as always.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Receiving lots of comments/praise/rebuttal from many sides. Alexander documents what he experienced when bacterial meningitis effectively shut down his neocortex.  He makes limited interpretation of his experience, which is one of the strengths of the book.  The toughest critics, and in my opinion the most unfair, are the ones who try to assume Alexander is making theological conclusions beyond the most simple (\\"We are loved.\\"), which he admits as much he is not.  Karen and I both read this and were inspired in our faith in God, and that Jesus is the Way.  We didn't feel the book contradicted anything in orthodox Christian thought or practice.
0451228731|2.0|pros:<br />The story kept my interest enough to keep reading.<br />Good plot<br />Author's understanding of science and technology are accurate<br />Most of the book was well written with well developed characters<br /><br />cons<br />unnecessary and perverse pornographic episodes which had NO relationship to plot development,character development,or the rest of the book.Simply gratuitous to please those people looking for such in a book.<br /><br />unnecessary violence which was for the same reasons as the pornographic ones.<br /><br />excessive bad language which was not only irritating,but for some characters took away from the believability that the author had worked to develop in them.<br /><br />some episodes where the author said the same thing over and over for pages.<br /><br />peter

B000FA675C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book again.  Lots of suspense, and surprises.  Very enjoyable.  Read it in two settings, and will seek out more books by Robert Landon.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|I did not see this movie in theaters. I saw it on DVD by word of mouth. Someone whose opinion I trust recommended this movie saying it was good. I watched the movie and now I own it. this is a darker take on the Snow white legend and I like darker takes on classic fairytales. Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth give solid Performances. The one who surprised me the most was Kristen Stewart.I was Surprised that that not only can Kristen Stewart emote, but she can act too. I guess I should not be Surprised that Kristen Stewart can act like she has been locked in a tower for over a decade. Granted, I avoid Twilight like the plague because no one in that series can act However now I will have to rephrase that.  No one Can Act in a series like twilight. In a movie like this or others the actors are actually competent because they have roles with varying degrees of depth. I liked Snow White and The Huntsman and Like my Friend who recommended it to me I would recommend this movie to others.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|If this is an app for kids it should be much more self explanatory. Very difficult to understand how and why things work. I was disappointed as I watched my 5 year old struggle.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|Intro<br />Two of my friends managed to convince me to read Patrick Rothfuss' \\"Name of the Wind.\\" That and its sequel, \\"Wise Man's Fear,\\" each caused a week of work to disappear. Those two books and an unreleased sequel comprise Kvothe's story of his life. Kvothe is a famous wizard who grew up in a travelling troupe and, thus, has an appreciation for putting on a good show. In other words, it is a story about a storyteller, a story with an emphasis on stories. Needless to say, it is told well.<br /><br />The Lies we Tell Ourselves to Get to Sleep<br />I like that there is an emphasis on constructing reality. There are facts about the world, but there are also the lies that we tell ourselves and make true. As a kid, he stands by in hiding while a group beats up another child. Talking about that experience, he says, \\"That is why I became the Kvothe that they tell stories about. I still remember it. I made my choice, and I still regret it.\\" With his regret, he thinks of himself as the type of person who does intervene for others, and he thinks of it as a common duty. As a result, after running through an inferno to save someone that he barely knows, he says that \\"Anyone would have done that.\\"<br /><br />I have experienced the same myself. My first step to becoming vegetarian actually didn't involve any deeper ethical understanding. In fifth grade, there was something called Taste Sensation, where we would eat a different food each week. We had rattlesnake and frog legs (yum on both accounts). We had snail (I kind of puked after eating it). But I didn't want to eat spam, so I got out of it by saying that I didn't eat red meat (lying). However, I don't think of myself as someone who lies. So after that, I didn't eat red meat (except for that one time that I didn't know that \\"pancetta\\" is Italian for \\"seasoned bacon\\" even than \\"pan\\" is Spanish for \\"bread\\").<br /><br />That is, perhaps, why I am less hard on hypocrisy than some other people. I don't think of a hypocrite as someone who is living in contradiction with themselves. I think of a hypocrite as someone whose reach exceeds their grasp today and whose grasp might extend tomorrow.<br /><br />When presented with the Peter Singer Solution to World Poverty (people should donate their money until they hit the $40,000 per year line, since at that level they definitely have everything you need to survive and thrive, and $200 can save a life), I agreed with it. He makes his case off of simple utilitarian philosophy, and I agree with utilitarianism and with his logic. However, at that point, I didn't donate all of my surplus money, and I still don't. But I've gradually gotten more generous, and now I donate about $200 per month to charitable organizations.<br /><br />This internal desire for consistency is one of Cialdini's principles of persuasions that I learned about in URBANST132, a class on social entrepreneurship, and in Transformative Design. If a person commits to something, especially if they commit to it in a public way, they are much more likely to follow through with it.<br /><br />Heroism<br />The self-fulfilling nature of stories is as true with regard to external perceptions of a person as it is for internal values. Kvothe puts a lot of effort into building his reputation as a superhuman hero, and the books about Kvothe are him telling the real story behind the heroic stories that others tell of him. In a way, my verbose letters are my own way of telling my store, though I am nowhere near as heroic as Kvothe.<br /><br />He spends his time at the University, dwelling place of the most talented people of his time. To get in requires high education, and to stay there requires steep costs in tuition and supplies. Kvothe, an independently financed orphan, manages to become one of the most famous people in the world because he begins constructing the image of himself as famous early on, and he doesn't stop constructing it or attempting to live up to it.<br /><br />He doesn't even attempt to live up to all of his stories. He intentionally spreads enough rumors about himself that people can't always tell truth from fiction. What he does live up to is the persona. He was enamored, as a child, by fairy tales of great wizards with command over the elements, who can \\"call down fire and lightning\\" on their enemies. He spends much of the series trying to gain this power, but he spends as much time making it seem like he already has the power.<br /><br />As a result, he shares his glory and hides his grief. He can never ask anyone for help except for his small, trusted circle. When he wins a contest by pushing himself nearly to the point of collapse, he has to go into the hallway to compose himself. In order to pay for his tuition, he has to ask for money from a dangerous moneylender to avoid asking his friends. No one sees his weakness, and as a result, he is famous. He is not the best wizard (though he is always among the best), but he appears that way.<br /><br />With the \\"Mask of Masculinity,\\" my culture has helped me along that path too. The most obvious way might be my academic persona. The shadow that I cast works nonstop, tirelessly, and exclusively for causes related to social change. Not only that, but everything comes easy to that shadow. I study biocomputation, so my shadow is an expert in computer science and natural science; I study human computer interaction and design, so my shadow is an expert in working with user needs; I lead organizations and study social entrepreneurship, so my shadow is an excellent leader; and I did debate, so my shadow is an expert in the social sciences and humanities.<br /><br />But again, it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. I am not my shadow, but I can only stray so far from it while still casting it as it is. In high school, the people on my debate team thought that I did so much work, and they thought that my partner did less work, but I always thought that my partners contributed as much as me (and I said as much, but the persona stayed). They probably didn't think that I spent as much time watching TV or playing video games as I did. As a result, I had to spend a little more time working to keep up with my image, and I always followed through on my outward commitments.<br /><br />In college, that has continued. My persona doesn't play video games as much as I do. As a result, in public situations, I am unlikely to be seen playing video games except with my friends. My persona has about twice as many commitments as the average Stanford student and succeeds at them all. But success isn't enough, so I also make cookies to demonstrate the ease with which I do everything. In work situations, I may not be the most skilled, but I can succeed independently or with other people, and I'm usually among the first in and last out of the office.<br /><br />I was surprised to learn that it even extends to physical feats. At the beginning of high school, I was still scrawny (now I'm only scrawny by comparison to my friends that remind some of hulks), but I never shrugged the burden of carrying my tubs of debate evidence or doing physical work. I was walking with someone around the dish (a hilly area that has Stanford's research dish: see [...]) the other day, and she commented that I was the one doing all of the talking, and yet I wasn't even panting. In fact, I was exerted, and if I wasn't panting, it was a matter of composure, not a matter of physical fitness.<br /><br />Independence also. After I started doing debate in high school, I was away from my home and family for the first time over weekends, and I was fine. Not only that, but I was superbly prepared. I prided myself on having all of the office supplies (or snacks, or bandaids, or anything else) that any of my teammates would need. Debate camp was my first time away from my family for more than a weekend, and I made myself seem as comfortable there as anywhere even though I would be away for a month or two and I wassuffering homesickness.<br /><br />As a result, when I went to college, I didn't suffer the same difficulties that some of my peers did. I could independently manage my life. Even though I had never been abroad, I was comfortable traveling on my own to program in Cambodia for a summer. The way that I am independent has changed, though. Where in my childhood, I was independent through preparation, now I am independent through demeanor, which is to say that now I pack light where before I packed heavy. I am now very much a nomad: given no more than what I can carry in my backpack and on my person, I am comfortable staying in any city in the world for any amount of time with as little preparation as is necessary.<br /><br />In my class on Transformative Design, one thing that I learned was that a powerful way to build loyalty is through identity. Apple has created a cult of people who buy their products because they identify as Apple people and, thus, will buy a closed-down and overpriced product because it has an apple on it. Buying Apple products is a part of their identity. Kvothe follows a similar path. He sees the world a certain way. He sees his own place in that world, and that is his identity. He wears it as his skin. It is bound just as tightly to him, as is mine to me.<br /><br />I taught a class this spring, CS1U, and the professor who was helping me with it said that I was a finisher. That is to say, when I commit to something, it is a part of me, and it will be finished. My identity as an independent, fit, public servant at the forefront of design and computer science may be a shadow, but come rain or shine, hell or high water, I have my identity, and it is the most important thing that I have.said as much, but the persona stayed).

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I watch all the movies andf founfd myself watching most of the extra content on the 5th disk. If you like Dr. Jones you can't go wrong with this. Also Raiders looks GREAT!!
B00003CX95|5.0|Saw this again last night. This is the best movie of my life. Great entertainment. great inspiration. Way to go Mel Gibson.<br />I could be snippy and complain about historical innacuracies but hey, let's face it, if Mel  Gibson had not made this movie, no one would even have ever heard of who? William Wallace? Is he Mike Wallace's cousin?<br />Looking at it a second time I could not help but notice that Mel was gutted on a cross and the way they dragged him in to the drawing and quartering process seemed sort of biblical like.<br />Mel Gibson is great, the way he kept the suspense going at the end of the first battle for a pregnant 10 seconds or so and then gave out a guttural ape scream was just too apposite. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. I have often thought of that moment, one of the best in movie history as far as I am concerned. No fancy words, no pretensions, just a extended grunt/scream of triumph. Perfect.<br />It might not appeal to the more verbal amongst us but the timing and expression were...what...spot on.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I will forever remember 11/22/63 as the day that Kennedy was assassinated not because my favorite History teacher, Mr. Morgan, was so good at ways to help his students memorize dates, but because my favorite author, Mr. King, is so good at submersing his readers in a world sprung from his mind.<br />This book is so well written and so interesting.<br />King's plots, although sometimes way outlandish, always find a way to become believable. King always provides just enough information about his characters to make them easy to relate to, yet leaves you second guessing your ability to determine who's good and who's twisted.<br />The beauty is in the details, so please, take a chance and wonder down the rabbit hole.
B008I34YYY|5.0|What could be better than that? A really fun movie, firmly tongue in cheek and very campy. If you like spoofs, you'll love this.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I so enjoyed this book. I read this book because it took place in the Irish countryside and Im fascinated with all things, places and times about Ireland.From the first pages I was hooked on the main character and the unfolding of his life. Thank you Christina McKenna for a lovely read. Sincerely, Carol Gray
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I Love This App I'm Really In Love. Im On It Everyday This Game Is My Life Saver(: &lt;3 &lt;3
0307744434|5.0|I'm surprised I enjoyed this book so much. I typically don't like it when (1) there is very little character development, (2) the timeline jumps seemingly randomly back and forth, and (3) long descriptions of scenery are included. Additionally, I can't think of a single book I've ever enjoyed that centered on a circus. But there's something entrancing about The Night Circus that made me love it in spite of all my usual preferences. I highly recommend this book to even the biggest skeptics (like me)!
B005ERX1Z0|4.0|They don't make movies like Cannonball Run anymore. Star studded situational comedy, with a simple premise, and just lots of fun. Even better in Blu-ray.
B00CEIGYAG|4.0|Not their greatest track ever, but if you're a fan of them its definitely worth getting. Great catchy track, can't wait for the album version.
B004GYY714|5.0|The variety of music channels is incredible, and from all over the world! Great fun! Thanks for bringing all this music to my world!
B009GIPDQS|4.0|Wasn't sure where the book was heading initially but eventually it all came together and a good ending.<br /><br />Not too impressed with the Kindle cost Mr Grisham and your publishers (A$24.95)! I could have purchased the book on release for $A19 at Big W and Target in Perth, Western Australia. Relented after some months since publication date as I was heading overseas but I will probably take the book in future and leave it for others en route to lighten the load.
B0031RS44S|5.0|Love Jack Reacher, great from the first chapter, I initially downloaded the sample version and was hooked, had to get the full version!
1452110581|5.0|Gave this book to my sister as a present because she has a cat that pees on everything...so it was especially funny. She loved the book and laughed and quoted from it often.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I recommend this book to those who don't mind slowing down a little to put together all the scientific complexities that the author uses to great affect.  The story is well paced, well written and has an excellent finish.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This was simply an amazing film to watch, so historically  accurate and well dramatized. Wish Hollywood would make more like this in the future.
B008Y768XO|4.0|It's not my favorite kind of movie, but it was good. Well-acted and interesting enough. I watched it with my 7 year old daughter, and we cried together. I like that the story was based on truth.

B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I loved the novel and could not imagine how it could be made into a film.<br />Ang Lee does an amazing job and holds true to the novel.<br />How did they get the animals appear like that, truly a wonder of digital film .
B0050DIWFC|1.0|This book is not good. The characters are underdeveloped and the plot is thin. Do not read it, you will be disappointed.
B0064IOZY4|5.0|a bit more laid back but still with the excitement that sets your mind wandering to places of contemplation and exploration
B0084BMUFA|5.0|What a wonderful and uplifting book.  I am sorry it took me so long to read this book and Charles dickens.

1579125549|4.0|Of course 5334 chess puzzles is a lot of puzzles to solve, but i managed to solve around 800 of them within an hour. The book starts by teaching you the basics of chess (moving pieces). Then the books has 300 1-move checkmates and then it goes to about a 1000 2-move checkmates and then the numbers increase to like 2300 3-move checkmates. The book comes with answers and is great to teach students with, but it just doesn't teach you much that can't learn by yourself. Also there is no in depth explanations of the checkmates or how to find them just tells you the moves and gives you the answers. It's a great book to increase your perception in chess. If you play chess and want to improve, i'd get another book on endgames or openings like the sicilian dragon. but if you have trouble seeing checkmate, this is your book!
B00BY7NK96|4.0|This book provides a good discussion of the issues surrounding women succeeding/not succeeding as they climb their career ladders. It inspired me in some ways and perhaps I disagreed in some others, but that is a sign of a good book. I don't want to just read something that I totally agree with, I want something that helps me to think outside of whatever box I've put myself into.
B0043VDIAG|4.0|I thought it was a good read but a bit predictable until the end which was a bit of a surprise.
B004W2UBYW|3.0|it was great at the time of Job's death but not a great keeper. Kind of a recreational type of book.
B007RCJNDE|5.0|Fourteen books is a marathon - but well worth the effort.  Yes, there are some mis-steps, but Book 14 neatly ties up all the loose ends with some \\"realism\\" - some of the \\"good guys\\" die and don't get to live happily ever after, but it's the ending you want, but in an unexpected way.  The only negative for me was that I couldn't put it down and am now sleep deprived!  Recommended for lovers of the genre who have run the marathon of the previous books in the series.
1592403913|4.0|i have read this book a few times and because i liked it so<br />for friends including two college professors.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|The movie was very good and JIm Carey's performance was sensational.  I would recommend anyone who likes a good movie to buy the Truman Show.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I has been a family tradition for many years to watch this video on February 2nd and will continue to happen for years to come.  We enjoy the humor over and over even knowing what is coming next.  Kind of like the movie. We relive Ground Hog Day new each time we watch it.

B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I REALLY LIKE NICKOLAS SPARKS BOOKS .THEY ARE NICE CLEAN BOOK READING. THIS BOOK WAS VERY GOOD JUST LIKE ALL THE OTHER ONES I HAVE THEM ALL.<br />.
B007704PRU|4.0|*NOTE: By default, review contains spoilers of the first book in the series.*<br /><br />I enjoyed Pandemonium but not as much as Delirium, possibly because there was no Alex. I missed Alex greatly.<br /><br />I thought Lauren Oliver did a brilliant job of extending Lena's character arc, showing us how life in the Wilds - not to mention Alex's death - hardened and changed her. If you compare Lena at the start of Delirium to Lena at the end of Pandemonium, you'll see plenty of changes, which all develop organically throughout the two books. I hope this growth continues in Requiem.<br /><br />Now onto Julian, the youth leader of Deliria-Free America. I really liked Julian and how he changed throughout the story but I never quite bought his and Lena's love story. Actually, it's not that I didn't buy it, it's that I didn't want to buy it, because I was still too in love with Alex-and-Lena.<br /><br />The best parts of this book, for me, were when Julian shared his experiences about the forbidden study (All You Need is Love) and his brother's rebellion. I also thought Oliver made some interesting statements about the place of the disfigured in a 'perfect' society. I'm hoping to see Coin and co. play a part in bringing down the establishment in Requiem - which I'm off to start reading straight away now that it's been released!
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Classic Tarantino....full of action and awesome casting. Exagerated violence added to the comedy. The story is fantastic. Absolutely loved it.

B005IQZB14|5.0|Well written, thoughtful, funny and moving. I couldn't put it down. I would also recommend her book 'Tiny, Beautiful Things'. You will laugh, cry and wish Cheryl Strayed was your BFF.
B008RPB7AW|4.0|Should be read by any dog owner, but can be  bit tiring because it covers the same ground a few times and overuses the rhetorical question as a lead in to topics. Well worth the read in spite of this. The author has a keen behavioural eye and the subject is wee- researched.

B00BTHV05M|5.0|The more I listen to this album, the more I love it.  But, then again I am a bit One Republic fan. I have all their albums. Great music to listen to when your are driving. I know the trade magazines only gave it 3 1/2 stars, but I think they are way off.  Each song is unique in sound and melody and lyrics. I you are a big fan of One Republic, I recommend this album.
B007THA4FI|1.0|I had a hard time finding anyone among the mean, petty, cruel & vindictive people in this book to care about.  I'm still wondering what the point of the book is.  It brings to mind the Pink Floyd lyric \\"...hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way...\\".
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Saw this in the theater and had to buy the blu-ray combo (although I am not one for the special features or have a 3D TV yet -- I will get around to both eventually). Even if you aren't a gamer and don't get the in-jokes, you will like this fun film.

B00A2LFXVI|3.0|The first part of this film came with the Ultraviolet version this one does not. I was extremely disappointed by that as I actually watch it more on my streaming devices than I will on the DVD. WB should not have given it to us on the first part if they weren't giving it to us on the second part, but then again I guess it just their way of making us shell out more money for the digital copy if we want both parts.

B0077EBWVI|5.0|Two Rising Stars are Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough on their way to making it in the Acting, Dancing, Singing, and Popularity categories of our times.  Director Craig Brewer did a wonderful directing job of bringing a movie up from the 1984 version to the 2011 era we are now living.  At 65 I could of gotten up and danced along with them and guess what I did.  Change of story just enough to make it right for today's teens.  Dennis Quaid and Andy McDowell were perfect as the preacher and his wife they even made the movie more realistic by being in it.<br /><br />Trust is a big issue and if they do not earn your trust in them then a time out or grounding is correct for any teen.  Once they know you are the parent and not their Friend, as well as NOT buying their Love.  This helps them Respect you, as the parent and the teens will be trustworthy and make each parent proud to say that is my son or daughter.<br /><br />No child is perfect at what ever age they grow because of our guidance and values, as well as morals.

0786955570|5.0|Let\\"s face it- D&D Ravenloft campaign setting was extremely nasty.You could suffer ill effects just from being there!<br /><br />Yes the Castle Ravenloft boardgame is extremely nasty, too. The encounter cards actually put more fear in my heart than the monsters did, since a black arrow on a tile meams you must resolve an encounter card AND a monster card.<br /><br />I've only yet played the first solo scenario three times and been crushed three times. One encounter card called for a monster to be activated on every unexplored map tile edge. This led to FOUR monsters being activated and another activated for placing the tile itself. This led to highly masochisticly amusing chase where running away caused more tiles to be placed, more monsters activated, more dreaded encounter cards.<br /><br />In the end, Count Von Strahd activated, chased me down, put me out of my misery. If this sounds like fun, buy this game NOW. Personally, I find the brutality of Castle Ravenloft refreshing. Unfair at times? Yes. Over the top at times? Yes. A DM I used to play with used Ravenloft setting as a purgatory for annoying players. If someone was rude or disruptive, all this DM had to do was say the word \\"Ravenloft\\" and they would adjust thier behavior. This boardgame adaptation of Ravenloft is true to the campaign world it is based upon.

B00AKKGX4W|4.0|Loved all three novels in this grouping.  Liked the writing style very much and would read anything else Courtney Milan writes.
B00AUU2KI0|4.0|This is a really great story. The book is expertly written, although it does drag a bit in places. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because the author introduces a situation in the beginning where Pi ends up following three different religions at once. He is confused. The author never brings any closure to this conundrum in the book. Did he choose one or is he still following all three? This is never addressed.

No problems connecting an ipod, iphone and ipad. But apparently the kindle version doesn't play nice. I want to return it but Amazon makes this exceedingly difficult. -1 for Minecraft, Kindle, AND Amazon.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Great performances throughout the entire cast.  I like how the music was updated for more modern times.  I am not  big fan of musicals but this one hit it right on.
B007P7UF06|5.0|Camelot has always been one of my favorite stories.  I had a DVD but wanted te BluRay version for my HD TV.  It is great.  I love the music and drama.  It truly does happen &#34;....at night, of course....in Camelot...&#34;
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game doesn't get old too quickly like most do. recommended highly by myself and everyone I know who has played it
B002ACQGAO|3.0|It is difficult to be too hard on this show since it blows away most on TV, however season one is the jewel here. Seasons 2 is fun because of the development of T-Bag, shown to be an excellent actor who makes this season go. Season 3 sort of the same old thing only in Sona, and season 4 just stinks, particularly the final episodes (I mean Mike is shot in left shoulder in one scene, then holds his right shoulder in the next)! Indicative of the slip shod handling of the production down the stretch. How can the show end without LJ Jr. hugging Daddy? etc.<br />So, buy season one to have forever and watch the rest for free. My two cents anyway.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Great game for the kindle, very addicting. You can use real money if you'd like but you don't need too. Still fun stealing peeps money...
1609611543|4.0|This book was informative about the Gluten free life.  I learned much in reading it and would recommend to those who are learning how to life a life without Glue-tin.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|Yet another beautiful song written by our Robot overlords. Daft Punk has proven time and time that music still has heart & soul, and with Get Lucky you get all of that. I Pre-Purchased the vinyl, and bought this song, and feel like every penny was well spent. If you have a dollar and some change, I suggest you buy this track.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|A great action about a great horse about being taken from his owner and then finding each other during The Great War.
B008ER9QKG|4.0|Am I the only one who, after searching through these reviews--ostensibly for the 2012 Met production (yes, the one with the \\"planks\\") that is confused by what appears to be a mushing-together of reviews for both past and most-recent Ring Cycles? Commentary on performers jumps between Jerusalem and Morris, etc. etc. Reviewers appear to  reference 2010, 20 years ago, and 2012... I'm just sayin'...
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|So different from previous tracks. The vocals of Pharrell is fantastic on this song. I have been waiting for this album and can't wait to hear the rest.
0465068367|5.0|a very good read and i hope more people can come read this book and we all need to remember the history
B00632HWOG|2.0|I thought using this would make it easier to send messages out to my mailing list, but not only would they still not send because yahoo was considering it spam it was also hoarding them in an &#34;outbox&#34; basically never to be sent or even worse to randomly be sent out after the auction sale is over...ridiculous the amount of spam that we get but I can't get out a simple auction date to my customers...
B004Q3SGWG|2.0|this is about you would expect. a long movie. you sit and look at close ups of the guys face thinking &#34;I would have already cut my arm off, No one knows I'm here. What other choice do I have&#34;. Unless you are stuck on movies that would have done well in 60s, don't watch this. Watch 2001 instead.
0062231375|5.0|Love his frankness and his humor.  It's nice to see the other side of the &#34;door&#34; in restaurants.  Don't eat fish on Mondays!  I had the unique opportunity to meet Tony and found him to be as he writes - honest, crass, brilliant, well-read and driven like a freight train.  Keep telling it like it is!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Told by a wonderful storyteller. The story of Pi Patel was astounding, beautiful and heartbreaking. I know I will come back to this book again and again to re read the poetic writing style and shocking story of survival.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Another validation from one didn't believe and now does. Doubting Thomas no more! Very well done, very well. Thank you
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is fun and it goes fast.  You really have to be on the ball to win.  Give it a chance.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love it! The horse is so cute and adorable :)  I cant stop playing it, its really fun. Great game!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't stop reading until it was done.  I believe Catniss should stay with Peeta.  I love Gale but I think Peeta is a better choice for Catniss.  Love the book.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|it would be better if they made the full one free or this one have more time to do stuff
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The size and scope of the world and the people you get to know in this season are amazing.  You will feel real emotion towards every one of them.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is a definite upgrade over what came with my Droid Razr Max. The predictive language function is great.
