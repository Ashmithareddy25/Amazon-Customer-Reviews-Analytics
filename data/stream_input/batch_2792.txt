1452113432|5.0|Every Friday I look forward to the 30 minute spot on TV where Rachel Khoo cooks up her tasty French food in her &#34;tiny flat&#34; as she calls it. So you can see why I wanted to purchase the cook book housing all her delicious recipes. I was not disappointed. The recipes are presented in such a simple way making it easy for me to duplicate this wonderful French cuisine. I have tried quite a few of her recipes from this book and they have all turned out perfect. Her instruction is simple, the photos are life like, so much so that you think you should be able to reach into the page, lift them out and begin eating.  My project for today will be Iles Flottantes. All I need is a vanilla bean. Au Revoir
B00BEZTMWW|3.0|Not a Peter Jackson movie and while good the movie missed it's potential. The mvie is worth a look but will disappoint Hobbit fans.
B001VNB54A|5.0|This is an excellent testament to the price of freedom, lest we ever forget.  This film should be mandatory viewing to earn a high school diploma.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|If you enjoy action movies with good CGI you will like this movie.  The dialog is halarious and a very good cast.
B00000J2PH|5.0|My wife can sing most of these songs word for word. Not sure there has been a better piece of work from Carole!
B00CEJ2H6K|4.0|Amon Amarth is one of my favorite bands. CD is good not excellent.<br />Several fine tracks. The bonus tracks are great.
B000002AGN|5.0|Really takes you back to the time when these guys were performing live! Here and there you still hear these hits in some of the TV show of the time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good app to have when you kids or need a brake.  I like having to work my way up. :-)
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I have read ALL of the Jack Reacher books. I'm also a fan of Tom Cruise but unfortunately, he is not Reacher. The movie was too slow and I ended up not bothering to watch the end. Too bad. It really is a great book series with awesome movie potential. But this movie didn't capture the essence of Jack None Reacher and his travels.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|It is a beautiful movie for all family. It is a nice history. We enjoy watching it together. Gogg made.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Great thinking game...just wish it was easier to get crystals without having to buy them.  Otherwise with patience great free game!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a great book. He takes you through his training and previous missions to lay out a great back story, leading up to an historical finnisher.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Great film.Always loved Pres. Lincoln. Got here quickly too and the price was very reasonable.Very thorough and realistic acting! Really gladIbought it.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Not sure why . . But my app keeps opening and then closing just before  it fully loads . . I tried deleting it from my kindle cloud and downloading again but it still doesn't work
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The Language of Flowers, as well as being informative, is a wonderful and touching story.  Armed with the knowledge of the meaning of various flowers, I will be more selective when giving flowers in the future. The author does a wonderful job of imparting knowledge wrapped in a beautiful story.
0764141201|5.0|I am from Italy. To me, phrasal verbs are likely the worst thing to learn and difficult to use.<br />I tried several books to improve my american while taking classes, but this is the only one I wanted to buy, since I found it very helpful.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Awesome<br />The best song to jam to and relax. Gets you in the mood for some dancing. Go daft punk
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|at first I was not sure I thought it would be boring but I was so wrong this movie has everything to be one of the best movies I seeing, great story and all.
B003WH765U|5.0|Without revealing too much in this review, the story of &#34;SAYONARA&#34; is beautiful and tragic, exhibiting the conflicting and/or complementing contrasts of the exotic customs of the Far East versus traditional Western values.<br /><br />I've loved this movie since the first time I ever saw it, and I watch it over and over.<br /><br />It evokes nostalgic memories of my boyhood as an Army brat at Ashiya Air Force Base on the island of Kyushu, Japan, and of my R and R leave in Japan when I was a soldier in the United States Army serving in the old Republic of Viet Nam.<br /><br />In the creativity of this production, there are a couple of blatantly ridiculous flaws, such as a Spaniard portraying a Japanese, and an American composing the Japanese song.<br /><br />Still, the movie is enjoyable enough that, unless it's specifically pointed out, those unbelievable goofs go unnoticed, not detracting anything from the story.<br /><br />The movie is morally clean enough for family viewing, although I think the romantic aspects will have far greater appeal to couples cuddling on the sofa in a darkened living room.<br /><br />Yeah, if you want a DVD to watch with your date, then I very highly recommend, &#34;SAYONARA&#34;.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The kids love it, and this version gives them more adventure than the free version.  I just wish I could get it on the WII.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Hey, how can you go wrong with a cops and robbers action movie with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro pitted against each other?<br /><br />'Nuff said.<br /><br />Get the DVD and have fun!
1452126607|5.0|This is Tardar Sauce and she is the funniest grumpy cat in the world.  Her attitude is priceless.  A definite must have for any cat lover.
B002L5KL5G|5.0|A Bronx Tale has been among our all-time favorite movies for a long time.  DeNiro & Palminteri are brilliant together. Sure, it shows the brutal nature of the mob, but this movie focuses on the good, verses the bad in people.  It depicts a parents' struggle to raise their children with integrity and morals within a criminal environment.  It's a coming of age story, where a boy tries to follow his parents' good example, but finds it difficult to resist the allure of the mob. It has many tender moments and lots of memorable quotes. The saddest thing in life is wasted talent.  Now yous can't leave. Is it better to be loved or feared?  Can you make sauce?  You're not in the mood for steak?!  You know how many times I gotta drive that bus around...
B00CW665VI|5.0|I thought it was a great read. Gotta love Drew. His funny and witty comments. Love the parts when he was talking to the reader, like he knew what you were thinking. To bad he is fictional. Can t wait for book two.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|When he missed the mess that means that the light of day for a good game of the Winds are where I have someone else is leaving it gets to the Winds
B0006J28L4|5.0|I saw the film when I was younger and loved it even then. I think as an adult, I can appreciate the struggle and stress Malcolm X, and his family, must've gone through. This movie is what got me into watching Denzel Washington because he totally owns the role. The only problem I have ever had with this film is the part where the kids in the classroom stand up and shout \\"I am Malcolm X!\\" It grated at me as a 10 year old, and it hasn't gotten any better with age. However, I do appreciate the documentary footage that Spike Lee presents at the end. For me, hearing people who were on the frontline of the Civil Rights movement speak about that time period is more poignant than reading it in a book.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Cool cool cool game good thing do different Xerox from her children need anything else that the light of day and the light of this situation
B005723JSQ|5.0|Interesting and help to relax reading it.<br />Love all Sophie Kinsella's novel.<br />I look forward to reading more new releases!
B0052REUW0|5.0|A brilliant and very important book for the general public as well as professionals in several fields: 1- Historians: this is the way to do history, with hard facts, underlying theory, and also understanding the limits of some data; 2- Journalists: the world is actually getting to be a much better place than ever -- unalloyed negativism is simply not &#34;objective journalism&#34;; 3- Political Scientists and Policymakers: there's much to learn about how to do things right -- as many actually have done.<br />While 800 pages might seem daunting, Pinker's (usual) style of writing makes the &#34;slog&#34; go quite fast. Lots of humor, huge portions of sarcasm about American political correctness, and continual thought-provoking ideas, all render this book a joy to read.<br />Bottom line: an absolute must-read for anyone interested in an exceedingly important trend in human history -- with good news, for once.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|For a few years now I've thought that Grisham has well and truly lost the are of not so much writing a thriller but more in keeping you riveted to the book. The Racketeer is a vast improvement over his last 4-5 books.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a great game! It's like temple run and my option (kindle fire) glitches alot but otherwise it's a AWESOME GAME and it would be cool if as subways surfers fixes the glitches and I saw that you can change the outfit for the characters a'm d on my kindle it won't show up?
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Another child favorite that adults will appreciate also. This is a must have for your child's Disney DVD or movie Collection.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Definitely a good app for keeping occupied. Soon as I downloaded it and opened it the app had me. For anyone who likes a good brain teaser this app is perfect.
0060989157|5.0|This book can really take you back to another time in your life a much wilder time. I enjoyed the book immensely and for a short time felt young again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun, it's easy to kill time playing this. I like that you move left or right by swiping your finger across the screen as opposed to tilting your device to move. It has great quality on my kindle fire and I really haven't had any problems with this. Definitely a great game!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great book loved it. I could not put it down. As soon as i finished it got the next one
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great entertaining game for kids my daughter loves it. Plays it every chance she gets, I even play when I get a chance. Love the movies so great app. Thumbs up !!!
B008M4MB8K|5.0|has all the different cuts of the movie; looks great in HD.  Awesome movie, if you haven't seen it and are a sci-fi fan I would highly recommend it.
B008BP097A|5.0|This woman can sing like no other I love her lyrics and her sound... so sensual and unique<br /> Ms.Gardot more please.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The acting in this movie was great and I liked the fact that although I was able to figure out the fate of Mud; I had no clue what would happen to his love interest.  This movie is certainly entertaining!
1438074085|5.0|Easy to study by yourself. You can check all answers and its quite simple to use. All skills have been trained.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|this is a great game makes you think and you can have fun having other people try and help you I would tell everyone to get this game
034580404X|5.0|These are my absolute favorite books of all time!!! Love, love, love!! The Fifty Shades Trilogy is a must read!!
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this cover.  The color is nice and bright; leather is quality.  The rotation mechanism is well made and this is all around the perfect cover for my Kindle Fire.  I also love that it does not add too much weight or bulkiness to the Kindle, making it still easy to carry in my purse or bag.
B00B9366VO|3.0|This turned out to be a much narrower treatment of the legendary Sound City studio story than I expected, but that is not an uncommon outcome when the executive producer is the host and star of the program.  I salute Dave Grohl for trying to save the Sound City legacy, but this could have been a much better documentary with other eyes driving the production.
0375842209|5.0|I love this book!  Plenty of others gave a synopsis.  I want to rave about the way the story invites you in and keeps you wanting to know what will happen next.  Zusak did an amazing job of making Death both somber yet funny at times.  The characters are well developed, the plot is engaging, and the overarching themes keep you thinking.  This is a true treasure!
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I'm 65 years old now, but I remember well my introduction to Edgar Rice Burroughs's John Carter books the summer I was ten. I had never been so entranced by anything I had read in just the way I was by these books. I wondered why no John Carter book had ever been made into a movie -- and now one has! Of course it does not follow the book exactly -- movies usually don't -- but it's still a glorious piece of film-making, whether you are an old-time fan like me or not. The settings and characters LOOK just as they should, much as I envisioned them. The story is compelling, and the acting is good. On the DVD there are some interesting extras for fans, as there usually are. If you are already a Burroughs fan, you need to see this movie and probably will want to own it. If you have never encountered John Carter, Tars Tarkas, Woola, or the incomparable Dejah Thoris before now, SEE THIS MOVIE! You will then want to read the original books, easily available in many formats nowadays, including free downloads for Kindle. Don't miss out on this film just because of the terrible job of marketing and promotion Disney did for it -- it's not the fault of the movie itself that it flopped, only of the lack of an adequate selling job by Disney.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like being able to access notes on my PC's, Kindle, and phone (Android).  I also like being able to attach/include/share pictures and other attachments.
B004AQR29C|4.0|good and had lots of action. had many big name stars and enjoyed it. I haven't seen the second one, but am sure it is something like the first
B00A8MGIZG|1.0|It his film is awful , I couldn't complete it. I thought that it was suitable for watching at home with my family , thank god I saw it before the others. It was a huge mistake from my side to buy it.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Good action and special affects. Somewhat of a surprise story line. Good overall futuristic plot.  Tom cruise does a good job playing his part - not over the top or a super hero but pretty believable.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Yes , but not what I expected it . I waited for the assassination scene but they got over it.
B002RXZF6C|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid. They don't make scary movies like they used to. You didn't see a lot of gorey, slasher kind of stuff back then. I prefer scary without all the gross stuff. This movie is a classic!
B00BRH2MN8|3.0|After hearing that a 16-year old was responsible for &#34;Royals&#34;, I bought this EP to sample some of her other work. It's quite interesting, and I love the originality. However, I find myself going back to this EP for only &#34;Royals&#34; and &#34;The Love Club&#34;.  It will be fun to see how she develops musically.  Girl's got mad skills!
B002BWP49C|5.0|Robert is very easy on the eyes they all were.  will enjoy it may more times.  it is a great love story
B009FZHYKU|5.0|U meet so many new people and see some go. It was exciting had me on edge of my seat.  I had to watch all the them back to back
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Robert is very easy on the eyes they all were.  will enjoy it may more times.  it is a great love story
B00015BIOQ|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the three most perfectly recorded albums in my 3,500 CD collection. Not only is Chris Jones represented here in a mature, deep and consistent sonic environment, but the detail within the recording is absolutely state of the art. I've never been able to listen to something as many times over as this album, and for those with a beautiful audiophile sound system, the payback is evident.<br /><br />Recommended 100% for anyone who loves blues artistry!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I rated it for the three free gems, this game is addictive and now I'm just trying to fill the minimum
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I really enjoyed this &#34;game&#34;.  It really gets your mind working on a strategic level.  I haven't checked out the other factoryballs yet, I hope they include different shapes.
B00A27X972|4.0|A good read. and a different view of our species and our quirks.  Like all good sci-fi parts could really be factual.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Good game. Makes you think. Not as easy as you first think it will be. I would recommend. This game<br />To friends.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I've pretty much enjoyed all this author's books.  It's a bit frothy, not very serious,<br />but a lot of fun.
B003NHRGSQ|3.0|This book is not as good as the first one because is was predictable and a little slow. With the fist one I couldn't put it down.<br />I would recommend this series to pre teens and teens...<br />This story would be a great movie not just for pre teens and teens but for adults as well.<br />In my opinion this book was written really well and is a very good read and I recommend it to most people even if they are not readers. Also I would rate the first book a 5 stars because its such a great story
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My 5 year old is obsessed with My Little Pony Its fun, educational and at her level with room to grow. Definate reccomend.

B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. It is very clearly laid out and gives levels of  difficulty. Got into it immediately. very pleasing format and would recommend to any sudoku fans.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I loved all the music in this soundtrack.  The composer of the music knew exactly the time period and how it should mesh with the movie.  I highly recommend this soundtrack.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|I have always liked CCR's music. This album is the best of the best. I would recommend it to any one who is a CCR fan.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|This is a totally unique CD with cello.  I love how they have taken music of today and played it with 2 cellos.  It is an outstanding CD and I would highly recommend this to anyone who loves the cello.
B004H7V6C8|5.0|My three year old son is obsessed with Star Wars and I thought these mini lightsabers would be a fun little toy/science project.  They were a hit!  He thought it was pretty cool to build a light saber like the one Luke uses.
B002LANLDK|5.0|I love this movie I have all but one, the Tokoyo drift , not a big fan of that one, but the others are sooo awesome
159315724X|5.0|Great and simple book but very inspirational and helpful. will change your habits and your outlook on your life - very small changes = huge long-term results.  so glad I bought this!!

B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much better than 100 floors.  I could play it all day.  I can't wait for more levels to come out.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Read the book first, otherwise you miss out on the complex relationship between the characters and the political situation in Panem.
B009DCOU9S|1.0|I did like all the artwork and thought I could follow directions to play?!<br /><br />Even though I did try to follow what they were asking for, nothing seemed to complete their request, so I got rid of the impossible to play game....
B001TCHDPS|4.0|Raw and powerful. Rodriguez has that special something and its a refreshing voice to rediscover. No matter how long he has been in the wilderness away from public admiration, now is definitely his time. Vote for Sixto Rodriguez for mayor.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This app lets you create your own town and enjoy quests lead by Spike. It shows the elements of harmony witch will help kids learn to be nice.
1451695195|5.0|This recount of one mans perceptions of his profound experience of soul reconnection is inspirational. Rarely has there been such detailed and revealing narrative about the existence of the soul. Thanks go to the good doctor for sharing this with us.
B009C7JS14|4.0|A nice handy app. Seems to do the same as the weather channel with arguably a little smoother.interface.I like it.
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|Avery Brook's bold characterization of Captain Sisko is mesmyrising and quite enjoyable to watch. I highly recommend this entire series.
0811870413|1.0|The description for this book states that the author has \\"two decades of apprenticeship with the finest artisan bakers in France and the United States\\", which is belied by the author's own words on the very first page of the book:<br /><br />\\"I opened my first bakery nearly 15 years ago after 3 years of apprenticeship\\"<br /><br />The author then launches into a long rambling account of how he learned to bake over time while taking surfing lessons from his \\"apprentice\\".<br /><br />Possibly the author's bread is the most wondermous in the world.  It doesn't look very appetizing to me - every crust in the book appears to be burnt, a quality that some people seem to think is a hallmark of so-called \\"artisan loaves\\" and which they assiduously attempt to recreate in their home ovens.<br /><br />I don't know that they are actually burnt but they surely do appear to be; perhaps its a side effect of his \\"black oven\\", in which case they aren't actually burnt, merely sooty.  Still doesn't strike me as very appetizing.  However, to each their own.<br /><br />My problem with the book is that it so poorly presents the actual baking information.<br /><br />If you're looking for a biographical book presented as a travelogue, perhaps this is for you.  However, if you want to learn to bake bread, I don't know, if you're willing to dig through the inania, perhaps this book is STILL for you; it certainly wasn't for me.<br /><br />I don't care about the author's biography.  I don't care about his personal log of his journey through life.  Having to read through it lest I miss the actual baking content only made me care even less.  It wasn't interesting, only annoying.<br /><br />I'm not interested in recreating this author's type of bread.  If your goal is to exactly recreate this particular style of bread then perhaps it is worth it to dig through the personal drivel. There are several reviewers who seem to think that recreating the bread from this one small bakery IS the point of the book; if that is your goal too, then you may find this book helpful and necessary.<br /><br />However, if your goal is the broader, less limited one of learning to bake in your OWN style, this book has really nothing to offer.  The scope is too narrow, and the presentation too scattered.book; if that is your goal too, then you may find this book helpful and necessary.<br /><br />However, if your goal is the broader, less limited one of learning to bake in your OWN style, this book has really nothing to offer.

B00B5HQKNI|1.0|It was very slow  movie ,and the only action was at the last twenty minutes of the movie.<br />Terrible movie
B001UGB1X8|3.0|Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman seem like a good pair to make a quality movie, but the<br />story just doesn't carry so well. It is also kind of slow in development.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I've joined the many addicted to Downton Abbey. Riveting plots, fabulous characters and superb actors. The best mini series on TV in years. So glad I can watch it through Amazon Prime!!!!
0312117337|5.0|I first picked up this deck from a bookstore when I was 14 -- I was intrigued, but brought up in a very religious family and my parents would have been worried had they known I even stopped to tie my shoelaces in front of the New Age section in the bookstore.  Nevertheless, I purchased them and have never once regretted that decision.  These cards have been the source of my spiritual growth, and my guide in many times of need from adolescence into adulthood.  Spiritual guides and metaphysical discussion were very rare in my small town growing up, but these cards have shown me that the answers I seek are already inside of me.  They always offer the most beneficial and positive insight into any situation where I need guidance.  They have baffled many a skeptic with these readings as well.  Even if you don't 'believe' in tarot -- the cards are an excellent source for sound advice.  I own other decks and have tried to read from them, but nothing compares to me personally like the Osho Zen deck.  If you are considering buying these cards, you can try them on the osho.com website =click Zen Tarot for a free online reading.  Should you find these cards to be as wise as I do, I strongly recommend buying the deck as nothing beats owning a tangible deck, having the book, and being able to view the beautiful illustrations in greater detail.
B005U9REU0|5.0|There aren't many musicals i enjoy but this one is just a great time, the story is heartfelt and has a lot of real life metaphors for growing up. The soundtrack is also killer and catchy. This is one I'll be picking up the Blu-ray for.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Best update to Ridley Scott's masterpiece. Picture and audio quality is amazing, you could hear rain drops from rear speakers. Dark contrast is very deep black, shows up in many dark scenes throughout the film. This is the bluray edition to get for your collection.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded this game for my grandson and every time we tried to play the game it just continued to say it was<br />Ioading
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Movie was great, book was better, but aren't they always. Still, it was worth the price, no question about it.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|For every Depeche Mode album I buy, I need time to get used to it and like it. It has been very hard getting used to this one. I am a big fan of the poetic and abstract lyrics they produced during their glory days. Now, the lyrics can be so banal that I can't listen to them. The music doesn't recover where the lyrics fail either. Thus, on both fronts I find the album to be bland. I am sure there are some songs that I will like --as time goes by-- as was the case with \\"John the Revelator\\", but I think it's time to accept that we will never experience the same Depeche Mode from the 90's. That's life.
B005UG542S|5.0|The movie was great, the book was better, but aren't they always. Still, definently worth the price, no question about it.
B0002O7XW2|5.0|Christine (a beautiful two-tone 1958 Plymouth Fury) is much more than just a car, she  is a jealous woman, who both physically and emotionally takes possession of her owner-lover Arnie Cunningham (played by Keith Gordon).  Anyone who threatens their love, faces Christine's deadly wrath...as is made very clear in the scenes between Arnie and his girl fiend Leigh (played by Alexandra Paul) and the young punks who deface her (Christine's) beauty.  As the movie starts out and gradually progresses along, please notice the change in attitude and actions of Arnie...and the use of  varying shades of makeup, which enhances that look of possession Christine has over him.  Keith Gordon; Alexandra Paul; John Stockwell, and others starring in this movie, do a fine and convincing job of acting in their respective roles.  A must see John Carpenter film...and notice the music, which is reminiscent of other Carpenter Films such as Escape from New York and Halloween!
B001UV4XHY|5.0|The movie was great, book was better, but aren't they always. Still, it was worth the price, no question about it.

B0047Y17P2|4.0|Good story.  Kept me interested from start to finish.  Mickey Haller is a great lawyer on either side of the table.
B000TEVJYS|5.0|They don't make music like this anymore, perfect album. Massive Attack are definitely gods and anyone looking for different innovated tunes- this is it!
B002NXSRX4|1.0|Why I bought this movie to begin with is beyond me.  I watched about 45 min and shut it off....I guess I'm just getting old ( 58 at the time ).  I just rented part two from Netflix,  notice I said rented....it was much better for whatever reason, still pretty stupid but watchable. I'm not saying it might not be enjoyable to some but for me, I'd rather watch Zero Dark Thirty again.
0316017922|5.0|It explains a lot about success in this world of ours. When you are born makes a huge difference in your life.
B0041SGYVQ|5.0|This miniseries is well crafted, with balanced dosing of levity and gravity so as to enrich and refresh the viewer.<br /><br />The story accomplishes what few stories do: it explores the imperfections of the main character without adopting a cynical view or forsaking highlighting the needed principles which will elevate and enrich their life.  The story makes sure that both flawed notions and noble understandings are present and realistically included.  The characters are well rounded and appealing, being imperfect but not intolerable, and most in fact admirable.  Such a hopeful narrative brings delight to anyone who pursues valuable qualities such as graciousness, consideration, and human dignity.<br /><br />I could only wish that there were more stories of this type, and told with such understanding.<br /><br />The actors, costumes, and sets are likewise thoroughly enjoyable.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am so sad when the season ends, but look so forward to the next.  It is wonderful to be able to connect with all of the characters.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Although the subject is serious, the author presents it in a fun way that makes it easy to follow.  The exercises - or experiments - are great and should be worked on.  If you don't you're missing too much.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I have used this calculator for school because this was free and I didn't have to buy it. I used this on some math homework and it was amazing! I got all of my answers right! And it improved my grade. The only problem for me is how it does not fill the whole screen.<br />This is a great app and I very strongly recommend it.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|As a drama, this is fun to watch. Henry VIII was, after all, an enormously colorful figure. Enough so, one could well believe, that a TV series about his life that actually was historically accurate would be fanciful enough to hold people's interest. That was not the assumption in making this series. The age relationships between the characters are deceptively misrepresented by the age relationships of the actors/actresses portraying them. Actions that could not possibly have occurred are introduced, historic characters are combined into a single character for the sake of &#34;simplicity,&#34; and the whole tone of the story is given a soap opera ethos. If you know your history and do not rely on this series for authenticity, then view it as fanciful story-telling full of drama and human frailty.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was definitely a page turner and I will continue to follow the series. It is a great story line the author has created. I have read some reviews that pointed out how descriptive the writer can be and while I do agree that he is I didn't find that to a &#34;put off.&#34;
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|This was an almost perfect gem of a film.  All of the actors were superb.  Working fantasy into reality couldn't have been smoother and of course the writing and direction was perfection.<br /><br />It's my cheer-up film for my &#34;down&#34; days.  Many thanks to Woody Allen, who's  work has never been better.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Have been looking and wanting to buy this movie for a long time.  Came super fast and as always was happy with product.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|This was a really engaging, beautifully written book offering a unique perspective on race in America as seen through the eyes of a Non-American Black woman from Nigeria.i loved it .  Adichie is a gifted writer.
B000002UXZ|4.0|Loved the album makes me think what would have happened if he had joined up with george clinton later on down the line.
B006LSZECO|4.0|The author writes very well, keeps the reader wanting to continue.  However, I personally would have enjoyed<br />a different ending.  Perhaps a sequel is in the works.
B006TVQU6C|2.0|Yea, cheap, but just cheap quality. Too thin and not enough space to organize cables at back. I not vote it.
B003U80I5G|1.0|It is a good movie but in very poor quality. The price should have triggered its poor condition - it was no remastered version.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|I like his Harry Bosh books.<br />I just found out who was Harry's father was in the Lincoln Lawyer and had developed more empathy for him.  This book is about his lone man quest to the sources of illegal drugs in the shadowlands back and forth across the U.S boarder.  Sometimes I got bogged down by the quest.  I'd recommend it to Harry Bosh fans.
0307950654|5.0|am almost done and think this has been well written even though Jane Austen didn't want anyone to pen after her<br />own works.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had suspicions, but I really did not see the ending coming.  Orson Scott Card certainly knows how to tell a story.
B0001CCXZW|3.0|the only thing is that when I opened the both dvd sets the discs fell from there circle that is supposed to hold them and then two and three of the plastic disc holders fell off the back of the book, so quality of packaging totally sucked
B003H4I4JU|5.0|More powerful than &#34;Ender's Game&#34;!<br /><br />Well written and very much character driven, even though many of the characters are not human.  I especially like Jane.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antebellum could never disappoint me, I love love love their music and have seen them in concert and hope to soon again
B00B89LZ4C|3.0|This is false advertising if this is listed as an action figure. This is a statue with removable sunglasses and hat.<br />No moving parts. The gun is molded in his hand and the bag of money usually cause the figure to tip over when holding it. That being said...<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Breaking Bad and I'm still happy to own it, but very disappointed in MEZCO since they made some decent 4inch Hellboy action figures in the past.
B002QH2NUA|1.0|This was perhaps Paul's most celebrated concert, mixing his work from three decades. It is a travesty that both collections I ordered included a disc that could not be played. Very disappointed with the quality of this product.
B003CFBQBW|3.0|My wife ordered this so not much to comment on. It had good sound quality . Played as it should and helped fill her twilght saga collection.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|While it is sometimes difficult to follow due to the intertwining both with characters and time, this is a very well written book written by an incredible story teller.  I always learn something from Hosseini's books.
B002RXHW6S|2.0|was wanting a jumpy house but this one was available not easy to use, no pump, no patch kit included
B0091WNK8M|5.0|This movie takes you back to the 1980s at its best. It's no ET but the goonies was a fun movie then and now.
B00190N4E4|5.0|I watched this movie over a decade ago at the behest of my doting parents, and I didn't get it then. But now, as a penance for my childhood impertinence I decided that my atonement should be the publicly humiliating spectacle of me telling everyone my mom and pop were awesomely right, and all that is left for me to say is: Watch This Movie!<br /><br />Now, in my college years, I have made multiple studies of this period in Indian history to understand the disparities of caste, the unbelievable story of Indian independence and everything else about the colonial history of my adopted homeland. Over the course of this period of my life I have clearly come to figures like Chandrashekhar Bose, Babahseb Bhimrao Ambedkar, Tagore, and of course the unavoidable figure of Gandhi. This film is not accurate, for no film is, but rather if we take the point of view that all films are polemical pedestals, this is the one that eliminates every other possibility by its sheer fitting majesty of narration.<br /><br />When you watch this film, know this: that not all the facts are presented. The preamble, like a Star Wars film, is fitting in that it capitulates to this idea that no life will ever be told in a non-ideological and non-summative way, but this last truly epic film, shot with not one CGI effect that simultaneously illustrates the sheer love and admiration that the life of Gandhi inspires in all of our lives, allows us to understand the aspirations of everysingle on of the extras who stood, walked and cheered in the homogenized blobs of the crowds that are as characteristic of India at that time as the portrayal that the great Sir Ben Kingsley manages to pull off.<br /><br />that is all I have to say, Thanks
B00742GBDM|1.0|If you've never read the book I'm sure the movie would delight.  Unfortunately, if you love to read Jane Austen and Mansfield Park this movie misses the mark in a big way.  So disappointing.
1476733953|5.0|Best book I have read in years.  The type that you stay up late into the morning to read.  I also read the shift series which was good but not as engrossing as Wool.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show. .... addicting..... We make it a family night show and watch multiple episodes.  highly recommended hope you enjoyed too.
B00AYLTMMM|2.0|I found the relationship between the main characters (the therapist and the client) not believable as she was not professional and broke pretty much every rule of her profession.  John Hawkes, the star, was outstanding and so was the costar who plays his priest and friend.  This movie runs very very slow.  The sex scenes are not objectionable or actually very sexual.
1609611543|5.0|My overweight but thoughtful brother-in-law sent me Wheat Belly by Dr. Davis after discovering the success he is experiencing in losing weight following Dr. Davis's premise of eliminating wheat from his diet. I am not overweight but am Type I diabetic. Some medical folks would classify me as having Diabetes Type 1.5 as I succumbed to the disease at age 54! I have been insulin dependent for the past 4 years. As Dr. Davis describes in Wheat Belly, my well-meaning diabetic nurse educator provided me with the ADA recommendations for eating. Yes, the ADA does recommend reduced carb intake for diabetics but not wheat and gluten elimination. My glucose levels were like a yo-yo. Most diabetics know it's a daily battle to get within acceptable blood sugar range. So after having skimmed the first part of Wheat Belly a couple of months ago---just enough to be gracious to my brother-in-law and thank him for the gift---I pooh-poohed the whole notion of giving up bread or pastries or cereal, needless to say ALL wheat! After all, couldn't I just take a shot of insulin before (or after)I imbibed on a donut? Also, hadn't I cut back on a lot of bread/carb products being a conscientious PWD (person with diabetes)? As I picked up Wheat Belly to pass it along to someone who might benefit from it (surely I couldn't go wheat free!), I glanced through the book one last time and my eye was drawn to Chapter 7: Diabetes Nation: Wheat and Insulin Resistance. Although Type II diabetes is just about the total opposite of Type I (insulin resistance vs. NO insulin production), I decided to read through the chapter to see if I could glean any thing applicable to my situation. I found myself hours later engrossed in the entire book! Long story a little longer, I decided it might be worth a shot to try to eliminate wheat and gluten from my diet in an effort to control those terrible blood sugar highs that had been popping up when I test my glucose. The very first day of following a wheat-free eatingregime, my sugars were consistently within the normal range! Very nice, I thought. But would I feel like I was starving or deprived after a few days of this wheat-free 'experiment'? It has been several days now since I have been wheat-free.  I've never felt better! My sugars have startled me because they have been so stable! In addition, I've significantly reduced the amount of insulin I must take before a meal. Perhaps most people with Type I diabetes are smarter than I am in managing their blood sugar, but I would encourage anyone with Type I who struggles (yes, present-tense 'struggles' because battles can be won but the war still rages on) as I do to shift their paradigm as I am doing and go wheat-free.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Great read that may be a bit too disturbing to watch due to the violence, both self inflicted and serial killer.  And, then there is the tie in of the family business with as well the pork industry.
B003U6BE8I|3.0|While they say they enjoyed it, I think this movie was just a bit too scary for our 6 and 8 year old.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Many twists and turns in this book.  Hard to root for one team at the beginning but, choices are made and alliances are formed.  Didn't like the ending but, my team didn't win.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|Shows random passwords that are full of lies tried different wifi networks all lies don't beehive the 5 stars liers
B0027MJU00|2.0|Wasn't instantly taken with the characters as I was with Ms. Flynn's other 2 novels.  Her writing style was fine.  I just was not invested in the story.
0385349947|5.0|My daughter recommended this book and I have to say it was really worth reading.  An easy read with some interesting views. My daughter and I discussed it which was nice because we both grow up in totally different times
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Its MI - so one has to suspend disbelief when watching this. The stunts are great obviously, and the cast did a good job. With the theme of a megalomaniac out to destroy the world with a nuclear war I was reminded of the old Bond movies...
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This is the story of what parents would do as a last resort to save their dying child.But the daughters illness is also tearing the family apart, there 3 children 2 daughters and a son. Anna was conceived to be a an exact genetic donor for her sister who is dying of cancer . Jesse the son is ignored by the parents to busy caring for the dying Kate becomes a firebug.Anna fights to become medically emancipated from the procedures done to  her prolong Kate's life.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I got the series after much raving throughout the media on how you &#34;cant get enough&#34; of it.... oh how true!! I cant wait for next season to start...you will stay up all night wanting to see what happends next.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|faster than tetrus  I need to download it on laptop.<br /><br />I believe it would be fun on full screens maybe 3D
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is very interactive and realistic. Better than any other horse game I've ever played. You have a lot of responsibilities like a real horse owner, and you can do competeions.
B00513DGIO|5.0|The one-star review of faux-libertarians and neo-conservatives are enough to make this required reading for anyone who wants to understand the origin of debt and of currency itself and the role it has played throughout history.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|♥♥♥♥♥♥♥LOVEEE IT SO MUCH!!!!!♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥<br />came in super fast and well packaged! you will not be disappointed! and &#34;undercover&#34; so no one really knows its a camera bag to steal..highly recommended!
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|Train never disappoints.  A very good cd from stay to finish.  I have two other cds of theres and I probably like this one the best.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|The good news is that this movie is better than the first Joe movie. The Rock and Bruce are good. I am a fan of action movies, but this is another generic action movie with the GI Joe name attached to it. It's good for a little entertainment.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|You can get addictive to this game very fast, as it is a lot of fun. I find it very very entertaining.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone that is using the Kindle Fire HD.  We have four of them and doesn't work at all.  You will be wasting your time.
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This game it great. My son is entertained for hours. I highly recommend it for kids 6-10. The fun never stops!
B00B7Y0206|1.0|It doesn't work right on the Kindle Fire HD.  I deleted it immediately.  Don't waste your time to download the app.
B005HSL626|4.0|Fun for me and my two kids....it is challenging and my kids like playing head to head when we are on road trips or plane rides.
B000YABS8E|5.0|Fast moving, great actors.  The story line is far fetched in today's world. I was born in the era where there was this<br />fear of an atomic bombs. Lot of people had bomb shelter's. The 35 years in a bomb shelter is a little far out  but the whole movie shows how time catches up to the parents and a son that has never been above ground.
B00846TRHY|5.0|This story is told in a very straightforward manner, and both beautiful and brutal throughout. The most interesting aspect of this film is the question posed by the real Sam at the end, during the credits.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game....it is not super hard, but takes some skill. It is fun moving objects, opening curtains and drawers, finding keys.
0385349947|5.0|This is a must read for all women in business! Thanks Sheryl for informing women in business of the struggles and movement in supporting other women in business..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app and would like to recommend it to anyone. It works as it should. And it comes in handy in a  when ever and where ever you need it.
B00E8B1P9M|2.0|This is way worse than then first. Do not waste your time for a nonsense story. The writers were trying to achieve something, but missed the mark badly.
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|I got this game just to see what's up cause I had the other star girl. Well it's the same DAMN thing! If you don't have the rock store on your other one just update it and you will. So saying that this game merged with the other one and made me start over on the other one!!!! All my saved things are gone! I went to &quot;sinc&quot; the progress and nothing!! I ended up deleting them both. Don't let the same thing happen to you! That's why I'm writing this!
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|I like all the die hard movies and this one did not disappoint. The addition of a son was a good touch.
B003Z0BWRM|5.0|I went into reading this book with slight apprehension after reading the reviews.  I am very happy to say that I was surprised by this book.  There are a few errors with incorrect character names and a few editing issues, but overall I really enjoyed the book. I would also like to point out that I don't think the Jace character is rude or cruel. I think the story explains his attitude towards Clary. I have purchased the other books purely based on this book.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This is a fun game but seems to take up a lot of my time. It is addictive though all part of it.<br />Thanks

859037985X|5.0|I'm an advocate of learning many programming languages, and this book has done the trick for me in regards to Lua. It's hard to beat learning from the Author of a language, and Roberto does a great job of explaining everything and using tables to really bring out the power and simplicity of Lua.<br /><br />The only change that I would suggest/look forward to would be having the solutions to the quizzes in the back. Some of them were really stumpers and I couldn't get past them!

B00594XOZU|4.0|Great,fast,reliable app but one some things need to be improved- 1.Needs to have the option to save messages 2.Needs a update for kindle fire hd----- ideas-1.wouldn't be cool if the had like a built-in stranger chat like omegle or something like that so u can find strangers!! 2. They should make another app were you can video chat instead of texting but make it the same just not texting and call it Kik-Video chat make it cost a $1 or 2 to get a lil money for your hard work---- thanks kik is xboxlivemlg Xbox live gt is xxkillinxproxx
B00BKBCM4A|5.0|Good album.  If you like new trend in music you will like this album.  Not too over the top Just a good new sound.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game it keeps me thinking and it is not boring at all!! It's a true challenge. I say try it.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It's a true keeper!  Saw it on Netflix first and I don't often buy movies.  Not one to watch movies over and over.  This one would be worth it.  I was blown away.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|Much better than a lot of fantasy being churned out nowadays. Reminds me a bit of Robin Hobb's Assassin series.
B00E8B1358|2.0|Not really as good as the original movie. At lot of the action feels forced and while I did not expect much of a story, what was there feels like someone just inserted things just to give the illusion of effort for a narrative. A real disappoint for what could have been a great sequel.
B006LSZECO|2.0|None of the characters were sympathetic.  The story line was obvious.  The reader knew exactly where the author would be leading one.  Some observations about married life were spot on but nothing new.<br />I do not understand why this book was so well reviewed and why it is on the NYTimes best seller list for weeks on end.
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|Love Paul Anka and have seen him in person. My only issue with the CD is that I wish the music selection was a bit better and faster paced.
B009LDD4V4|5.0|Season 8 was terrific, proving that you can put the couple together and still have good stories. All you need is great writing and great acting. Kudos to Hanson and Nathan for the former and the cast for the latter.<br /><br />Furthermore, I think that Patriot in Purgatory and Ghost in the Machine are two of their best episodes ever, maybe even the two best. Patriot in Purgatory was very moving and gave us a chance to see how 9-11 affected both Bones and Booth. Ghost in the Machine (the one that was filmed from the victim's perspective) was eerie, but incredibly moving for both the characters and the audience. Both episodes had me in tears.<br /><br />As always, there were gooey gross bodies, perplexing mysteries, amazing science, Hodgins' crazy fun \\"experiments,\\" grumpy but lovable Caroline Julian, a massively creepy serial killer, humor, witty dialogue, Booth and Bones' deepening relationship, and Brennan's continuing evolution. Two of my all-time favorite quotes are from this season. Bones described the perfect vacation spot to Booth as paradise with \\"mass graves for me and a beach with liquor for you.\\" Also, when Sweets' new roommates mistook Bones and Booth for Sweets' parents, one of the roommates tells Sweets that \\"his dad is hot.\\"<br /><br />Those are only the most notable moments to me. There were many, many more.<br /><br />Can't wait for Season 9. Only 5 weeks to go.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Have seen Michael in person and this CD is excellent. He is a first class entertainer and the CD is top rate.
B0089Q1TPM|5.0|Blazing Saddles went over very well with my 7 year old nephew, and he hasn't seen any cowboy movies. Of course he loved the bean scene and when Mongo slugs the horse, but he also loved the French Mystique dance number.<br /><br />He has seen Stars Wars, so I thought he might relate to this better. Also, I've been telling him for years that he looked like Dark Helmet when he was first learning to skate (at 3 years old). He had this enormous black helmet that seemed to be half as big as he is. I figured might enjoy this. He definitely did.<br /><br />Of course, it's fun for me to have the excuse to watch these wonderful movies again -- and again and again and again. It's great when a grown up has a chance to act like a kid.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is so fun... you never want to run out of coins so you can keep playing! I like how the monotony of just dropping coins is broken up by special coins and prizes. also after you get one of each color prize it helps you in game. The game keeps you entertained for hours.
B006S01GH2|5.0|I have evolved into being attracted to feel good movies, but only when they have a plot and enough of a script and acting talent to hold your interest. And Miss Tautou is fascinating
B002LFPAUC|5.0|The remastered collection is fantastic, Cleese and the whole group are extremely funny, and the picture quality and sound are much better than the original shows.<br />Higly recomend these videos.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Well-written, dark & full of authentic dialogue, HOC is as addictive as southern BBQ. Cannot get enough! Can't wait for next season.
B008IJT0CE|3.0|I love the app... when it works correctly. On multiple occasions, while listening to sounds and using my web browser, it just tapers off all on it's own. I've reported it, and hopefully will be fixed soon.
1439156816|5.0|This book is a joy to read.  It is more than the title implies because it is a memoir that also shares ideas and tricks of the trade to help others on their way to storytelling.  It's both heartbreaking and laugh out loud funny at times,  King does not mince words but he is also compassionate and encouraging.  Whether you love to write or love to read or both, this book is for you.  You will forever view the written word with a more profound understanding.
0671646788|5.0|\\"The Magic of Thinking Big' by David Schwartz, is a classic. It should be read by anyone who wants to get ahead and make a good impression on people. In this book the author gives secrets that help people be successful in their financial life, their job, relationships, and in generally living a rewarding life. The most important prerequisite for success is to belive that you can be successful. He talks about excusitis, people making excuses and never getting ahead. He also talks about thinking big. People live stunted lives because they are afraid to step out and try something new. He talks about how to work with these fears. He discusses all the potential creative dreams that get scrapped because a person doesn't have the confidence or motivation to carry them out. What a loss to the world!<br /><br />One concept I really liked was to think of yourself as an important person. Then when you are about to make a decision on something ask  yourself \\"Would an important person do this? Would an important person dress like this? Would an important person take this or that course of action. Ask yourself the question and then follow the appropriate answer. This got me thinking about the way I dress and the impression I make on people. I must confess, my wardrobe needs an overhaul. So do many of  my negative thought procoesses.<br /><br />Attitude is really important and Dr. Schwartz discussess that. You can sit and grouse, or you can think constructively. The more  constructive positive thoughts you have the more likely you are to succeed. If  you can show your boss that you have a good attitude and think constructively and positively, you'll get ahead faster.<br /><br />I liked his chapter on goals. People don't get anywhere without goals. You can't just have a foggy impression of what you want. Clarity, and motivation are really important in reaching those goals. Setting deadlines helps a lot and don't get all bent out of shape if you miss a deadline, set another deadline. Life is unpredictable and things do come up.<br /><br />I picked up a lot of ideas from this book that are going to be very useful to me. I bet they would beuseful to other readers too. Anyone who wants to make good impressions and get ahead should consider this must reading. -- Valerie Lull, Author, Ten Healthy Teas.

B002HSSAY6|3.0|This was an interesting look at the way movies have changed.  As our son stated: if something is not blowing up every 15 minutes or so, he's not interested. This movie had many, many, MANY long glances full of emotion and meaning.  Too many, really, for my taste now, but worth watching if you want to relive the olden days.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was a nice book to read! I found it relaxing and interesting. It was emotional at times but I enjoyed that. The characters were excellent.<br /><br />As an adult it's odd to look back at high school and all of the different people. I thought it was all so true and sometimes sad how hard kids are on each other. This would be a great book to have kids read before they go to high school so they can really think before they are mean.<br /><br />This was an excellent book and I will most likely read it again after I have read some other books. It's very touching.
B005COO1X6|3.0|The ending was a little abrupt. I really enjoyed the story line and was happy that there were not too many characters names to keep up with.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was so much different than what I would normally read. It was great insight as to what others lives are like. I found myself drawn into the book quickly and enjoyed reading it. I purchased this book becasue I have heard ther is a movie out now and I wanted to read the book first. At this point I loved the story so much im not sure I want to watch the movie and ruin how I pictured the characters and differnt takes on things.<br /><br />overall great book. Something different and enjoyable to read.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|There are not enough instructions for this game.  It is not like the Uno I played as a kid.  I wish I could get my money back.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I thought this book was good but I won't read it again. It was interesting to read about so many different cultures in one book. That aspect of the book was enjoyable but sometimes I felt like I was reading about too many different families at once. Overall it's a good book and a nice read as far as the culture and family ties goes.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|G.I. Joe Retaliation features a lot of predictable to unrealistic scenes and action. Nevertheless, it is fast paced and entertaining. If you like Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Bruce Willis, you'll like enjoy this movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a great app<br />I have used it every day on my Kindle Fire and will download for my Iphone tonight<br />Great way to kill a little time.<br />I can't believe it is free
1609611543|4.0|The book's excerpts and summaries tend to adequately communicate the main message of this book: \\"the wheat of biblical times and of our forefathers no longer exists.\\" Even more disturbing, all wheat (even whole grain products) can either kill you or leave you wanting to kill yourself. Scary. Don't read this book if you are not to the point where you are willing to do what is needed to loose weight, eliminate much of your belly, and/or fight chronic diseases like arthritis, diabetes, and even psoriasis.<br /><br />I'm about three months into eliminating wheat from my diet - I started down this path because such action was recommended by one of my doctors who is helping me combat arthritis, psoriasis, and severe disc degeneration (associated with a broken vertebrae and following  three major back surgeries). Wheat Belly helped me make a commitment to do the best job I can of getting wheat out of my diet. The results? So far, I'm fairly certain it has helped me keep psoriasis in remission and it has lessened the impact of arthritis on my joints. I'm positive it has helped me control my appetite and begin to lose the last few pounds that need trimmed away. Time will tell if it really works and if I can stick to it. Regardless, at this point it seems worth the effort.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|So let me start by saying I cannot get the image of Tommy Scio in his tighty-whiteys air guitaring his way through that dreadful scene in that dreadful movie that made all the girls think he was a normal heterosexual boy in the years before he became Supreme Overlord of Lord Xenu's cabal.<br /><br />Having said that, this movie was like a successful meal.  I sat down hungry, no, I was Jonesing, for some sci-fi and decided to hold my nose during the scenes showing him as an action hero but as course after course was delivered by Morgan Freeman my hunger was sated and at the end I belched, pushed back from the table and felt satisfied.<br /><br />The film is visually stunning, the action moves the story along, has some nice  nods to stories past (Drowned World, Day After Tomorrow, Independence Day and Planet of the Apes) it keeps the plot simple and moving forward efficiently and we learn the truth along with Tommy boy.  All in all money well spent.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you're an alien fan than this is exactly the collection you want. All the movies on blu ray with a ton of behind the scenes. I think the only thing that would have made it better would be if the boxing was like the dvd quadrilogy set.

B0081336FO|3.0|The actors were fine.  Maybe because I have been a Sherlock fan so long the modern setting just doesn't work for me.  For a new admirer of these mysteries they will be very enjoyable and maybe that's a good idea.  I just hope they go back and read the original books.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Though this game claims to be like Tetris, I think it is only marginally similar.  Instead of rotating and moving, you just slide pieces.  It's pretty challenging, you have to figure out the strategy for filling rows to avoid stacking. <br /><br />I used Zen mode and infinite mode, and they both worked well.  One one-star review said the game didn't download properly, but it worked fine on my Fire HD.  I liked the game.  Four stars, at least.  Maybe five stars, I need to play some more....

B0050DIWFC|4.0|This story seemed like it could happen to you.  Anyone who has raised a child knows that sometimes it's hard to believe them. Should you believe (in) them now?  Even though everything is stacked against them?  The courtroom drama unfolds at the same time the trust level for the main character's child goes on a roller-coaster ride.  The book ends in a most shocking and unexpected way that leaves you staring at the wall and just saying &#34;Whoa&#34;.
B00BBIAB0Y|4.0|I have mixed feelings about HotQ 2nd Edition.  On the one hand, HotQ is a good story (although Dave has grown as a writer since he wrote it).  On the other hand I already have the first edition in e- and tree-formats and I did not find anything in this edition that made it superior to the first edition.  On the gripping hand, if you don't already have HotQ then buy this edition (after reading _On Basilisk Station_).
B000ICXQF6|2.0|DDidn't like how the main characters (Willis & Pitt) were not 'in their element'. Both didn't seem to fit the roles, they both were over-acting. This distracted from the plot which was pretty strong.
B001NCL382|5.0|Eric is one of the reasons I learned to play the guitar. Yet with all I know and all that I've heard from other blues guitarists, Eric Clapton is one of if not the best. No one to this day can bend a note like he could.<br />Jack Bruce is another Bass player/ composer that over the years is under played in the media. His powerful vocals and driving Bass lines are awesome with adding that touch of the truly creative artistry.<br />Ginger Baker was a madman on drums. Not many know it but there was a lot of discord between Jack and Ginger in the early days. Ginger actually was fond of Jazz and you can hear that independence in a lot of live jams. I'm a novice drum myself and I can appreciate his rhythms and speed. My advice is Buy It, if you like Blues rock, this is it baby!
B004ADH1RI|5.0|Great awesome movie. My family went to Astoria where it was filmed and we loved retracing the steps from the movie.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We grew to love each character more and more.<br />The whole series is the best television ever.<br />Favourite episode is the one with &#34;Brothers in Arms&#34; sound track when The President's secretary is killed.
B001HM1PFO|5.0|Tim Curry is amazing!  Excellent soundtrack.  Total classic.  I saw this movie in the theatre in the 1980's, and have been hooked ever since.  Not for the faint of heart.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game is fun. I like the challenge of not using hints. Hidden picture scenes really clear when you zoom!!!  I would definitely play this one again!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I was blown away at the quality of acting from such young artists. This coming of age story reveals the cruel reality of the emotional trauma of sexual abuse in a very tasteful, discreet and compassionate way. Very moving story that also shows the process of healing and opening up 'is' part of the healing process.
B004529NKM|4.0|Not as good as the 1st one but better than the 2nd. The first one is my favorite because Channing Tatum is in that one.

B008HJGPVO|3.0|I'm not sure about the use of the 3 sizes. And at first, the &#34;gum&#34; was a bit too hard on the screen and I couldn't do what I wanted whereas my previous stylus didn't have that drawback. It's getting better though.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am a Walking Dead fan, but didn't get 'bitten' by the Walking Dead bug until season 3 was almost over.<br /><br />What is soooo cool about Amazon video is that you don't have to stream the video and be confined to watching the episodes when you have wi-fi available; you can download all the episodes to your device  in advance (for me, Kindle Fire HD), and then they are available and ready to view whenever you have time, no matter where you are!  I was on a business trip for a week during the time that I was catching up on these episodes but I had downloaded all the episodes before I left home so I was happily engrossed in the Walking Dead at the airport, on the plane, in my hotel room, everywhere.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is fun and i cant stop playing it. Its adicting except my 4 year little brother ten times better cthan me. I should start practicing.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Can't wait to watch Season 3! Our Prime account has always been good to us, but having the first three seasons of Downton available for free is a nice bonus. Recommend Season 2 for sure!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Dr. Alexander does a good job of describing his very unique experience with life after death.  For any one who has ever wondered what lies in store for us after death, this book may be a big help in answering those questions.  It is well worth reading, and thinking about.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|This device works as expected. I have not as of this moment streamed Netflix via the &#34;proper&#34; ways using the Android app or the &#34;Cast&#34; button on the site. I am pretty sure they will work as directed.<br /><br />Tab streaming is very good and is not choppy, unless you minimize it/move the mouse around, especially when streaming a local file to the screen. Website streaming is good, although laggy, it does the job.<br /><br />HOWEVER here is where it gets really bad: Streaming a local file REQUIRES internet to get the stream starting which is insanely stupid. Here is what I did:<br /><br />(With Internet)<br />1) Drag and Drop a video file to Chrome. Let it play.<br />2) Cast it<br />3) Disconnect internet<br /><br />It worked fine without internet. However when I stopped it and tried to stream a new file (this time a music file) it refused to work. It showed a black screen but that was it.<br /><br />I would like to see a better update to this. This is horrible.<br /><br />I will come back with updates as to if it streams a local web page without internet.<br /><br />However, if you want a simple netflix only experience, this is perfect. It goes without saying that it requires a cellphone but that is a given.

B003YVCJQ0|5.0|I mean really... implausible, unbelievable... at times even stupid.<br />But throw in Will Smith in his prime, Jeff Goldblum, and a very good supporting cast and you cant help but love this film. At least I cant. We haul it out every 4th of July.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's a really good game, and very fun. If any one was looking for a great game then here it it
630469797X|5.0|A classic! I loved this film when I saw it in theaters when it first came out, and still love it now. One of the best zombie films ever made.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|After reading some of the other salaciously generous reviews, I was surprised they were all right. &#34;Tangled&#34; is a uncouth, narrative from Drew, a vicious I-banking serial one-night stand-er, who got his world jacked off its axel by the newest, engaged, associate at his firm, Kate. His voice is unrepentant, honest, as we stumble upon him in his ultimate week long pity party trying to recover from messing things up with Kate. He retells how they met, warred at work, and ultimately fell for each other, only to let his ego get the better of him and potentially a future with Kate.<br /><br />I finished this book in a day and was snickering the whole way. Anyone familiar with the Manhattan hook up scene and the high rollers that play there, will eat this book up.
B00101ZOTA|4.0|A very enjoyable movie, but like the 6th Sense its re-playability suffers because of how it ends.  However, first time watchers are in for a treat.  The bluray transfer looks very good--not great--and the disc is a little light on special features.  That said, great story + good transfer + cheap price = buy
B0001WGDX0|5.0|I have owned this music since it was released on vinyl in the late '70's.  This was one of the last important recordings of the analogue era for Bernstein.  Indeed, when he turned to Brahms with the Wienerphilharmoniker they were recorded digitally.  This set was recorded live with brush-ups on the ends of movements to eliminate audience noise -- of which there is none.  These recordings were released simultaneously with the Beethoven-Bernstein television series on PBS.  These recordings were also some of the first major things Bernstein recorded with DGG.  So this set has a lot of firsts and lasts associated with it.<br /><br />As to the quality of the music-making, based on some things Bernstein has said about his association with the Vienna Philharmonic, not to mention the piece he wrote for the introduction of the accompanying booklet, I believe he was so excited at the prospect of recording Beethoven in Vienna with (finally) warm acceptance from the Philharmonic that he simply went over the top and did his very best work on these pieces with that orchestra.  I think he almost had a sense of legacy.  He gives the music and the venue almost hallowed respect.  The slow movements, particularly, are just gorgeous.<br /><br />In a video biography of Herbert von Karajan, Christa Ludwig was asked to contrast Karajan and Bernstein.  Very eloquently she said, \\"Karajan was a great musician and conductor, but Lenny WAS music!  Never was that oneness with the spirit of the composer and the emotion of the music more in evidence than in his complete recording of Beethoven's 9.  I'm convinced he achieved a spiritual connection to the proceedings that was unique among his recordings.  After 33 years of listening to these recordings:  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
B0017XD3OY|3.0|I LOVE Will Smith but this movie really lacked &#34;something&#34;...not sure what, but after it was done I thought &#34;really, that is how they are ending it?&#34;...
B00756GRUE|5.0|The quality of the watch and performance of the Amazon vendor was as expected; outstanding. The only thing that could me improved was make the second hand white instead of &#34;hard to see&#34; blue against a black dial. Also the date is very hard to read. But...considering the overall quality of this watch compared to other famously expensive brands, it more than holds its own.<br /><br />A great value and a very reasonable price.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love playing these kinds of games. It's so addicting. I just wished they had more levels for continuous fun.
1781162646|5.0|King can still tell a great story. Loved the story placement and the interesting characters. This guy can write a beautiful and satisfying story.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I loved this game until they added this horrendous sell-out of an M-Points thing.  Just atrocious.  What idiot would have agreed to make everybody hate their product?  Nobody likes this game now - why would you do this???
B0015DROBO|5.0|I have seen both the American and Swedish film versions and the book is by far the best of the three. Although the films are quite good. Now going to read the other two books of the trilogy.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I Hope They Created More!  Great Graphics, Great Story Line! Too!  like They Say, Turn Off Hints, It Makes The GameThat Much Better
B00CL68BK2|2.0|The movie is a routine romantic comedy, the book is so much more. They completely removed most of the key components of the plot. The book is a must read, the movie not so much.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice weather app. Would like to see humidity on daily for cast. Other than that its a well designed and thought out app
B005544TRQ|5.0|It is one of the most entertaining shows I have seen.  Smart and witty dialogue, fast paced, attractive people and settings and very interesting story lines. I especially like the character of Harvey and the guy who plays him.  Everyone on it is fantastic.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Good stuff. Challenging and fun. I hope an update comes soon. Once I got the hang of the various design factors, my creative juices were stimulated.
B0000242BH|5.0|This is an excellent disc of baroque solo viol music from Jordi Savall.  There are pieces by a variety of composers, many of whom you would expect to find in such a programme, like Marais, Sainte-Colombe and Forqueray, but there are also fine pieces by Schenck, de Machy and d'Hervelois whom I hadn't come across before.  It's a lovely, varied programme and a fascinating and beautiful listen throughout.<br /><br />In his notes Savall stresses that commentators of the time suggested that the viol these pieces should sound close to the human voice.  This leads to a freely-phrased and intimate performance which he pulls off superbly.  Savall has been one of the world's very finest gamba players for decades now and his superb technique and musicianship shine through this disc.  My only small reservation comes in the selected movements from the Bach Cello Suites where it seems to me that the rhythmic freedom means that Bach's essential pulse is a little lost, but it's a tiny niggle and a very personal one which may not bother others at all.<br /><br />The recorded sound is excellent, beautifully catching Savall's lovely viol tone (and his occasional groaning along with the music) and the presentation and notes are of Alia Vox's usual excellent, lavish standard.  I warmly recommend this disc - it's another cracker from Jordi Savall.
B008V4H6N6|2.0|I listened through the album a couple times, and it just never grew on me. I wanted to like it, but it didn't happen.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|I love the books in this series. This book boasts great characters, believable dialogue, as well as an interesting setting and good storyline.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is a great show and I found myself sad when an episode was over. But it is nice to know that even the episodes I miss can be seen here on Amazon for a decent price. Thankyou.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|I will admit that I was drawn to this book by the high number of five star reviews it received. When I sorted my search results by highest average customer reviews, this book came out on top. A few read reviews later and I purchased it for my Kindle.<br /><br />The author's writing style is smooth and easy to read. Even in the slower parts of the story, I had no problem continuing onto the next (electronic) page. The character's were fairly convincing but occasionally one-dimensional. I didn't have much trouble figuring out who the heroes and the villains of the book would be.<br /><br />And therein lies my three star rating. Even though the book was competently written and the story had an engaging idea surrounding it, I sometimes found myself wondering about the science behind the fiction in this book and occasionally had to stretch my beliefs to accept the results of a character's actions. In addition, some of the character's were a bit one-dimensional so I found it hard to start caring about them. These aren't major problems, but I do believe that a more seasoned writer may have found more convincing scenarios for the characters in the book.<br /><br />Overall, this book is worth the read. I don't think it's destined to become a sci-fi classic but I do think it's a solid addition to the genre.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is really awesome. It has really good graphics, and I do know most people don't care about that. There is a store that you can buy stuff at with money that you collect as you go along and there is another store where you can buy stuff with real money. The game can go on forever, it ends when you lose, like Temple Run. It's really fun and it can connect to Facebook. You should try it!  ~pickiejojo

B00ADQCBEY|5.0|Great writing, acting, and cinematography. Not sure why it took me so long to start watching this show, but I'm glad I did. Its up there with the best TV dramas of the last 20 years.
B0036EH40Q|5.0|Tombstome is a great movie.  If you enjoy watching Kurt Russell,<br />You will really enjoy this as He is one of the main stars.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|These guys are awesome.  I was at a very small piano venue years ago with Jon Schmidt and his talents are amazing.  Added with Steven Sharp Nelson--these guys are just plain amazing. Makes being a musician a cool profession!
B002UNMW7O|5.0|This movie was just as amazing as it's predecessor... *SPOILER* Even after the death of Rocco the twins find their third muskateer in a Mexican man named Romeo, who's uncle has his finger on the pulse of the gangster community. With Papa Joe's son out for revenge and the boys being lured back to beantown with the murder of a priest this movie is action packed and as mind blowing as the first one.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|This is a good compilation of Neil's greatest tunes. It is good from the start to the finish. I haven't heard most of these songs for years and Neil's musical expertise is extraordinary! That dude can jam! Neil can jam is an understatement! He rocks!
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Loved the movie except for the ending. How many more alian syfi movies are they going to make where the people sneek onto a little alian ship fly to the mother ship sneek on and blow it up. Sad!!!!
B009WUBERW|4.0|It is a terrific action movie. Has a lot of known A actors in it. the action keeps you locked to the screen
B007MJT13E|3.0|Low cost productions may get a hit when attention to details and good acting come over other things, like sound. Here you have a great story concept, complete with emotional flashbacks that complement the brutal violence between the characters. But some people came out in caricaturesque way, with stupid reactions and bad acting. Some action sequences missed logic or visual impact.<br /><br />I understand why it becomes a cult thing, it's a dark concept with deep cinism, and some strong characters. I think it's a good experimental movie that probably would become a bigger hit with a remake from an expert like, say, John Woo.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The app works great on my kindle...I love pinterest and visit daily.  Pinning works well too if what you are pinning has a pinterest button.
0385535147|3.0|John Grisham's latest book was quite a disappointment to me. Although well-written, the main characters were despicable scam artists whom I could not care about. There was very little legal action in the book. Please bring back characters and plots as in A Time To Kill (his best book, in my opinion). Fortunately I got the book from the public library, so wasted only my time, not my money.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this book (as well as &#34;The Story Teller.&#34;  Picoult is a gifted writer who seems to be able to delve deeply into why the characters are in certain positions in life. Great book...can't wait to start the next one on the Picoult list.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|It is a fun game even though I sometimes am not sure what I did to get some of the good scores. Is challenging and keeping me<br />trying to do bettwe.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The writer of this story has gone too far with death and hardship.  I may not watch anymore of this saga because the last episode was uncalled for and not right.  Real life has its crises but there comes a time when life grows and becomes better unless there is something terribly wrong and evil with the people involved.  This is not so with this family.<br /><br />I have enjoyed very much the whole panorama of Downton Abbey and the lives of the people.  The last episode has put the story into a Soap Opera. Have it your way but you have lost this person's support for your work.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This is the best case I've ever had for my iPhone. I would recommend it to anyone! I love the fact that its waterproof but it also protects my phone. If you're looking for a case this is the one. I also like that its not bulky like the otter box!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|It's a great way to share ideas and pictures with your family and friends, as well as getting the latest political and entertainment news.  I also enjoy using facebook to play games.
B000YJ54DU|4.0|A good read. I've read most of the Reacher books so I didn't need time to get to know everyone.  A good story giving sight to the men (and women) fighting in Iraq, Syria, Afganistan.  This  gives insight into the families who must care for those injured in this new war.  There are thing worse than death. There are those who profess to be \\"true believers\\" and lead but in what direction?<br />A little romance and a helpful  nature help Reacher  make things right on his way thew this world.<br />Judy
B00CXQL828|5.0|I can't think of anything the music business needs more today than this band.  This record is a life-changer for it's listeners and a call to action for all musicians.  The perfect marriage of musicianship, songwriting, and rock n' roll attitude. It's in nonstop rotation.  They deserve every ounce of success they've garnered so far, and a thousand times more.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|Unimpressed. I won't be keeping this app on my tablet, though. It bored me after a few swirls.<br />My 12-y/o granddaughter didn't think much of it either.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I rarely download a new sudoku as I feel that :)Sudoku is the gold standard for sudoku. This one caught my fancy and I hit the button. It is light and fun to play with nice animations. The graphics are crisp. Even the sounds are not intrusive and you can turn them off if you want to.<br /><br />Before bedtime I am not looking for a challenge but just easy entertainment, so I have just chosen the easy level. So far I cannot comment on the other levels.<br /><br />Overall an enjoyable app.<br /><br />You do not need wifi to play and you will not lose pencil marks if you hit pause before exiting.
B00C0UHGLO|3.0|It's just an ok game. Something to do when I'm bored of the other bunch of games on my tablet. It's different enough from the Jewel type games and puzzle games to keep my interest for awhile.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; a couple of months ago and the book definitely impressed me; so I decided to read some of Gillian Flynn's earlier novels.<br />What can I say....I don't profess to be the smartest lighbulb in the knife drawer.....I thought I had the endidng figured out.....but I was wrong!
B0059WTMLW|3.0|I prefer the sudoku books, I suppose. The &#34;very easy&#34; puzzles were pretty hard, and I could not figure out how to start a puzzle over again, time-wise. For some reason, it is much more relaxing to do sudoku puzzles in the magazine booklets.... I even get to the Hard puzzles in those. At least this was free.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game has fabulous graphics and is a lot of fun. It has lots of fun games to play and is all around great. Highly recommended.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|Now that accounts are available on tablets and my smart phone, I needed to be able to access accounts that are available when I am on my computer. I have used several programs that promise ease of access, but I like this one the best out of all of them for ease of use.
B007ME5BUG|4.0|At the end Beevor makes comments that are only his. Not the gal facts. His work,excluding my comment, was GREAT.  He puts together a very good history.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|This is worth seeing, good effects, good story.<br />However they missed the mark by replacing<br />some of the original character stars(would<br />have liked original stars of the 2003 Hulk, both<br />in Hulk sequel and Marvel's The Avengers), this<br />disappointed me. I suppose they must have<br />had a good reason. Still worth seeing.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|graphics and find along with cluesxare fun  like that you find items to get other items<br />saved my place in the story and finding next level was fun
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|This movie could have been perfect if it wasn't for the silly<br />alien make up on the bad aliens. Fully entertaining, acting<br />excellent, great story line. Well worth seeing.
B00821PCJS|4.0|This series is well scripted, keeping your attention from show to show.  One series you want to continue to see what happens.  You truly get involved with the actors and what is to become of them.  Highly recommend this show.  Appeals to both men and women.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Interesting movie, but kind of trippy.  Somewhat reminded me of the recent remake of Alice in Wonderland.  Franco makes for a great character in this movie.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|This is an excellent CD.  Gwyneth is great,  My favorite is Home.  Just love that.  Every song is a keeper!
B00D6BQG1W|3.0|My husband thought this movie was great - I could have gone without seeing it.  Watched on a Saturday night when we were looking for a comedy, and while this was a bit comedy it was also a bit blah.  Perhaps the title of the movie really speaks for it is - just a warm body - blah.  Not recommended by me, recommended highly by my husband.
B000ZHBB0Q|5.0|Great movie. A true classic that shows a view of what life used to be like for the young growing up in the now lost America...
0425263916|5.0|Two day reader, couldn't wait for the next in the series, passed it on to my friends so they could enjoy
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Great movie, as I expected. Leonardo Di Caprio does an excellent job portraying Hoover. Gave an enlighting look into the past, and how his life unfolded and he became so powerful.
0425263908|5.0|Second book picked up after the first and again a two day reader so glad I reviewed this series can't wait for Day's next
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|It was good with great actors.  Story line a little weak in some places, but I did like **SPOILER** Hansel having to take an injection so often because of all the candy he ate when they were prisoners of the witch (ahem...diabetes maybe).  I like the actors and they are great action stars, but I called foul on the chain gun against the witches.  However, if you suspend some belief, it is a good movie.
0385528752|5.0|Very enlightening read and extremely useful...not like any other change management book. I keep it as a desk reference. I also recommend both, Stick and Decisive by the Heath brothers.
B00E9PXI3S|1.0|So boring. The plot made no sense. And it had no ending. Just an overall bad movie!!! Do not watch!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Ready for next season to start!!  I can't wait, I am addicted to the show and even have gotten my husband liking it after he viewed the DvDs with me. 😊
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Gave them to my 21 year old son for his Birthday.<br />He has always enjoyed all the Harry Potter Films and now he has them on Blu-ray.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I find it an enjoyable pastime, when I need a quick diversion.  Provides a challenge to help keep me alert. Warning, it can be addictive.
B004JK61K0|2.0|i used the app for my LG phone and had no problem. i thought it would be the same for my Kindle.... it was not. i tried to log on to my server to get my work e-mail and gave up after a week.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|It is always revealing to read the personalized stories of Afganistan making it all very real through the eyes of the people or the women peeking from their berkas.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|Author seems to have missed a large part of history; did not mention US Ambassador to England who largely agreed with Lindbergh. Lynne Olsen was determined to paint all the negatives positive re: FDR. Hardly worth the time.<br />Marion Lavery
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book and the stories are primarily about family and relationships.  The &#34;knowing&#34; that there is a hole inside that is never filled until you discover the missing piece.
B00005UWUL|2.0|See above for the terrible quality of the disk.  I would like to return it but it would cost more than the actual order
B00DHQ208Y|5.0|It's music that'll put smiles and stuff wherever smiles are supposed to go.  This is good meaty but fun music.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I simply love how easy it is to use and how convenient it is. It makes generating passwords simple and all you need to do is have one password memorized and let LastPass to the rest.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|a senior citizen dealing with life, big business and our government comes out on top, supporting characters are good also
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I use to use Google reader and Feedly stepped up to the challenge and was able to curate all my rss feeds. I like how easy it is to use.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So glad to watch all three seasons without waiting week by week. Couldn't stop watching. Anticipation was HIGH and suspense motivating to continue WITHOUT DELAY. Sad that the 4 season isn't available. Now, it's hard to wait. I've happily captured into the life of Downton Abbey. EXCELLENT EXCELLENT EXCELLENT!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This  book was very interesting and well written. Dr. Alexander is a very intelligent, caring person who is down to earth<br />and has the same troubles that many others may experience. His NDE was written in a very different way than many<br />others and I must admit I had to go back and read it twice. It was really awesome. His medical terminology about<br />the brain was a little over my head. But again very interesting. His life story about his family, being adopted and then<br />finding his biological parents was, I think a big part of the book. His feeling of being abandon shows an other side of<br />Dr. Alexander but it also shows and tells of his love for his adopted parents and the great love he has for his siblings that<br />he grew up with. I could go on and on about this book but to get down to the NDE I do believe that after being in a coma for<br />7 days it would impossible for the brain to come back after such a disease. With this NDE, which I am sure was amazing,<br />God Bless him, his wife and two sons.  How lucky they are to have him.  I am sure this book will help others.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This program is wonderful.  I had never watched it when it was on our PBS station but I did hear people say how great it was and they were right.  It is so different from anything scheduled on our US programs.  No gore, no ugly bodies.  I love the interactions between the staff, the royals and each other and love watching the style of clothing changing as the years go by.  Can't wait for more excellent programming like this.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great doc about a legendary LA studio...Dave tells the inside story of the a special place in the music industry.  You'd be surprised at the amount of great music that came out of this place. Don't miss it.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This is a great movie to watch in 3D with all the action and flying involved. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Great movie-- Very funny. Great interactions between characters. The plot was built so accommodate the funny interactions. Set us up for RED2.
B00404YUG2|5.0|If you're sitting around on your ass doing nothing, Steven Pressfield will make you feel bad about it... in a good way. He's very astute when it comes to identifying the kinds of things we tell ourselves when we're trying to avoid doing our work. If you've ever experienced &#34;resistance&#34; (and you know you have) then this is a must-listen.
B008KYOCA2|2.0|I chose this calendar as I wanted something I could jot a brief note on any given date.  The picture looks like I should be able to do this.  This is not so.  It works as a calendar and that's about it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun i like the my little sister loves it im glad i got it now i can have some free time
B00BF11UM0|5.0|this is a must watch… great story, impeccable directing and acting. I need to write 9 more words in here.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game really is free. You don't have to buy new levels with real money. This game is so fun. I play it all the time. Get it now.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Spent 30 minutes with ONE PHOTO!!!  Merely cropped photo and saved dozens of times.  You cannot specify WHERE TO SAVE and the destination is a complete mystery. Save to Facebook appears to work but in fact does NOTHING. Uninstalling immediately!!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Please note that while I viewed the full series Rome as sent by HBO, I later followed featured actors Kevin McKidd to \\"Topsy-Turvy\\" and Ray Stevenson to \\"Punisher: War Zone.\\"  Both those films DVDs good to go througn Amazon.  Topsy-Turvy is a delight all-family viewing.  Punisher:  War Zone is another matter.  Both McKidd and Stevenson are stone good actors.  CC Williams in Michigan.
B009ZQJ0ME|5.0|A little out tere but pretty good. Great action sequences. Good storyline, in the theme of classics of 1984, Logan's run, and other movies like that.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A great book with superbly drawn characters.  The author does a great job of describing the detail of life on a Virginia plantation prior to the Civil War.  She did an especially good job portraying the hierarchy of life in the slave quarters and how the lives of the slaves were influenced by the hatred and fear they experienced on a daily basis.  I think this book would be a good young adult book.  I had a hard time putting it down.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|It has all the elements I enjoy in a movie and with great acting !<br />Must admit I like lawyer type settings.
B008Y73QDY|4.0|My son just loved this film (and so did we!).  Took a couple of its to get going, but never lost my 3 year old sons attention for the rest of the film.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|people might say this wasn't a good movie but it isn't bad either.  i enjoyed it and thought it was clever.  may not be perfectly executed, but it was original and compelling.
B000P407K4|5.0|No mater how many times i watch this Movie, it still make me Laugh, George C Scott is one of my favorite actor, Peter Sellers is great ones again in multiple roles, watching the actor trying not to laugh at Dr. Strange love (Peter Sellers) at the end is classic.
B008220BLG|5.0|All the blood and guts of traditional zombie movies is great, but every once in awhile I like a warm fuzzy movie as well and this move was awesome!
B0039OC64M|5.0|The VHS release had more music from the Eurythmics, that was removed on the digital releases, other then that is the same movie, I would love to see and up to date remake of this book , one that would give the viewer a more accorate picture of totalitarianism from the book, I'd like to see Gary Oldman as Winston Smith,  Anthony Hopkins as O'Brien maybe Kay Winslet as Julia and don't hole back on the though police.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Best all-around show in decades! Just got started on Downton Abbey after I signed up for Amazon Prime and watched 3 seasons in 6 days. In retrospect, I guess that wasn't such a good idea because now I'm going crazy waiting for season 4.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This covers everything in our lives. I really like the section of fermentation .. that is really incredible. Thank you.
B004JHYRP4|5.0|I know, Asimov wrote 440 books and I havn't even scratched the surface but this one is a must read.
1781162646|5.0|Although I have been reading King on and off for years, I had begun to be turned off by some of his earlier works; he seemed to revel in building wonderful characters and situations only to kill them off in the most gruesome ways imaginable. However, for the last eight to ten years or so, perhaps since his own brush with mortality or merely due to his growing older, I noted his works had softened, broadened, and generally become (for me) all the better for it. The apotheosis of this broadening was 11/22/63,a novel that still resonated with me, even though I read it over a year ago. And now comes JOYLAND which, although vastly different in scope and intent than his Kennedy novel, vibrates with much the same feeling of time's passage and youthful dreams slipping away. On its surface, JOYLAND may seem a pastiche of some of Bradbury, some of Sturgeon, some of german expressionist cinema, and the film CARNEY. However, King makes it much, much more and throws in a good mystery to boot. Tge novel is suffused with a warm sense of nostalgia, loss, regret, and a yearning for a simpler past (before, if you will, we are all thrust out of Eden and into the world of experience). There are passages of such supple beauty in this book, that I stopped and read them over and over; by the novel's end,I did not want to leave the characters behind. Now I eagerly await Doctor Sleep!
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|I've loved this movie for years and love the brownies and the fairies and this wonderful man, Willow, who is so earnest in his work , his family and his responsibility towards a foundling baby girl. Such a wonderful film and very hilarious too. Mad Martigan the man who tries to be so bad but is really such a good friend to Willow in a marvelous begrudging sort of way. A lesson in what can happen to adult bullies when they are tested with real life with scary situations and challenges.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|Movie relies on special effects explosions and dramatic lighting and camera angles but lacks the clever engaging of the viewer which was the appealing feature of the original 007 movies.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|The female chararcter was a very entertaining strong funny character. I liked how she didn't stay oblivious to Colins flaws and how she learned to love him as him. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a easy, entertaining, well written book to read.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|I watched the movie on my LG blue ray player and Bose sound system.  The techno stuff was awesome.  Now, the story and presentation at the Royal Albert was beyond my high expectations.  This whole thing is truly AWESOME.
B0052AC8C6|3.0|Best scenes are in the trailer. Was fairly bored with the rest of it. Might be okay to rent for a buck but would not recommend buying it.
B00AH6CCK8|5.0|Sounds like the beginning of a joke but they make a great combination. I listen to this CD all the time. Even cooler to see the DVD version. &#34;Devil's Dance, Of Wolf And Man and For Whom The Bell Tolls&#34; have never sounded better.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|The bad part is...I wish I would have waited for the other half of the movie which is not due out for years.<br />The good part is wow.  Great graphics, great characters, great plot, great effects.  It lived up to the story line.  Somehow there should have been more flowing oration but they did this well with singing bits to add to the flavor of the history.<br /><br />Fantastic visuals yet again.
B006Y5EDRG|2.0|My wife loves shows about dancers and singing, so this seemed like a good fit, but after a few episodes she is done with it. The plot is much too predictable to remain interesting.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Rise of the Guardians was super.  The story was great, the characters were spot on.  The graphics were superb.  It a family movie with a great cast and great visual effects.  I will buy it soon.  It was worth every penny of on demand.  I watched it 3 times during my 24 hour rental.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|love the story. love the artists. i am pro digital though. i think it's still too young (not even 30 years old) to given accurate judgement.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|This was a good cast.  The history is not as in depth as I thought it would be.  The family woes were a bit too much.  I loved the congress peacocks and the voting on amendment 13.  Again, super cast.  I'm not very good at review but I can say I felt the death of Lincoln hit me as the movie wound up the story.
B002PJN59M|5.0|The King Arthur legends vary from author to author.  This movie does as good as anyone can in trying to tie them together in a good story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it!  Works like a regular calculator, so nice to have it on my Kindle Fire HD.  Just wish I could submit a succinct review rather than yammering on to fill the word count.  Try the app.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|a lot like Iron Man but wih a lot of action. I would recommended this movie ood action and covers a lot of ground
B00181MHQU|4.0|I made a mistake in getting the high high HD version. It was disturbing and distracting to see the characters in a semi-3D mode.
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This game is a &quot;find the hidden objects&quot; with some fun puzzles and games.  It has a nice story line and pretty graphics.  Entertaining and simple to use, controls allow you to skip dialogues and turn up/down the sound.  A typical game of this type, and it is nice to play!  I have yet to find a flaw!  Works perfectly on my galaxy note two.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I love the details of this movie. Steve Carrell seems to impersonate his Office character. These shows can be so fun until the required chase scene. Kinda goes downhill from there, unless you are a kid.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like the game. It's fun and challenging. The only thing I have to complain about it is that it needed internet to use.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|Had never seen before now. A friend told me about it  because he knows that I like  most musicals, very good and funny too.
0345803493|5.0|E.L. James keeps you reading and the information flows with ease.  I would like to see the movie when in comes out.  I am sure from reading the book that this is in the near future.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|This story took me in from the first page. Samantha, a 7 year old twin sister falls through the ice and dies. Blame is given to the older sister, Michelle, but the surviving twin, Amanda, knows who the blame really lies with. This is a sad tale with all the drama that follows such tragedy, and is almost too \\"real\\" in places and things that happen to the lead character. Parts of this book aren't the lightest of reading, but it is a touching story that I both enjoyed and experienced at the same time.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This was a good read and an insight into the life of Oscar Wilde and his philosophy as well as his obvious sexual orientation
B00BE97ONM|5.0|Wow! I did not see that coming! Firstly, this book is not for children. There are some strong languages, sex scenes and extreme violence. But if those do not bother you, then you have to read this thriller!<br />Detective Summers is hunting down the Phantom.<br />Ben Green is losing his mind.<br />Natalie is up to something. The mum is scary.<br />Some excellent characters play out this well written plot. Five stars all the way!
B00003CXIP|5.0|My Children are ages 13 and 16 and they really liked it. Even though it is an older movie it kept their attention! Watched it about 6 times now and we just got it a few weeks ago.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I thought this book would be just another boring detective story. You know how it goes: someone kills someone, then a boring cop goes through clues and finds killer.<br />But WOW! I was proved wrong! This isn't your typical mystery/detective story. Todd M. Thiede puts you in the murderer's shoes with unbiased sympathy and other touching emotions, and the feeling just continues from that point. The murder scenes are where Thiede excels the most. You can literally feel your world changing around you with a primitive sense of being part of the story. The two detectives in the story are anything but typical. This story made me think about my whole life, and I'll tell you this: I SOLEMNLY SWEAR TO NEVER WASTE ANYONE'S TIME AGAIN.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|not as challenging as Darkmoor Manor. But a good warm up game for younger players. enjoyable  for adults as well
B00B8YSIMY|5.0|A brilliant crime thriller set on the southern coast of Spain where the paths of bad people cross and crazy stuff happens! There are some brilliant characters in this book, although you wouldn't want to chill with them in real life, and there are some great twists in the plot that just make 'Get Clean' a must-read.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|One of the best productions, Marc and Sergio George are the best producers of popular music of our time in América Latina and the United States, I congratulate you
B001HN694K|5.0|Mad Hatter: “Why is a raven like a writing-desk?”<br />“Have you guessed the riddle yet?” the Hatter said, turning to Alice again.<br />“No, I give it up,” Alice replied: “What’s the answer?”<br />“I haven’t the slightest idea,” said the Hatter”
B001IF5YLQ|5.0|I bought this to replace a broken HDMI adapter and found it to be much more reliable. I was able to connect it to my TV using a DVI to HDMI adapter without any problems. My laptop doesn't transmit audio anyway, but if yours does and you want your HDMI to transmit audio you may want to consider other options.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Good app.nice to have access to radar when you need it . Rain or shine.always good to know what it is doing outside when you are stuck in with no Windows.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I can't have too many of these!!!!!  I have too many gadgets for one person and constantly charging something!  Good price and product.....
B001JP5JRY|5.0|Solved so many bro discussions and arguments with the bro code on my phone. Saved so many bros and is very funny.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|I like movies with Kevin Costner.  This one filled the bill.  Watched it the day I received it and will watch again.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The books are better than the show, and the show is award winning. I am a fan of both. Enough said
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is fun. I do wish there was a little more sense to the clues, but  I guess figuring out what random pieces go where is the fun of the game.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a simple rolling dice game. There aren't any complex instructions and it doesn't take very long. I was even able to get my grumpy anti-gamer friend to try it and he liked it. If you have ten to fifteen minutes to kill and you love zombies, this is the game for you.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is a mind workout. Wish there were more levels. I don't like the fact that you collect items that you don't use.
0345803493|3.0|This book got lots of great reviews but I never read any of them.  Couldn't get interested in them.  Oh well
0345803507|3.0|This book got lots of great reviews but I never read any of them.  Couldn't get interested in them.  Oh well
0345803485|3.0|This book got lots of great reviews but I never read any of them.  Couldn't get interested in them.  Oh well
B000OVLINI|5.0|From the opening pages of a father introducing his 10 yr old son to the world of forgotten books to the end that is more like a beginning this book is a work of art. I never heard of this author until one day in a book store a customer overheard me asking about something else written by Umberto Eco (The Name of the Rose).  She mentioned this book, said it was set in Spain and  had a labyrinthan story line built aroound another library. Besides excellent writing and pithy comments like the one I chose for the title of this review, it portrays a search for the author of a book with the same title and leads the protaganist through a maze of adventure, mystery, murder, and romance.  The book also introduces the reader to a ruthless police inspector who makes Inspector Javert look tame.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very good game. I hope they give us more just like this...interesting story, nice graphics and a decent length (though I always wish they were longer!). As long as they keep the cost low, I'll keep buying them.
B000FCK65W|4.0|A very sweet story.  For those of us who couldn't read in 1943, after all these years, the book holds up.
B00280LYIC|3.0|Not too bad, not too good, the goldie locks of teen fantasy. By itself, unremarkable. Very bland, but projective, characters. Easy for the reader to fit themselves into the hero's shoes. Greek mythology is a novelty, but sadly treated like one instead of being inherent part of the book-world architecture.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|good game fun to play thanks for making a game good for kids as well as adults. I like it
B00000634J|5.0|the item is as described and has great quality. Also I really like it and I highly recommend it to anybody
B005FPT51K|1.0|I tried for two hours to set it up with my homes wireless system I could never get it to work! As long as it was connected to a LAN line/router it worked Ok... Loved the idea that you could move the camera around but even connected to the router it would keep on loading every couple of minutes... I am so disappointed!
B0046B1KHG|4.0|At first I thought this might be a little dark for young children and as the movie progressed I still think it is suitable for ages 8 and over.  Seeing kids in an orphanage, put in a box and kind of lost is not good viewing for the very young.  For older kids this is a riot! I LOVE the minions and might make it a Halloween costume!  Over all a really great film. The main character changes over time and reveals a heart of gold.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love these kind of period pieces.  You can immerse yourself in the various plots unfolding in this series.  The costumes and sceneries are just wonderful.  I can stay up for hours watching episode after episode.  Can't wait for Season 4.
B00CATSONE|5.0|I love it, was very inspired from beginning to end.  Thank you so much for sharing the life of Tesla!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|At first things worked okay then suddenly it wouldn't let me get to my facebook  it kept taking me to something else wanting more<br />information.
B005HSL626|4.0|I like it because it is a no brainer, you don't have to think real hard, just react. good stress reducer.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|This speaks to my soul!  Love the depth of the lyrics, especially on relationships, and the music feels and sounds fresh and different. Thank you, Laura Mvulu,  for sharing your genius
B006LSZECO|1.0|I usually only get books at the library. I'm frugal, ok cheap.  But really wanted to read this and the wait list was ridiculous.  So I ponied up the dough and bought the ebook.  Good, though a bit unbelievable story.  Then the ending just out right sucks.  I was so mad that I invested the time and money. I don't want to spoil it, but seriously, the ending was unacceptable.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Agonizingly slow.  I really held out hope that eventually the movie would start to be watchable,but it NEVER did. Obviously the film is an attempt to tell a story almost entirely through imagery.  A noble cause, but it was just painful. Very little dialog and LOTS of eyeballing, facial expressions, and nonverbal sounds - plus PowerPoint ready snippets of space and nature. Oh gawwwwd.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|From the very first page, Pam Grout totally captured my attention and curiosity as she led me down a path of inquiry, humor and do-it-yourself investigating of this wonderful thing called 'Life&#34;.  Her wit and humor, along with her very deep and subtle understanding of human nature, human perception and our true nature as creator beings, allowed for a very rich time spent.  I followed her down a yellow brick road of empowering self-experience that opened me up very directly, simply and potently to the huge gift of being human on planet earth is, right now.
B00E9PMMX0|2.0|The description of this item is missing an important word.  &#34;Unaltered&#34;.  Until you see that, keep your money.  This appears to only be the altered discs.
B009JZ5FO8|5.0|She talks about getting married all the time so wedding Barbie was perfect for her!  Her favorite gift the whole day!
0062014536|1.0|\\"This review can also be found here: http://www.not-so-literary-heiresses....<br /><br />I waited a YEAR for this?<br /><br />Here's what I said to my Facebook book club in March 2012: \\"I hate that she never gives me my hundred percent happy ending, instead settling for bittersweet. But I love her way with words and the way she makes me think about her story long after I'm done with the last page. Recommending Lauren Oliver :)\\" and I added a link to Delirium for good measure.<br /><br />I rated Delirium and Pandemonium five stars each. Fan? Yes!!! To the point that I actually joined a local bookstore contest (I never join contests because I never win) for a meet-and-greet with Ms. Oliver when she came to Manila (I didn't win that time around either).<br /><br />So. Where do I start?<br /><br />Having loved the first two books of the series, you'd think that I would have finished Part 3 on the day of its much-awaited release. You'd think. Instead at 40%, I had to be honest with myself that I wasn't enjoying it. So I decided to get some sleep first...and started with another book the next morning. I found I couldn't go back. I'd pick it up every now and then to flip through a couple of pages, then put it back down again. Last night, feeling heroic, I swore to myself that I'd finish it even if it killed me. It was torture, but I did it! Yay me.<br /><br />*End rant on my experience*<br /><br />* Start rant on the the WHYs of it*<br /><br />While the first two were written from Lena's POV, Requiem is written from two perspectives. I guess we needed an eye on the other side of the wall or maybe Oliver ran out of stories from Lena's perspective, I don't know. But I didn't feel the need for it.<br /><br />Lena is on the side of the resistance, those who believe that freedom lies in having a choice. Hanna, on the other hand, is \\"cured\\" and should no longer have deep emotions. She likens it to being underwater; everything is muted. In this world, it is believed that love is a disease and at a certain age, everyone must submit to a treatment to cure them of it.<br /><br />Being a series about love, Delirium and Pandemonium were jam-packed with emotion. Lauren Oliver makes you feel so much. The good feelings - falling in love, the fierce loyalty of best friends - that you can't possibly imagine life without them. But she suddenly serves you with the bad feelings - heartbreak, jealousy, the pain of betrayal - that you can almost see yourself saying yes, I'd want that treatment after all. I felt nothing in Requiem. Not even in what, I guess, were supposed to be the more climactic scenes, like the confrontation between Lena and Hana did I feel anything. Can you check for a procedure mark on my neck? Maybe I got cured too...<br /><br />Alex and Justin, the two loves of Lena's life (and mine too, for a little while...book lovers will understand), are flat and uninteresting here. No one makes a move, no one tries to win Lena over. Not that I'd want to if I were any of them since she's so boring and whiny anyway. And she doesn't make much of a choice either. She accepts when one says he's over it, and just lives with that, unhappily so. Then something happens in the end that came out of nowhere so I don't know what the hell happened after all or what happens next.<br /><br />I just felt that there were just a series of events that were stringed together so the third book could be published, deadline met. If this is going to be a movie, if there is a God, they'll put in another ending. And they will not stretch out the last installment and make it into a two-part thing. I swear, I hate this even more than I hated Mockingjay.<br /><br />What did I like, you say? Do I really have to? Fine, Lena's perception of Hana post-operation isn't half-bad. Hana appears different, but she chews on her lip and still smells like vanilla. That was sweet.<br /><br />So there. I'm so so so disappointed and knowing how awesome Lauren Oliver really is, I can't imagine that she's proud of this one. I loved/hated her before for her bittersweet endings and cliffhangers but this is just plain bitter and I'm gonna go jump off a cliff now. Bye!\\"ne that she's proud of this one. I loved/hated her before for her bittersweet endings and cliffhangers but this is just plain bitter and I'm gonna go jump off a cliff now. Bye!\\"
B0034G4P94|3.0|Tom hardy is an excellent actor and he didn't let me down in this movie. I really liked the story even though something was missing. I am not sure the fight scenes were realistic even tho both Tom and Joel looked like fighters. I always look for Tom hardy movies and I was glad to have seen this one and sent it to a friend also
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|This book was a wonderful mix of adventure and fantasy. I would recommend this as a great family book to share.
B0042EJD8A|2.0|I thought this film was rather amateurish and presented an unbalanced view of the problems associated with the gas exploration and production in the US. While presenting excellent factual information and real situations confronting real people the presentation was biased toward the negative impacts of this industry.
B0035S996U|5.0|This movie was just as good as the first time I saw it! I introduced it to my fiance, she loved it too!
B008JFUN50|4.0|This is a rip-roaring action picture, and the most overtly political SF I've ever seen, which is fine by me, so long as the heart is in the right place. And here it is.<br /><br />In his \\"Discourse on Inequality,\\" Rousseau holds in essence that inequality develops from the first perceived differences among men, and then is secured by those favored by such perceptions; thereafter inequality begets development and corruption which beget further inequality which begets development and corruption, and so on. The world of 2154, as imagined in \\"Elysium,\\" is as if Rousseau were confirmed, and apparently by a pessimist to boot. The rich have left the ravaged Earth and its poor behind, to live on a space station, where they hoard all the resources, especially health care. But by the end of the picture we see that writer/director Neill Blomkamp has a more optimistic view of humanity and technology, and the capacity of the latter to serve noble aims. Along the way there are vicious parodies of contemporary inequality, the paranoid security state, the hyper-punitive criminal justice system, immigration paranoia -- pretty much everything out there deserving righteous indignation.<br /><br />The plot is driven by action sequences almost as much as its central idea. If you think you've seen every gunfight, swordfight, and fistfight you'll ever want to see at the movies, then skip this, because it's got plenty. I thought they were tremendous, tense and involving, with inventive technology. In that regard, I'd say it's up there with the best of them, the best being probably \\"Aliens\\" and \\"District 9.\\" A comment from another reviewer here, in a generally strong review, suggested that he was less impressed by the weaponry in this film than by \\"District 9.\\" I respectfully disagree: Just as in Blomkamp's breakout film, \\"Elysium\\" is substantially enhanced by imaginative fight sequences and futuristic weaponry.<br /><br />Matt Damon does a fine job, even if he's never challenged much by the script. Jodie Foster on the other hand is quite awkward, as if she was nervous or something during the making of it. It's a minor complaint though.<br /><br />The film isn't subtle, and the broad arc of the storyline is of course predictable (though among genre pics, whose isn't?), but the several steps along the way are not. Anyhow it's not for everyone, but if you've been considering seeing it, don't let the criticism discourage you; see for yourself.
B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie enticed me due to the science fiction nature of it, and not seeing any of the twilight movies I wasn't going into it by comparing it to Stephanie Meyers' other works. I found this movie to be compelling enough to overlook the sassy teenager girl inner dialogues and how I think it was at times an excuse to see a budding starlet make out with two good looking guys at once. William Hurt was excellent, and I enjoyed the female empowerment the movie boasted. Not a bad time.
B008JFUN50|3.0|One of the perks of being a smart, courageous actor, is that you become a draw, a reason to buy a ticket. Damon and Foster usually make smart movies. This is a movie that is derivative, but smart nevertheless. But Foster is wasted. She gives orders. She's mean. But so shallow the actor could be anyone. No depth required. The plot is predictable. District 9 and Ringworld. We've seen this before. And that detracts from the experience.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have always enjoyed playing this game as a child (with real cards).  I enjoy having this on my kindle for times when I need a short activity time.  I would recommend this for all card game people.

B00634GHJA|1.0|the idea for the app is quite simple and would be useful.  However it is a ploy to sell domain names at suggested price  of 68,000.00 dollars.  Amazon you really disenchanted me this time. I will ignore any sure offers for free apps.
B000WS4PCO|5.0|JOSHUA TREE was the last U2 album that was good in my opinion, their stuff after this was, nothing but money grabbing garbage which is dissapointing cause they were a great band for the first 10 years of their career. JOSHUA TREE is a very mature album compared to their first 3 (BOY,OCTOBER,WAR,) it takes off from where they left off on THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE but adds something different and experiment with different layers of music, creating an album thats very diversed and its done right it sounds like a U2 album, it's just too bad that this is the album that took the band into bigger mainstream, sadly they changed direction and they never made a great album since, in my opinion. JOSHUA TREE is a must listen everyone knows this is a classic.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I am a little surprised just how much I love this game considering how simplistic it really is. But I'm playing through for the second time and it's still just as amazing.  Now I want a sequel!
B000001FRY|5.0|BOY is one of those albums that you must have in your collection, it's simply an instant classic and an album that you can't ignore. This is U2 at their beginning and at their best. BOY and WAR are must have for any 80s fan. This is one album that definately and U2 overall influenced alot of bands today, their early sound is as good as they get even though i was highly dissapointed with their 90s releases and their 2000s stuff the first decade of U2 is a collection you must own. If your new to the band their collection 1980-1990 is a good start, but BOY is an outstanding album.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|A good popcorn movie.<br />Ok it needs 16 more words it is fun it is not war and pease just enjoy it and don't think about it.
B002J8LVO0|5.0|This is where U2 headed for a more mature sound and still sounded great. They did seperate from their earlier sound but it doesn't dissapoint but it also marks the start where the band in my opinion completely got lost into the 90s era and changed way to much for my taste. THE UNFORGETTABLE FIRE is really an unforgettable album and not to mention it includes \\"PRIDE\\" easiest one of the greatest songs of the 80s. It is a must have for any rock fan of today, 90s, 80s, 70s, any fan of good rock music must have it or listened to this, an instant classic, THE UNFOGETTABLE FIRE
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|It is refreshing to read a book about war that reminds us that there are good people just doing their job as well as bad people on each side in a conflict. Franz was a truly dedicated professional warrior but also had compassion for his enemy in his encounter with Charlie and his barely flying B-17 over Germany. It was very difficult to put down even though I had other priorities; I couldn't wait to pick it up again. It was also a well written account of something truly amazing; a story suppressed for security reasons during the war and then just forgotten. The author's detailed, step by step, description of the crew preparing themselves, the plane, going though the mission and returning to base almost made you feel like one of the participating crew mwmbers. But the most amazing part is how the eventual contact between Franz and Charlie decades after the war came about. I highly, HIGHLY!, recommend this book, even if you are not into reading about WWII. If I write any more I will give too much away...
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. Wished it had more after I finished. I finished the game in like there days.
B0035LGXXO|4.0|I can't stress how much I love that line. It's kinda creepy, but very quotable. The movie is very consistent throughout, which I love and I'm not particularly a fan of these type movies. Another I would recommend.
B0082RHRHC|5.0|required reading in high school, raced through it and didn't appreciate the story.  I am so much older/wiser now and<br />could relate to the story,  listened to the audible version.  loved the readers voice/accent.
B000JCSPG0|5.0|The movie moves along very efficiently and doesn't plod around too much. Another title that I would highly recommend purchasing.
B008KNUKVI|5.0|Pentatonix is a great group. They are redefining a cappella to make it modern and complex. I would definitely recommend this album to friends.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|The story came out right away with charm without being too overbearing, which I absolutely adored. I would've liked the Fratellis to be less dysfunctional than they were. Otherwise, outstanding. I recommend this one highly.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love the writing. Just enough drama to keep you interested. They aren't afraid to mix it up and add characters.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|As intriguing as Myst....thank you for a delightful afternoon and eveving of complete abandonment to puzzle solving...looking forward to the next room!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really love minecraft and its is so cool have it on my kindle. But there were a few things that where disappointing. The world did end at a point but still plenty of room to play on, the other thing that I was disappointed of was the inventory. I found it small. That was my only complaint but if you want to buy minecraft for the first time I recommend to put it on your computer first.
B00E6JPJRU|5.0|Still had it in the 70's! Even on doing other artists songs he did some of them better than the originals and sounded great.

0061537934|5.0|My husband races and loves racing in the rain so I bought this for him. When it came in, I started reading it and could not put it down. When he finally got it he didn't put it down either. Wonderful story!
B001F12J48|4.0|This movie is really good for the price, however, I thought it was going to be the actual 3-D movie and not require red and blue glasses.  I have a 3-D TV but they are the glasses that look like sun glasses and I thought that's what kind of a movie it was, however, it turned out to be the red and blue glasses, which did come with the movie, by the way...
B008CGQM10|5.0|I must confess that so far I didn't have a chance to read Sense and Sensibility.  However, my friend loved it and very highly recommended.  Based on this, even without reading it I feel it deserve a high rating.  I would not buy it otherwise.<br />Sincerely,<br />Violet Kelemen
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I could not put this book down. I am already well into Book three (a storm of swords &#34;A Song of Ice and Fire&#34;<br />I really like the way he starts each chapter with a main character in the book. You find yourself wondering<br />who will headline the next chapter and can't stop reading.  Very clever writing style in the old style of writing.<br />I am certain I will end up reading all 5 books.

B00CBKVMG8|1.0|One of the worst films ever made.  Wooden acting despite Brolin being Brolin.  He was light years ahead of everyone else including Sean Penn who picked this role to do a prolonged Al Pacino impression with, put a big fat stamp on and mail it to a toilet factory.

B009NY43NY|3.0|Although Sookie's final love interest makes sense  looking back to the first book, some of the other characters did not feel quite right.
0062197266|4.0|** spoiler alert ** I was straddling a 3 and a 4 in rating this book. While in some ways necessary to build the suspense of the story, at least the first half of the book dragged on for way too long. Cathy's recovery happens pretty quickly as well. She goes from not even being able to think of Lee to confronting & attacking him without hesitation. Seems to be pretty rapid therapy to me. Lastly, while it is not implausible that a psychopathic Lee would return to attack Cathy, as well as her boyfriend and former friend, it does feel a little out there.<br />The best parts of the book were the places in which we were able to get into the mind of Lee, especially in the way he was able to turn Cathy's friends against her. Watching Lee exercise his power over Cathy & seeing her go from being a strong, independent woman to what she later becomes was also a solid point of the book. One could barely make a connection between what seems to be two completely different women.<br />Overall, a good book, just a bit too long.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely loved the connection that Christian and Anastasia have. The sex was very hot also.my sister was the one who put me on this trilogy.

B0083SBMBM|4.0|I must be one of the last people on Earth to finally get around to watching this movie.  Frankly, I found my attention wandering through large portions.  I was surprised by this because I love action movies and I think Joss Whedon is a God.  The constant snarky remarks by the various characters seemed forced rather than funny, and the plot was all over the place.  Although I love virtually every actor in the film, I found the performances of most to be somewhat bland and cardboard cutout-ish.  It was saved from being the most deadly dull action movie I've ever seen by Mark Ruffalo - an actor I've found, in the past, to be pleasant enough, but nothing spectacular.  His character has a few throw away lines that are done in the pithy, snarky manner I think the others were trying for throughout the film, but failed to achieve.  And  the Hulk vs. Loki  fight scene caused me to look up from the book I had started to read while I was watching the movie and burst out laughing.  And not just a slight chuckle either.  Loud, prolonged, spasmodic laughter.  Had the film had more arcane moments like this one, I would have never picked up something to read while it was on.  Thanks to that scene and a few of Ruffalo's other moments, I may actually watch more Avenger flicks when they come out.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the Minions, and this game is cool. Navigate your minion through the obstacles without hitting stuff and snatch the bananas. This game has some of the feeling of Angry Gran Run, or Temple Run, although it is mostly not a tilt game.
B00ALKO9WE|4.0|Most interesting concept and I look forward to reading the next 3 in the series. A good read for Book Clubs
B0038M2AZA|5.0|The depiction of Temple Grandin is amazing in this movie.  This movie gives a different look into the world of Autism, and from someone in the education world, it is greatly appreciated due to breaking stereotypes.

B003G8Y4QO|5.0|While I'm still getting used to the new Doctor, Amy is easily the best companion yet, and often takes the spotlight.  New, younger Doctor seems a bit cartoonish compared to earlier ones, but his youth surely helps bring in new viewers.  Amy, on the other hand is brilliant in every respect, heads and tails above any earlier travelling companion, (but it's not really an apples to apples comparison, as each were unique).  A definite match for the Doctor!  Amy's boyfriend/husband has developed very nicely.  Some of the episodes this year were a bit much, but with current cast, they were still very successful.

B004J4WKTW|1.0|I became interested in the book when I read a summary and noticed that some reviewers were comparing it to Harry Potter (in retrospect, I REALLY wish they hadn't). I downloaded the sample, which contained a prologue and first chapter, and was drawn in at the close. Later, I was lucky enough to rent it as a library ebook for my Kindle.<br /><br />The synopsis draws your interest by making you think it will be a book about dueling magicians forced to play a \\"game\\" to outwit one another, until their rivalry becomes complicated by an unexpected romance. The prologue and first one or two chapters set the setting for this idea, and you are drawn in to find out if it really is as action-packed and stunning as the Harry Potter series.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />The title pretty much fits the rest of the story, which is centered around this \\"Night Circus\\". Yes, like the summary says, there are characters playing a magic \\"game\\", but any development in the story is focused on the circus and the ways to make it more mysterious and enchanting. The plot line of the main characters and their rivalry takes a backseat as the author fills page after page full of descriptions of people (most of whom have pretty much nothing to do with the main characters), places, and things. Nearly everything mentioned in the story is described so meticulously I found myself skipping over these paragraphs (yes, PARAGRAPHS) to find the dialogue. Halfway through the book, there is a shifting timeline that complicates the flow of the main story. I felt that those spots that took place in the future should have been collaborated at the end of the story, to make for an interesting epilogue.<br /><br />The magic \\"game\\" (or \\"challenge\\", as it is mentioned in the story) simply has to do with the boy and girl each trying to best each other at creating better attractions for the circus. I felt a bit cheated, hoping to see some actual battles with magic, as in Harry Potter. The romance is sub par as well, since there's hardly any development for that; they're pretty much in love with each other after a few meetings!<br /><br />The descriptions the author plants everywhere were obviously meant to paint as clear a picture as possible for the settings, especially the complex nature of the circus, which had some interesting depictions of the many extraordinary attractions. I, however, felt that it took away too much for the reader. Half of the fun of reading a book is using your imagination to fill in the blanks. A good author knows to describe something just enough to give the reader a vague picture, and the reader fills in the rest according to what he or she believes. When that is taken away, the book becomes boring! So, if you're not a very imaginative person, you might like having everything described to you at a painfully slow pace.<br /><br />The book did not do me justice. Halfway through it, I became so disinterested that I started skimming, not even reading, in the hopes that it would get better. Regretfully, I was wrong.since there's hardly any development for that; they're pretty much in love with each other after a few meetings!<br /><br />The descriptions the author plants everywhere were obviously meant to paint as clear a picture as possible for the settings, especially the complex nature of the circus, which had some interesting depictions of the many extraordinary attractions.

B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Sanderson has crammed more plot in this book than Jordan did in his last six for the series, but it pays off. Lots of emotion, a real feeling of danger, lots of plot lines tied up, and a satisfying ending. The ending felt earned, and I appreciated that.

0399226907|5.0|This is a wonderful book for all children.  My great-granddaughter has it memorized and now reads it to her Mother
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Overall story arc is interesting; enough story lines (and story lines hinted at) to keep it engrossing without being overwhelming.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|This game actually is pretty awesome.except I am stuck on one certain level.you should not make this game so hard you know.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The last book in the series. It's a shame he died. Talented mind. Looking forward to reading the two prequels.
0765348276|5.0|This guy is another Heinlein. The characters are great, the science is right out of Kurzweil and the universe and society he creates is believable and not based on the 'progressive moon bat pablum' that is currently in-vogue. I read all three books in a week. I highly recommend if you are a libertarian, individual initiative, personal responsibility kind of person.
B001N3GUIE|5.0|I remember watching this when I was a child with my mom - one of the first Sci-Fi movies that I really enjoyed. Now I have it forever and don't need to wait for the networks to air it when they are ready.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|This item is great for the price.  My grankids love the pictures on the wall.  The decals stick to the wall without a problem.
B00003W8NM|5.0|you do not talk about fight club ! Love this movie, love the book even more, great purchase. Cult classic.
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Fun game but in order to advance in the game it can get quite expensive in terms of real money  because the anti for property &amp; stuff increases. Great game but costly.
1400049628|4.0|fun book for anybody who loves zombies or is actually looking for general survival tips. Good book, great information in general that can be applied to zombies, aliens & people lol
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Heroism comes in many forms. This book is about a small incident in the middle of WWII.  An act of heroics.  I was alerted to this book by Vince Sacco, a crew member of the bomber force that pummeled Germany.  Vince is secretary/treasurer of a group of former POWs from the war.  He is, in his own way as heroic as anyone in this book.  I wish Hom an even longer and sweeter life and thank him for turning me on to this riveting, well written and totally compelling book.
0440539811|5.0|Don't give up. Don't go in with expectations. The whole point of this book was to head in one direction, then do a total 180 on the reader and move even faster - and repeat and repeat. Your head will be spinning by the end, but in a wonder, soul-enlightening way.<br /><br />Re-read.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a really great app that allows me to carry my library with me.  I love it and couldn't imagine how to live without it.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|A book of two halves and an interesting ending that challenges the reader. Very clever writing. I couldn't put it down once I started.  Definitely recommend this book.
B009R659L8|2.0|Plots are good but the writing is dreary and predictable.  And there is a lot of repetition of phrases.  Pretty boring.
1451668945|5.0|I am never disappointed in Mary Higgins Clark, she has once again caught your attention on the first few pages!  I love the format she uses, each chapter is short and full of information.  She always slips a few clues in to keep you guessing but when you get to the end she has a few surprises for you.  I have read all of her books and I am always anxious for her next publication.  She is the queen of suspense!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I did like this book but found the plot a bit hard to follow with many characters and a chronology that switched back and forth. Much of the theme is about loss.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This was the first time we viewed the movie &#34;Phantom of the Opera&#34; and really enjoyed it.  We hope you do too.
0425252868|4.0|I typically do not like shoot-em-up war stories, but this tale of human struggle did grab me and pull me in. It was well written and while predictable, still very interesting. The juxtaposition of human caring with human brutality is a central theme that continues to haunt human and nationalistic relations to present day. How humans can find compassion for fellow humans while they engage in wholesale slaughter of whatever lies before them is a mystery of life -- at least to me. This book will pull at your heart strings, while reminding you of the horror and heroism of this and all wars. An interesting study of unusually high quality. I'm glad I read it and have passed this book along to my Dad who is a World War II vet.
B003UPPO2G|4.0|Love the show, but the DVD is 4:3, not widescreen!  'cmon, man!  Can't speak for the Blu-ray, hopefully it is widescreen.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I loved this book and would recommend it.  The story was interesting and well written and worthy of five stars.<br />BUYER BEWARE:  My mistake was not noticing I had purchased the &#34;Oprah&#34; version for my Kindle.  As one of the few non-Oprah fans in the world, I have no interest in which passages she felt worthy of highlighting.  But that was my fault for not paying attention to what I was purchasing.
0440237688|5.0|This book is excellent.  I brought this book for my daughter's book report for school.  The best part was delivery, it arrived few days before the delivery date. Thank you again for your excellent customer service.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|This book was so much fun to read.  What a swashbuckling adventure.  I recommend it to anyone from age ten and up.
B009MO5ES8|5.0|This is a MAJOR RUSH from the first first few seconds, and never stops from there! The only time I visited NYC I feared the bike messengers more than I did the cabs - and now I see them from a very different perspective. All you NewYorkCityPedestrians need to watch this, if for nothing else totally cool scenes of your city, whose is the 4th main character in the action packed flick. I'll probably watch it again real soon just for the adrenaline rush. Plus, I adore Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Also, love the ComboFormats that are offered in movies now. Having the Digital Copy and UtraViolet allow me to watch it from multiple platforms. Since having bought a Blu-Ray player, I always always wait for the ComboFormat to come out - and it will sooner or later, so be patient if at first a movie you want isn't offered in the multi-platform-formats!<br /><br />RushOnBikeMessengers!  &lt;3
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I had only read parts of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer in school so I'm glad I finally read this book.  As we all know, Mark Twain is a gifted writer; every sentence is an gem.
B00821OX98|5.0|Love the character development so far!! Wondering where it's going to go which is always exciting! Got your good and bad guys and some we're just not sure about yet!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Well...You get your monies worth with this package. From beginng to end none stop action as you did with each and every movie that you saw the first time, with exstentions and other goodies.....This is the way to go. If you like your horror none stop...then you need this package to scare the snot out of your guests....lol...lol....
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The book starts out with short stories for a group of characters.  Really broken up, not clear why she introduced a few of the characters and their stories.  The book was okay but not great.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|I tend to watch movies for entertainment and fun, not searching for weaknesses or flaws. As such, I really liked this movie. It was a wonderful setup for The Wizard of Oz with a very creative and whimsical explanation of things. As a parent of young children I also appreciate the lessons on character and putting others first. My kids also love it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. Some of the puzzles are kind of tough. I do recommend this game for anyone looking to occupy a few hours of your time.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Outstanding series. Can't wait for the Season. Would love to see other shows with the same quality & engaging characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun and funny. Challenging and competitive for friends. Recommended for all. Minion rush is a total 5 stars for me.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Can't wait for books 6, 7 & 8! This story just keeps getting better with twist, turns, well-developed characters and story lines that bring the reader back to a magical time. Well read.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|Love this movie...it is even better on bluray and it had three disk (one was for reg dvd) so I can loan it to my sister who doesn't have a bluray!
B001GA1RFA|4.0|I found the characters to be very likeable. The obsession with Katherines provided a unique story line. However I find it very disappointing that the words &#34;Chevy Bronco&#34; we're included, as the Bronco was made by FORD.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|I love Smallville and I really enjoyed this season. I think it might have been the best season so far.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Have been playing a while. Love it never any problems. I'm happy I don't have buy anything too keep playing! Thank u for that.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As previously stated in an earlier review, this book is part of The Heros of Olympus Series by Rick Riordan and was probably written for pre-teens.  This is the third book in the series.  My 11 year old grandson seems to really love this author and asked me to read the books.  I am now reading the last book and was surprised that I enjoyed them as much as I did.  I think girls will like these books as much boys. The ending leaves you hanging there, so you can't wait for the next book in the series.
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|I didn't have high hopes for this film and expected it to be a run of the mill B Movie action flick.  It was mediocre at best.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Although &#34;The Heros&#34; by Rick Riordan is a set of 3 books written for pre-teens and a bit older, I found the first two books to be quick reading and exciting, though a bit weird.  I am a grandmother and my grandson gave me the 3 books to read.  I down loaded this one to my Kindle for easier reading.  If you buy these books make sure to read then in order or the story will be quite confusing.  I would recommend this series to anyone over 11, male or female.  They have a little bit of everything mixing greek an and roman history with modern and future times.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I love t this album / CD because every song on it is one I want to hear. For the most part- you can't say that for the majority of albums. The songs are nostalgic & very familiar. I get to re-live my youth with each song!
B008BM0IUG|4.0|A good mixture of entertaining and informative writing that keeps you reading. The Higgs is big news but even more is the story of the people, ideas, and process  that makes the finding of the Higgs particle, so much a human achievement.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This author has a way of speaking to the darker side of human nature and to the side of females that want to &#34;fix&#34; the broken.
B005XI91FY|5.0|What an amazing follow up to their debut album!  While the raunchy lyrics will most always keep these guys off the radio, they rock so incredibly hard with awesome 80's-esque shredding guitars and lyrics.  If you liked the first album, get this one!
B00E8B1358|5.0|My kids and I enjoyed this movie because of the cool non-stop action. We enjoyed the first movie so this was just a perfect addition.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|I could not figure out if I like the game or not because it came up to purchase it for $39.99 in less than a minute of opening.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Very interesting style of writing a zombie tale.<br /><br />It's not like the movie, but is really good. (So is the movie, btw.)
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|If you like Angry Birds, you will love Angry Birds Seasons!  There are some very funny and very tough scenes to get through, good luck!
B006MPKD54|4.0|A slow start but the story built well to a very good unexpected climax.<br />Maybe all the questions were not answered and doubt still remains ........
B000N3ST3Y|5.0|Was everything I wanted in an album. There were several big hits that were missing on my other greatest hits album. This was perfect.
B008PZZFHA|3.0|My son wanted to see this film...OMG...the language is awful but if you are into South Park then you will enjoy it.  I did dishes...folded clothes...and &#34;listened&#34; and could still follow the plot...I think it had one...
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game - you are looking for hidden objects and signs that will help you solve the riddles, build contraptions and so forth.  Intriguing and not a pointless search.  A very intelligent game that reminds me of Myst.
B003OCFJ7U|5.0|This and Labyrinth came out in the same year, making it Jennifer Connelly's debut on the big screen.  In this tale of terror, a serial killer is haunting a boarding school.  Jennifer Connelly has a unique talent, in that she can communicate with, and control, bugs.  Bugs of all kinds, every shape and size. This helps greatly when the killer confronts her, but is that the whole story?
B000VM9Z8K|4.0|This book is great! It contains humor, regret and more! A must read! Second book so far by this author and wont be my last!
B007NQNRPO|3.0|A pair of astronauts meet something dark and mysterious while fixing something on their rocket.  The suspense just wasn't there at all.  I like Johnny Depp, but not even he can totally save this snooze-fest.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The novel covered every range of emotion a human can go thru.  Some that each one of us has experienced; others we can only imagine.  The notion of time travel took a back seat once King started to develop the characters.  Found myself crying at several points in the book.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Must read! Wish the ending was a little.more.detailed but over a wonderful ending to touching an inspiring store great series
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|WORKS perfectly and never messes up. I love the memory function it's very helpful. With all the different features this app is still simple. In short a great app.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keeps your mind active<br />  Fun game would recommend for anyone. Can be tough at times but can be addicting but fun
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|A very great game to play fun different things to do and grow and a lot of things to collect
B00015YVD6|5.0|I love all Tom Hanks movies but this one I just had to order for my 13 year old daughter who never saw it. Eugene Levy is friggen Hilarious!!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The only reason why I didn't give it 5 stars was because it began to get predictable. But it is beautiful nonetheless. Love the storyline and the characters. And it has an incredible ending!!!
B00DP3IESY|4.0|A little bit too long. There was too much Tom Cruise and too little Samuel L Jackson. It was a little predictable.
B007L4HFDI|5.0|I loved everything. I watched it as a pre-teen and remember it like it was yesterday! I recommend to anyone any age
B004ZN9RWK|2.0|This remix sucks.  Some songs are cut in mid-note.  What a shameful way to repackage/remarket a classic masterpiece.  Are we savages for the almighty dollar?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome everything. great app. I love it sooooooooooo much! it teaches me how to actually take care of a horse! I love this!!!
1451695195|4.0|I have not finished reading the book, but it appears enlightening. I want to wait until I read the different viewpoint before making a decision on this book. Seller was prompt.
B002RSU9PY|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie, having never seen it before.  I was disappointed not to be able to get \\"closed captions\\" on it as that is important for my husband.  the story line was good, and Hitchcock was his usual suspenseful self!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a great book and better than the TV series.  I highly recommend this book. Once you read it, you will want to read the series.
020530902X|4.0|So much info between the covers of this slender little book.  I highly recommend if you are writing a book or composing a speech or any such related tome.  You will learn much and become aware of do's & don'ts relating to your everyday writing.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Whether he's writing more adult fare, like American Gods or Anansi Boys, his graphic novel series, Sandman, or even books geared more toward children, like Coraline, Neil Gaiman has the ability to create magic. Sometimes through the unbelievable and unexpected, sometimes through language and imagery, Gaiman's storytelling ability is utterly captivating. And his latest novel, The Ocean at the End of the Lane, keeps his streak alive. Part fairy tale for adults, part horror story, it is poignant and suspenseful, unique, and even a little bit creepy.<br /><br />One day after a funeral, a man decides to revisit some of the spots of his youth. He sees his childhood home, long transformed, and then finds himself drawn to the farmstead home of his friend Lettie Hemstock and her family. While Lettie left for Australia when they were younger, her mother is still living there, and she allows him to take a walk to the pond in the back of their property, which Lettie used to refer to as \\"the ocean.\\" Sitting there by the water, his memories are drawn back to when he was a lonely, bookish seven-year-old, and he finds himself revisiting a traumatic, frightening, and, ultimately, decisive time in his childhood, when he realized things on so many fronts were not as they seemed.<br /><br />So much of this story is revealed slowly and surprisingly, so to describe the plot further would do it an injustice, since Gaiman's words are far more effective than any I could choose. This is the story of friendship and loyalty, of secrets, of facing your fears, and all too accurately captures a time when children come to terms with the realities of life, and that the adults they had always looked up to aren't as infallible as they may seem.<br /><br />\\"Grown-ups don't look like grown-ups on the inside either. Outside, they're big and thoughtless and they always know what they're doing. Inside, they look just like they always have. Like they did when they were your age. The truth is, there aren'tany grown-ups. Not one, in the whole wide world.\\"<br /><br />What transpires in this book is frightening, emotional, poignant, and sad. It definitely triggered some familiar feelings in me, of feeling more comfortable and at ease with a book in my hand than anything else, and having to face up to your fears. I flew through the book--I read nearly the entire story in one day--and was completely hooked on the story. Gaiman's writing ability is top-notch, although there were times when some of the imagery he used was a little confusing, so I needed to re-read some passages. But ultimately, this book affected me, it frightened me a little, and most of all, it left an imprint on my mind.<br /><br />If you're not a fan of books that have a little bit of horror and fantasy in them, you probably won't enjoy this book. But if you have the ability to suspend your disbelief and let yourself get lost in a beautifully written and emotionally compelling story, you won't regret it.
B000X2H8G4|4.0|This is a satisfying little device if you are a little hearing impaired.  I purchased it to hear TV audio clearer.  It worked well and I used for a long time. But beware that it is very sensitive and picks up ambient noise when it is pointed in that direction.  So one night on Big Cat Diary on TV, I went into the kitchen to get a snack.  This product has headphones, so I had those on and the microphone is attached to the headphones, so I had placed the microphone in my pocket.  Well, I almost jumped through the roof when I heard this lion roaring and seemingly right there in the house w/ me.  It is funny now, but I actually felt the adrenalin go through me upon reacting to the sound that this little hearing device gave off.  I think it is actually supposed to be a birding amplifier.  Well, IT WORKS!!!! So be careful where you point this.
B005D6O13S|4.0|I was surprised by the comfort of this shoe. When you first put them on they seem snug but as your feet warm the shoes the are very comfortable.  Bought several pairs.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I  have several additions of angry birds, but this one is challenging with out making it so hard to advance to the next level. The ad free is wonderful too. No more clicking and clicking to start a new game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I  am eager to see more games like this one,  Fireproof  made the game challenging and enjoying and somewhat addicting
B00000IPAX|4.0|Great album and one of their bests. I would recommend it for those who enjoy the genre and the album that pretty much made them famous.
B000NDMRCS|5.0|GREAT MOVIE, I WILL WATCH IT AGAIN, IT IS A GREAT NIGHT MOVIE ;  I WILL SHARE IT WITH MY FRIENDS.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was incredible. It took me all of five hours to read on a road trip. I did shed a few tears during the end, which is kind of rare for me. The characters felt so real-- it felt like I actually knew Hazel and Augustus and Isaac. It felt like I was right there with them ad everything was going on; at some points I had to use the dictionary function of the Kindle whilst reading this book. John Green definitely likes big words. It's a very deep, beautiful book though. The kind of book you want to tell people about, but at the same time, the kind of book that you want to be yours and yours alone. I definitely recommend buying this!
0812982622|1.0|Thank goodness it's over.  Finally the book ended.  What a painful read.  This book was chosen for book club due to it's accolades, awards and all the good review.  Wow...book club readers dropped out reader by reader with \\"I can't get into it\\", \\"too hard to read\\", \\"boring\\".  We chose the book as we wanted to learn about Korea and a different time and place.  Although I received a look into life there...it is what I assumed and stereotyped.  Fail.  We went from 10-12 readers to 2 who completed it (I finished it reluctantly so as not to leave the poor soul who suffered through to have suffered on her own).  What a waste of a read.  Confusing, long winded, boring, and it goes on and on and on.<br />If this is what  Pulitzer Prize winner reads like, I'm about to start writing a book...and I may just win.  A serious disappointment; I do not suggest you read this book.  There are so many other good books out there.  Waste of time and money.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I cried twice! So heartfelt and by far one of the best reads... Makes me appreciate my dog in a whole other light
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun and challenging. My son and I both enjoy surfing on subways and upgrading power ups. I purchased double coins and feel like it was the best 5$ I've spent on any app.
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|Elementary metaphysical message. The experiments suggested have all been done before and I've already experienced their veracity. For someone new to the idea of metaphysical thinking and its connection with quantum theory it's a good introduction.
B00E5C3AJM|1.0|I tried to see if this had new Clothes or store or guys. Nothing is different about this than the other one. But it erased my old star girl so i deleted both
B002MCJZHS|3.0|I really liked the singles crystalized, islands, etc., but the rest of the album kind of felt like filler to me. Maybe i'm missing it
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the movie Despicable Me, and i love the game subway surfers. And this game combines 2 things i love!! Plus this game is free so if you end up not liking it (which probably wont happen) you can just delete the game. Also i love the different minions you can get!!! This game is awesome!!!!
B0035LGXXO|5.0|This movie is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING <3 portrays very dramatic, adventrous, and unexpected scenes! If you love fighting.. This is for you!
B00BB22GQM|5.0|This is my absolute favorite album ever. Vampire Weekend really outdid themselves here. I promise you will not regret this.<br />The album photography was extremely well done and the way the songs were pieced together was absolutely beautiful. And, this album gets better the more you listen to it.
B005PK1G76|5.0|Carry anything with you on your walk, it holds 2 large bottles of water in the sides so they won't fall, the middle pocked has a zipper so small things wont get lost, strong velcro holds it to the handle of my BOB stroller. Great value for the price!!!
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|I've read just two other Gaiman books, both of which I greatly enjoyed, but this one never quite connected. It felt like two plot points stretched thin over 200 pages with a sweet sprinkle of closure in the end. It is a good read, and I would suggest that people read it, but it didn't inspire or excite me in the ways his other works were ale to accomplish.
B0002HYFEI|5.0|The quality of wood blocks contained in this set is superb. That alone justifies the price, even without the marble game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My second time reading this book.  Love the story line.  Makes you want to come back for more.  I think that every women should have a Christian Grey.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Very entertaining and I highly recommend it. The acting is very good and the story lines can be a combination of funny, exciting, or sad.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! No... that word just doesn't work. Incredible, amazing, devastating, astonishing, heart breaking, beautiful... The list could just go on and on and still not do this book justice!<br /><br />The first thing I must say is - WHY? Why did it take me so long to pick up this book and read it??? Once I picked it up I had a really hard time putting it down. I started reading it right before a book signing where I was able to meet Colleen Hoover. Oh how I wish I had finished it before meeting her because there is just so much I want to say to her!<br /><br />This book made me feel. Plain and simple. I am an avid reader and absolutely love books that get into your mind and into your heart and don't let go. This is one of those books!<br /><br />The characters we very well written. I loved how honestly brutal Sky and Six were. I loved the way Holder and Sky's relationship began. The banter back and forth between them had me laughing out loud. The tender moments between them melted my heart. I just couldn't get enough.<br /><br />I read the synopsis before I bought the book. Even with reading that I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I love that the storyline didn't jump right into the meat of the issues that would affect Sky. I am glad that Ms. Hoover took the time to build the characters, the relationships and let you get to know them all (fall in love with them) before everything hit.<br /><br />There were moments in this book that left me breathless. There were moments that had me laughing out loud. There were moments that left me speechless. There were moments that absolutely broke my heart. Bottom line? Like I said before.... this book made me feel.<br /><br />I wish I could say more but I don't want to give away any of the story. I want you to feel it for yourself. Go get this book now and I promise, it will leave a mark on your heart.<br /><br />\\"You,\\" I whisper. \\"I need the lamp and the ashtray and the paddle ball game and the remote control... and you. That's all I need.\\"That's all I need.\\"
B0073PPNE8|5.0|Having read the book and loved it, I wasn't eager to watch the film due to books usually being so much better.  However, I finally caught this several years after it came out and loved it as well.  The story is timeless and even if the film falters here and there from a bit too much cornpone, the actors somehow manage to make up for it, especially Jude Law.  He should have won Best Actor.  Great performance.  Still, everyone was pretty wonderful from the leads on down. The film captures eloquently the tragedy of the Civil War and the destruction that it wrought on the souls of those who endured it.  Natalie Portman was equisite as a young woman with a sick baby who took in Inman, revealing her character's painful loneliness and need just to be touched and physically comforted after losing her husband.  In fact, there are numerous moments when the story takes on great power and captures the awful absurdities of war, like the battle scene in which union soldiers literally dig their own grave by setting off underground explosions at the rebel line, finding themselves unable to climb out of the hole they've created and greatly increasing their own casualties.  I think it's a film that benefits from repeated viewings and deserves a place in the pantheon of civil war films that transcend their subject.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I have read so much forgettable fantasy.  This author and this series will now take its place on the one hand on which I keep track of authors for whom I am anxiously waiting the next installment.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Landry's writing is captivating. His descriptions of both character and places are colorful and detailed. As I read I envisioned this as a<br />Movie. I hung on to every word and looked forward to the next chapter. I was surprised by the ending. Read the book to find out. I highly recommend it.
B0095P33IW|5.0|Good movie. Keeps your head in right from the opening gambit. Fast paced, high tension, great viewing for the whole family.
B00BWYX2MG|1.0|had to put on a lot of this stuff and it barely worked. Only thing it did was stain a really nice pair of gloves
B004P8A7J2|1.0|It was bad enough that we stopped watching it half-way in. We had to go back and fast forward through it just to recall what we did watch so I could write this. Don't waste your time!
B008EGQA2O|5.0|if you are a dylan freak like me.  the sacd puts you into a differnt world.  i have no connections with anything sacd has. im not making money off of it.  i just truely dig it. i thank all the real professionals who are doing this.  gabrial, dylan, george harrison, and so on.  if you have the money to afford it then get it.  if you dont then do not sweat it but if your a dylan freak the basement tapes are a must have.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I have watched this movie time after time and always get totally wrapped up in it.  The chemistry between Julia and Richard is so special.
B002PEP4C8|5.0|I read this books in just two days. She is an honest writer and I feel I have lived one more life than just my own after reading this memoir.
B00866JL96|5.0|Plot was a little contrived, but the acting and scenery made it well worth watching.  Moved at a good pace.
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|SERIOUSLY.  WHAT were they thinking?  Worst Google app. Ever.  They have even made it difficult to erase your search.  But wait, there's more,  extra steps,  unnecessary screens,  and oh....that problem with previous screens not closing!  Excellent!  Wins award for &quot;how to screw up and complicate something that used to be straightforward&quot;  Brilliant!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love it.  No more small print for tired eyes.  Pick the size print that works best for you.  Can be used on any device.  Very portable.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Such a good tale of choices made under duress, and how those well intentioned choices affect the lives of those involved.  A really good read, well written and insightful.  A sibling's love for his little sister echoes through the pages.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very good game and it keeps me entertained so fun I can't stop playing so addicting best game ever I love the costumes so cool I saw those all in the movie great game
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|If you are a Beatles fan or McCartney and wings fan you need to add this one to your collection!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Year after year, they have destroyed the classics in remakes, tailoring them into liberal political statements, about how we destroy the earth, aka the garbage remake of the day the earth stood still.... Here, we have just a great little Sci-Fi story about mankind fighting to survive from an alien invasion. Their home destroyed and a need to move on, a battle won, but a planet lost. Now only if they can reclaim enough of the earth's water supply in order to move on to another world....<br /><br />No political statement here, just a good story.... Thanks so much.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love the graphics. Not enough energy given during game play. Takes to long to renew energy. All in all good game.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a really sweet movie about this dog's devotion to his owner.  Anyone who loves dogs should love this movie!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Lots of extras with this package.  Well presented.  Unfortunately the First and Second are really the good ones.  James Cameron added a directors cut that is an extra hour to &#34;Aliens&#34;.
B006S01GH2|4.0|Very cute movie. My wife and i were both captured. Even with subtitles it kept our interest the entire time. I would recommend it.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|great to have all of them in one set... The quality is so much better than I expected... it is real blu-ray quality..<br />I highly recommend it for your syfy collection
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I LOVED this book.  Things are not always as they seem and this book is a brilliant example of that.  If it were up to me, I would have changed the ending, but even so, brilliant book.<br /><br />Just when you think you have it all sorted...bam. New development.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour. Read it. Now.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is a very cleverly done version of the Rapunzel story and most people would enjoy it. I know I did and more than once.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|So I caved, and read this book because EVERYONE was reading this book. All I was hearing on facebook was &#34;oooh Mr Grey&#34;.<br />I'm sorry guys, but every time I picked this book up,I felt my brain cells dying in protest.<br /><br />It took me three months to read because it was SO BAD.<br /><br />About the Characters.... Ana is a naive idiot. Like, seriously. You just want to slap her.<br /><br />Christian is handsome, brooding and mysterious... pppffffttttt. He's a total pig.  If Ana had half a brain, the book would have ended after their first meeting.<br /><br />Save your brain cells. Give this one a miss
0985557834|5.0|More fun projects to try. How can you not love this book. I want to try the sandals and the handle wraps.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the minions! They are adorable and the game is great:-) Sadly, you have to buy most things with actual money. otherwise, a good game.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|The ending really left me wanting for more but in its entirety the book was very interesting and took me to a place I haven't been before. A movie should be made of it.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Great game, lots of fun. Nice to play with all kinds of people. Wish we could choose alternative rules, like passing on a draw 2 if you have one
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I HAVEN'T OPENED THIS COLLECTION AND PROBABLY WON'T OPEN IT.  I HAVE BOUGHT THIS TO KEEP FOR MY GRANDCHILDREN'S CHILDREN SO THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY SOMETHING THAT THEIR PARENTS WERE<br />SO IN LOVE WITH.  SINCE I HAVE LOVED ALL OF THE HARRY POTTER MOVIES, I AM CERTAIN SURE THAT THIS<br />COLLECTION WILL BE WONDERFULLY APPRECIATED.  JUST HOPE I AM AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO SEE THEIR<br />FACES AND GET THEIR REACTIONS.  HURRY UP GRANDCHILDREN.....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This show is so suspenseful it hurts. It's fantastic, the characters are great and you fall in love with them knowing you could lose any one of them at any time.Season three was the best season so far.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I didn't love this book due to the main character. I found Charlie to be unlikable due to the weakness in his character. I just didn't relate to his personality so had trouble getting into the storyline.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I had trouble with the book, and less trouble understanding the movie. It's one of those movies that leaves you scratching you head after you watch it (with subtitles on!!). Still the characters, the acting and the premise--what you can understand of it--capture the audience's interest!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I loved this book. I found it so interesting. The storyline was captivating and the characters were very likable. I would highly recommend it to others. It really made you think about life after death and our connection to loved ones that we have lost.
B00DU74U74|2.0|This is probably a 3-star film, but I struggled with my (high) expectations from having read the (better) book first. I can give it two stars at best. It lacked any development of character of any depth whatsoever.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Funny!  That's it!  What more do you need?  It delivers laughs, tears, and more laughs who wouldn't love this movie.  Unless your void of them.  Love me a minion!
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|I thought this movie was excellent! Lincoln and his First Lady were played superbly, my favorite two scenes being Sally Fields demanding to be put into an asylum this time, and the line delivered during the carriage ride, saying something to the effect of, \\"We must try to be happier.\\" A good movie to watch with friends to discuss afterward!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|It's the beginning before the end.  This is the movie that should've come before the Fellowship.  Sort of like Star Wars.<br />Who comes up with the sequential order?<br /><br />Anyway, I didn't like it as much as fellowship.  Some of it is lack luster and doesn't work well.  However, Bilbo is totally believable and is a fiesty little Hobbit.  The Dwarves are snarky bunch but what seems to missing, to me, is chemistry.  It didn't seem to work on screen and parts were a struggle to watch.  However, Jackson does a good job at keeping up the intensity of the movie.<br /><br />If you're a Jackson fan and a J.R. Tolkein fan, there is no doubt that you are going to love it.  I like Tolkein, but not fanatically and that may altar my perception of this this film.  It's enjoyable, fun, funny at times, and intense, also.  It's not a 3 star movie to me, because the story is beautifully told and rendered on the screen.  It's not a five because of chemistry and more of the same from the Fellowship.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. Its a king of game for when your bored. Maybe going on a trip. This game is for all ages. I think the trick to this games is to stay on top of the trains. Its really fun and you need quick eyes and reflexes to get major miles.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Awesome game I just started  and I love it I have a park on my iPod touch and I am doing really good I have 3 rainbow dragons
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Best puzzle app I've tried in a long time. I wish the energy regenerated faster so I could play more!
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Matt Damon has won me over!<br />This movie was great. Script was well developed and kept me engaged throughout its entirety.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I would be willing to buy this app if it had more levels. Needs alot more levels finished all too fast. But we'll worth being free.
1475143389|5.0|Mike cuts through all the gimmicks and explains very clearly why and when we should or shouldn't do or eat certain things. I find this really reassuring since I feel it is maximizing my time and the effectiveness of my diet and training. I am just getting back in shape after years off. I did 6 weeks of p90x which I loved and the cardio was challenging enough at first but doable so I kept going. After 6 weeks I switched to Insanity, which i just completed, as it is easier to do while traveling and the cardio is more intense. I'm very happy that I did that as my core is much stronger and now I am ready to take on BLS. I photograph the top chefs in the country and have tons of great cookbooks. I also really recommend &#34;The Shredded Chef&#34;. The meals are easy and truly delicious. Ordering &#34;Cardio Sucks&#34; next. At 43 I am not interested in getting puffy just to look big and I can tell that with Mike's program I will gain size but I will gain strength and be in the best shape of my life.
B002K0WBXW|3.0|The transition from tyrannical boss/fearful servant to lovey dovey couple is not very convincing. Too sudden. Too fake. But then, what some people would do for a green card...
B00992CF6W|4.0|This ios kindle fire minecraft is good.... but you should add tall grass maybe sun and stars maybe some light bulbs or sometime a holiday special! But really add red stone and pistons also plenty of decor it's make ios minecraft epic and da bomb<br />PLEEAAASEEE ADD THEM THNX
B000PC0SPU|3.0|Good book. Essential information. Lots of resources at the end of each chapter. The book is easy to follow.  Good perspective on the other side of the brain.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I thought this book was absolutely wonderful, I couldn't put it down once I started reading. I can't wait to read Inferno. I know it will be just as good if not better.
B00DRPVE3M|1.0|So terrible they have taken a great card game and make you pay tokens which costs real money absolute garbage dont waste your time. Terrible job gameloft
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|The characters develop nicely in this second season. Look for subtle  hints of ethnicity. What do you suppose the writers are implying.?
B008476HBM|5.0|Read it! Mrs. Bennet is my favourite character. I love the way that woman can change her mind about everything, in less than a second.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|This was my introduction to the Doctor Who universe. With that being said, I really enjoyed Christopher Eccleston's take on the Doctor. Most of the episodes were executed really well by Billie Piper and Christopher. With the budget that the BBC gave the writers, directors and producers, it was all just one heck of a ride for me. I must say, though, that I really wished Christopher had stayed on for at least one more season, but to each his own. Either way, it was a great kickoff to see Doctor Who come into its own as the series progressed.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Superb actors..great storyline...beautiful scenery and sets..have enjoyed every episode! Have watched all three seasons in one week and look forward to season four.
B001AG52AG|1.0|I wasted my money getting this movie.  A fantasy movie starring Nicole Kidmand,  Daniel Craig - how can it be boring?  But it is!!  Yes, visual effects are stunning and the movie LOOKS interesting.  But in the middle of the movie, I turned it off.  It is bad enough that I wasted money on this loser.  I was not going to waste my time any further!!<br /><br />Why is this movie so bad?  It is because there is no way anyone can relate to characters in this movie.  It is set in an alternative universe and all characters in this movie  act in very non sensical fashion.  I mean, what is the big deal with the shoulder bag??  And who the hell cares about these good looking but odd characters??  How can anyone relate to what they are thinking or what they are trying to do?<br /><br />Oh I see.  I guess I should have paid more attention to little critters who really represent their inner thoughts and intention.  Is that the key?<br /><br />Actually the real key is that the author, screen writer,  and the movie producer may have little gerbils running around in their heads.  I have no other explanation for this awful movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The graphics and the puzzles are excellent! I need more of this and a longer game! Please make more. I am dying to see what happens next.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a recent convert and only have two more episodes to &#34;catch up&#34; on and then I will have to wait like everyone else for the upcoming 4th session.  Catching up with entire seasons at one time can be quite addictive.
B000002KZ6|5.0|This album stands the test of time. Great lyrics and funky beat! Still makes me dance! And I am 56!
B0015DYIH2|3.0|The writing in this last book was great however, I did not like the story as much. I have mixed feelings about some things. One of them was Jacob's imprinting on Renessme. I don't know why for sure but, it kind of creeped me out a bit considering some imprinting is attracted to a lover and not friend. That was the only thing that really bothered me. One thing I really love throughout all the books is the humor they share.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Jonas Jonasson has written an original and very engaging book. I am glad I read it! The only reason for not getting 5 stars from me was that it could be a little long-winded at times and the way the dialogue was designed, with all proceeded by a dash and no quotation marks instead, was a small bit distracting. But a very interesting and well written character study. I especially enjoyed the main character's (Allan's) unending optimism and spontaneity and the subtle humor that went with it. All characters were well developed so that I relished seeing what path they would take as their lives intertwined. Also, Jonasson explores Allan's character with stories of his past, interspersed throughout the book and these tales are even more amazing and amusing than the present plot, partially because they are set in times and with people and events known to us, yet with a totally new and different up-close-and-personal point of view. Curl up and sink in or lay back and soak it up, a wonderful book.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Great variety of musical selections! Bought it for &#34;Stay&#34; which I heard on the awards show. Discovered I also liked many more of her<br />songs which I had never heard before! Glad I chose it! You will not be disappoined!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|It didn't meet my expectations. I may like it if I watched more episodes.  I was looking for something a little different.
0062502182|5.0|this book was in excellent condition and was right on time.  i bought it for a book report for my kid and it has a lot of interesting ways to see the world.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is super addicting. But hey, you get to kill off all life on earth without repercussions. I love this game :p
0062235893|5.0|I bought this book for my soon to be granddaughter.  I was looking for the regular hard-bound one; but could not find it.  My grandson loved to be read this little book.
B001LF347E|5.0|Merlin is the best. Great for family viewing. Was so bummed when BBC took it off the air. This order arrived in a timely manner, and was packed very well. No scratches on the disks, plays great, and I will enjoy watching it over and over again. I will be ordering all the seasons as well, just can't do it all at once.<br />I believe this is a great deal, and you won't be sorry for ordering Season 1 of Merlin. Dragons and Magic and laughs, what's not to love.<br />  Abbygail
B007PVHMCG|2.0|I am stunned that so few feel ripped off be the price for this tiny junk. Shows what idiots se are as consumers. As someone who has purchased his son dozens of Lego sets over the years, the price tag on this set indicated something much more substantial. My son is surprised but not  completely displeased , but it wasn't his money, either. I don't want to hear about \\"collectibles\\", either--it is a cheap, plastic toy, not an heirloom. My fault for not reading past the mindless \\"It's perfect!\\" reviews and finding the ones that are rational and realistic.
B0061S0A64|1.0|Crash on droid pro. Unable even to open it. Maybe you will need two cores at least to run it.
B008LVCKH6|4.0|A fun read.  Nice summer relaxation.  A nice way to spend a couple of lazy afternoons or evenings on the weekend.
B00138EZLI|5.0|I love this cd. I would listen to this cassette everyday in the 90s on my way to and from work.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was so much more than a story about young love. I became highly invested in the characters, which, to me, is the sign of a great story.
B008H7HE9S|5.0|Everytime Maroon 5 comes out with a new album it seems to be better than the last if that's possible!  This exceeded my expectations as they always do.  My favorite song is Sad.  There is not a bad song on the album.  You can't say that about many albums.
B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Game is supposed to be free but you have to use Uno tokens to play a game.  Guess how you get the tokens...with actual money.  The game is free to download just not to play.  You don't need money to play Words with Friends.
B009AMAGXK|5.0|I love weird movie and syfy so this was right up my alley. I love the Blu-ray for home then the DVD for my travel player.
B00181JGI2|5.0|Great movie, great condition, great buy. The only way it could have gotten any better was if it came with a rug.
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Such a great post apocalypse movie. Denzel walks the path of the lord through the desolation man. Mila Kunis adds the flare to the protagonist and Oldman, great as is anything he does.
B00DHSK3RM|3.0|Doesn't really help.  I wish there were directions to the game.  Been stuck on level 65 for 2 weeks,  Don't want to spend money just to power up and finish the level.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|I love this movie. I have watched so many times. Olga kurylenko as beautiful as she always is. Freeman and Cruise give a star performance that captivate you and bring you deep in the story. The special effects and cinematography are pure eye candy making the movie enjoyable to watch over and over.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This was a scholarly well researched unbiased work. The author has is very knowledgeable about the period and puts the gospel version we have been taught into that context. Fox News was way out of line questioning his credentials.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|You cant stop laughing at this movie and enjoying each time. I can't get enough of the minions, more minion movies should be developed as well as more DM sequels
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Provides a great take on are universe. Great show for all ages; can't wait to finish all the series. I wish you can download for when wifi is not available
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|I wish had seen this movie in the theaters. Its such a powerfully moving action drama. One of Collin's best performances. The ending action sequence keeps you on nerves waiting for his final vengeance.
B006S01GH2|2.0|Weird movie, I guess it's just not my type of movie very weird for my taste and reading captions makes it just boring.
B00DU74U74|5.0|I definitely recommend for the sci fi fan who wants to watch a romantic movie with their girlfriend who may not like sci fi, but stay in the sci fi realm.  Good twist on invasion earth concept with the heart and sensitivity of  &#34;CHICK&#34; flic.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I love temple run oz!!!!!! I like that you can turn to dark forest. I like the hot air balloon!!!! :)
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is lots of fun and an enjoyable way to waste a weekend afternoon. It's a must have for anyone who enjoys Sim games
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best ever calculator. if I need a calculator for anything I go looking for my kindle. Easy to use.  Didn't take time to figure out how to use it.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|FOR SOME REASON, I KEPT HAVING PROBLEMS WITH THE MOVIE WHILE I WAS WATCHING IT. I ALSO NOTICED THAT I WAS CHARGED 2 OR 3 TIMES MORE THAN WHAT I HAD PLANNED.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Being middle-aged myself, I found this book VERY educational about Alzheimer's in general.  Hearing her tell the story through her own experience as the disease progresses was so moving.  A little disappointed at the ending.... would've liked more story line after year 2 or 3.  Maybe a Still Alice Book 2??
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If your a temple run or any of the despicable me movies you will love this and is fun for all ages
B0057VY45O|5.0|Great show, laughed my ass off first episode, which only a few certain shows can do.  Witty, great lines and characters.
B00992CF6W|4.0|The new version won't let u go on multiplayer u less u have an email with minecraft they should just people on it it would be fun and cool but it's stupid cause all you do is build no people are on
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|This always happens when I order a movie. Amazon says rent for 48 hrs and if I start watching it and turn it off to finish later it asks me to pay again<br /> At least Google has a number to call!
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandchildren told me about this game, now I loved it.<br />This is a game that the whole family can play.
1452000247|5.0|I discovered from the author notes that William O'Brien resides in a small English village - the fertile inspiration of some of the land's most imaginative writers, Emily Brontë, Lewis Carroll, Daphne du Maurier, the list is endless, as are the misty, dark tales they have spun.<br /><br />In this tradition, we find the eponymous Peter from a Darkened Fairytale on his tenth birthday cast into a purple forest searching for a friend and finding himself in the company of an intriguing cast of magical characters including a white witch and a beautiful young elf named Slip who makes him feel nervous, as beautiful young elves tend to make growing boys feel.<br /><br />Having devoured Tolkien and the JK Rowling books, I can still recall what moves and inspires pre-teens when it comes to reading and this surreal journey with its dark edges and subplots that tell morality tales in new and fresh ways will hit the spot. Highly recommended.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|*SPOILER WARNING*<br /><br />Man of Steel was good but not great. Heavy emphasis on special effects with a thin story. Reeve's portrayal remains superior though Cavill is convincing as Kal-El (being given more lines might have helped him even more). Cavill did come across as a true pro in the marketing interviews for this film and that counts for a lot. Most but not all of the performances are good. This seems like a remake of Superman: The Movie and Superman II. This slightly different take on the Superman mythology sees Superman discarding his dual identity so don't expect him to be jumping back and forth as Clark Kent (who appears only in the final seconds). Lex Luthor, Otis and Jimmy Olsen are missing. The scene of old Pa Kent (Kevin Costner) dying is particularly irksome and laughable as he is engulfed in a slow-moving tornado while he yells at Young Clark who stands \\"helpless\\" nearby. Some of the backstory is also changed from Krypton \\"reversing its axis\\" to a civil war/resource shortage. Admittedly Crowe does a good job as Superman's biological dad but it's hard to forget he is Russell Crowe. Loved certain touches, such as Young Clark reading Plato. The movie plays out in flashback sequences of Young Clark. Those tend to be the best scenes.<br /><br />Superman's traveling name is only mentioned once or twice and I don't recall Metropolis being mentioned at all. There isn't much to describe in the way of plot development because they don't advance the story beyond a sci-fi alien invasion theme with lots of punches thrown by both sides. Information content is lower than the original (we see more but we don't learn much more). So we don't get as close to the characters since it's mostly Transformers meets Total Recall-like action. The whimsical fun of the original films and comic books is tossed here in favor of a darker Superman which almost works but is not explored sufficiently. The downside is that Superman doesn't seem so super without his powers (it seems to be an attempt to make Superman more \\"human\\" or real with some but not all of his powers). As a \\"Superman spinoff\\" it does work well. This is an attempt to re-invigorate the crown jewel of superhero franchises. It is admittedly much better than Superman Returns and the action works for what it is. Visually it looks good with the costumes and CGI but Superman is turned into a sci-fi/boxing story. So forget about all the tall buildings, locomotives and cats to rescue because Kal-El has important work to do. It's worth checking out but it's no \\"Dark Knight\\" so fans of the franchise are warned. Christopher Nolan lent his name to this work as a producer/writer but don't expect to see his stamp of Batman panache here. Zack Snyder directed Man of Steel and the impressive Dawn of the Dead remake. He does the best he can with the material. The focus on explosions and action allows the CGI to take over. The result is that few of the scenes have any magic. Things just happen. Superman getting arrested was used heavily in the promotions but he is quickly released so it lacks credibility, purpose and plot development. Clark getting beat up by some bully and flying in to save the day in Superman II makes a lot more sense. An amazing score and soundtrack is also missing.<br /><br />Forget about chemistry between the characters because it's mainly green screen stuff. Most are in their own world. Doesn't look like General Zod was in the same room as the rest of the cast. Zod indicates \\"I'm taking over now\\" before he is captured 21 seconds later and sent off-world. So they introduced him to set-up the CGI and go 12 rounds with Kal-El? Man of Steel tries too hard to be convincing (\\"this could really happen\\") but it feels restrained as if Superman flying and acting super would turn movie buffs off. It's science fiction and fantasy so why not make it imaginative and dramatic? Box office estimates indicated Man of Steel would gross over $1 billion but it looks like that was optimistic.If you like the new twist then check it out.<br /><br />The 3D Blu-ray sports very good picture quality and superb audio quality.

B0063IH60K|3.0|This is an OK app.  I always lose.  Although I know how to play blackjack and play in Vegas, this is a fixed software and makes you loose.  If not now than later.  Just a game!
B00ADQCBEY|5.0|I really enjoy :&#34;The Shield&#34;. I watched the last 3 series when they were first came out. Great performances. Will continue to watch.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|It was much better than I expected.  Acting, script, etc... is better than most big budget TV shows.  Very entertaining show!
0345505387|1.0|I, too, did not realize I was ordering a comic book but I was game to read it anyway. I shouldn't have bothered. The illustrations are disappointing - perhaps because my imagination is that much better? - and the storyline disjointed - not at all like Gabaldon's usual, fully fleshed characters and complicated storyboard.<br /><br />I am an avid fan of the series but I will not be buying any future graphic novels. Instead I'll impatiently wait for the real thing.
B00506NRBS|5.0|For anyone thinking about or in the middle of stating and growing a company this is a great read.  Derek's examples (personal and otherwise) add to the ideas being laid out.  Fairly quick read and worth the time it takes.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|Keeps getting better and better.  Really didn't care for the character Donna Noble in season four.  Just had to press through it.  5 has new strong characters that are much more fun.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|This is a treasured classic in our family and I love that I was able to get it so easily - purchased as a gift for a family member.
B003JUGQ38|3.0|Introduction of the new companion in season 4 was a downer for me.  Stories are good, but the main companion drove me nuts for the season.
B000001EUR|4.0|As an example of the strain of commercial hard rock/metal that was hugely popular in the mid eighties, this is an exceptional album that manages to rock fairly hard while still appealing to the mainstream. It's hard to deny the catchiness of songs like &#34;Big City Nights&#34;, &#34;Still Lovin' You&#34;, &#34;Bad Boys Running Wild&#34;, and of course, &#34;Rock You Like a Hurricane&#34;. It's also hard to deny that the Scorpions sacrifice some of their hard rock edge in the process. It still arguably has enough heaviness to please some fans of the band's earlier work, but really it's more likely to appeal to fans of more mainstream hard rock bands like Ratt, Motley Crue, Van Halen, and Def Leppard.
0316113514|5.0|This was a very well written, fairly easy to understand book. It focused on how important it is to exercise just for your heart and weight, but for your mind, emotions, and overall health. I recommend it to anyone in education.
B00005K9LM|3.0|This was actually the first Judas Priest album I owned. Bought it on cassette when it first came out, and at the time I thought it was about the greatest slab of metal ever. Of course one's tastes when they are 14 years old tend to be a little less discriminating, and listening to this now, it isn't nearly the masterpiece it once seemed. Which is not to say it isn't a decent album. Album opener &#34;Freewheel Burnin'&#34; is up there with the best of the band's anthems, and though the lyrics may be cheesy, &#34;Love Bites&#34; and &#34;The Sentinel&#34; still deliver the goods. The rest of the album is respectable but, compared to its predecessor 'Screaming for Vengeance', 'Defenders' feels a bit uninspired. It doesn't help that the production is flat and a bit muddy sounding. As with all the Priest remasters, there are a pair of bonus tracks. &#34;Turn on Your Light&#34; is a studio outtake from the 'Ram it Down' sessions, and can best be described as &#34;for completists only&#34;. The live version of &#34;Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith&#34; is fine, but hardly essential.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy this as I usually enjoy things like Lost, 24, and Homeland. But the writing and acting are top-notch and each episode is fascinating. There are stand-alone eps but a mythology running through the season.  We binge-watched the entire first season in a few weeks.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|THIS HAD BETTER BE A MOVIE IN THE MAKING OR I WILL BE VERY SURPRISED.  I READ THE BOOK IN 2-3 SITTINGS AND THOUGHT IT WAS TRULY WELL WRITTEN!
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Sometimes you read a book and while you like the writing the content is lame, and vice versa.  This book has everything - a great story and really good writing.  It is also extremely relevant to current political and economic issues.  I'd recommend this to anyone who has an interest in human relations and/or relations between nations.  Or to anyone who just enjoys good writing.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Great book to read over and over again. Lots of action and mythology. It reminded me of being a kid again.
B001L83PLQ|5.0|The author presents a view of recent history not commonly seen in the US.  The story line is compelling and the characters are incredibly well developed.  I'd recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in Africa, world politics, and/or siblings.  Or to anyone who just wants to read a really good novel.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|Loved this movie! Not only was it funny it was also very touching. A must watch hilarious movie with and very cool ending.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I had a trouble viewing this on my MAC, but emailed Amazon, and they fixed it right away.  Completely satisfied!  No viewing problems at all through the rest of season 3.  As far as WD S:3.....SO good, can't wait for S:4!
B009DCOU9S|4.0|The game needs some more variety in the puzzles. When I hit a puzzle that is something other than finding objects, it is a very welcome change of pace. That said, the game is fun and is something that I find myself returning to.
B00DUGCLY4|3.0|So far I like it my only objection would be to get more coins when you get the answer right. One coin isn't enough especially if you get stuck on a pic
B00821PCJS|5.0|great acting, great plot, good sci-fi series. can't wait for season 4. good family movie for all to watch together.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good book, but somewhat unrealistic;I would definitely recommend this book! This book is more romantic than fifty shades of grey.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Follet does a wonderful job of weaving that characters into the history of the early 1900s<br />Each character brings knowledge of a different area of the world during this volatile time period
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|it is an awesome game, they did a better job at this game than the last one, i really love the multiplayer version, the story mode is awesome!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really fun I love playing it my friend showed me the game and I showed my papi and he got the game for my brother one his phone
0316789704|5.0|I love the way you can draw any face so easy. My grands had a great time drawing with this book.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|LIKE &#34;FACING THE GIANTS&#34; I WAS EXTREMELY SATISFIED WITH THE DELIVERY DATE, CONDITION OF THE DVD AND THE COST. THE PRICE MAKES IT AFFORDABLE FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO ENJOY PURCHASING MORE ENTERTAINMENT,
0316789720|5.0|I am a adult and I use make a world book for designs. So glad for this book I get lots of fun drooling over my cities.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is better than subway surfers and temple run. It's just subway surfers but way better THIS GAME IS WORTH IT
0316174483|5.0|We used washable markers for this book. The worm thing was super, the flowers, the frog to much gun for children.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is pretty good maybe not as good as computer version but still worth you're money.At least I think so
B00A8V3VVG|3.0|I was digging the music while watchng the movie but once i got the actual cd, wish i had downloaded the choice songs.  Lots of dialog I was not expecting.
0670038040|5.0|Sure, I enjoyed Rumpole -- as usual -- and I enjoyed the plot. But what I enjoyed most was Mortimer's palpable anger -- which I share -- at the secret charges, secret trials (or none), and so forth that evidently from this narrative are just as rife in Great Britain as in the United States since the public was sold on the \\"war on terror\\".  What happened to habeas corpus? What happened to no indefinite detention? What happened to a fair trial?<br /><br />Here he is early in the book on the hysteria we see everywhere now:<br /><br />\\"When I reported for work quite early one morning I found, to my surprise, that strips of cardboard had been stuck over th[e] white board [with a list of barristers], quite obliterating all our names. . . . I pointed it out to Soapy Sam for his explanation.<br /><br />\\"'Terrorists, Rumpole!' He spoke as though stating the obvious.<br /><br />\\"'You mean terrorists came and stuck cardboard over our names?'<br /><br />\\"'No, no, I stuck on the cardboard. . . If the terrorists get to know that these are the chambers of a well-known barrister, let us say, one of the leaders of our profession, they might well be tempted to leave a bomb in our building. Of course, it would be a propaganda triumph for them if they were able to murder such a person.' . . .<br /><br />\\"'Cheer up,' I advised our leader. 'I don't suppose bin Laden has ever heard of you.'\\"<br /><br />To be able to express this anger and still make it entertaining and funny is amazing!  I absolutely loved this aspect of the book.<br /><br />Another aspect of the book I really enjoyed was Rumpole's determination, though old, to keep on trucking and not retire as urged to do by many others.<br /><br />It's short, it's fun, and I hearily recommend it!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Thoroughly enjoy &#34;pinning&#34;.  Most definitely a mind-broadening experience!  My only frustrations are the oh-so-many &#34;oops, something went wrong on our end&#34; messages when trying to pin; especially, after I had to drill down thru 4 or 5 layers to the item worthy of pinning.  Otherwise, it would've been a 5-star rating from me.
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I would highly recommend this show to anyone and everyone. It's really addictive and fun to watch and i'm very picky with shows.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Great series for anyone who enjoys BBC actors/productions!<br />Wonderful characters, great acting, beautiful scenery and music, well-written, enjoyable and also periodically invites reflection.  Was very sad to see the series end!
B004EQAVHI|5.0|If you are in the mood to be entertained but are also ready for a good cry, this is the movie for you.  Totally enjoyed it.
B004T340QY|4.0|Movie was better than expected. Accompanying music was also a pleasant surprise. I'd certainly recommend it to others, even if they're not a George Clooney fan :)
B009GJBEF6|4.0|is of course one of two reasons to watch this film.<br /><br />The other is co-star Michelle Yeoh - who causes me sleepless nights.<br /><br />As for the rest of the film:  there is less there than meets the eye.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so cool and funny when they get hit it slaps on my screen ot never gets old I love this game at first j didn't really know it was game loft but it was sk worth it I really cant stop playing this game u don't know if that's a bad thing or good thing and there crazy over bannanas. and the costumes are hilarious!!! so gi for it try this game
B008J05EL8|1.0|Cannot open app! I don't understand why and how amazon can continue to sell this app when so many people cannot even open it. I hope I can get my credit back. Hoping amazon responds.
B003Y74KCK|5.0|Cheap and does the job.  I've dropped my iphone once and it didn't break with this case on, so that's a good thing.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I'm not looking for glowing happiness in the books I read.  But I do expect multidimensional and complicated personalities.  There are no characters with any realistic redeeming qualities in this book.  No justice.  Waste of my time.
B002BWQ6H6|5.0|Read it.  Just enjoy the way he shapes reality (and I guess character) with these little, soft, subtle and so perfect sentences.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|I read Hounded because the author's bio made me laugh, which I felt was a good sign. The humor was present in the book but it seemed a bit forced. I loved the interaction between Atticus and Oberon, but aside from them  I didn't find myself caring much for what happened to anyone else. I finished the book but I didn't feel compelled to turn the next page all that much and I didn't immediatley purchase the next one in the series.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|An enjoyable game. I really like that you have to go back and forth between all the areas to find what you need. It makes it a little more challenging.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Great read. Must read before watching the TV series! Plenty of suspense and intrigue. Wish the author would write a sequel.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The blu ray version was just like watching a new movie. Awesome price for all four movies. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a movie buff.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love all the dispictable me movies there so funny so when this game came out I was so happy I hope all of you guys love this app as much as me enjoy
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is such a detailed and well thought out world that the author has created that I often felt I was living there. His writing is clear, fluid, and instantly engaging. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries, dystopian stories, or sci-fi. It could honestly fall into any of those categories. Simply excellent.<br /><br />For those concerned with language, sex, etc: Some foul language which didn't add to the story at all (and only seemed to appear in the final \\"section\\" of this book. No overt sexual content. A sweet and slowly developing romance is part of the plot line.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I totally enjoyed this series up until the end... I hope there is another book to follow as I was hoping Mr. Martinez would get caught along with Alex Fisher.  5 stars
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I Have one thing that could be better. I think you shouldn't have to pay gems to get other horses. Other than that it is the best game ever!
B00B9ZC74C|5.0|This book has educated me on the current hot issue of autonomous drones. The consequences to a military line of thinking, from a civilian's point of view, is unsettling, but humankind's innovations are always faced with this dilemma. Here is a quote I've lifted from the Jan. 16, 2013 Atlantic: \\"Nothing is inevitable, but over the next few decades, it'll be very hard to avoid the moment when autonomous drones make their way to the battlefield. So long as there exists a military incentive to limit risk and enhance lethality -- and so long as commanders control procurement -- the temptation to move toward autonomous drones will be irresistible. On logistical grounds alone, robots that can swarm and operate semi-independently of humans represent huge cost savings -- aside from the occasional firmware patch and other maintenance, robots don't need food, health-care, or retirement benefits. A sophisticated drone programmed to make the same choices as its human counterpart could also eliminate errors in accuracy brought on by weather, fear, and other distractions.\\"
B00BIVN82M|2.0|I do enjoy the music of Michael Buble but this cd is not up to his standards.<br />Would not recommend to anyone.<br />Rick Judd
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I have to feed my addiction to Castle. Castle is the first program since Cagney and Lacey that has caught my heart.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I had heard of Bruno Mars but not really familiar with his music.  This cd is more than it appears.<br />I have played it many many times.  I enjoyed all aspects of this music.  I recommend for anyone<br />to open their mind and enjoy.  The strong language does not detract from this cd.<br />Excellent and enjoyable.<br />Rick  Judd
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Had just completed reading the book.  Movie was not very close to the book and was difficult to follow. It's okay to rent but I would not purchase.
B00CPTUN5G|5.0|The &#34;My Little Pony Friendship is Magic&#34; team did it again. Never am I disappointed by the work they put into their series. No matter what form they take, the ponies are easily identifiable not just by their appearance but by the wholeness of their character. The magic of friendship is as powerful here in our world as it is in their world. The only way evil can control and dictate the masses is if they are divided by barriers of taste and there is no unity. But when united by friendship and they see they have more in common in terms of principle and humanity, no one is stronger.<br /><br />The antagonist is awesome; one of my favorites so far. She is just what you would expect from the high school mean girl stereotype and I think younger audience can really appreciate her character. Her final form is the scariest thing I've seen in My Little Pony and I hope we see more like her in the future.<br /><br />Music, picture, animation, style, characters, voices... everything the fans love about this franchise in present and even somewhat magnified here. In short: I LOVE IT.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I like this series.  It is interesting and the variety of characters keep all the different plots interesting.  Recommend program
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|its a look at the seedier side but entertaining never the less. a bad cop w/ scruples? it is a good show
B00CATSONE|5.0|Well written and inspiring short story. Life lessons to be learned and understood from the natural flow of his writing style. Really should be a must read for all students.
B0030U1TW0|5.0|A very good album, not quite as good as Power and The Glory but these were the only two albums that I liked that Gentle Giant did.  See review on Power and The Glory.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Absolutely amazing. A real page turner. History intertwined with current day issues and you will certainly learn a ton/ enjoy reading it!
B000002J2D|5.0|A very good album, one of my favorites even though Steve Hackett left.  Mike Rutherford did an excellent job of taking over the lead guitar duties.  I was a big fan of middle Genesis without Peter Gabriel.  Seconds Out, A Trick of The Tale and Wind and Wuterhing are excellent albums also.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This game is just okay.  It doesn't play smoothly like a lot of the other G5 games, it would be better if I could just pay a flat fee and play through the game.
B000002J29|5.0|Excellent live album, has always been one of my favorite Genesis albums!!  See review on &#34;And Then There Were Three.&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|For starters, this game is free, that caught my eye, no doubt. Next off, I realized it was 3d. Score!! The graphics are great, it's fun, and keeps you constantly using it! It's very complex, but in a good way, you can care for your horses, ride them and compete. Worth it!
B0030U1TA2|5.0|This and Free Hand are what I consider to be the best of Gentle Giant and I have not cared for much of their other work.  In my youth, I really liked mid-Genesis (without Peter Gabriel and before they went Pop), Yes, Emerson, Lake and Palmer.  All are a bit similar in their sound style.  I recently rediscovered Gentle Giant and since most of my music catalog is on vinyl and CD, got the CD's of both.  Found out I still like them and added the two CD's to my MP3 player.  May have to buy a PC capable turn table so I can load my album collection onto my pc.  Never been crazy about having to buy the same music over and over plus the sonic differences of vinyl versus digital file.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed the characters & the seriousness along with some comedy in parts as well.<br />Well written & I will look for more books by this author.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this calculator. Nice size keys... Simple to use, but has functionality of any handheld calculator.  The best part is that it was free!
B004GFN11A|5.0|I like very much I can update it on the go... via my Kindle Fire. Easy to use!  Get it!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I recently had surgery and wanted to read Sherlock Holms while I recuperated. But unfortunately, I bought the book in hardback version. I had a 5 pound weight limit on how much I could carry. And the book weighed too much for me to hold up.<br />Thanks for having the Sherlock Holms stories on Kindle<br />I was able to read all the stories. They are indeed the best detective series out there.<br />And I have read about Inspector Morse, Pasoco & Denzeil, Nero Wolf,<br />Agatha Christie is the only author that comes close to Doyle
B005K17RU0|1.0|Too many other distractions on the page looking for the weather conditions. And then the site continues to ask how many points you want to earn. POINTS?? All I want to know is the weather report!
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|This is a great season of episodes that I somehow never got round to watching in real time. I was somewhat disappointed that after watching the first 5 episodes (continuously) it started crashing on me. Amazon Tech support were not helpful. In the end a good old fashioned computer re-start sorted the situation.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Both my kids say it's great and fun and awesome! It's a ton of fun for both the 7 and 9 year old! They love it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Had a hard time putting this down.  Got this through the lending library and enjoyed the story. Would recommend trying it out.
0385535139|5.0|I read this book many months ago and mostly remember I enjoyed it and read it quickly (which I pretty much do with every single one of his books).<br /><br />This book is good for all ages.  I passed this book along to our young (27 yr old) son who also liked it.
B000MD9UJC|2.0|This is one impulse purchase I lived to appreciate. It gives a similar intensity beam as the original,<br />but much closer to daylight, making colors appear more intense than an incandescent light.<br /><br />Update: 1-17-'14 to ** from *****<br />The tail switch has lost on off function, after very little use. Now, I must hold the button in to keep the light on.<br />I plan to ask Santa for a better LED flashlight.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is an excellent TV series that depicts the lifestyles of the rich and their servants.  It is well worth watching.
B006T5G73Y|5.0|Excellent and got it in a very timely manner.
B005K17RU0|4.0|AccuWeather is a reliable tool for obtaining up to the minute forecasts.  I like the multiple locations feature.  This is a worthwhile app.
0439023513|2.0|OK, let's put it this way: if you 've read the first two books of this saga, you have to read this one because you are curious to know what happens to the trio of heroes.<br /><br />That's what happened to me: I loved the first two books and just had to read this one cus I was curious to know the end of this saga.<br /><br />On the first two books the narrative was fast paced, intense,intelligent and interesting.<br /><br />This one, on the other hand, was lethargic - almost boring.<br /><br />I expected Katniss to change to the point of being more aggressive, more of a warrior. Somebody with revenge in mind. An unstoppable war machine, determined to free and revenge her people. All I've got was pages and more pages of talking, hospital, more talking, more hospital.<br /><br />I expected more action, more war, more blood ... but slept several times instead. I guess that to see the world through the eyes of a highly depressed person didn't help much the narrative to be more dynamic.<br /><br />The book only starts to be more interesting on its final part when finally Katniss realizes what is expected from her and reacts.<br /><br />I also didn't like the way Collins \\"decided\\" who Katniss was going to end up with.<br /><br />Gale was the nice guy and best friend during the entire time. At the end, we don't know him anymore and he ends up being an idiot. This wasn't necessary. To me it looks like the author herself didn't know what to do and decide to transform a nice guy into a villain just to justify the fact that Katniss was staying with Peeta. Something like: I am staying with Peeta not because I love him but because Gale is an idiot.<br /><br />If you have to read this book, cus you are curious about the end of this saga, do yourself a favor and read only the last three - four chapters. You won't be missing much.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|My only complaint is that it isn't longer! I want more!! Actually makes you think and is very entertaining too!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game! It's fun and really easy to catch on to. The first time I got this I thought I would play with it once then leave it aside, but no I'm always playing with it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love thos game. Whenever i am board i play this before anything.some times i am so into the game time just flies by.
B0001I562I|5.0|Another great movie from the past, now a new generation, has discovered it again and they really loved it, great movie
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Great mind provoking programming.  The characters are interesting, out there and yet believable.<br />Good entertainment for an adult audience with good character base.
B0001I55SS|5.0|We watched this my son and his family, couldn't help remembering the first time with just us many years ago
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I ordered this piece of crap when I first heard about it, I waited about 3 weeks, it had to be back ordered, I tried to install it according to directions on the box, nothing worked, I called tech support and stayed on the phone for 5 hours, we tried everything to get it to find my wifi, nothing worked, I finally got off the phone and decided to send it back and get my money back, google then called and wanted me to rate this product, I gave them a zero in everything. In my opinion, google put this item out for sale and they don't even know how to tell you how to hook it up. Don't buy this item unless you want a headach from the getgo.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|An awesome read! It is not suitable for young audiences, but I would recommend it to any one of my female friends.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am not addicted!  Can't discribe!  You just must watch it.  I get totally lost in their world. Such a great get away!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|More like reading a porn book.Give it back just to get of my kindl,as I would not want my grand children to get a hold of the three books..
0316067598|5.0|Its a whole different world that our military people have to live in while we worry about if our latte was made right.  This story gives us a glimpse at the special people who make up units like the SEAL TEAMs.  Thank goodness the country has people like this willing to step and do the heavy lifting  I wish our political bozos would stop wasting such a precious resource as these men.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|Fun, stylish, easy game for anyone and any age. I would highly recommend this game for anyone who needs a few minutes to relax and use there imagination to create their own princess.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This movie made me want to take an adventure and live to the hilt. It will make you laugh cry and dance.
B00351YEVC|5.0|This is Bruno's story.  Bruno is a 9 year old German boy who has moved from Berlin to Poland, where his father is Commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp.  Innocent, funny, sad - and with a shocking ending - this beautifully crafted story is one that I guarantee you will never, ever, be able to forget.
B0031RS894|4.0|I am a huuuuuge Doctor Who fan, and my favorite Doctor is definitely David Tennant's Doctor. That being said, if you are not already a Doctor Who fan, this book is probably not for you. You will be totally lost, because it references things that happened in the TV series fairly frequently.<br /><br />I was trying to pin this down to see if the Sontaran Games were more like the Olympic Games or the Hunger Games. Based on the name (\\"Globe Games\\"), the use of teenager athletes, and the specialization of each athlete, I concluded that this is more of an alien-infused Olympics. Basically, the Sontarans infiltrate \\"The Base\\" (the training facility in which the athletes reside and train), and after realizing their athletic prowess, force them to potentially \\"die for the glory of Sontar\\" by performing in the Sontaran Games. And of course, the Doctor must intervene to save them all.<br /><br />The only thing that would have made this book better is one of his companions (preferably Donna since she's my favorite), but alas, he makes this journey alone. But, in true Doctor style, he makes plenty of friends along the way, and there are some pretty decent characters in this novel.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this book to Doctor Who fans that would like a quick and enjoyable -- albeit a bit cheesy -- read. :)
B002GU5V24|1.0|One question. Where are the live concert videos? When you advertise a box set that includes 3 DVDs most people would assume that meant live concert videos. What a rip-off.<br />PS<br />I only gave it one star because it would not allow me to go lower.  Highly disappointed.
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Another great album by the Master of Masters Songwriters.  We would highly recommend this album for the artistic written and produced songs.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|It was an amazing book made me cry at times I absolutely loved it and I hope if you read it you love it too
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Outstanding series.  Classic production, excellent actors & actresses.  Story line keeps you in suspense.  We can't wait until season 4 is available.

B006LSZECO|4.0|Great story plot with lots of twists and turns.  Interesting characters.  One of those books that you can't put down.

159448385X|5.0|After reading The Kite Runner, it took me nearly six months to work up the courage to read A Thousand Splendid Suns. I knew from reading a few reviews on both amazon and goodreads that it would be another beautifully written story that would break my heart. I was right on both counts. A Thousand Splendid Sunds is a story of love, courage, sacrifice, and betrayal.<br /><br />Mariam and Laila have one unfortunate thing in common. They are born a female in a country dictated by culture, religion, and men. Married against their will as young teenagers, they both find themselves desperate for freedom, education, and life they can call their own. In the midst of the ongoing war raging around them and the brutality they face in their own home, they both make a decision that changes both of their lives forever. As the cities of their childhoods crumble around them, Mariam and Laila make the decision to fight tradition, and to fight for what should have been their's to begin with. The right to say no. The right to choose.<br /><br />Ultimately, I have come to conclusion that I have to be in the right frame of mind to read Hosseini, because I know that once I start reading, the tears will start flowing. The stories he has to tell are frightening, brutal, and heartbreaking. What these two women experience in their lifetime is unimaginable and disgusting. The freedoms we enjoy here in America are precious, and we take them for granted on a daily basis because the vast majority of us know nothing else. If anything, this book is humbling, and I have walked away once again reminded of how truly blessed I am.
B0065GC0BA|5.0|I loved this book.  It challenges the way you think about life and death.<br />I finished it this morning at 6.30am and cried for hours.....<br />Beautifully written.  I will be reading more of this authors books.
B00E7PQVHK|3.0|Updated to reflect the fact that the update now allows original Kindle Fire users to play as initially indicated.  I've cleared the 1st of the 5 zones completely and I would say that the other review was spot on.  Pretty good game although not especially challenging but the controls don't work particularly well although that is more of an annoyance than a game breaker.  All in all a pretty good game so far.<br /><br />This product downloaded fine and then force quits upon starting.  I even did a full restore to factory defaults on my original Kindle Fire and installed it as the only thing on my tablet and it failed exactly the same.<br /><br />Disappointing.  Hopefully they'll fix it or hand out reimbursements and remove this app from the store.

B0059XTUB8|5.0|Director Simon Curtis has gifted us with the intimate profile of the pop icon--a tale highly reminiscent of a similar 50s era saga, \\"My Favorite Year\\", presented through the eyes of a young Englishman beginning his own remarkable journey.<br />  Our inaugural view of Marilyn Monroe is during a scene of her giving a performance of her classic show tunes, courtesy of Michelle Williams in her formidable Oscar-nominated, Golden Globe winning effort. It has not been lost on me that the father of Williams' child was a blond actor who was found dead and nude in his bed after a drug overdose, just like Marilyn, and perhaps Ms. Williams considered this role to be somewhat therapeutic.<br />  Watching her onscreen is young Colin Clark(Britain's \\"It\\" Boy of the moment, Eddie Redmayne)the odd-man out in a prominent British family of high achievers. Despite opposition from his father (Pip Torrens), the soon-to-be- 24-year-old seeks a position with Laurence Olivier Productions at Pinewood Studios, where his idol and family friend, Olivier( a sublime Kenneth Branagh, who fulfills the prediction of his being Olivier's successor by, barring the difference in height and eye color, capturing Britain's most formidable thespian of the 20th century almost completely to the life) works.<br />  After many days of sitting on the couch of the office waiting room, Olivier offers Colin a promised position on a film at the urging of his wife, Vivien Leigh (Julia Ormond). Colin becomes the 3rd assistant director on a film Olivier is directing, tentatively titled, \\"The Sleeping Prince\\", which would later be revealed to the world as \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" (1957). As he learns his job, Colin becomes acquainted with such luminaries as a generous Dame Sybil Thorndike( Judi Dench), and begins a romance with a reluctant but savvy wardrobe girl named Lucy Armstrong(an intelligent post-Harry Potter era Emma Watson), which will be interrupted by the celebrated arrival of Marilyn and her husband ofonly three weeks, playwright Arthur Miller(Dougray Scott). Toby Jones, Marilyn's publicist, is among the journalists who speak with them and the Oliviers at a subsequent press conference, in which Marilyn gives her legendary guileless quips, a hallmark of her public persona.<br /> Colin secures a house for the couple to stay in, therein which will take place more drama than any on the script. He will be present during the tempestuous disagreement between the newlywed Millers, which results in Miller going home to see his children in the States. Marilyn's people, including Method Acting pioneer, Paula Strassberg(Zoe Wannamaker), and her co-production manager , Milton Greene(Dominic Cooper) are there to reassure her, and will have to continue to do so during a filming session as troubled as the star herself.<br /> Characteristically, Marilyn shows up late during the initial read-through of the script, and Colin and Dame Sybil will be the only ones who are sympathetic to her. Olivier, who at one point insults Marilyn by telling her to \\"just look sexy\\" when he expresses difficulty in portraying her character, Elsie Marina, will find her even more difficult to work with as a result of that.<br /> When he was supposed to have been on a date with Lucy, Colin is summoned to Marilyn's house to give her his perspective on the shoot, since he can see all sides of the situation. They have a drink and a walk in the garden before Marilyn must answer her husband's long-distance call, and the bodyguard sees Colin out.<br /> Greene confronts Colin about visiting Marilyn at her house, warning him that he will be just another brief fling for her as he once was. To Greene's ire, Colin dismisses his advice.<br /> Lucy expresses her hurt at having been stood up by Colin. In the meantime, Vivien Leigh, who had originated the part of Elsie onstage, becomes emotional at seeing the filmed footage of Marilyn in her former role and does not wish her husband well in his dealings with Marilyn.<br />  There are charming moments on the set, such as the filming of \\"Elsie\\" rehearsing her chorus girl number.<br />  But their one day off from work, Greene's admonishments for Colin about only having a professional relationship with Marilyn fall by the wayside, and Colin is seen getting into a car in which Marilyn is hiding under a blanket, wishing to take him on an adventure to the strains on Nat King Cole's contemporary tune, \\"You Stepped Out of a Dream\\".<br />  After a fleeting moment of wandering in a park, light of heart and fancy free, they travel to Windsor Castle at Colin's suggestion, where they are warmly greeted by the Castle's Librarian, Colin's godfather, Sir Owen Mooreshead(Derek Jacobi). Marilyn admires a picture book with the works of Hans Holbein, and then views the royal dollhouse, during which her personal longing for the idyllic family life she never had is expressed in her conversation. Well wishers applaud having the star in their midst after the tour.<br />  Their next stop is Colin's alma mater, Eaton, where, upon learning that the penalty for idleness is whipping, the star warns the young men crowding around her to work hard to avoid that fate, evoking a cheeky response by one of the students.<br />  Ironically, given her behavior, Olivier may have felt like whipping her given her frequent tardiness and ill preparation for her own job, although at one point he does express his admiration for Marilyn, given how tough an actress had to be to achieve her level of fame.<br />  Before the outing ends, Colin finds himself living la vida loca with the star as she takes an illicit skinny dip in a pond, and they share a kiss. As they travel home for the evening, Marilyn's countenance is wistful and the strains of Nat King Cole's \\"Autumn Leaves\\" sum up the mood perfectly.<br />  Colin will tend to the ill and emotionally needy star, whose frequently erratic behavior may have been a sign of the mental illness that resulted in her own mother's being institutionalized, through overdoses, and her first miscarriage before the shoot is over. An apologetic Marilyn will leave the set escorted by her sycophantic followers, but personally thank the up-and-coming young film producer in the presence of the pop-eyed pub keeper(Jim Carter) who had been skeptical of Colin's association with the star.<br />  Indeed, it was quite a week and quite an emotional roller coaster for the young man with a promising future.<br />  Bypassing the tragedy of the star's premature demise, the film focuses on the subsequent successes of Olivier, Monroe, and Clark, the last of whom left the world with an account of the Hollywood legend that he chose to remember joyously.

B00D6BWY2W|5.0|It is a humorous tongue-in-cheek portrayal of a future dystopia. Big brother is watching you and 'happiness, we are all in it together'. It has a vey British sense of humour. So, you either love it or hate it. I highly recommend the movie. Despite being made 20-odd years ago, it feels very relevant to today's world. In a word, it is highly topical!

B004GJXQ20|5.0|I watched the TV series and loved it. I decided to read the books because I want to know the rest of the story, and don't want to wait for the next TV series. AND, I can't believe how much I'm loving the book despite the fact that I already know the story! The book is bringing so much to life, and adding so much context. The insite to human behaviour, the twists and turns, the betrayals, the mixture of &#34;old god's&#34; and &#34;new god's&#34;, the inclusion of dragans and 'supernatural', the various kingdoms and peoples, the game and manipulation that goes on with kings and rulers, NO WONDER the title is 'a game of thrones'!!! It's all so true and all so believable, yet it's a game. I can't put it down...

B00DC7N9NS|1.0|James Franco is horribly miscast. If he can act you certainly couldn't prove it by this mess. All of the attempts as humor in this are wretched. The whole thing is ridiculously over-colored and the in-your-face 3D effects are really annoying.Zach Braff's voice is good as the monkey though.
B00B5ARKDE|1.0|They must be out of the minifigures.  Mine did not come with the exclusive clark kent minifigure.  I would not recommend you purchase this item if you were hoping to get the figure.  The product image needs to be replaced.

B0036BK6MW|5.0|what a great movie!! im sad it took me this long to see this film. it was shown on my kindle fire without any problem.  well worth the minimal cost  for the download.  thanks!
030789701X|5.0|Better than the version published with the original game, before the expansions came out.<br /><br />It does have some of the same flaws, but it's much easier to use, and being hardback it's much more durable.  For a book that gets as much use as this one does that's a definite plus.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|was glad to rent this movie so many people talked about for months. unfortunately I didn't care for it like I hoped. it was quite lengthy and the entire film was more about mental illness with other subjects taken a minimal role woven through the movie. I am glad I saw it but still cant say what all the fuss was about. just not a good movie to suit my tastes. it did come on my kindle easily with a good picture.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game and so will you! so go on download it! I love being able to just jump from train to train in this game!
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|being a big die hard fan I had to see this latest installment. just watched it yesterday and liked it. I still prefer the earlier ones but this one was ok kinda  different but still in theme with the earlier ones. I got on my kindle easily and it showed without any problem.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|lots of fun puzzles and great fun for a first time player!!  a must game to have on your kindle
0062124293|5.0|I loved this book for so many reasons. It taught me so much about what it means to be a Feminist. I also received validation for a lot of what I already felt and thought in reading this book. It truly is a modern day manifesto on Feminism and a worthy for all women to pick up. Caitlin Moran is intelligent and writes beautifully. Her perspective is refreshing and her vocabulary is impressive. On the cover it is touted as being the British version of Tina Fey's Bossypants. No, this book is not that at all.  Although I like Tina Fey and Bossypants was entertaining,  How to Be a Woman is so much more than just entertainment. It is both heavy and light at the same time. Heavy with knowledge and insight like no other and light because of the funny, entertaining way it is presented. This book is worth owning and keeping and also worth giving to friends and family. That is how much I got from reading it. Thank you, Caitlin Moran.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|3 stars. It was long winded. I felt it lost the story at times. A bit unbelievable out of touch.

B00DDZM0GQ|2.0|Love the game, it has the tetris addiction to it, but it is different when it comes to gameplay. Unfortunately, the game freezes on me nonstop and I have to completely power off my kindle and restart it to get it to work again. Fun game, but wont waste my time anymore with restarting as I spend more time waiting on restart than I do playing.
B00BD6KPFU|5.0|I enjoy the banter between the partners trying to out do the other. This season is all about not letting the firm implode.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|i love it because i can get the old classic  music no matter what kind . i love different but classic country is my favorite.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The author is able to draw the reader into the story from the very first pages. We are able to enjoy the private moments of two kids who fall in love despite having terminal cancer. With little to no chance of a long future, they act more like normal kids rather than cancer victims. There are many moments of laughter, mature insights, and an intense reality that cancer victims face with each other and their families.
B004CEUEWE|1.0|This was recommended to me by a friend. I didn't expect it to be so violent and bloody. I won't watch it again.
B004NCLKJG|5.0|Here's a live Wagner recording that absolutely delivers the goods in terms of great singing and music making, and in much better than acceptable sound.<br /><br />The cast is the thing that dreams are made of: Jon Vickers turns in perhaps his best-recorded Siegmund, while Birgit Nilsson's Br&uuml;nnhilde is definitive. I'm a big fan of Leonie Rysanek, but I think her Sieglinde under Karl B&ouml;hm comes off better than she does here - her voice is a bit cloudy. Thomas Stewart's Wotan is excellent, though I found his Act II monologue to be a bit over inflected at times, under inflected at others (his \\"das Ende\\" is a bit over the top). Christa Ludwig is luxury casting as is Karl Ridderbusch.<br /><br />The Met Orchestra plays expertly under the baton of Berislav Klobucar. Those who believe the Met Orchestra wasn't great before James Levine took over house duties may be surprised by the mastery on display in this recording.<br /><br />The sound is excellent mono.<br /><br />Highly recomended.

B00ADQCBEY|4.0|It took a few episodes to get into it, but eventually it reels you in. Sometimes vulgar, usually crude, but well written and well acted.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Science fiction is not my cup of tea.  Given a choice, I pick other forms of literature.<br /><br />So why did I pick this book?  The publishers have formatted the \\"Arthur C Clark Collection\\" for the Kindle.  This isn't an old book ported into a Kindle with tons of problems, but rather it flows like a well done book should.<br /><br />\\"Childhood's End\\" is a timeless story wherein Clarke puts timeless issues in front of readers in a unique fashion resulting in readers being exposed to various sides of those issues.<br /><br />I followed the advise of one reviewer and delayed reading the forward until I finished the book.  Let me make the same suggestion.

B009ZZDNT6|5.0|My Kindle Fire does not have a built in alarm.  I read over the various offerings and picked this one for being a one-trick pony.  Simply put this is a straightforward alarm program.  Several features (e.g., different alarm sounds)with the focus of making the alarm more effective.  If you want a tool for the job, try this app.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This season was my introduction to Doctor Who, and I was instantly addicted. Christopher Eccleston plays a darker and angrier version of the Doctor than later reincarnations, which suited me quite well. Rose Tyler is absolutely unforgettable as a companion, but it seems that she really comes into her own in season two with David Tennant. If you've never seen Who, this is the very best place to start.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great form of entertainment, the download was very easy . The fact that you are actually playing with other people makes it that much more fun.
B007SGM084|5.0|I needed time away from my supe novels and Shades was a great surprise. Good read all the way. It is hot, sexy, and great love story.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I have just finished the seventh book in this series and my review is actually for the series as a whole. The basic plot is a tried and true one of &#34;unwanted, despised child runs away and discovers his destiny.&#34;  In places one can guess the next thing to happen based on the premise. The books are filled with lengthy battle scenes almost all of which end with the &#34;hero of the moment&#34; either realizing that he or she is about to die or descending into darkness. As the books progressed I found myself skipping through the fighting to get back to the story. There are a few glaring inconsistencies, such as having the dead king buried on a grassy hill, deep in the earth only later to have him found buried in the family mausoleum when his son goes there to hide. At some point the king seems to have been moved from grave to grave. Another such is when the bitter son of the dead king finds he can't hoist the sword he arranges for it to be stolen saying &#34;if I can't have it nobody can&#34; then in a later book the theft of the sword is claimed by the evil protagonist who muses that he worked hard to arrange the sword's removal. Further, having the Queen keep to her rooms and not participate in the various court revelries, even her own daughter's wedding, then later sternly advise her daughter that &#34;a Queen does not isolate herself from her people&#34; is a bit hypocritical.  As an adult reading these books I also can't help but wonder if the author was not working out some parental or familial issues with some of her characters and their interactions with each other. There is some serious paternal dysfunction going on in several places and even Mama the Queen is quite toxic. Over all the series is what it is- a story for young (stress on &#34;young&#34;) adults (&#34;adult&#34; being applied loosely). They are predictable and at times a bit frustrating. The main character is apparently gifted with incredible powers and is kind of taught to use them, but at opportune places in the story where he could obviously use what he was taught it never occurs to him to do so. Early on he is told he can heal but he stands by and watches person after person die with no attempt to help or heal. He is taught to control the weather but when faced with dying from heat and dehydration in an endless desert he neither calls rain to save himself and his friends nor uses it to protect them from the sudden backwards rain storm that threatens them.  All in all the series is OK but rough. Not something that would jump to mind to recommend to a friend.t opportune places in the story where he could obviously use what he was taught it never occurs to him to do so.

B009NYF2ES|5.0|Again didn't want to replace something I already owned but got it as a special from Amazon.  Great remaster of a great film and some fantastic extras.  if you already own it then see if you can get this used or cheaper somewhere else but you will love the new transfer, guaranteed.  The cinematography shines in blu-ray!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Good game.  Fun and fast! Not too long per player, so you have to pay attention.Definitely worth the download. New coins come every 45 minutes. Sandy
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I have the old DVD of these and didn't really want to put out more money for something I already thought was over-priced. But I have to say if you love this show you need to buy these remastered editions.  The picture and sound are superb.  There is absolutely no way to compare these to the earlier versions - they are just magnificent, period.  If you have a blu-ray player with HI-DEF tv then you should think about purchasing these sets.  If nothing else rent one and see for yourself.  If you love this show like I do you will find it hard not to want to replace your old DVD's.  The series didn't even look this good when it first aired!  Combine the restored elements with the great story-telling and it makes this new edition a \\"must-have\\".
B008L1VZS6|5.0|What a wonderful fiasco, and what a wonderful performance! This second of Verdi's operas flopped when it was first performed at La Scala in 1840. After that, Verdi refused to compose comic operas before his last opera, Falstaff. \\"Un giorno di regno\\" is an opera in the style of Rossini. Today, whith a production like this, it is difficult to understand why it became a failure. The stage director, set and costume designer, Pier Luigi Pizzi (yes, he did it all!), should have much praise for this vivid, entertaining and tasteful production. The singers are very good too. Special commends to the \\"leading lady\\", Anna Caterina Antonacci. You have fun all the time while looking and listening to this magnificent performance!

B00E193Y36|5.0|They continue to grow and just get better. If you ever get the chance, this is a band to see live they do not disappoint and unlike many other bands today they are just as awesome live without the studio behind them. This lends a definite plus to them as a band.  While I do not often pay for music I believe it is important to support the bands you actually like and have never been disappointed when buying 5FDP albums.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn does a fantastic job at creating a personal relationship between characters and readers. I felt compassion and hate and anger and frustration with each chapter. Great read
0399162097|5.0|This book caught my attention because it was on lists of important books from this year. And I have to say, I agree. There are some books that are heavenly to read. This is certainly one. But this is also a book that is so beautifully written that I found myself wishing I could have the experience of writing like that.<br /><br />We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves considers two timeless themes- memory and family. Rosemary tells her story beautifully but she does it acknowledging that she could be wrong. She lets us know that these formative and heartbreaking events may be misreported or even misunderstood. This is such an essential part of the power of this book. The second theme is that of family and what family is. The question of who is our family and how we are impacted by that is a universal one and it is beautifully handled here.
B0015KGWZG|4.0|I chose 4 stars because it is worth reading and contains lots of information to help you become a much stronger mentally and emotionally.  I think to really get anything out of it as a tool for changing your life, it requires reading it several times, otherwise it can be easy to fall back into erroneous ways.  If this looks like a good book for you, I also HIGHLY recommend reading the book Finding Your Own North Star by Martha Beck.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I wanted for my Kindle. LOVE IT! Easy to install and works well. Had always wanted a calculator on my Kindle.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Took me back to the mystery and magic of childhood.  Woke up in the middle of night just to finish it
B005PK57IK|5.0|Characters ,story lines very were most interesting ,kept me wanting more .I'm sorry I ran out of episodes to watch.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun, can play for hours.<br />Wish there was a way to get more tokens without buying them. Over all great game
B000SEHJGQ|5.0|Going into this novel i was immediately pleased with Bukowski's clear and concise prose. To be honest, it is a style of writing I aspire to myself. He utilizes it masterfully. As the title of this review states, it makes me NOT want to write. How could I ever compare?? My only complaint is that as Bukowski's MC Henry moves towards adulthood, the story becomes a bit bland - falls into a bit of a rut in my opinion, somewhat repetitive. That said, I still think its an amazing novel and we are left with the question everyone seems to share. Is Bukowski our MC? To what extent? I haven't read a lot on the topic but consensus seems to be that it is semi-autobiographical. I will be reading more about Henry quite soon.
B00130VLZ4|3.0|I bought this camera case thinking about something harder to protect my camera<br />What a mistake, its a nice but very very soft case
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is such a great read.  I read this and then watched the movie, I HAD seen the movie before, but it made me realize the book was so much better.  LOVE IT!!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Horrid game I tried to figuer it out and gave up and deletet it. I seemed that you had to keep paying for things in the game.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Book gave a non public role of the President's Club and how it influenced decisions of a then sitting President of which I, and friends, were not aware.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Good read can't wait to see how the movies play out. Excited to start the last book. But what will I read next?
B00005AXEL|5.0|This is just an amazing album from start to finish.  Stevie's emotion is timeless.  Listening to this album, you can see how she was 80% of Fleetwood Mac's sound.  Just buy it!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This was a great read. I liked how the small stories blended to create a good book mad me cry a few times, but the ending was lovely.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|very well done.  I enjoy all the episodes and watch the next as soon as possible. Cannot wait for next season.
193700788X|4.0|I seem to be in the minority of readers here, because I was QUITE PLEASED with how this series ended. I read that Charlaine Harris got actual death threats from readers who were upset by the ending, which is incredible to me. It's just a BOOK, after all, no matter how much you are invested in the characters.<br />SPOILERS AHEAD: I have wanted Sookie to stand up more for herself and stop being so polite for many books now, so I was pleased to see that she has stopped letting people (and supes) use her. I was thrilled that she let Eric go, even though she loved him. He was absolutely self-involved, and though he did love Sookie \\"as much as he was able\\"- (his words), he would have NEVER put her first. We find out that he was planning to turn Sookie into a vampire all along, expressly against her wishes. Sookie also said that while she was sad to lose Eric, she was not brokenhearted about it. I'm glad she didn't end up with Bill either, because I think that ship sailed long ago. Since Sookie cannot have a successful relationship with a human man due to her telepathy, I think it was a very logical conclusion that she ended up with Sam. He has loved her all along, and he respects her and will make personal sacrifices for her. Sookie has been attracted to Sam and has had buried feelings for him all along too, so that ending seemed very right to me, and not too abrupt. Sookie's life has been in such chaos ever since she got involved with vampires and other \\"supes\\", but the problems were rarely caused by Sam. She will be safe and happy with Sam, and will also be able to have children with him, which we know Sookie wants! I like how Charlaine Harris wrapped up storylines with Jason and Tara as well. All seems well and relatively normal in Bon Temps as we leave it, and I for one will think fondly of Sookie and her new happy life.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I was sad when I finished it.  I love a book that makes you love and hate the characters.  I absolutely cannot wait until the next one is released.  HURRY!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This is a very good film, just sit back and enjoy. Robert Downey Jr is as good as ever and the laughs keep coming.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|great song! I listen to it over and over again. I liked the first time I heard it. great song!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I had read all of Mitch Alboms other books. I don't know how I missed this one. Once again he captured me with his creative use of time structure and unique story telling. This book in particular touched me. As I grow older I am faced with my own mortality. Having witnessed both my parent's death's I am keenly aware of the fragility of life. My mother was given six months to live and she spent those months sitting quietly waiting to die. Time is relative. Time is precious. We spend too much of ours wasting it on worry. I loved this book. Once again he captured the subject and made me think. Thanks Mitch Albom.
B008Y79IUE|1.0|We couldn't even get through the first 15 minutes, before turning the movie off. What a waste of my time.
B005544V6A|4.0|Love this show.. Spector is wonderful! Sheering for Ross all the way!!! Litt, Jessica and Rachel support really well.. Love Louis Litt's character and acting skills! Very entertaining!!
B000002KFJ|3.0|Not their finest hour although worth the purchase price for Symptom of the Universe alone. A must have for all Sabbath fans but possibly the weakest of their first five albums.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I love this stylus because it has the 3 different size tips.  Works well for me to type on my phone and my Kindle fire.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|We are big fans of David Tennant in Dr. Who.  He's great in this completely different type of story as well.
B009XEE0DW|5.0|Mylene Farmer has such a unique and beautiful voice.  She sings in absolute perfect pitch on every record and live performance I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy.<br />She is a world renowned pop/dance artist with multiple excellent album and remix album releases.<br /><br />If you have never bought music in French because you thought you would not understand the lyrics, this is your chance to experience something new.  The music is beautiful and expressive and carries the thoughts of the lyrics within the  emotion of the performances.<br /><br />If you like artists like Enya, ATB, and Sarah Brightman, you will surely enjoy Mylene Farmer.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Google has always been my go-to search engine but in the process of downloading this app my Kindle anti-virus told me the app was a \\"threat\\" and would not continue.  Not positive that is accurate but enough so that I do not want to chance it.
B00CFYD682|5.0|\\"Love Resurrection\\" has been a very important song in my life; for that reason I deeply care about Alison Moyet.  She is an outstanding singer (search for her version of \\"Windmills of My Mind\\"...it is just so good!) and as this album once again showcases an outstanding songwriter.<br /><br />Every song on this album is a quality composition, that will appeal to both younger and older audiences alike, and each song is sung with the technical proficiency and the soulful emotion Alison always brings to her music! \\"The Minutes\\" is an excellent addition to any music collection.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Challenging when it needed to be and fun all the time I would give it a try.  Worth the free trial
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Oh my gosh, my first album was Seventh Sojourn by the Moody Blues.  40 years later I still listen to it and enjoy every minute of it!<br /><br />This new album by Justin Hayward continues his stellar writing and singing career.  Every single song is worth the price.  Some of the tracks harken to the past, some have an terrific contemporary country-pop flavor to them, which would appeal to any contemporary Country Music Station programer, and the album even closes with a couple of cutting edge dance tracks pulling us into the future.<br /><br />Most of all, however, it is Justin's spiritual vision that makes this album so worthwhile.  As with all of his work with the Moody Blues, he encourages the listener to attune with Source and to aspire to a higher level of consciousness.
0425238091|5.0|This book helped me through my period of burnout. It is a great read and fairly accurate as well, considering how old it is.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|As good as Mad Men, almost as good as The West Wing.  By that I mean, I found myself running the episodes back to back because I like the characters and the scenario so much I can't wait to see what happens next.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|Director Peter Berg has done it again, he brought in an awesome cast and made a a spectacular movie for audiences of all ages!! My brother told me about this movie when it came on cable and I have seen it like 10 times already, now I'm buying it. The thing is that WHY THEY DID NOT PROMOTE THIS MOVIE BETTER?? IT'S BETTER THAN IRON MAN and OTHER COMIC MOVIES BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT OUR U.S. MILITARY, WHICH IS REAL. It's that kind of movie. Once you start watching it you can't stop watching it.  Very good talented actors and awesome alien action and awesome side effects. Definitely going in my DVD collection.  Taylor Kitsch, Alex Skaarsgard, Rhianna, and many other FINE ACTORS make this movie a nonstop awesome movie. It's a must see and must get movie.
B00D2K40WY|3.0|its cool and fun but it crashes a lot and sends you back to the home page a whole bunch of times.Then you have to buy the full version to get all the make up,dresses,shoes and stuff.
B000HWZ4CA|1.0|The disc was a wreck. Half way into the movie it went hay wire. Was not able to watch it.
B000ID37T0|5.0|This movie is outstanding and since I list it at the Top of my all time favorites I just had to have it on hand!!!
B00004XPPK|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful women. I saw this movie when I was very young and adored her.
B008JFUN50|4.0|Not quite 5-stars but it's ambitious, fast, thrilling and at times fantastic.<br /><br />The visuals deliver the goods, just amazing, with a tip of the hat to the gritty look and feel of District 9. Also, and this is key, the fight and action scenes are intense and immersive. You feel like you are in them as you watch.<br /><br />The plot is the classic Hollywood story split, and suspension of disbelief is a must to get the full ride from this movie. Part of the story takes place on Elysium , a highly secure, space habitat for the rich and wealthy. The other part of the story takes place on a wild and hairy 2154 Earth A.D. These stories evolve on their own and then merge to get the sparks flying.<br /><br />The acting is solid as you would expect. Everyone gives pretty tight performances that help make the movie that much more entertaining.<br /><br />In all, good sci-fi entertainment, that does what good sci-fi does: use the future to make you think about the present. It's a solid follow-up to District 9 for this director.<br /><br />And also, whatever your political beliefs are, set them aside and enjoy. The Day the Earth Stood Still, Planet of the Apes, Soylent Green, A Clockwork Orange, Starship Troopers all posed a possible future based on the filmmaker's imagination. I didn't have to agree or disagree to enjoy them. I enjoyed them because they were great stories, great movies.<br /><br />I look forward to more.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0018LX9T4|5.0|A female recommended this movie to me and said this was her favorite movie. I have found that many other women love this movie. This is very telling given this movie is replete with BDSM themes. This movie is a classic and very enjoyable to watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun hidden picture, puzzle game.  Makes your brain work while having fun.  Cannot wait to play more.  Not for small kids.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Great insight and digestible verbiage to help apply it.  Good resource to include in relationships.  Include in library for reference.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is a classic I have always loved and appreciated.  My original copy was lost in a house fire, so this is a replacement.  It is great to have it in my library once more.  The singers stand alone but together they exude emotion and bring a feeling of love of all kinds.
B00CM9JKXU|4.0|Queensryche fired lead singer, Geoff Tate last year. Both Tate and the remaining members of Queensryche put out albums this year.  Tate's version released Frequency Unknown earlier in the year. This version features new singer Todd La Torre.  I was pleasantly surprised how good this album was with La Torre. he sounds very similar to a young Tate.  This album fits very well with the Queensryche sound is much better than the last few albums with Tate (the last one Dedicated to Chaos - was a chaotic mess).  Album is short timewise (under 40 minutes) but is a good hard rock album.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|Awesome music on this album! Daft Punk did it again. Looking forward to their next album whenever that happens to be.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love how you have victors lair and different funny characters from the movies. I don't like how you need internet connection.
0812983459|4.0|I just finished The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry.  It was heartbreaking and wonderful.  I have always been a believer in the journey, not the destination.  For Harold, the journey that he embarked upon opened a box of memories that I'm sure he had wished would remain closed, but in doing so, helped him to wake up, remember and heal.  Someone once said that novels were about leaving home or coming back, and this one seems to be about both.  Beautifully written and painfully truthful.  Thank you.
B000002OX7|5.0|so many hall of fame songs. you can rock out on all the tunes and still feel the touching and meaningful lyrics of Pete Townsend.Brilliant lead vocals by Roger Daltrey and out of this world drumming by the one and only legendary Keith Moon.A must have by all music fans not only rock and roll lovers.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Best book. I can't wait for the movie. The first book and movie was really good. I didn't really get the ending but whatever.....
B005LW5J9O|5.0|The Swerve is an<br />excellent introduction to the history of Epicurianism. It's the kind of book you don't want to end.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|WOW WOW WOW.....a great story.....amazing characterization......first book I have read by this author and I am ready to move right on to another.....
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|One of the best in-context reviews of first century Palestine culture I have ever read.  A very valuable source for the environment when Christianity was invented.
0446343129|4.0|I'm hoping to finish this book soon. So I can't honestly give a review.I ordered it because I heard it was excellent.
B0022Q8CSC|5.0|After seeing the movie more times than I can count, I really enjoyed reading the original.  The movie is very similar to the book offers a little more back story to the characters such as Jonny Fontaine and Luca Bratsi.  I especially liked the back story to Luca.
B005QYKE2Y|4.0|When one sits back to be part of reality dispelling, you generally know what you ate getting.  Michael Bay's brand of big action direction, Shia Lebouf and his boyish charm, the wisdom that comes from the vocal chops of Hugo Weaving and a host of side characters that enhance the overall effect. Dark of the Moon delivered that with a bit more color in language tone and edginess.  Entertainment still comes through. I enjoyed.
B0029QRA1U|5.0|Now I can save all my old LP's forever ! The ION is so easy to use, (I have a iMac), plug it in, load the software and your on your way to saving all LP's. The bonus is you get to listen to records you haven't played for years. I was amazed at the sound quality you can't  tell that it's been copied from a record. The only thing I wished was that there was a pause so you can turn the records over and keep recording on the same list, but that not a biggy just a thought. If you want to listen your old anywhere you go this is it, I load them on my iPod, record on to CD's. Way Cool !!!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Here is a story that reached out to the readers before the headlines.  Real headlines reveal the real Threat Vector.<br />A must read for every Clancy fan.
B0013LPS7K|5.0|With the original UK cover restored, this LP disk can be framed. For some bizarre reason, the original photos of the band on the back of this cover were posterized, b+w, and stretched to make an unrecognizable cipher for the US release cover art. It is a great disk, quick, safe and secure delivery. And I thank you.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Similar to the eBay layout I see on my computer, but more difficult to navigate. I was unable to pay for two &#34;buy it now&#34; items I won recently because the seller invoiced me with combined shipping. The app instructed me to go to the full version to complete my purchase.
B005HED11Y|5.0|Star Trek brings back such great memories from my youth!  This remastering is great.  The picture quality is really fantastic.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I got this game when it was offered for free and have only worked the first nine levels. The tutorial is very good. They say that each level is more difficult than the previous one, but not necessarily. They are getting more challenging as we go though.
B0036TGT2A|1.0|BEWARE of digital copy!!!!!!!!!! I just purchased Robin Hood and Sword in the Stone with the digital copies. However when I opened Robin Hood to down load it there are only two versions. Amazon streaming and VUDU.  NO ITUNES!!!!!!!!! One of the main reasons of buying was because of the digital so i could download onto my Ipad and take anywhere etc.. Don't get me wrong I love both these movies but what Disney has done with digital is SOOOO WRONG! If you want an ITunes version you have to pay again for it again.
B00AHJL7BK|3.0|Different and challenging game, sort of on the order of Soduko, but it frustrates me that I can't solve even the easiest levels. Still, I keep going back and trying...
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Like it says 5 Stars!!! Love the whole story, Music was great and acting was good too. =  ) Nice surprise!!! =  )

B00CWY76CC|1.0|Sounded like a fun game, but the instructions were inadequate and needed more how to operate the game than just the objective of the game - to escape.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Great-I do not have anything negative to say-all is GOOD,I have never had any problems with Facebook.thank you very much
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The detail on this game is great. I'm not one to normally play SIM games where you toil relatively at tasks, but this has a story that you follow so it's more like an rpg. Prices for items is a bit much (not that I wad gonna spend money on a free game) so you'll be playing for awhile to collect coins. But these games are for keeping you entertained on the go, and it certainly does that
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very very addicting game and just plain amazing though I can not figure out how to make friends with out facebook,which waists a lot of coins to skip. But I still love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This was one of a few season &#34;series&#34; that I thoroughly enjoyed....Couldn't wait to begin the next episode as soon as one was done
B008L1DNGI|1.0|A game that was not created for seniors.<br /> I deleted it soon afterwards.  What more can one say, if they didn't like it?
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|Note: The four star rating is a combination of both my opinion of the content of the show, and the quality of the product.<br /><br />Product Score - Three Stars<br />It's a standard dvd case box case with an unfolding cardboard pull out containing the four disks, and is printed with images of the cast members in character. The unfolding cardboard is a little inconvenient as far as removing and replacing the disks is concerned. Hopefully Netflix will fix this set up with future DVD releases.<br />However, the box design is actually kind of clever. The show's trademark image is an upside down and backwards american flag with no stars, and the box opens from the left instead of from the right like most dvd boxes, and the fold out cardboard comes out backwards as compared to most DVD boxes. I assume that is to represent the show's trademark image. This little detail might go unnoticed by many customers who purchase the product, but it's actually kind of a neat little Easter egg for those that do.<br /><br />Content Score - Five Stars<br />David Fincher is a better match for television than he was for film, House of Cards is the absolute best show on the internet. I would say it's the best show on television, but it seems as though history has been made with House of Cards, since we're getting movie quality award nominated television made by the internet streamed instantly to our home devices, whatever device you happen to use.<br />We follow the events in the life of a fictional democratic politician who felt he was cheated from his rightful place in power after the 2012 elections, after which his lust for power swings out of control as he puppeteers everybody in his life every which way as he lies and manipulates his way to the very top.<br />Kevin Spacey is given his most brilliant role yet as Francis Underwood, our unhinged, relentless protagonist. The writing is both nerve racking and humorous, the characters are frightening, the pace is consistently tense withoutrestraint, the plot is wildly unpredictable, and the thrills are infinite in this endless battle of wits.<br />For those who don't care for politics, you've never seen a political thriller quite like this.
B00338QENI|5.0|I did not like this book.  It wad to scientific an I'm not into research books.  It was a waste of time.
140006922X|5.0|I've spent 14 years researching my own film, a musical about Mary Magdalene, so I know Aslan's sources well. I included the 'Gnostic Gospels' in my research. Aslan used just the 4 canonized Gospels, altho more than 90 extant 'Gnostic' texts have been discovered recently and translated, available now, without centuries of 'amendments, excising and editing'.<br />Historian Josephus Flavius has been a primary source for his historical take on the life of Jesus. Flavius was Jewish before becoming an historian for Rome. So his recording at some point became biased in favor of the Republic.<br />I'm enjoying Aslan's book.<br />Some of his sources were mutual to mine, and I like that he has a clear idea of what the historical Jesus' life was like.<br />Our conclusions differ significantly, but the task of separating the historical person from the mythologized Christ is admirable, and should be of interest to any believer.<br />If you consider yourself Christian, or are interested in the narrative, a thoughtful and thorough investigation of just who Jesus was, and wasn't, should be incentive to read as much on the topic from modern theologians and revisionists, as new information is at last available thanks to the Nag Hammadhi library translations, with commentaries written by the great theological minds of our day. Aslan's book should be one of these books. But a thoughtful person should also be willing to delve into material that challenges their long-held beliefs.<br />Christianity is a living, breathing belief and philosophy. It must grow, change and be re-examined to remain relevant for modern life to benefit from it's teachings.<br />'Carpenter' and 'fisherman' are here treated literally, as vocations, and not as figurative translations.<br />Carpenter should be thought of as 'architect of the New Covenant' and 'fisher of men' as someone who actively attracts followers.<br />Historically, these ideas make sense to me as figurative, rather than literal descriptions.<br />The Bible can be a source of poetic prose. It is too often read and interpreted literally. This is why we get into Holy Wars.<br />How much easier would it be for modern minds to think of the Gospels as poetic prose than factual, fanciful history!<br />The idea that Jesus' mission was not well funded, that he was a poor carpenter seems, to me, the main contention I would differ with.<br />A radical, motivational rabbi/public/political figure with a large entourage would have to be well-coined to travel, and reach so many people, and the Gnostic library, hidden these 2 millennia in a cave, recently unearthed/translated in 1945 in Egypt, offers that his mission was primarily financed by the women, including Magdalene, who followed him from their own resources.<br />It is patriarchal thinking that excludes women from his story, minimizing their contribution to his cause. The historical Jesus was inclusive of all marginalized peoples.<br />I am pleased that Aslan is keeping the discussion alive and relevant for today's thoughtful reader.<br />It is important to realize that the historical person and the mythologized Christ of the Bible may be very different men.<br />Modern scholarship is showing us just how different.<br />This should not be cause for concern, but for further self-development through open discussion and continued learning.<br />This book is a great addition to your personal evolution./>The Bible can be a source of poetic prose.

B00C1S945G|5.0|As a long-time Star Trek fan, I am always happy to see TNG episodes, and I'm very happy that they're available on Amazon Prime.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|I remember my English teacher saying that every good story will have a beginning, a middle and an end. Sounds simple enough right? This book had me hooked. I loved the beginning, then the middle was even better and I stayed up late to find out what was going to happen at the end.. I had a few theories but nope! was so disappointed with the ended that when I looked at the book as a whole..it just wasn't that good. it had so much promise but just failed on the follow through.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|I'm a long-time Star Trek fan and I'm always happy to see TNG episodes. I'm very glad that they're available on Amazon Instant Video.
B00846REIS|2.0|The story line is just weird- two sexually abused people who connect through sex.  To me, it doesn't make sense to have been molested and constantly have sex and not feel any reservation about it for the most part.  I found myself wanting to read this book not for enjoyment but just it get it over with with. I was extremely disappointed with this book.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|I ordered this as part of a summer project for rainy days.  I want to show my 16 year old daughter what I consider to be some of my favorite movies from the past.  After The Shawshank Redemption we watched The Godfather.
B00BIVN82M|3.0|I've been a fan of Michael Buble's since the start, but there wasn't nothing really special about this CD at all. I rarely listen to it and when he went on tour this time I didn't feel inclined to see him in concert performing any of these tunes sorry to say.
160309007X|5.0|Worth it for any League-series fan. The ending was unexpected and amazing. In retrospect they were building up to it in the previous two books but when it happened, it was great.
B004L35GAQ|5.0|I still can't quit listening to this album! I hope they release some new stuff soon! They've got a new fan in me!
038572179X|4.0|I have now read a few of Ian McEwan's books, and Atonement was my first. Very deliberate and precise characterization that really kept me coming back to more of his books later on. He knows his characters and I get the feeling he cares about them, but he isn't always very nice to them. Makes for something that feels very realistic.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|It may be a littul expinsive but it is really good this is the best of any other bloons td peapul ho are wing playd for 2 second just dounloded and play for a hour
B00DANTYYC|5.0|Baby Boomers universally know these albums note-for-note. For just that reason, I haven't listened to them in years. A few days ago I picked up the lot, at a good price for the download. Fantastic. From early mandolin tunes to late Joe Walsh rock, these are phenomenal albums. No Household Should Be Without (NHSBW).
B00AB7HESI|3.0|It needs more peapul its a good game it may take a lot of memory but i's a great game
B006XOBFJC|5.0|This release could not be at a better price.  Not surprisingly, there is no text included. That is not a problem, since this may not be the first Ring for any purchaser.  It is far above some others, and the minor inconsistencies don't get in the way.<br />Janowski - conductor.  He does a wonderful job keeping things moving and yet taking time where needed.  Unlike Furtwangler in the studio Vienna Walkure, Janowski does not pull act one out too slowly.  The otherwise incredible Furtwangler recordings, however, have an amazingly cohesive quality that allows him to shape whole acts with incredible urgency. Janowski is very good, and the sound quality is equal to the demands of the score.  At his worst - Act one of Siegfried - he seems to plow ahead with few nuances. At his best, Act two of Walkure, he shapes the disparate sections into a moving \\"Pronouncement of Death\\" scene. (I even like the Swarowsky recording - singers, too - but not as a first choice.)<br /><br />Theo Adam - Wotan.  I saw Adam do the role, and on stage he was commanding. His voice is not a plush bass, but he manages to make considerable marks where others can't. The worst act is probably act two of Walkure. He just doesn't sing it enough. It is so parlando that it borders on Sprechgesang, which didn't really come along until Berg. Hotter with Keilberth is preferable, although George London (with Solti- R and Leinsdorf - W) is almost as good as Hotter.  Ferdinand Frantz (with Furtwangler) is a better voice than Adam but not as interesting.<br /><br />Rene Kollo - Siegfried.  His voice is not Melchior, but he manages to sing the role - both operas - very well. Suthaus (Furtwangler) is more commanding in Gotterdammerung, but in Siegfried, act one is clearly not easy.  Kollo also sings with more imagination than most heldentenors.  Jerusalem (Haitink and Levine's video) is more interesting yet, and his voice is perhaps more suited. Kollo's most pressing rival is Windgassen with Keilberth. Windgassen with Bohm or Solti is already showing fatigue.<br /><br />Jeannine Altmeyer - Brunnhilde. This starts out promisingly. Comparison to others singing \\"Ho-jo-to-ho\\" shows her strengths and weaknesses throughout the role. She has the ability to sail up to high notes - something others lack - and yet is rather weak on the bottom. Her commitment to the role is commendable, but there is a sense of strain.  Sieglinde was her usual stage role, and I think she was unwise to tackle Brunnhilde. That she still scores major points says more about the competition that space allows me here. Only Varnay and Nilsson manage to top her completely. Flagstad is great, too, but was at the end of a major career.<br /><br />Peter Schreier - Loge/Mime - The Mozartean / Lieder singer turned character tenor. It works to a point. He actually sings the roles better than almost anyone else. Svanholm as Loge always seems strained to me. And Stolze as Mime was a trial on the ears that can't be erased by the dramatic abilities.  Good show.<br /><br />Siegmund Nimsgern - Alberich - Excellent. He is up against multiple recordings by Neidlinger, who owned the role for years. Kelemenn was also marvelous in the role. Nimsgern is consistently good throughout.<br /><br />Matti Salminen - Hagen - He owned this role in two or three other versions, too. Fabulous.<br /><br />Siegfried Jerusalem/Jessye Norman - Siegmund and Sieglinde.  Also available in Levine's audio version. They sing the roles beautifully.<br /><br />Small roles - well cast, frequently with up-and-coming singers who figure in later Rings.<br />This release is not my first choice, but it is well worth the price.<br />Former gods and goddesses: Melchior is amazing, but also sometimes sagging in pitch. Modl as Brunnhilde is intelligent, moving, and always reaching for the high notes. Traubel (Met pirate)is commanding. Rysanek as Sieglinde - many recordings - always impressive. Pernestorfer as Alberich for Furtwangler - as committed as Neidlinger. (I saw him near the end of his career as Benoit in Boheme.)
B005PK57IK|2.0|We enjoyed this series at first, but then &#34;the good wife&#34; decided she was not very good at all, and became a character that we just did not like.  The show turned into having a bunch of back-plots filled with nothing but cheating, which got old.  We ended up no longer watching the series.
B003ELKNH2|1.0|i thought this was a really good buy, but when i recieved the package, it was trashed...the movie i thought was OK untill today..i am trying to watch it and it got to the 1 hr 21 min mark and stopped... i have cleaned it i have started over i have tried to skip the bad part......but<br /><br />please just send me another one
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Saw this with the family in the theater, and decided to watch it again while staying up late doing some work on the computer.  It was just as enjoyable the second time around.  Believable characters, perfect amount of action and plot development, and a bit of George Orwell to it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Watched all 3 seasons in about three weeks. This is a great show can't wait for season four.  A great drama.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Several other reviewers have gone deeply into the technical aspects of this thing so I won't spend any time there; just wanted to touch on how I use it and why I love it.<br /><br />I don't spend much time in front of the television but I wanted a simple way to send media to it from my computer without extra cables (due to a psychotic cat extra cables are bad in my house) and without having an extra computer dedicated to the television. By media I mean Netflix, YouTube, and movie files that I have stored locally. My blu-ray player can handle the first two if I want to fuss with that pain-in-the-tail remote and don't mind poor quality video from YouTube, but I hate searching/browsing using the remote and I'd rather see high-quality video if I can.<br /><br />I've used the heck out of this thing since I got it (I was one of the lucky ones who snagged it from Amazon on the first day). I have several saved playlists on YouTube and with this I can pull one up on my desktop, shuffle it, and send it over to the television where it plays full-screen and high-quality (1080p, I believe). Great for working around the house, especially since I'm currently remodeling my living room. I've opened local movie files in the chrome browser and sent them to the television as well. When this remodel is done I'll be moving my desk (and computer) out to the living room and really looking forward to being able to just send any videos over to the television so I can turn and watch them on a big screen. Critically, without a cable draped from the back of my computer over to the television. I'm looking forward to being able to send audio playlists over to the television as well (okay, it has better speakers than my computer). That app doesn't exist yet but it will soon.<br /><br />It's not a replacement for a Roku or similar but what it does it does very well. It does exactly what I needed and I honestly couldn't be happier.
B00006JDVV|5.0|A very well made movie and the cast never let me down.  A lot of young up and coming actors killing dragons.  Nothing better.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|I'm an addict for anything Mankell writes.<br /><br />Can't say much more. You either like his style or you don't.<br /><br />Sometimes it takes a while to for things to sort themselves out, but it is always worth<br />staying with a great writer.<br /><br />This review is the same for all of the books he has written.
B00BV1P8NG|5.0|The toy arrived a little later than the estimate date, but that's kind of understandable as it traveled a long distance (I'm from Brazil). Derpy is heavy and sturdy, and if you want a size comparison, she is the size of a Princess Celestia brushable. Her box has no tape, so it's easy to take her out of it and put her back.<br />My Derpy came with a \\"bruise\\" under her right eye, but that's only noticeable if you look under strong light or touch her. Other than that, she is adorable and a great addition to fans of all ages.
0307951529|1.0|I was very frustrated with the book because title isn't related to the content at all.<br /><br />All what I understood with the book is that I can start a business with very low budget. Really? All this paper for that?<br /><br />The book use this common knowledge and for some reason takes this $100 concept to tell you that with hard work even that $100 could be enough.<br />I can't believe this is serious, Don't buy it. If you do you would just read what I wrote here that $100 and your time working hard could make you own a business. Save your money! Don't buy this crap!<br /><br />For the author I would suggest to change the book name to: Work so hard that even $100 would be enough (I don't know how but it would probably work, You can call it a startup).
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The digital quality of this collection is outstanding! I have the Alien films in regular DVD format but wanted to experience them in high definition. I was fortunate enough to catch a &#34;Gold Box&#34; special on this set. I am very pleased with my purchase. The &#34;Alien&#34; series of films are great; especially  the first &#34;Alien&#34; and the second &#34;Aliens.&#34; Some pretty scary stuff. . .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its a really good game it even reminds me of other good games hoist like subway surfers ad other cool games because they are just so alike
B000UD0ESA|5.0|Another classic sc-fi film. Since my VHS is history I had to upgrade to DVD in order to keep enjoying this amazing film. One of Harrison Ford's best efforts. Now I am looking at Blu-Ray whenever it becomes available. Wonderful imagery and character deveopment.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Very good game. All that is missing is more time. Gives about 15 min. Enough time to build a small but good house. Very good electrics.
0783226063|5.0|A classic film from classic science fiction writing. Frank Herbert's masterpiece. Quality is very good and the screenplay follows the book. A  must for any science fiction buff.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is such a great book. It is so detailed and has so many details. Suzanne is such a great author and i cant wait to read catching fire
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Still one of my favorite television series.  One of few that I can watch over and over and still not get tired of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an addictive game. It is hard for me to put my tablet down. This game is a success. This game is a real time killer for whenever you are bored and have nothing else to do.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Still one of my favorite television series.  One of few that I can watch over and over and still not get tired of it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this game is very entertaining because u build anything u want and its very very fun  I would of gave 100stars Thank You MINECRAFT.
B0017I1IZA|5.0|FANtastic! I love everything about Stephanie Plum, Ranger, Joe Morelli and all the quirky characters that are in Stephanie 's life.I especially like the way she adds new characters that are just as goofy as the others. But, for some strange reason, I'm wanting doughnuts now all the time. Not good!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|This app is so legit! You can download any fricking song from youtube and make it mp3! It's awesome! I love it!!
B00684J49U|5.0|My wife likes to watch DVD's rather than streaming video, even when it is put onto TV.  Amazon is a good source, with good price and good quality DVD's.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game to play. Fast moving and keeps ones attention. Would recommend to family and friends. Enjoyable and fun to play
B002EEP3NO|5.0|This kit rocked my kid's world!  He got it for his 12th birthday and he was ECSTATIC!  Of course, he'd been asking for it for 3 years...<br /><br />My kiddo is a Lego-holic, and this was perfect for him.  He's very detail oriented.  Loved the detailed manual that came with.  He proudly showed off every step that he completed.  Took him one week to build.  Now he's begging for Death Star 2.  Oh my!
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Not as useful as I thought it would be as I have set up % of battery life to show on Kindle.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|What an awesome show!  Superior acting, fantastic costuming, great location.  Spectacular historical fiction.  Great to have our own DVD of the production.
B000002H92|5.0|This 2CD album is one of the greats, when it comes to live performances. It really gives you a sense of the era. the era of rock n roll, the early days. When the music was raw and uncut.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|If you Love Rod Stewart don't hesitate. This will not dissapoint. God Bless Him he still has what it takes to keep those hits coming.....
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I love it! One of the best books i ever read. I will definitely recommend it. This book made me cry and laughed as crazy. I Like John Green description of certain things that could be cruel but he made them funny at the same time.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great ending to a great trilogy,couldn't wait to see what happened to the strong character,Katniss .Recommend for teens and adults as well.
B00425S1H8|4.0|This device is automatically recognized on Windows 7, and no separate installer is needed.<br /><br />The price is very good compared to other devices that are available.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I dont normally review books but i just had to with this one! The story, so well written, has me still thinking about it. When faced with the many, many choices we have in life, how do we know if we made the right one? Can you look back and say, if i did that differently, where would i be now?<br />Thats what this book has me thinking. Buy it! You wont be disappointed!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Enjoy having what is on my laptop available on my Kindle for easy transport. Much better than old magazines in waiting rooms!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I like Les Miserables very much is really good since the very begining till the end ,<br />It is a wonderful picture.
1451695195|5.0|I've not completed this book yet, but what I have read (about half) is certainly food for thought.  I'm glad I purchased it.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I've been playing my husband's account for a while, finally decided to start my own. It's a good time waster.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Love ever episode. I take notes on Harvey. Forget Jesus, it's &#34;What Would Harvey Do&#34;!!.<br />If he was giving classes on what he does, I would take every one
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great family game. My 8 year old loves it and so do I. Competing is my personal favorite, my little girl loves to shop and by New equipment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was enthralled with each character; so beautifully portrayed; so Britishly understated; but with a depth of emotion that drew you into it all.  And of course, Maggie Smith stole every scene she was in...her quirky, half-smile facial expressions, and the &#34;last word&#34; bon mots were priceless!
B00BHMETKC|3.0|The movie was great but the streaming was a nightmare!  We had to reload it every few minutes.  I will not rent again from Amazon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded for my daughter to play but I admit I am having more fun playing. Definetly recommend it to everyone.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. I am amazed how they put this action filled movie together. It was great from beginning to end. I would recommend anyone that love action movies to buy the batman collection movies. I know you will not be disappointed!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I was a little hesitant to buy this game because of the IAP even though the developer claims you don't need to purchase anything to unlock the locked genes. I have bought games in the past with similar claims but it turns out that it was near impossible to progress without the IAP. Anyway, on a leap of faith I bought it anyway.<br /><br />As it turns out, you can unlock a new gene or plague each time you complete a game on normal or higher. For the genes you can keep unlocking them with the same plague as long as you complete it. I was able to unlock most of them with bacteria.  With the plague; however, you do need to complete one to unlock the next.<br /><br />Gameplay seems to be split into two stradegies. The plagues that refund DNA and the ones that do not. For the ones that refunds DNA you just devolve symptoms and wait till the world is infected then devolve everything and go full symptoms. For the ones that charges for devolve go symtoms early. Transmission and abilities are always the same. Two air, two water, two cold, two drugs<br /><br />I do have two issues but not game related. The first one was with the zombie expansion. When i bought the expansion it says it will appear on all my devices, but when i tried to play it on my tablet it asked me to buy it again. I contact Amazon about it and they responed to me within an hour and asked me to purchase it for my device and if i get charge for it they will refund me for the charge. I purchased it again and it gave me a message that i bought it already then unlocked it without charging me.<br /><br />My second issue is, I had to replace my phone and I lost all the genes and plagues i unlocked. If you pay for the locked items you get to keep them but if you unlocked them you don't so you have to weigh your option of whether you have more time or money.
B0014D6PCO|5.0|I was not into Batman growing up but after watching this one I had to get the second one! I enjoyed watching this movie. I had to watch it again and again... Just couldn't believe I been missing out.
B003VDZK8K|5.0|absolutely love this album. I love a variety of music and i must say i was rather impressed with this cd. My feet were moving :)
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app is fantastic. It really helps when I'm side tracked and want to see where it's at instead of just seeing that it's charging. I love this app!!!
B00634GHJA|5.0|I have used this app for transfers to android and pc. both execute without fail. absolutely love this one from Amazon.
