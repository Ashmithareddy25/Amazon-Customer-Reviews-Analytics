B0065GC0BA|5.0|Do yourself a favour and read this thought provoking book. I was expecting to cry as I had read some reviews before I read it. I didn't cry but was very moved.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used to love this app and used it daily.  The latest update has trashed it beyond all recognition.  Uninstalled.
B00AE5R2NO|3.0|My son loves Octonauts.  He wanted the Gup E to add to his collection.  The item is as described but is very small and not worth the price.
B007BVOEPI|3.0|I actually do not remember a single character's name from the episode I watched. It was a pleasant way to spend an hour, I may watch another episode if I have time and am bored, but... maybe not.  The most compelling scene to me was when the king's son confronts the lord's bastard,calling him a bastard and when the bastard  sneers at him and says he wouldn't understand  the king's son replies that, \\"every dwarf is a bastard to his father\\" or something like that...  But I did not see enough of this man - probably to me the most compelling character in the show- to remember his name.<br /><br />The story is okay.  There isn't anything that comes off as poorly portrayed. The acting is okay. The setting is wonderful. I like fantasy genre writing.  I just didn't immerse in any of the characters perhaps because there is no one main character.  Now that I've written all of this I guess I should watch another episode and give it more of a chance....
B004DLPXAO|5.0|If you like reading this is a must have to read any books on Kindle, I use a table instead of the phone which is to small
B001NA6096|4.0|This movie focused on the relationship of a compulsive young man and receptive young woman. The interactions and conversation's were realistic and at times uncomfortable since many of us can still remember struggling to &#34;connect&#34; with another young adult during our own lives.
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|didn't like the way you had to buy other parts of it. I deleted it as soon as I found out.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|this app cleans out the caches, all of them at once, for you and helps you get rid of apps you don't ever use. keeps my tablet nice and clean
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK!!!! I CANNOT WAIT FOR SYLVIA DAY TO RELEASE THE NEXT ONE!!!! SO GLAD THIS WASN'T THE LAST ONE!!!!
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|its a cute game but it seems to take forever to play. always needing nectar and seeds to do things but its really a battle game mostly. nothing else to do but the same type of quests over and oevr again. very nice graphics however great game for kids
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved this one. Have read it 3 times already. It does leave you hanging since now there is a 4th, but I hope it's just as good.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I enjoyed this book it was refreshing to read a book that didn't delve into fear mongering and telling you all that you are doing wrong instead it was empowering and amusing
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|google is a great application is great for any search and its great my family like it and my kids can search anything they want thank you
B004ADF7RO|5.0|my husband and I love this movie from our childhoods and now we love sharing it with our children even more.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|This app is fun for everybody! My four year old and I play it together everyday! We<br />love it! I recommend it to anyone!
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|the movie was missing so much that made the book great the characters were barely developed and the only reason i enjoyed it at all is because I knew the story from having read the book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched the first season of Downton Abbey on Netflix, then had withdrawl.  A friend mentioned Amazon Prime, and now I can watch the rest of Downton.  I love the characters (and dislike some of them), but the acting and production value are top-rate.  The costuming is brilliant.  I'm completely hooked!
B005F2BBLK|4.0|my family really enjoyed this film and for me and my husband there was enough adult humor to keep us entertained the whole way through
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I have now read all 3 of Khaled Hosseini's books. My all time favorite was The Kite Runner.  And the Mountain Echoed is a close second!  His books always pull at the heart strings and bring tears to your eyes.  I must say though ... not to give away the ending .. but I've come to expect that in his books so I was not surprised that the siblings were never able to ever truly connect.  Did find myself looking back through the book a few times to connect the family members ... that was a tad confusing.  Would highly recommend this book to any avid reader.  Couldn't put it down as I needed to know what was next.  This was a very good read!
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Has a pretty good selection of sounds and while most are not all that appealing, it did offer maybe three or four that are peaceful and relaxing. So for a freebie, I'd recommend it. I have trouble falling asleep and perhaps the wind chimes or piano will help.
030758836X|1.0|I was so excited to start this book after so many positive reviews.  However, I could barely finish the first chapter.  The language is highly offensive and the story is just plain weak.  Total downer.  I can't figure out why this book was chosen as one of 2012 top books.  Do NOT waster your time or money.
B003G4W49C|5.0|To start, I don't read much sci-fi nor am I one to read/watch/listen to something because something is popular (unless it stands the test of time).  Over the years I've seen many references to this book... both on &#34;top ten&#34; reading lists as well as on message boards discussing good literature.  I needed some kind of e-book to evaluate a Kindle I was buying, so decided to finally scratch this book off of my list.  And...<br /><br />Wow.  I read for fun and don't over-think or over-analyze the fiction I read (either for messages/themes or actual literary components).  The beauty of this book is that it *is* fun and can be a truly brain-less read.  But if you want to engage your brain and be &#34;deep&#34;, this book invites it.  The author does an amazing job of putting a number of those themes right in the forefront, but without insulting you or being preachy with a transparent agenda; you don't have to go digging for it.  Some of these themes are exposed right in the dialog between characters, some are a result of &#34;hearing&#34; the characters' thoughts, and some a result of the actual story telling (e.g. when explicitly switching between the kids' and adults' views).  You don't *have* to think... nothing in the actual plot is lost, but it's hard *not* to actually think about it.  It's been over a week since I read it, and I'm still thinking about it.<br /><br />There are few books that can actually send a shiver down my back; this is one of them.  As a result, this is now my second favorite book ever... only behind (a sci-fi, coincidentally) Contact.  If there is any weakness in the book, it is the last chapter or two.  They aren't bad at all, but the &#34;holy ****, did that just happen?&#34; moment when you get to the spine-shivering climax gets diluted by the end of the book.  The closing chapters are, I'm assuming, critical in setting up the other books in the series, but the impact of that moment gets lost a little bit.<br /><br />So all-in-all... excellent book.  Easy to read, plenty to think about, many surprises that you can see coming (and in spite of that, still impactful), and an awesome twist (not in the &#34;we're going to lead you down a false path then pull the rug from under you, leaving you small clues along the way so you know afterwards how we tricked you&#34; sense, but in the &#34;that's actually the most logical ending, but I just didn't see it coming&#34; sense; there is no trickery involved).  Pleasurable, but I still can't decide if it's a happy, sad, or scary story.<br /><br />(Note: I see the author has been in the news lately for &#34;unpopular&#34; viewpoints which coincides with a new movie coming out based on the book.  My purchase, reading, and thoughts of this book occurred before knowing all of this.  Even though I'm writing this after hearing the news, my thoughts on the book itself were not influenced at all (positively or negatively).  It's just a coincidence that Amazon invited me to review it right after those events.)
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I've just started but I've used no real money so I don't know how that will effect later evolution. Right now I am satisfied. Action is quite good as well
B001NHNG64|5.0|Love the fact that the &#34;good guy&#34; always wins...just a matter of finding out how! Learn something new with every volume-
B00846REIS|4.0|i like the books but i do think that she is prolonging the story more than it needs to be prolonged. Also she spends a ton of pages describing how Gideon looks in a suit from behind. Too many times. Also i dont like the name Gigion.<br /><br />I have to say i read all the 50 shade books and the story caught me from the begging, this one i kind of wanted to stop reading it but my coworker kept telling me it would get better but i am not inlove with the characters and the story as much as i was with 50 shades. good read after all i guess.
0425264351|5.0|I especially enjoyed reading Lee Child's description of his creative process. The result is highly entertaining, though more gory than many of my friends can tolerate!
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I'm in the 30 percent that enjoy James' work.<br /><br />If I could master one concept talked about in the book it would definitely be the \\"Daily Practice.\\"<br /><br />I hope to master the concepts and teach it to my two baby girls.<br /><br />I don't like rating things perfect out of perfect... because nothing is ever perfect.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|My husband, a big Die Hard fan, wanted to see this, so we did. We both regretted it. John McClane arrives in Russia to rescue his son, with whom he hasn't spoken  in years and who seems to be in big legal trouble. A cab driver sings \\"New York, New York.\\" McClane gets there right in time - to interrupt his son, who turns out to be a CIA spy in the middle of a mission. Ooops. John and Jack McClane don't get along, but reluctantly team to chase bad guys and make things explode. An hour and a half passes, Bruce Willis says \\"I'm on vacation\\" a bunch of times, and there's a pastel-colored montage of a happy family at the end.<br /><br />Yes, it's all as bad as it sounds. If you like John McClane and the Die Hard movies, do yourself a favor: stay away from this one.
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This was a wonderfully complex drama that explores the relationship between dreams and reality without completely confusing the viewer. Couple that with great acting and fantastic visual effects and the movie becomes an engrossing piece of entertainment that engages the mind while dazzling the eye.
0804165734|5.0|I would highly recommend this audiobook to anyone. The cast was awesome and I actually wish it were longer(it's already 10 CDs long). It makes me want to see the movie.
B008W14ZD2|5.0|If you love owl city's happy up beat music with lovable corny lyrics definitely give it a listen you won't be disappointed.
B004C3DLJS|5.0|I had heard that this was the best of the 3 but I was not prepared for how really excellent it is. I would recommend this to anyone of any age. Young children and rather old people (like me) can enjoy it together. It is a remarkable story told in a very entertaining way. I have worked in the computer industry for almost 40 years and I still am amazed and delighted by CGI. This movie uses it to it's best effect. This is one movie that you should watch and have in your library.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|the story really made me want to read more and more. havent read a book like this in a while
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This is a surprisingly good movie. I have not read the book but would like to now. I had read some very critical reviews of this movie but I have to say I thought the movie was very well acted, filmed, and directed. It is one of those movies that you need to see again - and you want to see it again. It is a 5 star movie in my opinion
B0058W74UY|1.0|you need to say it not available on kindle.  I wasted my money buying something that does not on kindle. it should not download if you cant use it.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A member of my immediate family was an alcoholic so this movie may have meant more to me than to others. I thought it was one of the most important movies that has been produced in a while. It tells the story without varnish and without apology. It is rough in spots, though. The first 5 minutes features full nudity so be forewarned. The crash scene, while somewhat preposterous, is very, very riveting! The first 30 minutes ranks right up there with Saving Private Ryan. It is a great movie with a very important message but, perhaps, not for everyone. Just one note - notice especially the conversation in the stairwell at the hospital. Very, very powerful.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Tilt mode needs to have an option for brakes in the top corners where my thumbs actually are when playing.<br />Also needed is a half-speed beginner's mode.  Once you begin to memorize the course it becomes playable and each car drives differently but just like the real thing in sand because I have driven my raised Toyota 4x4 at Pismo Beach.<br />It is remarkably just like the real thing.  It is my current favorite game.
B00AQ2G7D6|4.0|Great old movie with alot of action !  Fun to have access to such old movies and see the actors once again !
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Love it,this is a pretty cool game. The update is awesome now we have a glacier.  Thanks Ludia for a great app.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Interesting, in that I learned things I didn't know about the pharmaceutical industry and Parkinson's all wrapped up in a good well written movie. It doesn't hurt that the actors are easy on the eyes either.<br /><br />It's more weighty than the &#34;blurbs&#34; about it led me to believe, but rather than being disappointed I was pleased. Definitely entertaining, thought provoking, and worth the time, it has fun in it too. But I would NOT call it a comedy.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is awesome and scary but in a good way... People should get this game if they like scary games
B001RTSPVY|5.0|This is NOT a happy show. This is NOT a funny show...but if you can stomach the bitter side of life, it's a great show.<br /><br />So often poignant and painful, but fascinating in it portrayal of humanity and the ways in which wanting to do right can go so very wrong.
B006TLFIAQ|2.0|Warning SPOILERS! Killer Elite boasts a terrific cast, a decent budget, and a case where clearly the WHOLE is less than the sum of its parts. The biggest problem is the storyline is so stupid and ridiculous that it leaves the viewer with no one to care about. Good guys killing good guys to help a terrorist get revenge.Please!!!!!! Why couldn't a plan be constructed simply to free the one hostage, with all the resources these guys had at their disposal and Statham's character disinterest in money??? Instead they go off and kill SAS soldiers who serve their country. The whole premise was such a bunch of ultra left wing horse manure and a waste of an opportunity to make an excellent film. Is this type of pandering to the \\"we hate the Military\\" crowd necessary to get a film financed these days? Pathetic.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|God I wish Stanley Kubrick was still around to make movies.  This guy know how to develop characters with believeability.  Supurb.  A must watch.
0743297334|5.0|Like most of us, I had Hemmingway forced on my in high school. Old Man and the Sea was the penance paid for some grievance I and the rest of my classmates must have committed. It didn't have sex, hot rods or music. I didn't care for it much. So anyway, years later for whatever reason I decided to give Papa another try. So I picked up \\"The Sun Also Rises\\".  What a pleasant and wonderful book. The prose overall is masculine. Hemmingway doesn't bother with feelings, hues or ornamentals.  He tackles the story straight-forward with no frills. The writing style I found to be quite refreshing. Here was a man's man talking like a man. The story itself plodded but set the tone for the trip to Spain where the book picks up the pace. Through the story, I could start to pick up on the subtle of things Hemmingway was writing but not saying outright. It was very human and through the facade of masculinity, very touching. I absolutely loved the book. Now I know why my teachers forced Old Man and the Sea on me all those years ago.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am enjoying spending time on this game.  It's a lot better than 100 Floors! It's. a good idea to have a notepad handy.
1451662432|3.0|I checked this book out of my local library and it seemed like it took me forever to read it. Arnold is a nice guy, smart and sensible but his bullheaded when it comes to politics and those sections about when he was governor seemed to take forever to reach. The only thing i do not like is that he did not really explain why he cheated on maria with their housekeeper. He just says its something stupid that he did. Ya, no kidding their arnold.
1490313370|5.0|Choose Yourself reads like you're having an authentic conversation over coffee with James. It's light, straight forward and easy to relate to.<br /><br />The book has value not because it offers intricate philosophies, but the book is valuable simply because it outlines three essential areas about daily life that can bring us joy and happiness. Ironically, these are the ones we tend to forget.<br /><br />1.- A true warrior is never at war with the world. And it takes this understanding to begin a revolution with one self.<br /><br />2.- We are our worst enemy. Self-sabotaging is probably the cruelest traits man can display. It's a dark plot that we secretly plan against ourselves. Yet, most of us are experts at self-sabotaging. UNLEARN YOURSELF is another way to describe this book. Press the backspace key and let that mouse pointer erase everything you've written about yourself so far.<br /><br />3.- There's nothing more important than the cultivation of yourself through deep spiritual convictions which can be applied to your daily world. Cultivation of yourself by loving yourself can bring freedom to be who you truly are. Only then true and deep happiness will come. The magic happens when we approach the world trusting ourselves and stop chasing shiny objects. Love yourself enough to hear yourself.<br /><br />Choose yourself. Love yourself. The Lotus flower did.<br /><br />You can read the full review here: [...]
B0029LCJJS|4.0|An intimate look at a tumultuous time in history.  Story and acting was great.  A bit too much gratuitous blood and gore.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Great price on the set. The set is so large that if you lose your page it is hard to find it again.
B0012HF5NC|5.0|Has become a family tradition to watch on the 4th of July.  President's speech reminds you it is ok to be proud to be an American.
B0026O475M|4.0|great movie Tom Hanks is outstanding as usual. and so was Mr. Wilson. Ha! Ha!He needs to keep making same type of movies
B00CWV9FQA|3.0|Mildly entertaining feature. The Kids like it.  I watched it twice to see if it was worth a purchase, and to me, it is not.<br /><br />Enjoy
B002DEZXOE|4.0|I enjoyed three days of mud blood and beer and then some. The Music was great and never will be the same again.
0345529057|5.0|So far I'm 3/4 of the way through the first book and am really enjoying it. The book, with the exception of just a very few minor incidents is exactly like the beloved HBO series, GOT.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Have always been a fan of Bruno Mars...what can I say about explicit language, I am an adult and know where the skip button is on my stereo.
B004FQX59I|5.0|Oliver Stone comes through again in stellar fashion in this drama documentary of sorts.  Makes you wonder exactly who was behind the JFK assasination and why.  A must see for historians, JFK and Costner fans alike.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Good afternoon movie. Funny. Before watching the movie it would be better to watch captain America, iron man, the incredible hulk, Thor movies. That way you have a better idea of the movie
0061950726|2.0|I'll start out by saying that what upset me most--the cruelty and abuse inflicted on the children of the orphan trains--is my problem, not the author's.  I no longer have the stomach to read about children being raped, starved and legally used as slaves, and I should have known what I was getting in to when I read the description.  The author based her book on things that really happened, and I simply need to learn to stay away from this kind of book.<br /><br />However, there are things the author could have done to make this book better than it was.  The relationship between the two main characters took way too long to develop, especially for a 273 page book.  If the two women had shared their stories with each other, rather than just with the reader in the first two thirds of the book, there would have been genuine heartwarming, uplifting breaks in the otherwise endless stream of pain and injustice the characters endured.  Instead, I just felt like I was enduring it, too.<br /><br />Also, none of the bad guys were ever brought to justice, or even confronted with what they did.  That too, may be simple reality, but in a novel, the author has the chance to give the reader--and her characters--at least a little satisfaction.  This was sadly lacking in Orphan Trains.
1452115567|5.0|I love the story of Maddie and Theron.  This is a great book about companionship and discovery, and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a lighthearted addition to their collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very enjoyable!  Not so hard that u couldn't do the levels,  but not so easy either!  Will look forward to new levels in the future!
0316227706|5.0|I bought this book for Father's day.  My family has had several black labs through the years, and one knows how much a lab loves water!  This book includes amazing photos of all types of breeds and their underwater adventures.  I highly recommend this book for anyone who is an animal lover and is looking for a fun addition to their book collection.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun game! Looking forward to reaching levels! Challenging!  Have been waiting for this to come for Kindle! Gad that it is here!
B00BF124PC|4.0|Would have liked to see one half of the movie tracking UBL down and the other half the Seal Team Six training and finally the mission to take him out. Just a bit more Action :)
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|&#34;I don't want to buy my clothes from Ann Taylor Loft!!&#34;  Hilarious, uncomfortable, heartwrenching.  Apatow pulled this one from his gut.  I think this movie was very brave, the performances were incredible and inspired. Want to see it again.
B00BQH9SY0|4.0|This album has some great tracks like Sweater Weather and Female Robbery. This band reminds me of a little Coldplay, Gorrillaz, Massive Attack, mixed in. I enjoyed this album. Good purchase.
B0017VT5E8|4.0|I must have watched Rocky 10 times in the theater as a 12 year old.  I remember loving this movie so much and it being a huge deal because the story of it's creation was such an underdog success.  I'm not sure it holds up over time, my 13 year old was bored to tears.  I still enjoyed watching it.  The production value is rough, and the acting is mostly amateurish,  but the cinematography is beautiful, showcasing the grittiness of one of my favorite underdog cities.  Still love you, Rocky.
B004WJREMW|4.0|The album is good with Waterfalls, and the closing track are beautiful, along with the very catchy Coming Up, but the real gems are the 10 minute each mind blowers on the bonus disc Secret Friend & All You Horse Riders/Sway. Also, the newer updated version Blue Sway with orchestration is really nice as well.The man is an absolute marvel.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|All of the killing of the animals make it rather hard to watch. While the story is interesting, it wasn't interesting enough to make it an overall enjoyable experience.
B0081336FO|5.0|I only wish there were more episodes, but then it would take up even more of my life. If you love mystery shows, you will love this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Love this book! Great book to purchase! I will definitely read this book over again and tell all my friends to read it as well.
B00993I6D2|4.0|A film everyone should watch at least once in their lifetime and a really solid adaptation of the book.<br /><br />Definitely recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I downloaded this game last nite and I cant stop playing it. its good for all ages. I definantly recommend. Have fun!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The movie started a little slow and I didn't know if I was going to like it. From about 15 minutes in though I was sold. I cannot wait to see DM2!
B009WO7NQO|4.0|Great game! If you are a trekkie you will love this game of challenge. When the app first appeared I was not very impressed and did not play.  Actually I stopped playing all the angry bird and bad pig games, they were all the same! Then someone told me they had improved the angry bird star wars and I tried again. I found it much more challenging and found you actually had to THINK to figure out the results of some layers. I am sure you will like this upgraded game!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a fun and exciting game.  It is different beacause you discover different soldiers. I have enjoyed playing Epic the game.
B003DT19F0|5.0|How can you not love Tinkerbell?!  All her movies are great, and this is no exception.  I bought it for my daughter, but I found myself stuck to the screen watching it too.  Very cute and something to watch over and over.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I installed mode of this game with unlimited money and life's  ,after 6 hours in the game I understood. that the game never ends and designed only suck moneys from gamer. I advice for everybody don't waste real money for it....
B00275EHJG|4.0|This is not my favorite Toy Story.  It was cute though, but not as entertaining, to me, as the past two.  My kids agreed.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Cannot say enough about how much we enjoyed this series. Would recommend it to anyone. Also ordered a book about the subject matter.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|So i played this on my friends kindle and was like wwwoooooowwwww as o i downloaded this and it really good shout to tobuscus bless ur face
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game for killing time. This is similar to 100 floors but it seems a bit more fun. I was able to reach the tenth floor in a few minutes after downloading the app. Hopefully new levels will become available very soon. I would gladly continue playing, so please keep the levels coming.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A very powerful story. I don't usually like books written in 1st person nor am I CRAZY about YA genre, but I could NOT put this book down. I cried, I laughed, I couldn't get enough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging but not impossible. I look forward to more rooms soon. I recommend trying this game. Awesome that it is free but would have a good review even if I had paid for it.
B00B7IJBUY|5.0|I am a major Bon Jovi fan, and this is a bit of a departure but I love the sound. Played it almost non-stop the first couple of weeks that I had it.
B00C2VGAW2|5.0|It was mostly everything everything I'd imagined, minus a few songs from the movie.  I listen to it in my car all the time!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun. Challenge your thinking process with this game. Each room is different. Colorful and we'll thought out. I have already recommended this game to a friend. The fact that it is free is a bonus.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the 30 Day Shred. It's a good stand-by when I can't get out to run due to weather. It will make you sweat so good!
B003NS0PT2|5.0|this is probably one of the better episodes of this show...you will laugh at some of the physical comedy in this one...This is one of the better shows on tv today...
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|good for age 5years on up. good for working out problem/solving-concentrating on task at hand, but graphics-different scenarios fun for all-and most important, keeps your lil ones busy on long road trips
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|This USB 3.0 Hub is very compact and gives really fast speed. Compatible with USB 2.0 also. This priced is perfectly priced. Will recommend it to others.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|First class acting to the point you think of the cast as a real family --great plot -- plenty of drama -- great entertainment
B001JV5BIA|5.0|The dvd description of this movie makes it far more serious than what it actually is. This film doesn't belong in the same category as Saw and Hostel. The violence in this film is mild compared to horror flicks I've seen lately. This movie is actually light. Also, I loved the fact that the movie was cut, dry, and straight to the point. No flat moments and no excessive length. I remember I was too scared to watch this movie because I thought it would be too much. I laughed at myself when I finished the film. Last House is now in my personal favorites collection. I really enjoyed it.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Great start to this book series.  Martin hooks you from the start.  I bought the first book rather than the package of the first two not being sure I would like it,  but have now bought all five books.  Quite enjoyable for lovers of the fantasy genre.
B00003CXI1|5.0|I have this movie on VHS but I have no VCR player.  I have been searching for it on DVD for cheap, and finally found it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Once again Connelly carries you on a trip thru his life and experiences.  Very hard to put down and sorry when it ended.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It  is the best game ever you get to use your imagination to build a legitimate structure it is the bomb
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Better than the Thor...Captain American movies....great dialog. I could even 'see' some of the comic book format...in some of the poses...and yes Stan Lee is there!

0307165485|4.0|I bought this book so I would have 1 book that I could read to my grandkids when they come over to visit.  It has so many stories short and long that hold their interest.  The pictures are great as well
B009M2T7K6|5.0|Very pretty, but the tail fin is only really pretty on one side (it is the same with the fairy in this style). The fabric is pretty under the  plastic but the back side of the tail fin is plain and you can see where the fabric is attached, I think it would have been nicer if they made it two sided.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|I love all the transformers Movies they are so cool and entertaining.<br />can wait for another installment. love the special effect's
0375869026|5.0|I read this out loud to my 7 year old.  It's a beautifully written book and does a great job teaching, by example and not preaching, about bullying and empathy.  I think it really had an effect on my son and we were both sad when the book was over.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I read this because it was available for free and I wanted to see how it differed from the movie.  Myself, I prefer the movie but there is something very magical and imaginative about this book that would be great for bedtime storybook reading.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Good script, very realistic depiction of the separation of classes, et alia.  Cannot wait until season 3 to be available
B00CIS1OKW|4.0|This is a fun movie for the whole family...but with some eyeballs popping out & heads being chopped off, it isn't for the squeamish.
B007S3S8HO|5.0|Our son loves Angry Birds, games, toys, shirts, etc.  This product fits right into his large collection.  Good price too.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Maybe I'm not qualified to make that statement because I have not read all of his works, especially the Sandman series, but in many ways, I think this is Neil's &#34;The Old Man and the Sea. Compared to American Gods and Anansi Boys, it is very short, 240 pages, or so, but it accomplishes a great deal in a short space.<br />It is told in first-person, a seven year old boy, and the reader never feels that the boy is speaking beyond his years. Yet the events in the story are well beyond his years. The story takes place in rural post-war England. The first chapter and into the second are fairly mundane and then, in the space of a sentence or two, the author kicks it up, sets the hook, and never lets the reader go. Masterful writing. Masterful storytelling. The two, often, do not go hand-in-hand. He takes elements other writers have written of, even Neil himself, and gives them a fresh telling, a more perceptive telling, and one that is satisfying without being sugary or happily-ever-after.<br />Maybe the book is not for everyone, but for anyone with a mystical bone in their bodies, even if it's the funny-bone, get it, read it, you will not be disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We are hooked on this series.  It is so entertaining and the people are actually nice to their employees.  How refreshing to watch a show without swear words.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very addicting, awesome challenges, cannot wait until there are more rooms added. So much fun. Only wish it had lasted longer.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|This is a wonderful book for Summer. I just read it in a week and I enjoyed it very much. I could not put it down.Very easy and fluent language. I also bought \\"The Notebook\\" by the same writer.

B00CMYRSQG|4.0|This is without a doubt there best album yet. I like all there albums by them. And being a huge fan of leveler, I wasnt sure what direction they would go after leveler. We'll this album definetly tops leveler its amazing. It has some of the leveler feel to it. But the awesome thing is it has all abr in it old and new. Theres something for all true fans. I feel like they couldnt have made a better album after leveler outstanding job guys. But the one problem I have with it is the production could of been better before they released it. Ever since constellations  there albums production has gone down at least I think so. Which is why I decided to give it a four star. Nonetheless its just in incredible album by them, definitly my new favorite and I would say its seriously contending to be metal album of the year.

0785153942|4.0|First let's address some things mentioned on some other reviews:<br />-Quality of the art work - I haven't read a lot of comic books and/or graphic novels, but I have read several, about a dozen or so.  The art work here at least as good of most I've see else were.  It doesn't knock it out of the park, but doesn't suck; it's middle of the road, and there's nothing wrong with that.  I can read everything clearly, in just a second or two I can pick out all the relevant information from each panel so as not to disrupt the flow, but there is enough detail that I can really dig into most of the panels for more.<br />-Nudity - There really isn't.  There is one panel in which a character is in the shower, her arm covers anything that might be \\"risqué.\\"  There are also a few (three I think, I'm not positive on the number) of scenes of pilot's minds connected to control the Jaeger.  This is shown with a commonly used ethereal, out-of-bodyesque dream state; and is typical for these types of shots done nude, i.e. clothes don't show up in the mind's eye (although, apparently eyeglasses do).  Here either arms/legs, hair, or mist like shadows cover everything.  Your typical beach shows just as much (or more) skin.<br /><br />Now the good:<br />This is an interesting look into the early days of the Kaiju Wars.  You get to see some of the back stories for several characters and concepts.  As the introduction to the book states, any good fictional universe should be as expansive and real as our own.  This book shows a peak into some of that.<br /><br />The bad:<br />-- NOTE: This is a minor complaint at worst, in some way (read on and you'll see what I mean) it's even a plus --<br />This book is short.  You can read it in about a half an hour.  In some ways that's okay, it leaves you both wanting to know more and knowing that there is more here that can eventually be found.  That's what makes for a really good supplementary material/expanded universe, the knowledge that there is more to the universe that just \\"the story.\\"
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is one of the only games you will ever play.It is entertaining and fun to build stuff and fight monsters.It takes awhile to update like two weeks on my Kindle Fire HD but I still love it!!!
B005LAII80|5.0|So unexpectedly good! It's also one of the best 3D movies I've ever seen. 3D was used to tell story better than Avatarded. HIghly highly recommended. Hope they make a sequel!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|absolutely love the game, have it on my iphone and when I saw it was available on the kindle I needed to download it. only problem I have with it is that sometimes it gets delayed and has some bug problems.
B00340O3KQ|5.0|non stop action and a cool story line. definitely give this a thumbs up. Nic Cage and Travolta were the perfect combo for a movie like this
B009RH9FR6|4.0|Way better than my original case. Can manipulate to fit any position you need to see screen. It doesn't seem very protective, but has been good for me.
B004PGO25O|5.0|I found this book to be extremely helpful when venturing to start a new, more fulfilling career.  Naming and understanding all of the faces of resistance have proven powerful in the pursuit of reaching my goals.  It is a quick, easy read that will change your life forever. Do the work.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Way different from the movie (obviously). Not so much of a kids story anymore though. Really enjoyed this and plan on purchasing the entire series soon.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Who would have figured that Clinton loved Nixon, or how close Hoover and Truman were. This book gives a better historical look at the post presidencies of these great men and their continued contributions behind the scenes.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I haven't been able to keep up with the series on TV due to my work schedule, so this is the best way for me to stay with the story. I hope they don't stop producing the series on DVD, otherwise I'm in trouble! (And so is my series collection.)
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Excellent program, love the music, love the characters, love Broadway.<br />I really want more of Smash.  Watched three times and like it more each time.<br />Thanks for a wonderful series.
B007PT1PEY|3.0|I like this colloberation, I'm just not into this genre as much as I thought I would be. Maybe some day I will be more interested in it, but I recommend this edition for those interested in English mystery/murder stories.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|closes after only a few seconds. I have un installed and re installed it many times and still the same problem. bummed
0425263924|3.0|Warning, there will be spoilers for the first two books in this review.<br /><br />I liked the first Crossfire book, I didn't love it, but I appreciated it for what it was. The second book however I didn't like. At all. Eva went from being this damaged yet strong character to just this mat that Gideon walked all over. Plus she was whiny and super annoying. I seriously debated whether I should read the third book, but I figured I wanted to know how it ended.<br /><br />When I first started this one I wasn't sure I was going to be able to finish. I find the whole murdering your girlfriend's rapist really disturbing. I get that Gideon had good intentions, but I just don't know if I could be with someone who planned and carried out an elaborate murder.<br /><br />Plus, and I'm sure I'm in the minority here, I don't understand what's appealing about Gideon. He seems to have no personality besides being dark and broody. And that just doesn't work for me. As this book went on I liked how we saw more of Eva and Gideon just being together, not necessarily having ridiculously passionate sex, but just talking and hanging out.<br /><br />Eva was also much more tolerable in this book. Her backbone grew back and I found myself really rooting for her. I do wish Cary would take a long walk off a short bridge and Eva's mother I just want to slap.<br /><br />Overall I thought this was an improvement from the second book and maybe slightly less in quality than the first book. I was kind of annoyed when I learned this wasn't the final book and I'd have to read another book(s?) to figure out the conclusion of Eva and Gideon's story. But by the end the book had won me over and I was ok with it
B0094BB4TW|5.0|i like facebook. i wish every body had this like i do because it is great. please get one. have a good day.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I love this movie and am glad I was able to get it before it went back into the vault.

B001F7MSG6|3.0|I love this movie but it came in a generic clear box with no second disc and had a small scratch. The movie played fine but I wanted the actual box and special features.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Then game was very engaging and I look forward to the next game. I enjoyed the puzzles and the graphics were great.
B004UFEJVW|5.0|A very warm and touching movie that my family loved. You could even say it was uplifting!<br />Three more words.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I'm a grown up - and I suppose that this book was never intended to suck me in the way it did!! I was looking for an easy read during my summer off, but I never expected the drama, energy & twists!
B00000I0XW|5.0|What Lovely voice - and the music of Andrew LLoyd Webber is so engaging.<br />Sarah Brightman's voice has such a sweet and pure timbre.  It is a pleasure to listen to this recording.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|It was happy it had beautiful music nobody gets hurt or killed wish I could find a place like that to retire to
B006L4MWVE|5.0|The title of this review pretty much sums it all up.<br /><br />&#34;Battle Royale&#34; is not a Hollywood production, yet it proves to be more shocking, and more disturbing, than &#34;The Hunger Games&#34;.<br /><br />Is it a more terrifying vision of our children's future than &#34;Class of 1984&#34;?  No, not really.  But is it worth watching?  Yes.  Yes it is!
140003180X|5.0|I love, love, love the #1 Ladies Detective Agency series. The characters are so real and the story lines are very interesting without being frightful. Alexander McCall Smith, keep on writing.
B0049J2BSM|5.0|It was funny and I just loved the movie for how short it was so that is why I'm givin it 5 stars.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Quite an enjoyable film. Loved the setting in India, the characters and the plot. Whenever Judy Dench always adds her talent to a film, it must be a winner.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is wonderful! I loved it so much, it only took me 7 hours to read! It sucks you in on an adventure worth going on. The way Ransom Riggs set the story up is amazing!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|....so why did they &quot;fix&quot; it!  What a disaster! Please bring back the &quot;old&quot; version. I never had a problem with it and I'll miss it. It looks like I'll be looking for something else. I guess this app will be headed for deletion.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|There has been a great deal of excellent research on the topic of habits - why and how we acquire them; ways to change them; how habit differs from addiction.  This book gets there in the end, but goes too far with too little data.  This is primarily a self help book with a single conclusion, that habits are the most important aspect of life with the power to drive personal success and organizational success.  The examples suffer from the fallacy of concluding from success: ie this person was successful and it is all because they understood the power of habit management.  The implication is then reversed to conclude that if you manage habits you will be successful, but of course there are an enormous number of examples of successful habit management not leading to success - none of these are recounted here.<br /><br />A disappointment, overstating the case and thereby failing to carry the argument. 62% through I just had to stop reading out of frustration.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|its like a iman you can control with your finger something to do while you wait for the next movie
0062255657|5.0|This is a story about our inner child. If you still have it, you'll understand. If you've lost it, you might find it back after reading the story. Either way, there's not guarantee that you'll keep it. Being an adult and life get in the way sometimes ..
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Beautiful movie. I loved this movie so much. I remember sneaking into theater in 94 to see it. Glad to finally get it on blu ray. This movie forever makes me sad because of Brandon Lee. Still one hell of a movie.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I use mahjong as a wake-up for those times you find yourself staring off into space.  There are some really quick little layouts here that will get you going again without sucking you in to a real mind wringer.<br />Nice tiles that you really have to look at close to match up.  Cheap 5 minute energy.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|I don't get why this didn't have more fans. I just loved it. I have watched it so many times. I love Danny Mcbride and James Franco in this so much. The casting was superb with lady loves played by Zooey Dechanel and Natalie Portman. The villain Lezar played by Justin Theroux was just such a creepster. Come on! It was seriously a favorite screenplay of mine. It is so funny and weird. I can't believe I waited so long to get Blu-ray. I was so hoping for a sequel but I am sure it aint ever going to happen. Oh well.
B0026IUXO2|4.0|beautiful cinematography. cate blanchett is gorgeous and does a fine job of portraying the young Elizabeth. Supporting actor preformances were superb.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Fun fun movie. Looks super great on blu ray. Definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. Funny, sweet, action packed. Love all the scenes with him and Jane (Natalie Portman). Favorite part is where he talks to Jane about Hoo-ble(Hubble) telescope and describes the Heavens. So fun!! Ending is so good cannot wait for the sequel.
B0015F1VY8|3.0|don't get me wrong, i love cate blanchett, but something about this  movie had a cheesy over acted quality to it. some of the music was a bit too boiler plate action flick as well. costumes, as usual for the Elizabeth movies, were awesome.
B00821OX98|4.0|I love the show, it reminds me of the Walking Dead, except it feels like that show is falling apart. I'm hoping this show doesn't do that.  The characterization of the Mason family is great, and I'm excited for all the potential that the plot retains while still providing really  interesting episodes.  I'd really like for more characterization of any and all characters beyond just the suffering that's occurred and the taboo and vague relationship between Moon Bloodgood and Tom Mason.  But it's a great show in a time that we're flooded with post-apocalyptic television, and I reccommend it to everyone who asks.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Since I had my fire, I have been depending on this app first thing in the morning and several times during the day. Suddenly the format changed to a much less useful version. Some of the info is lost in other pictures and navigation is much more difficult. I just want the weather from this - not a bunch of videos
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I like that the story of their normal lives was made to seem different but also quite similar to the average sixteen year olds day. Also the way the two fell in love was a bit cheesy but good because it was meant to be that way.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game but the game but it kept on freezing multiple times so I had to un install and re install it to my kindle fire and it still will not work
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This show is written and acted very well.  The first two seasons are the best of the whole series.  I recommend.
B000FTWB7G|5.0|I loved every song on album. It was definitely worth the price for the album. Excellent styles, and variety of styles on album which make the album great.
B00D23K0MU|5.0|I love every CD Maysa puts out but I think this one is my favorite I enjoyed every cut on this cd you go Maysa!
B005PK1G76|5.0|Finally, I found something that fits the City select. It is on the small side, but doesn't interfere whith folding the stroller and very sturdy for daily use.
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I loved every song! I really enjoyed this cd Joe is back! Can't wait for the concert in Baltimore or DC.
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|I have used this product for one week, and have been able to achieve deep, restful sleep. Mr. Johnson's voice is calming & relaxing, and the scripting & techniques used throughout provide an almost hypnotic message.  Good adaption of mind/body relaxation instructions.  I have heard the entire message only once & that was during the day when I was determined to hear what I had been hearing in my sleep for the past several nights.  I like being able to program the number of times the message repeats & to choose the long & short version of the introduction.  I would recommend Deep Sleep for anyone with restless leg syndrome as well as other problems going to & staying asleep.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Love the story  and will purchase more  Love characters  and the way it's written  Love Nikki Heat-and how she solves cases
B000NY12LO|4.0|plot revolves around school shooting. interesting look at the different perspectives involved.  how the shooter was bullied.  how the cool kids didn't realize the effect of the bullying.  and much more - i would reccommend this book.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I haven't played very long before the game insisted I rate it. between every level so far the game wants you to tell your friends or buy coins.  even for a free game it's a little much.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|It's a great way to pass the time on a summer road trip. Both girls and boys in the ages 9-11 range enjoy this game very much! I'd highly recommend Temple Run Oz!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Downloaded the App which went fine. Clicked on open and it goes right back to the home screen and you click on open again and it keeps doing the same thing. Even tried uninstalling and re-installing. Still doesn't work. Checked my parental controls and it is set at off. What's the deal?
B009AMANBA|5.0|I bought one for every Grandchild. They do not teach this sort of thing in school any more. This is a fantastic movie.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This was a great movie to watch. Liked all the heros that were brought together. Lots of action in this movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is a OMG gal app. I was so excited that it finally came out on kindle fire!! you should defiantly get this app the money paid is worth it!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We have watched all of the movies by this producer & like each one. &#34;Courageous&#34; is the best yet. Drama. Humour. Hysterics & edge of your seat! And I especially appreciate it because it keeps Jesus Christ in our lives.
B008JFUQ16|4.0|The summer of 2013 will likely be remembered as a period of sequels for the computer generated animated feature film segment.  Sure there are some original pieces sliding into the fray (Epic & Turbo for example) but the lion's share of the media attention falls squarely on Pixar's Monsters University, Universal Pictures'/ Illumination's Despicable Me 2 and already the trailers are beginning to circulate for Disney's third entry into the Cars universe: Planes.<br /><br />Depending on who you are, the animated sequel thing can work- look at the Toy Stories and Shreks, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascars, and so on.  That said, it didn't come as too much of a surprise when rumors started circulating a couple of years back that 2010's surprise breakaway hit about a villain turned good guy would be getting a direct sequel as well as a spin-off film featuring the minions a year after that.<br /><br />That brings us to the sequel itself- Despicable Me 2 does away with fancy tag lines and usual sequel fluffery and drops its viewer quickly into a brief reprise of Gru's life as a former supervillain turned domestic daddy caring for three orphan girls.  This time around we learn that his vast resources, technology and manpower (or Minion power as the case may be) are devoted to the business of producing a line of jellies and jams.<br /><br />It doesn't take long for Gru's simple life of parenthood/ Smuckers wannabeism to come to a halt when Lucy Wilde, an agent representing the Anti-Villain League (AVL) abducts the baldheaded mastermind and takes him to a top secret meeting to plead for his assistance in solving a caper involving the disappearance of an Arctic laboratory responsible for the chemical agent PX-41.  PX-41 is dangerous because of its ability to transform mammals injected with it into indestructible purple, wild-haired killing machines.<br /><br />Intel leads the search into a local mall of all places, where a storeowner is suspected of harboring the precious chemical.  Posing as operators of a food court bakery, Gru and Lucy are assigned the task of figuring out who is behind the lab's disappearance before they have an opportunity to unleash the dreaded PX-41 on the world.<br /><br />Sure it isn't much of an extraordinarily rich plot, but it is serviceable enough to set up some genuinely funny moments and visually rich action sequences.  It's all but impossible not to find enjoyment in Steve Carell's zany delivery as Gru; especially with a script that seems to hone in perfectly on all of the nuances that make the character tick.<br /><br />Love em or loathe em, the yellow gibberish-spewing Minions are back with a vengeance and lend some comical moments in a variety of disciplines from light potty humor to all out slap stick to complex visual gags the likes of which wouldn't be uncommon in an old Loony Tunes episode.  There is little doubt Illumination realizes they have struck a chord in the world's collective psyche with these guys and plan to milk the gimmick for all its worth.<br /><br />Fortunately even the Minion overload doesn't take much away from the overall entertainment value of the experience- the fact of the matter is there is something to laugh with, about or at going on in nearly every single scene of the film.  Some of the gags are more in-your-face than others of course (which is sort expected in a piece that targets everyone from young children to the most cynical of adults) but certainly multiple viewings reveal layers of comedic charm one would expect from studios as refined and experienced as say Pixar or DreamWorks.<br /><br />Perhaps the most notable element of the viewing experience comes from a quality that's difficult to pinpoint but unmistakable just the same: the film resonates with the same goofy, almost sublime charm that made the first one so successful.  Unlike something from Pixar that would try to awe you with cleverness or say DreamWorks where each sequence feels like it was refined a million times over in boardroom, Despicable Me 2 never feels like it's working too hard to woo its viewer.  The vivid, unbelievably rich visuals make it nearly impossible to look away while the characters simply do what they do.  In the end you find yourself laughing at Gru's dialog, the Minions' antics, Dr. Nefario's combination of brilliance and geriatrics, a new \\"very macho\\" villain, the unique gadgets (after all, what other movie can boast containing a 21 fart-gun salute?) or some combination of the above.<br /><br />In the event that you haven't been keeping up on such things, Illumination Entertainment has been the modern day incarnation of the King Midas myth.  Beginning with the first Despicable Me and extending through Dr. Suess' The Lorax and now with this sequel that in under a week has managed to bring in more than quadruple it's $76-million dollar budget, it can truly be said everything these guys touch has turned to gold.  Well not really gold so much as yellow- with goggles and blue suspenders.ver in boardroom, Despicable Me 2 never feels like it's working too hard to woo its viewer.

Sure there are some original pieces sliding into the fray (Epic & Turbo for example) but the lion's share of the media attention falls squarely on Pixar's Monsters University, Universal Pictures'/ Illumination's Despicable Me 2 and already the trailers are beginning to circulate for Disney's third entry into the Cars universe: Planes as well as Sony's forthcoming Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2 (I won't even start about a little underwater piece that's been announced called Finding Dory).<br /><br />Okay technically Monsters University is a prequel and not a sequel, the point of course is that we're entering a phase where the big studios aren't quite as concerned with developing new films from the ground up so much as revisiting their established franchises in the hopes of breathing new life into their appeal.<br /><br />I, like many, felt that 2001's Monsters Inc. wasn't in dire need of branching out in either direction of the fictional timeline but figured it would be kind of fun to journey back into the collegiate efforts of Monsters Incorporated's star scarers from the first time the early trailers went public depicting Sulley turning Mike into a makeshift dorm room disco ball (a scene that is, surprisingly, absent from the actual film).<br /><br />What is not absent however is 103-minutes of well-paced Pixar comedy comprising the studio's fourteenth feature film.  The plot, which even the most conservative of commercials or summaries reveals, follows the early exploits of the unlikely duo of James P Sullivan and Mike Wazowski before they were a pair of working class stiffs.<br /><br />The story begins with a brief prologue of the nerdy model elementary student Mike, who, during a field trip to Monsters Inc., decides that one day he'd like to become a famous scarer.<br /><br />His ambition and good grades deliver him to the hallowed halls of Monsters University (MU), touted as the best place to learn the art of scaring.  Fighting an uphill battle from the onset, the small green ball discovers he's got the brains but not the bod to send human children into hysterics.  Before long he meets an egotistical and lazy Sulley; in many ways his inherent opposite and the two begin what could better be described as a rivalry rather than a relationship.<br /><br />Once a mishap gets the pair ejected from the Scare Program, the duo realize the school's \\"Scare Games\\" present an opportunity to redeem their reputations and, thanks to a little slick talking by Mike, a shot at returning to their major of choice.  What results is an impromptu initiation into loser fraternity Oozma Kappa, a battle against insurmountable odds and a whole lot of humorously integrated value of teamwork.<br /><br />Reprising their voice roles more than a decade after the fact, Billy Crystal and John Goodman return with all of the charm and wit that carried the first film.  Even Steve Buscemi is back to play the sneaky Randy while newcomer Helen Mirren casts a dark shadow as the genuinely intimidating Dean Hardscrabble.<br /><br />The key to making the most out of Monsters University is to almost make yourself forget this is a big budget Pixar film.  If such thing were possible, the piece's biggest flaw stems from the fact that Pixar has been spoiling us for nearly 20-years with films that come dangerously close to the definition of perfection.<br /><br />In other words, these guys may actually have raised the bar so high that they themselves can't trump their earlier efforts.  Whether we're talking about the touching friendship established in the Toy Stories, the microcosm of society found within the world of Cars, robotic love discovered amidst endless piles of garbage in a human-less earth in Wall-E, or the simple love for the culinary arts fueling Ratatouille; you could count on Pixar to use the computer-generated medium to take you places  you'd never imagine and to do so with so much clever charm that you thought about the film for days, sometimes even years after watching it.<br /><br />To that end, Monsters University is a far cry from the glory days.  Make no mistake, the film commits no crimes and is enjoyable from start to finish but simply lacks that Pixar magic that has typically put the studio head and shoulders above the competition.<br /><br />Pacing is excellent, the visual charm is flawless and (as mentioned above) the vocal cast is as on point as ever.  However, kids aren't going to understand the nuances of college (or perhaps even more specifically, fraternity or sorority) life and a majority of the situational tension relies upon the ups and downs of life in an institute of higher learning.<br /><br />In conclusion, Monsters University is a prequel that plays it safe and delivers upon all of the spit and polish one would expect from a Disney/ Pixar collaboration but comes off as an unnecessary revisitation to one of their more clever concepts.  At the end of the day, you can go into this one with expectations of Pixar's standards and come away slightly underwhelmed or imagine it as an animated film from just about anyone else and enjoy it for what it is.u places  you'd never imagine and to do so with so much clever charm that you thought about the film for days, sometimes even years after watching it.<br /><br />To that end, Monsters University is a far cry from the glory days.

B004UNX1LS|5.0|I use the vevo  app on all my devices and use the website too. They don't have all artists unfortunately, but they do have a great selection. The loading can be slow sometimes.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded it and it wouldn't let me on to play the game. I deleted it and tried it again and it did the same thing again. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|All of a sudden I can't get the game to load. It keeps returning to the main screen. Help!<br />I do love the game and want it back.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I love many of the visuals depicted in this film. The horn at the cornicopia was my favorite. I do wish the movie would have introduced Madge, the Mayor's daughter though
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a game that is fun for the whole family. I love games with goals and missions. Everyone will love it and they will keep playing it again and again.
0062255657|3.0|I read this on the beach, with the Atlantic in the background. And it was... OK.<br /><br />I've read plenty of reviews comparing this book to Gaiman's other works. Anansi Boys. Neverwhere. American Gods. The Graveyard Book. Coraline. I've read them all, and most of his graphic novels and children's books. I don't know what urges people to make these comparisons, though. Shouldn't any piece of writing, art, whatever, stand on its own? Unfortunately, I don't think this book (novella?) does.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. It's a slim, fun read. But in the end it just seems... limp... and a bit truncated. The problem isn't the premise. There are plenty of things to like about stories told in flashback. In the case of TOATEOTL, it keeps you guessing \\"Is this all real?\\" - \\"A child's fantasy?\\" - \\"An abstraction of personal, semi-forgotten traumas?\\" Perhaps. There are supernatural moments that can be thematically tied to living with an abusive father, or a distant mother. Fear of the body. Fear of death. There's depth here. And the casual blurbs which hint at a larger fantasy universe (\\"Mouse Wars\\") can be read as unfinished thoughts, or the drive-by fantasies that 7-year-olds tend to quickly create, and quickly drop. None of this is bad. Heck, some might consider it insightful. But there's still that pesky limp, and that comes from the main character. The problem is, as I see it, that the protagonist has no agency.<br /><br />He wanders into the plot, pretty much. He reads books. Fights with his sister. Has no friends. Eats. Finds the car. Sees the body. Meets the Hempstocks. And that's pretty much that... The Hempstocks do EVERYTHING. The narrator even states this a few times, but acknowledging that there's a problem doesn't absolve that same problem. It just calls attention to the deficit. And all while this little boy is running around, getting into trouble and solving nothing, being incidental at best, there's Lettie Hempstock. More than a few times while I was reading this all I could think was, \\"Geez! This girl is cool! Why aren't we following her instead?\\"<br /><br />I'm trying not to spoil anything, so I'm mostly keeping to what was mentioned in other reviews and what was written in the book jacket. But the ending must be mentioned. Not details of how it goes down, just my impression. And that is, it feels like the protagonist wanders in, then wanders out. Maybe he's changed... it's unclear. What is clear, though, is Lettie's contribution. Because of what she does and how she effects the world, and the other characters, and even the protagonist, I think a good case can be made for Lettie being the Real Protagonist. Only, she isn't the one being followed. Instead, we follow the ineffectual neighbor child who just so happens to run into all this. And that makes the whole thing feel like you just bought a new video game, and although it's very nice and looks interesting, for some reason you're an NPC watching the main character. And although it's pleasant to walk around and wonder what's going on, you just feel kinda useless.<br /><br />That, I think, is the reason this book is just... OK. It's pretty, and nice, and the narration is organic and moving, but there's no visceral punch because you don't feel involved with the protagonist. Because the boy is all reactions. Passive. Again, limp. Until the climax, that is... but even that's a little \\"ehhh\\"... This is strange for Gaiman. In my experience, in the past, he's written loads of very good, exciting characters that may wander a bit, but still make an impact through their willpower and resourcefulness. Here though, taken on its own, the kid protagonist can't manage to dent his own story, and that alone kills any tension or anticipation. Anyway, it did for me.<br /><br />If you buy this, upon closing the book, don't be surprised if it all fades away like some strange but insubstantial daydream.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the complete series because they kept making me ask for more. Even after the last book I wanted more!!! I would have loved a longer description of the others ending life. Still amazing book
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|The game is awesome but I have lots of dinosaurs and don't want to delete it but won't download the new version what should I do?
B009A87ZKG|5.0|Patton was the greatest general since Stonewall Jackson. A must see for anyone who appreciates history and understands the importance of great men.
B0012GTZC0|5.0|This was the first thriller of Follett's that I've read and I really like his style.  If you like him try his Century Trilogy, too.

B007FC3AAI|5.0|i love the movie the dress she wore was beautiful and just everything bout the movie was awesome. the pregnacy, how the wolfs tryed to attack her. it was freaken great. i hope they make more to the ending
B00CW665VI|5.0|... Then buy this now. It's like a witty screenplay, heavy on rapid-fire dialogue and snappy internal thoughts that will make you howl with laughter. He's like an acerbic stand-up comedian who's competitive and out to get women - until he meets his sweet, unpretentious, ambitious Kate. You will be flipping the pages so fast, and done with this novel in a blink. And then you'll re-read sections because you want to laugh again.. This is one of the most refreshing, engaging romances I've read in years.  Why? Because it sounds like a real, live male we're dealing with here.  Not a romance where the hero immediately worships the smug, princess-y heroine.  This guy is a sharp-tongued, selfish player who responds visually to women, the way real guys do, he's crass, crude, rude and EXCITING. This is how guys really talk.  My husband is a wiseacre and sounds like this dude.  The humor - total guy humor.  Trust me, the cynical punchy one-liners will have you laughing out loud.  This is a hybrid of \\"Wedding Crashers\\" humor with a cocky Wall Street wolf - who later becomes as romantically desperate as John Cusack holding a boombox over his head.  (LOL!)  So satisfying to read about a \\"real guy\\" for once, someone who isn't sugar-coated. The instant I got wind of this novel, I downloaded the eBook, and then hit \\"buy\\" for the paperback.  This is a daring new take, written strictly in the male POV and it's a smash. Most clever dialogue I've read in years. Thank you, publisher, for taking a risk with this. What a way to break the mold. This author will spawn hundreds of imitators, wait and see.  I can't wait for her next book.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My three year old daughter and six year old son both enjoyed this movie. Even though it was about a princess it wasn't &#34;too princess&#34; for him.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is an achievement first of all in writing terms. The story told is breathtaking and yet a balance has to be found and it is. I read the whole thing in 3 days.
B008KRJWEK|3.0|I like the game so far it's kind of a temple run with car an zombies instead of coins I'll give a more through review if it keeps me playing I get bored quick with most tablet games
B0066W1AZK|3.0|I use this to kill some time. It pretty decent nothing too spectacular, but fun. If your looking for chess this isnt bad
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Best way to kill time while husband checks sports scores or waiting for appointments or meetings!! Just wish people would play faster sometimes.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An imaginative and creative book. It's an easy read, but enjoyable. It got me hooked and interested in the next books in the series

B0063IH60K|3.0|I use this to kill some time. It pretty decent nothing too spectacular. It's solitaire so it can only be so exciting
0451205766|4.0|Im 13 years old and I like about anything to do with organized crime, and I love the movie but should I read it. If its too complicated , ill just wait, but if someone could tell me id appreciate it thanks.

B000OJFV4C|4.0|What a scheming group of folks in The Tudors!  Although this series has historical and timeline inaccuracies, it's pretty engrossing once you become familiar with all the characters and their flaws.  Well acted.  The costumes and scenery are well done.  I will continue watching and am about to launch into Season 2.
B004NELBPC|3.0|This is a decent app i use to check in on whats going on. Overall its just okay, nothing to special
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season was full surprises ... Cant wait for season 4 but too bad i have to wait later than the UK fans but either way its worth the wait. One of the best shows I've ever watched!
B005K17RU0|3.0|This is a decent weather app, it updates quickly and has the locations that I want to look at. overall its not bad
0440217563|4.0|always great shipping...but this series I really like, but it's just too long. even I loved HP books..which are great to re-read. but this series just isn't getting to the point.  yup, said something earlier about loving it, but thought it would finally get to the point, but hasn't. so really, go to library to see if you really want to buy copy and keeping up with it. I'll check it out...next time if I want to continue. she does a good job at imagining you are there...but hasn't furthered the story line. arggh. too bad.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This is another great book from George R Martin. I simply cannot wait for winds of winter!! The show will have to hold me over for now
0760335540|5.0|Purchased my &#34;pre-owned&#34; Porsche Boxster only 3 weeks ago and have changed my low-beam headlights to HID's and all interior lights to LED's.

B003O86FMW|4.0|An imaginative and creative book. It's an easy read, but enjoyable. It got me hooked and interested in the next book in the series
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the game. The only problem is when I play it on my KF it keeps going back to the main screen. Otherwise it is a great game. Get it but be careful.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|its angry birds and its free, so I can't complain. It is a great way to kill some time or just to relax
B0014JGDUC|3.0|I wish I was able to find these in an actual store rather than always having to order them.  I've had several pairs and the sizing simply isn't consistent.  I continue to order them because they're the best I've found for standing on a hard floor all day.  The non-slip sole is a bonus.
B001DDBCUA|3.0|I bought this as a gift for my girlfriend. It came on time and intact. She seemed to like it
B00957T6X6|5.0|I loved these books, I can't wait until the next come out to see where he takes it. It could go on forever!
0375869026|5.0|I haven't read it, but my 13-year-old, who is an avid reader, thought it was terrific. The premise sounds unique and I am eager to read it, too.
159463176X|3.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is one of my most beloved reads....  Kite Runner too...  So, my expectations were high, and I assumed that this one would make the list as well.  I won't say that I did not like the book, but I found it scattered and a bit jumpy.  Some of the character development was outstanding, while others were very much lacking.  It was not the page turner and Che cultural eye opener that I was hoping for.
B000FC1RCI|4.0|This is Christie with some existential substance. Ten people on an island, each with a morally ambiguous past, watch in mounting terror as they dwindle one by one. And then there were none. While it borders on silly at times -- and that's to be expected of the genre -- it grips and doesn't let go until the very end.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved it!!! Can't wait for future sequels. It made me save captain america & thor for this weekend.  Adrenaline rush in all the right places. Rd jr. is iron man. I fell in love with cris evans as captain america. Bummed about surprise main character death! Bummer. I will watch again when I need motivation & adrenaline boost. Avengers Rock! Watch this, can't go wrong!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minions rush is a awesome game it's fun and addicting I like the move because of the minions so I like the game.
B002QZ399G|5.0|Love this bitter sweet, twisted tortured, well editors story told!  Characters are phenomenal. Oscar nominations & wins! It's one you have to watch closely & more than once, like traffic & crash. Piecing it together is a great pickle for the mind. Leaves you shaking your head...
B00004U45G|5.0|I saw this show in Camden, NJ. A friend of mine said he had some great tickets and man was he right. Kenny Wayne Sheppard, a much younger and rougher, was the opening act. Kenny wailed on some old standards as well as some of his early hits. Then on to the show. Remembering this is when The Crowes were blowin' up....I mean white hot! To see them pair with Jimmy Paige was a dream come true. I was too young to see anything but The Song Remains the Same from Led Zeppelin days. Man it would have been cool to take in a show, I would have stood in line for days. But this was the next best thing at the time.<br /><br />So this is from the Greek, not to sure of the dates of Camden but I'm sure the set list was a bit different. This does bring back my memories of the Camden show though. Great production with great artists, always appreciated! A must for any Zeppelin/Crowes fan.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Brilliant as ever. Game of Thrones rocks!<br />Includes castillian spanish audio, great choice for spanish customers (like me! ;) )
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I would love to have played this game.  Downloaded it twice to my Kindle Fire and the game opens with no pictures on the right to find the objects.  I clicked on several of the items in the room and they come up, but the puzzle does not function or move.  Can't do anything with it.  So I uninstalled.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and interesting puzzle but it should have more levels. So much fun and addicting and it really makes you think.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I use Battery on my Android device. One of the very first apps I looked for after getting my Kindle Fire HD was this app. It has been on my Kindle since day one and I've never had a problem with it.  It works as advertised- displays battery charge, time left for various uses, battery temp (mine cools with non-use, heats with use...as is norm. Has NEVER heated inexplicably as someone else mentioned), displays charge rate, discharge rate, graphs usage, etc.<br />This is a great app. Couldn't imagine my Kindle without it.<br />Good job devs!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game is super fun and great for kids who like make over and dress up games. Recommended for everyone who likes to style.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie blew me away.  I immediately ordered the DVD so I can add it to my collection and watch it many more times.  I love movies with complex plots that make you think.  I also feel that acting, action, and special effects should not be the focus of the movie, but should only be there to serve the plot.  This movie fit the bill in every way.  Two cautions: Rent it when you're going to have time to watch it twice (it's well worth your time), because it's hard to take it all in with just one viewing.  And turn on the captions/subtitles; some segments are done in dialects that can be difficult to understand.
159463176X|3.0|Just finished Khaled Hoseeini's new book And the Mountains Echoed and gave it a C or 3 star rating.  I was disappointed with this book and while the author had a good idea the execution didn't bode all that well for me as a reader.  Hosseini used a multitude of characters which were all inter related to tell about Afghanistan and a group of people with ties to this war torn nation.  Each chapter began with an unknown person and it took me a bit to adjut to the new narrator and then storyline.  Once it got going it was alright but by the fifth chapter I was tired of moving on and in the adark for a bit.  The story goes full circle withan inevitable ending but by then I was glad tosee the book end.<br /><br />Because I so enjoyed Hosseini's first two books, The Kite Runner and then A Thousand Splendid Suns I eagerly waited for this newest publication.  And while some of the writing was both poignant and beautiful  I was ultimately disappointed in what I feel was disjointed and confusing.  Perhaps it was bit too much to think a third book would be as good as the first two.  And to paraphrase the title of a Doris Goodwin's book, Maybe Next Year about the Brooklyn Dodgers winning the World Series, maybe Hosseini's next book  will be another great title.  I eagerly wait for it along with many others who were sorry to read this book and remember back to his other titles.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Its the best game!!! Good for little kids to play!!! You should try it.. It keeps your kid busy!!! Its awesome!!! ;)
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A story that starts in many places at once, telling the tale of many lives that are intertwined. There is love, happiness, and a hearty dose of tragedy, but overall there is hope. A must read.
B00CATSONE|1.0|I understand that this book was free, but why do I still feel cheated? It's because the author is a time thief. He stole my time... and the best I can do now is maybe save you, a potential reader, some time. Google Tesla and take your pick. The guy is a most interesting subject. Don't waste your time here.
B008AUGEFC|5.0|The scope of Cloud Atlas is amazing. It's an engaging, clever, thought-provoking piece of literature. The characters are interesting and well-drawn. Their stories have weight and significance. It's an achievement in both writing and reading, and I'm happy I read it from cover to cover.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have always loved this app until it updated 2 days ago.  now its confusing and wont stay off.  I always go in a shut it down manually as it eats up battery running in the background.  now every time the kindle shuts off or times out it automatically starts the app again.  I'm uninstalling it.
B00AFOS8A0|5.0|The sound of the CD's are great. Decca took great care in getting the best sound possible. I grew-up with this music. I appreciate all of Verdi's lesser known works in this grand collection.
0446571415|5.0|I haven't read this one yet, but I've enjoyed every book so far and I'm looking forward to experiencing this new episode!
B004PVF95Q|5.0|There is really not much to say other than this is an exceptional work from Elbow. Timeless would be a good way to describe it.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|I'm a huge fan of The Expendables... Completely lost interest in Expendables 2 within 20 minutes. Dumbed down version for the hyperactive crowd that needs action over plot.
B0017P7MOO|5.0|There is really not much to say other than this is another exceptional work from Elbow. Timeless would be a good way to describe it.
B004P12SSW|4.0|Channing Tatum is an amazing dancer! The story lines on both the movies are good and the music and dancing is incredible
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Jane Austen has me now wishing for my Mr. Darcy.  I going to now read the rest of her book and fall in love with other characters in her books.  But I think that Elizabeth Bennett will always have a special place in my Heart.
B0093OGBL6|5.0|This is the best book about Michael Jackson that I have red.  After Mike passed everyone want to write something about him. Suddenly, everyone found out a writer inside yourself. It could be not so bad if the people would have a concern and a commitment with the true. But we can see that  people is interested only in catch the good moment and the get much money. Then, they repeat most of the garbage that tabloids publish ever.<br />But this author is different. She is a fan but is not blind. She loves Michael so she wanted to know the true, she looked to inside the true and she wrote the true, without masks, without lie.<br />I'd like to tell you to undress the concepts and prejudices and give to yourself a chance to heard a voice that is not media, or someone interested in money. Give to yourself a chance to know this man through others eyes.  Through loves's eyes.
B009A87X80|5.0|great cd, beautiful songs followed by abeautiful voice. I have no regrets in buying this cd you cannot go wrong.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|My family enjoyed watching the movie. It is wholesome fun and entertaining, especially watching it on Blu-Ray. I salute to the producer and director.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|The Metal Gear saga has had quite the legacy over the past two decades.  The games have gone on to further a genre and they helped change the way video games tell stories.  Konami seems to hoping to get as many people as they can to experience these games.  If you've never jumped into Metal Gear before, this collection comes at a very affordable price for the number of games you get with it.<br /><br />There isn't much need to discuss the story of Metal Gear here. In the first place, we'd be here all day just trying to discuss what it all means. And in the second place, the majority of you getting your hands on this have probably already experienced these games once before. I will only say that the story of the saga is absorbing, confusing and a lot of fun. Gamers have been absorbed by the themes of these games for quite some time, but experiencing them again isn't always so bad. The cutscenes are usually good. Some of them are a little long, but they're very well done. Complete with great voice acting, humor, drama and action. The cinematic experience of Metal Gear Solid is a jack of all trades.  This review assumes that you are at least somewhat familiar with the Metal Gear franchise.<br /><br />This particular collection comes with pretty much the entire saga all in one place.  You'll get the original Metal Gear Solid.  Metal Gear Solid 2: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid 3: HD Edition, Metal Gear Solid Peace Walker HD Edition, two digital graphic novels, Metal Gear Solid 4: Trophy Edition, an artbook and download vouchers to get Metal Gear Solid and Metal Gear Solid VR Missions.  While I'd have much rather been given an actual disk for the original game and VR Missions, I'll make due with a code.  Because you are getting the HD Editions of Metal Gear Solid 2 and Metal Gear Solid 3, it should be known that you will be getting the Substance and Subsistence versions respectively.  Meaning, dear fans, that yes, you can experience Metal Gear 1 and Metal Gear 2.  In short, you truly are getting the core of the saga.<br /><br />As such, it's also fun to see just how the games have really changed over time.  If you begin with the very first game and play all the way through to the fourth you'll notice that all of the games play strikingly different from one another.  The first Metal Gear Solid is a gem no matter what, but it's nice to take into account just how much the second game adds to it.  Likewise, the third game also has its own gameplay variety, some of which carries to the fourth game.  It's incredible to see just how Metal Gear has evolved over the past two decades and how their stories are told.  Obviously if you're getting this, you'll need to prepare yourself for some moments where you'll be watching a lot.  Metal Gear has a pretty dense story, even as far back as the first game.  This is especially true because future games have no shame in referencing older ones.<br /><br />There's a lot in this collection and for the price that's a pretty big value.  There's always the question of whether or not it's worth getting a new collection when the games within it have had previous releases.  It's hard to answer this question.  If you've yet to pick up the Metal Gear Solid Saga before then this is definitely the buy you should get.  You'll get the entire core story if you decide to go with this collection and you really can't beat that price in this regard.  On the other hand if you've already got the HD Collection and you've already downloaded the Metal Gear Solid on the PSN there isn't much else beyond the digital graphic novels and artbook that you're really going to get.  Certainly you get MGS4, but that's a pretty common find in almost any used game shop for a pretty cheap price.  It's not so much that these games have all gotten pretty recent releases, it's more so that their last release (the HD Collection) wasn't all that long ago and is still readily available in stores.  Personally, I find that for all you're gettingit's a solid collection.  Not only is all the stuff in the HD collection here, but you get an artbook and two graphic novels as well as a voucher for the original Metal Gear Solid as well as VR missions.<br /><br />That voucher does bring about a minor issue for some, however.  The first and simplest is that if you bought the game used that voucher might not do you any good.  The other (and probably bigger) issue at hand is that if you bought Metal Gear Solid already the voucher won't do you any good.  For the sake of collector's value a physical disc of Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions might've actually been better.<br /><br />Nevertheless, on its own, the collection is probably one of the best collections you could get for Metal Gear Solid.  It's a pretty decent price for all that you're getting with it.  You might have to think for a moment if you've already got the HD Collection in your hands, but for the inclusion of the graphic novels, the downloads for the original Metal Gear Solid and VR Missions as well as the artbook, it might just be worth trading in your HD Collection and simply replacing it with this one.it's a solid collection.

B008EZVNO0|3.0|Again this is one of my husband's favorites, and he thinks its not his best work. So he may grow to like it better maybe
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|I recently watched the movie part of me and thought I would try out this CD.  It is fun to listen too.  I think I might be a newish fan.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Personal point of view from a man & family going through an unimaginable nightmare.  This book was different from what I usually read & I couldn't put it down.
B006M4RN3U|4.0|This was a good disc.  Only didn't care for the vocals on track 5 and 10.  But the rest of CD was very good.
1849904251|5.0|very quick delivery<br />if you love BBC SH drama series, this book is really worth reading<br />the &#34;tips&#34; style conversations bring me so much funny. XDDD<br />love casebook ~
B001EBWIPE|5.0|Philadelphia story is an extremely well done love story. It's fun, witty, cunning, and you can watch it 10 times over and pick up missed witticisms and wise cracks. I want to be Cary Grant in this film but Jimmy Stewart was also a force to be reckoned with. The scene when Macauley Conner (Stewart) shows up at CK Dexter Havens (Grant) home in the middle of the night drunk to talk is one of my favorite scenes of all time. Katherine Hepburn was beautiful and smart and funny. Any man would fall in love with her!<br /><br />Best Movie for date night!
B00ABO609A|5.0|This film is very moving, emotionally powerful and sensually pleasing. The trajectory of the protagonists' relationship was thought- provoking and powerful. I would like to own this- I still am thinking about it, days later.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Its much quicker to refer to an online Bible and it has so many cool devotions that you can choose depending on what you are dealing with in your life or at a certain point in your spiritual walk. There is also a verse of the day that often is just what I need. I love this app and am so glad my son showed it to me
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I tried this game first and immediately bought it. It is tremendous fun. A challenging game that reels you in and won't let go. Fun graphics and side games. A great game I find myself enjoying it more every time I play it!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I give this 5 stars because I think it is cool and it is very adicting and I I think other kids and grownups out there that haven't discovered minecraft should because it is cool and adicting. I LUV MINECRAFT IT IS THE BEST GAME IN THE UNIVERSE
B00AVFO41K|4.0|At first I didn't like this game. I thought it popped up too many new ones with each move. I was determined to figure out a strategy and once I did I began enjoying the game. My top score is above 1500...so far. I keep two things in mind...diagonal and clear more than five.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I feel Archer was really stringing everything along this time which made for some tedious reading but I do like the characters and found it pretty good.  Some of the things the Clifton's get into are not really very smart and you'd think this amazing family would do things with a little more thought - especially the ending.  The ending in the first book was a bit lame too, not something a bright young man would actually do.
B003GK21OE|4.0|Great. Trying to find which book is the sequel. Great reading material. First one I read. But not the last!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so fun better than temple run but it did take a long time to load it was all worth it don't think twice about getting this game you wont reagret it
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|getting old, a bit boring at moments, acting still strong but writing a bit of a drag in the long run.
B005DJREGQ|2.0|I was surprised at the rating on this and then right from the beginning being very disappointed in how much sexual content was show and talked about, so glad I didn't watch it with my kids!! I turned it off quickly.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My son and daughter both love this movie. When I saw it on sale we had to get it. The kids love the vibrant colors, singing and dancing in the movie
B00005QGAV|5.0|Although this isn't my favorite MJ cd it is still MJ so it can't be beat. I absolutely love cruising down memory lane listening to these songs
B004SBS8LA|5.0|this game is soooooo addicting, it's not even funny! Love it even more since it is ad-free. No complaints here.
B00005QGAT|5.0|This is hands down MJs best cd. Yes the rest were good too, but this right here is IT! Can't get any better
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is the best game ever. it is totally for people who love dispicadle me and challengeng game.people like that should get this app.
B00140PK6O|5.0|This is one of the best series out there. If you like historical fiction. You will love this. It has a wonderful dramatic side but also a delightful comedic side.
B00A6L78YE|3.0|The experience with the vendor was superb, no complaints.  The CD arrived in great condition and timely.  The band's album wasn't as strong as I had hoped it to be.  A friend recommended them and I went to Youtube to listen to their songs.  Not much variety was available so from what I heard it sounded worth the try based on the song San Francisco which is a pleasant pop song.  I may need more time listening to the CD but I wasn't knocked over and therefore don't believe I will be buying another of their CDs but am not unhappy about the purchase.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I only started watching this a short time ago, and am now completely hooked.  How did I miss this when it was running on regular TV?  Love it!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Love the timed version, it is fun trying to beat my best time and then my daughter plays and tries to beat my time too. Easy to navigate the screen on my Kindle.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I purchased the full version of this game and absolutely love it!  It's a fun and relaxing game and am glad to have purchased it.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|This game has too many animations and too many extra things to do, I was looking for a basic bingo game.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|I wasn't too sure about Matt Smith as the Doctor - David Tennant is a VERY tough Doctor to follow. With that said, Matt Smith has made the role his own and is a close second to David. Matt Smith has become better and better as time goes on and I'm truly sad to see him go after only three seasons. The Matt Smith companions have been memorable as well - Amy Pond and River Song both left lasting & positive impressions. I'm nervously waiting to find out who will replace Matt Smith after the 2013 Christmas special.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Guesses the weather with the best of them, easy to use format.  Well laid out, I have no complaints whatsoever.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|one of the best games I ever downloaded.  like temple run but with minions.  always something new to do, never gets old.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|So much fun, but you can almost guarantee the AI will get doubles like crazy at the end if they're getting their butt kicked.  The doubles even out over the long run, but it sure feels like it is cheating on occasion, just like the real game!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing! Captures me right from the beginning . Could not put the book down and read ithe whole book in less than 48 hours..
B009K0P10K|5.0|Such an awesome show! I can't wait to see the next Season! It's a great story line with a plot that always surprises you.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|Can't get the videos to play. Ended up deleting the app. Don't waste your time.  Not sure if its the app or the kindle... Should of got an iPad!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A book for any good read ,but especially for those who have had any mental or addiction problems can relate to. A must read. I found it very real and a wonderful and uplifting story. 5 Stars and the movie is great as well
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I so wished my son were with me when I was watching this. The movie is filled with so many feelings mothers and sons who have a good relationship often encounter - you love each other, but can drive each other crazy.I felt as though I was in that car. Lots of laughs and good feelings in the end. - and yes - I hope they do go to Europe. I'd watch that movie, too.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|Yes I have watched this when it was still on VHS. Restoration is very good and makes the watching very colorful and dramatic.
B003B02O0A|3.0|The book was ok. Normally books are much better than the movie, but not in this case. I'm curious about the sexual though.
B006GHA9VQ|4.0|Like the Panthom better but the story and plot is very good as a continuation from the first/last scene from the Panthom
B004LP3AYI|5.0|this was a great book and we loved it lots, and can't wait for the final five books to be available as kindle books .. . . . . . . . . .
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Hello there everyone! Historical Landings is a fun, well developed flight simulator. It has a friendly interface and follows a simple story line. Currently it only has a selection of three planes but hopefully in the future it will add more. It also has three different landing terrains: Airstrip, field, and aircraft carrier. Overall I give this game 5 stars. I have already played the story line twice and am going back for more.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I was surprised at how much I liked this version of Sherlock Holmes.  It has a little something for everyone, romance, adventure, speed, fancy effects, solid storyline, superb acting, and excellent costuming, cinematography, and directing.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is perfect to keep the small size of the kindle. It actually fit in my purse nicely. Also, very durable. My son dropped it twice and no damage was done, thankfully.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Finally, Amazon has brought a popular Facebook game to their Kindle tablets!!!  I had been waiting for Candy Crush Saga, but this one is just as good.  It's similar to the &#34;bubble shooter&#34; games, but it is more challenging.  You really have to work for your &#34;stars&#34;, but it's fun!  :)
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|I downloaded this since it was free.  Don't waste your time. I deleted it off my Kindle after playing for maybe 2 minutes.  Graphics are slow, pixelated,and just plain ugly. If you're looking for a good haircut game, pay the 2.99 and get the one from Toca Boca.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|In my opinion this is the best keyboard for a phone, if you're looking for a great keyboard give this one a try
B00CWY76CC|3.0|this is a great puzzle you really need to think can't wait to see more when available sometimes I have to walk away and come back when I have thought about the puzzle
B0012SCHZK|4.0|a great company of actors brings the drama of this animation to life. The CGI is now a bit dated (human features have always been difficult) but the animation is still visceral and exciting. However, this is still something that is only for a pretty narrow group. happily, I'm in that group.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|This is another one of those Statham action movies. It moves fast and keeps your attention. The unrated edition is definitely more bloody definitely not one for the kiddies. If you are in the mood for a very good action flick this one is definitely it.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Very difficult on normal. Coming up with the perfect mixture of deadliness, transferability, and cure prevention is finicky. I got to the point where I killed off all but 800,000 or so, yet they still found the cure in time. Still working hard to avoid buying unlocks. Starting to think it's impossible. Coincidence? I think not.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It starts deceptively easy and till you know it you've been staring at a board for over 5 minutes and you're no closer to solving it!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I rented this with my girlfriend and we usually don't watch kids movies, but this is a well done movie and possible one of the cutest movies ever.
B000063UR2|5.0|I made several purchases of this video &#34;Legend&#34; from Amazon's selection of stores in search of getting the U.S. Theatrical version with the original Tangerine Dream sound track to the movie. I did not care for the Jerry Goldsmith score (Director's cut) for the reasons that it wasn't exciting or dramatic enough for this movie which depicted eerie and morbid scenes in half of the film. Hollywood can just stop tampering with the originals of movies and stop with the making of this kind of cut version and that type of special version of films in hopes to bring in more money and let me just have what I originally saw. So in the long scheme of things I ended up with 3 Legends just from attempting to get the right one with the Tangerine Dream Score, and part of that is because I saw no need to spend more of my time, energy and travels to be packaging and mailing back the first 2 copies considering that they were so inexpensive from Amazon...<br />Comment by Chris Johnson of<br />enlighteningthemind.com
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really addictive game but I would make lots of changes like the prices are to high they might get your reviews down but on the other hand as I said its really addictive.
B0030V0PEW|5.0|Dr. Gawande has taken a simple concept and masterfully transformed it into an effective tool to cope with the complexities of the modern world. A must read for anyone with goals to achieve effectiveness in professional life and/or personal life.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Looking forward to season 4. cannot believe the finale.  looking forward to shirley mmclaine's return.  and i've read about the new cast members. exciting.
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|I prefer this type of game for my grandsons over the zombie games, however they still think its great to be able to browse through all of the choices provided by Amazon.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great read! It was hard to put the book down! Just when you think you  know what is happening there is a new surprise twist!
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|This is such a fun book. You have to find stars and all the creatures and people are clickable. I would buy this again.
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|It kept you on the edge. Guessing what is to come next. It was refreshing to know their were some surprises.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Love it and use it almost daily! I recommend this app highly!!! Works great and very accurate. Just wish it came in Pink!!
B0015DROBO|4.0|Thrilling and easy read. The book engages you and I will certainly want to read all the other books available.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is def another one my niece put on my device. Not something a grown up would play for sure.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This is by far the best \\"Live\\" DVD that I have seen this year.  It is wonderful. It is so real that you actually think.....you are at the concert. Sade and her musicians are in rare<br />form.  Everything is great - sound, settings, background, lighting.<br /><br />If you have not seen this DVD, give yourself and family members a real musical experience.  You will never regret it!!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|An easy game to play but very addicting and fun for all ages!  I found this in a  search for top rated free games- so happy I came across this and the first one.  I have so many games on my kindle fire, but this is the only that reminds me of super Mario bros.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|There are no words to describe this game. Way better than temple run and brave I will play this all day long both on my kindle and my phone. I love this game!!!!
B004I2K4E8|2.0|Very disappointed, tried with two different disk but could not get the disk to run on my blue ray DVD .
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|This was purchased for my grandson and he said that it is very cool. He loves watching it every day.
B004EPYZUS|1.0|not region compatible. surely this should have been taken into consideration when shipping internationally!! not happy at all. how does one redeem this problem?
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day once again pulls you in and takes your breath away with her superb descriptive writing of Eva and Gideon's highly intoxicating romance.

B003HO0RG8|1.0|ANOTHER HELL-BAD RECORD FROM A SECOND HELL-BAD BAND THIS MONTH. IS JULY 2013 JUST THROTTLING WITH ME THAT MUCH WITH HORRIBLE BANDS?<br /><br />All this band is capable of is extremely horrifying vocals and screaming that SUCKS VERY BADLY. Not only that, but in the first MOUTH GUTTER BROTH CLUSTERGARBAGE FLOTH track \\"Worms of the senses\\", they actually enable a very terrible high-pitch shriekish noise (NOT FROM THE BAND, and Brody Dalle even isn't able to make a SCREAM that high in a song). Is Lostprophets moving to a very high standard here? Because it looks like Lostprophets may become a descent band. I CAN'T BELIEVE I CHECKED OUT THIS STUPID BAND. When I first checked them out, I though they were going to be only slightly bad, like KillRadio. BUT THEY ARE A POST-HARDCORE BAND. Every single song is just pointless screaming vocals with extremely awful guitars and extremely negative energy. I'M SO SICK AND TIRED OF FINDING BANDS THAT ARE ABLE TO SUCK THAT BAD. This album is so bad that this TIES with Coral Fang as the worst record, even though I know about other albums that suck JUST as much. This album is offensive not only to rock, but also to any music genre. You know the deal: If this doesn't shock you, who are you?ALSO DESERVE TO BE BOYCOTTED AND DISRESPECTED BY EVERYONE THEY KNOW FOR RECORDING THIS EXTREME PILE OF MONUMENTAL FECAL MATTER. You know the deal: If this doesn't shock you, who are you?
B005NPCJ88|4.0|Didnt buy this album for years cause buddy said it sux, well he was wrong.  Damn good album, with great riffs and breakdowns u expect
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This book got me interested in politics in a way no teacher, professor, class, lecture, etc. ever has. This is a must read!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This is such a cute game! I LOOOVE the movie and think this game is soooo much better than Temple Run or Subway Surfers. There's just one problem... I can't play it because it crashes before it gets to the menu! Please fix! Otherwise, I would rate it 5 stars.
0761536434|5.0|Book is full of many, many interesting little facts, like how Namco tangled with the Yakuza, or the interesting meeting of Sears and Atari. All in all, if you're a video game nut, this is a must read.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game but I think when u retry it takes too long to get to the actual game but besides that awesome :)
B008CIUS72|1.0|this produckt was not worth the time it took to download it, I would not put it on any one of my devices agean
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This used to be a great product, but now eats my battery and is hard to find the info I'm looking for. Wish I knew how to roll it back to the last version. I will be using a different weather app, but which one, I'm not sure yet.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun and addicting game...Challenging without being impossible... I can't wait for more levels!  How long do I have to wait!!?
0887307280|5.0|This book offers a fresh viewpoint on what is important to start and run a successful business.  This book provides some very specific approaches to building and running a business.  The ideas are worth reading and understanding.  Some are more difficult to implement than others.  Worth reading.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing! Its so addicting and fun. I love the despicable me movies, so I love this game.
B00CW665VI|4.0|If you read my reviews very often, you'll know that I LOVE reading from the male POV.  So when I saw this book was from Drew's POV, I was all over it.  What did I think of being in Drew's head?  Hehe - I was either laughing my head off or wanting to slap him - hard.<br /><br />Drew Evans is a hard time player.  The boy doesn't do repeats, ask him - he'll tell ya.  He doesn't do relationships and he doesn't have to work harder than smiling to get exactly what he wants.  Until he meets Katherine Brooks or Kate.  She's engaged and turns him down flat when he meets her in a bar and he should be glad since she shows up working at his father's investment bank the next day.  Doesn't matter to him.  He wants her.  He's sure if he could just get her out of his system, then things would go back to normal.  But a few kisses has him not looking at other women - say what?  I thoroughly enjoyed this playboy learning about falling in love.<br /><br />I liked Kate, mostly.  She stands up to this player and kicks him in the shins too.  YES she does! Under the board room table no less.  I'm cheering her on - you go girl!  They both have a competitive  nature and it's fun to watch them spare.  The only time I wanted to kick her back was when it came time for her to do some forgiving.  Without spoiling anything, I'm just gonna say that both sides needed to be doing some apologizing and only one was.  Then her girlfriend goes after him.  I'm thinking no way, girl! Not cool.  This book could have lost 30 or 40 pages near the end and I'd have been a whole lot happier with this story.  Seriously, how much till you believe the boy is being straight with you?<br /><br />I did read it in a day.  Laughed so hard a few times, I thought I would cry.  It's a sexy adult read that can satisfy that romance itch in a heartbeat.  If you like them funny and very hot, then this one is a good one to read.

B00DC7NNAC|1.0|I thought this was one of the worst movies I've seen in a very long time. I hated that it affiliated itself in any way with a classic such as the &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34;. Horrible acting, and horrible movie.

0425252868|5.0|A Higher Call was recommended to me as a wonderful could-not-put-it-down read.  I got this book at the library and finished it in two days.  I could not put it down.  This is a true story of combat during World War II, written by Adam Makos with Larry Alexander.  Adam Makos was intrigued by the stories of the \\"Greatest Generation\\", those who fought in World War II.  His intent was to talk to and read about as many veterans of that war as possible before it was too late.  He also intended to only include stories of the Allied veterans.  He contended that Nazi Germany was the enemy and did not want to include their stories.<br /><br />However, there is an instance of \\"the most incredible encounter between enemies in World War II\\" that he just couldn't overlook.  It involves 20 year-old Captain Charlie Brown from West Virginia, who captained a B-17 bomber with a crew of 10 men and Second Lieutenant Franz Stigler, a German pilot from Bavaria who flew a Bf109F fighter.  On December 20, 1943, these two pilots met in a most interesting and miraculous encounter over the skies of Germany.  What occurred after this makes a fantastic tale of war.<br /><br />These two men would both survive the war and were destined to meet again.  I guarantee that reading this novel will give you new insight to the Allied pilots' bravery and most of all, a greater look into the lives of the pilots of the Luftwaffe.  There were acts of bravery and chivalry committed every day by pilots from both sides of the war.  I was also interested to read about how the German people lived their lives during the war, under the dictatorship of a madman and his equally crazy henchmen.  You will find this an amazing story that you cannot get out of your mind.  This story and the stories of those who stayed at home becoming \\"Rosie the Riveters'\\" and shipyard and airplane factory workers is a most extraordinary tale of the war.  I'm not sure that we, as a nation, could pull together as those in the \\"Greatest Generation\\" did during that horrible time in history.<br /><br />I applaud the authors, Mr. Makos and Mr. Alexander, for bringing us these stories from the very mouths of those who lived them before time caught up far enough to make them stories only to be read from previously written reports and memoirs.<br /><br />You can find this review on my blog at [...], on Good Reads at [...]ing that horrible time in history.

B000WFBC6E|2.0|My Mondaine clock died after about eight years. Prior to that it ran well enough, though compared to my Mondaine watch, its accuracy was OK rather than great. Perhaps an 8-year life is considered normal in a throw-away society, but if so, the price should be cut at least in half.
B00633W614|5.0|I read the first book in this series and loved it.  I also really loved the second  book and am looking forward to the last one as well.  The books are definately page turners!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|Very similar to Forrest Gump, but with some definite twists.  Great use of comedic elements and all of the characters are likable.  Brilliant walk through historical figures and important world times.

0385737947|5.0|I really liked this book and read it in one day. I loved the action and suspense of finding out the puzzle of the maze. There were just enough hints to keep you guessing and asking \\"What would I do?\\". I liked this book so much I went to the library and picked up the rest of the series to see what happens next.
B000002N2P|5.0|what can i say. i love this band and this is one of my favorite green day records<br />Green Day!!!
B008Y78M60|4.0|Very atmospheric direction that makes the viewer believe you are back in 1865.  Great choice to not focus on the Lincoln's during the assasination (camera never really focuses on their faces).  Mcavoy is awesome & Robin Wright does a good job in representing the appropriate mix of anguis and fate.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|the game keeps crashing and when i do get to play the screen freezes!!!!! i do not reccommend this game!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun! I think everyone should get it! If you like horses this is the perfect game
B00D1DBO1C|4.0|This is a great calendar app that syncs with any or all of your other calendars! I would recommend this app to others.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. its the best so far. way better then all the temple runs combined and I am a big fan of those too.

0345529057|5.0|Love that it is all four vols. in one set. It was great to read before seeing the show. Good background. Will purchase the other two soon. Great story line.

0064431789|5.0|This was my favorite book growing up so I had to buy it for my son. He loves it! Shipping was quick and the packaging was good.
B00AG297GK|5.0|this movie is hilarious. you will laugh your ass off. it is almost as funny or as funny as borat
B007ZXK08C|2.0|This book confused me a little.  I found it quite drawn out, especially for the first half of the book and I found the switching from the present to the future quite frustrating.  The book wasn't bad as I managed to finish it but it wasn't great either
B000MR9D5E|1.0|I ordered this to be a gift for my best friend. This was December 19, 2010. He has yet to receive it. I am just so disappointed. It is 2013. I am afraid to order anything off of Amazon.com now. Its a shame. I feel like its only safe to window shop here. So disappointing, so disappointing.
0440423228|5.0|If you've read a song of ice and fire, you'll love the graphic novel vol 1&2. They over do it with Tyrion's artwork. But still pretty epic.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|I don't know how I missed this show when it first aired.  Caught the first season on Prime and have been hooked the past few weeks.  Just finished up season two last night.  Great action and great plot.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|it kept freezing and at one point wouldn't even open. but once I got it working again it was an overall fun app
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Even I enjoy playing this game, when I can get it away from the kids! I definitely recommend this download!
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Thank you Gavin du Preez for bringing this book to my attention.  Different to many books currently on the market..
B000063V8T|5.0|This item was a gift for my sister. We are all Star Trek fans so we all enjoyed watching it.
B0026WNGBA|4.0|I started running 6 months ago and am 64 yo. At first it was a struggle to run a half mile and I was so out of breath. Now my routine run, 4 times a week, is at least a 5K and I recently ran 2 10Ks. I had a knee operation a few years ago and I thought my running (even jogging) days were over, not that I ran all that much. Following Danny's book I have good form, know what to focus on, have no pain in my knee (or anywhere else), and am working on running faster and farther. My goal when I started was to run a 10K in a year. Who knows, maybe I will aim for a half-marathon. Thanks Danny!
B007R41E8O|4.0|I noticed on many reviews that download time was long.  I had no problems with that.  It took 2 minutes to load onto my Kindle Fire and it worked perfect.  This game was a good adventure game, seek and find with hidden objects.  I gave it 4 stars because some have a little better graphics.  This in no way made the game less enjoyable for me.  I'll be downloading the sequel next.
B00B10CT7A|5.0|Loved watching this move with the whole family. It had a good story and wonderful action. Definitely recommend for anyone.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Requires about 3 GB after all is said and done, but worth it. I'm glad to finally have mtg on my phone. Great campaign ( very similar to what's on xbla ) and deck manager. Looking forward to trying ad hoc multiplayer. Thanks!!
B005KQVDH8|5.0|\\"The kids must've cleaned him out ma.\\"<br />\\"Sure, right before they ate him!\\"<br />The Goonies has to be one of the funniest kid flicks ever made, brimming with wacky observations and withering denouncements.  \\"There's a funny farm somewhere and it's got your names written all over it!\\"<br />Who hasn't wanted to find a treasure map that leads to an exciting quest?  Here's a movie that appeals to every generation with that very premise.  Danger, thrills, a mad dash below ground through passages laced with booby traps that have already taken the life of a `missing' treasure hunter leaving him mere bones.  \\"He's dead for sure!\\"  Throw in a dysfunction family of counterfeiters (complete with a body in their freezer) and you have the right incentive to stay well out in front of what quickly escalates from a simple treasure hunt to a fight for their very lives.  Throw in some bats for good measure plus an unscrupulous land grabber and you have the makings of a classic misadventure.  Starring the mother of any year, Anne Ramsey as Mama Fratelli.  \\"I only dropped you once.  Well.  Maybe twice.\\"  Her feuding sons are played with relish by Robert Davi and Joe Pantoliano (clearly, they have issues).  The cast of kids are exceptional.  It's a fun film from start to finish.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love it but it's crashing constantly now. I can't even get the app to open now very disappointed right now. Hope it gets fixed
B007NWPB4S|5.0|I like the song--it seemed to be 2012's &#34;mantra&#34; song.  I thought, however, there were more songs by Carly Rae on this album.  As it turned out, there was just one.  However, I am glad I purchased it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The best book I have read in a long time. Fast paced.... I couldn't put it Down. I do wish the ending were a little different  I liked the ending, but would have added to it... I won't say how... I don't want to spoil it for anyone.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|This is a non sense movie.Takes forever for something to happen. A waist of time and money, I don't recommend!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|We read this book in Book Club. We all enjoyed the story and the fact that it could be based on true facts. Would recommend it.
B0026772N8|5.0|I read this book for the first time years ago. It's kind of weird to me, since the opening chapter starts right where I grew up. I mean its literally right in my childhood neighborhood, old highway 52 north of Alexandria, MN. At least the location is very nearby, but in my mind, its right there. When I was in the service, in the 80's, a lot of people were reading this. There was a well worn paperback copy making the rounds. I read alot of books back then, but this is one of the ones that I really remember.
B00395ZYVS|3.0|Good book. Read it for Book Club. We all discussed it and we all found it interesting. Would recommend it.
B001TCNSOI|4.0|I though Jolie did some nice work in this off-type role.  Most of the time I trust Eastwood's cinematic choices and I think this one panned out.  I've read some reviews discussing the veracity of the emotionally flat reaction displayed by Jolie's character.  I think that was a director decision and not a blemish on Jolie's performance.  As the four stars indicate, I liked it.
1936608898|5.0|Excellent book. Put me on the path to a new healthier life. Well written, in layman terms so I can understand it.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|After the thrill of his previous books, he'll be hard pressed to provide the excitement again, but I love the way he changes direction and keeps you guessing, page after page! Also, his vocabulary is a challenge - I keep my dictionary handy as I read!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved the movie! My whole family enjoyed watching, can't wait to see the new iron man and the new Thor coming out!
B003008RWA|5.0|this is an eye opener. this movie made me really think about what is going on in America and how our money is being spent.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe is such a great show and this is a perfect gift for the science lovers. I would recommend this product to others
B0064X7FVE|1.0|suddenly my ability to go to tho app and see the weather in my three favorite towns has turned into some kind of &quot;gaming&quot; site! AAAUUGGHH!  I want th old version back.No points no foolishness on social websites.  TOTALLY rediculous.  I will try to contact someone today about this and if I cant get the app that I put in weeks ago I will deleat this today.  Why did they mess up a good thing?
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Everything was perfect! DVDS were everything I knew it would be. For all you FRINGE lovers out there you need to purchase this!
B004H83IM8|5.0|I had seen the 1st one more than once, the 2nd one 2 times and the 3rd one bits and pieces of it. Once I got done watching the whole saga (with Mom)I felt happy and...Groovy Baby Yeah. Don't freak out if you feel like &#34;Shagging&#34; after watching this movie, lol. Awesome addition to anybody's DVD collection IF you like comedy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it, ended up playing for hours. Picture is amazing on my new kindle fire HD. This game rocks, can't wait to play it again.
B00190OHD6|5.0|Well...I actually never saw the &#34;Digital Version&#34;...just waited for the actual DVD to show up in the mail and when it did...Mom was excited and so was I. I know this may be a girlie movie but...guys...if you want a lady to like you, you have to show a little passion and a couple of tears. I love ALL types of movies and when we=Mom and I, were done watching this not only was she sentimental, I was crying myself. I suffer from MS and I just put myself in the shoes of the male character(Gerard Butler). Movie is worth it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it crashes often. other than tht its rlly fun... the crashing needs to b fixed... it like temple run and it challenging
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My Brothers son (my Nephew) was playing the 1st one on his iPod Touch when I was visiting him in Texas and I was wondering what in the world he was doing, tilting the device left and right and acting like kids do, yelling at the game &#34;no not that way this way, jump, wow too fast, oh I fell...&#34; stuff like that and I was curious about it. Once I saw THIS(part 2)I was excited and turned into a 8 year old myself yelling &#34;no not that way this way, jump, wow too fast, oh I fell...oh well, start over...&#34;. Warning...this is a highly addictive game you WILL be playing it for at least an hour if not more, lol.
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|I have to be honest, I have not found the time to read the book, but I have a teenage daughter who reads all day every day.  I bought the book to read myself and she immediately showed great interest in the book so I gave it to her to read. Within two hours she had finished the book and  asked me if there were more books in the series.  We have been patiently waiting for the second book to come out. I also had another adult friend who was reading the book at the same time as my daughter and she said that from page one she just couldn't put the book down until she had finished it. That is amazing that this story appeals to people of all ages, young and old. We are hoping that the story line from Outview will evolve into a series!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was better then I expected. It was Interesting and entertaining. Can't wait for more rooms.highly recommend to kill time.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I know you can watch DHS-AB online for free. However, this disk has what the internet doesn't: not one, but TWO commentaries. One serious one with the actors and Joss, and the second is called &#34;Commentary: The Musical.&#34; with songs such as &#34;$10 solo&#34; &#34;Ninja Ropes&#34; and &#34;Better Than Neil&#34; which are hilarious. There are also behind the scenes and application videos to the ELE. It's a great value, and I highly recommend it.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|The person who I bought the movie for really enjoys it. She enjoys it so much that she watches a lot. Sometimes I wish I could get into movies like this. I just do not know how individuals can get into movies like Twilight
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love this show, and the boxed season did not disappoint. It has high quality disks, commentaries, extras, and fun pictures. All in all, a good purchase.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love Jurassic park builder it is fun.  I love seeing all the different animals it comes up with.  It keeps you guessing on what is next
0785168109|5.0|From the first Iron Man art book to the third one. They just keep getting more amazing. The book is so beautifully put together. THIS AND THE FIRST 2 ARE A MUST FOR IRON MAN FANS! Really this book from cover to cover has been made with incredible craftsmanship.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is awesome<br /><br />Ben<br />Hmmmm<br />I wonder for the Bob carl Zeiss the best bakery EVER since he was rather than just a little bit about the rather than that is awesome job of keeping up with a new comment your own
B0026P3G12|5.0|This lady has a beautiful voice and plenty of power when she needs it.  Loved all the songs.  She made each one her own very special way of singing them.  Love the Silent Night at the end.  Lovely Album recommend it to everyone who loves music.  Fast delivery and it was in excellent condition.  Can't wait to order all of her CD's.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|I wish Hollywood grow out of that xenophobic feature of assigning random eastern-European accents to villains. Gru has a Russian (?) accent that Steve Carell probably heard somewhere. Growing up in the cold-war era, I understood the trend, just like 50's cartoon villains had German accents. But why now, in the PC era, we hear that hateful cliche? Gru's mother has an American east-coast Yiddish accent, for some strange reason. I don't know why Julie Andrews chose that one. She didn't have an Austrian accent in another movie... Either way, inconsistent, hurtful and overall stupid.<br />Other than that Mrs Lincoln, cute movie, no more. I hear the sequel is more adult-friendly.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I am in currently in active duty military and I enjoyed this book so much I've got two other military members reading it. Chris shows humor history and heroism through his story and the struggle between military families and deployment.
075666733X|5.0|Loved the book. It's the first one of it's kind that I've ever purchased. Also bought the one on the human brain. Very informative books and helpful when investigating the different parts of the body. Recommend to anyone who is interested the hows and whys of the human body.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Very addictive game. I wish we could sell back our items from the stash if we no longer desired them.
B002JWD6AS|3.0|Good.  A good book for young adults.needs more cliffhangers. I gave this book this rating because I like this book, but don't plan on reading it a second time
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|Like many of those who have an interest in this era I'm sure; I approached The Pacific with the outstanding Band of Brothers (BoB) series in mind. While The Pacific doesn't quite compare with BoB in a number of ways, primarily due to the difference in source material used, it is still a great rendition of the experiences of Marines during WWII. Instead of getting to know almost everybody involved, as you do in BoB, The Pacific is a convergence of a few biographies/autobiographies by or about three Marines whom the series identifies as the main characters. You do certainly learn the names of other characters, but that's only through the interaction of the focused few.<br /><br />I have had the pleasure of reading one of the books this series was based on, Helmet for My Pillow by Robert Leckie, and although it was an excellent read, making it part of a series like this one may not have been their best choice; due to it being all one person's point of view and not translating well to a non-documentary format in parts. That was one of the many things that made BoB so great IMO; the fact that the information was coming from practically an entire company. Going the route of The Pacific made for a slower, more dramatized experience. I don't mean to imply that as a bad thing, I just want those who haven't seen it to know what to expect.<br /><br />I'm willing to bet that the majority of people interested in war stories care less about watching soldiers spending time at an insane asylum, or becoming a poster-boy to sell war bonds, than they do about seeing the combat and the heroics surrounding it. I'm not saying all the other stuff should be left out, and as a veteran myself I understand very well what goes on 'behind the scenes' as it were, but unlike BoB I felt that there were several scenes that could've been edited to allow for more time on the battlefield, such as Guadalcanal. For example, large sections of parts 3 & 4 felt like filler to me and could've easily been cut down to one chapter; not cutting scenes completely mind you, just made shorter while still getting the point across. Leave those details for readers who prefers to expand on these experiences through the books.<br /><br />Despite all this, I still very much enjoyed The Pacific and admit that most of the criticisms I've made are relatively minor, especially when looking at it under its own merits and not compared to Band of Brothers. I highly recommend watching this series at least once to anyone who are WWII aficionados or simply interested in getting a closer look into the lives of a few Marines during their time across the Pacific.t down to one chapter; not cutting scenes completely mind you, just made shorter while still getting the point across.

B000QCS8TW|5.0|Move over I, Robot, The Hobbit, and Dune.  There is a newcomer into the pantheon of great multi book series.  Game of Thrones is not science fiction, or pure fantasy/allegory.  It is just a wonderful story with multiple plot lines woven together in a beautifully written style that makes this, the first book in the series an absolute page turner.  Combining all the palace intrigue of the English court in the 17th century, with the fantasy warriors of Tolkien, this book will grab you, hold you, and then leave you wanting more.  Can't wait to read the second volume.
B00BWDJILG|4.0|Joshua Redman plays very well on this album and it is very great! Not like the old Redman stuff, but still swingin!
B00AB55BS0|5.0|I love this show!!! It's full of suspense, action and romance. You never know what's going to happen. Can't wait to see what happens.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Big and loud blockbuster with a great cast of Marvel characters doing what they do best. Plus Samuel L is there!
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|it was a fantastic game until I tried to play and it keeps going back yo my home screen. I'm unable to play now.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy this app because it is for kids and adults.out of all the apps I own, this one is the hardest one.This app also can help you to relax in stressful times (Trust me, it does!!!) I would recommend this game to people who like thinking games!!!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This game is fun because you can see your battles and use abilities to change the course of the battle
B000005YZM|5.0|This album comes together like few albums do, in the way that there are only a couple songs that don't blow my mind like the rest do.  It is an absolutely stunning album and you can play it again and again and it won't get old!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is fun I play it tell I go to bed.it gose fast so it is hard to keep track of but still fun
B003730LRY|5.0|Exactly, what I thought it would be! I was entertained and so were the grand-kids. I have a Prime account so no added costs.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Freak weather app for my Kindle.  The radar feature is perfect when severe weather is headed our way.  We have satalite Tv, but the Internet always works and Accuweather is great for when the television is out.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Exactly, what I thought it would be! I was entertained and so were the grand-kids. I have a Prime account so no added costs.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|The game is a blast but very repetitive......I was told that a friend of mine got one automatically on his phone......not one for the kindle fire?

B00BSO2U1Y|2.0|I had high expectations for this album and was so excited when I read about it.  I was tremendously disappoined when I heard it.  While the opera is well sung, it comes across as an odd version of &#34;Norma&#34;.  Most of the music is familiar, but there is a certain amount that is not, at least what we have accepted over the years.  Different is not necessarily better, and I can't imagine lovers of this great opera loving this version.  Sumi Jo is wonderful as Adalgisa, but Bartoli misses the mark as Norma.  There were times she sang as if she were singing Rossini, truly her forte, but Bellini is not Rossini.  For me, I'll stick with Callas, Sutherland and Caballe for my Norma's and the accepted musical version will always be music to my ears.  This is an album you might want in your collection because it is different, but probably won't listen to very often.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|dude this game is awesome I love dispicable me I want to see dispicable me 2 I have not seen it yet
0783229526|5.0|One of my favorite movies, I sat on pins and needles waiting on it... it plays great, just as advertised
B003M6EAXM|5.0|Excellent last series. Jack takes matters into his own hands after his love Michelle is killed by the sniper. It was sad to see the series end. I am hearing that there may be another 24. I am all in to that. The writers of 24 do such an excellent job of spinning the yarn. All the action and sub-plots are so engrossing.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|i love Neil Gaiman's writing. Some of his books I like more than others, and this is one of those! It has its mysteries and unanswered questions, and is so beautifully written in the voice of a child that was, and still lives inside of us all. Remember the strange things that happened in your childhood, the things no one could explain? This is that book, and it makes you remember things, too. Thank you, Mr. Gaiman, for sharing your lovely talent. More, please.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app, I use it every time I go anywhere I have to stay in a hotel. It's easy to use and has many options. I truly love a good app.

B00BFUUMO8|1.0|If you do not have your account linked with Facebook then the update will delete everything. My father was level 26 and he had to update and he doesn't have a Facebook account. When the update went through and he opened it up he lost everything. Big oversight on the makers part!!!
B001NKI60W|5.0|I watched this movie a few years back and fell in love with it.  Love the acting and the music.  Great fun watch
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a wonderful story set in a historical time in England, love all of the characters and the shock of loosing one of the stars was totally unexpected.  Looking forward to seeing the next season.  Love prime..
B000ICZD5M|5.0|I remember watching this movie when it first came out and was just impressed.  I am happy to finally have my own copy.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|One of the best, liked everything about it. The plot is unique, the special effects are over the top, and the cast is first rate. This has become a perennial watch it again movie.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|One of the best nighttime dramas on television. Legal eagles do the dirty to their opponents and each other. Great acting.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I fell in love with this book. Very emotional but very touching too. I would recommend this book too everyone I know
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A fascinating and entertaining story lines.  Good actors except for the actress that plays Cora.  She always has her head tilted down or to the side.  Not sure if that is part of the character or some sort of tick.  That gets a bit annoying, but everything else is great!
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Instead of looking as a journalist, a general, or a politician this book sees combat through the eyes of private.  A very informative book.
B000000OR9|5.0|I reserve 5 stars for albums in my collection that I keep returning to again and again, and this is one such album.<br /><br />Originally, I received this as a vinyl copy from a record club back in the 80s because I failed to mail in the slip with the 'don't want' checkbox checked, so I had no expectations when I received it.  I knew it was a John Sykes project initiated just after he was given a pink slip from Whitesnake, who at the time were achieving worldwide fame.  One listen of this record though convinced me it should have been the other way around.<br /><br />With then not-as-big Bob Rock at the helm, John Sykes (vocals, guitars), Carmine Appice (drums), and Tony Franklin (bass) put out a near perfect combination of prog-rock musicianship, blues/pop-rock sensibility, and heavy metal impact.  Musically, my best description of the overall sound is that it combines a hard-rock Zeppelin style sensibility with Dio and a little Whitesnake pop sensibility thrown in.  Check out the samples and you'll get the idea.<br /><br />\\"Riot\\" starts things off rocking right away on an anthemic and almost danceable feel and straight off the bat showcases each of the players unique talents, which seques brilliantly into the slightly more funk-oriented \\"Sex Child\\".  Both songs feature some nice orchestrated keyboard work.  We then go into \\"Valley of the Kings\\" - and yes, there is a heavy Zeppelin influence in this arena prog anthem.  It took me a couple listens to get into it, but it contains some brilliant bridges and a nice harmonized outro.<br /><br />Then the one downside - \\"Jelly Roll\\" is sort of a mid-tempo boom-clap acoustic number that is a bit less to my taste.  It does add some needed breathing space after 3 intense rockers, but frankly it's the one I find myself skipping a lot of the time.<br /><br />Fear not though, as things pick right back on what is the most accessible song of this album - \\"Blue Murder\\".  Again, the band sets aside their considerable chops to deliver a hard-hitting anthemic arena rocker complete with a shout-along chorus - \\"He's screaming... Blue Murder .... / I'm scheming to Survive\\".  Like all songs to this point, it builds on layers as it goes - starting off relatively simply with just the guitar, bass, and voice and then layering additional synths and complexity.  It is this element that keeps things interesting.<br /><br />This leads into the first true ballad - \\"Out of Love\\", which showcases John Sykes' voice and allows some of the more orchestral elements of the arrangements to shine through.  The ballads in general around this period were always my least favorite element of a metal album.  Used mostly by bands trying to score additional radio play with female audiences, ballads were typically simplistic and more often than not seemed uncharacteristic of a bands sound.  \\"To Be with You\\" by  Mr. Big or \\"More than Words\\" by Extreme come to mind.  \\"Billy\\", however, successfully keeps within the theme of the album.  It sounds big, has a complex arrangement, and builds to a climax from a simple acoustic riff.  It, of course, got very little radio play.<br /><br />The last 2 selections on this record round thing out nicely, with another prog-rock anthem \\"Ptolemy\\" that further showcases the talent of the excellent musicianship on this record, followed immediately by the final track and the most energetic rocker on this record - \\"Black Hearted Woman\\".<br /><br />Some notes on production -<br />While the mix is good and you can hear everything clearly, this record had a mix similar to the Whitesnake self-titled effort (the hit making one, not the debut) - which is to say it was a little compressed and seemingly loud in places, though not distorted.  It is definitely not a clean - dry mix, but it does suit the content of the album.  One of the things I like about it is that you can here Tony Franklin's bass real well, which is fine - because his fret-less bass playing on this record is spectacular and should beshowcased.  It does at times take front and center in the mix adding a claustrophobic element to the experience.  Also, in my opinion, the cymbals on the drum kit are a little too bright.  However, these are minor quibbles.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Blue Murder would not record another album for quite some time, and the eventual follow-up \\"Nothin But Trouble\\" is unfortunately not in the same league as this release.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|They sound just like they are back in the 70s  with a lot of rimming. It's very old school sound.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Everyone calls this retro, whatever.  This game is great fun; no joystick required!  I've had it for a few weeks and play it almost daily for 2 or 3 games. I can usually get into the upper levels, but JUST got to level 79 w/ 19,000,000 points. Woot!<br /><br />On my tablet (Nexus 7) this game plays excellently; on my Razr Maxx not quite as well.  It's still playable, it's just not quite as fast.  Above level 30 or so you tend to have a lot of pixels running around the screen and it sometimes is a little much for the phone.<br /><br />Most other reviewers have captured the look/feel so I'll let their reviews speak.<br /><br />Enjoy.
B005F3GMAO|5.0|I find this to be a fantastic book. Lots of good advice. Lots of great words and recommendations. Buy it.
B009RH973I|4.0|Nothing fancy or spectacular but it does it's job and provides some lightweight protection.  Minimal bulk added to the Kindle.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|!!Very happy with this game must play you will be very happy<br />Must get it I can't stop playing do it!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|We have always given feedback for purchases in the past, but now they require a minimum number of words. It is too time consuming to write a review for all of the many purchases we buy on Amazon. So, to sum it up that we liked this product.
B00CJ4OMO0|4.0|The scenery is fantastic.  O'Toole is perfect for role.  I do not know how accurate the history is, but I plan to read more on it.
B008C0C1Y8|2.0|What happens when they take a classic comic book character and give it to someone who doesn't care about him?<br /><br />Well, this is what happens.<br /><br />Having come out just after Demolition Man, I had some hope for this Stallone portrayal but this is a Stallone movie, not a Dredd movie. Even the slipcover has Stallone's name in bigger print than the character's and shows Stallone's face. In nearly 40 years of stories, Dredd has never shown his face. This is a middle-of-the-road Stallone showcase.<br /><br />Not worth buying, hardly worth watching when it's run on TV.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and avoid this movie and check out the Karl Urban version instead.
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|This movie is different, buy nice. I love the special effects and the exotic scenes. Consider that this movie is sci fi, so the hole plot is not realistic. In summary, an enjoyable movie.
B00BWJARHO|2.0|So if you've seen any of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, you've seen The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.  While some of the actors and sets have changed, it's really the exact same thing as any of The Lord of The Rings movies.  Which if you like those, you'll like these.  I happen to think they're pompous, way too long and boring.  I can't stress boring enough.  There needs to be solid character development in a movie, and I just don't like these characters.  That's not to say that Ian McKellan or Martin Freeman or most of the others give a bad performance, I just don't care about Hobbits and Dwarves and Orc's enough to get in to these films.  My wife loves the books and while they were ground breaking (back in the day) I just never got into them.<br />In this installment it's the back story of Bilbo Baggins and how he came into possession of the one ring.  We see Gollum again, as well as a few other familiar faces (the Elves and some of the Dwarves).  Once again a faction of the races set off on an adventure to save Middle Earth from a problem.  In this case it's to reclaim the Dwarves homeland after a particularly nasty dragon decides to take over their realm and horde the gold.<br />While Peter Jackson is a fine director, I'm just tired of these characters and the same old shtick.  While there are certain things I can never get enough of, The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings should have stopped 3 movies ago.  Just my two cents.
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is a great Blu-ray of the series. The extras on the disc are great and plenty to watch. A lot of the episodes have commentary witch is a nice cool feature.
B00280LYIC|5.0|We have always given feedback for purchases in the past, but now they require a minimum number of words. It is too time consuming to write a review for all of the many purchases we buy on Amazon. So, to sum it up that we liked this product.
0375850864|4.0|When I started reading When You Reach Me, I had no idea what it was about. I had heard good reviews from multiple people and that was the sole reason for my decision to read this novel.<br /><br />Miranda is a 6th grader who lives with her mom in New York City. I loved the descriptions of the Laughing Man, of her work experience at the sandwich shop, of her classmates; they added a whole new dimension to the story. I was able to really visualize the scenery in my head. When You Reach Me was also interesting because it takes place over 1978 and 1979. Society is so different today, and it was fascinating to see the differences.<br /><br />I absolutely loved the incorporation of A Wrinkle In Time. While I was reading this book, I was a little disappointed because it seemed like a cute story, but kind of shallow. I didn't understand what made this book pop out to other people. until the very end. So, if you are reading this and having similar thoughts, keep reading. The end of this book is incredible.<br /><br />I did predict who the Laughing Man was, and who Miranda was writing her letter too. However, this did not affect my enjoyment of the novel or it's ending.<br /><br />So, long story short, READ THIS BOOK. This novel is appropriate for middle-school age kids, but I believe teens and adults will also enjoy it as well.
B005LAII80|4.0|After the awful Stallone movie of a couple of decades back, a Dredd movie that's true to the original material. Ultra-violent so be forewarned but a good rendition and a well paced (if somewhat predictable) story line. Good for some escapism but don't buy if you don't like on-screen violence.
B003DO13O2|5.0|For those who may be confused on this point, thanks to Amazon's aggravating habit of aggregating reviews from completely different editions of a particular CD or DVD:  The Mercury Records \\"Deluxe Edition\\", UMC 532 675-4, released in 2010, *does* indeed contain the honest-to-god ORIGINAL 1974 MIX, just like it was first released on vinyl, on the second CD of the set.  I can say this for a fact, as I still *have* my vinyl copy, so I was able to compare the bits that I knew had been changed in the 1976 remix (made for the \\"Boxed\\" LP set) that ended up being used for the CD releases afterwards, and all the bits that are missing from that mix are indeed present on the \\"Original 1974 Stereo Mixes\\" versions on this CD set.<br /><br />And about bloody time, too!  I remember being *so* disappointed when \\"Hergest Ridge\\" came out on CD back in the 80s, and I got my copy home and discovered that it didn't sound at all like the album I knew.  At first, I thought perhaps the disc had just been mastered incorrectly, but then I figured out what had happened when I remembered that it sounded a lot like the \\"Boxed\\" LP version (which I also had, but hadn't liked as much and didn't listen to).  Ever since then, I've been treating my '74 LP like it was a Faberge egg while hoping that maybe the *next* CD reissue would get it right, only to be disappointed when every re-release had that same '76 remix...<br /><br />But, seeing that this one explicitly stated it had the original '74 mix, and that some of the reviews seemed to confirm it, I decided to take a chance on this one and order it.  Fans of Mike Oldfield, rest assured, someone *finally* came to their senses and got the REAL \\"Hergest Ridge\\" out on CD at last!  (I'm guessing the switch to Mercury Records had a lot to do with this; everything I've read suggests that Virgin Records didn't seem to have a lot of use for Oldfield after a certain point, even though they probably made more money off his \\"Tubular Bells\\" than just about anything else they ever put out.)<br /><br />The 2010 remix Oldfield did for this release is all right as well -- at least, I'd say it's superior to the disappointingly stripped-down \\"Boxed\\" remix -- but it'll never quite measure up to the original, at least for me. :)  I don't really have the equipment to properly judge the 5.1 surround-sound mix, so I'll leave that to someone else -- but honestly, I would have paid twice as much as this just to get the '74 mix alone.  This has definitely made me interested in picking up the rest of the \\"Deluxe\\" releases of Oldfield's catalog.  Well done, Mercury!
B009CF3P7E|4.0|When it was first announced that they were going to remake Star Trek I was kind of indifferent.  I had never really enjoyed the original show or any of the spin offs and movies they produced.  However when J.J. Abrams was announced as director, it piqued my interest.  Then they cast Zachary Quinto as Spock, Karl Urban as Bones, Simon Pegg as Scotty and as yet unknown to me, Chris Pine as Captain Kirk.  Each actor/actress gives a fine performance, with the ones I previously stated as my favorites.  The story is fantastic and the visuals are stunning.  I definitely enjoyed this more than any of the previous shows/films (save for Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and that's more for the unintentional humor between Kirk and Khan) and couldn't wait to see what the sequel brought.  If you like sci-fi, solid acting, a great script or just want to be taken away to another dimension, watch Star Trek (2009) and enjoy.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great movie on blue ray. Love watching this on a pretty regular basis. The extras on the Blu-ray are great and fun to watch
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game has good hidden objects graphics. The puzzles are easier than some, and can be skipped if desired. Overall, an enjoyable way to spend some time.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A pleasant, sometimes funny, at times poignant look at how we close ourselves off from new possibilities by holding on and creating a shrine to who we once were. An enjoyable film.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|It has been a little while since I watched this movie, but what stood out to me was that the boy invovled in \\"pretent son\\" scheme was a loner that desperately needed a friend, which was not expected from the adult schemer.<br />Unfortunately there are too many kids that don't and can't fit in with kids their own age so they reach out or want to reach out to an adult as a substitude for what they can't find with kids. I dont recommend such, since it can cause problems but i don't  discourage it either since I know of the necessity.
B00785P2QC|3.0|You get your city going and to keep it growing , you can't earn fast enough without having to purchase more money to advance.  Your garbage routes are hard to keep picked up. Everytime you quit playing and go back you have to go in and pickup a bunch of garbage to catch up. And I could never get my environment level out of the red....Ned some help hints.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show, always keeps me on my toes. Very excited for the next season. One of the better zombie shows/movies I seen.
B003AO1SVS|4.0|It arrived in a timely fashion. It has good tunes on it. It was not in one of those hard-to-open plastic boxes.
B003B02OOG|2.0|Some of the stories were excellently written and &#34;cast&#34;.  For the most part, the stories tell of people who are stuck in their own world with little hope, or seeming desire, to get out.  Not a fun read.
0670026638|5.0|This is one of the few books I have read that have deeply moved me.  I am not exactly sure why.  But it is a very moving, sad, but ultimately uplifting book.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|I'm just reading this for fun.  The movie was a blast.  I like Kurt Vonnegut and Harlan Ellison. Good Price.  Nice Product
B005PK57IK|5.0|Watched all available seasons. I stream all of my television shows. Loved the drama! Anxiously waiting on the next season!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|It's a great tool to keep me organized! It's a calendar and a notepad in one. I use it a lot.
B00BEXB18M|5.0|I've been a Megadeth fan for a long time and I'm thoroughly convinced Dave doesn't make a bad album. There are those that disagree, I'm sure, but I even think there's a lot to like about Risk. Super Collider delivers signature Megadeth sound and feel without retreading previous work and manages to offer something new and exciting without wandering into uncharacteristic territory.  The album is laced with catchy chorus work, tricky riffs, sweet solos, and as always has at least one uptempo song that really cooks. In particularly I'm impressed with Super Collider, Beginning of Sorrow, and Don't Turn Your Back, but the whole album flows nicely. Just get it, it won't disappoint.
B008WZHWCE|4.0|Had low expectations, but we really liked it!  Worth a look.  Expect the unexpected, because what you think is happening is usually wrong.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|... I LOVE the Minions!  But, I downloaded it this morning and it just kept taking me in circles... refused to open, etc.  Had to uninstall it.  Really bummed as those that are able to play it are really enjoying it...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have spent countless hours playing this game. It is soooooooo addicting. There is only one thing I don't like about this game, though. You only get 4 of the 7 characters you did in the first one.
B00CFAHSEO|5.0|I watched some of their videos and got hooked.  I have other music by John Schmidt and like it.  I bought the download so I can listen to it whenever I wanted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is really fun I cant stop playing it. So yeah I love it .it is like gold silver and bronze so each person could have that
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Hard to put it down! Definiteley keeps me occupied. Love the animations of the animsls. If you touch the animals they do funny things.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I am in complete agreement with the other reviewers of the lastest update.. it's not good!  The background images make the info unreadable and cannot be manually changed.  The Mpoints stuff looks promising but when I try to log in with my facebook account for some reason the keyboard won't come up on my kindle fire.  It's supposed to come up automatically when you tap in the fill-in field but it doesn't!  So.. how are you supposed to log in without the keyboard?!  It DOES work normally everywhere else or I couldn't have wrote my review!  I really hope they go back to the drawing board on this one..
B000VWYJ8G|5.0|take notes hollywood. not many movies these days that claim to be action are truly action. it's more 10% action and the rest is CGI. this movie is truly awesome.<br />for fans of the trilogy no just to flat out ignore the mediocre 'the bourne legacy'. without matt damon it should just be a stand alone film. quit using 'BOURNE' in the title to reel in potential viewers to blow they're money on a film that tarnishes the trilogy.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|I never got this to download so I really don't know how it is. Based on other reviews though, it sounds fun.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its good because its fun. it just downloaded to much.but it is really intertwining. it like temple run and subway surfers.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I saw all of the good reviews on this app and it looked like fun so I decided to download it. After downloading it, I was able to play it on and off all day yesterday, then I went to play it this morning and it shut me straight out of the app. After trying it over and over again and it still booted me out, so I uninstalled it. Great game over all, I just wish it wouldn't kick me out when I try to use it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was engaged up to the very last word of the book.  Really enjoyed it but I will warn you the ending is unexpected!
B00AVFO41K|3.0|Not sure about normal difficulty, but on easy right now I've scored &gt;5000 points with still three quarters of the board empty and more than 5 rainbow balls at my disposal
0375869026|5.0|Best book I've read in a long time!  The author helps you see that behind every face (deformed or otherwise) there is a real person with feelings and personality.  We all need to take the time to get to know people on the level that only a very few people came to know August.  Our lives would all be enriched by such friendships.  This is a gripping book ---I laughed and I cried ---A must read for every young person, while adults can learn from and enjoy as well.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I spent hours solving these Sudoku Puzzles. You never seem to run out. If you really like Sudoku, buy this app.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Tom Cruise's  character was a surprise for me.<br />I rate this one right up there with his better movies.<br />Watch it and see for yourself. . . .
B005D9MUWY|4.0|A little invasive in regards to the statistics updates and constant reminders to write a review. I do like the ability to swipe or type regularly and not make too many mistakes.  Best keyboard app by a long shot.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|EVER SINCE THE FIRST MOVIE I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FOR AWESOME GAMES AND SUCH. THIS IS GREAT! Please keep up the awesome games GameLoft
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This looks like a fun game and it may be but it isnt working at all.  I click on it ir looks like it is loading but just stays on the same place and does nothing.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Having been a great fan of Smallville for a long time, I did not even hesitate when purchasing this collection. Like my expectations, I believe that the layout of the box set was reasonable. Another great aspect of it was the special features and extras that came with it. My favourite item was the real copy of a Daily Planet newspaper, a must-have for every Smallville fan!
B00026WU64|5.0|Despite my age (70), I never llistened much to Bob Dylan's music, mainly because it wasn't played much on the radio.<br />When I had the song &#34;dont look back its allright&#34;stuck in my head for whatever reason, I decided to get his album which contained<br />the song. I'm fascinated by his style of singing, like all his fans of the last 40 yrs. Just dissappointed it took me so long to appreciate it. The album is clear as a bell-no distortion.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|im in love with this tv show i watch it all the time and i never get bored of it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love but I mean love this game so much I got it yesterday and I'm addicted to it. that's how fun it is!!!:))))
B00124PXW8|5.0|Magic.  So much better when a director has a budget and time constraint forcing him to make-do and improvise rather than over-indulge.
0307276902|5.0|This book is an amazing account of a troubled time in James' life. The outcome is nothing but admirable and commendable.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Hans Zimmer did a great job with this soundtrack. I thought it was even better themed than the TDK scores :)
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I wish there were more stories like this one, told in this way. Economical and well-wrought prose. A straightforward but compelling plot. Sentiment without tackiness. Good honest fun.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It was visually pleasing as well as challenging. Good way to kill a bit of time. Looking forward to the next!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I enjoy reading these novels and though it’s only the 2nd one in the series I’ll come back for more.<br /><br />Since the 4th of July has just past this book seems appropriate. Jack Stops to help a young woman that he’s bumped into, just as she’s about to be kidnaped, Jack becomes a pawn in a situation that may cause this nation, along with himself, a lot of grief. A power mad militia man wants out of the United States and thinks that this woman can be useful.<br /><br />Lee Child makes his characters strong and with lots emotions. The twists and turns are good and subtle. The plots are well thought out and involved. Jack is very good at solving them. The only real problem I have, while understanding Jack’s need to be free of normal conventions, is, well he’s basically an itinerant man… in used clothing… who always seems to get the hot babe. They have fun (or romance) in a stressful situation and then she walks away with no qualms or regrets. Really? First off the hot babe won’t usually go for someone with no means of support and no plan for the future, much less the next day. He’s not Tom Cruise either. I’m just saying it does stretch things just a bit. BUT the books are good.
B0095EMOTM|3.0|Some of them, I love it (songs); But, others ruin the compilation. And comes the cd without a box. I'm upset when happen that. Very good for David Guetta.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great read! The thoughts and emotions of Katness are very well conveyed. An imaginative piece of fiction that shows bravery and determination in the face of incredible difficulties.
B000SGSU58|5.0|Michael Connelly is an excellent writer and Harry Bosch is my Hero.  He is human but yet not quite.<br />This was an excellent mystery
B002E0JL4A|5.0|This movie can change your vision of the real life. Laughing is the best medicine, it is so real, just try it and you can see the diferences.

B007L6VR12|5.0|This is a delightful story that is full of interesting characters. It's beautifully filmed and lots of fun to watch.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love the series!! I love classical stories, and romance. It's a must watch show - don't miss out, it will captivate you.
B00CEF014E|3.0|My Favorite Lines:<br /><br />\\"All that she could see was dirt fields stretching to the horizon. She steadied herself, reeling, dissolving into madness.\\"<br /><br />\\"The sun shone gently in a clear blue sky, spreading its tendrils over a lush, vibrant garden teeming with life, situated atop a cliff, offering a spectacular view of the Pacific.\\"<br /><br />What I Thought:<br /><br />This book was definitely unlike any other book I've ever read. I could definitely see it making a very good movie, with the descriptive way the author writes making it easy to envision everything as you go along.<br /><br />The book was very past-paced and well-written. It's important to pay close attention as you read, because things have a tendency to change quickly, and sometimes it's hard to tell what is really happening, and what isn't. But because this book is a psychological thriller, that is definitely the point.<br /><br />This book is a good read for anyone who wants to read something that is different from anything else they've ever picked up. Fans of `Shutter Island' by Dennis Lehane would very much appreciate it, as it takes a similar approach in exploring whether something is reality or not.<br /><br />There was a twist that I was no expecting at all, towards the end of the novella. I love a book with a twist, so that was pretty exciting for me.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the book and as it's very different from what I usually read, it was a bit refreshing. I'd definitely see the film version if that would ever come to be.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I had no intention of binging on Eureka... just wanted to see what it was about.  But this show sucked me in from the very first pilot episode.  Characters are very likeable.  Excellent writing.  Very intelligent.  And incredibly fun show to watch.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Although the book is definitely focused on some bizarre behavior and I found many similarities to the Twilight Saga I enjoyed reading all three books.
B006R8GK2Q|2.0|GLITCHES! At every corner they lurk. My screen gets stuck in the antique store backdrop no matter what area the scene actually should be. The items to locate are there which is bizarre without the correct scene and it still plays through but dissent get me out of the room.  Worse, the entire scene will turn into a mish mash of pixels sometimes if it happens I'm no in wireless mode.  I am determined to play this game through. Just now reloaded the whole thing to see if that cures the problem. I really like the variety of the searches but that is a big &quot;so what?&quot; to me if I never can finish the game  and really! If I was at 30 thou. feet in a plane where I often find myself I wouldn't be able to play this if it required an online connection. Buyer beware
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and truly enjoyed the great CGI!  If you are a fan of &#34;Fantasy&#34; movie buff, (like I am) you will enjoy this movie!

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|this game is the best game on earth!!!!!'the graffics are<br />really good and unlike most other games there is non<br />fictional stuff. the fishes are really cool looking mostly.<br />fishes I have never heard of. good for children. and adults. plus the music is soothing
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I recently download the game and I was anxious to play and when the loading screen is done. Then I pop back at the home page.
B00447G29S|1.0|The most important fact about this is that it's not the kind of 3-D you think it is.  It's the old school type with red and blue glasses.  Which don't work very well.  I'm unsure if you'd even need a 3-D player for it.  I didn't like the movie either, the characters were all very disturbing to me in appearance and it feels like they used a very old animation style that was really antiquated even before this film was put together.  The story is happy, but I honestly found the 'don't think, just believe' to be a bit heavy handed and a poor message overall for adults with half a brain or children of average intelligence or better.  If you're looking for a legit 3-D movie, this isn't really a 3-D movie, and the movie itself is a 3 star film on a good day.  Buyer beware.

B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Its a great game when it works.  I got it and it worked for 3 days then it would not open past the universal studio page.  I uninstalled it and re-installed it and it worked for a few days then did the same thing and would get past the universal studio page.  I have a Galaxy Note 2.  Please fix as me and my 6 year old daughter both like it when it works
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great graphics. Horse is very realistic. Seems fun so far , but will have to see how far you can go without spending real money. The coins seem pretty easy to earn, but you need gems for higher quality items and horse feed.

B00CWY76CC|4.0|this is way more fun than 100 elevators because you have to actually find objects to escape the room instead of just find the button to open the elevator. It's not too challenging but I have already had to stop and think a few times about how to make certain objects work. I anxiously await the release of more levels.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was so inspiring for me. This was a mandatory book MY school told me to read which is Dexter School. I have learned a lot from this book.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|It was much like the others, I personally prefer stories that move swiflty even with the \\"love scenes\\" this series doesn't seem to do that. It honestly reminds me too much of fifty shades..but that won't keep me from reading more. I enjoy the visuals:)

0385368267|5.0|I listened to the audio book version of Eleanor and Park. The reason is that it was all the library had. But it was a lucky thing for me. The narrators took a wonderful story and made it an experience I won't soon forget.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|Last week this app was working with occasional crashes. Today I can't get it to work at all without crashing on my Kindle Fire HD.<br /><br />The best that I can say is that it sometimes works.
B00BSBU4EC|3.0|We rented this video through Amazon Prime and enjoyed the movie however, the audio was not great.  We used headphones while watching this movie and the music audio was much louder than the voice audio.  We had to keep adjusting the volume whenever the music came on which took away from the movie.  The movie itself had a good storyline and my kids enjoyed watching it.  Would watch this movie again.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|There was a lot of great action and special effects in this movie. I hadn't seen it in the movies but enjoyed watching it on my Kindle Fire.

0800141849|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! If I get a day off and am around the house this is the movie to see.  Jeff Bridges and all the supporting cast are priceless. A classic!
0399536108|5.0|I first read this book at a time when I was stuck in a job that I didn't want to be in. I was unhappy, gaining weight, and spending myself into debt, which all turned out to be coping mechanisms for an unfulfilling life. Since I read the book, I quit my job, traveled to 40 plus countries, and figured out how to make money on my own from anywhere in the world. This book alone probably won't get you to that point, but it is absolutely the motivation you need to get things kicked off, and start making the life you want.

0765350386|5.0|Mistborn is a trilogy by Brandon Sanderson, and I really enjoyed it. There are several compelling protagonists in each book, plenty of philosophical questions, and an interesting world.<br /><br />The setting is a broken world. Ash rains from the sky, mists shroud the world at night, and a tyrant of a thousand years subjugates some people and controls others. Throw in a group of rebels who can burn metals to use magical powers, and we have our premise!<br /><br />One of the initial problems that I had with the book was that it loaded on the worldbuilding very quickly. In some books, things are fairly similar to the world we live in, and even then there's a detailed (but interesting) description of what makes the world special. In Mistborn, the reader is dropped in to the middle of everything. As such, I felt lost for the first few chapters since I didn't know what parts of the world were broken and what was just a fluke (was the ash just falling from the sky that day? What does it mean to burn a metal?), and I felt overwhelmed when I was learning about the magic (Sanderson talks about all of the magic in a short period of time).<br /><br />However, after the first few chapters, everything is fairly smooth. There is still more world building (special powers, special metals, different types of magic users and magic, why that magic comes, new cataclysms, new societies), but it is paced well since most of the characters are learning about these things over time as well.<br /><br />What makes the book, though, is not the world, but the characters. Each of the characters is passionate, but they're all passionate in different ways. Several characters want to liberate the proletariat in a bloody revolution that kills as many bourgeoisie as possible, but several people want a peaceful revolution. One character champions trust, whereas another is an untrusting recluse. One character is prone to philosophical musings, and another is a religious scholar.<br /><br />Let me focus in on the religion for a moment. The tyrant has quashed most of the world's religions, but their memories live on, and throughout the series, we learn about some new ones. Part of this revolves around the characters -- some are religious adherents, and some have a crisis of faith. This allows the books to explore questions of faith, of logic, and of why bad things happen to good people. Underlying all of that is a set of prophecies that led the tyrant to take power in the first place. Rather than presenting them as a fixed text, the books show many different perspectives on them and how they change over time and depending on who is reading them, providing a nice view of the subjectivity involved with many belief systems. It also made the religious mythology described in the novels more compelling. When I read Genesis, it feels very static and terse. The Mistborn series, on the other hand, is an engaging and dynamic account of why the world is how it is in the book's universe.<br /><br />The book's philosopher also asks a question about epistemology and ethics. He says, \\"God is the creator of all things, right? He is the force that dictates the laws of the universe, and is therefore the ultimate source of ethics. He is absolute morality.\\" He then goes on to ask if the tyrant, a god for most intents and purposes, could do evil (since he's a tyrant) or not (since he's the ultimate source of ethics). This is a question that I often wonder about progressive religious people. Many of them will overlook certain parts of the Bible (or other religious text) because it conflicts with their notion of morality (eg, condoning slavery or not supporting the rights of women). However, if that religious text is supposed to be the word of God, then what basis would a mere human have of disputing its ethics? If it isn't the word of God, then what basis would that person have identifying with that religion?<br /><br />The second and third books also contain contrasting descriptions ofan individual becoming a leader. One person becomes a leader by studying, practicing, and putting themselves into situations where they have to be a leader. Another becomes a leader through force of will and desperation. In both cases, leadership is more about accepting responsibility and trust and having confidence in one's own decisions than it is about any particular title.<br /><br />Underlying these discussions of leadership is a question of human autonomy. Some of the magic users in the book can use magic to manipulate people's emotions. One magic user asks, \\"is it really that much more 'powerful' than having a charismatic personality or a fine set of teeth?\\" We, as humans, like to regard ourselves as rational and think of external influences (eg, chemical substances that affect our emotions) as having a small effect, but pretty much every piece of social scientific research shows just how false that assumption is. Some big determiners of success and charisma are how tall you are and how deep your voice is. In addition, some people know just the right words to say to get what they want. That is incompatible with the notion of humans being purely rational. What does it mean, then, to manipulate someone?<br /><br />In addition to discussing autonomy in interpersonal situations, the book goes in to autonomy for a given individual. Every individual has multiple aspects to their personality -- which one is the \\"real\\" person? We often talk as if procrastination is a degenerate state of being and the real person is the rational, goal oriented one. We also often talk as if our public face is less real than our private one and like our \\"practical\\" and \\"moral\\" selves are different. I think that this notion of a divided self is harmful because it allows a person to gain psychological distance from their self, and psychological distancing lets people do unethical things. Throughout the three books, many of the characters go through some crisis of selves.<br /><br />The series also has an interesting discussion of politics, a few nice coming of age stories, and a few nice love stories. Overall, if you found some of the questions I raised interesting or if you just want a well written fantasy novel, check it out!an individual becoming a leader.

B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|Oh, lord have mercy now I am a criminal<br />Man Down<br />Tell the judge please gimme minimal<br />...Rihanna<br /><br />In a country where the justice system has swung like a pendulum from the Salem Witch Trials and Old West vigilantism to pleading down murders and other crimes to almost nothing for the sake of getting anything on the books, revenge movies have become a favorite guilty pleasure for many.  However, there are different kinds of revenge movies.  In fact one writer, Grady Harp, whose reviews I most often highly respect, makes mention that in the case of the movie, Dead Man Down,<br /><br />\\"The theme is not good guy versus bad guy because every character in the film is a bad guy/girl and once the audience tunes into that then the emphasis is on that elusive human reaction to trauma called revenge.\\"<br /><br />What?  No good guys?  This is a movie and movies relate to real life. Right? When the Twin Towers went down we wanted revenge.  Did that make us bad?  Our military went to war and most all of us were behind that action.  I'm just saying, when there is any kind of rational justification we, as human beings, tend to want retribution. However, we hope for reasonable resolution, in real life.  In movies, we want gruesome revenge and yet, still consider the protagonist righteous.<br /><br />Between the director of Dead Man Down, Niels Arden Oplev, and the actors, Collin Farrell and Noomi Rapace, the spirit and humanity of these vengeful characters were culled with insight and care.  Two youngish actors, both masters of the dark, far-off stare, make a connection across the ethereal space between two apartment buildings and the souls of their characters, as well as their histories, collide.  This is an artfully convoluted plot, making sense at each surprising turn.  Isabelle Huppert, as Rapace's mother, was diaphonously present, blithely beautiful and childlike.<br /><br />Terrence Howard, as evil incarnate, did not altogether satisfy.  While I didn't need to see an overacting madman, I would like to have seen him use those nice cold blue eyes to convey more danger.  Instead, it seemed as though he whined his anger and discontent more often than not.<br /><br />Dominic Cooper, a Brit, sporting a Bronx accent, was a surprise.  His character was paradoxical and he certainly did it justice.<br /><br />*SPOILER<br /><br />Right up until the very, very end, I was enjoying myself.  The soundtracks, the cinematography, the New York and surrounding area location, the acting and THEN...  Our two protags ran from a fiery mess where no police sirens are ever even remotely heard and, muddy, bloody and wet, they jump on a bus where immediately a beautiful, haunting love song plays. Unfortunately, for me at least, our lovebirds grab a pole and make out with one-another as not one person on that full bus looks on?  Wha???  Had to take one off for that! So cheesy!<br /><br />Just sayin...eed to see an overacting madman, I would like to have seen him use those nice cold blue eyes to convey more danger.

B009GED3HS|5.0|I had just finished all of Seasons 1 through 7 on Netflix and I didn't know what I was going to do to watch Season 8. It's not on Hulu or any other valid website, the DVD isn't released yet and probably won't be until the fall AFTER the new (and final) season starts. I couldn't bear to miss more and find a way to catch up later, so buying the instant video episodes on here was one of the best decisions I've made! Season 8 is hilarious, touching, and everything else good about this show. I highly recommend buying the instant vids if you need to find a quick way to watch Season 8!

Arrived early and the prop is nice looks and feels like a real phaser detail is excellent.<br /><br />This is one prop worthy of adding to one's collection.<br /><br />My and my best friend who i met at a Star Trek Convention in Dayton.  Both went to see this her twice me three times we both agree as far as trek films goes this is one of the best of the 12. We laughed cried and another friend of mine was getting so carried away with the fight scenes between Spock and Kahn. He kept saying \\"Hit him hit him again.\\"<br />Now that is when you know it is a good movie.<br /><br />I am going to see this one again for the fourth time.<br /><br />I think Gene Roddenberry would be happy.<br /><br />The phaser with the gift set is very nice feels real has heft and spinning barrel is cool.

B00C2U6G7C|5.0|First off I will say that this soundtrack is very good, phenomenal, and overall fantastic. Hans really did an amazing job constructing a soundtrack that is every but as unique as this Superman Reboot is. This soundtrack definitely does not have any iconic themes such as the Superman March and the Love Theme from Superman (AKA \\"Can You Read My Mind\\") nor does it try to create new themes that resonate for the audience as a memorable theme, and that's OK. This is a very different movie for a very different time than when the late great Chris Reeves donned the tights, and it really doesn't need to have a theme that is similar to what John Williams created. At least Zimmer didn't shoot for what John Ottman tried which was to play variations on the precious franchise themes and into opinion it was terrible. No one can or should try to copy John Williams, however it would be a titanic chore to come up with something that doesn't copy Mr. Williams and is something that moves the movie through the ebbs and flow of the action and Zimmer delivers in this instance. I am looking forward to the next movie in the franchise and can't wait to hear how Zimmer continues along this line. Well done and definitely recommend that you buy this version of the soundtrack for the extras which are excellent.

0307271080|2.0|I'm not sure what her editor was thinking in letting this thing get so long. It is a simple story of a Nigerian ex-pat and her high school love at home, but is filled with every pedantic repetition of every racial and gender trope you could imagine. I ended up just loathing the main character: did she enjoy anything? She would answer my question, \\"why are you here,\\" by saying I'm the sort of lefty hipster who \\"just doesn't get it,\\" but that \\"just\\" doesn't cut it--WHY? the character makes assertions that are sometimes perceptive but very often irritating. And there is no self-reflection, or evidence that the author herself did anything other than identify with the protagonist. Some of her blog posts are interesting, as are the Nigerian details, but by and large this novel could've been cut in half and been twice as effective. The negativity was just depressing--I tried 90% of the way through my Kindle, but ended up dropping it, because I just couldn't have cared less. Putting the effort in and then dropping it says a lot.
B0000549B0|5.0|Classic heart warming movie. If you're into old movies and need to smile and feel good about life this movie usually does it for me.

B00957T6X6|3.0|Great set of books.  Impossible to see maps that are included in each book, they are so small and too much trouble to enlarge to usable size.  If I did not watch the series, I would not be able to visualize scope of Martin's world and scope of actions. Characters have always been Martin's strong point.  If I had to do over, I would buy the hardback series.

B00CM9JKQM|2.0|Got to say first and foremost that I really like Todd as a singer and he seems like a really cool dude so my review is not based on the singer issue. Probably has more to do with the absence of long departed band member Chris. It is just that every Queensryche record since he left just feels a bit stale and this new one, even though is a step forward, is no exception.<br />The songs go by with nothing really out of the ordinary yet I must say this is a great production in terms of sound quality and studio work. Very different from that other Ryche band that seemed to have used an old four track to record their entire failure. It is a spirited first try with Todd and I see great potential here but they are not there just yet.. Hopefully after they settle their legal stuff they can close that chapter and concentrate on making great music!

Ewan McGregor being in the film is a plus as well.  &#34;Jack the Giant Slayer&#34; is mildly entertaining and has some elements, such as a giant with two heads, that go too far, but all in all, it is fun for me.
B007V65R54|5.0|As someone who works in risk management I fully appreciate the concepts put forward in this highly readable book by Nate Silver.  The concepts are simple, but very subtle - which is why most people, at best, commingle, but more frequently confuse noise for a signal.  Silver clearly illustrates differences between signal and noise, and provides numerous examples to illustrate the dangers of not understanding the difference between the two.  In particular his insistence on probabilities and not certain answers, and his bringing forth in a non-technical way the concepts arising from Baysian Analysis are worth the purchase price by themselves.  A very readable book and highly recommended.
B003D513TQ|4.0|A very nice portrayal of Victoria and Albert's courtship and early life together.  I learned a great deal.  Recommend it.
B0041D843M|5.0|The China study guides you the knowledge to take control and responsibility for your own health. The book is well written and easy reading. Some of the information is frightening.....more inconvenient truth. You are what you eat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|List of fun with a challenge. Puzzling and interesting. Great for kids. A little &nbsp;test of the memory. I would recommend this for anyone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It amazes me how every book in this trilogy was better then the previous. Th  final book is a slower read then the second but the ending ties everything together. Wish there was another...
B008220BLG|5.0|Once again, a movie with Nicholas Hoult - an appealing young actor.  The movie is a unique take on the zombie genre.  I love the premise that zombies can be redeemed and regain their humanity as their feelings of empathy and love return.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|Tried downloading it on my tablet and I still don't have it so not much to say!<br /><br />I just want to know if anyone is using it was it worth it?
B000NY12LO|5.0|I found this book similar to Defending Jacob in that the theme of adolescent murderers is found in both.  I especially enjoyed the psychological aspects of the book,i.e. the bullying concept:PTSD.  Some may find the theme disturbing, but,unfortunately, it is becoming all to common in our society, and bears further scurtiny either the fiction or non-fiction milieu.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I watched all 3 seasons on amazon and loved it! Can't wait for the new season to start in January

B00AZMFO6I|4.0|As an opera lover, the operatic excerpts included in this film are frustrating because they are cut without regard for the musical experience.  The movie is Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, and maybe he would make the operatic cuts differently if he had it to do over.<br /><br />Dame Maggie Smith is a living legend.  I could watch her in just about anything, but wish she had been given a better, less predictable script to work with here.  I love the inclusion in the cast of so many actual retired musicians.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Play it at Drs office and waiting rooms, great to pass the time!<br /><br />Indefinite entertainment!<br /><br />Glad to have added this app to my note 2
B0085HWZ9Y|4.0|Wasn't quite what I expected or rather what I hoped for...the live performance that was on the now long defunct RAVE satellite channel.  Still good and worth having if a Robert Plant fan.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Great, great movie.  I think it's among the best of the Bond movies made so far.  The plot was intriguing and Daniel Craig' acting was superb, furthermore, he's easy on the eyes.  Great movie.  I have recommended it and even made gifts of it to friends.

B00CISC2DA|5.0|A masterpiece! Album of the year. We've waited for a long time with little hope of another BoC album, yet here it is! Boards of Canada fans cannot be disappointed with this one. Meticulously detailed production.
0345529057|5.0|After losing the bid on a used set of the 4 Game of Thrones books on ebay for $50, I was astounded to find the same set available new for under $20. This is an unabridged copy. Only the covers are changed to reflect the characters as embodied by the actors from the HBO series. The author is amazing as a story teller and the seller was very quick to send the brand new unopened set of books. Cudos to both Amazon and George R. R. Martin!
0312430000|5.0|This book is really only about one idea, so I can't call it an 'amazing' book, but the idea is very important and Gawande presents a strong case for it, as well as guidance on how to implement it.  The idea, of course, is that we should be using checklists to help us whenever we face complex tasks where the stakes are substantial (eg, medicine, aviation, engineering, finance, etc.).  The book is a quick read and it's not difficult to summarize the key points:<br /><br />(1) In many fields, our main challenge isn't ignorance but rather complexity, and our inability to deal with complexity due to limitations in memory, attention, and discipline/thoroughness.<br /><br />(2) Specialization is a partial solution to the challenge of complexity, but specialists often can't 'connect the dots' effectively enough.<br /><br />(3) As compared to individuals working alone, diverse groups (including groups of specialists) are also a partial solution to the challenge of complexity, especially when people on the front lines have authority to make decisions and there's open communication and close coordination.  But groups still have their own ways of malfunctioning (eg, herd effects and deference to authority).<br /><br />(4) There's abundant evidence that *checklists* are a highly effective tool to help deal with complexity.<br /><br />(5) Checklists should be precise, clear, tested and refined based on practical real-world experience, and of a length appropriate for the length of time available to complete tasks (eg, short checklists for emergency situations requiring rapid response).  They should include only important things, but not things which no one would ever forget.<br /><br />(6) People tend to resist using checklists out of concern that it will take too much time, and make work boring and overly regimented.  But the reality is that completing checklists usually takes much less time than people expect, and checklists inherently can't and don't cover things which require much judgment.  Checklists are there to get the dumb but important stuff out of the way so that we can focus on the challenging stuff.<br /><br />Do you still need to read the book after reading the above list?  Maybe not, unless you're not convinced about the value of checklists.much judgment.  Checklists are there to get the dumb but important stuff out of the way so that we can focus on the challenging stuff.<br /><br />Do you still need to read the book after reading the above list?  Maybe not, unless you're not convinced about the value of checklists.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was not pleased with this book at all. The story did not go anywhere. A lot of cliff hangers
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Awesomeness, the kids absolutely love this game. Been playing it non stop for 2 days and counting. A must have.
1623420148|5.0|Nowadays, romances tend to be all the same; a hot, sexy CEO, a beautiful woman... you get the picture. And even though this book has all of those components, it's different than anything I've ever read. In Tangled, it's in the guy's perspective, but this amazing author  takes it a step further. You're not only in his head, it's like your own personal movie where he's talking directly to you. It's an amazing read and I would definitely reccommend it for anyone who loves a steamy romance with a sassy, funny love story!!
0345528581|5.0|This is a great book and very resourceful -- I suggest you look into the free app by the same author. However, it is a bible only in the sense that it's comprehensive in things related to very temporal stuff. Please read the real thing, the word of God, the Bible itself, for real wisdom and knowledge that will give you truly permanent guidance that will lead to eternal life and not a great body. What benefit is it if you gain the whole world (as in developing the best body i the universe, and yet lose your own soul -- really, think about it.
B00190KZUU|3.0|Interesting story but not amazing.  Had some good teaching moments for children along the way.  Made us think what we will leave our children.
B004J4XGN6|2.0|Very good concept but the author just repeats himself after the first few chapters. Should have just been an article in the Harvard Business Review.

B00DJFIMW6|1.0|exactly like subway surfers just more boring. took too long to load..too many details. movie in the beginning you have to watch..just an annoying game..go download subway surfers instead.
B000ID3KU6|2.0|Just as expected on an old western movie. Not much of talking, I can fallow the story fine  but There's no happy good ending. Left the widow alone and not sure if he turn back to stay with her. It's like an unfinished movie.
B003477DVK|4.0|A good story about friendship, great family entertainment. Skip was great, and the kid was terrific. Highly recommended for all ages.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Not much to say about angry birds that has not been written. Precisely, despite all that, I still like the game...
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great story line with mystery and connections to future seasons. Tons of twists and turns that will keep you guessing.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Beautiful movie. I especially loved the cinematography. The story was very original and emotional. It pulled your at your heart strings.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this movie.
0060191325|4.0|This book really helps you understand both yourself and your spouse better.  How you both think, what your needs are, how you see the world in different ways and relate to people differently.  The only thing is that he gets a bit carried away with giving too many examples to make his points so that gets a bit tiring after a while.  There is a lot of wisdom in this book that will help you in your marriage and life in general.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Only ten levels (for now) but more to come. Very creative games that match hidden object games with problem solving. My seven year old did better than I would have guessed, but we had a good time playing together talking through the clues.
B0093QE37S|5.0|that everybody should see at least once. Top of the tier cast and performances that give this film a long shelf-life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I found this game very intriguing. I completed all ten floors and look forward to the new floors yet to come.
B00D37UQ1K|2.0|The Host is a movie about aliens who threaten mankind by taking over human bodies and erasing their memories. Melanie fights for her body against an alien know as the wanderer.<br /><br />When I originally saw the trailer for this, I thought that this had an interesting concept for a plot line and if done the right way, would be great. I am not familiar with the original book on which this is based, so I don't know how far it is off there but that is not the problem with the movie.<br /><br />But after watching the movie to me, this seemed like a low budget version of Twilight or a movie idea that should have been a mini-series or a TV series idea that they decided to make as a movie. And although this may appeal to those fans of the Twilight series and those in that demographic, the talking in your head concept of alien takeover just didn't translate well to me on the big screen. It seemed a muddled mess that had long stretches of nothing going on except unbelievable behavior and romances by the characters. Sci-fi doesn't have to be all action but at least give me some type of action. 90 percent of the movie is set in a cave in the desert where amazingly the most exciting thing going on is the wheat being grown there. The acting and character interaction was almost as bad as the movie concept.<br /><br />If done a different way, this movie had a lot of promise, unfortunately the way they brought this to the big screen, just didn't translate to me. A shame too, as this could have been a great story.
0345529057|1.0|I read the first 2 no problem but in book 3 it skips from page 112 to page 177 do not order from these guys!!!
1781162646|4.0|I had never read Stephen King before because I don't read horror but the revies in my Sunday paper caused me to want to give this book a try.  I really enjoyed the read.

1401323820|4.0|If you watch the TV show Castle, this is so real, so full of the character's personalities and preferences, that it is truly like sitting through a feature film while reading.  Lite fare but satisfying.
B00CL68NOG|3.0|These two actors being the stars in this movie lead you up to believing this is going to be a hilarious movie - it wasn't.  It wasn't a terrible movie, but just disappointing in lacking the humor factor.
B005OTGS4E|2.0|I enjoyed most of the movie. It had everything you could as for and was very much akin to \\"Where Eagles Dare\\". Then as we reach the climax of the ending - nothing - it went nowhere. It the war movie I \\"almost enjoyed completely...almost!

B0062YADWI|1.0|This item sux! It doesn't feel great the size blows. It's cool that it haves a bottle opener. But who needs it now a says most everything is twist top n even if you get a regular top bottle to use this it's just not affective.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|a  very interesting story  it appears to be very  much science fiction but a possibility just the same  a very good movie
B008JGSM6G|4.0|great for when you just want to sit and do nothing.  but gets a bit repetitive but a good time filler
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I really liked this book. Typical Neil gaiman book. Not my favorite of his works as I tend to love more of the epic ones but this I'd a nice heartfelt story about a man and his childhood.

B001BIJNOE|5.0|Just like rock and roll animal, this is phenomenal. Great fluid keyboards, guitars, and of course vocals and lyrics. You can't go wrong. Everyone should have a copy of Viscous.
B000055Y0X|5.0|This movie is hilarious as it approaches its 50th year out. Peter sellers is hilarious in all three of his roles. There are definite kubrick touches in this movie, but none of the creepy ones. The DVD doesn't have much in the way of special features, but that wasn't some thing they did at the time, so I understand. Worth watching at least once, if only for the riding the bomb scene.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Great movie about the love and bonds of family.  A story about 4 daughters and mothers seen thru flashbacks and today.  Highly recommended!!!

B00DIFARQ6|4.0|It's a fun plane simulator for young and adults. It takes a while to get use to control the plane but when your use to it really gets you to keep playing. The graphic is pretty decent. So far I haven't had any problems with it. I really really recommend this game to everyone.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Really good !! Must play an  when you do you'll never stop and I think everyone should play this game. I like how it's an old war game
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I was so excited to start playing the game after I downloaded it. When I opened it, it started loading, when it was done loading it didn't open and it sent me back to my home screen. I tried over and over again to try and get it to work, and every time the same thing happened,it didn't work and it sent me back to my home screen. I wish it would have worked so that I could have atleast gotten one chance to play it, but I ended up not getting to play it at all.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Harry Potter box set- what's more perfect? Everything was included, there was the hard case and a slip. Loved it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|This is Streisand at her best, performing several not-very-often heard songs, which in themselves are masterpieces in their own way.  &#34;Being Good Isn't Good Enough&#34; is one of my favorites, as are many of the other sensitive and nostalgic renditions sung only as this uniquely gifted artist can.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|What a fun show!  SG-1 was great, Atlantis was great, Universe kind of sucked.  I think there would be a market for more like this movie.  I know I would watch.

0062059963|4.0|Originally posted at Cloud 9 Shelf.<br />([...]<br /><br />Rating (Scaled 1-5): 3.5<br /><br />Why I'm Reading It: I'm not sure why, honestly. The first book  and the mid-quel weren't too awesome or anything, but for whatever reason I feel compelled to continue reading about these characters and what is going to end up happening to America and Maxon (and kind of Aspen). Plus, we get a ridiculously gorgeous cover  (look left). I'm obsessed with this mirrors/dresses theme going on!<br /><br />Summary: (Mild spoilers for the end of Book One) After the dangerous rebel attacks that occurred in The Selection, Prince Maxon sent all but six of the contestants home. These six are a group of girls called \\"the Elite.\\" The Elite begin their princess-training while still competing for Prince Maxon's heart- and his crown.<br /><br />America remains conflicted between her emotional feelings for Maxon as well as Aspen, especially as the Selection becomes more competitive. She is determined to figure out who her heart belongs to, while discovering more about who she is.<br /><br />Review: The Elite has many improvements over its predecessor, The Selection. First and foremost, we actually met the antagonists during one of the rebel raids. The scene was brief, and I was left a bit confused as to what in the world was going on, but it still shows an attempt to bring the \\"dystopia\\" side of the novel to the front. This, of course, is where the novel needs more trying. I can't really tell you why it is a dystopia. However, the romance remains strong, and the main reason I stuck my nose into this book.<br /><br />The romance elements are strong and very, very there. However, as the main focus of the novel, I was sort of disappointed by America's flip-flops. I just wanted to scream at her, \\"Fickle Mer! Don't you see how awesome Maxon is?\\" every time she went back to Aspen. She remained pretty focused on Maxon in the novel, but she got pretty angry at both him and Aspen at various points. I'm just waiting for the day Maxon realizes that his favorite girl used to date her main guard... DRAMA.<br /><br />I'll also say I like how Maxon is finally taking control of his own life. As per The Prince, he normally lets his father do things for him and is walked over plenty. In The Selection, he sort of let America make the decisions in his relationship with her. But within the novel, Maxon begins to connect with the other girls and go on dates with them as well as America. She gets slightly upset over this, but I honestly think it is really good to see Maxon striking out on his own against his father and America and not being held down while he waits for others to make up their minds.<br /><br />There is some slight character development in other characters as well, including America. To emphasize it the author has America's father send her letters with her attributes spelled out for us. Shoving it down our throats is not the right way to go with that kind of thing. Yet we still get to finally understand some of the background characters, the queen being the first one who we haven't ever really seen. She is very calm and doesn't seem to exert much authority, but the little time we spend with her makes me enjoy her prescence in the novel.<br /><br />Another character who we saw some more of was May, America's little sister. I really liked her from the first novel, so seeing her and her sister together again was a lot of fun.  There was plenty of tension with Celeste, one of the main rival's for Maxon's heart. The interesting Frienemy-ship that developed between  Kriss and America also is something to look forward to, should you decide to read it.<br /><br />The most surprising moment came after their Halloween party when Marlee ran into some trouble. I won't reveal what happens, but it shows lots of improvement in the plot as far as actually affecting characters lives goes.<br /><br />Overall this novel should be taken for what it is: a nice, fluffy romance novel. It isn't the next Twilight or Harry Potter, but the plot is fun to read and the romance works for a YA. There are some mild improvements over the previous novel, and so it is worth reading to some extent. Happy reading!

159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini has done it again. In his latest release, And The Mountains Echoed, he has written a heart wrenching best seller that gives us a window into Afghanistan's culture and stirs the soul.<br /><br />Years ago I had a terrible nightmare wherein I had declined to marry my husband and we'd gone on to marry other people instead. Soon after the weddings, I realized with agony what a mistake I'd made and felt the full weight of despair as I understood I could never make it right; we could never be together now that we were committed to other people. It was such a deep and profound sense of agony and loss that I woke up from this terrible dream sobbing so loudly and in such a frenzy I literally made myself sick. This - this feeling of irreversible bitter pain and sadness that cannot be undone - this is what Khaled captures so perfectly in his stories.<br /><br />And The Mountains Echoed introduces us to two motherless siblings, Abdullah and Pari, and then subsequently tears them apart and keeps us pining for their reunion throughout the novel. We want the satisfaction of their reconciliation. We crave the happy ending that Khaled keeps just out of our reach and it's this longing that provides the pace for the novel. Along the way, we're pulled deeper into Pari's life after the separation and into the life of her uncle Nabi, her brother Abdullah, and a number of other key characters. Khaled has a lot to say about difficult families and about loss and he says it so beautifully with his prose:<br /><br />\\"All my life she gave me a shovel and said, 'Fill these holes inside of me',\\".<br />~Pari<br /><br />\\"They tell me I must wade into water, where I will soon drown. Before I march in, I leave this on the shore for you, I pray you find it sister so you will know what was in my heart as I went under\\"<br />~Abdullah, composing a note to his sister<br /><br />Khaled takes readers on an incredible emotional journey across continents and many decades as Pari, Nabi and the others live out their stories. I could not put this book down once I began. And The Mountains Echoed goes into the very special subset of books I have read that have moved me so deeply I weep for days after I close the cover.<br /><br />Buy this book. And a box of Kleenex.others live out their stories. I could not put this book down once I began.

B003UYV08E|5.0|To my way of thinking, this film was better than Iron Man.  It had a more entertaining story line to me and the action was also very good.  We got to know Tony Stark a little better in this one and I am looking forward to Iron Man III.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I didn't like the last two episodes.  Didn't end well, but the overall rating would have to be a 5 star review
B00CH26TL8|4.0|The colors are bright and the animation is really fun.<br />My kids love playing it it and like the witches.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Brilliantly written. The author stepped out of his comfort zone describing life in Afghanistan during the civil war and showed good knowledge of life in other cultures. Very touching stories... I can't wait to read Khaled's next novel
0714864803|5.0|I received a copy of Salma Hage's new cookbook, The Lebanese Kitchen a couple of weeks ago. The publisher, Phaidon, is well known for producing high quality books that are lovely not only to read but beautiful to hold and to look at and The Lebanese Kitchen is no exception. The pages are uniquely cut with a delicate zigzag edge and there are at least two colorful ribbons strings sewn into the binding for easy bookmarking.<br /><br />This is a heavy, large cookbook; an exhaustive encyclopedia of the best of Lebanese cooking. So many recipes to choose from in fact that I wasn't sure where to get started. Over the past few weeks I've made Hage's hummus with chili oil, eggplant and garlic dip, Lebanse mixed salad, and zucchini stuffed with lamb. Everything has been phenomenal and I'm really pleased to count The Lebanese Kitchen among my favorite cookbooks. The recipes are well written in that they are accurate (no typos or proportion errors) and easy to follow. Bonus: there are a number of full page photos sprinkled throughout the book that provide a visual guide to what the finished dishes should look like and that's very useful.<br /><br />It would be a welcome addition if the next printing provided notes such as background or history to accompany each recipe. When did the recipe find it's way into Lebanese cuisine? Which region of Lebanon gave birth to the flavor profile and ingredients? Was it inspired by another nation's or culture's cuisine? And so forth... However, the cookbook stands strong (recommendation: buy, buy buy this cookbook!) as-is, even without these requested details.
B001NAT05W|5.0|I love watching &#34;rags to riches&#34; movies, and this one portrays this theme well.  One can only stay quiet and meek for so long before the &#34;inner animal&#34; wants to come out and claim its turf...
B0068FYZCA|5.0|One of my favorite movies that I can watch over and over and would liked to have lived in a time to have seen these beautiful cars
B005SCSL56|5.0|This bok is one of the BEST books I've ever read! I wrote out all the wishing spell items, which kingdom, the ruler and which item.

B00ATDOVNK|3.0|&quot;Free&quot; is misleading. Graphics are amazing &amp; the game is challenging without being too hard, but it is only free to a point. Then you have to purchase to continue. If that weren't the case, I'd have given it 5 stars.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I haven't had time to read the complete book, but I like what I have read so far and it will keep me to work in time to continue to read it.
B004QL7K6G|4.0|I love Paul Rudd and I was surprised at the chemistry between him and Jennifer Anniston- who really came out of her usual role shell in this movie. Creative and fun. A little sophomoric at times but overall fun to watch!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was amazing. Between the mysterious past life of the main character Katie to the magical love between Katie and Alex. I absolutely loved this book.<br /><br />I watched the movie in the middle of reading this and I was a little disappointed with the movie and wasn't going to continue reading. Am I glad I did though!! The book is so much better than the movie with no comparison.<br /><br />Anyone who has read Nicholas Sparks knows he has a way with love stories and this is just a new incredible addition. For anyone who is new to Nicholas Sparks you will love this story and if you don't I will be shocked!<br /><br />Love love love
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|how in the heck does it work every time I tap on it it sends me to the main menu I like to play it on my friend's ipad but it won't work on my kindle
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Really fun to play.  Some of the tiles look similar but they are not so it really keeps your attention.  Addictive.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I really love to play this game. it's so awesome to play one of the best games I have ever played and its free!
B005JR47R6|4.0|House is on the books for me as one of the best TV dramas of our time.<br /><br />David Shore is a master at delving into the psyche of each character, telling stories of interesting patients *and guest stars and crazy illnesses, and trying out different points of view as the seasons' progressed.<br /><br />Season 8 was the only season that I don't give 5 stars to: Olivia Wilde, Dr. Cuddy, and Dr. Cameron are all off the show.  I feel like Cuddy was one of the characters that really kept the show alive. Olivia Wilde was an excellent addition. And Dr.Cameron although in and out of the later seasons, still was one of the original characters. So in Season 8 we are left with none of the original female characters which gave balance to the leading males of the show.<br /><br />I think the new Asian doctor is funny at times but the other one is nothing more than eye candy and lacks the intensity that Olivia Wilde brought to the show.<br /><br />I haven't finished the season yet- so I'm hoping that they bring some of these gals back for the season finale!<br /><br />Farewell House- What an amazing run!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't wait for more rooms! My 9 yr old son and I enjoyed playing this together. Not so challenging that you give up.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Was looking for a new game to play while my husband channel surfs.  This game is fun, quick and keeps you thinking,  Puzzles go from easy to challenging.  If you get stuck you have some hints, you can always buy more hints for a minimal charge.,  Fun.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I own a Nikon DSLR model D3100.  It has its own flash unit built in.  And it works fine.<br /><br />BUT.  When I added this unit, the SB-400 AF Speedlight Flash, it improved my indoor photo's and night time outdoor photo's  a whole lot.  The color's come out better, the flash unit is fast and since it is a bigger light, it cover's more area.<br /><br />I have captured some astonishing photo's at night.  Once I had my camera out at the ocean.  I live 1/2 block away.  I got home and a fully grown skunk was sitting 20 feet away.  I took 3 quick picture's and ran the other way.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. makes you really think and its not like any other game ive ever played. when I seen it I thought its probably boring but once I played it. it grabbed my attention. I finished the whole game in one night that's how interesting and fun it was
B008TRUDAS|5.0|It doesnt only teaches you to love, it teaches you to live life fully. Very good book. Cried for hours.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I have no idea why this movie got horrible ratings. It's actually quite good! Give it a chance and you'll love it, too.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|some trouble navigating, but mostly cause it is new and not used to it.  Found out this application collects much personal data.  It might be free and work well, but I refuse to give personal data.  I uninstalled it same day of install cause I found out too much info going out.
B00AEFYW64|1.0|This is the worst Amazon service provider I have dealt with and would NOT RECOMMEND anyone to use it.<br /><br />You sent me a DVD which did not play in the UK systems.  I returned it within the stated time period and did not get my money back or my return postage paid.  Every month I have emaied yu with attachments and you have said they are being filtered so you have not responded.<br /><br />This is the worst Amazon service provider I have dealt with and would NOT RECOMMEND anyone to use it.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|The game goes to the loading screen and then goes back to the main home screen! It works for my cousin who has a newer version of a kindle fire but not my older one!!!
B0050QV0RQ|3.0|A fun throw back title but lots of back tracking and lots of boring basically repeat battles. Not enough variation to make this game an A+ title.<br /><br />I would love this game with a bit more open endedness and a lot more variety of opponents. As it stands now I get bored but not enough to stop playing.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I had seen the movie in theatres, so I knew how excellent it was. Additionally, I'm a tremendous Bond fan. Loved this movie and quickly took it on vacation to enjoy.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The first movie I saw was star wars epsoide 4 a new hope when I was 2. My son is 4 and has not seen any of them. I found the saga at wal mart for $120. I found the same one on amazon used that said it was worn on the edges for $60. I ordered it. It came 3 days later and it was in MINT condition. I was thrilled. All 6 movies in blu ray plus 3 extra footage discs. Amazon is good to go in my book. Thanks a lot. My son loves them and so do I.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|works well for basic printing, but seems to ignore preferences such as 2 sided print. all in all I'm very pleased, and it doesn't come any cheaper than &#34;FREE&#34;
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved the history and how the characters interact. Would highly recommend it to anyone.  So glad something like this is available if you miss the original broadcasts.

B00BU18U82|5.0|I downloaded this game for my 7yr old son who loves John Deere tractors.  He really enjoys playing simulator games vs. pretend games.  He would play this the whole day if I would let him!!!  The only downside is you have to pay real money to get new tractors and plows and stuff.  They need to make it so you use your money you make from farming to upgrade your vehicles and implements.  That is the only downside to the game.  Great game for the $
B0034G4OY0|3.0|The intro scene is its redemption. Damon credible acting carries and pulls off an otherwise lame script. He is one of few actors that can carry a lame script.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was just as good as the movie was. I can't wait to read the rest in this series of books!!!
B00BGIBVP8|5.0|If your 40 or older, you will love this movie. It portrays the reality of being married with children in today's world. Things are not always what they seem to other people. This shows the same struggles that many of us are experiencing, yet has this wonderful way of finding the humor in these situations. My husband and I laughed so hard at some of the scenes. We really did enjoy, so much so in fact that we watched it again the next night. I don't think you will be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app! its almost just like subway surfers! just with like mini levels you have to pass or you die. **<br />  __
B008IGAITQ|5.0|I had not seen this movie in 30 years.  It's still great.  The characters are the same with different actors playing the roles from the TV show.  It is close to the book as I remember it.  At the end of the day, war is still bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Nice graphics - works like a charm.  Very pleased. Not much more I can say about it. Easy download and install
B00DGN51O8|4.0|There are some scary parts for little kids but by today's standard this movie was pretty tame. Very enjoyable, good story, good acting.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|The action pieces were well orchestrated, and (as the DH franchies moves forward) ever more so implausible. But, it's escapism filmmaking and that's what you expect. The MAJOR downside to the film was the complete under utilization of John McClane. Seriously. Bruce Willis IS Die Hard and he was relegated to some supporting role in this film where all he says is &#34;But we're family&#34; &#34;You're my son&#34; &#34;Spys are stupid&#34; &#34;Let's kill bad guys&#34; and &#34;I am on vacation&#34; or some itteration of all those lines. That's it. Definitely a let down from Live Free or Die Hard.
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I watched Season 3 just long enough to mash the &#34;back&#34; button on my remote after seeing how drastically the cinematography went downhill. I don't know if they have a different director of photography, or just decided to shoot the next season on smartphones, but something happened, and the production quality took a turn for the &#34;soap-opera&#34;. Seasons 1 and 2 were ok and watchable because the photography was not distractingly bad. The plot of this show is not so engaging that I will sit through subpar production. I enjoyed seasons 1 and 2 quite well. Season 3 does not exist as far as I'm concerned. Quite a shame.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|ik its a great game cuz I got it on my dads phone but it wont let me play the game on my kindle fire
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Fantastic show.  Hard not to watch every episode in one sitting.  Characters are fully developed and the plot is not easily foreseen.  Can't wait for Season 4.
0060557818|3.0|(I struggled with selecting 3 or 4 stars, let's say 3.5)<br /><br />About halfway into reading this book, I found out that it is actually a novelization of a television series that Neil Gaiman was writing for the BBC.  I was kind of relieved because it explained a lot of the things that felt off about the reading experience.  Neverwhere is an immersive book. It moves at a pretty brisk pace with very few moments of a sense of lagging.  It shares that nimble velocity with popular universally appealing books like the Hunger Games and Harry Potter (I mean this strictly in terms of it moving along quickly and it's hard to get bored by). The story is reminiscent of Alice in Wonderland or Wizard of Oz in that it involves a central character who goes down the rabbit hole and meets all kinds of wacky characters, some more likeable than others, and sees some truly otherworldly sights with his ultimate goal being to return home again. It's a rock-solid foundation for a story. The sights are all particular to London, and there are many references to London's public transportation system, museums, districts, and other landmarks.  I was able to get a few laughs out of some of the referential humor (the protagonist Richard meets the actual Earl of Earls Court and wonders to himself what's at bizarro-London's Ravenscourt) however I think you will understand and enjoy the jokes more if you've actually spent in London that might go over the heads of others.<br /><br />I hope I've sold the fact that this book is fun to read.  However, I never really felt like I ever really connected with the main character or any of the others. It was kind of a bummer, because I would have liked to have gotten to know Richard better.  There is a brief mention in the beginning that Richard lost both his parents when he was young and had to be relatively self reliant growing up.  It was never brought up or alluded to again.  This is where the whole \\"it's really a TV series\\" thing comes in.  A the expense of a fun, action-oriented, ride of a book, introspection is sacrificed.  The author will say things like \\"Richard felt a stabbing pain in his lower leg and was becoming unbearable\\" but the author never strays on any tangent whatsoever to try to establish a mood or idea (this might actually be a good thing for some readers). It's very much a \\"this happens, then A says x and B says y and then THIS happens\\" feel. I'm not sure if I'm expressing myself well when I say that pace felt mechanical in that it just lists a bunch of stuff that happens. Also, I think it's supposed to be a children's or young adult's novel so my complaining about it's lack of depth is probably foolish.<br /><br />Another reviewer gave this 1 star and said it's pointless because there are no rules. Predictably, other browsers almost unanimously found his review to be unhelpful. I agree in that it wasn't very helpful to just make that statement and not explain, but there is an element of truth to it. It so fantastical that there might be some moments when you roll your eyes a little bit (see: deus ex machina).  It's sometimes tough to go along with just because physics don't matter in the least; a curtain on street corner can lead to a brick wall one moment then the next it leads to Atlantis(note: this is not a spoiler, Atlantis isn't actually involved..or is it?.. no it's not).  It makes for good escapism but not very engaging as the author never finds it necessary to explain how any fantasy elements actually work.  In fact, the people of London Below often revel in withholding explanations from Richard (and ultimately the reader).<br /><br />This book is a fun hallucinatory trip, and if you're looking for a fantastical romp where you don't have to think too hard then this book is awesome. I don't mean to sound condescending, because there is legitimate value books like this.

B001AQO3QA|4.0|The blu-ray bundle was great to watch and it had the directors cuts that came out years after the orig. Release.
B00A861QMM|2.0|Story was really lame, got fed up with constant back and forth. Scenes were very hard to search hidden objects some far too small to see even with the screen expanded.

B008B1BL4E|5.0|With no particular axe to grind other than to discredit facile and simplistic theories about the &#34;causes&#34; of World War I, this exceptionally thoughtful and penetrating history explains things I have never seen explained before in a publication for general readership. Because the various national &#34;threads&#34; of pre-war history in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century can, despite careful and patient exposition, the author thankfully does not hesitate to remind the reader of comments made and developments explained in earlier chapters. While the author does not hesitate to describe the idiosyncrasies and biases of individual actors,  the influence of and the effort expended on influencing public opinion, and the factionalization at times of a national society, or of a national government, or even of a department of a national government, he never falls into the fallacies that &#34;the man makes history&#34; or that &#34;history makes the man.&#34; Neither does he ignore the fact that good people can behave basely at times while bad people can behave nobly at times. I wish more history was written this well.

B008KYOCA2|4.0|As far as calendars go, I'd rate this as one of the best. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that the many features tend to over-complicate the environment, but to be honest, it's probably me. Bottom line... this is an excellent application and you can't beat the price.
B00821OX98|1.0|Watched the first episode. Was not impressed. Acting was stilted. There just wasn't enough there to want me to watch; however, to give the show a chance I started watching the second episode. Half way through I turned it off. Not going to waste any more time on this show. Too many other good shows out there to watch.
B006RXQ2CY|5.0|The movie gives a believable glimpse behind the curtain of royal life and both the insular view the royals held of the world's regard for Diana, and the Queen's ability to be educated and guided by her very young prime minister.

0385341679|5.0|The whole fever series is my favorite set of paranormal romance books. I never read a book more than once, but this series I read twice and would have no problem reading them again. I love Mac and Barrons relationship and how it weaves in with the fantastic story telling. I couldn't put the book down and it will forever be at the top of my go to for a great read. If you love Paranormal Romance's this whole series might interest you. Each book that came out just got better and better. I hung on every word and ever sentence and didn't feel the need to skim through like I have with some books. Would Recommend to anyone!
B005J4TLO8|3.0|Not all that impressed. It's okay, but not hilarious. I was disappointed, but had purchased it to get the free movie tickets for This Is The End, which, btw, was hysterical and very entertaining.

B004X4R49Y|4.0|Colin Firth does a great job of depicting the king's struggles with one of the most difficult idiosyncrasies to imitate, a stutter, which can so easily become a caricature.

B00CL68QVQ|4.0|The movie was surprisingly good!  My husband and I weren't sure what to expect even with all of the good reviews.  The storyline looked a little suspect to us. But honestly we were pleasantly surprised!  Check it out! Great movie!!

B007MDB71O|5.0|Wish this movie got more publicity . It is a pity that lack of funding can make a Great movie fail. This movie is awesome and  keeps you riveted to what will happen next., and is a great tribute to the series of books written by Edgar Rice Burrows. This movie literally brings his books to life and leaves you wanting more. I hope that they can finally take a second glance at this movie and  make a sequel. Then ADVERTISE it and people will go to see what all the hype is about !<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone!<br />The service was great, fast shipping and in great original condition.<br /><br />Thank you so much for having this movie available.
159463176X|5.0|Hosseini has kept us waiting for 6 years for another of his masterpieces and though the wait was long, it was worth it.  He does not disappoint with his newest novel...really more a work of great literature.  If you read his other books, THE KITE RUNNER and A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS, this book will rank right up at the top with the other two.  If you are new to his writing, this book will cause you to put all your other books aside so you can read his others.  He truly is a master at storytelling.<br /><br />This book includes stories upon stories.  Starting with a fable and then telling the stories of families over many generations and then by the end intertwining all of the individual stories into one.  This is how the title of the book is worked in.  I expected to find the title actually in the story, but the title actually explains the book. As you travel through each of the individual stories, parts of them \\"echo\\" into the next.  At least, that is how I interpreted the title.  That is what makes this book so uniquely beautiful.<br /><br />When talking with a friend about this book, I described it as heartbreaking and yet, wonderful.  Each of the stories were full of agony, despair, disappointment, suffering, or heartache, but they were also full of hope, happiness, and surrounded by a love and devotion for family.  That devotion is what kept you turning the pages.  The love of family is really what is at the heart of this novel.  Brothers and sisters, cousins, and even friends who are all the family that the person has.  The decisions, compromises and judgments rendered in each of their lives and the ramifications for future generations were mind-boggling.  How Hosseini can create these stories is amazing and I am so glad he has shared his talent with us.<br /><br />The stories are set in Afghanistan, Greece, France, and the US.  There are stories of extreme wealth and severe poverty.  The stories of poverty, especially in Afghanistan, were such a jolt to my easy life here in America.  It was another humbling reminder (after going through a weekend of a \\"boil order\\" in our town) that there is truly so much suffering in the world that most of us have no grasp of.  I truly am appreciating our community and our freedoms after reading this novel.<br /><br />I could gush on and on about this novel, but I just don't want to give any more of it away.  The main tip I would give you for this novel is to try to read it in a short period of time.  I don't think that will be an issue because you will want to continue reading it.  But, even after just a 2 day break from the book, it was difficult for me to keep all the stories and characters straightened out.  The flow of the novel was a bit difficult at times because the flow of one story would stop and transfer to another story without much warning.  There were several times in the novel where I had to stop and reread a page or two to get my mind on the right people.  Keeping a character list might be helpful as you read along.<br /><br />This was our book club choice for the month and it makes for an excellent discussion.  The questions supplied on the publisher's website, although deep, were a good jump start to the numerous topics.  Loss, separation, family, and forgiveness are just a few of the topics you could start with.<br /><br />There were so many wonderful descriptions and ways to tell a story in this book.  I could have practically highlighted something on every single page.  I will give you just one example that when I read it, I nodded and said, \\"Exactly!\\".<br /><br />\\"It was a hot day, the sun biting the skin like it had teeth.\\"  Page 301<br /><br />If you like books full of description, emotion, and are character driven, run and pick up this latest book by Hosseini at your local bookstore or library.

The main tip I would give you for this novel is to try to read it in a short period of time.  I don't think that will be an issue because you will want to continue reading it.  But, even after just a 2 day break from the book, it was difficult for me to keep all the stories and characters straightened out.  The flow of the novel was a bit difficult at times because the flow of one story would stop and transfer to another story without much warning.  There were several times in the novel where I had to stop and reread a page or two to get my mind on the right people.  Keeping a character list might be helpful as you read along.<br /><br />This was our book club choice for the month and it makes for an excellent discussion.  The questions supplied on the publisher's website, although deep, were a good jump start to the numerous topics.  Loss, separation, family, and forgiveness are just a few of the topics you could start with.<br /><br />There were so many wonderful descriptions and ways to tell a story in this book.  I could have practically highlighted something on every single page.  I will give you just one example that when I read it, I nodded and said, \\"Exactly!\\".<br /><br />\\"It was a hot day, the sun biting the skin like it had teeth.\\"  Page 301<br /><br />If you like books full of description, emotion, and are character driven, run and pick up this latest book by Hosseini at your local bookstore or library. You won't be able to forget it.

B000P407K4|5.0|The brilliance of this film lies in its weaving together the contradictions of horror and humor, hubris and nemesis, insanity and sublimity.  The caricatures are crudely drawn yet pitch perfect.  The combatants are brave, patriotic, endearing - supremely human - yet ill fated.  The politicians and military brass are posturing, petty, buffoons, who though not necessarily evil, are unable to prevent great evil.  The special effects are deliberately low budget but like a good book are triggers for the imagination and not attempts to substitute for it.  The whole is seamlessly cut and with its hyper intelligent yet corny script never fails to amuse and amaze.  The possibility of all out, total nuclear war that hung over our heads during the cold war has receded but that has been replaced by the appalling and equally irrational prospect of atomic terrorism.  Doomsday has not been abolished nor has Murphy's law been repealed.  The harder we squeeze to try and keep things under control the more the unintended consequences tend to dominate.  There's a reason why this film tops almost every list of best films.  It resonates with our psyches and experiences on so many levels yet we know deep down that we will never really learn from our mistakes while still clinging to absurd, whimsical hope when, as King Herod complains in W. H Auden's 'For the Time Being', &#34;the general, the statesman, and the philosopher have become the butt of every farce and satire.&#34;
B0085YOD1A|5.0|I really liked this app it works as a great reminder so that you know when you need to start charging it. As the battery depletes there is sound notifications. And if you have a hard time seeing the battery icon on the top of your kindle Battery Pro is big enough to see that way you don't hurt your eyesight ^_^
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Beautiful cinematography!  Excellent script and fine acting made this movie so enjoyable. Loved the humor!  Fine addition to any movie collection.

B004ELSDZK|3.0|This is a great app to keep you entertained on long road trips or what nots. However, it kept freezing and crashing after a while of gameplay. Also, I don't know if it is just me, but the voice of the thing and the music is obnoxious. Maybe I'm just being nit-picky but overall, I thought it was okay.

B005NFJAZS|5.0|It was well packaged and arrived in good condition. The shipping was fast. The movie works well. My Daughter wanted to show this to my Grandchildren because She liked the movie. Many of the old movies are much better than many of today's movies.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A great book... Extremely well written and intriguing! A lot of great perspectives and scenarios..<br />A must read for twd fans during the break!!
B0016GOM5Q|5.0|My whole family loves the movie Tombstone.  It is a classic.  The little extra that came our way was that Michael Biehn, the star  actor that portrayed &#34;Johnny Ringo&#34; in the movie was in town shooting another film.  Me and some of my staff were privileged to assist (In a very small way) with the new production.  Meeting Mr. Biehn was very nice.  He is a nice guy and so is his wife (Jennifer Blanc).  The movie is great and getting a signed copy by Johnny Ringo, just made it a little more special to watch these days.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|A good treatise on the damage done in the Foster Care program.  Good characters and character development.  My only problem was with Grant; he was a little too Prince Charming for my taste.  A book well worth reading!
B000YEU1EW|5.0|I was one of the 40 people to see this movie during the 6 or 7 days it ran in theaters.  Its really a shame this fantastic movie didn't do better than it did.  I get so tired of seeing CGI special effects that are simply there to be the easy, lazy way to do something.  Car chases were just fine before they started rendering computer simulations of the cars in slow motion swivel shots so we can be taken \\"inside the moment\\" instead of just seeing the visceral action that an ACTUAL car taking an ACTUAL jump provides.  Or how about making big blue CGI Indians and weird alien horses instead of just putting actors in costumes so everyone can actually see how freaking stupid the \\"no, its totally an original alien race\\" Sioux Tribe of Avatar really was?<br /><br />I digress...<br /><br />I love movies but I get tired of my action flicks and sci fi epics turning into big cartoons at the climax of any given film because its time for the CGI fest to begin.  We all know its computers, we all know its not real.<br /><br />Then \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" comes along and shows us what the potential of CGI actually IS.  It uses state of the art (circa 2004, but it still holds up very well) computer graphics to create a STYLE and MOOD.  This film is a throwback to the sci-fi flicks and cliffhanger serials of the 40's and 50's and uses nothing but green screens to give us a highly stylized, absolutely *gorgeous* world that truly is a breathtaking work of art.  No, it doesn't look real.  Its not *supposed* to, and that's the beauty of it.  Its all done so well that you very quickly get sucked in to the movie itself, the non-stop use of green screens and CGI backgrounds quickly melt into the background and don't distract the viewer at all.  There's artistic passion in every frame and the movie looks so good because the people that made it obviously cared so much.<br /><br />If this were all this film was, it would still be quite an achievement (as a point of contrast, think back to the terrible green screen backgrounds of the Star Wars prequels and you'll see that such a feat is NOT easy to pull off successfully) but thankfully the movie is great fun for us movie geeks.  Looking back over the past 9 years of all the movies that have come after \\"Sky Captain\\" its kinda easy to see why this film didn't exactly break any box office records, but if you're a person who loves the gee-whiz movie magic of classic cinema, the time when the line between good and evil wasn't so blurred, when films weren't so cynical and gritty, you'll LOVE \\"Sky Captain.\\"<br /><br />This is a movie that is warm, fun, funny, and exciting and it truly does capture the movie magic of yesteryear, a high achievement again given its digital construction and for the fact that there is not a drop of irony or camp in the entire movie.  Everyone plays their roles straight and the movie is so much better for it.<br /><br />So if you want to see a movie unlike anything made in the last 15 years, give \\"Sky Captain\\" an honest chance.  With the exception of [[ASIN:B001CD6FKI Speed Racer]] (another great film that didn't find the audience it should have in theaters) I can't think of another live action movie that bothered to use CGI for style, not realism.  If you're tired of the same old stuff, watch \\"Sky Captain\\" you'll be happy you did.k back to the terrible green screen backgrounds of the Star Wars prequels and you'll see that such a feat is NOT easy to pull off successfully) but thankfully the movie is great fun for us movie geeks.

1609613937|5.0|Great book.  Lots of info in a short read as lots of space is dedicated to recipes.  This book makes sense and I use it along with Dr. Furhman's Eat to Live as a great companion.  You will see where they line up and where they differ and will benefit healthwise from both.  I recommend the starch solution for anyone that has been told that starch is bad.  It clearly isn't.  What's bad is what you had for breakfast lunch and dinner today...and what you will probably eat tomorrow as well.  That is what is bad.  This book will tell you why you.  This book will explain why you can change some things and live healthier.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|I own the hardcover (two volumes in one) Annotated Sherlock Holmes, so I don't really need another Complete Holmes, but I ordered this book for my Kindle.  The &#34;Terror and Mystery&#34; section is a surprise:  it includes stories that I haven't found in other Conan Doyle collections.  This is a wonderful bargain in Kindle format for anyone who doesn't have an extensive Conan Doyle library--and for anyone who does.  I intend to spend Halloween waiting on the little ghouls to ring the doorbell and reading Tales of Terror and Mystery.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love love love this book. I need my own Christian Grey!!!Wish there were many many more in the series &#60;3
B0063IH60K|5.0|Really easy to see cards and change designs. Excellent app. And free is best price. Goldwater pass the time airports and on the train.
B002TZS5GU|5.0|If you are in the market for a post-apocalyptic movie with substance, watch Carriers. This movie not only has plague victims galore, but it also explores the lengths people are willing to go in order to survive.
0061438294|5.0|This book is very helpful in reading people's body language and will help you keep yours in tact when you don't want the truth getting out. True story...had the book on a counter...a corrections officer brought a prisoner in for medical diagnostic testing.  He saw book and asked about it.  I then gave him an example of what's in the book by breaking down his stance, where he was placing his hands etc.  He was shocked at my reading basically his thoughts and feelings.  He looked almost immediately as though he felt like he was standing there naked.  I mentioned some behaviors that he may see on the prison yard and he readily agreed he saw those types of things all the time.  If he indeed gets himself a copy of the book he will more readily understand what those prison body's are saying more thoroughly then he had in the past.  I highly recommend this book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book. Holds your interest and the ending is unexpected. Worth time to read. Love all of his books. Thanks
B007L24T52|4.0|Balsamic once again surpasses himself by drawing the reader in to a complex web of receipt. I wish I could write as well as I read his books
B00AB7HESI|4.0|This is a REALLY cool game.I just love that there's so many choices as to what YOU want to do.No drop down lists,no multiple choice,just YOUR CREATIVITY. Awesome! I enjoy the playground feature you are even MORE unlimited. However,the reason I rate this only four stars,is that you only get to play the first 6 worlds without paying again.seems like something to expect from a free game (im sure it's happened to all of us...&quot;Unlock more levels for only 0.99!&quot; In one game or another.) But a paid app...I was very disappointed in that. But overall,I'm glad I bought it.At least I still have my playground! :D
B005LAIIPS|5.0|The Bourne Legacy is a great transition from the original Jason Bourne trilogy to the present. It's action-packed, has a great plot, and is well acted. You won't regret buying this movie.
0439023491|4.0|The second volume of the Hunger Games trilogy isn't as good as the first but is still a solid read.  While the first book kept me on the edge with intrigue and tension the second didn't do that until the last third of the book.  The first half reminded me of a true YA book which talked about romance and friendships which furthered the story and its background but I didn't find all that engaging.  Thankfully it picked up and the second part really pulled it back.  On to book number 3!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app! My 9 year old uses it also, so it's easy to use. Able to carry my sword every were I go. Love it!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I am an avid fan of games like this. A thought invoking, challenging, and addicting game that causes the gamer to ask where's the next level.  I could play this game all day with ease.
B003U6BE8I|2.0|Kind of cheap and cheesy.  Now my family associates the book with the characters in the movie.  I would not recommend.
B0064J6OMO|2.0|This movie had potential but with the raunchy sex scenes, it really took away from the movie IMO.  They could have left all of the raunchy parts out and it would have been a much better family movie.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed, a real page turner. Read through this book in just hours. Would read more books from this author.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is fun and awesome I recommend this game to any one the vector battle is hard and you will get to town and it will Mindanao be like subway suf but yeah I LOVE this game
B0046B1KHG|5.0|Everyone loved this movie!  Giggles and laughs abound throughout the house even though all had seen the movie in Theatres when it was first released.
B000W178XO|5.0|Most of Johnny Cash's classic songs. Brings back great memories.  Whats not to like and the price is great as well.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|This movie wasn't what I thought it would be and wasted my money.  Only watched about 15 minutes of it hoping it would get better but it didn't.
B00BFBSV72|3.0|It's great for keeping my 3 year old occupied when I need him to be, but not very thought provoking.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is captivating and suspenseful. I blew through it and was ready for the next in the series. The book is easy to read and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The undertones of government control liken to modern day society as well.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|Ordered for an iPhone 5 but was sent one for an iPhone 4.  Replacement isn't an available option, so now I have to pack it up and drive to the the UPS store and mail it back.  Then I get to wait for them to refund my money.  I would have been ok with the mistake if they had provided an option of sending me the correct product with a return envelope for the wrong one.
B00136JS12|5.0|A great album full of Boston's classic songs. Brings back great memories.  Whats not to like and the price is great as well.
B006G2124E|5.0|Great mix of thoughtful story line and humor. The movie is very true to the book, which I also loved. I've watched it over and over.
B0037NVM1I|5.0|The movie is one of the best of all time, easy to stream on Prime, and quality was great. Thank you
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft, a game to create worlds, battle mobs, gather resources, and just let your imagination run free. Absolutely BRILLIANT!!! This game is so addictive and fun. This game is so worth the money and if you want something to have fun with, this is the game. Get it today!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great show.  I have seen all of the shows and now I Can't wait for the next season to start.

B00AW0KGYI|4.0|Breaking Dawn part 1, just like the book, was great!<br />I bought this DVD to add to my Twilight Saga DVD collection (:<br />I recommend this product to you if you are a twilight fan.
B004FCEFUK|5.0|Honestly, having listened to this album multiple times since I bought it, there is so much to say, I think I could write a short novel about it. For one thing, if giving this album a 1,000,000-star rating was an option, I would give it that in a second. Calling this album a masterpiece is simply an understatement. As someone who is a fan of a wide variety of music, including all styles of classical (Beethoven, Mozart, Wagner, Vivaldi, Holst, etc), jazz (John Coltrane, Miles Davis, etc), classic rock (Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, The Who, Queen, Boston, Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Elvis Costello, etc), metal (Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Metallica, Slayer, Helloween, Gamma Ray, Dream Theater, etc), and so much more out there, I have to say that Seventh Wonder have achieved a level of progressive metal perfection that I cannot see being matched anytime soon.<br /><br />I did not even know about Seventh Wonder until I heard that Tommy Karevik was going to be the new vocalist for Kamelot, as Roy Khan's replacement. After that, I decided to look into them, and buy their entire discography. Now, after listening to all of them, and especially this one, I have absolutely no regrets at all. Tommy Karevik, is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the best melodic metal vocalists of this generation, sounding smooth and relaxed one minute and then belching out the high notes the next, proving that screamed vocals are NOT neccessary to overpower the surrounding instruments. The musicianship itself is top-notch at every level, especially with how the keyboards enhance the melodic flow of each and every song.<br /><br />The structure and tonality of the songs themselves is dominating on a level that holds the attention of the listener with every second that passes, even in the case of the 30-minute title track, which might as well be a full-length album by itself. Having heard big epics like \\"The Poet and The Pendulum\\" (Nightwish), \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" (Epica) \\"Heroes of The Waterfalls' Kingdom\\" (Rhapsody of Fire), \\"Elysium\\" (Stratovarius), \\"Mirror of Souls\\" (Theocracy), and \\"The Odyssey\\" (Symphony X), as well as some of the greatest jazz and classical masterpieces ever made (Beethoven's 9th Symphony comes to mind), I still never really thought a huge epic like \\"The Great Escape,\\" a piece of such great length and grandeur, was even possible! Seventh Wonder, needless to say, have proven me wrong! This is why I consider them as this generation's quintessential progressive metal band. End of story!<br /><br />Seriously, it is bands like Seventh Wonder, among others like them (see above), who are the modern-day big musicians. With their top-notch complexity and technicality, they possess musicianship and composition skills that set the bar for the standards of today's music. They prove that they take their influences from the great classics of the past very seriously, and more than hold their own in their own music, in terms of the level of artistry involved. Sadly, even though Seventh Wonder easily stand up to the classics in this respect, they are unlikely ever to see the same level of love and respect, but that will not ever stop them from doing what they love and do best, not ever caring about money, but rather for the ART.<br /><br />In short, if you are a fan of progressive metal and of GREAT MUSIC in general, I encourage you the BUY THIS ALBUM!!! You will not regret it in the least bit. You cannot go wrong. Seventh Wonder, along with many others that I have mentioned, prove that REAL, true, down-to-earth, honest music is not dead, but rather it is just hidden. Most of all, it is INFINITELY SUPERIOR to all that horrible, talentless pop-dance radio sound-alike garbage that is being slammed through our heads on a regular basis. I should not even have to say that, because that is just common sense. Anyways, just buy this album already!) \\"Heroes of The Waterfalls' Kingdom\\" (Rhapsody of Fire), \\"Elysium\\" (Stratovarius), \\"Mirror of Souls\\" (Theocracy), and \\"The Odyssey\\" (Symphony X), as well as some of the greatest jazz and classical masterpieces ever made (Beethoven's 9th Symphony comes to mind), I still never really thought a huge epic like \\"The Great Escape,\\" a piece of such great length and grandeur, was even possible!

B005HED11Y|5.0|If you love the new Star Trek movies of today, the I'd definitely recommend giving this series a watch. This is where it all started. I<br />Of course this show is really old and not as action packed like the movies today. But put that aside and get into the story. You'll appreciate that you did.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I love this cd/dvd.It is music that has something to say.I miss music that has something to say.All you hear from most popular music these days is just mindless crap.Neil Young wheather you love him or hate him he has to say.AND I LOVE HIM.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|This book consists of a series of journal entries, telegrams, memoranda and news articles, written by different people at different times. It's up to the reader to piece together all the events of the book based on all these scraps of information.<br /><br />The first couple of chapters were riveting, and I really thought the concept worked very well. I was even a little scared, and if I didn't know so much about vampires, and if the genre hadn't been re-interpreted so many ways since this book was published, I think I would've found it even more scary!<br /><br />The last few chapters, similarly, were action packed and fast paced, and I couldn't put the book down as it sped towards it's grisly conclusion.<br /><br />The rest of it? A bit disappointing. It's long-winded and difficult to read, and I found myself \\"zoning out\\" on more than a handful of occasions, and consequently losing the plot.<br /><br />For example, Professor Van Helsing is famous in the world of vampire lore, because of his role in Dracula, and I was therefore really looking forward to reading his character in this book. Don't get me wrong, he is an interesting, well-defined character with a lot of depth. But he can go on a bit, and he often has pages and pages of rambling monologue, which means that his real gems of wisdom sometimes get lost in all the ramblings.<br /><br />All in all, I would say that the book's reputation as a hallmark of the genre is well-deserved, and it's a pretty decent read. It's not particularly well written, though. Oh, and those chapters are long! It took me on average two reading sessions each to read each of them!

B00CO8D3G4|4.0|This book is a great read packed with some great advice. James does a great job at educating the reader using his own life experiences. Some parts are a bit dry but for the most part, great read.
B000U6BT40|5.0|What a great show! I am absolutely hooked! At first I though it had some similarity to Twin Peaks, the funky, mysterious characters, and probably the music too. But it is so much more! Much more enjoyable in fact. I can't wait to see where we're going with this! The show is a great escape, like a little staycation, but you don't have to check your intelligence at the door either. It is engaging and fun too! But each episode also is a nice neat little package, so you don't have to track much from one episode the next to understand what is going on. I highly advise people to check this out.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great trilogy of books! I only wish there was more. Even my daughter read through them all in under a week due to not being able to put them down.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This has to be THE  best movie biography of Abraham Lincoln ever made. Daniel Day-Lewis truly deserved the Oscar for his performance and Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jones are truly outstanding in their roles. In this movie we see Lincoln as a master politician instead of a mere folk hero icon. Kudos all around!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game realy funny minons easy to play wackey and realy really funnnnnnnnnnnnny so get the game before it isnt free
B00004RYZT|5.0|I wish they had more concerts out on dvd.  Rammstein is awesome!  The interviews on this DVD are really good and the show is amazing!  If you like Rammstein, you gotta have this one and Volkerball
0786955570|3.0|This comes with good models and board game pieces. The game play is not what I expected, the heroes in this have no ability to stop creatures from appearing and hammering you in the face every single round. You can still win but it's a lot of luck and very little tactic. Other dungeons and dragons board games have better heroes for diversity. The rogue in this game is the better wizard and the wizard is the better rogue. Get the legend of Drizzt or wrath of Ashardalon instead.<br />Unless you want a few cool models and a box with a sweet vampire on it.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Very cute movie. Not totally accurate on the hyacinth macaw info, but hey, it's a kids toon. What do we expect? Still a great, fun movie. Just don't let it lead to impulse buys on running out to buy a large parrot, or any bird without researching first.
B00BQ1DBUS|4.0|The songs were great, mostly heartfelt - but I must admit I love his older rock songs and the songbook series.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|A fun game the best ever<br />Love it so much get this apppp u will regret it if u don't get it
B008NC1LJ6|5.0|Very passionate and intriguing, takes place in many different countries so makes the world closer! You stay wondered until the very end of the movie.
0786958731|4.0|This appears to have the most features between the three dungeons and dragons board games. Unfortunately its about drizzt. Cool models and game pieces useful for things other than this game as well. The game itself seems a bit bland at least during earlier quests.
B009RH9FR6|4.0|hope the case works well it is tough.Not sure about how to flip it open or hold it upright.we shall see.
B004TUKNX6|5.0|How can you go wrong with a remastered classic?  This album has always been one of the greatest and now it sounds even better!
1469240580|5.0|Excellent story and characters.  The right amount of suspense, romance and violence.  I very much enjoyed this book and would recommend it to a fellow reader.  I've enjoyed everything I have read from Ken Follett - six of his books - you cant go wrong.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|Good insight continents Gladwell defines success as. I hoped he would define his method or opinion about how to become an outlier.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game!! for new people starting out: tap around the room. completing diff tasks helps u find other things that ultimitly lead to finding the keys and when ur done with the game rate it high so they can make more levels. good luck!!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|The moment I first heard him on Dave Letterman,  I knew I wanted more.  This, his and my first Rodriguez CD, is musical rawness splendor.  Can't play it enough.  It was about time for some real new music.  Ironic that it's old music and that this diamond was hidden in the proverbial haystack.  A MUST HEAR FOR ANY MUSIC LOVER.  Some classify it as anti-establishment or protest music.  I contest!  This guy is the consumate poet of modern human behavior in his times.  A WORK OF ART AND THE SECOND CD is even BETTER!!!!!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Kindle said I should get this, so I gave it a try cause it looked cute. It is a fun little game. Just got it but am happy. It's challenging to get the 3 stars per stage, so it has replay value.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|This is might be my favorite &#34;newer&#34; Tarantino movie. It's a tough call between this and Basterds. The cast rocks it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great show for the whole family.  Nice to have a show where my kids can sit and watch it with me.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|Years since I felt connected to any new music.  Thank God Sixto comes along and redeems my faith that there may be NEW music worth listening too.  Current artists might want to take a listen and take a lesson, from the real music on this CD.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton shows the grace and elegance of the period but also the rigors of the class system, the limits of medical treatment, and the fact that human nature, for the rich or for the working class, has not changed much over the years.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are sooo cute! Its fun but u need to make vector slower when we are fighting him... otherwise, its really fun! :)
B0037NVM1I|4.0|I've seen this movie a bunch of times.This director's cut has some deletes scenes which don't really add anything of value. I can see why they were deleted in the first place.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|THIS IS A AWSOME MOVIE A EYE OPENER FOR NEW PARENTS.... WE RELATED TO THIS MOVIE ALOT! LOVED IT!!!<br />NOT ONLY IS IT REALLY FUNNY BUT VERY TRUE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005N1OUSE|5.0|Direct, useful and focused book.<br />Great toolkit for everyday business problems.<br />It guides you on hoe to express ideas in a clear and straightforward way.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|great reading with a sense of humor and statistics/study to support the topics, as well as, an impressive list of people she has worked with throughout of career ... i've started reading it to my children!  MJ
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|love love loved it.  wish it were longer!!!!  can't wait for the next one...bring it on!  real soon! .... ....
B000I2JDEY|5.0|if you love drama, get this film. you wikll be unable to turn it off till its finished. Wonderful performances. Richard Burtan should have won an oscar. Everyone else in the cast did.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|In my opinion Avatar is one of the best movies made in years.  The technology and the truism of this film just totally enticed me to buy the Blu-ray version to enjoy whenever i want.  This is a movie i will watch over and over again thru the years.
B001NUO1HE|5.0|Could watch this many times. I love the scenes in the water, with all the fish. Amazing story and also keeps you on edge too.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|There are a lot of tricks and power ups. It is a little tricky but very fun. Hint: knock over minions and go through Fart Guns to get closer to the next level.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Small and handy. Had one earlier purchased from WM, but left it in a different place. Wanted to buy another, found it in Amazon. Good product.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved how the story was told not from some epic hero surrounded by 'good guy physics' but from the point of views of regular people. Each person's vastly different perspective gave a depth to the story only previously dreamed about by post apocalyptic fiction fans.
3832756302|5.0|Lovely. As described by this excellent publishing company so that I imagine any diaries or journals detailing a preferred artist would be a great addition to those pesky appointment and note keeping time management skills.
B00BWJ7LYG|5.0|I read the Tolkein series when I was a teen, about a hundred years ago, and I loved the books. When Lord of the Rings came out it was amazing...but it reminded me of why I didn't read the series more than once. It was just so &#34;dark&#34;.<br /><br />I didn't expect to enjoy The Hobbit as much as I did. It was put together so very well; perfect balance of ridiculousness and humour, edge-of-your-seat anticipation and a wonderful, heave-a-sigh-of-relief ending...especially knowing that the wee hobbit's adventures would be continued by Mr. Frodo and friends!<br /><br />My copy of the Lord of the Rings movies started collecting dust after I watched them the first time. I bought The Hobbit the day after I watched on Amazon instant video. I haven't actually put it away yet, after watching it 3 more times.<br /><br />A worthy movie to purchase and add to your video library.
B00BHMETKC|2.0|The movie is..OK...but that's it. Was pretty good, until they had to overly dramatize the middle through the ending; that's typical of Mr. Affleck, who is beyond unbelievable as an \\"agent\\"; ~ really? He should stick to the fluffy stuff he does pretty well, but a 'decent' attempt at directing. Certainly had 'renter's remorse' after sitting through it. Just sayin' ;)
B005HSL626|5.0|this one is better then the 99 cents version, so stick to this app and don't wast your money on the paid fruit ninja
B00CH26TL8|2.0|There wasn't enough information given on the  game and how to play for me to be able to enjoy it without becoming frustrated with it.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|I'm pretty 'old school' when it comes to traditions like Santa and the Easter bunny and I can tell you, these aren't the same ones I told all my kids about BUT, now that they're grown with kids of their own, they're certainly having fun with the concept!<br /><br />The idea of Tooth Fairies, Easter Bunny and Santa as 'Superheroes' is a pretty neat concept. And introducing stories about Sandman and Jack Frost, about whom so little is known anyway, really gives them personality. As an adult (a really old...OLD...adult), I appreciated this movie on many different levels, but most especially it gave me an excuse to still believe!<br /><br />In Rise of the Guardians, Santa is still jolly but he's seen to really be involved in INSURING the innocence and goodness in children, rather than just rewarding them by chance. It makes Santa seem more personal, to me.<br /><br />As for the Easter bunny, well, fluffy bunnies are cute, but to have a 'tough guy', Australian hopper who is in cahoots with Santa in keeping the &#34;child&#34; in childhood is pretty cool, too! I mean, I love Peter Cottontail to death, but as an adult I can appreciate this version!<br /><br />Sandman has always been a vague, benign sort of tradition. I like that this character is all cute and squoodgie...with a piece of iron at his core when provoked. The Tooth Fairy (and all her little 'Baby Teeth'!) make me wish I could put my false teeth under my pillow to see if I could fool them and catch a glimpse in the wee hours!!!  But Jack Frost...wow. There's a whole new story for us all. Or maybe that story is from a different cultural tradition, I don't know. What I do know is that when he caught up with his former life memories, I cried.<br /><br />All in all, I really loved this movie. I watched it with my two of my granddaughters, ages 4 and 2 1/2. They were spellbound! However, I think this movie is best left to the older children who are on the verge of losing those beliefs to impending adulthood. Not because little kids won't enjoy it, but as a little incentive to hang on to the dreams.ause little kids won't enjoy it, but as a little incentive to hang on to the dreams.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|I love this series! I started the first book not sure if I would like it, but the characters and story grabbed me and won't let go. I can't stop reading these books!
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Boz Scaggs's new album is terrific. He has a combination of old standards, as well as his new compsositions. Lovely album.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|I have been a One Republic fan since I first heard the song Tyrant on the short-lived vampire-detective show, Moonlight. Fast forward five years and two albums later to Native and I can only thank the music gods that Ryan Tedder and crew are still around. One Republic has always delivered emotional vocals, smart lyrics, and catchy choruses, and in this sense Native is no different...except that it is their most versatile album to date. From trendy pop songs to soul-infused rock it is not only an enjoyable listening experience, but it is music with heart.<br />For the month of July you can download Native on amazon mp3 for $5.00. So whether you're a longtime fan or new listener, just do it--do it now. You won't regret it!<br /><br />Stand out tracks: Counting Stars, Preacher,  Burning Bridges
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Today I opened this app and thought at first that my Kindle Fire HD had caught a virus.  Instead of showing me a clean, well-organized screen displaying useful information about the weather, I was presented with a screen asking me to sign up for some kind of social media game or marketing promotion involving accumulating points.  Once I bypassed that, I encountered various windows with navigation designed less for viewing the weather than for viewing banner ads.  With more clicks through this visual mess, I eventually found the weather forecast.  I then learned that this is not the result of a virus trashing my Kindle but of a Weather Channel revision of the interface.  It looks like the goal was to increase time users spend on the app so as to present more advertising to them.  Guess what? Advertising doesn't work when no one uses the app anymore.<br /><br />Despite the new mess of an interface, this app can still be used to find out about the weather, so it isn't completely useless.  But now I will probably be using a different app as my go-to weather one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is an incredible story that everyone should read. The lessons, different perspective and realization of what humanity is all about are amazing.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I hate this game on level 4 the flashlight  didn't work to see the keys that was in the box it was stupid
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show, and love the music. Was disappointed that a song was advertised as being on it but didn't make the cut. The &#34;refund&#34; of purchasing a download wasn't appealing to me so I didn't do that. Overall, the cd is awesome.
B00846REIS|2.0|Theres way too much sex and not enough story. Completely unrealistic even for a fiction novel. Main characters are annoying. If you want to read a porno this is it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much fun &amp; so very addictive for the whole family! After playing it on a smart phone, very happy to have it available on the Kindle with a bigger screen to make it easier to play!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The only problem I have is that I am waiting on more levels...I really enjoy this game...very different from others! :) Enjoy! Very simple but makes you think at the same time!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I installed the app on my kindle fire and as soon as I connected to face book it shut my kindle down. I restarted my kindle and it wouldn't let me back onto the game. I tried to reinstall it several times but it put a virus on my kindle and it wouldn't open at all.
B004XWLN20|4.0|2 damaged discs out of 62. Not bad, but it would have been nice to have been warned in the order description.
B005ZMUWWY|5.0|Our 4 & 6 year old girls are pretty sheltered from media and we found this movie totally acceptable.  Humans don't come out to well until the end, but the humor is appropriate and Eve's arm is the scariest thing in the movie.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love the minions. This app i was so excited for it to come out but when i downloaded it and tried to play, it wouldnt let me.  It just kept sending me to my home page. Im VERY upset. But i still &lt;3 minions!! :*<br /><br />9
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app... I have Minecraft on my Pc my kindle and my Ipod and my brother has it on the Ipad. If I had an xbox it would be on there to. Basically you chop,  shovel,  and mine your way through the cubed Earth to get rich materials and build your house out of them. There is so many things to build if your creative enough to think of them. Done with your house?  Use the rest of the materials to build a castle or a fortress. Anything to protect from the zombies,  skeletons,  spiders, and creepers along the way to the top. But don't worry, the monsters don't come off as scary at all. Build,  survive, create,  and have fun!
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I read it in two days because it was so good. I sat down to pee because I didn't want to stop reading. Just read it. Trust me.  It's amazing. On to the second book in the series.!
B009WUBERW|1.0|Nothing more than a money grab by actors who knew the script was horrible.  We turned it off after 10 minutes.  It is like a perpetual action scene where the audio and video are a 1/2 second off sync, making you sick every second.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|One of the best free game on the appstore, it s timekilling and fun. I would definetely recommend it to people that are not too sensitive.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|I love goodfellas  the move showed guys who want to be a part of the mod but there background didn't let them in to a family and they had to be full Italy
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|This is a tour de force on a good stereo with deep bass response.  Listen to this at volume or it loses its impact!  Having followed my own advice the other night, my wife came down to my stereo room to tell me that magnets were falling off the upstairs refrigerator!  WOW. Seriously, be careful if your speakers and amp are not up to the challenge.<br /><br /> The music fits the movie very well but also is enjoyable on its own.  Giacchino did a fine job of integrating classic Trek leitmotifs into the score.  I came back to this score often.
0062238868|5.0|Gave to my husband for Father's Day. It's the only book I've seen him read...ever. Kyle is a true hero.

B00821OX98|5.0|I liked this series so much, I stopped watching it for fear the network would cancel and they are notorious for doing. Really glad they did not so now I am catching up! Great SciFi with a good mix of drama and plot.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Nice way to waste some time. Graphics are good, like to be able to continue the game. blah blah blah
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Wow all these books are amazing! I know the movies won't make them justice. ... wish there was more. :)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My school has just went device friendly and when school comes back there will be no books and we will be using iPads for everything, but last year our team were the ones who got to be the guinea pigs with the iPads and one of the apps we used was evernote. I loved it so much I started using it for other things than school.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I travel a great deal for work and always want to know what the weather will be where I am going.  But I also use it regularly to check the forecast for home.  The weather in Kansas can change quickly and highs and lows from day to day might vary greatly.  Glad I don't have to wait to get home to watch the channel (or the news) or rely on the relatively old info in the newspaper.
B00APYKXFS|1.0|No instructions on how it works and pretty average graphics. Not hard to see why its not popular. oh well
B007UXSKMU|3.0|just trailer, boring, and i accidentally click it in and now i don't know why i rating this but still is ok.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The hunger games is a great trilogy. The final book was not as good as the first two in my mind but it was still great. Perhaps that is because the story comes to an end. Who knows?!? I would recommend it to all. I saw the first movie and then read the second two books. Incredible. Wish there was more...
B008Y79IUE|5.0|This movie gets really crazy, but I thought it was pretty good. The funny part is at the end durring the orgy thing that old man yells out &#34;ass to ass&#34; lol
B007SGM084|5.0|On  of my favorite book series I couldn't stop reading it and  I am upset that it has to come to an end. No doubt it worth reading it because you can even learn from it. I truly recommend it to people that likes love novelty mix with kinky experience.
B0058YPGL6|5.0|i love the action the thrill and the on the edge of your seat only thing i dislike is that it dosnt stay true to the 80's film franchise<br /><br />when i 1st saw this i was hooked the action and fantasy got me to stay<br /><br />loaded with on the edge of yer seat excitement and action for the men and shirt less abs 4 the ladies so something 4 everyone<br /><br />i relate this franchise to spider-man on the grounds that the main character struggles with his identity grimm and supernatural because its loaded to the brim with paranormal baddies and tons of kick butt action
B003YL4LYI|5.0|How could you do this to me Martin? I can't stop and am now desperately waiting another book. Have to read them all, but it's an interesting story and everyone dies.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This latest novel by Khaled Hosseini is a masterpiece of writing skill, language and voice.  This tale spans several decades of the 20th century, in which many characters' individual stories portray the Afghan diaspora, trying to come to terms with their destinies, some among other cultures of the world.  Some characters remain on the edge of Hindu Kush, watching the destruction and rebirth of their beloved Afghanistan.  Eventually, many characters, as well as their pasts, cross paths in farflung nations.  Some personas are outsiders but become forever endeared to their adopted, Afghan home.<br /><br />The storyline is created as a series of related short stories, depicting the main characters as extensions of the story theme. Within a few of the characters' lives, the reader can find some shred of truth about their own lives, thus making the reading poignant, relevant to its time and is as human as one could imagine or become.  And, as all the characters move through the plot, bits and pieces of themselves and their life experiences begin to float through the minds and lives of others, creating a vague sense of shared humanity and pasts.  Eventually, Mr. Khaled masterfully creates a conclusion that begins to resolve each characters' destined lives.  He helps them all find some fulfilling peace of mind, after years and years of wondering what was lost or what has been found. This is superb novel and this author's skills are evolving into that of a very important writer of the 21st century.<br /><br />Besides the literary skill of this tale, one has to appreciate the human voices that Mr. Khaled gives to today's myriad of cultural diaspora that are rapidly changing all of our lives.  With this story, the author succeeds in making all of us, as one, as we try to learn to recognize and appreciate those friends, colleagues and neighbors who are not originally of our culture but have arrived within our midst, hoping to assimilate and make a better life for their familiesand new communities.<br /><br />If you like this novel, by Mr. Hosseini, you must try his first stories: THE KITE RUNNER, the life tale of an Afghan boy who also finds himself, afar, in the Afghan diaspora.  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS depicts the life of an Afghan girl, as she matures into womanhood, under the rule of Taliban and the conflicts of her changing culture.<br /><br />For older children, some important tales about modern Afghanistan are in Deborah Ellis' THE BREADWINNER; PARVANA'S JOURNEY; and MUD CITY tell the tales of orphaned, Afghan girls, during their flight from the recent wars in Afghanistan.  Some readers enjoy the non-fiction book: THREE CUPS OF TEA, about aid projects in war torn Afghanistan.  A more light reading can be found in A CUP OF FRIENDSHIP, by Deborah Rodriquez or THE BOOKSELLER OF KABUL.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great time killer.....spend a lot of my time playing. Got stuck a couple of times, but I figured it out eventually.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|As a parent, this book was haunting yet relatable. I'd actually give it 4.5 stars if I could. I'm not normally a murder-mystery reader, but I really enjoyed this.

B000EXDS5M|1.0|There were many scenes cut out of this DVD (I used to own it) and being a collectors edition I am extremely disappointed. I almost sent it back and demanded another version. I'll purchase another version elsewhere.
B00908DDZM|5.0|Just being from Seattle wasn't good enough, I love this album. I feel that a good number of the songs will end up on the radio that aren't in use currently.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|One of the &#34;Best&#34; albums ever ! Zac Brown Band just keeps getting better all the time. Can't wait until the next album.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I've been a big Darius Rucker fan for a long time, as I've been a big Hootie and the Blowfish fan since the beginning.  As a longtime country music fan, nothing could have made me happier than when Darius began making country music.  This CD is just as perfect as his previous CD's, which I have and listen to very very often.  There is no better driving music than a CD player full of Darius Rucker on a long road trip. (Just driving around town I listen to them also; just can't get through all of them on a short trip.)  This CD is a must have for serious Darius fans; those who don't know Darius Rucker's music, start with this CD; you'll want all of them.

1878424319|5.0|I think this is a must read for everyone.  It is simple to read and makes some excellent points that you should carry throughout your life.  The first few chapters are not indicative of the &#34;4 agreements&#34; themselves and once you get through the chapters, the 4 agreements will be life changing.  I am improving my communication skills greatly with a few simple things I have learned from this book and have given it to 10 of my friends.  If you want to do some self exploration and tackle some issues in your life, this is a great starting point to continue to learn and grow!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I wish I'd have seen this in the theaters in 3D, it would have been stunning I'm sure. Well worth the watch.

I follow this band closely, have every CD (even the later releases) and kept hoping I would find a song or two to like on the recent releases.  Geoff blew it and I hope the guys don't look back and give me 25 more years of this TRUE Queensryche sound!<br /><br />Bravo!!!!!!

B005P1YCNK|4.0|The author makes you stop and think about the things you do on a daily basis. I'm going to put into practice what I learned from the book.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|In the world of really bad movies that are absolutely entertaining to watch, this rates fairly low for me. It wasn't awful to the point I shut it off...but I wanted more...camp or something.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|One of the better books I've read in a while. I recommend this 100%. Not everything is perfect and the story is no without faults, how ever.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This was a great use of characters to involve the prior cast with the new cast.  The actors that were casted fit their position quite well.  Thanks.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|This prequel to the Wizard of OZ story is a throw back to the original storytelling.  Unlike many of the other modern fairy tale retellings ( Snow White, Red Riding Hood, Alice in Wonderland) this story is light bright and friendly. Sue ther are some jump moments but nothing most 9 year olds could not handle.  Nothing can match the 1939 Wizard of OZ for bringing a fairytale to the screen. OZ The Great and Powerful will likely become the next classic big screen fairytale adventure.
B000FBJHZS|2.0|But this one was such a disappointment I didn't finish it. The only other book in my decades-old life I didn't finish my German Shepard ate. One positive thought I had after closing out after a few chapters: maybe I could be a successful writer after all if this is what is selling these days. I had to re-read a James Lee Burke novel to clear my head and be reassured that thrillers can be superbly written and qualify as literature.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is a very funny television show, and rated number one for good reasons. It is smart, funny, challenging, and the characters are very engaging. The writers have continued to introduce new characters that enhance the cast and provide new situations for the core characters to interact with, and that happens to great effect in Season Three.
B00CISAPJS|5.0|Not too violent with lots of funny scenes. I watched it three times already and still laugh as much as the first time I watched it.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|most of the time the game wouldn't let me in.<br />so in less you have a lot of apps I wouldn't recamend it.
B007V9YF5E|1.0|Payed 6.99 for this video and after hours of reinstalling adobe flash,silver light etc. still won't work will never buy from you again.<br /><br />I would like my money back, whats wrong with you guys?
B009GEDP26|4.0|I don't normally watch police procedurals, but this one is highly entertaining. I really enjoy Nathan Fillion's acting style, and the way all the actors bounce off of each other is very enjoyable. This season doesn't have quite as much humor to it as the past seasons, but it's still a must-watch in our house.
B002ZG9788|2.0|doesnt make sense at all<br />simple package<br />not 7.1<br />visual effect too weak<br />not cheap at all<br />not a good deal
B007ONSLLQ|4.0|Seeing Halestorm in concert next week - wanted to hear more than the one radio play song.  Some songs are a little pop music styled but they can rock out nicely.Lizzie Hale is a great singer who can belt out a song.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I am a huge Diana Krall fan and I believe that I own everything that she has ever recorded. Having said that, this CD is shockingly bad.  The arrangements, and I use the term loosely are amaterurish at best.  The quality of the recording is horrible as well.  The paino itself sounds like they searched through junk shops to find an old, out of tune upright.  Next time I will need to listen to the previews.  With Diana Krall I never thought that would be necessary.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Unrealistic storyline but great cases with a never ending drama in house as cases are resolved. The main lawyer makes the show as he deals with personal issues and and a secret he must jeep hidden
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love the way it makes you think. I get so frustrated way I get stuck on a level. I still keep playing when I know I have to get up early.
B004FRB3OQ|5.0|So, I like to keep my iTunes library on a 64gb SDXC card that sits flush inside my Macbook's Expresscard slot, to save space on my SSD.  The only other expresscard I'd found that was able to accept a card \\"all the way in\\" was this Transcend one: [[ASIN:B0054VVRBQ Transcend Express Reader UHS 1 TS RDF1]]<br /><br />Unfortunately, it needed a driver, which was a little buggy in Snow Leopard, but worked. It was very very buggy in Mountain Lion and tended to kernel panic when ejected.<br />I bought this sonnet adapter, and it happily shows up with no driver at all.
034580709X|4.0|The Bat has all the signs of a first novel written and rewritten over many years. The pop references and technology span at least two decades, it sounds unnatural for a 20 year-old in the mid-90s to be making casual references to songs and movies from the 70s mixed in with contemporary ones. Characters have mobile phones in some scenes, but mobile technology is clearly unknown in most of the book. The Internet comes and goes similarly. In one particularly incongruous scene, the police are using mobile telephones to discuss tracking an undercover decoy who appears to have a radio transmitter from the 1950s, so large the bad guy would notice if it were strapped to her body so she has to carry it in a bag; its range seems to be limited to line of sight. No one asks why she doesn't just use her phone to call and tell the police where she is, or just leave her phone on and let them listen.<br /><br />More seriously, the focus wanders to the point that it's not clear who the main character is or what is important in the plot. Many scenes are entirely unmotivated. There are clumsily inserted digressions to explain things about Australian history and geography, Norway and Aboriginal mythology. Momentum is wildly uneven with chapters going by with nothing happening, followed by major developments in between chapters. Clues are placed with [[ASIN:B00BWDMEBC Agatha Christie]] artificiality.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a satisfying book, just not up to the professional standards of the later books in the series. Things start coming together in the second half of the book and the Harry Hole character begins to emerge and stand on his own. While the plot is overembroidered, it does hang together logically.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the author or the main character, this book will be thoroughly enjoyable--just a bit rough around the edges--and will deepen your understanding of Harry Hole. On the other hand, if you have not read the other books and are thinking of getting started, I would not choose this one. I recommend [[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast]] instead. It's the third novel but the first fully-realized one, and also the first set in Norway which reduces some unnecessary complications.<br /><br />Since I don't speak Norweigan, I'm not qualified to comment on the translation, other than to say that it feels more heavy-handed and intrusive in this one. The other books I have read in the series, all in English translation, preserved some feel of the original language and rendered colloquialisms literally, which I enjoy. This one had all that stripped away (except for one Norweigan word and a running joke about pronouncing the main character's name), so it might as well have been written orginally in English. I prefer a lighter touch, but I don't know if the difference is the original book or the translator.started, I would not choose this one. I recommend [[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast]] instead.

B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I really loved the way this season was shot. Although there were a ton of flashbacks in almost every episode...
B007FIY3VW|4.0|I used this app to write a large document while on vacation totally on my Kindle Fire HD,  I did use a Bluetooth keyboard.  While there are stability issues, It crashes periodically, the file recovery system works extremely well and I never lost any work.<br /><br />The document I worked on was over 5 meg and included hypertext and pictures from screenshots saved to my Kindle.<br /><br />I like it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing!!!! It's just like subway surfers and temple run all smushed together!!!! I love the little minions! I play this game all the time! Get this game! :D
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|I can't tell you how much this game series has affected my life. Intense game play, Great story telling and plot twists. If you're a typical Call of Duty player who has more emphasis on run and gun type of games then this isn't the series for you. If you want to sneak around and plot your stealth action as secret agent then the MG(S) series is for you.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book was a poor attempt to drag out the series.  Can I have my money back please?  I was very disappointed.
B005PK56TA|5.0|This show started out really weird for me and I couldn't decide if I liked it.  I kept watching and was hooked.  I went through the entire season in a week.  I've heard that the second season is completely different so I hope that I'm not disappointed.  If you are unsure, keep watch it.  You will grow to love it.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR THIS APP, BUT MY SON LIKES THIS JUST LIKE TALKING TOM. THEY THINK IT IS FUNNY TO LISTEN TO THE DOG TALK.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Well for three days this game has been working perfectly and all this sudden its stopped working please help me.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is a lot like Temple Run. You go through different obstacles which are really cool. You can unlock different minions. Which is really cool. There are 3 lanes with rockets, and other minions which you can get for extra points. This app is really great. I recommend this app for all ages.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Not something I would have chosen but recommended by my daughter. I really loved it and it held my attention on every page.
B005C8ENI0|3.0|The movie was not really what I expected based on the title, so it threw me off balance right from the beginning. I was an atypical lawyer movie displaying the seedier side of defending entitled criminals that are guilty. Three stars might be too generous.....
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Took me a while to own this movie, but I must say it was well worth it. Especially on blueray.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game that keeps you on your toes.  Great animation and lots of fun. I love the minions!
B00CH26TL8|1.0|It's quite complicated and hard to understand<br />I would definitely NOT recommend this to a friend<br />I'll just do some more hunting.....
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Had no problems camping because I had this to keep all the blades sharp.  Very easy to use on any small knives.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Another good season, maybe not as great as the first two seasons, but still a quality period soap opera (just as I've come to expect from the BBC).
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Paper Towns was amazing, John Green is amazing, and if you were expecting a detailed review you're at a loss
B000R4SMCW|5.0|Good story, REALLY god acting, and some interesting plot twists.<br />Excellent viewing for all !!!!  (Actually, I replaced a previously damaged copy)
B003ELY7PG|3.0|I bought this book because of it's different take on the business model in the new economy. It did take a different perspective and gave me insight into the way that business can leverage the technology now available. However this book is really more aimed at either existing or start up businesses. Without an interest in my own business the books ideas only appeal to a limited degree.<br />I could imagine that for those with an interest in setting up their own business the information provided here could be very interesting.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|I enjoy playing this game but always run out of time. Forusold folks who take longer to figure it out, would love to see you add a Timeless or Relaxed mode so people like me can relax and enjoy the game more.me
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|In a Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson. Marvelous funny travelogue that teaches you a lot about Australya. Serious long companion book would be The Fatal Shore.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This show is both entertaining and historical.  It gives our family something we can all enjoy and discuss the issues that the characters must face and how they deal with them.  We take the time to research some of the historical events, including things like the first toaster, what kind of cars they ride in, fashion, government, monarchy, laws, etc.  It has become more than just a tv drama.
B00A77II0U|5.0|this was my first alawar game ,and I thought it was fun. nice graphics and good story line. the puzzles were fun and each lead you a new part of the story.
