B0071XO8RA|4.0|This collection of books hooks you with questions that lead to other questions.  While some of the findings are anticipated, there are unusual twists that keep the story alive.<br /><br />Howard did a wonderful job creating characters you care about while proving early on that they all are  vulnerable.  This keeps the reader on edge.<br /><br />I would of liked to of seen a more in depth development of the &#34;villains&#34; such as Peter, Sam  and Howard.  This would of offered more depth to why things were done.  Perhaps Mr. Howard will offer alternate views of the development of the reasons behind the choices made in his promise of additional books.  It would be interesting to see how other silos developed and what other choices might have resulted in.<br /><br />I enjoyed this series.  An alternate world was successfully created and characters developed which I cared about.  There remains many opportunities for expansion now that a committed following has been developed.  The author can now proceed without fearing the loss of his audience due to our short attention span.<br /><br />I he that those who have invested in the first five books will be notified as more are completed.<br /><br />Thank you for your hard work.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Six Words: High Definition Slow Motion Fight Scene. Those words could earn this movie a perfect score alone. Lots of humor, and action. Great actors performing amazingly as usual. Entertaining from start to finish.
B000YHG72E|5.0|The kids loved it and laughed the whole way through! We will add it to our Christmas movie collection to watch every year.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|THIS CD WAS THE BOMB.I AM KE$HA'S BIGGEST FAN I REALLY AM AND THIS IS WHAT IVE BEEN WAITING FOR FROM HER
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is an awesome compilation of classical and modern goodness wrapped all up into one piece of sweetness! Definetely worth the money and would make a perfect gift for anybody on your list!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I loved the Swedish version of this film, even with just the subtitles, but the English remake has it's unique differences that make it just as enjoyable. I no longer have to read subtitles, it has Daniel Craig, an awesome animation intro played with a cover of Immigrant Song, and some more violence. The DVD version is interesting because of the movie's hacker theme; the disc art is portrayed as a bootlegged copy with The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo printed on as if written in Sharpie, which confused several less observant people. I fully recommend the purchase of this movie in any shape or form.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|Not sure this wouldn't work on the Kindle touch? No option to refund digital content, waste of money. Wish I could at least get the paper version
1476715904|4.0|Layken is uprooted from her life in Texas after her father's death. Her mom moves her and her brother to far away to start a new life. And there she meet Will, her next door neighbor, and potential soul mate.<br />Will and Layken forge an irresistable bond, but something comes to light that tears them apart. Now, they are forced to stay friendly, while inside each person is pining for the other. But through Slam Poetry, maybe another bond can be formed. Maybe it's a way to communicate, when conversation fails.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. Thank you Colleen Hoover. It's been a while since I've sat on the couch and read for hours, not wanting to do anything, including watch The Vampire Diaries. Seriously. I recorded it for later. I had to. I needed to finish reading this. It was so good.<br />I'm going to try my best not to give anything away.<br /><br />Will is funny, strong and personable. He's a great male lead, sensitive and mature. I loved the brothers, fantastic comic relief. Eddie is priceless and sweet, full of goodness. And Layken is pretty cool. I liked her inner monologue and her inner frustrations seemed genuine and real to me, although sometimes a bit dramatic. (A few times, I wanted to tell her to snap out of it because she was being a baby.)<br /><br />I loved the Slam Poetry scattered throughout the book and how the author used it to forge these strong bonds between characters. I loved the romance because it was organic and sweet. And I loved the twist. I can't say what it is, but this book is more than just a teenage romance. It's more than a coming of age story.<br />Colleen Hoover, I applaud you. My heart broke, my heart soared.<br />I'll be thinking about this novel for a while.<br /><br />For more of my reviews, please visit The Windy Pages dot com!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Sometimes I think I know Harry Bosch even better than my own brother. I like the same music he does, I feel sad for the same facts of life as he does. I'm even older that he is. I greatly appreciate persons with solid moral principles but I appreciate even more those who are not paralyzed by those principles and accept to go beyond their principles if their conscience tells them they should. As you sure realize, this describes perfectly Harry Bosch.<br />In &#34;The Black Box&#34;,  Michael Connelly uses everything we hope to find : a boss that does not like Harry, a case with the Internal Affairs, a request for help from a former lover, Harry's concerns to be a good teenager's father, a corrupt sheriff who aspires to become a congressman, ...<br />I'm already longing to read that Michael Connelly will publish soon another Harry Bosch's novel.

B003HZYRK4|5.0|Great book to read. I enjoyed this book very much. It talks about the possibility of the mind and how powerful the mind is and can be.
B0017I1FNK|2.0|Emmylou is on a roll to put the world to sleep! Unfortunately she has continued again and again and again with a very muddy production sound which would be ok with great songs, but here the songs are just BORING AGAIN -- just like Red Dirt Girl and Stumble she stumbles again. They all sound exactly the same! zzzzzzzzzzzz Avoid.
B008476HBM|3.0|Even though there were more than a few times I had to look up some word that I didn't know. I found this book to be very good
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A epic story of romance, power, and survival.  An interesting diversion from modern day life. I would recommend this series.
B0072OFOM6|5.0|I have been following this series right from the start. Can't wait for the the new one to start in Jan.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|The case took a few days to break-in before my Olympus FE-3010 would slide in and out without effort. The FE is a compact camera that measures 2.2\\"H x 0.8\\"D x 3.7\\"W.  The sides of the case have a large pleat, which can expand to the appropriate size for the camera, up to a max. of about an inch in thickness.  This case can accommodate a slightly larger camera than the FE, but anything measuring more than 1/4 inch in HxDxW the measure of the FE is going to be tight. The case has a magnetic closure that's strong enough to secure the case closed when traveling, but not to the point where you can't access the camera quickly. A nice design feature is a keyhole cutout at the top of the case that allows a lanyard attached to the camera to slip through. I've looked at several cases, most of which in this price point are nylon or synthetic leather. This is a nice leather case for short money. Recommended.
1423101502|5.0|The last Olympian by Rick Riordan  <br /><br />I completely loved this book. It was so good that I didn't want to read it because I didn't want to it to end. The book intrigued me and made me want to read more and more. One thing that a great book should have is a hook. This book definitely had a hook. <br /><br />One of my favorite parts was the ending. Something very surprising happens but I won't say any more because I don't want to give any thing away. All I am saying is that this book is unexpected.<br /><br />The whole main idea of this book is that Percy and all of camp half blood are uniting together to save the world. They try to save the world by defeating Kronos the evil Titan lord. Manhattan is Percy's home town and he doesn't want to just sit around watching it get destroyed. Percy and his friends are doing all they can to help, but is it enough? I don't know you'll have to find out. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008476HBM|5.0|Wonderful story...after seeing the movie..I just had to read the book...so worth it!!  The characters came alive in full glory.  Loved it.
0765367297|5.0|I loved this book in the original version and am looking forward to reading it again in it's updated edition<br /><br />this book will be a favourite of any sci-fi fan

0439023491|4.0|Catching Fire by Suzanne collins<br /><br />I think Catching Fire was a great book ,though it wasn't as good as The Hunger Games, it was still pretty good. The reason I gave this book four stars was because it was pretty boring at the start,but don't let that fool you!  Once you get past the boring  part, the book is very  exciting. The Quarter Quell happens in this book. The Quarter Quell is when,every twenty-five years,one boy and one girl victor from each district go into the arena. One of my favorite parts is when Katniss and Finnick make themselves look like zombies and scare Peeta. If you have read The Hunger Games you are probably going to read this, but if you haven't read it,so you can get to this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book,all though fiction, follows the beginnings of World War One with characters that represent the period with great accuracy. This novel holds your interest through out.
B008NMT684|5.0|I downloaded this for my 2 1/2 year old son but my 4 year old niece loves it too. Very easy for him to figure out and he loves to pop the balloons at the end of every puzzle. I purchased the extra puzzles because he likes it so much!
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I'm not sure what to say besides...buy this album.  This band is so great. They have a great sound and the singers voice is something new.  It's refreshing.
142314189X|5.0|This is my favorite book series's  that I've ever read!<br />This book is about mystery, betraying friends, sadness, happiness,danger, and           Adventure.<br />My favorite part in the series Is the part where Luke (Percy's trainer) betrays Percy to be poisened by the scorpion!<br />If you like the series of unfortunate events than you'll like this series.<br />My favorite book of the series is the battle of the labyrinth.<br />I hope you like the series!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I would definitely recommend to any Mitch Albom fan. Another thought provoking book. Makes you consider the real meaning of time.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really love this app.  It is very useful and very simple to manage timed things. My daughter uses it when she is trying to hold her breath, we use it as the timer to buzz when her time is up on the kindle.  What I like the most is with the alarm you program any song.  With this feature she has actually started (key word - started)  to get up on he'd own

0393339882|5.0|If you can put this book down after opening the first page, you didn't get it.As Pauli would say it , \\"you're not even wrong\\".All the major players in this account would adopt Mr. Kumar as a son for he understand and seems to love each one totally without taking sides.From the beginning to the very his great heart and superb mind abound on every page, The Solvay Conferences of 1927 and 1930 were the ultimate Ring Fights of the century, The two HeavyWeight Physics Boxers of the world fighting it out with breathtaking moves, each swing described round by round with in your face vividness by Mr. Kumar. Bohr and Einstein go at it and we have the best ring side seats because of this incredible book. What's at stake? Nothing less than the fundamental nature of reality.
B005IQZB14|3.0|The main character continued to make mistakes in her life despite the rigours of the trail.  I kept hoping she would be moved to change her life but she struggled and it made the read frustrating. Still a good book,  read it for yourself.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|I learned a lot about the war history that was not know to me about the countries where they where fighting .It made the story more interesting . The people who where in it where more alive and kept moving around and where very involved in the action which made it come alive. I couldn't wait to keep reading more.The towns where my inlaws came from seem different than what I had heard of and I can't wait to read the next book.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Too many American colloqualisms that collide with the British colloqualisms. But it is a super toxic screwed up relationship story that most women can relate to in some capacity (maybe minus the unique S&M aspect!). I am a writer and I actually really enjoyed this book. But I recognize it is pretty poorly written but the story is unique enough to overlook the writing.
B007MDB548|3.0|My granddaughters (4&7) loved it because they are really into Tinkerbell.  For adults, it is cute and amusing.  3D was good.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Persona 4 is one of those few games that defies easy pigeon holing: its part murder mystery, part personal drama, teen high-school romance, and a hack-n-slash RPG with micromanaging resource side games.<br /><br />You play the traditional silent protagonist, living with your uncle in a remote town, when murders start to occur, tied to a mystery world within TV's that reveals peoples darkest secrets and natures.<br /><br />First off, the cast is wonderful and almost fully voiced, and not a single character is one-dimensional. Characters are deep and felshed out over the course of multi-layered interactions where you grow to connect with them and help them overcome their personal strifes.<br /><br />The gameplay is simple and straightforwd, and once a healthy level is reached, you could feasibly grind through the randomized dungeons ad nauseum. Nestled into this is a Pokemon like hunt for the Personas, reflections of your personality based on mythological and religious figures that you can cycle through to adopt various powers and strengths, or pick the one you like and buff them up to maximum level, swapping and growing skills with a nice roulette style bonus system for winning fights in a strategic manner.<br /><br />But the combat is completely overshadowed by the complex web of personal development, dating games, and other side quests that challenge you to figure out how to best utilize your time: who do you spend time with and help hone their skills, or do you work at a job to get enough cash for new gear, or do you study and try to ace your midterms and impress all of your friends at once.<br /><br />And thats just within the game. Fans will love the TV olerlay which brings in a little quiz show about the setup, and references and movies from the previous games of the Persona series, all of which are amusing and at least worth a few extra points.<br /><br />While this is a rerelease of a title from the mid 2000's, it's been polished to a high mirror shine. A few nits are still present, but they are so few and far between as to be unmentionable.<br /><br />The difficulty curve is a little harsh to begin with, especially if you play on a higher difficulty, and the random chance of a TPK from a lucky enemy power is still possible, but apart from that increasingly rare occurance as you level and improve, this game is easily worth the 60-70 hours you can dump into even a single playthrough, all of it worth the effort and even the few tears this game can ellicit.nits are still present, but they are so few and far between as to be unmentionable.<br /><br />The difficulty curve is a little harsh to begin with, especially if you play on a higher difficulty, and the random chance of a TPK from a lucky enemy power is still possible, but apart from that increasingly rare occurance as you level and improve, this game is easily worth the 60-70 hours you can dump into even a single playthrough, all of it worth the effort and even the few tears this game can ellicit.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another Albom novel which really makes one think about their relationships with family and friends. It made me think how inter-related all of us are (even folks we don't know), though we don't realize it.

B002OR0RP0|1.0|I was not able to watch it because it kept stopping so I turned it off.  Too aggravating.  It was the first time that has happened.
B009329Y30|3.0|I may have enjoyed the movie more if I had not read the book first. It was disappointing that it did not follow the book more closely. They wrote the ex-husband as less of a bully and less abusive than he was in the book.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I loved the first two movies in the Nolan Batman Trilogy, but this one is just plain horrible in my opinion (2hrs & 45min of horrible). I read the comics when I was younger, and loved the dark overtone of Frank Miller's Bat-Man. That being said, I always thought that Bane was a poorly conceived character, definitely not worthy of being Bat-Man's &#34;Final Foe&#34;. The movie version is no better, silly-looking muscle-guy with a Vader respirator. I couldn't even understand what he was saying half the time (Amazon really needs to offer subtitles). Anne Hathaway as Catwoman, seriously? When I first heard that she got the part, i was as shocked as when I discovered that Heath Ledger was gonna play the Joker (I never imagined he would do such a great job, so I gave her the benefit of the doubt). Sadly though, Anne portrays as horrible a Catwoman as Halley Berry, and she and the director obviously new nothing about the character either (she didn't even have a cat at her home). The part of Nightwing, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is the one that delivers a solid performance this time around. The story is poorly adapted for the screen, and wasn't that great to begin with. Definitely one of the worst finales for a great trilogy.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The best surprise is the story line....these books have a fantastic story. Here is to hoping they make a movie out of this! Loved them all!
0679722610|5.0|It's simply one of the best hardboiled books I've read. In my opinion it surely surpasses the Maltese Falcon. Hammett writes with urgency and compels you not to stop reading until it's done. Action here in nearly non-stoping, but the book truly shines in its dialogues, smartly crafted and believable. Surely a Top 5 Noir book. The quality of the paper and the cover are also above avarage when you consider it's a paperback. Very pretty art and fitting with the theme and genre.
B007SGM084|5.0|This has to be by far the best book series I have read in a long time. I recommend that ALL HUSBANDS read this. Whether you are recently married or a long timer (like me) this book can spice things up
0783240236|5.0|Great movie that stands the test of time. Not sure what to say about a DVD of a movie that I've seen a thousand times, but it's definitely worth watching.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I cant stop killing zombies! The game play is great. The different types of zombies make each level a fun new challenge.
B0084HJE0S|3.0|It is a good reading, but I was expecting more in depth analysis. Anyway, it was worth the money invested, but I would expected a better cost benefit return.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This book was hard to get into but half way it gets as interesting as the first too. Must read to end the trilogy!
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The movie works and the packaging seems to be original, but I don't know how you can sell a copied DVD legally. I have to wonder if I am I in violation of something by keeping it. Used is not the same as buying a copy.
B005LAIIPS|4.0|The Bourne Legacy is a better movie than people say. I get Roger Ebert Reviews from the Chicago sun times and mister Ebert talked about flashback footage to the previous Bourne movie. The new Jason Bourne is good and the film shows him undergoing survival training as an agent. Most fans would rather have the Bourne franchise go on than not. I have written Bourne movie treatments having taken a writers course. It is possible that Matt Damon might return some day as Jason Bourne to the big screen, allegedly Matt Damon has Universal send him Bourne Movie treatments to read. Edward Norton is a great actor and so is Rachel Weisz.
0375507256|5.0|The synopsis and reviews cover the unique structure of the novel, but what I found fascinating and compelling was the interwoven concepts of human ethics and slavery that brought all the stories together.
B0052UYJDC|1.0|This is the opposite of hording. I agree with her on not having to have a couch,we got rid of ours this past year. However we substituted 3 chairs to take it's place.  White walls, no pictures,  no sign that the house is lived in.  I don't know of many people who could happily live like that for very long.  After reading some of this E-book I had to stop, it was too depressing. I thought to my self, &#34;at least they don't have children.... Went on her web site to see what she was all about. Low and behold she does have a daughter.  I hope that she at least puts the little ones drawings on the frige.<br />I do think that most people do collect too much junk. Consumerism is over the top. People are going into debt buying things that will be obsolete by the time they get the purchase home. So her book did make me rethink and declutter my home, but I still won't get rid of my husband's great grandparents Christmas ornaments they brought from Germany.

B0076DELIG|4.0|Enjoyable read with typical inside the mind of Harry Bosch detail.  His daughter is growing up and his memory of old cases is still a great part of his dedication to justice for victims.
0553381407|5.0|if you have toxic parents or didn't know you had, read this book. It helped me see many things I thought were &#34;normal&#34;... It doesn't mean your parents are either toxic or not, I think you can have something in the middle... It helped me see some not so healthy issues in my family..
B009JBWOU0|5.0|Happy I found a trilogy of TDK on DVD for such a low price. Bought as a gift for my brother who doesnt have a blu-ray player, haven't opened it yet, but looks good!
0810982943|1.0|Book was completely written in thoughout.  If the book was written in throughout it should have stated that in disclaimer.
B005LAII1C|4.0|This movie now has meaning to me because it's the first movie I bought on Blu-Ray, and the picture quality is awesome. Ted is a very funny and highly offensive movie from the creator of Family Guy. In the 1980's, a lonely kid named John Bennett receives a teddy bear for Christmas. He makes a magical wish that it could talk. The next day, he comes to life. 27 years later, John and Ted are still BFFs. John's girlfriend, Lori wants to Ted to move out so John can have a life with her. Most of the movie consists of getting high and making offensive jokes, but deep down, this movie actually has a heart. If you like MacFarlene's kind of humor, you'll love TED!!!
B005F3GMAO|5.0|A must read for people who are interested in Richard Branson.<br /><br />I simply could not put it down as I read through his beginnings, balloon exploits and how he has turned into a man who is using everything he built to make a better world for all of us.<br /><br />Hopefully we can all be half the man he is and this would be a much better world.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B006H5120E|5.0|4 Disc combo, not like you even need it but why not?! Needed this movie on blu-ray for my gf since she missed it when they brought the movie back into theaters. Hope she likes it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Warning!!!  Contents HIGHLY ADDICTIVE!!!  And maddening!  You will wonder why oh why this was ever cancelled?  It is clearly the highest caliber show of shows with great cast, sets, dialog, you name it Firefly has it, except more episodes.  With all the reality dumbing down nonsense that is the norm nowadays, this little outer space cowboy show that is superbly written and acted is a true gem.  The cast is scattered to all ends of this verse, but we, the faithful, can hope that with Joss's success with the screenplay and directing of the Avengers, that his Hollywood cache can propel at least another movie out of this stunning show.<br />Browncoat faithful now and always, you're on my crew, why are we still talking about this?
B006UHZ7OQ|4.0|This product works great and alleviates the neck pain of having my very heavy 60d with 18-200mm hanging from my neck. It's also nice to go out and put my telephoto on the chest plate and my &#34;landscape&#34; lens on the holster.  There are safety tethers which go to each camera which leads me to my next point: careful of the side holster. If you go to sit down and depending on the angle, you can very easily slide the camera out of the side holster and have it go flying. Being low to the ground the tether did nothing for me and my camera hit the floor. Luckily no damage resulted. Soooo with that said, be wary of the side holster, it's position and downward motion.  Second area for improvement is better documentation. A bit overpriced at $189 and I still wonder if I should have taken a chance on the much cheaper Opteka version. At the time I didn't get it because of some concerns about the side holster. But seeing that I had issues with this one, the $39.95 Opteka might be something you should consider. In any event this product did live up to most of my expectations.
B0024FADDI|5.0|IT'S ARMY OF DARKNESS.... NUFF SAID!!! If you haven't seen this movie and you're a scifi fan you must see this movie.
B001AW156U|5.0|These triggers are perfect for anyone who wants a better grip on their controller. They allow you to feel the triggers better and fit your fingers better.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|A true classic!  Enjoy it year after year and passing on this copy to our daughter for her two little ones.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Bought for kindle fire. Really enjoying so far. I would recommend . It's fun and basic. I am sure it does a lot more than basic solitaire but I'm happy with it.
B002436WFI|5.0|Movie was entertaining from start to finish.  This movie will entertain both adults and children.  My wife and I truly enjoyed it and will simply sum it up in one word.  FANTASTIC!!
B004QPOVF0|5.0|EXCELLENT, the best concert ever of AC-DC. Higly recomendable and one of the better performance that they have played ever.
B008LSVLZG|5.0|DVD was excellent.  Great quality, sound, video and excellent songs.  There's only one thing I would have changed.  Instead of the live version of Remainder the Black Dog, I once saw a terrific (and very wierd) video version of it.  I was hoping this would have been on this DVD.  Oh well, I'm still very pleased.  Since Fripp and King Crimson have pretty much hung it up, Steven Wilson is a great fix.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Definitely a good book. Don't read the reviews though before you read the book because people end up spoiling it for you. Great message though
B000IZ8DZQ|5.0|This is the original story and is so much better then the remake.  Plenty of humor and action.  I first saw this film while in Vietnam and such a relief from all that was happening.  You have to root for the 'bad guys' as they try to outwit the real 'bad guys'.  They do get away with their plan, but do they really get away with it.  A film with a true 'cliff hanger' and remember, &#34;Nobody move!&#34;
B008YRVW0I|5.0|awesome game. If you like puzzle games this is for you. plus you outfit a fish tank with decorate and pick the fish also.
B0001VTPWM|5.0|I've always been a fan of the Robocop series. I think both actors bring a lot to the table with their wonderful, amazing portrayals of Robocop. When I ordered this, I didn't check my DVD library first. I'm keeping this trilogy because it takes less space than the 3 individual DVDs; I have a huge movie library with hundreds of titles. Each of the three movies has a compelling plot and entertaining action.
B009G7ZYPY|4.0|Song are very good.  I think she could have done better on Somewhere Over the Rainbow.. I enjoyed many if the songs
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case was everything I hoped it would be.  I would highly recommend it !  I love the red color!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|great movie, as good as 1st if not better. Did not beat 2nd movie, but what would. apple apple apple
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|4 stars for extremely entertaining and funny.  This movie is true to life and lets everyone laugh at themselves and see life as it really happens.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a cool Cd. Especially after not having to pay the regular high price for this Cd. But I'm glad I now have this Cd.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This is pornography for women. I am honestly shocked that girls are admitting to reading this. I decided I had to check out what all the fuss was about and was pretty appalled. There are certainly some hot scenes, but the writing and story itself is extremely over the top/childish and comes off as quite implausible.
1579128149|5.0|Having originally seen this book in stores, I instantly gravitated toward it due to its beautiful pictures that make you view the elements that make up our world in a whole new light. All the images are high quality, of great color, and they provide the best possible visual examples of either the elements natural state or products that are made with that particular element. On the edge of each page is a table featuring pertinent information such the temperatures in which the element exists as a solid/liquid/gas, the atomic weight, density, etc. However, the greatest information comes from the short paragraph on the page of each element. Gray does an outstanding job of providing interesting facts and information about each element, often in the form of the common uses of the element or unique properties that make it stand out from the rest of the periodic table. Gray's writing is very down to earth and is written in a manor easily understood by everyone regardless of your chemistry knowledge. Ultimately this book is visually stunning and fascinating from an information perspective. I would highly recommend it anyone who is interested in science!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This cool little puzzle game is very cool you should get this game :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)  :)
1451695187|5.0|Inspirational read. Belief is a choice that I choose. I'm sure also there are many who will choose something else.
B007HACDLK|5.0|My favorite author comes through again!  Great read, good story, & Mitch comes thru again.  Some interesting twists to the story.
B003IY48PS|5.0|i cant beleive what a nice quality. it is really amazing watch this movie all over again it make you feel like you were in the theater. the price is amaizing :D
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|Good story line, entertainers and their weird world. Plot is very real and nail-biting. I like her, Heat's counterpart, Rook and her detective co-horts are a good group. You'll like it too.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|i choose this rating because is a brand new blu ray :) good packaging and good price. i recommend this product to everyone!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|for a fiction it was well put together, a joy to read thank you Grisham. i am waiting forward for you next creation.
B006KSAPV0|5.0|love this movie is so interesting and keep you amused for the entire feauture. its hard to find moies like this anymore. the story is twisted.
B001GXF2YY|1.0|Buyer beware! This Kindle edition does not have Text-to-speech enabled.  I don't know why the text-to-speech was enabled in the first five.  its very disappointing
B0059XTTW8|3.0|It's unfair to people who have not read the novel and have not seen the Alec Guinness six-part film, to comment unfavourably.  I think it may have carried a little more weight on the cinema screen than on a TV monitor.  However, this movie did not have the time to paint the important and very distinct characters of Bland, Alleline, Esterhase, and indeed even Haydon who is so important in the story.  Ricki Tarr was played too amateur and naive.  Guillam was quite good, as was the too-little-seen Jim Prideaux.  The production work is excellent, though so much filming through window glass became tedious. The novel and the six-part both contained much wit and clever dialogue, which is missing here.  All that being said, my apologies for the moaning, but I am certain that anyone who has not read the novel (it does not tire after six readings!) or seen the six-part version will very much enjoy them, even after seeing this movie.t
B006XF5BTG|4.0|While I have had good advice from instructors in the past, I found this book very informative and easy to follow. I am now able to much better plan my meals and I really like the exercise routines. The definitions sections could be a bit shorter as they drag on a bit but overall its easy to read and informative.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I feared that this might turn out to be too lite, or too scholarly.  It is terrific.  Mr and Mrs Bennett are played as well as they were in the supreme 1980 version; here they are not clownish, yet still funny.  A very good balance of the real and the fantasy story. I think a viewer MUST be pretty familiar with the printed novel and at least one of the previous films, to get the best out of this.  It is long --- three hours? --- and the very end seems a little drawn out, but I was enchanted all the way through. Jemima Rooper pulls off the difficult task of fitting in to the early 1800's without either clashing or making fun of it; a very believable performance.  A lot of time and money and preparation must have gone into this excellent production.  You will not be disappointed --- but make sure you are familiar with the story first!
B0070R40V6|5.0|Have never been a particular fan of this genre but this book is really amazing. Grabbed my attention from the start and couldnt put it down.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a fan of the piano guys since the beginning.  I am so excited to finally have a CD. The Piano Guys music has such a unique blend of classic and pop, soothing and exciting, familiar and new.  I love it!  Now they need to make a Christmas CD!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|This book has received 5 star reviews for good reason.  To the reduced-star-reviewer, I wonder aloud how anyone, even a Harvard neuro-scientist, could offer all of the answers to the universe in a short book.  Really.  It took Dr. Alexander a few years to put this together, for our benefit, after his NDE. It neither specifies nor excludes any religion,but, rather, encompasses all of us, regardless of belief system, and our Creator. I was raised in the Christian faith, but am not from a strongly religious family.  That said, I have always absolutely known that God exists. I just know.  And I have seen miracles after prayer, even to the point that I am careful what I pray for. I found it interesting that there is a universal sound/word for our Creator. I have always called Him God.  I highly recommend this book to any/everyone. There is much to be gleaned from Dr. Alexander's experience.  I believe there was an extreme purpose to his experience and am grateful that he, an intelligent man, was the benefactor of all of this in order to hand it to us in book form. It has strengthened my hope and my faith in God. For the first time ever, I sent out an email encouraging friends and family to read a specific book, this one, and I have purchased additional copies for gifts.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|haven't figured out how to actually download it on my kindle fire.I would appreciate any ideas usually when I purchase something it loads automatically.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|This would be good for a young person. I guess I didn't see an age recommendation on the game when I got it.
B00000K3CR|4.0|Great movie. Brings back a lot of childhood memories! Watched it with my 10 year old son and he loved it as well!
0307887960|5.0|Well written material, informative, a doable life change, that is simple to use, and not complicated.  If you are ready to improve your life it is highly recommended.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love how it has all fifteenth sorts of games all in one!!! hare how you have to earn the money to buy more games... but over all love the app
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Found the book to be very interesting. No secrets given away, but appeared to be factual. Husband enjoyed it also.
B007SGLZP8|1.0|I was given this book as a gift so I won't take too much time... It was horrid. Grisham has always been a writer of fluff but this was a painful read.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book kept my interest the whole time. I couldn't stop reading! You relate to the characters and feel their pain and struggles throughout the entire book.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Suzanne Collins could've done better, yet over all, AMAZING! Very suspenseful and full of action, although the movie will probably be a chic flick.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This game on my kindle Fire hd is just to hard to play the buttoms are  not put where you can get to them easy and it just hard to play. I uninstalled this game.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|Michael Scott really got me hooked with his vivid detail and action and adventure in this book. Michael Scott is now my third favorite author.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A good combination of action and emotion. Not really knowing where it would take you. Always hoping,but  just  Not sure.
B000HT3P7E|2.0|First off, the premise of the show is ridiculous; a father is telling his young  teenage kids how he met their mother years ago, but his story includes every date and sexcapade he and his friends have ever had years earlier, in many lame details. I can't imagine anyone talking to their young kids about hopping from one affair to another, strip clubs and other immature shenanigans.<br /><br />The series is about a group of immature friends in their 30's, whose main pursuits in life are hanging out in a bar drinking, playing dumb pranks on each other and looking for someone to \\"bang\\". This word \\"banging\\" is the most used word in their dialogue, especially the self-indulgent, narcissist, womanizing Barney. Other words and phrases used in almost every episode are; slut, \\"no fatties\\", threesome, hot chicks, B**bs, and many more I am not allowed to post on Amazon. Sex seems to be the only subject these friends are interested in doing or talking about.<br /><br />OK, it is occasionally entertaining and not the worst comedy on TV, but overall fairly dumb with quite unlikable airhead jerky characters.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Another great CD by Diana.  Have most of here music and seem to never git tired of it. All the songs are good.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|My wife and me are die hard fans of LZ and she wanted to give me a pre-chrisas gift....almost we cried.Emotionally beautiful high quality video and sound..Well recorded.Than you Zepp for make us a memory
B005LAIGP0|4.0|Daniel Radcliffe does an admirable job in this new horror story from HAMMER Films.  Slow and steady paced as a good haunted house story should be, it delivers the scares in a measured tone and pace.  Much better than most of the recent &#34;scary&#34; gore fest style horror movies or stupid possession movies.
B005PK553C|5.0|I was not a fan at first but was bored one evening and decided to watch a few more episodes.  I live for my weekly dose of freaky weirdo creepy leaves you thinking for hours show.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|I used this film to teach narrative techniques for film in my English class. It has some great devices to carry along the plot and is funny in a very whimsical and subtle way.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|We saw him on American idol, and followed him all the way through.<br />  areal star with a naturally brilliant voice, and i wish him all the very best for his future.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Well written, excellent cast. Makes you really care about the characters and hope that they survive. I just love this show.
030758836X|1.0|I'm 40 years old I've read all my life I love to read and I will read anything.  This is the first book ever I have hated!  I love a good crazy person or hating someone but these people I just could have cared less what happened to them.  Don't waste your time.
B005VPRET4|5.0|I like the detail, but it's about 1/2 the size I thought it would be. But my daughter said to give 5 stars.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|goals are met with a little work that keeps you coming back to play. I like the different ponies you get to meet.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys exhibit creativity at its finest. They give new life to classical music and prove that it is not much different from the music of today. They are something people of all ages enjoy listening to. My five-year old nephew loves \\"Cello Wars\\" and my fifty something father (who's favorite band is KISS) even loves listening to them. So, even if you do not like classical music, you'll find at least one song by the Piano Guys that you can enjoy.
0385737947|5.0|I've wanted to read this series for about a year now and it took me less than a week to read the entire series, plus the prequel. It's that good.<br /><br />The Maze Runner is a dystopian novel about teen boys coming up in a box knowing only their names and no actual memories. They adjust and each person is given a task to perform in their small society to keep everything running smoothly. The \\"creators\\" send food once a week and a new boy every 30 days. Thomas, the main character is the newest. The day after he arrives a girl is sent, the only one ever, and a message is crumbled in her hands.<br /><br />The great parts? It includes a maze to which the doors close every night to keep out the man-made monsters in the maze. Runners go through it every day trying to find a way home and haven't succeeded in the 2 years they've been there. The girl speeds them up and each chapter is a cliff hanger somehow so it's near impossible to put the book down and actually sleep.<br /><br />The ending brings the novel to an entirely new level. You find out answers to questions you didn't even know you had and the need to start the next novel, The Scorch Trials, is immediate. Actually, I think of all 4 books The Scorch Trials was my favorite. They bring out the best (and worst) in the characters.<br /><br />The Death Cure rounds everything out and I was still surprised by the author down to the very last page in the epilogue. The good (and bad, depending on how you see it) aspect of this book is it leaves so many directions for your mind to take. There's one issue I had with Thomas in the third book and it affected everything; his memories. You'll know what I mean when you read it.<br /><br />So, after finishing the third I let my mind wander and went into deep cognitive thinking mode to figure out why such-and-such happened, the purpose of it all, etc. It was wonderful! But I love that about some novels, that everything isn't handed to you on a platter. That's what made this series so great.<br /><br />The only book I actually found issue with was the prequel, The Kill Order. The prologue set me up to think we would see Teresa and Thomas growing up together, the beginning of everything, the creators, etc. Instead, the entire book had completely new characters not featured in any other novel. I get it, I see why it was done this way, and the book was still good, but for the record it would have been 1,000 times better from Teresa and Thomas's points of view.<br /><br />All in all, though, I would highly recommend this series to anyone who likes dystopian fiction!so great.<br /><br />The only book I actually found issue with was the prequel, The Kill Order.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My 11 yr. old wanted to read this after I read it.  He loved it and is doing his novel study on it.
B008EZVNFE|5.0|It's obvious that the young Lianne La Havas is overwhelmingly talented. The CD is rich lyrically, instrumentally, and vocally with a high production quality. The disc also arrived in a very compact folded paper case with liner notes/lyrics. I prefer this over the antiquated, environmentally indestructible, and cumbersome plastic cases.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very interesting twists and turns in the plot. Probably not the best Grisham novel I've read, but still entertaining and worth getting.
0307592731|4.0|Product got here in a timely manner and was not ripped or torn in any way.  Wild is a great story and I can't wait to finish it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|when I wake up it helps me start my day it motervat me I use it during church I also use it when someone or somebody need a scripture in their life it comes in handy
B000055XMF|4.0|A good movie whose appeal has probably increased with the popularity of the style and culture displayed in it. Plus there is Sting, and that's always good.
0470876417|5.0|it is a good product. im going to buy another onces. i recived my package on time. Thanks for all
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I have had this app for about 2 weeks now.  I usually use it several times a day for yoga practice, relaxation and to help me get  to sleep at night.
B0030T1NAO|5.0|The acting, the writing are both outstanding. A classic. Will be sorry to see it end. Do not miss this
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's story, simply from a physical standpoint, seems incredible. Menengitis is a devestating illness that rarely leaves the afficted with no after affects and often with no life.  As extraordinary as his medical recovery was, even more so was the spiritual journey that he embarked upon.  Almost all the descriptions of his amazing journey reflect closely many religious descriptions of what God is althought there is no doubt that orthodox religious types will be dismissive solely on the lack of dogma.  But as an expression of God's love and the nature of the universe, Dr. Alexander gives a beautiful and inspirational account.  I would recomend this book to anyone who has a nagging desire to find more purpose in life or simply wishes to understand that we are all, each of us, a part of the whole and to know this makes all of life more beautiful and meaningful.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is really fun and worth the money. The best game I have bought to date. The story is cute and interactive. My 5 year old even tries to play. HE even loves to watch me play.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I find this puzzle game fun and relaxing.  Looking forward to trying more puzzles.  I will be trying some of the more difficult ones.
B000WJSCZE|4.0|The book shows with good examples a proper and modern use of Power Point very useful for any one involved in public speaking
B004DK5CW4|5.0|This was a GREAT movie!!! An inspiration! I have, from a very young girl been enamored by this Beautiful Creation of God!!!<br />The movie arrived quickly and in excellent condition.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Story continues to be entertaining. I haven't read a book that fast in a long time. It's also fun to talk with friends about it since so many people have read the trilogy.
B000AYEL6U|4.0|I have loved this mini-series since the first time I saw it. If you like period dramas you'll enjoy this.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't wait for the 2nd book to see what else was coming up in the story. The book is easy to read and very entertaining. Not the best style of English literature, but that's not why I chose to read this book.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This was a Christmas present to an avid &#34;Firefly&#34; fan. It is a great completion to the &#34;Firefly&#34; TV series and ties everything together. It made me want to start watching the whole series from the beginning again. And there is nothing wrong with watching Nathan Fillion!
030758836X|5.0|Read this book but do not read any of the reviews.  It is not possible to review this book without including spoilers,<br />Pay attention to the ratings but read the reviews only after you have completed the book.
1419702238|5.0|who would have thought a grown man would understand the nature and thoughts of children. it was a pleasure to read and very funny. even though i brought these book for my nephew, i actually enjoyed it.
B007V65R54|5.0|I have only read about 40% of the book so far, but I am really enjoying it.  After spending 27 years in industry, for the last four years, I have been teaching statistics at the university level.  I am just getting into the Bayes vs Fisher discussion and am finding it fascinating.  Clearly, this book is likely to appeal more to someone with my background than someone who might spend less time with statistical questions and concerns, but I love that Mr. Silver is getting such great press for his book (even if it took his nearly perfect record in predicting election outcomes over the past two presidential election cycles to generate some acknowledgement of his work).  It used to be that a truly educated person only had to read and write, as well as maybe balance a check book, but with the avalanche of data and information in our world today, to be truly educated, a person needs to have some significant degree of statistical literacy.  Mr. Silver's book (so far) appears to be a positive step in the direction of helping everyone to improve their own statistical acumen.  So, thanks Mr. Silver, for your contribution, as well as the hours of enjoyment I am getting in reading it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The story line was awsome it kept you hook and you couldn't wait to start the next book
B0000VCZK2|2.0|Only the first one is really worth watching, and maybe the second.  The third we liked so little that we haven't even watched the 4th yet.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really enjoyed the three books. I was really sad when the series was done because I was left wanting for more.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Best American psychodrama of all time - the  eternal moral ambiguities contantly force to re-examine  ourselves and our culture.  A classic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was hooked after this book, I liked the story line and how it played out. I could not wait for the next book to begin
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I saw the movie previews, heard wonderful things from different people, so I got the book.<br /><br />I have put it down mulitple times and picked it back up thinking, \\"It has to start getting better by now right? I'm on Chapter 22.....  Chapter 28... Chapter 30... Chapter 33...\\" NO. I am losing my passion for reading because of this book. It's time I put it down and move on to the next..<br /><br />I read another person's review and I will quote,\\"There are so many other books worth your time.\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game its amazing and fun its a blast. to play and my kids love it keeps them entertain for hours.  we just love doing it
B000LB7G00|5.0|I have been doing CAD for some time now and was always frustrated by the pan/rotate/zoom button configuration on all of the different CAD systems.  Some required a middle button click to pan, others had a middle button click to rotate and it was always confusing.  This product takes all of those extra key strokes out of the equation and lets you focus on your work.  If you do even a little bit of CAD, this product will be of great assistance to you.  It has very little setup and a fairly steep learning curve.  The only problem I have been experiencing is that the soft touch rubber is beginning to peel off of the top of the product near the edge.  Other than that there have been no problems.
B008V4H6N6|5.0|Just wanted to throw down my 2 cents along with my 5 stars:  While I have all of Flylo's major releases, this is the first that has transcended into my inner circle of listening rotation. While Cosmogramma had it's moments, and Flylo's work on Thundercat's album was moving in the right direction (great album, really), this album surprises me and I can't get enough of it. It feels so coherent. Now, this is a completely subjective judgement, so take a listen before you buy, you might prefer the frenetic energy of earlier releases. That ain't here. What is here is intricately constrained energy folding back in on itself, not quite the quiet that the title is waiting for, but the right kind of quieter. Enjoy!
0345803493|3.0|This series honestly isn't really my cup of tea.  That said, I found this second installment much more satisfying to read than the first.  I really enjoyed seeing more of Christian's family and the couple's friends.  I also love the bodyguards and staff.  The best part of the book deals with Christian's crazy ex sub and Ana's perverted and possibly psychotic boss.  I found \\"Darker\\" to just have a stronger overall plotline.  I will never be a Christian fan.  I find him positively creepy and disturbing.  However I do feel for poor little boy Christian and all the trauma he had to endure. The more I read of these books, the easier it became to ignore the writing style and repetitive phrasing.  Honestly, I think the sex was the more boring part of this book.  I'd hoped for the hot stuff I'd heard about but I have read hotter scenes in my paranormal series.
B005LAIIQC|1.0|I loved the movie, so this is not a review of content, but form:  I've been trying for an hour to redeem the digital copy for Amazon Instant Video, and the Universal site absolutely is not working.  Disappointing, because I stream movies more often than not - use discs for extras.  Much prefer the physical digital copy we used to get in combo packs.
0062060562|4.0|Very interesting story, and hooks you in immediately. I think this is a book that a wide variety of people would like. I loaned it to my mother and she read it in a couple of days and liked it.
B0030B1WBM|4.0|My son really enjoyed the movie.  We don't want to give too much away about the plot but we think you will like it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This novel is about 400 pages long.  The first quarter was all over the place;  there were descriptions and side stories that were numerous and uninteresting, but taking all this information in leads to how the rest of the story plays out.  The next two hundred pages were excellent, I couldn't wait to get home and read this book!  The last hundred pages give some idea of how the story will end, which could be any way imaginable.  I feel that the ending was a disappointment.  In the credits section, Gillian Flynn credits her editor for encouraging her after she almost abandoned her project 82.6% of the way through... and that seems very believable--perhaps writer's block set in and she simply tried to get the book completed after this point.  The ending fell really, really flat.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|Suspenseful. Decent acting. Sad story of a vapid, materialistic culture that resembles ours. A bit heavy on violence. Not for young viewers.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I saw the video for Thrift Shop and got the mp3 of it. I loved it but didn't expect anything from the album and delayed listening to it for a few days. I decided to give it a shot and fell in love... not one song on the album is a filler or not amazing. Every song is beautifully written and produced, thought-provoking, motivational... I listened to it on repeat for 12 hours straight through while working and did not get bored. I still love every song, and even though I have a few favorites, I don't even have the heart to skip to those because the others are so good. What a pleasant surprise this album was! What's even more impressive is that it is independently written, recorded and produced. These guys are seriously talented and genuine. This is easily the best album I've heard in years.
B003F46RVO|5.0|This movie is so good and such a classic that it makes you want to be a vampire. I like that Michael even though he is a vampire will never attack his brother and will fight until he returns to normal. such a great movie.
B00A0SLTCU|3.0|But, I'll watch it again to see if I missed something.  Was good effects....<br />Maybe a tunnel running through the middle of the earth was a bit to<br />much, even for a sci-fi geek..
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I love John Grisham books, and although I have not had a chance to read more than a few pages, I am already intrigued and cannot wait to get to read the rest of the book.
0061124958|5.0|This is a clasic and my son when he was a little boy watch it on TV and became his favorite. It is very sensitive story about caring and I  love this book .Now that my son is an adult and married with kids I decided to get this book and give it for christmas to my grandkids. I also have the movie and I will give it to my grandkids but after reading the book.This is a beautiful story as I said before about friendship and caring.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Saw part of  this one on TV, and had to  get the movie! Helen Mirren is amazing and a delight to watch! Interesting interpretation of traditionally male role in this Shakespearean tale. Special effects clever, and occasionally jarring to me, but they all fit well into the whole. Well worth the price and worthy of your time!
1250006341|5.0|What an amazing show.  We are so anxious for season three.  this is a wonderful companion to learn more about the characters.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The book is well written and captivating...interesting style...I haven't finished it so I don't know if there's a twist, but since Andie showed up I'm sure there must be. And why did Amy want to buy a gun?<br />Seemed to lose steam about midstream...I was expecting a twist, but it just fizzled out...no redemption for the would be hero and the antagonist wins!!! I didn't even know It was over.......
B008ELUEQC|5.0|A very nice Christmas C.D.<br />There are a couple of songs new songs on it I really like.<br />Good purchase.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Well written,moodey, good syntax. Flawed protagonist...I liked and disliked her at the same time. I was floored by the ending. Interesting.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|Ok this movie is ok, its one of those I like to call mind F&^% movies that you have to keep watching in order to understand it. Some cute females play rolls but, the story just kinda was off a bit.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|Hey man, why are you down here reading a review of this?  If you are viewing this collection of star trek dvds than you know you already like them.  Just pick them up, these are great movies.
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's style has captivated my imagination ever since I read the books he co-authored with Robert Jordan (wheel of time series last three books).  This book is definitely in that category.
B009LRE040|1.0|strangest batman movie i ever watrched,i never even made it through the entire film,batman is rarely seen,and when he is he is a bumbling retard always in pain and getting beat up..isnt batman supposed to be doing the beating up?this movie is deranged,and kinda sick..it made me sick watching it..all i can think about is the $4 i wasted
B004GYY714|5.0|This app makes it easy to stream and tune anything you can imagine to a kindle or similar android device.  You can select from a wide array of things on the radio.  I selected some talk radio categories to stream.  You can select the program you want and stream from numerous locations.<br /><br />Great app for a multitude of programs.
B003SI84D6|5.0|gosh,i watched this movie over and over,all the great stars and thier acting was simply amazing,and this movie makes you feel like your actually in the old west..so realistic.the only movie that could slightly compare would be texas rangers.tombstone is worth watching!
B009VB97EY|4.0|It was okay.  Really did not need all the body movements to give the message, which was sweet about a brother and sister.
B000002KOQ|5.0|I ordered two by mistake, so someone will get thie Joni Mitchell cd for Christmas. For once, a good mistake (my fault). All arrived quickly and in brand new packaging. I am happy.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|This movie is great! The characters are getting older and the story is getting darker. It's pretty fast paced because they had to fit everything in from the book but i think it's great and glad i finally own it so i can have marathons whenever i want to.
B000002KOJ|5.0|I love Joni Mitchell, and had just gone to a Joni Mitchell tribute, and only had tapes, so it is wonderful to now have some Joni Mitchell cd's. Great sound quality and arrived in brand new packaging and all in a timely manner.
B00846REIS|4.0|Having just come out of the all encompassing world of Ana & Christian Grey, I was left feeling empty and looking for more. I definatly found it in \\"Bared to You\\". It was loaded with hot, sexy people having lots of hot sexy sex! The reason I gave it 4 star's instead of 5 is because it was a little bit too much of a bumpy ride. Too many up & down moments....one page everything is bright & sunny, then the next page one of them is running away. But regaurdless, its a great story, an easy read. I even found myself during the day, while out & about wondering what I would find when I could finally get home to read more. Its captivating, engaging & will leave you wanting more. If Christian Grey isn't available, then Gideon Cross will do just fine, thank you very much!
B0000C23DO|5.0|I have yet to listen to all the cds I ordered, but I have always loved the Grateful Dead. All in perfect order.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The story was pretty standard, with a few twists and an obvious darkness to the fairy tale side. It added an element of suspense to the whole ordeal. I watched this with my girlfriend and although she wanted to watch it badly, it seemed that her attention was not held. There is the action/horror/suspense element as I said, just not much of the love story side.<br />The visuals were pretty striking and seamless with the surroundings, not sticking out like cheap CGI effects. I didn't feel like the story developed well, as far as delving deeper into the why of this characters background, and actually understanding his/her deeper emotions and reasoning behind this sudden willing determination. (you'll understand what I mean if you watch it) I understand there is only so much time you can put into a movie, it just feels as if some of the characters who would seem to have a richer background and possibly more dynamic personality, fell flat at times.<br />On the action side, there is a good amount of it. It is by no means an &#34;action&#34; movie, but there is enough to hold your boyfriends/husbands/best friends interest.<br />Overall I would say if you have a couple bucks lying around and you haven't seen Hunger Games, or one of the other sci-fi/fantasy/fairy tale movies that are out on Amazon Video now, go ahead and check it out.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good story line,but his fighting sucks big time!! Quality of the movie was awesome,I will recommend this movie to a friend
B005D0RDKW|5.0|It is really impressive to see this guys perform live, they are incredible! Every single time I but I new DVD from them they sound even better. The setlist is great and the sound and image from the blu ray are really good.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Loved the detail and facts.  Well written and interesting.  Hard to put down.  Glad we finally received a non-political account of the events.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I have never seen other Vince Flynn books. But when I started reading this book, i simply could put it down!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|This sequel to the first Sherlock Holmes movie with Robert Downey, Jr. & Jude Law was fun. I really loved the slow-motion flashbacks that were used to explain some of the passages. Good action sequences, fantasy, but fun to watch.
B009KHDT0C|1.0|This item was included with an over-sized, non-DVD item that was forced in with the DVD in a DVD mailing carton... The end result is that the DVD case was pushed in and now it's unsuitable as a gift as I had originally intended.  WHoever packaged this did a piss-poor job and obviously didn't care about what they were doing.  As a fan of the origianl series and having seen the movie already, I liked the movie but my complaint is with the way it was sent.  It's not worth my having to pay for the return postage just to have anyther sent in its place.  You all usually do a great job, but you missed the boat on this one!!!
0316236535|5.0|My 3 yr old loves this book. Really simple and uses repetition, great for younger kids to understand. and teaches them not to be scared of monsters. She has the whole thing memorized.
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I loved this low key romance.  Kristen Scott Thomas is an actress that I don't love (even though she is really good)...but in this movie she was so funny!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I ordered it, it came, and it was correct. I worry about ordering movies sometimes b/c I've ordered blu-ray's and ended up getting DVD.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I've been waiting a long time for Aerosmith to come out with new material. I was not disappointed.<br />All the songs brought their own unique sound and feel to the album. If you are an Aerosmith fan, this is a must have.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I got hooked on Michael Connelly books after reading the Lincoln Lawyer.  I have now read every one of them and can honestly say there was not one that I didn't like
B003H9MSPG|2.0|I was thinking this would go farther than Retaliator but it is almost half the distance.  I wouldn't recommend it.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|I come right out and say it, I'm a lifelong skier and a horrible snowboarder. Regardless of this fact, The Art of Flight is a great film and really got me excited to hit the slopes. Every shot is beautiful and the soundtrack matches perfectly. The blu ray picture is incredible, it really brings the mountains to life. The audio is mixed masterfully as well, even on my very modest 3.1 setup, it sounded amazing. The opening in Alaska with the Nero Remix of &#34;Ghosts N Stuff&#34; playing was probably some of the best moments I've ever watched. Whether you are into boarding or not, I can not recommend watching this enough. You will not regret it.
B002SRQ214|5.0|I have built 4 systems in the past year and this one I had a motherboard and ram sitting up with no cpu.  Anyhow I had purchased the  new fx 6300 thinking it would be compatible since it was an AM3 board....it wasn't.  With that being said I decided to go with the older one, after install this thing runs really really fast for the money you spend.  I have another system with and I7 3770k, to tell you the truth anyone whose looking to save some money and wants a great rig for gaming and home pc function..this cpu is awesome!!!  I have 8gb of ram along with it and a regular seagate hd....I am very happy with it and  I know my little brother will be to...I also have an asus 7870 vga card ....!  great buy for the money, it would be a great buy if it was 150.00....
B005S9EJ14|5.0|On IMDB, I have rated over 250 movies. So far I've rated only 4 movies as 10/10. This was one of them. I will say no more.
0553381407|5.0|This book was very helpful to me.  I came from a dysfunctional family with judgemental overbearing father.  Book helped me to understand...why he acted that way.  Highly recommend.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great film. Watching in Blu-ray 3D, even greater. You can almost believe that the actors were riding creatures that fly.
B005M5PENG|5.0|I Love this show so very much! I watch them while on the treadmill. Keeps me on the treadmill until the end because I am so interested.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have an amazing album. It is great music for relaxing, soul searching, or practically any other type of activity to accompany their music! Buy it!
B005P89F1C|1.0|Before you jump up and buy this album, listen and I mean listen to the samples at least and compare it to any of his other songs and then think about whether I might be right in saying this album was just done to put out an album without much thought or practice behind what was produced.  I would skip on this endeavor completely as it is not up to snuff.  Seems like Justin Bieber is becoming too distracted to care about what is being produced and now just milking his name for as much time and money as he can. Producing something like this will hasten that down fall all the more quickly.
B0086213XW|5.0|This is a really wonderful film.  I was completely absorbed in the acting and the unfolding of the story.  Sarah Polley does an amazing job letting the actors shine and shooting a beautiful film.  A must watch for aspiring actors.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Mitch Albom has done it again. He has created a page turning story that not only melts the heart but makes you want to change how you live your life.
B0002KRTUW|1.0|If I could have rated a ZERO star I would have.  This doesn't work in the us, wrong zone.  Why can you sell it here!?!
B000ME5B30|5.0|I read the book and have seen this before. I purchased it for my mother who had been a climate skepticc until after Hurricane Sandy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|What a great book.  I could not put it down. And now I have to start the 3rd book so I can find out what happens!
B00499K9E0|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes (the original A.C.Doyle stories) and I've rarely seen a television program or movie that lives up to the original works.<br /><br />My favorite interpenetration of this character is the Jeremy Brett series, but I have to tell you...  This is an AMAZING modern interpretation that shows respect to both the original characters and the viewing audience.  I may have to own these.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|While you are waiting for the next George RR Martin, the next Patrick Rothfuss, or Jim Butcher, or Brent Weeks; read this.  All the other positive reviews are spot on.  I could say more about it, but I really just wanted to put in my over-all impressions of the book, not wax slobbery at gushing lengths about how enthralled I was by this book.  Because it got me good.  Sucked me in with a retelling that was smooth.  You know how some authors write their flashback stories in such a way that you want to whip through the past to find out what's happening NOW?  I have in the past spent whole books torn between parallel plots, worrying over one side of the timeline while trying to bull my way through the other, thereby missing details as I went.  This book does not do that.  The delivery is all about gentle teasers, followed by gritty, in-your-face recollections that kept me happily immersed.<br /><br />I could have felt more strongly for some of the characters.  I could have hated some more, or really cried over some of the others; but the narrative of the main character has a dispassionate flavor.  The tone sort of speaks to the mental distancing he's forced to adopt through the conditions of his life.  So it fits, and I liked it.  I like reading from the male perspective, because there is a distinct lack of mamby pamby.<br /><br />I just realized I'm waxing slobbery.  Sorry.  Anyway, if you like stories of epic fantasy, solid world-building, Man versus oppressive conditioning, heroes, self sacrifice, swords, sorcery...<br /><br />I'm telling all my friends about it.  It's cheap on the Kindle.  Read it. :)
B008RA3X5E|1.0|Revised rating - the app keeps crashing on my Samsung Galaxy 10.1\\" Note II (running Android 4.0x).<br /><br />If it weren't for this annoyance, I would have kept it, but there are many other \\"free\\" alarm/clock apps - go get one of those instead.
B001LF3YQK|4.0|I put this case in our car, hanging it from the headrest of the front seat, so that we can easily access wipes while on the go. The strap keeps the package out of the way and off the floor. It also means I'm not searching for wipes under the seat or buried in the glove compartment - they're always within easy reach.<br /><br />I like the hard plastic shell and appreciate that it's dishwasher safe. Like other reviewers, I have found the red button to be a bit temperamental, but I feel like I have the hang of it now. Also, I put a travel sized pouch of wipes into the case, keeping them in their plastic shell, to help maintain moisture.
B00633W614|3.0|&#34;The Sins of the Father&#34;  needed better editing.  Was rather difficult to follow all the players at times.  Would have been easier if I had read the earlier book.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|The book is well written as you can expect from Walter. The story is remarkable. Reminds me of the proverb - there is a touch of madness in every genius.<br /><br />I am halfway through it and am hooked on totally. Steve was clearly a man ahead of his time, but not by too much, which i think helped to build the success at Apple.<br /><br />Is promoting mediocrity a bad thing - looks like it....a fact that i always wonder when my kids receive great feedback from our school system for stuff which is not that great. Debatable, but again, you don't get to the next stage of evolution by taking it easy and not struggling.<br /><br />Must read book,
B00992CF6W|1.0|it Erastus all my stuff and I hats this game do not F this game I hade a building at Max higth
B004LWZWGA|5.0|this is one of the darkest super hero movies of all time and I have to say I loved it made me want to watch it again and again I really had a tear in my eye at some point durning the movie it is gripping, nail biting filled with drama action etc... this is a must if you love a nail biter.
B004GVUPFE|3.0|It's ok...kinda gets boring after a few rounds.  Move it is a good puzzle game to get your brain working.
0740745271|5.0|This has brought me more humor in the office than any email, fax, or joke ever could. I love watching others trying to &#34;see&#34; the pictures. The looks on their faces when it comes into focus is priceless!!!!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game playing is fun and easy very hard to put down once I pick it up to play. my kids love this game too
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I have not been able to get any of the free apts to work with my network printer on my Ubuntu server.. So far I don't like any of them..
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I downloaded this on my new Kindle Fire 4G hoping to be able to play Facebook games on the road.  No such luck.  It appears to be downloading the game, but then it stops: all you get is the logo of the game.  Very frustrating.
B008K6DU4Y|5.0|&#34;MXPLAYER&#34;, is a very good program.  If my tablet had a better buffer and wifi, then I could watch my movies off my server.
B009Q6ADG0|4.0|Worthy of being an official Bond song.  I don't rave about it as much as some others do, but it's definitely not bad.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|I bought this after hearing it was the number one selling cd last year. I wanted a nice Christmas cd for myself and to give as gifts. I bought one, listened to iT, then bought 2 more to give! It has so many familiar tunes and his voice is so smooth. He doesn't ruin your favorites by &#34;making them his own,&#34; if you know what I mean. Kind of does a copy of the drifters White Christmas, and I LOVE their version, but was also very fond of this one. Santa Baby by a guy? Yup, and it works just fine. You won't be disappointed by this cd. It is an excellent choice. Classy all the way!
B0043GN6XK|5.0|I have many Vivaldi opera CDs, which are all excellent, but this is possibly the best.  The music itself is great, but the sound quality and performances are outstanding.  I was puzzled at how some of the arias seemed identical to those used in other Vivaldi operas, but that's due to the composer's possible laziness, not the makers of this album.  Then again, Vivaldi was famous for recycling his themes.  He's still my favorite composer.
B006H3MIV8|3.0|Some songs were done well, most were not.  I would say 75% were poor remakes and would be very surprised if Bob Dylan liked this CD set.
B009FBX5M0|3.0|This soundtrack has some catchy numbers, but few if any real themes.  It's all pretty much electronic mood music that puts you in the &#34;Bondian&#34; frame of mind, but rarely if ever actually takes off.  I was relieved to find that David Arnold quit doing the Bond soundtracks.  He started off well in Tomorrow Never Dies, but quickly descended into trashy noise that had nothing to do with the spirit of Bond music inspired by John Barry.  Regarding Thomas Newman andd whether he's better than Arnold, as Sean Connery said in You Only Live Twice, &#34;Not better, just different.&#34;
B002JCSRKC|3.0|I thought these were just the cutest boots. I got them in navy and was really excited for them. I wore them as soon as it rained. They are very lightweight with a cushioned comfortable footbed, just like all the other crocs. Everything about them is perfect BUT, the ankles are very narrow. I have teeny tiny ankles so this was surprising. They rub the sides of ankle bones completely raw. I walk A LOT and I need my shoes comfortable. A half mile or so is fine, but when I went for a 2+ mile walk the other day I got home to bleeding ankles! Not fun. I bought these over Hunter boots because I thought they would be more comfortable, but because of the ankle issue I may have to get rid of them. They are also hard to walk up and down stairs in (mostly down). The tops have zero flexibility to them. However, they are very cute (lots of compliments) and it is nice to have a pair of rain boots that aren't exactly identical to every other woman in the northeast. Every time it rains here it's like a sea of olive green rubber.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I have recently been listening to a lot of P!nk's songs and I really love this CD! The third track, I Don't Believe You is one of her best songs ever. What a touching ballad! I must admit I'm not too crazy about the first track, So What and even the second one, Sober isn't too good, but the rest of the album is terrific! One Foot Wrong is another stand out track. Highly recommended!
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|If you or anyone in your household is a fan of dance this movie is a must see!The choreographing is off the chain!To say \\"they get wicked with it \\" is an understatement. Not to mention the soundtrack will make you wanna move. Highly recommended to anyone who's a dance and hip-hop fan.
B008CLI3TE|5.0|bought this blu ray becuase my girlf freind would watch it over and over on demand  but they only keep it for so long now that she has the blu ray thats all she watches.
0596009208|4.0|The book is easy and fast to read. Terms are easy to understand. With that being said i'm struggling with java. One thing i had to do with this book is totally memorize the code in early exercises to understand what i was doing. Good book your mileage may vary.
B001RHPJBU|4.0|it would get 5 stars except the first song is a bad recording with echos which annoys me. but the rest is great, phil collins rocks.
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|For all devotees of Rebus - he has not lost his edge - fast paced & quirky - do we have to wait a year for the sequel?
B009J2VR3Y|3.0|I love all of her work. The only the sound was not as good as usual and I play it on Bose.
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|How could Tom Cruise (5 foot nothing) be chosen to portray Reacher at 6 foot 5???<br />Reacher is larger than life in most respects.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is amazing and each song is well crafted. Glad that it was finally released for sale in the US.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Had my doubts at first. Thought the series was going to get boring after so many books. But was totally wrong after so many books still has me wanting more. Next book needs to come out ASAP
B000002573|5.0|One of my favorite bands of all time with &#34;More than a Feeling&#34;, &#34;Peace of Mind&#34;, and many more. I rank this band right up there with KISS and Led Zeppelin when it comes to 70's bands that really know how to work a guitar. FAMOUS rifts that any rock fan will easily recognize.
B003LAUBAK|5.0|This version has been improved from the original version. Sound is much improved and worth the $$$'s to buy again.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|for not expecting a camera on this device, I'm excited and pleased with what this app can do.  It's entertaining and I don't care that it costs a little... what's $2 more dollars for something I didn't think was possible?
B008LSVLVA|5.0|The quality and dimension of the sound and surround mix in the Blue Ray of the concert rivals Steven Wilson's original studio recording of Grace for Drowning. Plus you get the impeccable high-resolution video of the concert program to go with it. Can't miss with this one.
B0086449YA|5.0|we were waiting for it to come to iTunes.... forever! Finally went online since it was unavailable else where. He never disappoints and this is well worth the buy.
B00795P4EG|2.0|i did not care for this app, look for something better, dont bother downloading it.  I would not recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't want to give anything away... You just never know what will happen next.  When I can read a book in 3 days it get's my applause.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Story read very quickly and was great mind candy.  Made me think... hey, could it happen?  Seems this is WAY easier than the traditional falling in love scenario where more than half of the couples end up in divorce court.  So if you're looking for a fun, easy read to pass the time, this is a quirky good story.
B007FG9LIE|2.0|**THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS **<br /><br />Others have given a good synopsis of this book, so I'm not going to.  The writing is fine and it was a pleasure to read a book that had been properly edited when it came to grammar, sentence structure, etc.  However, although I love a good mystery/thriller/sci-fi, I didn't love this book.  I was left with far too many unanswered questions and answers the reader was given were just unbelievable (WARNING: ** SPOILERS AHEAD **):<br /><br />-- Seriously, the main character has to run around the town naked, not once but twice?  And for what seemed like 1/3 of the book?  That was just an unbelievable scenario.  In addition, he's severely wounded, running all over town, makes it across a fast flowing river despite the bitterly cold water, only gets kind of stiff from wet clothes and very cold nighttime temps, and climbs the cliffs with a deep abdominal wound.  It was pretty hard to swallow his nearly super human athleticism.<br /><br />-- Why were \\"nurse\\" Pam and the sheriff allowed to be so cruel -- especially when so much effort was being put into an attempt to integrate the main character, and their cruelty was having the opposite effect?  It was later made clear everyone was constantly being watched, so it was known they were being nasty, even vicious, and they could've been stopped.<br /><br />-- There was no explanation how a lowly geneticist had the resources to secretly set up something like an entire town, hollow out huge cliffs with enormous caves that contain resources and materials to last for generations, and the technology to put hundreds of people into suspended animation and bring them back to populate the town 1,800+ years after they were put under.  And where was HE for 1,800 yrs?  Who \\"woke up\\" him and the workers who then \\"woke up\\" everyone else?<br /><br />-- There were many workers trying to keep the town going.  Why could they know the truth but not the townspeople?  If the townspeople had a horrendouslyhigh suicide rate after being told the truth, wouldn't the workers have a similar problem?  And why did the workers live separately?  Why weren't the workers and townspeople integrated to work to survive together?  Almost no info or answers were given about the workers and that side of things.<br /><br />-- How could that amount of disintegration of humanity have happened to the world in 1,800+ years?  That's an extreme amount of evolutionary change in what's hardly a blip on the evolutionary scale -- certainly not enough time for what we're expected to believe happened.  (To put it in perspective, 1,800+ years ago in our world was a couple hundred years after the birth of Christ.)<br /><br />-- And the \\"fete\\" (I can't use the font here needed to spell that correctly) is also quite unbelievable.  I'd think that sort of blood-thirsty behavior would really worry those watching and controlling things, so why was that allowed by them?  Why did they let the killings be turned into a big party?  And why was the main character given answers and shown what the world had become in order to get his cooperation, but not the others who were killed.  You'd think in this situation every person was important.<br /><br />Those were just some of the many problems I had with the story.  It was OK, but it's not one I'll read again....
B003ES61EE|5.0|Works well as described, arrived on time was packed well and safe. It also fits in a outdoor vest or just your shirt pocket.
B0000X61VE|5.0|My daughter said this is one of the most awesome workout videos she has ever used!  She just loves it!
B004LWZWGK|3.0|Hard to follow. Way to much non-batman footage and seemed like the producers added footage just to make it longer.
B0028R3NCU|5.0|I like this instead of carrying around SD card Reader and Cards.  Plus my SD card reader don't fit correctly in recessed USB ports.
034580404X|5.0|Total value for money! Good way to start a book club! I have already recommended it. You will love it.
B004X4QW42|5.0|Enjoyed the rental so much went and purchased 1 & 2 a day later.  Dont hesitate to see this if you love martial arts
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of short books. They were well writen and original. I am currently ready the next book in the series. I highly recommend reading!
B005SFR7YE|5.0|like most of my purchases on Amazon this was a gift.  it was for my mom who loves the Phantom of the Opera.  the actors in it are really good the woman is just amazing.
B007HACDLK|3.0|It is a very good book but it seemed he rushed the end of the book.  Maybe I just did not like the end but after reading a good book the ending did not wrap up good
B004ADB17Y|5.0|like most children who grew up in the 80's I love the Goonies. Unlike most movies in the 80s The Goonies gets better over time .  my nieces and nephews have seen the movie at a young age so we will continue the magic 4 generations to come.  every time you watch The Goonies it's like a new adventure.  and how adorable is Sean Astin
B0043WDK2G|5.0|I love this show.  It make me smile when I watch it.  They always keep me guessing and I love the chemistry between Castle and Beckett!
1449415881|5.0|I bought this for my son in law wh says he gets it every year and puts it on his desk at work.  He enjoys it every year.
B0091THRCU|5.0|My phone fit well into the wallet as the wallet is made exactly to the size of the phone. The section for the card is very tight as well and I can only fit my drivers license into the slot.<br /><br />Worth the money spent.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Bought this cd having only heard Stronger and Mr. Know it All, and am pleasantly surprised that there is not one song that I do not like. My personal standouts are Dark Side, You Love Me, and I Forgive You. I'm still in the honeymoon phase, so it goes with me in the car, and back into the house at the end of the day.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Pretty good detail, gripping, couldn't put it down.  But read Fearless  -- Adam Brown's story as well. That's my kind of hero.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Good app if you like Majong. If you're looking to be really challenged, this is not the app for you. If you're looking to waste some time, this is a decent way to do it. No real bells or whistles, but the graphics are nice. There are free options out there that are more entertaining with more boards.
1455527475|5.0|This book was recommended to me by some friends. Before I read it I saw some of the negative reviews and was a little tentative about reading it. I am glad I decided get the book - it was an excellent. As a graduate of a top ten MBA program which sends the majority of it's grads to Goldman and McKinsey I can totally relate to what Mr. Smith is saying. I have often been dismayed by the some of the folks in finance who have no qualms fleecing their clients - especially totally ignorant ones as if they deserve it because they don't know any better. If I were a leader at Goldman I would thank Mr. Smith for sounding the alarm and forcing Goldman to reflect on its culture. As to the negative reviews here, especially the ones that are insulting it is clear they have no idea what Smith is trying to say - I am sure they'd steal the gold fillings out of their grandmother's teeth to make a buck. I highly recommend this book and completely agree with what Smith is trying to say.
B0086221SS|1.0|Soooooo sloooooooooww. Not as cerebral as the director thinks it is. Very boring and lacks interesting dialogue and interaction. I do not recommend
1451695195|5.0|I was surprised to read the negative reviews because I bought It and read it in one day. I was so impressed I sent three copies of the book to my aging father, scientist uncle, and a professor friend.<br /><br />The book is an impressive story and I realize how hard it is to write from the human standpoint...but due to his own skeptic and scientific background, I felt he was very credible. There is a great interview of him with Oprah and just seeing him speak after reading this book I felt it was true. I highly recommend this book.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Mis has to be one of the greatest, if not the greatest, musicals produced in America in the 20th century and this video recording of the 25th anniversary celebration is a great way to relive that experience. The music is fantastic, with virtually every other number being a show stopper. The anniversary is a concert version of the original production. Those who have not seen the show and who are unfamiliar with the story may have trouble following the plot, but can still enjoy the music. The singers are among the best who have played the various roles, the orchestra is excellent, while the lighting and other effects brilliantly add drama to the entire production.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Great story whose characters stay with you long after you have finished the book.  I found myself trying to read \\"just one more chapter\\" before having to put it down.  The author did a great job in making the characters come alive and allowing the reader to get to know them.  My only complaint was that at times I wanted the story to speed up a bit and there were a few times where I didn't quite understand what was happening and would have to guess- but maybe that is part of why it was so good.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|The gameplay is good.  At the higher levels you find yourself re-strategizing as they through unexpected challenges into the mix.  I've had it for a few months &amp; still not bored.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|It took me a while before I finally read this trilogy simply because the idea of kids being forced to kill other kids is distastful and hard to stomach.  I find it hard to believe that we are allowing and even hyping this story to kids and teens.<br />Suzanne Collins is a great story teller in that her writing is easy to read and the story flows very well...except in the third book where you find yourself wondering if someone else wrote it.  The story line takes very strange turns and the final chapters are more summaries than story.  All in all- an okay story with a difficult topic.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|For someone looking for action would not like this movie.  Its the kind of sweet movie I like watching on a cold day curled on up on the couch.  I love both actors and enjoyed watching them together.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is an outstanding show.  Damien Lewis and Claire Danes certainly earned their awards for this show.  I've watched five shows from the first season and I'm hooked.....
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Eyeopening book of the day to day lifes of SEAL Team 6 members.  The book is focused on the training and mission of killing BIn Laden but does go into the day to day life of SEALS. The book is hard to put down.  Great read.
B0093X805W|5.0|I have always loved this book and it was a special joy being able to share it with my daughter in its Kindle version!
B000056VJ7|5.0|I originally had this album on vynil when it first came out. I finally got around to buying the cd and the quality is much better! This is the original recipe for Meat Loaf - never better!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it works just like as expected from a simple calculator, with one extra and great bonus :the history tab. thanks for keeping it free!
0783230079|5.0|This is a favorite family movie. Even after all these years, those I give it to are amused and touched by this fun film.
B002Q1YDLI|5.0|What a wonderful conclusion to Darcy, Rachel, Ethan and Dex's story. Absolutely loved it!!! I hope they make this into a movie as well.
B001M0K52U|1.0|The book as pictured is the one I wanted. It was my son's favorite book in 1978-1930. But, when it arrived (at a premium price) it was only the small Golden Book size. Unfortunately this is a book that needs the large rectangular format. The words and graphics are large. So despite the one I received being an original for that time frame, it was NOT as pictured and it was not the large format. It was too much trouble to send it back, so I stuck it on a back shelf. (I later found a reprint in the original large size with a DVD and for only $10.)
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This app only loads the first few news feeds.  It is not even with using until it is fixe d
B003Y3ZTGA|4.0|I bought this for my younger brother, and the other day I listened to it and the CD was way better than I expected! Really catchy, I love the song Circle the Drain, it has a little bit of a dark edge to it. All her radio hits are solid as well, Katy Perry surprisingly didn't disappoint!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This keeps me occupied when I am bored. It is very fin and you can pick from a variety of puzzles. I highly suggest you get this app.
B007FQDPL8|5.0|I have waited for this bluray to go down in price for a long time now, and finally on Black Friday it was $25! I love the first and second seasons of True Blood, and because I don't have HBO, I'm not able to watch it whenever I please. So excited that I got the first season now! Can't wait to get the second!
B0086700CM|5.0|its good for the app store and it is very very fun cause like the more points you get the more people and wings you can get and it is just like a really really really really really really fun and cool game.
B004PVKFR8|3.0|After the first few listens, this CD gets really old fast. The songs are all very catchy, but I don't listen to it as often as I thought I would. Still a good buy at $5.
B000UZNRS2|4.0|I liked this one....I usually like the Camel Club books, and this one had lots of twists and turns so held my interest.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|I bought this the first day it came out, and Amazon had it for a remarkable deal of 99 cents! Of course I bought it for that price, but honestly I would have paid more. This CD is solid! Lady Gaga is a fabulous pop artist.
B004LROUNG|4.0|He's BACK!  I liked this book at lot, and liked that Grisham was once again at the top of his writing game...good read!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|This band is really hit or miss with this CD. While some songs like Radioactive, Amsterdam, and Demons are excellent, others like Top of the World are not to my taste. That being said, I don't regret buying this CD for the steal of $3.99!
B003UBTX7C|3.0|I found it tedious....not sure why, but I think it was kind of all over the place.  I love Baldacci, and this was not up to his usual standard for me.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I couldn't resist getting this for $10. I'm not a fan of Tom Cruz, but I am a fan of this movie. Perfect mindless action film that keeps you going. I loved it! One of my favorite movies from last year!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I thought this was Badacci at his best....great plot, good characters, and interesting to read.  I liked the characters very much!
B005LUJWBM|5.0|David Baldacci is the ultimate mystery/action writer. This books proves yet again that he has one twisted mind but to the benefit of the reader. This book kept me guessing throughout the entire novel and not one part was predictable. Love your crime but sick of the same story lines? This book is for you!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|There isn't much in here that you couldn't gather from the press reports, but here it is assembled clearly, without hyperbole and  political spin.  It's a very matter-of-fact accounting of the preparation of the men and the execution of the mission.
B008BM9L72|5.0|I'm one of those people who sees all the hype and thinks &#34;puhleeaze&#34;.. but I bit the bullet with this trilogy and I'm damned glad I did! While definately not real-life associated, its not meant to be either. This book was written as &#34;mummy-porn&#34; and it serves its purpose. Whilst the sex scenes are very frequent (it makes you think that anal beads are as common as brushing your teeth) it is suprisingly well written in the storyline as a whole. There are parts of this series that had me in stitches with laughter as the relationship develops between the two characters. This series is worth the hype!
B003274QH6|5.0|I was recently introduced to this show by a friend. Had seen it advertised before but had never watched it. Now I have a hard time stopping from watching and even rewatching it. Acting is great. Very mature subject matter and language.<br />Really happy with this buy. Seller was great (and prompt).
B003U8BTCW|5.0|Really nice work, illustrates the strangeness of life as seen through teenage eyes and ends on a positive note after all.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Program worked fine until this latest update... now it force closes every time I try to open it.  Sometimes it just locks up and won't even force close, so I have to pop the battery to restart the phone.  This was an epic fail of an update, and of course, now I can't go back to the original Kindle that I had that worked fine.  I have uninstalled this from my phone and am very disappointed as I loved reading on the droid.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Of course his books always teach you many more things beyond what the title says. You will learn how to cook great food while you learn to problem solve your life. Must have
B004SBULWE|5.0|I love it , it always works well and it is easily to check off the &quot;things&quot; and its always easy to use.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the tonal quality of a natural voice and no electronic tricks. Not as good as Bing Crosby or Nat King Cole, but the best of the current performers. I would highly recommend this CD.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its ok but you cant make things that you can make on the computer version but its still fun to play.
B007EE564U|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone interested in stories about espionage.  I've enjoyed all of Vince Flynn's novels as much as this one.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I thought this movie was so thrilling. I love how these movies build up and then chaos takes over and just when you lost all hope the Dark Knight rises to the occasion. There's an unexpected twist that you don't see coming towards the end.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I'm new to ThePianoGuys...but have found myself hopelessly addicted.  They're taking it to a whole new level.  They're adding a new twist to the classics, and have absolutely amazing talent!!
B000M9BPEY|5.0|Nearly solid story. Great acting and vision brought to life. Tim Burton gets real with Big Fish. It's a great modern day fairy tale of sorts that everyone can enjoy. Pacing is meh.
0345522478|4.0|Atticus is a druid living in modern day Arizona who has angered the Celtic love god and been chased by him for centuries.  Hounded is a must read for people who like urban fantasy.  Forget your previous ideas about druids; they aren't old guys with long beards and robes content to sit and chant at people.  No, Atticus is a druid who is ready to kick some major butt.<br /><br />Unlike Atticus who has adapted to modern times, most of the other Celtic personalities are stuck in the medieval ages.  It's hilarious to watch these \\"gods\\" interact with modern amenities and try to understand modern day values.  Full of magic, wit and charm this is a page turner that you will enjoy.
B007ATNHLI|5.0|Men In Black is a classic sci-fi film. To me, it's still a standout film, especially when you consider the string of other heavy-hitting sci-fi's that came out around the same time. Now that I'm older, I can appreciate the sensitive parts of the story more, and I find that the humor is still balanced out to a T. The picture quality is outstanding considering the age of the movie. Audio was pretty nice from what I could tell as well. While I don't plan on picking up either of the unsuccessful sequels, I will treasure the first, the best, the only...
B00005QEO1|4.0|very cool music. 1 of my  favorite bands. i used to have this on a tape. i really like this cd
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|I grabbed it for cheap from Amazon. I started watching Raiders of the Lost Ark today, and I couldn't help but grin as I experienced the true wonder of Steven Spielberg's vision as I'm sure he intended it to be seen. If you have doubted a blu-ray purchase will worth your money, there is nothing to worry about. This experience almost makes any other time you spent watching these films feel like a blur compared to the mastery here.
B008Y1YK9Y|4.0|i saw this in theatres. it was a good movie. a little confusing with the TIME TRAVEL story.<br />but it was still good
B0035WTJFW|5.0|The story here is as gripping as every earth based sci-fi needs to be to maintain an audience again and again. Grounded in reality, Spielberg masterfully brings to life an undeniably stunning vision. And, it's even better on blu-ray. I can't speak for the special features, but it's a film with a strong message, which makes it all the more interesting to watch. It will remain in my top five sci-fi films of all times for all time.
B004LWZWGA|4.0|i got this today. it looks very good. i seen clips on youtube. i got all the other batman movies
B007HGPBRC|5.0|Although his last book just prior to his demise, I think it may have been one of his best works. His words throughout each chaper led one to know the feelings and emotions of an optimistic but realistic man recognizing his final months and moments.
B004V5A7K8|2.0|Did not care for this game. I thought it was something different and did not hold my interest very long. Would not tell my friends about this one even tho I got it for free.
B0041KVW2K|5.0|There is really nothing to dislike about this boxed set.  The sound is second only to the MFS half-speed masters and if you could find a box of those anywhere, buy them!  I bought a box for a friends of mine and every time he puts another LP on his turntable he calls to thank me  The packaging is well done and the book is an excellent touch.  Well worth the price for anyone who either remembers February 9, 1964 or wishes they did.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|All of the expected mishaps for a Lampoon movie, this movie is hilarious! We watch it every Christmas and a few times throughout the year!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great game for strategy, good loading time and beautiful look. My kind of game t o  p l a y .
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I liked the book.  Good story.  Not suspenseful but good plot.  Solid read and good characters. Would be a good movie
B009NQKPUW|2.0|What happened to acting?  Talent has been replaced by blood, gore and special effects.  I had more fun with my Etch A Sketch when I was a child.
B0000AK7A8|5.0|very good the product has good quality and it is as described, it is a good product and i recomend it
B009JBZH54|5.0|Comes with a great book with lots of photos! I am very please with this product and am very glad I purchased this ahead of time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I'm afraid this trilogy has spoiled me.  Am now looking for similar stories.  Although I'm not into the BDSM and I never thought Ana would either but with a rich hunk like him spoiling you all the time, what's a little bit of being tied up going to do to you?Great ending.  Hope James soon tells us Christian's side of the story.
B009K45Y62|5.0|Comes with a great mini bat cowl replica! I am very please with this product and am very glad I purchased this ahead of time.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It was a comforting book to read.  Made me have hope that there possibly is a better place we go to and that I may see my sister again.  I know there are many sceptics out there, but it helped me get through a very hard time in my life and I have chosen to believe Mr. Alexander and his experience.  If you are going through a hard time like I have been, you should read this book.
B007XIC1GI|4.0|Very interesting and good read.  Very well written . And entertaining.  I'm too lazy to do a review but wanted to give some stars.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|This movie is a &#34;must see&#34; for any fan of science fiction. There are certain stories that become cultural icons, and &#34;Forbidden Planet&#34; is one of them.<br /><br />The basic story is covered in numerous other reviews and I recommend you read those. I bought this DVD because the other reviewers said this DVD copy has vibrant colors and is well made. I have to agree with them!<br /><br />Go ahead and buy this movie, fire up the popcorn machine, and spin the wayback machine to the 1950's. It's a kick.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|everyone dies and mutant zombie hybrids take over until a super slow big alien race creates war and the battle goes on for another 5 seasons.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|Though not quite as good as \\"The Dark Knight\\", this was a very satisfying Batman movie and a great way to end the trilogy.<br /><br />That's not to say there weren't a few issues.<br />1. Why didn't Batman use any of his gadgets in his fight against Bane.<br />2. The pit hardly seemed like hell on earth. The prison from the fist movie seemed a worse one.<br />3. The clock on the time bomb. Why do movies always like to put the timer on a bomb at an unrealisticly low counter. (An hour to go after the final confrontation with Bane would have been much more believable than 10 minutes.)<br /><br />BTW, Anne Hathaway is great as Catwoman (though she never goes by that name in the movie) bringing up memories of actress Julie Newmar's Catwoman.
B008MEM24S|5.0|Was fun for the whole family. Wish there were more boards. Can`t wait for the next update. Recommended for everyone.
0446581356|5.0|I got this for my girlfriend and she loved it. This is a great book i guess because she learned a lot from it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I heard about the Piano Guys from one of my cousins who also likes them. I listened to their music that was currently on Youtube and now I am hooked! I love how they take a clasical twist to new songs or give a new twist to clasical songs! These guys rock and I say if you like music without words and love the sound of a cello or piano or both together, you will like these guys!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This is a wonderful movie and one of the best climaxes I have ever seen in a movie. There is a similar TV series which I like called The Prison Break.
B0014I4KH6|2.0|the cd came ok but the case was broken and scraped up :( i was going to give it as a gift so i had to go out a buy a cheap case for it.
1401235417|5.0|I'll start off by saying that this storyline is up there with The Dark Knight Returns and The Long Halloween. I had been waiting to read this for over a year now, and since I'm usually one to wait for the tpb editions to come out to read the comics of my choice, I did that with this one as well, and now I'm mad at myself for waiting so long. Scott Snyder's writing is truly excellent; he knows how to develop a complex storyline all the while getting into great character development. Batman's character in this storyline is one of my favorites of all time; it really rivals the complexity of Miller's Batman in TDKR. Greg Capullo's writing only enhances the storyline. The art is excellent and it only further immerses the reader in the story. This book makes me question my stance on The Black Mirror, as I didn't like it my first time around. Snyder is probably the best comic writer around today. I recommend this book not only to Batman fans or comic fans, I'd recommend this book to anyone. Seriously, buy it now. When you finish reading, I guarantee you'll want to run to the comic store and buy all the recent Batman issues from 8 on. It's that good.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game! I have had a lot of fun playing it. I play it more than any other game on my phone .

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a good game. It is very addictive and a fun game to play. I play this game every day.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very excellent HO game. Hope there is a sequel to come. The clown and general setting was pretty creepy. only thing is, wish it was longer.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|It is understandable that there is a difference of opinion about THE BOURNE LEGACY, but comparing it to the original three Jason Bourne movies is unfair.  This is a `legacy' left by the environment in which Jas Bourne was hatched an as such, for this reviewer, it works very well.  The film is beautifully shot in superb cinematography, has a series of tight incidents that demand explanation but which get little due to the fact that this is a spy film about the various intelligence agency and occult secret scientific projects that are always in progress in every country. It is an expansion of the universe from Robert Ludlum's novels, centered on a new hero whose stakes have been triggered by the events of the previous three films.<br /><br />As someone distilled the plot, `this film deals with the fall out of the exposure of \\"Operation Blackbriar\\" and how an another agency with in the government is trying to cover up their program in order not to be caught up with the coming scandal create by Jason Bourne. \\"Outcome\\", the program in question is an offshoot of both \\"Treadstone\\" and \\"Blackbriar\\" but with a huge difference, they are tabbing into science to create super agents that are faster and stronger than any other agent before them.'  <br /><br />Suffice it to say that the new cast handles this very obtuse plot with a high degree of fine acting.  Jeremy Renner is excellent, always reminding us of his humanity while he flies around in incredibly impossible flight situations.  The extraordinary Rachel Weisz brings a complex role into the realm of credibility. The solid support cast includes the always excellent Edward Norton, Scott Glenn, Stacy Keach, Albert Finney, Oscar Isaac, David Strathairn, and Joan Allen just to keep the balance form the previous Bourne films in place.<br /><br />The speed of the action, the poundingly purposeful musical score and the non-stop fascinating twists and turns make this a top-notch film.  It does carry on the `legacy' of Ludlum's ideas, but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. Grady Harp, December 12deas, but manages to hold its own without too much replay of the originals. Grady Harp, December 12
B002L5GQGY|5.0|I love Jeo Bonamassa's music. This CD was new and the priced reasonable. It arrived quickly. I will do business with the vendor again.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This story was so heart wrenching. I loved it. It has twists and turns that make it hard to put down!
B00428CPUY|5.0|I love Eric Clapton's Guitar Festival of music. This CD was new and the priced reasonable. It arrived quickly. I will do business with the vendor again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wow! I loved reading this. Well written, fast-paced, smart, believable, and most of all, entertaining. I don't know what I could add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers. The author says there will be sequels. So if you're the author and reading this, hurry up! (please) I HATE having to wait to find out what's going on in ... oh wait, can't say that without spoiling!
B001XJEKGC|5.0|I love Eric Clapton and Steve Winwood's music. This CD was new and the priced reasonable. It arrived quickly. I will do business with the vendor again.
B005K01VZS|4.0|Wow!!! That is all I can say. I was surprised that I enjoyed the book. I wanted to read it because I love Mich Albom as a writer, but was torn because I am very ANTI- Religion. After I finally started it and got into the book it was amazing and well written as I expected from Mitch Albom. Even made me cry a little towards the end.
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Well if you are into the 80s glam metal secen, then this is for you..If you need to kill a few hours then this is one of those movies..
B004J64QR4|4.0|I Love Les Mis since I sang it in Jr High. What a wonderful musical. I love Alfie Boe as Jean Valjean, Lea Salonga as Fantine, Samantha Barks as Eponine. Little Jonas Brother got lost standing next to anybody, and you couldn't hear him unless he was soloing. This is my favorite roll for Ramin Karimloo as Enjolras, it really shows him at his best I feel.<br />You can't compare the 10th and 25th Anniversary Cast as they all made it there own. Growing up with the Dream Cast from the 10th I have to say I now watch and listen to the 25th Anniversary more.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The Walking Dead is the best show on TV! The writing  is so well done and the acting is simply amazing!! It's like rideing a roller coaster!  It has evolved from being a stroy about zombies to a story of how the human spirit can endure. What is possiable when you are faced with absolute extention? Anything!
B0071MQBX0|3.0|Wasn't my favorite cast. I don't feel that Ramin Karimloo is fit to play the Phantom. It's just not suiting for him. I do not like Sirra Boggess as Christine at all. She is not able to hit all the notes and she forces a lot of them that are out of her range. Hadley Fraser as Raoul and Liz Robertson as Madam Giry just weren't doing it for me either.<br />I would of given it 1 star for the cast and 5 for the musical ... thus making the 3 stars it stand at now =/
B001AGXEAG|5.0|As an avid Tim Burton fan, I just had to have one of his gems on DVD!! I am very pleased with this product and it was delivered in 2 days!!!
B008CP93S0|4.0|The movie was hysterical. It got weird toward the end but that's no reason to not see this movie. I would recommend to see it.
B00AE2I4WK|5.0|Ok so you can't beat the first Footloose but this is by far the best dance movie of the step up series. It's a movie all on its own, does not compare to the others. So imaginitive!
0545265355|5.0|i have never in all my life read a series before and this was the best experience i have EVER had....all those who rated this book below 5 star....your life is obviously missing creativity and fun....if u ignore the pricetag and the missing pages...its an excellent series you can really enjoy..i didnt even buy the series.. i read the whole thing for free as a pdf file which i downloaded...all pages...I LOVE THE HUNGER GAMES...i highly applaud you Suzanne Collins...i watched the movie also and cant wait for the other 2 to come out...books are WAY better though ALWAYS...more descriptive and i can literally watch everything happening step by step....but now my life is empty...i lived within the hunger games and now that its over...life can finally..begin..for them...but as for me...it ends<br /><br />-Abbi
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Traditional Scarpetta novel, well researched facts; for me it lacked some of the back stories between the characters I am so enthralled with!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Best game ever!!! in the words of pinkie pie. good story line and graphics. I cant praise this game enough.
B004PVKFR8|5.0|I was hooked on kill your heroes, then sail blew me away but the rest of the songs are just a great mix that I assure you, you will not be disappointed!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are an amazing group. They really put in the time and effort to make their music unique and special. Many of their songs are covers for other pieces of famous music with their own twist of creativity. This is most certainly music that I will be sharing with family and friends.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Pretty good app. I'm a cyclist so I follow the weather pretty close and you can never have to much information when on two wheels. Was planning to get the paid app til I read the reviews but now I think I'll wait this one out.
B008M0NDOK|4.0|The Duo Gamer controller for the iPad finally brings what all hardcore gamers have wanted for the iPad, a real controller. There are very few positives for this controller other than the fact that it works. But I think in actuality that's all you really need from a controller for the iPad, to work. It's initial price point of $80 verged on the edge of lunacy. I think the makers realized that finally and reduced the price to a reasonable $40. Still no bargain, but a must have for any serious mobile gamer.<br /><br />Pros:<br />+Very responsive<br />+Good color scheme<br />+Familiar button layout<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Absolutely no ergonomics, just a brick with buttons and joysticks<br />-Limited to a select few Gameloft games<br />-Joy sticks are very stiff and somewhat unsual<br /><br />Overall:<br />I'm a huge FPS fan, and a very hardcore console player. Maybe my addiction has taken a bit too strong of a hold when I feel the absurd need that I need to shoot 3D enemies even when I'm not at home. The touchscreen is plain awful for any sort of game that requires two joysticks like an FPS. I in fact refused to play any after buying GTA3 and being so frustrated at attempting to aim at anything. (Killing hookers and running over innocent pedistrians was good enough for me)<br /><br />This controller is ground breaking. It's the only controller for any tablet to provide support for FPS, racing, and MMORPG games. But I say that as loosely as possible.<br /><br />This controller provides support solely for the few Gameloft games listed above. But don't get me wrong, you are talking about 5 of the greatest games currently available for download on the App Store. Asphalt 7 is a very fun and addicting arcade style racing game. Order & Chaos is the first mmorpg produced for the iPad. And of course the other 3 games are FPS games that are amazing in their own right.<br /><br />But I still can't get over the fact I can't use the controller for all the other games this controllerwould make so much more fun to play (i.e. GTA3). Even the new Modern Combat 4 doesn't use the Duo Gamer.... wait what?! Yup, only Modern Combat 3 currently utilizes the Duo Gamer.<br /><br />The feel of the controller is another major issue. Any Xbox or PS3 player knows the feel of a controller is an art form. That it should fit right with a good size for your hands and a right amount of spacing between all the components.<br /><br />Art? Please! That's a load the makers didn't want to even think about. Put the neccesary buttons on a brick and be done with it. The edges are sharp and uncomfortable. The bottom isn't even flat for being a box, so laying it on a flat surface gives it this odd wobble. The joysticks are very stiff and are only joysticks in name and have no comparison to 360 or PS3 controller joysticks. There's a lot of empty space on the controller itself I feel take away from needed button enlargement. The triggers are not really triggers, just oversized buttons. Nothing on this controller is comfortable or quality. Well I shouldn't say that... I mean the blue light in the center is kinda cool, and the bluetooth connectivity isn't bad.<br /><br />Bottom Line: If you're ok with spending $40 on a controller to play only 5 games, get it and you won't be disappointed. Just know that going into this purchase you might be spending $40 to play with a controller on just 5 games...
0316067598|5.0|Marcus Luttrell's story is nothing short of a miracle. Even with all the training & skills he has, there had to be a greater Being looking out for him. This is a story of brotherhood, friendship, sacrifice, hard work &  dedication which culminated in survival.
B008VBYN80|3.0|The game is fun and addictive like many others but the energy needs to last longer! You can't hardly get half the necessary tasks completed and you have to quit or buy more gems:-(
0525953728|5.0|Mostly about the brotherhood, friendship, loyalty, dedication & sacrifices of the brave men who serve in the Special Forces of our military. Information about the training & hard work leading up to & including the killing of UBL. The real story you will NOT get from our government or the MSM news outlets. If you want to know the truth from someone that was actually there, get this book. You will be glad you did.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|If you haven't seen Mad Men, then you should.  Worth a try at such a low price.  Great show and worth the money.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The cover fit great and looked sleek. Really liked that it did not stick to clothes. However, sound was noticeably worse than with previous case. Voices often echoed or simply could not be heard by either person on the calls.
B000T433CO|5.0|Can't imagine Christmas without this movie!  It is very modern yet old in the theme of love.  Love is out there in the places in which you are not particularly in search of that special someone.  All the actors bring truth to their characters with their past,  hurt, hope and desire to find a life more fulfilling in their future.
B008KW43TE|4.0|Not something I would normally buy, but I love the difference of it.  Forest Gump has me right now :-) I am liking on Frank Ocean!
B002LFAHBO|5.0|As with &#34;The Holiday&#34; movie, this is modern with each characters'  stories touched with the old theme of finding love, peace and harmony in their lives.  Each story is creatively intertwined with one another.  Humorous, poignant, delightfully touching and sentimental.  There are a few scenes of brief nudity and adult situations, so maybe not for the whole family.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|Ordered for a Christmas present for son in law, so have actually not opened the CD yet.  It was packaged well and came in great condition.  It was exactly as described.  Thank you

0441013597|5.0|I almost gave this book four stars, because I felt there was something missing. I can't quite place why I feel that way.<br /><br />I gave it five, because I've rarely seen a fictional world more convincingly created. Everything works. The sheer imagination is inspiring. And there is profundity hidden in small passages. This may have been why I felt a nagging concern. Where other books would have hit you over the head with their brilliance, Dune is understated. When I fairly consider all the knowledge embedded in it, it's a true classic. The ecological understanding was ahead of it's time. I mean ecological in the fullest sense, as a system.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|I wanted to echo the comments made by others that this is a must for any sci-fi movie/halo fan.  Ir ranks right up there with the Neill Blomkamp short that was released over XBL a few years ago.<br /><br />Then main reason for my comments is that I wanted to clarify the Region coding for those who are asking.  I am in the UK but I have a manually switched multi-region BluRay player and can confirm that this disc only plays when set to Region A. I have only tested the disc on my player so there maybe some anomolies out there that contradict my experience.  But region coding was the one thing I was most interested in when I placed my order and there didn't seem to be any confirmation anywhere.<br /><br />So good news for multi-region owners and bad news for anyone who isn't American :(
B009YJEKJK|5.0|Seen the video from Ellen and my friends had me listen to there CD and I loved it.  Just had to have a copy for myself.  Great to hear the two of them singing together again.  It has been too long.

B007SGM084|1.0|Before presenting you with my scintillating review of the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy, allow me to present my credentials: I am a married female who has read more than five books in her lifetime. Most of the things that I read are written by professional authors, but I have also read and written quite a lot of fan fiction over the years. 50 Shades of Grey was originally brought into this world as Twilight fan fiction, so my experience with the \\"genre\\" will have some bearing on this review.<br /><br />*THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS*<br /><br />As fan fiction, the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy is acceptable. Fan fiction is normally written on a chapter by chapter basis, with the story growing in size and scope if the subject matter proves to be popular. There are sites devoted to these amateur stories, and the quality of writing varies from excellent to hideous, solely dependent on the skills of the particular amateur writer. The grammar and spelling in this story are passable; the plot is meandering and less than cohesive, but that is generally to be expected of stories that are essentially written on demand.<br />As a work of published fiction, the 50 Shades of Grey trilogy is a mess. The story takes place over a period of five months; however, due to the lack of plotting and haphazard addition of villains and conflict, it felt that the storyline dragged on for years. Nothing happens in the first book, other than lots of sex and relationship drama. The second and third books appear to be trying to make up for this lack of action by cramming in as many \\"cliffhangers\\" as possible. This works to a certain degree in fan fiction, which is generally published daily/weekly/monthly according to the writer's schedule. In a novel it falls flat, as it's harder to sustain tension when the plot point is going to be resolved with the turn of a few pages.<br />The narrative in the books doesn't flow well. This is as much the editors fault as it is the author's fault; the book shouldhave been cleaned up and re-written in many parts.  Words and phrases are overused to the point where I started counting the number of times that words and phrases like \\"inhaled sharply\\", \\"all the muscles below my waist/navel clenched\\" and \\"exploded/detonated\\" (the answer is, a lot). James pulls out the thesaurus in some passages, but most of the time she seems content to repeat the same words and phrases over and over ad-nauseum. Again, this can work in the fan fiction world, but in the world of professional writing this comes off as amateurish.<br /><br />For all that they are advertised as romance or erotica, the books contain surprisingly little of both. The sex is frequent, approximately every seven pages or so, but the frequency makes it frankly boring. There are only so many ways that you can the physical act of sex and orgasm, and James certainly doesn't dig out the thesaurus for these portions. There is always panting, gasping, lancing pleasure, circling fingers (it's always circles, endless circles), \\"you are so ready for me\\", detonating, exploding, splintering, emptying. It reads more like construction work than pleasurable activity. Perhaps if she'd toned down the number of instances and gone for quality over quantity? Who knows though, as that's certainly not what we go in the final edit.<br />I could forgive much of the above if the characters were interesting and vital. There are a few characters scattered here and there that are competent and somewhat compelling, Taylor for instance, but they are forced to the background so that our hero and heroine can spend over a thousand pages behaving like complete and utter wankers. I could devote an entire review to discussing exactly why I loathed both of them.<br /><br />Ana, or Anastasia, Steele is a character who desperately wants to be the heroine in a British novel (you are led to believe it's Tess of the D'ubervilles in the beginning, but I believe the author is trying much harder to ape Austen). At the age of twenty-one she has barely been kissed and never held a boys hand. She has also never masturbated, or been exposed to sex in any way, despite being, presumably, exposed to the internet during her high school and college career. She doesn't have a computer (despite being a college student), and is awed by getting an e-mail address, which she already has by virtue of being a college student. She swoons, very literally, over the hero.<br />After years of brushing off advances from attractive men, she figuratively throws herself at Christian Grey, because he is the only man that she has found worthy of her precious virginity. Within a day of meeting him, she drops all of her friends and family and centers her life around him. WITHIN DAYS. She bull-headed ignores every warning signal given off by Christian (we'll get to that later), and doggedly pursues a BDSM relationship with him, despite her misgivings about it.  She is an adult who has managed to graduate with a very respectable GPA, but she can't manage to remember to eat most of the time (or take birth control, despite having sex three times a day). There is never a time when she doesn't make excuses for her poor excuse for a boyfriend/husband, even when she knows that she is in the right.<br /><br />Christian Grey is rich and good looking, but he is also a sociopath. He stalks Ana from the first day that he meets her, finding out where she works and lives, what her cell phone number is, WHAT HER BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER IS (if you don't find this disturbing then I don't know what to say to you), what her social security number is, etc. He says that he does this with all of his \\"subs\\" (abuse victims), but that doesn't make it any less outrageously inappropriate. If he cannot control every situation down to the last, minute detail, he loses his shit and lashes out at the people around him. He manipulates people emotionally, physically and sexually, especially Ana. Human emotions beyond anger are completely beyondhim initially, though he does branch out into happy for very brief periods of time, and sad for great swathes of time.<br /><br />According to his psychologist, he is stuck adolescence, which is approximately the least appealing time in anyone's life, unless you enjoy dealing with temper tantrums and condescension on a regular basis. Although he makes 100k an hour (I cannot believe that this was published), Mr. Grey can't find a therapist decent enough to effectively help him deal with the problems stemming from his abusive childhood. An abusive childhood is a very sad thing, but it is not an excuse for acting like an utter douche for the rest of your life. Likewise, good looks and money are also no excuse for treating human beings like expendables. Christian does mellow very slightly by the end of the series, but there are still underpinnings of series control and psychological issues existing. \\"I want your world to begin and end with me,\\" he says, his expression raw. Seriously? This is appealing?<br /><br />The relationship of Ana and Christian consists of sex, fighting, more sex, a little bit of shallow conversation, sex, more fighting, occasional small insight into each others shallow character, even more sex, even more fighting, etc. When they are not in each others presence, they are sending each other long-winded e-mails that strive desperately to emulate the wit of Austen's epistolary novels. I grew to hate these e-mail exchanges, which would run on for pages and pages of each novel. Neither had any time to get work done in the midst of these insipid exchanges, yet no one lost their job (it helps when your stalker boyfriend owns the company, I guess). I wish that I could get paid 100k an hour (seriously?) to send e-mails to my stupid girlfriend.<br /><br />To cut this long-winded review short(er), there is no substance to these novels. I can understand escapist literature, and I have read quite a bit in my life, but I don't think it's unreasonable to have standards even for that. Nothing about the books could make me excuse the glaring flaws; not even the slight upturn in writing near the end (before the god-awful epilogue). It was too little, too late. As fan fiction, this would be a fine diversion. You don't pay for fan fiction. For $30, my standards go up considerably, and this didn't even come close to hitting them.
0385342039|3.0|Another enjoyable \\"chick flick\\" read by Sophie Kinsella, but not as good as \\"Remember Me?\\".  Young woman finds herself haunted by the ghost of her great aunt, who has a story to tell (centered around a special necklace).  I found that the story started to drag about a third of the way in ... for about 50 pages, then picked up again for a satisfying finish.  Engaging main characters, delightful humor, interesting storyline.
0767836324|5.0|Absolutely a classic movie and great for everyone of all ages! Dustin Hoffman plays a great role, Robin Williams and Julia Roberts are fantastic. Love this movie!!!!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|The book deserves 5 stars for literary quality and only 3 because of inaccuracies, therefore the rating of 4 stars.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|Need I say more? Harry Potter is a great set of movies, working on finishing my collection now. Watch them over and over again :)
B007JCP8FE|5.0|Very good album. I have had a great time with it and expect it will keep the blood pumping. I really like this band. It wasnt until recently that I was introduced to Shinedown but man after I was they have really grown on me. I had heard some if there more popular songs but it wasn't until I purchased their Somewhere in The Stratusphere and I heard more of their work that I really started enjoying the music. The lyrics if you listen to the words really hit me. Good stuff. This Album is just as good as any of their others.  Recommend!
B002KANXXE|2.0|I couldn't get into this book.  I kept trying but decided to just close it out.<br />I would not recommend this book.
B007HIEBV2|5.0|The music is good and it does not suck.<br />Listen to the samples first and find out for your self.
B002M89UMW|5.0|This movie is absolutely my most favorite movie to enjoy, especially during the Christmas season.<br />It just warms my heart and puts a big smile on my face.<br />I come from a rather large family with both brothers and sisters - all older than myself.<br />I enjoy this time period, both in architecture and dress of those times in history.<br />It's a great movie.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I loved the way he explained his name in the beginning - it showed such ingenuity.  Also loved his practical judgement about the zoo and zoo animals.  I think it got too full of fantasy when the island of growth happened.<br /><br />It seemed to me it stopped abruptly when he was finally interviewed, and he had to recover from such an ordeal. Since it was a fantasy it seems there could have been a more positive ending: someone with understanding to help him recover.
B0089OBLDO|3.0|I bought this for 2 purposes: so I could use my PS2 pad on PS3 as well as use my XBOX 360 Madcatz TE stick on PS3.<br /><br />The good news is that the PS2 pad works really well. I haven't noticed a single problem yet.<br /><br />The bad news is that my TE works but has problems. It seemed to be working fine at first with no detectable input lag. Then after about 5 minutes in training mode I noticed that sometimes my directional inputs (using the stick) didn't register at all. It happens infrequently but seems to occur at least once every 15 minutes. What's even worse is that sometimes when pressing right on the stick my character will get 'stuck' running to the right even after I take my hand off the stick and I have to press the opposite direction to get him to stop. Obviously, this is a problem if you intend to play in tournaments as a single missed block can cost you your life in fighting games.<br /><br />The stick's USB connector doesn't fit snugly into the adapter either, so it kind of hangs loose which makes the slightest movement disconnect the cord.<br /><br />For reference, I'm using an OEM original PS2 pad and the stick is a Madcatz Tournament Edition S, SSF4 edition. From what I've read on various forums this adapter prefers 'Brand Name' controllers, meaning products by Sony or Microsoft as opposed to Madcatz or Hori. I plan to test it with a few other sticks and I'll report my findings here in the future.<br /><br />**UPDATE: I tried the adapter with a generic Gamestop brand Xbox 360 Controller (actually made by Madcatz). It worked well aside from the analog seeming a bit over-sensitive. No dropped inputs or detectable lag.
B009B4ZEKM|2.0|I love Christina Aquilera; I think she has a fantastic voice, but this CD was a little too techno for me.  I did enjoy a couple of the songs, but most sounded like dance club music.
B00466HM28|5.0|I love this product. It is so much fun especially considering the price. I have a mac so it was pretty much plug and play experience for me. I never bothered with the software, so I'm not sure how good it is. I used it with Garage band. There is so much you can do with this, and like I said the price is awesome!
B00A77II0U|4.0|This game was easy and way too short but worth 2.99. I would recommend it especially if you like mystery hidden objects and puzzles. Good graphics too.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I liked most of the characters' honesty. The story doesn't tell any extraordinary event, but it's cool, funny. You feel like you're talking to the narrator. I'd like to watch the movie too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I didn't really know what to expect and am not sure if I understand why it ended the way it did.  Suzanne's imagination kept you in suspense till the final pages.  I won't spoil her ending and will just say,enjoy!
B007HACDLK|4.0|I love this series and felt that this book was one of the better ones in a while.  The ending may have been a bit anti-climactic but did not totally detract from the well written story.  Can't wait for the next one.
B006OFN0BQ|5.0|The music is stellar in this film. I was pleased to see DiCaprio and Hammer nominated for Golden Globe awards. Dench is always perfect. A dark film revealing the dark side of a manipulative, powerful man who despite his flaws  initiated important forensic elements, such as a central fingerprint base, and lifted the FBI to a prestigious bureau. Viewers need to be able to jump back and forth between the present and the past of Hoover's life.<br /><br />I agree with everyone else that the makeup artist who aged Hammer, in particular, should be shot.
B006UV8DJS|1.0|CRASHED ON MY VERY FIRST ATTEMPT TO SELECT AN INDIVIDUAL PHOTO TO EDIT. SAYS IT'S TRYING TO SHARE THE PHOTO (WITH WHAT?!). THEN THE APP<br />STOPS WORKING ALL TOGETHER! I WANT MY MONEY BACK! IF I COULD SUBMIT A REVIEW WITH ZERO STARS, I WOULD.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Any true Eminem fan will be very pleased when they listen to this CD. He is back with a vengeance this time, ready to reclaim his spot at the top of the Rap scene. For any of you who weren't thrilled with Relapse, which I actually liked as well, you'll be happy to hear Em returning back to his beat killing self. A must have.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I'm late coming to this series (late in terms of the fact it's been around for a while), but I'm definitely hooked.<br /><br />When I first heard of the concept, I remember thinking it didn't sound appropriate for younger readers, but the violence is dealt with incredibly well. It's not gratuitous or detailed and so I can see it would work well for a teen - as well as adults!<br /><br />I guess I loved everything about this book - the concept, the plot, the characters. It's a definite page turner (I finished it in a couple of days) and within about ten seconds of finishing book 1, book 2 was downloaded onto my Kindle.<br /><br />Would definitely recommend to both younger readers (13+) and adults, too.

B003M696QS|5.0|The book is a very thorough study done by a cardiologist.  He started as a sceptic, but believed it would be irresponsible to ignore the evidence.
B000ZN802W|5.0|Love this movie!  Eddie Vedder from Pearl Jam does the sound track and as a result the music is great too!  Fast shipping and good price!
B00005ATZT|4.0|Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones are great actors, and this has to be one of the best films of both their careers. The movie is awesome, and I never get tired of watching it.<br />The dvd itself was kind of disappointing. It's one of those paper-cover types, the ones that don't hold up very well in protecting the disc.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|My kids really enjoy this game. It really got them into pretend play of doctor and veterinarian. Its good introduction to multitasking and has some fun games in it.
0307346617|4.0|Can't wait till the movie. Not real sure how they will do that, seeing the book is collection if short stories.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Even my 4 and 5 year old enjoy this game, and it pleases me to no ends to see them figure it out! Also, being able to solve it perfectly is very rewarding. I think its excellent brain exercise :).
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Weeks great!  Got it paired with ultrasone hfi 580 cans and boy can you crank them up.  This thing also has a battery so you can take it Mobile if you want.....
B0030IIYYS|5.0|If you loved Toy Story, you'll love Toy Story 2!  The casting is phenomenal, the writing is hysterical and the animation is top notch.  Tom Hanks, Joan Cusack, Tim Allen and Kelsey Grammer, as well as the rest of the cast, are terrific!  A wonderful movie for all ages to enjoy on family movie night!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|I could watch this series over and over again! So wonderful! A must watch! The acting is superb and the costumes and scenery amazing!
B005LAIHY0|5.0|This movie was not what I expected. It was a great movie BUT it left me with too many questions. I hppe that the follow up closes out some loose ends.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I watched this movie 3 times in 1 night.  Great eye candy for us girls and some guys too.<br />I would highly recommend it and will watch it many more times in my life i'm sure.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|The Blue Ray edition is a million times better than the DVD. The quality of the disc and packaging was better than expected. Thank you!
B001IF252M|5.0|Work great I would recommend it to a friend, mother girl friend, and sister and brother and cousin!! You need this item!!
0061537969|5.0|This book took me by surprise and knocked me off of my feet! It is just an outstanding book. I now loom at my own dogs in a completely different light.Thanks!
0316228532|4.0|Fun read for the kids. began to get lenthy and boring towards the end. Still would reccomend the kids out there.
B00447G2PM|5.0|This is what your 3D car is made for! Great scenes in 3D that reach out into your living room. Interesting creatures and undersea plant life. This should be one of the first 3D films in your library as it will set the standard of what you should expect other 3D films live up to.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a wonderful CD! I love all of the songs. There is a nive variety, something for everyone! !
B0043RSE2M|5.0|You loved this movie in 3D in the theaters and may have seen it in 2D at home, but this 3D Bluray version for home is the way to watch it. Minions reach right out at you as do other effects -from subtle to in your face!!! Great story-line for all ages.
B007HO392S|5.0|As always, a great cd by this artist.  I bought this cd because of the song Tornado and am very pleased with my purchase.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|In the middle of reading this book as I write and can honestly say that this is one of John Grisham's best yet!  As usual, Mr. Grisham has woven a web of intrigue and has me wanting to keep reading to find out what will be the next twist.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm always looking for a good book to read. Absolutely loved this book! I would highly recommend this to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show (even though I can't watch it by myself).Im always on the edge of my seat and find my blood rushing through my body! I've even found myself a couple of feet from where I was because I was unconsciously backing away from the tv. I'm terrified if zombies but this show has the perfect balance of action, drama, romance, horror, and even some comedy thrown in, which makes the storyline so excellent even a zombie-phobe like me enjoys it. Season three does not disappoint and is just as good as the first and second season! Highly recommended!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Love this movie.  You will too.  Characters are wonderful.  Be careful if you ever eat chocolate pie.  It may surprise you.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|It was a good movie, but I didn't like how it had the Widescreen bars even though we had a Widescreen tv.
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved these books and hated for them to end, I wanted more! I found myself only sleeping 4 hours a day because I couldn't put it down. I love the characters and the romance behind all of the sex.  Oh Fifty!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Ordered this because my charger for my Kindle Fire started to go and not hold a charge. Once this came in it worked and charged my Kindle perfectly. Bought another one for my Kyocera Rise so it would have a longer cord so I can charge it from my bed!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great, fast-paced game with excellent graphics, especially for a free game!  I am continually impressed with the quality.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read of the 3 books. Really enjoyed it. Sad to loose so many  memorable characters. Satisfying ending of the series.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Great flick and nice way to complete the FireFly series.  Make sure you watch Fire Fly first.  This is a series that should have made it but didn't.
B005ZMTAXQ|5.0|Love the movie.., great for all ages ... Family loves it ... Recommend it to anybody .. Great great great!!!
B0019O6IWU|5.0|It is a good theory that leverages some \\"religious\\" concepts  without being a religious book itself (it focus on moral and ethic behavior). It is something to be called a practical (meaning - act upon) religion with no disciples or gurus. Good as food for thought for a religious person and good to be a religion replacement for atheists
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love these guys. Love how these use teamwork, love for music, and their enthusiasm to create the epic music of all times. I use their music to get through my college days and make me feel better when i'm sad. When the piano guys make music i feel pulled into it, feel it, relate to it and makes me feel like i am able to do anything. :D thank you piano guys for creating music of our times. PLEZ create more. :)
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. I couldn't stop reading and can't wait for the next book to come out in February. I read it in a matter of hours. Hooked on every word and envisioning everything that happened within the story.<br />I read chapters 1-5 a month ago and told myself I MUST get this book and in so glad I did. I recommend it to anyone who loves to read.<br />Even tho I'm not into the scifi as much as most. I couldn't help but love the cyborg, android, royals, Beijing and Lunar mix.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Christmas gift for my grand daughter. It's what she wanted. I know she will love it cause she loves the little Mermaid.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a friend, and he really enjoyed having all of the movies together! Great!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I agree this doctor was chosen to have this NDE because of his unique ability and position. I don't see how the existence of a heaven beyond can be explained away after this story. It has encouraged my faith and for me to seek more reading on how we can understand and communicate the reality Dr. A experienced.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The storyline to this film was not only dated and trite but was devoid of any true dramatic conflict.<br /><br />A documentary about the formation of the Chippendales would have been far more inspiring.
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|I suppose it would be easy to get fed up with Rebus, he can be a bit tiresome, but he's too old to change now and is a damned good detective. Good story, good plot, good interactions between chararacters. I give it five stars.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This is such a fun movie.  Action, humor, and a cause to root for.  We need more movies like this!
B0076DELIG|3.0|I am great fan of Michael Connelly, have been for many years, but Harry Bosch is starting to age. Well written, as ever, good suspense but to many coincidences.
B0086DBE62|5.0|My girls and I wanted something fun to watch and this totally fit the bill!  We laughed hysterically at several scenes.  Great family movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I loved THE BLACK BOX as I've loved all of the Harry Bosch series. I read most of them backwards but was able to keep the thread of Harry Bosch's life intact and find him to be a most intriguing character. Reading earlier novels last only enhanced what I learned from reading later novels first. However, BLACK BOX was just about 1 chapter too short. I would like Harry to have had some reflective moments describing what he had just endured and setting him up for his next adventure. But don't get me wrong, Michael Connelly has created another MUST READ police procedural thriller.
0553212443|5.0|Everyone at sometime should read this story.  Gets you in the mood for Christmas and being kind to others. Loved it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It is Vince Flynn's best book to date. I didn't want it to end. I always like Vince Flynn's work and can't wait until his next one comes out.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is my 2nd Piano Guys Album and 5th Jon Schmidt Album.  His ability to play the piano and Steve's abilities on the cello are a divine combination.  My 3rd grade students listen to this album every day for about an hour during independent work time.  They LOVE it and also strongly recommend you purchase it.  In fact it was on many of their wish lists for presents this holiday season. We all enjoy watching The Piano Guy videos on You Tube and suggest you go subscribe so you can see how passionate these guys are about bringing current and classical music together and making it cool.  Love them! Can't wait for the next song!
B005LAII1C|1.0|A nice premise turned into an F-laced, un-watchable mish-mash. My better half and I watched about a half hour of a vocabulary-challenged Boston Teddy bear spouting the f-bomb. We're not prudes by any stretch of the imagination but both think a little more imagination could have gone a long way to make a much better movie sans 'f-this,' 'f-that,' ad finitum, ad nauseum.<br /><br />Mila Kunis is a pretty, talented young actress but her fixation on the use of the F-word is decidedely UN-attractive. The last two pictures I seen her in has been laced with it. If that is any indication of her 'talent' I'll not buy another movie with her in it.<br /><br />Willik, USAF (Ret)
B007THA4FI|2.0|I struggled to read this book. It is very long and drawn out. A great disappointment from an avid reader.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|This review is more on the 'shipper', and not so much the 'product' itself. We all know this show is amazing!! One hell of a show!! I received the Season right on time, and for such a great price!
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I've always loved chess, but admittedly I am not really good at it.<br />This game is nice and simple, with multiple difficulty settings as well as player settings.<br />The interface is clean and does not lag.<br /><br />It is everything I would expect from an electronic chess game, without going to the next level of Chessmaster PC software.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham does it again!  Although this time there were few surprises. He just shows the nature of the legal profession.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I didn't think much of this game when it popped up as a deal but then I played it.<br />The music is poppy and catchy, the characters are cute, and the game is a simple interface (just swipe).<br />I liked it, reminded me of a lot of similar phone games, but then I noticed I just kept playing it. It is fun.<br /><br />Then it gets hard. Wow, like challenging. Once you get a bunch of guys on the same odd shaped ice, rocks blocking you, bombs...sometimes it is actually frustrating and I quit. I rage quit on a phone game! But I always come back to play more.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry is at it again with a new watch commander, not Connelly's best Bosh but well worth the time to read. I know there will be a time he will have to retire or kill off Harry Bosh but I hope it's not in the near future.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|You know these games, match the items they disappear, and the rows drop. Try to free the objects and beat the clock.<br />This game does it well, and in an interesting way and simple little story...a unique a fresh perspective but not reinventing the wheel.<br />Highly entertaining and one of the best games on my phone.
B005K15SPG|5.0|THIS IS AN GREAT CD I LOVE THIS CD THE MUSIC AND LYRICS SO WELL WRITTEN THE DELUXE EDITION GETS<br />YOU LIVE ,AND REGULAR  CD PLUSS MORE.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|FUN game! easy to get addicted.<br />Very much worth havng on my Kindle. Many hrs of enjoyment. Highly recommend<br />for anyone who loves anything Star Wars.
B002P4VUMQ|3.0|IT WAS OK I LIKE HIS MUSIC JUST BUT NOT ALL OF ITJUST SOME SONGS ARE GREAT<br />BUT NOT MY FAVORITE.
B0076DELIG|5.0|All of the Harry Bosch novels are great reading and I order one whenever I want a fast and entertaining read. The plot moves along and one is engrossed untill the end.  Always pulling for Harry and just wish at one point he would settle down and be happy.
0316228532|4.0|As a young adult who read and devoured Rowling's previous works, I was a little wary of reading her newest title, afraid that entering a non-magical world with one of my favorite authors would be somehow disappointing. And while I cannot say that I found an enchanting and familiar story inside this book, I also cannot say that I was disappointed.<br /><br />This new novel is miles away from Harry, his heroism, and the hope for a better world that drove Rowling's last series. Any reader expecting to see anything similar to Harry Potter should pick up something else. However, if you are interested in a psychological evaluation of humanity and its cruelty, this is definitely worth a read. In _The Casual Vacancy_, Rowling puts a small English village under an extrememly unforgiving microscope that shows every fault of every one of its citizens. Each person's life is examined and measured equally and Rowling shows herself to be a master at understanding people's true, often selfish, intentions. The only person whose life is not found wanting is the one and only Barry Fairbrother, the man whose death catalyzes the events in the novel, reminding us of the power of memory and nostalgia.<br /><br />True, the novel is long, starts slow, and has a large ensemble cast that is sometimes hard to keep track of. However, as you begin to learn about the characters and their stories begin to intertwine, you find yourself becoming a citizen of Pagford, with your own prejudices against characters and your own feeble excuses for why they are justified. The action continues to build until the truly catastrophic ending where the real victims of Pagford's war are revealed. While the ending is both dramatic and somewhat devastating, Rowling does leave her readers with, if not real hope, perhaps a glimpse of it.
0743270754|5.0|arrived before expected and was exactly what i thought it would be.  It is a Christmas gift, so I cannot attest to the contents of the book.
006097625X|2.0|used this book for an art class. used it sparingly. i think i resold it. not related to my nutrition major.
B0000028TN|5.0|Excellent percussion and vocals.....loved listening to all the tracks.  Something DIFFERENT to listen to that one doesnt usually hear on the radio.....
B0059XTV4Y|5.0|The contemporary story of Wallis was somewhat depressing but then again the story of Wallis and Edward was depressing.  Madonna gets a solid A in my book for an interesting story beautifully told.  I adore the final scene of Wallis dancing for her dying love, or should I say obligation.  Madonna, you deserve more credit for this film than you received and Weinstein, you never disappoint.
B005F265CA|5.0|this is the most funniest western comedy i ever enjoyed, i just love every scenes. three actors are so good and other characters as well.
B005T87QCI|1.0|I bought the app but then I tried install it but I cold not even download it says error it can be downloaded
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album!  I bought both the CD and the mp3 album for my iphone.  I listen to it everyday.  The music is absolutely beautiful.  I'm not crazy about the Bourne Vivaldi piece, but the rest I love.  My favorite is \\"Titanium.\\"  Very moving.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I really really wanted to like this book.  I really did.  But I've just stopped because there are too many characters and I can't get a point of view.  Is the hero the dead guy?  It keeps jumping around from person to person and flashback after flashback.  Maybe one day, when I'm not so busy, right after I finish my two volume set of Proust, I'm going to finish this. And I'll love it, and I'll regret not reading it sooner.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I deleted the app from my kindle.  it only showed the first couple of lines.  the rest was just sentences. I didn't like it.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|This is a great set of books. I actually started reading it with my mom, it's quite addictive.  I actually downloaded the audio version through audible.com as well.  It's a great way to read through a book that's so long.
1426308469|5.0|Very nice and informative book with nice, detailed pictures.<br />Would recommend this book for children. Full of information. Well done
037582913X|5.0|I remember this book from when I was a kid!  And now my son loves it too.  It makes him giggle every time.  And there is an App that tells the story too.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book like WOW. It is very dramatic and expressed lots of feeling.I gave this a 4 star because I can feel this story.It is like I was in this whole entire situation.I would recommend this book to my cousin Viola.She would have tears in her eyes when she finishes this book. :) (y)
034580404X|2.0|Not all it was cracked up to be.....was very disappointed!  Would not recommend it to others!  Rather read Danielle Steele!
B0086700CM|5.0|is pretty play this game.  the game is beautiful ok..yo. siempre he querido jugar estes judging se lo recomiendo a todo. el mundo
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book will keep your attention. From start to finish. E.L. James is a fantastic writer that gives lots if detail.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book was being read to the 4th grade class by the 4th grade teacher. To be able to discuss with my child I decided to read it. To my surprise I fell in love with characters and story. It is always better to be kind. Thank you R.J. and 4th grade teacher!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I still watch my little pony and when I saw this I bought it right away hope this will be fub
B00001QEE7|5.0|This was requested by our granddaughters and we were so happy to find in on Amazon. It is very good.
B004X2M3N8|5.0|fun, fanciful and serious rolled into one show.  I still miss googly eyes as the doctor, but Matt is fun to watch too.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is an excellent version and we could not find it in a local store. We are happy it arrived on time.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|this app is amazing you can get almost every thing only if you could write on the signs and get armor
B00A50PE6K|4.0|My only disappointment about this album is that it doesn't include Lea's version of, \\"Oh Holy Night\\" from last weeks episode where Rache Berry was aduitioning. Other songs from \\"future episodes\\" are said to be included
B002QKZLZ6|3.0|I was disappointed only because it's a pocket carrying case. It doesn't have belt clip or any thing. So unless you just leave it on your ear or maybe give it to your wife to put it on her purse in the case it's a let down. It is nice made of nice quality material, the Voyager fits in it perfectly, why not put a belt clip on it?
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This book surprised me.  Based on the title of the book alone, I would not have expected it to be as good as it was.<br />It was not exactly the drunk in Vegas, woke up married that it might appear to be.<br />For one thing, both the characters were sensible people, and at least one had thought this out pretty well.  They were not terribly immature, there were no ridiculous misunderstandings, just a difference in goals.<br /><br />The character's feelings about commitment are pretty typical for a contemporary romance.  Megan has been burned by relationships too many times, and has sworn off men.  Connor doesn't want an emotional relationship, but he wants a wife, and he wants stability and friendship.  Of course, between the beginning and the end we get to see them both change those opinions.<br /><br />The story itself was enjoyable, and held together pretty well.  There was sexual tension.  This is a fun way to spend a few hours in mindless escape from reality, so it delivered for me.  Recommended for a light, easy read.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This series is very very long and, of course, once you're in......I had to finish it but glad to be done.  This was a good knights and castles story :)
B004FRX0MY|1.0|Only one star as there's currently no way to configure where the app stores downloaded music. On my Samsung Galaxy S3 it ends up on the internal sdcard, taking up valuable storage space required for apps. So after downloading the music using the app, I have to manually copy the files to my external 64GB sdcard. Talk about usability... To me this makes the whole player as such a waste of time.<br /><br />What point is an integrated player/downloader if an additional manual step is required every time I want to store the music locally? The cloud feature is great when listening on the desktop but with the phone I often listen to music when there's no stable or only a very slow internet connection (e.g. when on a plane or long-distance train).<br /><br />So only one instead of 4 or 5 stars, as the software as such is not usable right now. Just download the files via the desktop, copy them over to the phone's external sdcard and use the built-in mp3 player. Much better user experience and less hassle!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Just as I expected - full of surprises and splendid action all anchored in all the known characters I have learnt to appraise over the years with Mitch Rapp.
B003VANOFY|2.0|the headphones keep failing.  it was a gift for a gamer and he got frustrated everytime it stopped working.  i don't recommend this product.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I liked this book although I found it a bit long for the kindle and kept losing my place(my problem) It was a good concept to use  the different families, from different parts of the world with background of WW1, the aristocracy, labor unrest, womens rights,<br />and the Russian Revolution.Looking forward to the next volume from Ken Follett in the trilogy.
B00AA0TJO8|1.0|I really want this game for my kindle fire but I have been reading there is a screen problem! please fix it hitcents!!!!!!! D:
B002ZG98UK|5.0|This is my 3D showoff piece.  The opening action scene is perfect for showing the capabilities of both the surround sound and 3D tv.  The movie is good if you are into the type.
B000HF0ISC|5.0|I really love this movie i could watch it a hundred times and won't get sick of it . Its a must see
B006R1T40I|5.0|She's a redhead and a complete artist.<br />Blues, jazz, love songs and rock.<br />I love her style and she does it all!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Always a good story teller, I thought his other novels were better written.  Not bad, just not up to his standard.
B005LAJ22Q|4.0|We love this show and was thrilled to get it at a much cheaper price than at the store. However at certain points while watching it the movie froze and skipped. Don't know if it was my player or the disc. It was delivered quicker than expected which is always a plus for us.
B007HO392S|5.0|I saw her perform this song on the CMA awards and was instantly pulled in by the lyrics, the music and her performance.  Never bought a Carrie Underwood itune or CD.  I now have two CD's and I love them
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its solitaire not much you can write about it. Theres lots of background colors to choose from and designs for the card backs to choose from but other than that its still just solitaire.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I just got it in the mail yesterday and I love listening to it!! <3 The quality is amazing and the music is outstanding.
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Extras include how film was made of about 20 minutes and also separate documentary of F1 in that time period (also 20+\- minutes).  Film has intermission part was through.
B0098460O4|4.0|The CD shows how they have grown together as performers. There is a marked improvement over the BGT performances. Looking forward to their next album.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the music and love the CD! Thank you guys! Everything they do sounds great! I am looking forward to more Christmas music this week!
B004GYY714|4.0|It has all your local stations. I like to listen to it while I'm cleaning my room or cooking or when I just want to hear music. Only thing is I think you have to have internet or a wifi connection.
B008K7RGA2|4.0|Thought the bass-baritone needed deeper richer voice.  Other wise was good.  The soprano and tenor are excellent and dont lack richness or depth.
B009VL28W2|4.0|This is my fourth, yes fourth, Metallica Blu-ray from this tour. I have the shows from Mexico, France, Big 4, and now this one. Hey, for a fraction of what I pay for a concert ticket, I get to own a Metallica show in stunning Blu-ray quality video and audio, and this is what you'll get with this disc. No disappointments here.  Video is stunning. Awesome black levels with minimal grain, evident only in shots using stationary cams of lesser quality. The laser show in the opening song gives evidence of the visual treat early on. The 5.1 DTS-HD Master audio is quite good also. Not the best I've heard, but overall well balanced and in-your-face.<br />With 8 out of the 10 songs from \\"Death Magnetic\\" on this one, it helps to like this CD, which I do. But the nicest surprise is the inclusion of the songs they don't play too often, such as Shortest Straw, Holier than Thou, Breadfan and Phantom Lord to name a few. I believe I enjoyed the Bonus Tracks and Footage portion more so than the full concert.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the editing, like most recorded concerts these days, SUCKS! Way too frantic with unnecessary zoom-ins and zoom-outs, with most shots only lingering about a second if that. I realize that this type of \\"ADD\\" editing gives the impression that the show is just bursting with non-stop action, but with Metallica, we all know these guys are no slouches. Just give me shots where I can watch each of the guys doing what they do best for 5 or 6 seconds, similar to the time I'd spend focusing on them if I was at the show. I've never been at a Metallica show and directed my attention from James, to Kirk, to Lars, to Rob, to Lars then back to James -all in the span of 3 seconds!<br />Its too bad this filming/editing style is so prevalent these days. I know for some viewers it's a non-issue, but for me it knocks an otherwise 5-star rating down to AT BEST a 4. Sad, but true!
0307454541|5.0|I have read this book over and over- also on audio book, and the movies are great too, just hard to read some parts!
B000001EYO|1.0|This cd does not have any  of the John Fogerty music, or any of the really good songs.  So, buy at your own risk.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app it has amazing pictures and the edit is awesome! I also love how I can chafing every thing without going on the computer
B009A9BEHU|5.0|If you're a Coldplay fan this is the cd/dvd for you.  The visuals are great and so is the music.
B0002HZ18C|3.0|The color of the plastic is red. Red is a very difficult color to paint over<br />and at times I thought I would stop building/painting it. I kept at it and<br />it did turn out OK but not one of my best pieces.
B009APMNB0|2.0|Hardware:<br /><br />27&#34; iMac 2.7ghz i5<br />24&#34; Dell U2412hm display connected by minidisplayport to DVI.<br /><br />The dell screen wont calibrate - the colors are so far off that it looks beyond terrible. Completely un-usable. I returned it to Amazon and am going to purchase a more expensive unit. I did not give it a 1 star because I was able to calibrate the iMac screen.<br /><br />Software was easy to use, but that make no difference if the colors look terrible!
B009RI4FRU|1.0|Not funny - this style is just TIRED.  It peaked at the life aquatic - and that one may have just been lucky since Bill Murray and Jeff Goldblum carried it.  Each iteration appears to get less funny - same art style.<br /><br />Pass on Wes until there is a Life Aquatic 2.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys and their music is amazing. From my 11 year old daughter to 16 year old son to my 80 year old father, The Piano Guys creations make us feel good. The magic Steven makes on his cellos has inspired my children to actually practice their cellos.

B001KOFH2G|5.0|I loved this movie. It has a great storyline and lots of action. If you enjoyed the TV series Firefly, you'll enjoy this.
0345529057|5.0|The seller did a fantastic job of sending the books to me.  I haven't finished all the books yet.  The books themselves I found interesting.  The style of jumping around from character group to character group was a somewhat a put off.  That was mainly because I like to get into a character and stick with it during a story.  Having to stop and think.... wait, who is this again?... was not something that made the books feel like a continuous story to me.  Other then that the story, so far, has been great.
B001EN71CW|5.0|All of the TV episodes in one little box. And an excellent series it was as well. Small price to pay for the entire series and all on Blu Ray too. Wow...
0525953728|5.0|The book is very good and the story is very good and eight more words well it was just great book to read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|LOVE Harry Bosch books - this was anohter great book by Michael Connelly who is one of the best mystery writers!
B000000W8C|4.0|Verified Purchase(What's this?)  This review is from: Northern Soul (Audio CD)    No one with a conscious mind fails to realize that death is a universal occurrence that lasts forever (at least from a physical standpoint) and that one day our existence is going to come to an end. The ramification of this awareness can be felt on a metaphysical and emotional level as well; some who believe that death lasts forever and extinguishes the force that animates human consciousness and emotion have a difficult time making a positive adjustment to this (perceived) reality with no love, life, or anything else of value existing after we cease to do so, and fall into both isolation and despair as a result.    And boy howdy, is this feeling channeled and otherwise communicated throughout the length of \\"A Northern Soul\\", to the point where it's the dominant vibration expressed on this release at an emotive level,despite the frequent interludes of truly compelling music on this recording. Typical instrumentation we universally associate with conventional arranged rock songs allow \\"A Northern Soul\\" to unfold in a more linear fashion than its predecessor, \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" which was situated at the intersection of shoegaze and space-rock, swathed and cocooned in a massive wash of reverb, echo, and delay. Nick McCabe's guitar is still the essential driving force behind the songs composed for \\"A Northern Soul\\"; it just isn't sounding like it's transmitting elongated drones that emerge into from a dimensional rift halfway across the universe as it seemed to do on \\"..Storm\\", sounding as if it's levitating resonating fragments of crystal in a multiplicative chiming pattern, or pushing the distortion pedal until it becomes a pipeline for the roar of the universe. Sure, we'll hear a swirl of arpeggiated notes, but they're by no means as uniformly present and universally sweeping as what appeared on their full-length debut, with the possible exception of the closing tracks,\\" Stormy Clouds\\" and \\"Reprise\\". And while the peaks and valleys defining build-up to explosive crescendos haven't been abandoned, they're no longer the focal point either, because while there are many beautiful passages where McCabe's guitar hovers and glides in a slightly psychedlic fashion, the songs written for \\"A Northern Soul\\" seem to be more structured w/r/t melody and arrangement, and less about magnitude and the buildup of dynamic tension. For instance, \\"Drive You Home\\" is oriented around an acoustic guitar,joining \\"On Your Own\\" in unfolding as a ballad, while \\"History\\" is a track built around orchestration, a precursor of what was to come on \\"Urban Hymns\\". Most of the semipsychedelic material begins and ends with a moderately high level of intensity (\\"A New Decade\\", \\"This Is Music\\" and \\"A Northern Soul\\", just off the top of my head), and stays at that plateau in between, throwing off a tremendous amount of energy, but by and large never seeming to escalate organically, and while the production values give it a booming atmosphere, often displays a sense of tenseness approaching an almost oppressive quality at times.    No real unifying, universal thread is running through the music contained within \\"A Northern Soul\\"; there's too much disparity between each track from the standpoint of arrangement to argue that it possesses the singular quasi-orchestral focus of \\"Urban Hymns\\", or the quiescent-to-explosive, fluidly-toned dynamic of \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" that runs from tracks 1 through 4 and 7, while \\"Butterfly\\" and \\"Blue\\" come the closest in prior linkage. But the sound itself, augmented by Richard Ashcroft's plaintive vocals declaiming in anguished tones about peak experiences and mindsets that can never be relived or even definitively recaptured in a raw, wringing, emotive voice, lends itself to creating what is overall a soundscape driven by a feel of desperation, loneliness, and existential angst that can't be resolved by participating in addictive behaviors, and that's where the universal thread can be drawn through. I recommend it, but suggest that you listen to \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" and \\"The Verve\\" EP beforehand.    Comment   Permalink
B007UWBGVS|5.0|Okay - let me start by saying, I do not agree with all of this man's choices or lifestyle, however, I think he is a phenomenal singer! His ability is out of this world! This album had a lot to live up to from his first album. Just to stand up to &#34;For Your Entertainment&#34;. And it does.<br /><br />&#34;Better Than I Know Myself&#34; and &#34;Never Close Our Eyes&#34; are both great, great songs! Gorgeous lyricism and pitch perfect notes. &#34;Shady&#34; is a very good song. I feel in love with it the first time I heard it, and &#34;Underneath&#34; is one of the best examples of how to hold out a note! &#34;Pop That Lock&#34; and &#34;Naked Love&#34; also great songs. Simply from the fact that I love so many of the songs, I have to give this 5 stars!
B005LLSNNE|4.0|Christmas present...they loved it..I personally never watched it but my family wanted it so...gift to them which was a hit
0316227706|3.0|I felt a lot of the pictures were too similar but the photography was fun.  I appreciate that it was sent in time for Christmas.
B003QSMC18|5.0|Great movie! Even as a grown up I enjoyed it. I love that it had a modern twist and still held onto fantasy. Well written and kids will love it!
0316228532|3.0|I was anxious to read this book when it came out.  It was th 50th book are little book club read...most of us were not terribly impressed.  It was OK, but not a blockbuster at all.  It dragged ever so much...it was the type of book you could read, put down for days, pick up and plug away.  We were glad we read it after all the Harry Potter stuff, but a great disappointment.  Characters were OK, story was slow to develop, a little twist at the end....just not engaging.<br /><br />MLK
B0049J0DC8|5.0|I've always loved this movie. I think it is great no matter your age. I hope you enjoy as much as I did.
B0086WQNZ0|4.0|There are two big DVD sets in which you might be interested if you are looking at this: First the \\"Gould Plays Bach\\" 3 DVD set, and also the \\"Complete CBC Recordings\\" 10DVD set.  This box includes all of \\"Gould Plays Bach\\" and the best discs from the CBC Recordings relevant to Bach.  And I believe there is also at least one DVD here that is not in that larger set.  In short, if you just love Gould's Bach, this set has all the good performance footage!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead. the quality was amazing, there was no stopping to load. can't wait for season 4!
0938045768|5.0|paul wade really delivers what he promises. serious information on how to get strong with natural movements that use our evolutionary wisdom and reveals our physical potential.<br />man, are we strong!<br />i'm truly thankful for this book and use it daily.<br />i'm 48, working with youngsters and just discover more and more of my physical possibilities.<br />buy it, use it, you won't regret it!<br />e.m.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I bought this for my husband because it is his all time favorite movie. I was a little disappointed that when it came the DVD wasn't secured into the snap in the middle of the case. But it wasn't damaged or scratched and played beautifully. Funny as ever!
B0002IQEHI|5.0|Love this movie and bought it as a Christmas Gift for family who I know will enjoy a really good Hitchcock mystery (not too scary).  Amazon delivered fast. Great purchase for the price...and easy too!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|I could watch this movie 100 times and still want to watch it more. I find myself quoting it throughout the day! &#34;Frying pans, who knew?&#34;
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|this game is so cute and fun though I wish you could get coins a lil easier.also idea for an animal to add penguins please
B00A0SQBDM|1.0|I have tried downloading on my Kindle Fire about 8 times and everytime it gets to the very end of the download the game disappears!  So frustrated!  I have already paid for it too!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|so far so good I love piton my iphone so wanted to try it on my kindle fire.<br />its a great game
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Love the series, can't get enough of it. Love the characters. Have to have entire series to rewatch!! Jax's is the best
B009S33I68|5.0|Historical book, well written, covers the material well. Would recomend it to anyone interested in the history of the viet nam conflict or who wants to go into the armed services. Could not put the book down.
B001QB5S3G|4.0|The movie was is good quality. It instantly uploaded and I didn't have to do much besides sit back and watch.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|Not the high quality humor of the other ones.  Possibly took itself too seriously.  Bad guys were overtly more violent.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing is so many wAys!!<br />I will recommend this to all my friends and am looking forward to the last book
B0095J0AL6|5.0|I love the boys' second album. I mean, usually you can pick a favorite song eventually but it's been a month and I haven't stopped listening to it and I can't pick a favorite, all the songs are great!
B0095VP8D4|5.0|Runs great, make sure you get high rated memory, DDR 3 2400 (Helps with Games based on reviews) and a board that supports higher rated ram. Wish it came with a better cooler. Will be buying another but for a Micro ATX board.
0425263908|5.0|Wow! Loved this book! At first when I began Bared to You by Sylvia Day I was a tad put-off considering it a copycat of Fifty Shades of Grey by E.L. James. But read on! As the story unfolds Day presents an entirely different view of a possessive, powerful, sexy, and oh so screwed up billionaire that is Gideon Cross. Day's writing is fluid and smart and the love scenes are sizzling without the Fifty Shades handcuffs, floggers, blindfolds etc. Instead, Day's scenes are primal and sexual--hands-on, if you will. ;}<br />I loved how the heroine, Eva, in this story was just as damaged as the hero, Gideon Cross. Eva's best friend and sidekick, Cary Taylor, is also a victim of sexual abuse and offers Eva support and insights, but then becomes a bit of an antagonist when his sexual deviations get the best of him.<br />Bared to You offers the reader a roller coaster ride of emotions through Eva and Gideon. You want them to find their way through their messed-up lives and find the happiness they are desperately searching for--not so fast! Day makes you wait for it in the fact that there are more books to this series--I can't wait to start the next!<br /><br />BTW--who's the sexiest man alive? Why it's Christian Cross, of course! ;}
B00846REIS|4.0|One of the reasons I enjoy reading series is the ending, most of the time they leave you craving for more. Bared to You lacks that ending that I was a sooo wanting, and I was very disappointed. On the bright side though, I was looking for a novel similar to the Fifty Shades series, and I got almost exactly what I wanted. Both very similar and erotic, and yet vastly different.
B00A77II0U|5.0|It was worth the price for a few hours of game play and puzzles. I did not experience any issues during download or glitches during play.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was such an exciting season so far and I can't wait until it resumes. The mid-season finale ended with a cliff hanger as usual. The characters in this show are what makes it good for me not just blood and gore of Zombies. Even if you don't really like Zombie stuff you might like this as it go's beyond the Zombie genre.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great product! I love passing the time by pinning and reviewing info from other pins. My only gripe is that sometimes the server is not responding and/or there is a delay in response. This often occurs when the app needs to be restarted. It beats the mobile site by a long shot, though.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|This is the story of a genteel woman with a scandal to hide and an aristocrat with secrets.  Not precisely something new in the Historical Romance genre, right? Not so! This story is so well and intricately plotted that it is one of the most original romances I've yet to read.  Two Victorian radicals set out to best each other at their respective games and proceed to fall in love, but not until there are events upon events that appear to drive them apart.<br /><br />Courtney Milan can write characters that breathe true life into a story.  They have histories that totally explain their foibles and actions. She conjures up a heroine that is not the usual raving beauty but who is a beautiful person.  Our hero is troubled and nearly done-in by his past. The scandal and secrets are given to us in increments and we wonder can all of the calamity coming at them keep them apart?  This is what kept me reading straight through until the last page. There is action, pathos, romance,surprises, a fabulous story and the most original sex scene.  I cannot wait to read the rest of this series.
B005LA3Z9M|5.0|I read an average of four books per week and most just bounce off me but this book enthralled me. just gorgeous.
B006LSZECO|5.0|LIKE A HE SAID, SHE SAID.  VERY CLEVER WRITING AND BELIEVABLE STORY RIGHT TO THE END.  EASY TO SEE WHY IT STAYED ON BEST SELLER LISTS SO LONG.
B001FB55I0|5.0|This is an excellent &#34;Prequel&#34; to the Arnold Schwartzenegger series of Terminator movies.  Action Packed and very well done.  It's a movie that you can watch multiple times and still enjoy it.
B007X4ECMI|4.0|Guy Pierce is a good actor!  He did a fine job in this movie.  I like it and recommend it.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Sad at the beginning, but a great story about a man who never gives up on his dream or his promise to his wife.<br /><br />I love the talking dogs and how they add humor into what dogs might think at times.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This is an interesting twist to &#34;hidden history&#34;.  One does not have much information about the real Abraham Lincoln, really.
B000N0WCLC|4.0|If you can get past the violence and language, this film makes you really think about those precious stones (diamonds) that we buy here in America.
B009VB97EY|2.0|I am sure the ladies will relate to it but it is a high price to pay see Channing in a thong.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|My wife first turned me onto this show and I have to admit that it's pretty good.  I purchased the complete series of seasons for my wife as a Christmas Gift.  Can't wait to surprise her!<br /><br />Makes me long for more wholesome TV Series shows on current networks!
B005Q4CKNA|5.0|The movie makes more sense once you see &#34;Avengers.&#34;  I saw &#34;Avengers&#34; first and then wanted to see &#34;Captain America.&#34;
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great movie (based on a true story) that portrays the importance of caring for others and using the resources and blessings that we have in order to help care for others in society.<br /><br />It mixes the story of warm family caring for a boy with football to create an environment that the whole family can enjoy.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It may have been a bit over the head for the younger children, like most animated movies nowdays, but they still enjoyed it. Lots of laughing. The last few minutes may be frightening to young kids, though.
B00168OIOE|5.0|I loved this movie from the first time I saw it... The viewpoint from a monster's perspective which I think can even help young kids to not be afraid of the dark.  This is a great movie that the whole family can enjoy!
B008Y1YJ90|5.0|Eveyone enjoyed it. Like most animated movies in the past couple of years, it's a bit much for the kids. Since most mainstream movies in the past couple of years have proved unwatchable, it was fun for tha adults.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I put this on my Kindle Fire. The game is OK. But I keep getting assaulted by ads. At times it is hard to get the ad to stop and return to the game. Zero stars due to the annoying ads offsets any kind of favorable rating I might give for the game itself, so just gave it one star. Could be fun if they would put the ads somewhere that leaves the game still useable. As is, I will stop playing it.
B007PVHMCG|1.0|I was really disapointed when this lego set arrived. when i looked at the price of the set i thought it was going to be a larger set. WRONG!  The box was not much bigger than a soda can. the cost was $137.  I found Target has the same exact set for $34.00 which is a savings of over a hundred dollars. Do some better research before you buy this one
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My 3 year old son requested this game after seeing it on his cousins Kindle Fire and he loves it!
B0091LRZZW|4.0|I saw the PBS of the Kisses on the Bottom and project. It was very nice in black and white. Classic. Of course it is a sincerly good story show. How could it not be when Paul Mccartney is singing these lovely classics.<br />I truly miss his own writing of his own songs. I look forward to these. It is never too late for the the genius<br />of songs to bless us with a few more of his own creation..<br />This you  will enjoy as a documentary type of studio recording session<br />Remarkable singing<br />these are lovely songs.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|The look and oddly enough the smell of this doll is so cute, my daughter (4) still loves it and I bought it 2 years ago
B008RC72G8|4.0|I ENJOY CAMPY MOVIES. THIS MOVIE IS FUN, NOT AS GOOD AS &#34;LOVE AT FIRST BITE&#34; BUT IT IS FUN TO WATCH THE SPECIAL EFFECTS.  I THINK THE ENDING COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER, BUT IT IS STILL WORTH SEEING. PURCHASED IT FROM AMAZON AND FAST DELIVERY.
B007THA4FI|1.0|After a few chapters, I decided that my precious time is wasted reading this book.  A popular author's name does not necessarily beget a good book. F words are just &#34;fillers&#34;...and unfamilar long words send me to the dictionary. Life is too short!
B005HI4LMS|5.0|i love it. blatant humor, suttle humor, hidden humor, a really hot chick, creative deaths, and redneck stereotyping. aside from the bad guy overacting at times, this movie is great. i bought one for my parents too. though they would get a kick out of it and they did.
B0061S073A|5.0|it does exactly what it's supposed to, BUT....there are a few changes that I hope the manufactuer thinks about when it comes to updating (and if so, I'd be willing to pay for it)<br /><br />1) you cannot view any BOOKS, only APPS<br />2) you cannot RE-ARRANGE the apps in the order you would like (such as on the main favourites tab).  Some apps I'm tired of her playing with and would like to put them on the bottom so she can give others a chance, but the only arrangement is alphabetical.<br />3) having to enter my passcode to adjust the sound is annoying. It would be nice if that was an option I could uncheck under parental controls.<br /><br />Beyond that, thanks for this FREE APP....it works fine on my Kindle Fire and I feel a lot more comfortable handing the kindle to my 2.5 y/o daughter sitting in front of me on the couch then I did before.
0399159029|5.0|I have read every one of the series and Mr. Kerr retains his high degree of expertise in this noir category.  It is like hearing from an old friend with each installment.  The story teaches the reader about the people both famous and more obscure that made this period in history so notorious, while telling a darn good mystery yarn.  Both entertaining and educational.
B001VIMCW4|2.0|After the glory that was Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace provided a shockingly sub-par performance for Craig & his producers.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Product is awesome....but seven days after I purchased it went down $25.  You should have a price guarantee so many days after purchase.  I feel like you ripped me off!!!!!!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Blu Ray is an absolute must for any movie lover.  Turns the already awesome film to an at home movie Theater experience.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it works fine on my kindle fire, I'm able to search for think w /o a problem. its slow on my phone but runs fine on the fire
B003KGBISY|5.0|I bought this product while it was on sale.  All the films in the Criterion Collection are great films.  Akira Kurosawa is a world renowned Film Director and this film is a reason why.  His cinematography paved the way for the future.  Great Film!
B009E3EY38|4.0|I've been a fan for 32 of my 37 years.  I have over 100 bootlegs,  including a bootleg cd of this concert.  If I had to complain about anything,  it was realizing A LOT of guitar touchups in the studio.  I'm guessing that's why it took so many years to come out.  I think that explains why the cameras switch so much,  so you don't notice Pages fingers don't match up with what he's doing on the guitar. Don't get me wrong,  this copy is amazing and it's nice to know that even if it had to be doctored in the studio they can still do it.  It just depresses me that Page can't do it live.  Hasn't really been able to do it live since 77.  He's a living example of why not to do heroin.  Listen to the undoctored How The West Was Won from 1972.  He was amazing there.  Then the heroin took his abilities.  Plus on my bootleg,  you can hear alot of Jason Bonham rushing through the drum fills, coming out of them ahead of the band.  They fixed that pretty well also.  Plant only fixed a couple of things which he admitted to.  JOHN PAUL JONES,  ALL NATURAL!!!
0321857895|3.0|Flipping through the preview of this book, I'm reminded of Jim Franklin's work decades ago and the CRS \\"snow card\\" technique.<br /><br />Glad to see that the value of their techniques is being recognized by a larger audience.  Sad that they're not around to be compensated for it.  It'd be great if they were acknowledged.  \\"If I have seen further it is by standing on ye sholders of Giants.\\" -- Isaac Newton paraphrasing Bernard of Chartres.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The book wasn't' hard to . Put down as some have Been. Waiting for book 2 to determine overall opinion.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good book, enjoyable read which was hard to put down. Didn't last long enough due to that quality. I like Grisham's forays beyond the &#34;lawyer book&#34;.

B008DM4OTA|5.0|My daughter loves this game! While we are waiting in line at the stores or at Disneyland, she plays with it to keep her entertained. It' easy enough that she does not get frustrated by the game, but still challenging enough for it to be fun.
B006KX3GXO|3.0|sent an up grade lost all my clip art :( very dissapointed with the up grade! no Christmas chip art sucks
B009LDCZDC|5.0|The story is so full of suspense and fantastic characters... The twist and turns in the story are fantastic, and the relationship and chemistry between Carry & Brody is just electric... worth atching tima and time again...<br /><br />I think is going to be a repeat of sweeping all the Emmys and any other respectable prize around...<br /><br />I can not imagine what the writers are going to come up with next
B009HELT3C|5.0|A little more touching than we expected (good). Typical big budget production values, exceptional plot, and better than expected acting.  Will Smith did a superb job of handling what Hollywood appears to consider mandatory racial profiling scenes of a black professional in the 1960's.  It may be hard for Hollywood to believe, but not every cop or white person in America was racist in the 60's.  Outside of that short spot, this is one of the better movies we've seen in some time. Brolin is remarkable as a young Agent 'K'.
0679805273|5.0|good for everyone regardless of life stage of life=<br />good read, good gift, good for all ages, read it and enjoy
0780626966|5.0|I was more than happy when this box set arrived. It even came witht he 3D glasses. I was so excited. It was stated that it was used but it was in excellent shape. I would def suggest this buyer to anyone!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It's a fun game, but my update for Hoth hasn't come through yet, which is annoying. Other than that I've had a lot of fun playing with a light saber!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guy's are Amazing, and I love listening to their music.  It is so relaxing.  My husband uses it in his Massage practice for his customers to listen to while getting a massage.
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I never even heard about this book until a couple months ago. I don't to a lot of recreational reading but this book sucked me in. It is a little silly that Amazon sells the version that is specifically for the ipad. You do not miss much if you are using Android so don't worry about it.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I love this movie with a passion. It is very fun and energetic and of course Christina and Cher are stunning and fantastic movie. This is perfect for a girls night and the guys love it too! :)
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I guess it's all a matter of what your taste is, but my whole family loves this CD, so it's an easy one to agree on when we're all in the car, etc.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Great Book - read it for our book club.<br />What great discussions we had.<br />Highly recommended!<br />Enjoy you will like it!
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Ghost In The Shell - Solid State Society what else do I need to say? This whole series is solid, and this movie is too. I still prefer the series and the original over this, but it definitely was a cool addition. It's too bad they couldn't make a good release of GITS2 - Innocence.
0865479410|4.0|Our culture has been inundated with books, seminars, and self help programs centered around the power of positive thinking.  And while positive thinking surely can help in many situations, if it were really the end all be all, shouldn't the world have a lot less problems than it does?  If the secret to it all really was to positively envision ourselves as wealthy, shouldn't we all be rich by now?  So, given that the power of positive thinking is not all encompassing, perhaps there are other paths to happiness, enlightenment, and success.  And perhaps one of these paths is in the exact last place you would expect it to be, in pursing the things positive thought tells us to avoid.<br /><br />While I generally consider myself a positive thinker, in all actuality, I am a realist.  Having worked in a corporate culture where I was assured if I wanted the company's version of success bad enough I would get it, I personally hold little stock in the positive thought movement.  No amount of thinking I am going to be a great salesperson is ever going to make me a great salesperson.  I knew this, and accepted it, all the while continuing to do my best.  No amount of arbitrary goal setting (sell enough to buy this car, and as motivation hang a picture of it at your desk!!!) was going to miraculously turn me into a top producer.  Because I was honest about my inadequacy, not only was I failing at my job, in their mind I was failing at being a positive, motivated, goal oriented person (which is total crap).  So, I am glad that someone is finally speaking out about the fact that positive thinking does not always work.<br /><br />I like that this book points out a lot of the flaws in the whole self help culture.  I found the book to be very well written, each chapter covering a different aspect of the pursuit of happiness.  A lot of psychological and philosophical ideas are discussed throughout the text, making me wish I had a better background in philosophy.  I did find it interesting to learn that apparently my approach to life is in line with Stoicism and the teachings of Albert Ellis.  While I was previously aware of Ellis' teachings, I was not aware of the Stoic school of philosophical thought, so knowing I was following it without even trying to was a bit fascinating.<br /><br />I personally do not care for most self-help books, so this book was perfect for me.  It is kind of the anti-self help book.  And for people who typically love self help books, I think this book could have profound impact, much more that the plethora of books on their shelves already.<br /><br />I received a review copy courtesy of the publicist in exchange for an honest review.ing to learn that apparently my approach to life is in line with Stoicism and the teachings of Albert Ellis.

B00006LPEY|5.0|This might be the classic of all classics when it comes to Anime. I can't believe this movie came out a year before I was born, and the animation in this movie is still one of the best animations I've seen in an anime.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so far this is by far a great game tons of fun and lots to do the most fun I have had in along time
B00536OCZA|1.0|After reading other reviews and realizing this album was pressed by the same plant that the new Beatles Vinyl Box set I was wary of playing this album for fear of disappointment. As one of the great all time rock albums this classic masterpiece should not be butchered by shoddy manufacturing in this day and age. Despite a visible warp in the record i set the needle down figuring it wasn't much worse than some of the other albums I have, many of which are over 40 years old. To my delight, side 1 was an excellent listen with great sound and clarity although some passages did not seem right. Upon flipping to side 2 my worst fears came true as the warp was worse on this side causing my cartridge to physically bottom out against the record and issue an audible thump at each revolution during the opening passages of Money. What a bunch of bull. I lifted the needle and immediately sent a request for a refund and sat down to write this review. I was hoping all the negative reviews about albums pressed at this plant (Rainbo) were an anomaly and not the norm. Unfortunately I was wrong. After inspecting the album closer I also noticed some non fill issues which didnt affect the sound on side 1 and since I didn't make it past 15 seconds on side 2 I can't comment on that part.<br /><br />My used 70s version has no such issues and still plays beautifully after 30+ years. What a crock. The quality of this album was so disappointing that it forced me to write my first review. Interestingly my Wish You Were copy from this series has none of these issues. It's flat, no non-fill issues and sounds outstanding. Go figure.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Very good but at the same time engaging and historically accurate novel of the early 20th century, the reasons for WWI and the struggle for the rights of working people in early 20th century England and Russia.
B00127RAJY|4.0|IIt actually takes 25 minutes but i didnt mind. Great workout and keeps you moving and sweating ! I'd recommend it!
B0011UBDTK|3.0|This series is great, however the pink-case production of them is glitchy.  Some discs will skip or there is one episode that will not play at all.  I have read other reviews with the same problems.  I would recommend buying, Sex and the City the Complete Collection as opposed to this, the complete series.  It will cost a little more, but there won't be any problems with the discs.
B00A11AN6O|5.0|The Cloud Drive Photos is easy to use touch and hold the picture you want backed up and select to cloud and it uploads. 5GB at no cost is cool. Now i done have to worry about Google deleting my pics. due to content. They are my pics and no one else should be looking at them.
B008476HBM|5.0|This is by far my favorite Jane Austen book.  Her characters are fabulous and easily come to life from the page.  Elizabeth Bennet is very charming and witty and you can't help but root for her and her zany family.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I saw this movie on the Hallmark Channel and just had to have it.  Im a huge animal lover and the love between the man and his dog touch my heart in a big way.  I recomend this movie for the whole family.
B001DDBCUA|3.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It was nice to see where the girls have ended up a few years after the season ends.  I especially enjoyed the supporting role of Jennifer Hudson, she is so charming in this movie.  The story-line flows flawlessly from the end of the series--it's a must have for any SATC fan!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|It was great to read this classic once again. Read it years ago and forgot how great especially around the holidays
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I have the entire series and the first movie...and I loved them.  Sex and the City 2 isn't as risque as the first one, which I liked, but it wasn't as great of a story line either.  It was a little dull.  I only bought it to complete my SATC set -- but I don't watch this one nearly as much as I watch the series or the fist movie.
B009MF56GC|4.0|it arrived in the time frame and a good movie great gift idea for any action movie buff awsome good
B009FB3XTA|4.0|I own the first two soundtracks and had to have this one. I love the re-do of &#34;A thousand years&#34;.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|marvel does not disappoint with this all out action movie if you only like one of the heros you will like the rest
1416550534|4.0|Fun read, but kept point of viewbased on the servents ideas never looking at a way to tell the story from how others felt about living their private lives.
B005LAIHPY|4.0|this is nothing like the board game I grew up with but it was still good sci fi action movie
B008BM9L72|5.0|what else can be said about this book that haven't been said already about readers or media or word of the mouth
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I got this because of the price and because I needed more blu rays. The movie quality is great for its time.
B000VHQ1T6|5.0|Why is Bruch not well known??  This is great music on a par with Brahms.  I intend to listen to more of his works.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|For fans of the Jack Ryan series, this is definitely a must read.  They really bring in all the elements of the story and while there are about 15 different plot lines to keep up with, it all ties in at the end.
0547884591|5.0|The 4-Hour Chef does a fantastic job of utilizing cooking skills to teach you how to learn anything.  It is a great resource and is my favorite of his books thus far.  If you want to learn how to deconstruct skills and learn more effectively I highly suggest you check this out..
B000FC130E|5.0|Gaiman does an excellent job making you really associate and feel what the main character is feeling.  You want him to succeed and  you want him to make it.  You really start to feel like you could be absorbed into neverwhere yourself.
B0096CDG0O|4.0|Nice way to play with friends that are far away.  Works fine, but can get a little boring if you play too much.
B000I9U9A4|2.0|Having read some of the books, I was really excited to watch this movie.  It just never could get going.  There was so much dealing with the boat that the plot line never progressed, and had I not read the book, I wouldn't have known what was going on.  I didn't even finish the movie, so maybe it got better after the first hour, but I'll never know.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|Got into this show a lot later than most, but so glad that I did!  Such a great show with unexpected turns!
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I've read this book several times. I first bought it on paperback and I ended up giving that one away.  So then I had to buy it on Kindle so I could read it again.  Gaiman and Pratchett work so well together, you can't even tell when one writer ends and another begins.  This is one of my favorite all time reads. It will change your religion.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Who doesn't love shooting birds at the mean pigs? Very fun and addictive game that you just don't seem to tire of.
1401937519|5.0|This is one of the most inspiring books I have read.  I have given it as a gift to several friends!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Pictionary on a Kindle?!  This is it!!  It is tons of fun and I love playing it!  It is very fun even if you aren't very good at drawing!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I liked this book but it wasn't as good as the first. I still recommend the series but I felt like this book was a filler.
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Perfect for vampire and history lovers. Ideal how they put the past history into a sci-fi horror about a dead president. Will never look at the government the same way again! I hope there is a secret vampire but kicking society under our noses. Yay!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Just what I was looking for.  Straight up simple solitaire. At first I didn't realize I could just tap the cards and was swiping them into place.
B005G6QF8Y|5.0|I happen to come across this album and bought it based on the samples. It is a good album with good upbeat dance songs. It reminds of the first album from lady gaga. I say try on the samples and if seems intriguing you should buy it, you won't regret it.
B009NOVCTM|5.0|Bought this for my dad for Christmas. Came in plastic wrap and was brand new as described. Can't wait to give it to him!
B007XNAOS0|5.0|I never heard of Baroness before this album. I am so glad I bought this! I like a lot of tunes from Red and Blue, but this album is different.  Perhaps quite a bit mellower, but melodic and interesting.  Listen to the previews here of \\"Little Things\\", \\"Mtns (Crown and Anchor)\\" and \\"Eula\\", they will give you a feel of the music on this album.  And of course there are a few killer heavy tunes here!  I did make an edit of the album so it would fit on one cd and would be better for mp3 randomization. The \\"theme songs\\" are kind of repetitive and unnecessary except to add to the overall trancelike feel of the album.<br /><br />Anyway, this is the best album I've purchased in years and one of my all time favourites.  Some review I read said they were sounding QOTSA-ish and I definitely notice some of that in the music and leads, but for me this isn't a bad thing, it's also what made me start listening to Mastodon.<br /><br />Hopefully the band recovers from the bus crash and get back at it. If you look at the picture of Baizley's arm on their website and read the story, it's evident that this was almost the end.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I can listen to everything from my local PBS station to the BBC. BBC 4 Extra is perfect when I can't sleep. Dramas and comedies in the middle of the night. I think it's the best Kindle product I've got.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Great show!  I love the story lines and the suspenseful endings in every episode.  This is definitely the best series I have seen in a long time.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|The greatest minds talking about almost anything you can imagine and things you never thought of before. Entertaining, educational, inspirational (as long as you don't dwell too long on &#34;What am I doing with my life?&#34;).
B005ETA5K2|1.0|For backtrack wep and wpa hacking. Some listers on the web did not make it clear that the NHR was bad and H was good. Had to return.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Makes me smile everytime I hear their music! Inpirational, uplifting, peaceful, upbeat all wrapped into one!  Piano Guys are so gifted, creative, and put their hearts into their music.  My children love their music as well.
B004XANKVO|4.0|Just be sure to get out the cash as this was the priciest device I have ever seen. Great padding and compartments.
0345803485|1.0|I purchased this book as a gift for a White Elephant for my own amusement. The thought of watching a co-workers look of horror as they open this book is beyond satisfying, however the book itself... well I worry. I worry that young women will read this and think it's well written. It's not. I highly recommend checking out a review on Good Reads if you want to be entertained and get a true synopsis of the plot and writing, I could never do it justice. I also worry that this is how women will think they should be treated by men... not necessarily  the S&M hoo hah, but thinking that they should be more passive and let them men be in charge at all times. Oh lord ladies.... it's a quick-ish read at least and the book itself is in perfect, brand new condition, so no complaints there.<br /><br />Also in writing this review I should mention that I have read all three books. They do not get any better... but ya know, once you commit you might as well finish is what I say.
B00005TQKQ|5.0|Has done a good job of keeping my old digital camera from Panasonic in tip top shape. Dust and dirt are bad.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|the Piano Guys are one of my favorite modern musicians. They take old songs and give them a new twist. They take new songs and give them a classic twist. No song of theirs is unpleasant, and it is very uplifting. I would suggest this album for anyone that enjoys piano and cello music.
B004GJDQT8|4.0|But could use a little more functionality like the web. But should improve over time. Makes life good on an ipad though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Probably play this game at least once every day, and I find that it helps pass the time if I'm sitting in the doctors office or waiting for an appointment.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|Too long (what?) 2 hour 45 min movie?<br /><br />The villain was terrible, Anne Hathaway embarrassed Cat Women everywhere & Alfred was a whiny little b****.<br /><br />Nothing fun about this movie.<br /><br />Trout have more soul than this Batman!  A Trout is a fish for those of you apathetic morons reading this review.<br /><br />So breath in the Batfart Gotham - you've earned it.<br /><br />This movie was almost as good as &#34;Steel&#34;. However you might say Shaq's acting was superb in comparison.<br /><br />This movie was only slightly better than - Nope. Can't think of a worse movie.<br /><br />Compared to this movie &#34;Son of mask&#34; kicked ass. Even John Ritter was a better Hero @ Large.<br /><br />Bye the way - do you Guano chomping movie review readers realize that idiot humans are causing the demise of the chiroptera. Stop spelunking!! You are spreading disease & killing off all the Bats. Bats are crucial in the maintenance of a healthy ecosystem.
B008XG1X18|5.0|It's fun and I like to collect items and then go back and look over them.  I have made some new friends in the process.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|Great movie.  Great movie especially if you like Diaz, Phylis Smith from the office, Jason Segal or even Mr. Justin Timberlake.
B002H6ZQRM|4.0|If you enjoyed &#34;Zombieland&#34; or &#34;Dawn of the Dead&#34;, you will like this film. Even if you don't traditionally like zombie films, you will enjoy this one, as it takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to the undead concept. A fun movie.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Purchased this movie because I enjoyed the books.  I thought the portrayals were authentic and  I the storyline followed the book  relatively closely.
B009JBZH54|5.0|All the Christopher Nolan Batman films in one package? A must-have for any film enthusiast. Not only are they fun to watch, but they are masterfully constructed and directed.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|Unemotional and balanced look by a gifted writer.  It was a time of heroes.  We can learn from this book.
B004LWZWGK|4.0|Not the best movie I've ever seen some moments seem to drag for me. Movies are to entertain and dispite some of the dull spots I must say I was entertained. movie arrived in a timley manor,my hats off to the shipper...
1421550644|5.0|The Nausica&auml; is easily one of the best manga I've ever read. It's full of fantastic artwork and amazing characters with a great setting and engaging plot.<br /><br />This release is also exceptional in it's quality, two wonderfully bound hardcover novels in a box. They're heavy and large in size making it extremely easy to read and enjoy. The paper used is quite nice and there are even some maps and full colour images. They even have an appendix featuring multiple pages of sound effect translations. Children will also appreciate the nice poster that it comes with.<br /><br />If you're a fan of Hayao Miyazaki this a must have!
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Good read if you like Reacher - wobbled a bit towards the end!  Not formulaic but close! Slow to start - wobbly middle but not a killer ending! Still good!
B004PVKFR8|5.0|Easily one of my favorite albums of the past few years. Nearly every song stands out on it's own with great vocal, music, and amazing lyrics.
B00A31UXLW|2.0|About halfway through this book, I had to keep reminding myself that it was Harry Bosch and not Jack Reacher about whom I was reading.<br />This was particularly evident when Bosch left LA and drove northwards.<br />Then too his \\"rescue\\"was the most improbable act I had ever read.<br />It was not clear how his \\"rescuer\\"found him, and why did she not bring back up.<br />In spite of all this, it was an entertaining read, provided you put your tongue in your cheek.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Good read and well put together.  Had some trouble putting it down!  Michael Connelly seems to write for my taste!!
B009VL28W2|5.0|I normally dont write reviews but couldn't help with this one.  Out of all of the concerts I have on blu ray this one had the best audio recording.  I relived the experience I had when they were on their Death Magnetic tour in Arizona.
B0088ZSKOC|5.0|every time I have trouble sleeping I play it and have very little if any trouble fallowing.<br />I also have this app on my phone.
B00A77II0U|5.0|The story line and the graphics were great. I love love love when a hidden object game has a pinch zoom in/out for tablets. which makes it more enjoyable.
0525953728|4.0|obviously there are a lot of questions about if writing this book was ethical... without thinking about all of that the book itself is a good, interesting read.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I may be a bit of a horror freak but I love this season so much and can't wait each week to watch the next episode.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I really enjoyed this game and was disappointed when I completed it.  I totally had to cheat, ha.  I hope to come across more like it.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|I wish I had more time to watch this show. From the episodes I have seen, the writing and acting are superb.
0375826742|5.0|Enjoy the book very much. My teenage and preteen children enjoyed it also. They couldn't wait for the next edition.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Wow. This is up there with Breaking Bad for me. The show is so suspenseful and gripping. I wish I could watch the season straight through.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|loves all of the movies. i would love to see the latest one. i like to watch them at home
B002NVTSGQ|5.0|A well crafted show that is relatable on so many levels. Very well written and of course the cast is absolutely phenomenal.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|1st half of the book was extremely slow, lot of wordy gibrish...2nd half picked up and was fairly entertaining in the manner that you would expect from a Patricia Cornwell book.
B008220AVW|5.0|I don't know how good this movie is... it was a gift. But, it did arrive on time exactly as described. I'm sure that it's fine for viewing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|What can we say it over and we want more of Christian and Ana! But I love the little extras in the end of the book! I WANT MORE!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|This version of Angry Birds has some tough levels. It is fun to play. Love the angry birds line of games.
0142410705|3.0|I purchased this for my 13-year old daughter (her name is Katherine, so it struck me as something she might enjoy), but decided to read it first to determine if I felt it was appropriate for her.  I just started it, but I'm annoyed already.  I'll probably have her wait until she is a little older, but personally, I would think she and other kids and young adults would find the author's use of the word \\"fug\\" as a substitute for actual profanity to be inane and annoying.  Either don't use profanity or use the actual word, not some made-up curse.  Are we to believe that an 18-year old says \\"fug\\"?  In real life teens boys are likely going to be profane in their speech, but I don't think anyone would notice the lack of cursing. However, the use of a fake curse draws the reader's attention to it and reminds me that I'm reading a \\"young adult\\" book. I assume that excessive profanity might cause a problem with the book being labelled \\"young adult\\". The use of fug is so patently absurd as to detract from the entire book.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Love this album. Beautiful, soulful songs sung by a very talented musician. This is currently my favorite music to listen to.
B0098VXBIA|3.0|There were parts of this movie that were funny and/or cute but I would not watch it again.  Of course, maybe a mother and/or pregnant woman could relate so much more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show. Was not to sure when I started watching season 1. But it has really grown on me. My favorite show by far.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I use it for reading, relaxing and sleeping. I helps block out my cpap noise with more palatable. Keep up the great work.
B009HELT3C|4.0|this is a pretty good flick. it's got your classic &#34;men in black&#34; laughs. good action sequences. there's a nice touching side to the story as well. i personally think it's a better movie than MIB2. i'd recommend this movie to anyone who likes the MIB franchise, anyone that enjoys a good laugh, and anyone that remotely enjoys a sci-fi flick. however little kids may get a bit freaked out by the villain.
B003M5AXN4|5.0|If you like Mario Kart, Martial Arts, and stuff that is awesome. You will love this movie. I bought it having never seen it and have never looked back. This is a fun, beautiful, action packed movie for the whole family. Do yourself a favor and watch it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked it, a bit sad but worth the read. Both of my children 10/14 read it convinced me to read it too read them all in a 2 day span.
145210655X|5.0|I saw this in the bookstore, sat down on a stool in the isle, and read the whole thing. I was laughing out loud the whole time. The guy looking at graphic novels next to me must have been weirded out. As a long time fan of Star Wars, this book was hilarious. The artwork is fun and well done. Also, you don't have to be a huge nerd to get all the jokes in this book (just some of them!). This is the perfect gift for your slightly grown up Star Wars nerd who now happens to have kids. Buy this! You won't regret it. I've bought 4 so far...and counting.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked it, a bit sad but worth the read. Both of my children 10/14 read it convinced me to read it too read them all in a 2 day span.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!!  The special effects ROCK!!!!!  Being from Abe's home state, I could not pass this one up.
B005ZO6NRA|5.0|My wife enjoyed the movie and liked it better then the older movies. The movie seemed more realistic to the times, and the acting was good. Overall, a great surprise.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|A really interesting and informative account of the capture of Bin Laden, but more so of the intelligence, effort and resilience required of those in the Navy Seals to do the very difficult tasks they are prepared to do.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Great games for kids of all ages (adults included)! It's a &quot;Farmville&quot; wrapped in MLP! While the APP itself is &quot;free&quot; the potential is there to get sucked into to dropping some cash to advance in the game!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I was afraid that season 2 would not be good since they didn't carry on from season 1 but you can't compare the two! Season 2 is a must see! They come up with creepy awesome s***
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|I'm not a huge Shia LaBeouf fan, but really enjoyed this movie.  Actually, watched it a couple of times.  Would recommend.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|I did a lot of research before deciding on this toy. And I'm so happy I did. This toy is adorable, just absolutely adorable. The head of the horse has a bell in it, so it rings when you shake it, the feet are kinda crinkly and have black, red, and white on the bottoms of each hoof. The tail has two knobby rings perfect for them gums. The colors are so bright and fun, it's just perfect. The only complaint I have is that the Knight has a squeaker in his head that is very hard to squeak. But there's so much more going on with this toy that I doubt it really matters. Should I mention that I love the Renfest so this suits my taste like crazy? I can see this being a toy he has until he's much older. <3 it!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My 8-yr old son and I both enjoyed it.  Funny, tender, and the minions are awesome! Gotta watch it before DM2 comes out next summer!
B004LWZWGK|5.0|As with the previous installments, this was wonderfully written and psychologically tense.  The twists kept coming all the way to the end.
B009EAO38C|5.0|The music is fun to listen to, but the videos on their YouTube channel is even better.  The whole family (even the rockers) enjoy watching and listening.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I love this movie.  A must have movie.  A must see for those who have not seen it. Wonderful movie.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|If you don't mind being sexually aroused this book ... I knew nothing about, I read it in three days. I could not put it down. I am beginning the second book now. It is about two gals, who meet 2 brothers where money is not a problem. One of the girls is experiencing sex in an unusual way.<br />Follow her as she learns about herself and boyfriend
0385344228|5.0|Could not put the book down and thought about it when I wasn't reading it! The style is interesting and leads one to question what is really going on early on in the story! The ending was a twist and a surprise. Can't wait to get to book club!
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Such an awe inspiring read. I can't wait to go for a run in the morning! ThAt was poetry in motion.
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I absolutely loved the walking dead. I've watched it around 20 times and I still never get sick of it. I've already ordered and paid for season 3. Waiting in anticipation for it to come out.
B004C3DLJS|4.0|Well-developed story line with humor for adults and children.  The only downside was the sound quality.  I played it on my computer and even with the volume all the way up, it was too quiet.  I haven't had that issue with other movies from Amazon.com.
B002VECM4A|5.0|This film was magnificent. Brilliant storyline and the acting was superb. I shed a few tears while watching it and I love the ending.
B0055PGUYU|3.0|The book Defines the habit process well and how you can manipulate it to change or create new habits. The later part of the book is a bit more bland and less practical.
B009PU2SX8|5.0|Truly an inspirational artist. Gary and his band are all over the place on this Album Grindy hard hitting guitar riffs and sweet rhythm and blues. Nice work Mr Clark!
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|This book is really funny. howver it is VERY short. i finished it in a night. after that i had nothing to read. if i were you i would go and get a book that is just as funny, but longer.
B001HC8516|5.0|Fantastically funny book. It certainly helped me get over a break up. These guys really make it short and sweet.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|this is super entertaining and even shows the pigs side of the angry bids story. this is very fun, and i think (for me) it's more fun than angry birds
B000056BOR|5.0|I love everything Doris Day, this has always been a favorite. Especially because Cary Grant is in it! I completely adore the cast! It's just an amazing movie.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|Once more, Howard Shore shows that he is a genius and one of the best composers in the world. Amazing. Words are not enough to describe the quality of this work.

B0002F6BRE|5.0|A really hilarious movie, fun for the whole family! Will Ferrell in his best role yet! I watch it every year around this time! :)
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Every song on this album is good.  I can't stop listening to it.  Great variety of songs too!  This is only their first album so I can't wait to see what they put out next.

B000W178XO|4.0|This album is a compilation of almost all of Johnny Cash's greatest and most well known songs.  I feel like I have discovered even some of his songs that I have heard before, but didn't listen to the lyrics or the mood of the song.  They are great!<br /><br />If you don't have an extensive Johnny Cash collection, make sure to add this one to it!
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Good show!!!!!!! The best i have seen must see, n quality its really good,the action its really intense yea ....
B009CPEOC4|2.0|My wife and I felt more sad for her as we watched this behind the scenes view of her tour and the songs that she sang on stage.  If you're a big KP fan, then maybe you will like it a lot more.
B008M87GJK|4.0|As an expat living in the US and a (male) news addict it is refreshing to get the 'almost' unbiased news from a reputable source.<br />The app appears to work at least as well as the other news apps that are out there.<br />If you must have news, as I do, it will sometimes open your eyes to a more objective view than most people here may be used to from the major news channels here.<br />I particularly like the option to have automatic updates at regular intervals unlike some other apps which require you to update on opening. Whether that will be a battery issue will have to be seen.
B008UUPOVM|4.0|Owl City returns with a really good album.  The songs are catchy, it's more of a return to the first mainstream album's roots.  I didn't much like the other recent album with Alligator Sky, but this one has grown on me the more that I play it.  Great for an afternoon at work when you're struggling to stay awake and need that jolt of fun energy!
B002RKSXJG|5.0|If you need to accomplish something important or sleep in the next few days, then don't read this book.  Despite its length, the book hooks your attention and does not let go.  This book works great as an ebook.  A very satisfying read.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. No problems at all downloading or using. Only one ad comes up prior to being able to play the game.
1451638450|4.0|It's been a long time coming for Bujold fans, but Ivan Vorpatril finally gets his own book. We always suspected there was more to Ivan than meets the eye, and Bujold's strong characterizations come to the fore here. The plot itself seems more of a stage on which to watch the characters, but her characters are strong and rich, as is the setting of the Vorkosigan-verse. These strengths make it easy to overlook the plot (which seems like an after-thought, sketchily painted in so as not to detract from the actors on the stage.)<br />This is not a book for those who are new to the Vorkosigan series--too much is left unexplained, so only those who already know Ivan and Barrayar will really &#34;get&#34; what is happening here. But the galactic traveler who has passed through Barrayar multiple times will welcome another chance to meet old friends and catch up on their latest life events.<br />Bujold doesn't disappoint--Ivan's story is great fun, and brings to light some background to other characters and situations. There's nothing ground-breaking or deathly serious here (other than marriage and the troubles it can bring to a young Vor officer),  but as a light, comedy-of-manners, this novel works just fine.

B001HN6EF4|5.0|Great product !!! Very happy with the purchase.<br />Quick shipping. I always wanted a pair of UNO to take anywhere and this is it.
B0087GYY92|3.0|Scalzi almost ties himself in knots here trying to justify a loopy concept, but he just about succeeds and the results are entertaining if not up to his usual high standards. There's humour and occasional poignancy as the redshirts attempt to escape their pre-ordained fate. A light read but enough good ideas to be worth it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you haven't heard of the piano guys, go check out their YouTube channel right now. Then come back here and buy this.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I admit that I got this Omnibus because of the price, & figured I could delete it if it sucked, having never heard of 'WOOL' before.  OMG was I wrong!  This series kept me hooked from page 1 of book 1 until the last page of book 5!  The devious mind who thought this up should be complimented on the continuity of the series as well as the complexity.<br />I really like hi-tech and military sci-fi as my favorites, But I was intrigued enough to try this. This is a series for Sci-Fi readers and those who like mystery, suspense, adventure, and even some small bit of romance.  The character development of the main personas was very good, the details of the 'silo' world were great(especially once you understood what it really was!) Even the 'remnant-tech' of the series kept me interested as bright minds figured out new ways to repair and re-use items.<br />I can't wait for more books about this world!!  Write/publish more soon (Pleease...)
B005723JSQ|5.0|After reading a very clever, funny novel in this genre [[ASIN:1460985826 My Life on Craigslist: Award Winning Finalist of USA Book Awards]](great book, I highly recommend it) I realized that this genre is more interesting than I had previously thought from my literary ivory tower. So I decided to try the queen of chicklit, Sophie Kinsella, and see what the fuss and sales are all about. This book is lighter, the humor everywhere, impeccably done in every sentence, and although the characters are a bit unidimensional and the plot slightly predictive, it is nevertheless charming and a page turner. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a fun read.
B0027VTMAE|5.0|It's great to see Johnny Depp's acting chops as a character in a serious movie full of suspense, not sillyness.  Music sound track is also great.

Hard not to love it. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a fun read. And who doesn't?
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I waited for the dvd to come out to watch this Batman movie. I had surgery when it came out and then I waited too because I like to use the captions since, with my hearing impairment, it's easier for me to understand the masked characters with subtitles. I enjoyed the movie and am glad we added it to our collection.

This book is lighter, the premise is interesting, many people already described it here, and the humor is everywhere, in every sentence, and situation, sometimes downright silly, but I didn't mind it, I actually enjoyed it, like chopstick comedy. It's pure fun and  a page turner. I highly recommend this book!
B003Z0BWRM|3.0|My friend put me on to this book and i decided to read it. It wasn't the kind of book that i HAD to read in my point of view but it was alright. I've always loved monster and faerie type books but this is definitely not the best one i've read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The Kindle Fire HD is such an awesome little machine - I can't understand why such an iconic app like Facebook is such a poor performer!  It truly sucks, for lack of a better word!  Problem is just as the other reviewers have stated, only about 10-12 status posts come up, below that 4-5 text only posts...that's it, nothing else....so frustrating! I love every other aspect and use that I have found for my new Kindle Fire HD 8.9, but still have to use my Android phone if I want to peruse my Facebook account.  Please, please, please....someone figure this out and fix it....I don't care, charge me, I'll pay, I just want to be able to pull up Facebook on my Kindle Fire and have it work like it should!
B002RI9S2Y|5.0|I decided to read this after i watched the movie and i loved it instantly. ever since i've bought it i've felt like i've had to read the next one in the series as soon as i put the last one down. This has become one of my favourite books very quickly! Cheers to Rick Riordan for his masterpiece! I love it!
B009HEMW4W|5.0|In my opinion the best of the men in black movies, I especially like to J to K tie in at the last of the movie.

B0083J8NFY|3.0|This was probably 1 of the most ambitious book I have read in awhile.  It was 900+ pages long.<br />It kept my attention but in the end a lot of things were left unexplained.  Or it they were explained I didn't understand them.<br />It does keep your attention but figure several hours to read.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Susan's first album was good but not great. It was &#34;safe,&#34; featuring many of the gospel songs that she was comfortable with. Her second album was awful (with the exception of &#34;I Reach for Your Hand,&#34; which was magnificent); whoever produced that album should be fired. Not a song on there took advantage of her ability to summon the power her voice. This album, however, is great,<br /><br />In her audition with &#34;Britain's Got Talent&#34; Susan said she wanted to be like Elaine Paige. This album fulfills that ambition. Each song takes advantage of her vocal range. While (in m y opinion) none of the songs has the power of &#34;I Dreamed a Dream&#34; or &#34;I Reach for Your Hand,&#34; all together this is a wonderful and enjoyuable album that can be listened to many times.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|My 11 year old enjoyed reading this book.  I would recommend it at that age level as she liked it
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book is great reading, and one I intend over Christmas to put to good use.  I like the one it is presented and can't wait to try out the after effects of trying to get rid of my wheat belly.
B005LAIIS0|3.0|> I bought this on Black Friday sale for $7.99 and would have returned it had it not been for the 5.99 Return/Shipping Fee.Despite the cheap price please avoid this version so the studio can pump out a improved scale release.I spent some time tweaking of my Sony XBR909 LCD w/LED Backlighting and I could not get a 'BluRay\\" quality picture. The blacks are grainy and lines are blurred.Whites are washed out and facial detail is non existent also there is pixilating sky panning. What I hoped would be beautiful winter scenery contrast against a grim situation storyline became a difficult to appreciate disappointment.<br />3.5 Stars for movie 0 Stars for transfer.
B005J4VV28|4.0|This is the BEST release of these cartoons I've yet been able to find. After buying several different DVD-R versions of this old series over the years (since there are NO \\"official authorized releases\\") I find this ACME version to be the most complete & over-all best.<br /><br />The quality varies from quite good to excellent from volumes 1 thru 4. Volume 5 looks like it was transferred from analog to digital using lower-grade, but passable, methods.<br /><br />With each episode [as other reviewers wrote] you get a 2 cartoons with 2 sing-a-longs between them.<br /><br />Volume 2 has the original \\"Show Lead-In\\" that is missing on volume 1.<br /><br />Volume 3 has the original \\"Show Lead-In\\" and \\"Exit\\".<br /><br />Volume 5 has some of the \\"link\\" segments and 1 \\"preview for next week\\".<br /><br />Even though actual Beatles songs were used in this series, I've also long seen why any ex-Beatles and related people would have disliked it because of it's extra cheesey-ness and the way it portrays it's \\"cartoon Ringo Starr\\" as a total buffoon, which the real Richard Starkey is NOTHING like that, it would still be nice to have a full-quality \\"authorized\\" release someday.<br /><br />Many of the people involved in this show's original production also made the more accepted & famous \\"Yellow Submarine\\". So anyway...
B006O6F932|5.0|My eight year old just loves this toy. She takes it out every day to play with (she even decorated it for Christmas). I love the fact it folds up and stores away, but it's big enough for her to use in so many ways. I was surprised myself how big it opened up. Great toy, and so far it's holding up to a lot of play time.
1932100660|4.0|I am halfway through this book.  It had been recommended to me by a friend.  The friend follows the Plant-based Diet.  I find it very helpful & it gives me more support to continue with a Plant-based diet.

B003UESJHE|5.0|The King's Speech (Blu-ray). The acting and the movie are superb. I appreciated the history lesson and learning what happened after the war.
B005LAIHCM|1.0|The ONLY thing House at the End of the Street has to offer is an attractive cast, that's absolutely it. Other than that this film is incredibly boring and filled with bad plot holes. Bottom of the barrel horror that's for sure. AVOID.
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Great Game and works flawlessly. All AI games work flawlessly and have all the features you need to play for house on a plane or sitting waiting for a train.
0979019710|5.0|Hal is spot on in this book and more importantly, I have seen him live it AND teach it to so many around the world. Awesome to see that enough people have begged him to write this book and that he took the time to share it in an easy to follow format that is now accessible to the masses. Few will have the courage to follow these basic principles but those that do will never be the same.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Crazy out there, never would have checked this out with out a recommendation from someone else.  If you like quirky and out there this was a fun read.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Much of the material in the second part of the book - the lessons the author brought back with her from her Near Death Experience - is familiar to me from years of reading in metaphysics and the mystical traditions of many faiths.  However, she expresses these lessons in clear, comprehensive and approachable langauge, making them more easily understandable for any reader.  I found this book to be an inspirational reminder of the light we all carry inside us, and how we can relax into letting it shine through us, leading us into healing in many areas of our lives.
0783225482|5.0|If you like the actors in this movie it is worth buying. Very funny!<br />The quality of the DVD is outstanding, packed very well so it could not be damaged in shipping.

B002SEQ8ZM|5.0|the cards are fabulous! and the dvd is awesome! i havent seen coraline yet, since its for christmas, but this is such an awesome gift for someone who hasnt seen the movie. NOT recommended for under 10. yes this is a childs movie, but its a tad dark. my mother told me i needed to get the movie since i liked nightmare before christmas.<br /><br />honestly it is a tad 'dark' JUST like nightmare before christmas, BUT my 2 year old and 5 year old sat through it just fine with no nightmares. my 2 year old girl really really enjoyed the movie and wanted to watch it 2x in a row!<br /><br />i liked it, storyline was well thought out, movie was perfect, box set is great for people who loved the movie and want some extra tidbits.<br /><br />no, i have not seen the 3D version of the movie, i was nervous about my 2year old seeing the hands reaching for her, but maybe next year we can try that.<br /><br />pros: awesome<br />great story<br />awesomely weird animation<br />interesting<br />great box set<br />great gift!<br /><br />cons: nothing. super happy!
B003NX75B8|4.0|I love so many quotes from this book. It was funny but also deep. I need to read it again so I can understand everything.
1423140605|5.0|I bought this for my daughter for christmas, and its in excellant shape. I personally do not read this, so I cannot comment on the book itself, but she says it's a great book. It belongs to a series.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Excellently crafted visual version of the original book.  Violence and sex scenes could have been a bit less graphic than shown.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like it but almost all the way through. would be nice to have more puzzles that arecon the free levels
B005LAIIS0|1.0|Liam Neeson does take on the occasional turkey of a role and this one is certainly a prize winner in that category.<br /><br />The film is completely unrealistic and beyond boring.<br /><br />The special effects are like from the dollar store. In one scene, the eyes of the wolf pack lighting up is laughable as they look exactly like a bunch of lights. They are all exactly spaced apart perfectly with the same amount of light \\"reflected\\" in their eyes. Just eyes, no wolves.<br /><br />So many stupid moments, like let's all sleep inside the plane wreckage but leave one guy outside in the arctic weather as a \\"lookout\\". A lookout for what?<br /><br />Then of course there is the classic \\"Let's move to the trees because the wolves don't want us here\\" line, which should haunt Mr. Neeson for the rest of his career.<br /><br />I could spend two hours lampooning this film scene by scene but why bother?<br /><br />Avoid watching this loser unless you see if for free and have absolutely nothing else to do, as it is a total waste of time.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Oh Piano Guys!!  I am so glad I found you on You Tube and have downloaded your music.  Not just talented but obviously extremely commited to your craft. If you love instrumental music that does not get boring with repeated listening, you will LOVE the Piano Guys.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I fully enjoyed this book. Not only was it an interesting story, the author did a great job of making zoological and religious topics a major part of the story. I learned a lot about zookeeping, Islam and Hinduism. I highly recommend this book. I was almost disappointed when it was done because I wanted more.
B000UPGQQW|5.0|Well worth owning. Got here on time well packed.<br />If u love vampire movies then this movie for u.<br />Great price as well.

B000002KYR|5.0|Well, it's about time that I review Eliminator; why wouldn't a ZZ Top fan eventually make time for this classic album? While some purists shun the era that began with Deguello and ended with the transitional Recycler, I on the other hand loved this era of Top's legendary career. Yes, they wanted more exposure, and with the advent of MTV, they had the perfect medium to sell millions of records. This Diamond certified album has it all; it has blues and boogie, gravelly vocals, and rattling guitar. The songs are more diverse than one would assume if they only listened to the radio hits, such as SHARP DRESSED MAN, GIMME ALL YOUR LOVIN', and LEGS. There are several stellar tracks that unfortunately never measured up to radio-friendly status, such as THUG, BAD GIRL, I NEED YOU TONIGHT, and I GOT THE SIX. All in all, this record appeals to a diverse audience for the most part, as the blues are infused into radio-friendly songs with synthesizers thrown in. I give these guys credit for creating a great record while putting their roots and reputation on the line. There's plenty to like here. Believe it or not, my favorite album from this era is the heavier and transitional Recycler with the very important song 2000 Blues, which was the start of them reverting back to their roots. Still, Eliminator is a great release.
6305428042|5.0|Witches hallowen and all kids of fun. Got<br />Here on time well pack. Ment for kids but fun<br />For everyone.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|Immediately after seeing this film in the dollar theatres I pre-ordered my own copy. It is just a fantastic movie.<br />The script is great. It's mostly just funny but also has a great moral lesson to it - one that is not shoved down your throat but instead told naturally in accordance with the plot. Besides the spoken humor, the movie has hilarious visual gags like the scene where Norman fights to retrieve the book from his dead uncle's clutched hands - sure to make anyone laugh.<br />This movie comes from Laika, the studio who made Coraline (another classic). And let me tell you, Laika is an innovative powerhouse. Why? Take a look at Norman's ears! Or Neil's freckles! I would love to know how they made the skin so realistic. The ears are somewhat translucent, just like real life. This is a detail, that from my recollection, has never been put in any stop motion film. I guess I'm kinda a nerd for noticing that, but wow.<br />In general, I am amazed by stop motion considering how much time and effort must go into creating just a few seconds of film. So while I'm a sucker for anything stop motion animated, I still believe this is a movie that could please anyone, it's just too funny. I hope this wins for Best Animated Picture. There hasn't been another animated movie this year that comes close to this. If it goes to Brave then the Oscars might as well be the Grammys.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very good app<br />this is one of the best apps yet!!!!  I love this app, I will definitely recommend this app to friends.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|I love Deepak Chopra's messages. This book was very easy to read and I was finished rather quickly. It's the kind of book you can read again and again to put into practice his common sense strategies for living a successful life. While the book is spiritual, it's actually very realistic and practical just as the title eludes. Highly recommend for anyone looking to improve their situation or live a happier life.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Started slow and sped up till it was compelling! Great humor and drama as well as follow up at the end. A MUST READ!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have been following The Piano Guys on YouTube for a while now and I am so excited that they are finally releasing CDs! They are very talented and are so enjoyable to listen to and watch live - if you ever get the opportunity. My parents love them and even my 5-year-old niece asks to listen to them. It is excellent for any age and not your typical \\"classical\\" music. Keep 'em coming and I will keep buying them!
B003O86FMW|5.0|My daughter loved it. Gave up TV, etc to read it.  She can't wait for the movie to come out.
B00005JO20|1.0|We were very disappointed with this movie. Our grandsons love the old version and I had no idea within the first five min. it was strong language like &#34;GD&#34;. We are careful about what we watch and threw the movie in the trash. I feel the movie did not benefit from using foul language but then we feel this way across the board. I assumed the rating was due to violence or little scary for young children.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|All the hits and more in one set. Made a wonderful birthday gift for a hard to buy for person.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. However, I do not give it five stars because I think that Pixar had done a better job with other movies. Highly recommended for families.
B005KDWUG4|3.0|The video quality is grainy. Poor lighting which is oftentimes disruptive. There is a spotlight on the left side of the stage that would blind your focus every now and then. The Barcelona concert is far better. They are all great singers and that is undeniable. The style though is very predictable. Too much histrionics. I wonder why it was filmed 1080i not 1080p.
0545265355|3.0|The price was good and the books kept me reading, but I didn't really care for it.  I thought the writing was unimaginative, especially in the naming of people and places.  I know many who love this series, but I don't know that I'll ever read it again.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. This is the third Jodi Picoult I've read (The Pact/Keeping Faith) and I've loved them all. It's so sad how hard growing up can be for some kids. And it's ridiculous how so many bullies don't understand the damage they are creating.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I saw this in the theater with my grandaughter and her family. we all really enjoyed it! I am so excited to get this to watch over and over, with her again or even by myself.
0375413405|5.0|This classic work is a must for any (semi) serious home cook's kitchen library.  The old style type set and layout is charming and the recipes and descriptions clear and entertaining to read.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Beautiful hair and beautiful story! Shows the problems between Mothers and daughters can be worked out, with no help from the naked little bears-she loved that part.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys have always been a part of my life ever since my brother showed me the Jarrod Radnich \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" Theme Song. I've seen their videos, and listened to their music, and let me tell you, their professional quality coupled with their willingness to have a bit of fun sets them a tier above any other music I've ever heard.
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I love this movie! It is part action, part love story. I highly recommend it. Definitely will watch again & again.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I've never played this before and I'm having a lot of fun moving through the stages.  I think I will buy the full version when I'm done with this one.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Very disappoint for this book<br />GRRM has no  ideal how to make book interesting so he kill every main character.<br />Why do you hate Stark Har GRRM?<br /><br />Any way in this book you found the character you use to read in the 3 book again but they do nothing just eating  taking walking<br /><br />It wast of time to read this book.if you have something to do do not buy it.But if you have vast of time or have habit to read someone diary this book is ok
0812993292|5.0|I recommend this book to the long married and to those struggling for meaning in a relationship.<br />It is quirky but full of insight and truth.
B003VANOFY|4.0|I would give this 3.5 if possible. I have issues with it dropping connection occasionally (Only happened twice so far) even though it's fully charged. The headset itself is rather bulky and a bit too large for my head. I have it adjusted as low as possible and it still slides around on my head (which is admittedly pretty big). I also don't like the size of the adapter. It's RF only so no micro BT adapters will work. Other than that, it works well and the 7.1 surround sound gimmick actual sounds great.<br /><br />I've edited this review to say that the battery life has proven to be great. It seems to have an incredibly long standby time.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|You can't determine the power of the launch but figuring the angle of the shot is interesting. An enjoyable way to waste a few minutes.
0312360266|4.0|Let me first start off by saying that I like this book.I was surpried that I liked it cause I'm more of a dystopian book girl like The Hunger Games and Divergent. At first I didn't wanna read it cause this was compared to twilight and I don't like Twilight but they are different. It's a lot more better then twilight, however I do like this book but the bad things are the following: there are 12 books in total and only 10 are out right now,also it's a little nasty and when I mean nasty I mean inappropriate and they swear a lot and use god's names in vein so if that doesn't bother you then your fine, and lastly the characters seem shallow for that is why I gave this a 4 star....but it's so unlike anything I have read. If you like romance,high school drama,and vampires that have some kind of powers then this book is for you. So I guess I kinda fall into that category.
B005LAII12|5.0|Raunchy, yes. Inappropriate, yes. Hilarious, yes! Right after my husband and I watched this, he said he'd watch all over again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could only lay it down when my eyes got too tired to go on.  One of the best books ever.
030758836X|5.0|Shared with all the women in my family. Everyone loved it. Grabs you from page one and keeps you guessing through the very last sentence on the final page. Bought for Kindle and will never delete.
B00005N6KG|5.0|This little earphone is so amazing so much power is withheld in a small speaker. The reason for me buying one more of these  earphones is because of mistreatment to the previous one which i am using which has a short in the wire. Greatest earphone for the greatest price and one final thing i have never gone wrong with Sony.
B009K45Y62|5.0|It was nice to receive it after all, I like the bat cowl and how it sits right now on the top of my computer table. The Dark knight fans will love this for sure. You'll find the DVDs case at the back of it, could've done a better job with the casing though because it feels so light and it might break after opening it and closing it again and again.<br /><br />I don't need to talk about the movie here which was to me great and they could not do more than that to end the trilogy. I know people were expecting more, but it Trilogy reached the climax on the second part (The Dark Knight) and they can't keep going like that also with the final movie (otherwise how would it end?)
159420411X|5.0|Well written.  Advanced our knowledge about the frailties and successes of making predictions and forecasts.  Silver has become a leading and trusted authority in this field.
0812550706|5.0|I have read this book 3 times now and it always gives me something, the characters come alive in my head.
B00526ZKYS|2.0|I was disappointed with the ending of this book...  The concept was good but the ending left you hanging and left a lot of questions.............

B005IQ39AY|5.0|excellent game play again.<br />if I had to play this game while working I would not get anything done someone would fire me.
B009VB97EY|2.0|The dancing was real nice but the story was a little corny. Typical stripper story, a stripper, stripping until they can save money to do what they really want to do.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I picked this rating because of the complete and interesting story line.  The middle of the book was a little laborious. The ending was excellent and thought out.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Our family loves the Piano Guys! This album has surpassed our expectations. Every song is a joy and lightens our soul. My thirteen year old son says when he listens to the Piano Guys it helps his day go better. That alone makes this album priceless.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|It was ok that's why I rated it an 3 star book. I don't  like it because its a little confusing!!!!!And its kind of weird!!!!:(
B008AK8FHM|3.0|I like the way it is written, but I thought I would get more information that what is actually revealed.

0345803485|2.0|I've read the entire series now. It took me two months, and I'm an avid and quick reader - some moments were so boring I nearly fell asleep.<br /><br />The BDSM scenes, although titillating, are not an accurate representation of BDSM. The relationship between Anastasia and Christian, though interesting to read about at times, is abusive and kind of scary. And the plot that E.L. James tries to force inbetween sex scenes is boring, uninspired, and often incredibly shallow.<br /><br />Ana is slightly better than the character that inspired her, (Bella Swan of Twilight), but not by much. Although she occasionally puts her foot down and stands up to Christian when he's being abusive, it doesn't happen often enough. She lets Christian stalk her, intimidate her (outside of BDSM scenes), and dictate what she can and cannot do, right down to the friends she's allowed to associate with. Despite a troubling trend in recent popular literature, this is NOT what love looks like, nor is it an accurate representation of what a healthy, productive BDSM relationship looks like.<br /><br />This series is good for one thing - testing the waters around BDSM. If the kink scenes in this story interest you, it may benefit you to look for other resources and information about it. But do not, under any circumstances, walk away from this series assuming that this is the safest, most emotionally healthy way to conduct this sort of relationship. It's far from it. If you find yourself interested, please do your research before attempting any scenes of your own - for your safety and the safety of your partner.<br /><br />Ultimately, I give this book 2/5 stars because of its inaccuracy, its frightening and positive portrayal of an abusive relationship, and its incredibly boring and uninspired scenes about the mundane aspects of Christian and Ana's life. It earned two stars based on the fact that it is a decent starting point for testing the waters around interest in BDSM, though it is not an accurate guide to the realities of that type of a relationship, and because a few of the sex scenes were actually quite good.<br /><br />However, there are dozens of better erotic novels about BDSM out there, and hundreds of manuals too. Invest in some of those and save yourself the ten dollars.<br /><br />(If you're looking for some of those resources, google &#34;Laci Green 50 Shades of WTF&#34; and watch her video on YouTube. She gives an excellent rundown of the series and offers some great advice for beginners of kink as well.)
030758836X|2.0|Warning: The characters were very unlikable! And, the author takes her time to peel back the complex layers of their personalities. The book is organized in a diary format and jumps back and forth in time. (I read this on a Kindle app, so it was hard to go back to a previous chapter to review an earlier entry.) Even though some chapters were overly drawn out, some element compelled me to keep on reading, so I have to give credit to the author for being able to accomplish that. Sadly, the ending confirmed that the book was a waste of my time! In summary, the story sucked, but the author was clever in the construction of it.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|Many stories lines running concurrent, but all related.  Difficult to not skip ahead, but if you do, a must to go back for the details
B0069UP2PI|5.0|So real, scary, precise , and great performances from the cast. Beware, the person standing next to you on the train coughing may be spreading the next virus to wipe out the human race :/. Great movie
B006SMLAMQ|1.0|This app.looked like a great 1 then when I downloaded it it wouldn't let you change the city or state for the correct weather.Horrible app.then when I emailed customer service about this app I got no response!!I wouldn't reccomend it
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We downloaded the music to the hard drive in our SUV. Everytime we go somewhere, the children want to listen to \\"The Piano Guys\\". Not only is the music relaxing and even inspirational, but it is put together by extremely talented and creative musicians! Can't wait to hear more CDs from the Piano Guys in the future! :)
0307352145|4.0|This book will provide encouragement and reassurance for anyone who is in school or starting out in a career and is worried that their introversion is going to doom them. Cain provides plenty of evidence for the advantages of being and introvert, ways to overcome it when need be, and examples of lots of successful introverts. The book basically says to make use of the advantages being an introvert provides--such as not making hasty, bad decisions or losing your temper during a tough negotiation.<br /><br />One weakness of the book is that Cain, an introvert herself, writes with a bias toward introversion from the book's beginning. This lessens the impact of some of the scientific and anecdotal evidence she presents to show the differences between introverts and extroverts. Another problem that I had personally with the book was her treatment of Dale Carnegie. In Chapter 1, she puts some of the blame for our society's bias toward extroversion on Carnegie and his teachings. However, although she attends several programs in the course of writing the book (such as a Tony Robbins seminar), she didn't take a Carnegie class. As an extreme introvert, my personal experience taking a Carnegie class 25 years ago was that it certainly wasn't intended to turn introverts into extroverts or even to get them to act like extroverts most of the time. Instead, it was intended to teach some simple truths about public speaking and interacting with other people. The most important of those truths were:<br /><br />- When you are speaking in front of an audience, the audience is not your adversary. Think about when you are in the audience and the speaker is having difficulty. It is a painful experience to sit through. Nearly everyone in the audience wants the speaker to do well.<br />- When you are talking about something you care about and know well, you won't have difficulty telling someone, even a large audience, about it. Cain gives lots of examples in the book about introverts overcoming their introversion when speaking about subjects they care deeply about. This is one of the lessons Dale Carnegie taught me. Again, think about your bad experiences speaking to a crowd in school. You were probably assigned to speak on a subject you didn't care much about--maybe a book you didn't want to read or some European royalty you had never heard of. No wonder you had difficulty! But if the teacher had asked you to speak about baseball or your favorite author or your dog or whatever you were passionate about, you would have found yourself speaking without a lot of difficulty.<br /><br />I went into the Dale Carnegie class as a complete cynic, sent there by my company because someone probably decided my ability to interact with people didn't match up to the technical ability which had rapidly advanced me to a management position. What my company didn't know was that all through school and even into college, I suffered from severe stuttering. I was absolutely terrified to speak before a group. But in the Carnegie class, surrounded by others who shared some of my problems, I was able to overcome my fears. Because Carnegie let us choose our topics, and placed an emphasis on short impromptu speeches each week as well, I had lots of opportunities to talk about things that interested me. For my longest speech, I even felt comfortable enough to talk about a period in my life when my Father and I went several years without speaking and the incident that finally resolved the separation. When I was given the top award (voted by my classmates) at the end of the course, it was truly one of the proudest moments in my life.<br /><br />25 years later, I am still an introvert who doesn't care much about going to parties and is likely to stand in the corner by myself if I can't find a kindred spirit to latch onto. But in my work, I am confident in my ability and never feel any hesitation or have any difficulty in speaking my mind to the top executives in the large multinational company I work for. And I feel that I have Dale Carnegie to thank for a lot of this. It was truly a class that changed my life.<br /><br />So excuse me for the rant, but I do wish Cain had done a little more investigation before she wrote the part of her book about Carnegie. I'm not sure Carnegie and Tony Robbins would have gotten along at all.<br /><br />In any case, this comes near the beginning of the book, and it is a measure of Cain's success that by the end of the book, I had forgiven her and appreciated all the research she had done and the way she had conveyed it in a slightly disorganized, but easy-to-digest style in this book. I would especially recommend it to mixed introvert/extrovert couples or to parents with an introvert child that they want to understand better.
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This was a very cute movie.  It was just perfect for our decorating the tree night.  It was fun for kids and adults and had a nice little lesson/message too.
B009CPES4I|4.0|Not necessarily a must see, but the acting and story were good, in particular Dev Patel as Sonny, the hotel owner and Judi Dench as Evelyn.
B008M4MB8K|5.0|Blade Runner is the greatest movie ever made. I made that statement 25 years ago in film school and became an instant pariah with the Eraser Head click. Didn't care then and still don't. The Final cut is my favorite cut of my favorite movie. You can watch this film dozens of times and still find new things. I've seen it over a 100 times on VHS, DVD and now I can't wait to see it again on Blu-ray on my new HD TV. If you only have 1 movie in your blu-ray collection - make it this one.

B003L77G06|5.0|I am assuming I'm commenting on the delivery and quality of the set and not the fact that I love this show?  lol.  I wouldnt have purchased it if I didn't love it in the first place. This was the best price we could find by far.  Arrived quickly and packaged well.
1594203334|5.0|This book was pivotal in helping my new grandaughter sleep through the night - need I say more?  Get this book if you are a new parent!
B005LAJ16I|5.0|From the opening scene there was intensity and intrigue, and from that point forward, it only got better.  The suspense and curiosity drives you almost to the limit of your endurance--you want to know the truth right now!  But, you know that with patience you will be rewarded with, not only some revelations, but with at least a modicum of understanding about how and why the characters are as they are.  And what's more, there seems to be no shortage of surprises.  Like, who knew?  Right?  I can barely wait for season two!<br /><br />And, last, but not least, if I may offer a shameless plug, the retailer from whom I purchased Season One, Treasure Gully, is about as good as they come.  I had a slight problem with the product and they immediately addressed it to my complete satisfaction.
0553801473|5.0|A Dance with Dragons (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 5) What a book! What a series! Read the series from the start.

B0076DELIG|4.0|I read all of Michael Connelly's books, and I especially like the Harry Bosch series. This book is another in a long line of winners, although the usual formula of Harry bucking the powers that be, breaking the rules and maybe the law, all in the pursuit of justice for the victim, can get repetitive.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Great book! I have really enjoyed this series. It's nice for light and just interesting enough to read before bed
B008XX6J4C|5.0|the piano guys are amazing. they are so creative! I love their music and I would recommend it to anyone. I love this album
B00656C6KK|5.0|A nice surprise!  I'm a year late to the game but really enjoy the music.  Arrangements are classic.  Thanks for finding and issuing the treasure.  This is a thoughtfully designed album of selections chosen to reveal a story-line and philosophy of life.  Most, if not all, of the songs have difficult melody lines.  The lyrics are extremely well-written, some complex, profound, fun. Ms. Day reveals an unusual talent for jazz that is a bit more intellectual than most of her more well-known singing.  Only a few other contemporary singers have this rare gift for voice phrasing, tempo, and dynamics.  It is also an emotional experience for listening.  Highly romantic at times but also reflective, sorrowful, and finally, joyful.  I've listened three times through and will just about ready to conclude the album is nothing shy of brilliant.  Be warned, this is not pop music.  In the past few years, I've purchased other Day CDs and this one is unique.

B004UQPM4E|3.0|[[ASIN:B004UQPM4E Superman: The Motion Picture Anthology, 1978-2006 [Blu-ray]]]Well, I purchased this item almost a year ago. I know this is a long time to go between getting an item and writing a review. I recently ordered the Harry potter collection off of Amazon UK. I thought it was such a great deal that I thought I would take a look at price differences on other box sets. When I came to The Superman Anthology I noticed a disclaimer that stated Amazon wasn't selling the item anymore because of some sort of issue with the product. Basically you pay for the US version and you receive the cheaper region free version. Well this happened to me... This was just one of those impulse buys for me a year ago that immediately went on my shelf unopened. After discovering this issue I went and checked and sure enough I had the region free version. I don't mind that. They are the same as far as I know. What pisses me off is that I payed $75.00 for it. I contacted Amazon customer support and was offered a 50-60% refund. It was a nice gesture but, if I were to take the refund it would just about cover the cost of buying another region free set off of Amazon UK lol. No point really. I asked for a credit for the difference and was denied. If you want this Item I would suggest either trying to find it in store and paying the $75/$85 for the US version or just buying the Region free version directly from Amazon UK.<br /><br />http://www.amazon.co.uk/Complete-Superman-Collection-Blu-ray-Region/dp/B004MYF6YK/ref=sr_1_1?s=dvd&ie=UTF8&qid=1355304256&sr=1-1<br /><br />I may shell out another $75 if I find it in a store somewhere and can see with my own eyes it's the US version before I pay for it but I will not attempt to buy it online again. I haven't watched any of them yet but from what I can tell it's the same exact stuff just in a different package and the printing on the discs are different. If anyone knows otherwise please comment because I would like to know. I know it's my fault for not noticing/understanding the difference when I purchased this anthology a year ago. If I would have caught it then I could have easily returned it and gotten a full refund. It's too late for me to leave seller feedback but shame on the seller: \\"Uplifting Deals\\" for deceiving people like that. Who's the goose? I AM!<br /><br />EDIT: After my initial contact with Amazon customer support live chat last night, I received an email today asking if my problem was solved. I replied with a no and was asked for a second chance to try to solve my problem. I wrote my issue down in the comments section and sent it. about 20 minutes later Amazon replied with the following:<br /><br />\\"Hello,<br /><br />Thanks for contacting us back in this regard.<br /><br />I'm so sorry to hear your \\"Superman: The Motion Picture Anthology, 1978-2006 [Blu-ray]\\" arrived doesn't meet your expectations.

To accept this refund, let us know and we'll issue the refund to your Credit Card.\\"<br /><br />I accepted this offer. I think it was more than fair seeing as how Amazon wasn't even the seller. $56.25 is closer to the cost of the UK version than $75.00. I can live with that lol.t for not noticing/understanding the difference when I purchased this anthology a year ago.

B004I744AS|5.0|this is a great app...works wonderfllul has everything I need<br />it is one of the best dictionary apps ive downloaded
B0010X745K|4.0|not bad of a movie  it could have took place in more than just the store  and the ending  kinda sucked
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Now I know what everyone was talking about. I like that these characters take on a life of it's own. Once I got past the first few chapters I downloaded books two and three. I can't wait to find out how the rest of the story goes. Best bathtub book ever.
B009329Y30|5.0|Great Chick Flick ... Your typical love story with a happy ending. Good one for date night at home. Loved it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is something I couldn't put down. I had to download book three ahead just so I could go on to the next book. These books don't dissapoint me.  Wasn't sure if Christian would open up as much as he did.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think it's a great game, even better than the carnival version.  You don't get many coins at first but the more you play, the more coins and prizes you get.  The only complaint I have is that if you buy coins, you don't get any free coins until the ones you've bought falls below the maximum number allowed (40 to start).  That is not very good marketing on the part of the game developer.  Why on earth should I pay for coins when that prevents me from receiving free coins?
B009SQRL4U|3.0|Good animation. Interesting characters. Predictable story. Not something I will probably see more than once. The kids enjoyed it but barely remembered it when it was out on DVD.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Mitch Albon always gives me something to think about  in his writings.  I recognized in this how much I am controlled by the concept of time and am being more conscious of how I use it.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|Just like the previous ones this one has good quailty animation, internesting characters, enjoyable story. This is my Daughter's favorite out of the 4 so far. Mine is the Great Fairy Rescue.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I appreciated Cheryl Strayed's honesty and self examination.  This is a courageous journey within and without.  For the life of me I can not understand how she made herself walk on those poor injured feet.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|This is clearly just another Disney Princess addition. Not sure I would put \\"Pixar\\" on the cover of this one. The animated short \\"La Luna\\" is clearly something I would consider Pixar quality but not this movie.<br /><br />The animation was well done but the story just was not that engaging.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a very good new series with a lot of action. My husband really likes it & we're 60ish. I would say...Try it - You'll like it!
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|My daughter and I really enjoy this series. The Great Fairy Rescue is my favorite out of all of them so far. Very clean and good family fun. Disney clearly did their research for the story on this. Also, excellent animation quality. Very much movie quality for a direct to DVD show.
B00447G29S|5.0|Great story, one of my favorite Christmas movies.<br />Watched on  47&#34; LG 3D TV.  Great effects, brilliant<br />colors and awesome sound!  If you're into<br />3D it's a must have!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Visually intense and graphically rich. Very little character development and somewhat predictable story... but enjoyable for a guys action / adventure movie.
B006LSZECO|1.0|3 friends recommended this book, but I gave up 11% of the way through and skipped to see how it ended. Really glad that I didn't waste my time on it. Bitter and unhappy people trapped together in marriage. No thanks. There are so many good reads out there but this isn't one of them.
B00932A6G4|3.0|I enjoyed the first Starship Troopers movies but hated all the sequels. This 3D animated sequel is actually the best of the sequels and had its good points. No real character development but fun action.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I loved this movie, definitely watch the Firefly series before you watch this, some of the more impactful parts won't mean as much if you don't.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I would have turned it off if I hadn't paid for it.  As it was there was a great sense of relief when it was over.
B004WR125O|5.0|Not much to it. I plugged it in, set up my network information and it works. Allows me to wiresless connect my reciever, for updates, streaming, whatever. Works great.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is probably the weakest of the three but I still loved it and the ending was perfect to end the series
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love this series and think it's criminal what FOX did with it. I would love to see it come back, best damn show period.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|If I wouldn't have bought all 4 I would have never read any after the first one. It has a good story line but the books are hard to read, the names of the characters change and in the first 2 books I had a hard time following the story line, by the third book I gave up and just kept reading and it would work out. Now I have read all four and am wrapped up in the story but I don't think i can read book 5. Instead I think i will just watch the tv series, because it does an excellent job of following the books.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|What a great little flick an amazing message! Cute funny and makes ya think!! The characters are well developed! Makes a great family night!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book and the series, a lot of people don't like the ending but I did, I felt it was perfect.
B005C7SXMS|5.0|This is honestly one of the best movies I've seen- I love it! I was a little worried about where or not it would play, because I bought it used, but it works perfectly; the only hing that was weird about it is that there is an important-looking sticker around the hole...so I haven't removed it (it hasn't affected the playability, though). The package also arrived quite promptly, which was just an added bonus.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My whole family enjoys this album. Talented people here! Loving their new twists to classics. I recommend this album to everybody.<br /><br />Thank you so so much!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano guys have really outdone themselves with this collection of some of the finest music available! The multiple genres that they cover is incredible. Can't wait for their next CD!
B006LSZECO|4.0|It kind of ended with reader wanting more future.  Not sure I would have ended the story in that way.
B001GZ6QEC|2.0|It seems like everyone liked the movie, but I found it very long, slow and full of sloppy sentimentalism. The good vs evil angle that the movie tries to take gets very tiresome - it gets preachy without being profound, with cheesy lines. The plot makes no sense. \\"Moneyball\\" was way more engaging, thoughtful and entertaining than this one.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Great series.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I thought it was going to be okay&hellip; 5 star! On kindle fire it works perfectly fine. Easy to set up and love the weather icon. It doesn't freeze or not ring in the morning. It wakes me up all the time.
B009RXCJ7I|5.0|In a culture where anyone with mediocre talent can become a superstar with a gimmick and a great publicist, it is refreshing to come across performers making a rise based on true talent and exceptional entertainment. After only hearing them once I am a huge fan. I recommend this for everyone. Now they have a Christmas DVD out. I've only seen excerpts, but I am anxiously awaiting my copy. Check them out on YouTube. You will be hooked. There is something for everyone. Cello Wars will amuse Star Wars fans. Look for holiday, rock, classical, and pop
B007PFD90G|1.0|This is one of the worst memoirs I've ever read. It is simply a detailed account of everything he did or that happened to him, practically day by day, before, during and (presumably) after the fatwa. I expected an examination of the fatwa itself and its impact on him, emotionally, intellectually, symbolically. Instead it is a name-dropping banal diary. I hated it so much, I deleted it from my Kindle halfway through, even though I paid for it and could have kept it in my library.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|My biggest complaint is Fire updates come way behind other devices. If the updates were current like other devices,  this app would be perfect!
B0059XTUVI|1.0|I was drawn to the movie by Streep, but was quickly disappointed by the dementia theme and hallucinations throughout the film.  Maggie's greatest offense is she was a 'conservative' and Hollywood never forgives.  I watched a 2012 DVD documentary (from the local Library) on Thatcher after enduring this painful hit peace, just to confirm what I remember of Thatcher.  Thatcher, Reagan, and Pope John Paul 2, were a formidable team.  This hit piece never really explored that relationship and only showed Reagan in one scene.<br /><br />I suspect when it is time, Hilary Clinton will be portrayed as a great world leader and nobody will dwell on Whitewater, Vince Foster, or Monica.  I'm sure she will be viewed favorably on the Libya fiasco and who cares if an Ambassador is killed. That is just the way it is.  Hollywood has an agenda.<br /><br />In my view, Thatcher ranks up there with Churchill.  She was truly a historical figure and deserved an unbiased portrayal.  Instead she is treated as a mental case subject to weird visions, somewhat similar to the technique used in the 'Last Temptation of Christ' with Dustin Hoffman as the Devil.  Of course, Jesus was not shown in a good light in that movie.<br /><br />Don't waste your time on this!
1401232590|5.0|this is not going to be very long. Batman: The Long Halloween blew me away I started reading and got to chapter 4 took a break and then read the rest in one sitting. For a book to hold my attention like that is rare. The Long Halloween is a must read.

071267067X|1.0|This so-called \\"Original Rider Waite Tarot\\" not only has a very bad image quality, it is also neither a re-edition of the original of 1909 (Pam-A) nor its photographic reproduction (Pam-D), but of an inferior re-drawing (Pam-B/C) from the 20's.<br />Apart from many other details (like the ridiculously squinting Emperor IV), this is clearly visible e.g. in the face of the angel in VI The Lovers; in the original design of Pamela Colman Smith, the angel looks affectionately downward onto the lovers, here he/she looks rigidly and empty straightforward.  Or in XIX The Sun where in the original among other things the word \\"LOVE\\" appears under to the signature of PCS which is missing in this version.<br />Also, here the fine shading of the colors in the original is degenerated to ugly blotches.<br />Unfortunately so far no really good reproduction of the original Rider-Waite-Smith Tarot is available; the deck included in Stuart Kaplan's \\"Pamela Colman Smith Commemorative Set\\" (ISBN-13: 978-1572816398) [[ASIN:1572816392 Pamela Colman Smith Commemorative Set]] comes closest, even though it still leaves a lot to be desired.  But since the original printing plates of 1909 were destroyed during the war, the original designs of PCS as far as known are lost, and only very few original deck are in the hands of collectors, we will most likely not have anything better than the \\"Commemorative Set\\" in the foreseeable future.
B0081L37Z0|1.0|Talk about lame.  Yes, I made the mistake of watching this lousy flick.  Live and learn... won't be doing this again.
B0067Q04AM|5.0|This is R&B music reinvented for the 21st century! I love everything about the album, the range of stellar artists, how many of the songs are reinterpreted, as well as the original works. Having received a grammy nom, this is one of my best albums of 2012!

B0076DELIG|5.0|I can recommend this book to anyone who likes this genre.  Michael Connelly has created a believable character with Harry Bosch. A real, honest-to-goodness cop who's not afraid to break the rules if that solves a case.  The back story in this book is particularlyinteresting.<br />I can't wait to read his next one!
1449410243|5.0|I had secret santa event.  I saw that my giftee liked cats so I bought them this book.  I looked through it and I want it for myself and I'm a dog lover not a cat lover! It's from the same people (The Oatmeal) who did 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth (And Other Useful Guides).  Really Funny!
B00979CS50|3.0|First off, this is a good album, as extensively described by many reviewers here. It's classic Neil Young & Crazy Horse stuff, with nice long guitar jams. However, the guitar playing  never gets really exciting, like in for instance Like a Hurricane, Cortez or Slip Away (I wish the last four minutes of that song would have been stretched out to 27 minutes, it would have reached Heaven!). Furthermore, the last part of Walk like a Giant, with the portrayal of giant footsteps, is way over the top, the effect fades after two minutes. Also two versions of the title song is redundant, the first one (with the distorted sound) should have been replaced by the alternate version. With this in mind, I would still have given it four stars. However, I gave it only three stars, because of another serious flaw, and that is the production of the album, more specifically the soundmix of the two guitars. In each one of Neil's long guitar solos, particularly in Driftin' back, Neil's guitar is far too much in the background, in many parts it is hardly audible over Poncho Sampedro's guitar. I cannot understand why the producers messed up the sound mix, especially since Neil puts so much emphasis on the importance of good sound quality. The album should be remixed, and with Driftin' back some seven minutes shorter, the first version of the title song out and the last five minutes of Walk like a Giant cut off, it would easily fit on one disc. In that case I would give it five stars and even buy it a second time.

B009ESIGHI|2.0|The child in me looks forward to the laughs, lessons, and heartwarming conclusion of this favorite every year. But... I'm still waiting for the \\"complete\\" quality the makers and the viewers deserve.<br /><br />The first time I saw the cut (\\"theatrical\\") widescreen version of this first rate production with that wonderful song \\"When Love is Gone\\" missing was on my DVR through Dish Network. I remember saying to my wife something like, \\"What the heck!!\\" Was that an edited cable TV version or something?\\" I had my VHS version tucked away under the TV because I was eagerly anticipating seeing this, my favorite version of The Christmas Carol in widescreen on a 46\\" TV. I was expecting that same emotional satisfaction I had experienced during past Christmas viewings. I had always appreciated how the writers had transparently used the same tune as \\"When Love is Gone\\" in the finale with different lyrics to paint a stark contrast between Scrooges lowest moment and the triumphant celebration of the his redemption. That missing association in the DVR widescreen version left me lacking and wanting the familiar, joyful, heart lifting feelings I had always experienced in the past. I was deeply disappointed. My inclination was to watch the VHS version ASAP to purge the loss I felt. I wasn't utterly disappointed because, in my own ignorance, I didn't believe there were actually over the counter versions without \\"When Love is Gone.\\" After all, who would do something that foolish?<br /><br />The other day I saw the Blu-ray in a department store and became exited at the prospect of ordering 3 Blu-ray disks for myself and my two long distance adult sons' families. They didn't have copies. What a Great Idea! It's a family favorite, right? A tradition to pass down through the grand kiddies as well. I had my suspicions about \\"why\\" that song had been missing in the widescreen version I saw, so I decided to read some reviews to see what others had encountered. Now I'm utterly disappointed. Does anyone in big business make the right decisions anymore?! Another settle for. I guess I'll sit on my old copy and let the boys decide whether it's a disappointment or not. I almost hate to give Disney my money for this but I know the kids and grand-kids will enjoy it anyway (and maybe the boys won't notice).<br /><br />Disney... children squirming through a song is nothing new when you consider the scores of music in so many of your old fashioned feature films. BTW... Since when was the Muppet Show and the many spin-off productions it generated EVER considered to be Children's programing anyway?! Funny, I don't remember my kids watching it on Saturday mornings. Do the words FAMILY and PRIME TIME still mean something to you?! You broke the Cardinal rule of Family Movies, reducing the appeal to those who spend the money. C'mon Man!! If you guys didn't spend time pedaling so much daytime crap between quality releases, maybe you'd still have some market sensitivity. How can people near the top get paid so much and still be so wrong?<br /><br />Thanks to those of you who informed the rest of us... and thanks for taking it to the producers.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|This book is an incredible achievement. A bold, clever, staggering work. Working through numerous times and genres, from the colonial to the post-apocalyptic, it explores ideas of humanity, fate, politics, philosophy, art and much more.<br /><br />Mitchell's changing voice in each part is flawless. His writing is on another level.<br /><br />To be fair, the sci-fi/post apoc sections are not great compared to some truly great SF out there, and the noir detective thriller section seems to drag on with a few too many double-crosses, but in the greater scheme of things, they do contribute to a bold and inventive novel.<br /><br />The story of Timothy Cavendish was brilliant - the first half is the scariest horror story I've read in ages. The ridiculous conclusion is hilarious.<br /><br />The Frobisher letters are just amazing. The voice and the character are superbly drawn. The Cavendish and Frobisher parts are definitely my favourite stories.<br /><br />A great book.

B009HELT3C|4.0|The third Men In Black film rates third as far as freshness and innovation go.  The first was undoubtedly the best and the second was a solid excuse to go back for seconds, even if some of the calories were empty.  Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones are adequate although they don't bring the same level of energy to this third installment that they bought to the first film, with a slight drop-off in the second film.  But, what makes up for familiarity and the lack of any revelation in number three is Josh Brolin's hilarious portrayal of a young Tommy Lee Jones aka Agent K.  He really nails it.  The special effects are up to the standards of the prior MiB films, although there's nothing new under the sun where the aliens are concerned.  Good excuse for some popcorn and light diversion.

B06XSQLK88|3.0|I have read the book 20 times over 4 years, love the book and it does its best to bring it to the silver screen but some of it is fanciful.... As it should, however some of the story especially sharing energy happens. Like when you and your bf/gf/spouse make each other smile you are sharing the love energy between both people. This is a OK movie adaption... Never went past the first of 3 books.

At least developed a plot and did a little developement on charcters. Didn't overdo the macho man thiong (come on, these people are who they are and what macho you still see is in your mind). Give them a little credit for still trying and enjoy the action and humor

B000002J5K|4.0|I found the movie to be ok, but not something I need to keep revisiting.  The music fares better without the movie in my opinion.  Some tracks like the opening 'She caught the Katie' are really great.  'Minnie the Moocher' makes me want to laugh every time I hear it, and the 'Rawhide' theme takes me back to the '50s TV series.  All in all a pretty good buy.

B000UO7IM4|5.0|This is a 5 CD set of re-issued albums.  As such each CD is in a separate sleeve like a miniature album cover with the original cover photo on the front and the original text on the back – you will need a magnifying glass or very good close vision to read anything!  Some of the albums were shorter than a CD can hold and consequently some bonus tracks have been added.  If you are already a fan, you probably have most or all of this music already, but if you want an introduction to Thelonious Monk (or if your original LPs are now worn out) you could hardly get any better value.

B004ZN9W5M|4.0|This is not something for an easy listen.  But it is good music and well recorded.  I would not suggest this as an introduction to Pink Floyd, but if you already know something of their music and want to get in a bit deeper, then this is an essential recording to have.

0978545095|5.0|As far as I am aware there are only two books on Maier to have been published so far and I have them both.  They are both good and there is no overlap as each book used different pictures, but if you are only getting one, then I suggest this is the one to get.  It has a better arrangement of the pictures and together with the text gives a much better idea of her life and the progress of her vision.
