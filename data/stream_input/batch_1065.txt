B0044XV3R8|3.0|i have no clue whose idea it was to put the two movies on two different disc that sucks half way thru the movie you have to put in disc 2 to finish which ever version you are watching. why they could not put the original and the re release on there own cd seen stupid it ruins the action of the movie, if i had known thats what these dvds where  i would not have bought them      so fair warning you play dvd 1 for which ever version you want half way thru you have stop it and put in dvd 2 and finish which ever version you are watching     i will be looking just for the rerelease version on its own dvd if they release it that way some where
0316098337|5.0|I LOVED this book! It was nice to read a story like this one from the point of the child, since we as a culture tend to fixate on the adult P.O.V.   It was captivating. It was a page-turner and I have currently recommended it to all of my friends!
B003A9SYTW|5.0|this is what i've been waiting for! looking for! music sucks so much these days that i'd given up and conceded that i would just remain hanging with my old school punk/no wave/blues sounds and nursing on the occasional teat of the rare/random gems found after much searching, as such i was resigned to my fate, and the fact that music, as i love it, was dead, to everything there is a season...but NO! on a whim did i check out the incredulous 'dead winter' from there i was brilliantly lead to 'the kills' and then the wonderous 'black rebel motorcycle club'...damn...it's like i've been sufficating and suddenly've gotten a huge relieving wiff of sweet mother oxygen...i will be buying EVERYthing by these guys, and the others as well....and now to get some 'black angels' for dessert. thank you oh sweet limitless music, you're not dead after all!

0763630497|5.0|This book is simply charming.Perfect for yourself,or as a gift.The haiku's are sharp,and clever.However,my favorite thing about this book is the lovely illustrations! Beautiful! I love haiku,and am a huge bird fan,so I bought this for myself,and I am so enjoying it.Perfect for the poetry fan,or even just a birding enthusiast,as again, the illustrations are charming.So glad I \\" found\\" this item!
0439023513|4.0|I also loved loved LOVED the first two books. I couldn't get enough. I rushed out the day that this was released and bought it. It is a must read because of the other two books. I have to say that I was a little disappointed at this book.( I couldn't handle how it ended. I finally had to sit down with a notebook and a pencil and re-write the ending so that I could relax. I couldn't believe how worked up I got about it.)     If you've read the other two books, you have to read this one too, just be prepared for the unthinkable... (but don't worry, it's still clean enough for pre-teenagers to read, too) Good luck.
B0036EH3WK|5.0|Is a product that comes very complete, I had all the necessary characteristics and I am very pleased with my purchase
B002HRTMHQ|2.0|This guy is a weak singer.  The songs are weak copies of classic soul. The arrangements are even weaker.    Only a marginal amount of songwriting craft keeps this from being a 1-star project.
1453624910|5.0|What a wonderful book for any Nightrunner fan! Lynn Flewelling always does a fantastic job! It was a little more erotic then most of her books, but the stories helped to fill in gaps in her character's lives! A must read! If you havn't read her Nightrunner series then I would check it out! I would read that first and them follow up with Glimpses!
0525951652|1.0|It is sad to see how the young author of On Wings of Eagles[[ASIN:0451213092 On Wings of Eagles]] sunk, in his old age, into the cesspool of Fall of Giants. Perhaps the pictures of the author in the back of book tell it all. On the back of On Wings of Eagles we see an earnest young man. On the back of Fall of Giants - well, perhaps an aging lecher.    Ken Follett has two magnificent qualities. One, he has talent. Two, he does serious and thorough research. The first of these qualities did not change over the years, the second one is not up to his earlier work. So, why do I feel good when I read Eagles, and frankly, feel dirty after reading Giants? Ken Follet now is unfortunately infamous fo his uncalled-for sex scenes. Of course, he claims that in a story there must be love, and then what is the natural consequence of that love? Unfortunately, he does it a little too much, and much too tastelessly. Probably he just thinks he will sell better if he sells porno.    The research is also weaker, and weak research means inaccurate and outright wrong.  Rather than go into all of his mistakes, here is the visually most obvious: in the map of Europe in 1914, on the inside cover, there is a wholly fictitious country named \\"Transylvania\\". Let me inform the great researcher that there was no such country in 1914 - it was part of Austria-Hungary, and more exactly, part of Hungary. (And it was part of Hungary from the tenth to the 16th century, then again from the end of the 17th until 1919, when the Versailles peace treaty - which gave us Hitler, the Balkan wars, the artificial and now defunct states of Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia among other great benefits - attached it to Romania).    Well, enough said - I would definitely not recommend this book
0312600844|5.0|Freedom is one of my favorite novels of all time. Don't believe the naysayers and read it for yourself. Having read all of Jonathan's prior work, I was a bit skeptical with the negative press. However, Freedom is more defined than The Corrections - not an easy statement - but true in this readers opinion. It is a novel of our times but also of years past and of future generations who will inherit our current \\"ownership\\" of our planet. Perhaps because I'm now in my mid-40's, I can easily relate to the well defined characters and their daily struggles - college perceptions of what their future would entail and the reality of the present. Thank you Jonathan Franzen!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Whether you have the DVD and are wondering if the Blu-ray is worth the upgrade or haven't seen this movie at all...GET IT!  The story makes a lot more sense with the added scenes and it's just a beautiful disc all together.  Not much else to say, but anyone with an HD tv should order this film the first chance you get!
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|I looked forward to this movie since I watched Sex 1.  It was a big FLOP because of all the foul language.  It just wasn't very good at all. Same old junk.
0446195529|5.0|We've ordered books from Amazon for quite a while and have never had a problem until now. The book, HELL'S CORNER, was ordered and the tracking information showed that it was delivered.  It wasn't delivered to our house so we contacted Amazon. That was three days ago and today, another copy of HELL'S CORNER arrived--overnight service with no charge to us for anything. We were very impressed and will continue to buy from Amazon.
B001QXCYZY|1.0|This microphone is beautiful (if you know condenser mics).  It has heft and looks to be the real deal - think Neuman U-87.  Now the bad news.  It is said to work with Windows XP, but I tried it on five very different XP machines into USB 2 ports (no hubs) and it does not.  I downloaded a driver and tried all the tricks Behringer and others suggest - NG.  Google this thing and read of all the other disappointed owners.  The conventional (non-USB) version of this might be great, but don't bother with this one if you are running XP.  Thank You Amazon for easy return.
0143038419|4.0|Enjoyable book about a woman finding herself again while experiencing life in different countries. I especially enjoyed reading about india and bali.
B003WTE886|5.0|this is a continuation of one of the best country artist's out there and I love it a have all her cds, so i would recomend this to anyone
B0040JHWKS|5.0|This CD package of unreleased songs from the Darkness sessions was well worth the wait.  Simply put, this is a marvelous collection of songs that magically reflect the incomparable songwriting and performing talents of Bruce Springsteen.   Rather than repeat what many of the reviewers have mentioned in detail, the listener will undoubtedly marvel at the considerable breadth of songs and sounds.  My suggestion is that you take a long drive, pop in the CD's and be prepared to be \\"wowed\\" throughout the trip. Releases like this and Tracks clearly wet the appetite for more collections of unreleased songs from the seemnigly bottomless Springsteen archives.
B000C65Z1G|1.0|Focusing on the evils of the British government and the pharmaceutical industry?  This would be a silly cliché in any setting.  But to trying to sell it with the backdrop of modern day Africa, with it's rampant disease, poverty, corruption, dictatorial tyranny and genocidal violence it too much to stomach. Worthless and counter productive!
B000002KDX|5.0|Debut albums can be tentative and later overshadowed by better subsequent releases.  This self titled America debut can't be viewed that way, it's a fantastic acoustic rock recording which seemed to have come from nowhere.  In reality Dewey Bunnell, Gerry Beckley and Dan Peek, all US nationals living in the UK, had been in different bands in the later 1960s/early 1970s.  Clearly influenced by Crosby Stills And Nash and CSN And Young, I honestly prefer America's music, well that is this one and the follow up, Homecoming.  Where to start, well the acoustic guitars sound like they are being played in my own back room and the vocals compilment each other very well.  Songs are often heartfelt without falling into sentimentality.  I already knew Sandman, A Horse With No Name And I Need You, however the remaining 9 songs maintain the same high standard.  This is an album that should be played through from start to finnish, sadly not all there later albums were as outstanding, too much overproduction from a certain (Sir) George Martin !
B0041X90ZS|5.0|I saw the Whirlwind tour show in Chicago earlier this year, and it has become, and remains, one of my favorite shows of all time.  This DVD (and CD) set captures what I experienced, and actually brought tears to my eyes with the same emotion and intensity as having been there.  First of all, the Whirlwind saga is the progressive rock epic to end all progressive rock epics!  79 minutes, 1 song! Live, it is an amazing spectacle, keeping you riveted the whole time.  The musicians are absolute virtuosos on their instruments, and some of the magic they peform onstage, is beyond words.  I still cannot get over how Mike Portnoy almost makes it look easy to do what he does on the drums!  I believe he is the absolute best drummer performing today.  Roine Stolt produces the most tasteful, dynamic guitar work, weaving wonders throughout the musical event, both beautiful and awesome.  Pete Trewavas is a powerful bass player, adding color and additional counter-melodies as only the best bassists can do.  But the star of the show is no doubt, Neal Morse on keyboards and (most) lead vocals. His incredible keyboard work is the driving sound of Transatlantic, and with his creative song-writing, (as I believe this was his concept, although I know the other members contributed greatly), this band has a magic about it that is equaled by no other band today.  Having praised their abilities, the DVD is almost all you could expect from a DVD; containing the complete show, behind-the-scenes documentary, background, etc.  It not only provides 3-1/2 hours of concert but allows you to get to know the men who put this together, and what makes them who they are.  One can only hope they will continue to make music together.  I highly recommend this set to any fan of great music.
B003ZK58WM|2.0|I was really disappointed with Fall of Giants.  Mostly it was that the characters and the story development around those characters was limited.  Although this is a long book, I didn't think that any of the story lines was well developed.  It seemed like what I recall Readers Digest doing with books.  Too bad.      Having said that, I will likely read the next installment as I enjoy historical fiction.    I have read many books by this author, and particularly enjoyed Pillars of the Earth, and to a lesser extent the follow-up.  This book was a disappointment by comparison.
0312600844|2.0|A disappointment with empty critics' reviews.<br /><br />\\"Freedom\\" started off interesting, talking about typical life of american suburbia. At painfully slow-paced, each characters unfolding in excruciatingly unnecessary details. Without a prominent theme/message; the book left me hollow empty by the time I come to the end.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I found myself unable to stop reading. This is a book that needs to be a sit down all night and into the morning. Read it with a friend because you will definately want to rave. I only wish the ending were wrapped up a bit sooner.
B003WTE886|5.0|This CD was a bit different than her others but I still enjoy it fully. It has been on repeat in my car ever since it arrived. I would recommend it to any T.Swift fan!
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Wow, I'm glad I was able to listen to the CD on his website otherwise I would have been upset that I wasted $15. The CD is not your typical Kid Rock music and frankly, I didn't care for it.  But, if you're a country fan, you'll enjoy it.
B0025KVLTC|1.0|Not a critique of the album, but one of the packaging.. I have received 2 of these so far from Amazon and they both had the same problem in that the CD gets stuck to the glue used to hold the cardboard packaging together. When you try to pull the CD out, the glue gets stuck on it making both of the copies I got unplayable. I wish they would have just used a regular case, or at least sealed the cardboard one up better.
B00418NXBK|5.0|I have come to really like the Kings Of Leon, since I got their last LP and they have not disappointed this time around! Check it out if you haven't already!!
0446691437|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read as a guide to why Art is a struggle and what to do about it!
0316098337|5.0|I very much liked this book, and I'm still thinking about moments of the story tonight.  I've only read a few of the negative Amazon readers' reviews, but my impression is that those reviewers are judging the book as a thriller.  In my mind, Room isn't posing as a thriller, although it does have some thrilling moments.  I understand that even some published reviews use the label, but it may be misleading some hardcore fans of the genre.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|The film is magnificent: harrowing and hypnotic at once. Lawrence and Hawkes are utterly captivating to watch. The dimensions of the drama are mythic, Shakespearean. Granik's work deserves all the praise the industry can heap upon a peer. I wish only that Daniel Woodrell--the author of the book on which the movie is built--would garner similar praise and recognition. What Granik does with visual images, Woodrell does with language. From the opening paragraph, all the way through the slim volume, the reader is held, trance-like, in a state of ineluctable horror and pity and awe over the narrative feats Woodrell accomplishes with astonishing ease. Masterful doesn't come close to describing his gift; you don't even notice his presence as he conjures up an entire world and dips you into the center of this young girl's soul. She becomes a classic hero, a warrior, a profound maternal presence. And you love her. Buy the book, read it, give it as a gift. This is what American writing can be. WOW!!!
B00006LI4S|5.0|It's not Pompeii; it's not Pulse; but nevertheless a concert worth hearing. It's a low-key, mostly unplugged rendition of the classics, and some other obscure tunes - excellent for a relaxed, lazy Sunday afternoon.  If you need the high energy, electric force of Floyd... watch Pulse.  It's an opportunity to see Gilmour without the mask of fancy electronics, so you can see the truly talented musician his is...     Plus you get Richard Wright, Dick Parry, Michael Kamen, a double bass, and a cello...   what more could you ask for???
0312600844|3.0|Reading this brought a lot of Woody Allen to mind, except that as comedies of manner go the story is heavily preoccupied with the emotional dross of our post-Nixonian American condition, and because of that the story never quite takes flight. I was reminded also of Ingmar Bergman's Scenes from a Marriage, because Franzen allows his characters free reign to work through the many pages of relationship dialectic that gives a novel of sentiment its engrossing inscrutability. Scenes from a Marriage, and other later Bergman movies, remain concise for all their laborious, winding verbal argument, because each point-counterpoint provides a glimpse into the novelty of the warring characters. The romantic or fraternal arguments of Freedom tend more toward a housekeeping routine, dusting off familiar heirlooms for several pages. It is somehow still engrossing, and I'm inclined to believe that it meets the requirements of a successful novel. The Berglunds and the people in their orbits endure decades of perfectly normal disappointment, and narrative arcs that require a considerable investment of a reader's emotional attention seek perhaps to formalistically reinforce these disappointments endemic to contemporary freedom by resolving flatly, or in the worst case of Joey Berglund, dissipatorily. It is not dark but it is a sincerely dim work of fiction, wrought by a genuine Eeyore.
B0043JEA14|4.0|great to see the band still making music but i  love the seventies era. michael mcdonald was a great addition to this group. still the best voice of any frontman in music.
B001224XYY|4.0|I fell in love with the song \\"You are loved\\" by watching the video on Youtube.  I bought the Album and tried to find the video but I haven't any luck and now they blocked it on Youtube. I play this ablum often in my collection.
0521677432|3.0|I'm very happy for my new English Vocabulary in Use Ipper Intermediate, but I was disappointed for the CDrom. It was not IT updating, unfortunately I received it for Windows XP or 2000. Really I expect it at least for Window Vista or Window 7!! I bought also the Business Vocabulary, in this case the CDrom included had got the new release. Why this not?
B0044XV3QY|4.0|This deserves high marks, unlike a lot of the crybabies here (it's gonna be released 10 more times, milk my wallet dry, etc.)I really liked the packaging, the pullout trays that hold the discs can be a little awkward to pull out-but nothing you can't handle. The book like format of the holder and the chipboard slipcase are absolutely 1st class. I'm glad I didn't buy the 1st release of Avatar, this movie really blew me away-btw-I never saw it at a theater. So all you crybabies out there-YOU DON'T HAVE TO BUY IT-no one's twisting your arm.
B00405DUYO|1.0|I never got to see the movie because, I guess it Region A isn't the United States.  Being completely ignorant of what regions are what it would be nice to have some kind of chart or listing so people could make the right choice.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Saying WOW does not mean that this is a \\"good\\" book.  In fact, only about 80% of the book qualifies as a WOW.  The part that does really does and the other part ranks as more of an \\"eeehhhhh\\".  This book completely pulls you into the premise and is propelled along by the narrator, a 5 year old boy living in the room with his mother.  This book is the epitome of the nature versus nurture debate and to see the story from his eyes is to realize that normal is simply habit.  The book challenges you in that you will understand the mother's perspective but root for the little boy in many ways.  It has indeed been a long time since I have been so engaged in a book.
B003WTE886|5.0|Taylor delivers again with instantly catchy songs like Speak Now and Mean, and subtly ensnares you in her emotional ballads. Bravo! I want to be her.
B003DZX3US|5.0|Comes with dvd, blu ray dvd, and special editions blu ray dvd. Beautiful story, great characters, and amazing music. This movie is something for everyone and will be watched and enjoyed forever.
B000NA2BEU|4.0|While this season is somewhat uneven and not quite on par with the first season of Veronica Mars it is still significantly better than many of its contemporaries.  Though I suspect you already know that if you are looking into purchasing the 3rd season.
0312600844|1.0|After laboring through over 300 pages I gave up and donated the book to the library.  Those long sentences, and characters I could not have any feeling for were too much.  I can't believe this book got such rave reviews.
B0031SU2Y2|5.0|A small film, \\"Welcome\\" provokes big questions in telling the story of Bilal, a seventeen-year-old Kurdish youth who, for all his exceptional drive, typifies the heartbreaking lot of Europe's illegal population. It's a movie of low-key but powerful gesture -- swimming instructor Simon's acts of decency earn him no accolades from those around him, only their incomprehension, even hostility. That's a face of heroism far removed from Hollywood cliche, and it's all the more persuasive and moving as a result. I don't wish to spoil for others the ending of this fine film by saying more, but certainly one walks away from \\"Welcome\\" overwhelmed by the tragic waste of human life and aspiration generated by Europe's inflexible immigration system. Of course much the same could be said about things here in the USA, but that's another story for another time.
B002QGSYRC|4.0|A little to gory in the war details but very informative about how McArthur and many other officers screwed things up.
0756665949|4.0|I bought this as a gift for my son for Christmas.  I glanced through the book and was impressed with the information given and the pictures.  He is going to love it when I give it to him on Christmas.
B002NXPTDK|5.0|I purchased this album right when it came out.  I could not stop listening to it.  I don't listen to much that comes out today but this is a must purchase!
B003NFM3JK|5.0|Movie snobs may laugh...but I think this movie is an absolute masterpiece of cinema.  Never has there been such foreboding in ANY of the previous versions...the Ghost Of Christmas Yet To Come is the most stunning visualization ever.  Such powerful use of...silence.    Hauntingly beautiful, the BlueRay version is something you will be playing generations from now.  I saw it in the theatre in 3D and was blown away, so I was a little wary that it may not have the same impact on the small screen...I was wrong.    I used to count the 1984 (made for T.V.) George C. Scott version as my favorite(with the 1951 Alistair Sim version a VERY close second)...I now have a new favorite!
B0032JTV6U|1.0|amazon has failed to send the item and i have now been waiting a month.  money is paid and still no parcel.     WILL NOT BUY OFF HERE AGAIN, WANTS MOENY REFUND!
B00007L4MJ|1.0|I ordered the 2010 \\"restored\\" version of Metropolis after viewing a film about it on cable; as per usual, Amazon's poor resellers sold and shipped me a 1984 version complete with added music---NOT what I ordered at all!!!
1897093519|5.0|This book embodies a lot I love in a book: moodiness, mystery, supernatural+scientific, plus a little romance.  It's exciting, fun, a great story, NOT corny... what more could you want?
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|I loved it. Hadn't seen it in a while, and was stimulated, made to think, and emotional too. Waaaaaay better than a typical Hollywood movie. Highly recommended by an ex-NASA engineer :-)
B0043URV8M|1.0|So I have listened to the soundtrack twice - once as a stand alone and the second time at the theater during the movie.  I thought soundtracks were supposed to enhance the experience, not the other way around.  As a stand alone piece, Alexandre Desplat's music is boring, uninspired, unmemorable, and borderline insulting.  As a companion piece to the movie (which I thought was otherwise outstanding), I found it to be sub-par at best.    Let's take \\"Obliviate\\", for example.  Without the film, it's ho-hum - and this is the opening piece!  With the film, it is Hermione's acting and David Yates' directing that allow the music to even register as a blip on the cinematic radar screen.    Next, there's \\"Sky Battle\\".  I said it before in my critique of \\"New Moon\\" and I say it again here - Desplat cannot score battle scenes.  His music is more frenetic and jolting than compelling or engaging.  He doesn't help put you in the battle, he just bangs away at drums and ups the tempo on his violins.  This is unforgivable considering that he was entrusted to carry on John Williams' classic work.  Compare \\"Sky Battle\\" to any of John Williams' fight scores - \\"The Duel\\", \\"Battle of Heroes\\", \\"The Battle of Hoth\\", \\"The Asteroid Field\\" - and you will see that he is completely and hopelessly out of his league.    How about \\"Harry and Ginny\\"?  When I first heard it, it sounded like a redux version of New Moon's \\"Marry Me, Bella\\" without any of the heart of that song.  Harry and Ginny are destined to get married, and this is Desplat's wedding gift to them?  A trite piece that I find difficult to write about because I can hardly remember it.    Finally, a word about Desplat's arrogant and self-centered scoring.  Whether or not you like the previous composer's works, they all had one thing in common - they respected the wonderful material that John Williams created for them and tried to incorporate it into their works.  Desplat hardly gives Williams' work any lip-service.  THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE!!!!  What Harry Potter film doesn't begin with the theme in all its glory?  Can you imagine Star Wars beginning without it's theme?  Even the new Star Trek movie paid it's respect to the old TV theme.  But no, not Alexandre Desplat.      Desplat recently said \\"I cannot write like John Williams. Only he can and I wouldn't even dare to try. He is the Master of film composers but, only by pursuing our own path, our own voice can we have a chance to challenge ourselves to do our best.\\"  This is a cop out.  You have proven over and over again that you are not in his league, Alex.  But this doesn't mean that you cannot honor his work.  There were several scenes you could have at least incorporated the memory of the most basic Harry Potter themes.  Instead, you felt compelled to put your own work ahead of the integrity of the saga.  This would have been fine if you had been up to the task.  But you were not, and it breaks my heart that you are coming back to do Part 2.  The ending of the Harry Potter saga is like one big battle from the time they get to Gringott's to the moment that Harry destroys Voldemort.  But you cannot do fight scores, you can't seem to do a good Ginny and Harry love theme, and you certainly don't seem to care to fall back on the wonderful pieces that John Williams created.      You've managed to distract from my enjoyment of \\"New Moon\\", and now you are detracting from my love of the Harry Potter series.  Shame on you, for your arrogance and lack of inspiration.
0553386816|4.0|I'm the kind of reader who reads a book puts it down and then has to read it again to remember what it was all about. With any of Grisham's stories it's not like this.  His stories are written in a way that one can see the sites and visiualize what it is like there  Ford County is a story of people who are miserable with their lives, live on a string and have a situation come about were three guys decide to do the good thing, donate blood for someone who they don't really know, but see an opportunity to get out of dodge.  It was an ok story, and as good as it gets with the story line.  Did not like the ending too much
6305428042|4.0|i bought this only because my two year old son kept coming home from daycare saying \\"poky pocus\\".  Finally figured out it was this movie because they watched it there.  He really likes it and it keeps him quite!
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|come on Kid Rock WTF?  This album is nothing like your other albums, which I have every one of... this is the first one I have regreted buying.  Thanks A Lot.
0553378384|5.0|I found that her assessment of the signs were extremely accurate for myself and everyone I know. However, I didnt care for the first pages where she writes that you are really a different sign. If you know what your sign is going into, then this is a great astrology book!
B000XVSU9O|3.0|The general premise of the book was very enlightening and enforces the concept that we should all get along and love one another. We are all energy. This I understand. But when it comes to exact descriptions of what angels and Jesus looked like as far as what they wore, the authenticity of her experience flies out the window for me.
B00004CXT5|2.0|Shipping took a little longer than expected.  Dvd wouldn't play on American DVD player.  Company was more than happy to refund quickly, so I would still recommend the company.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|I'd suggest this film be required viewing for high school/university students enrolled in any type of economics/ethics class. A devastating film- see it on dvd at all costs. (Why it played in cinemas for only a week is questionable and highly unfortunate).
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have listened to Josh's CD over and over again and each time I am more and more impressed.<br /><br />It is so extremely esoteric, and highly cultured that I am very proud that Josh is a part, albeit in a small way of our lives.  The high metaphor and deep spirituality in many of the lyrics and the soaring, almost beyond the universal definition of beauty is boundless on this incredible album.  Many  of the songs show the divine inside of this young man's soul.  He and his music are such a gift.<br /><br />I go along with the Washington Post when they said \\"What took him so long?\\"<br />Janet K. Brennan<br />author, poet and Internation Book Reviewer<br />Publisher, Casa de Snapdragon LLC
B00005214X|3.0|Sure, his big hit \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was probably the most recognized song that he's done outside of his Beatles work, but even his other Top Ten single from this album \\"What is Life\\" just isn't anything radio cares to keep alive.  I think \\"I Dig Love\\" and \\"Isn't it a Pity\\" would have been better singles to help George sell this album.<br /><br />I've played this CD many times over the years, and most of the songs never really stay with me in my head.  With the Beatles, he really got into playing the sitar.  And I really love its sound.  So, for the lack of his performing his Indian influence as he did with the Beatles, this album really is just only so-so in appeal.  It is no more impressive than any half-hearted eighties Moody Blues album.  Meaning, something that was essential about his sound and style, is definitely missing on this whole album.<br /><br />Paul McCartney has had more success in writing and performing catchy tunes.  If I play these songs from this album from George, I prefer to have them shuffle with the other Beatles solo works.
B00428ZRFY|1.0|I actually got the album 3 weeks before it came out; I actually had time to listen to the lyrics. Maybe this is just my opinion, but she spends too much of her time dissing Chris Brown. Okay Rihanna....we get it! You were battered and heart broken, but dissing Chris Brown is not going to bring him back! Honestly, I have lost sympathy for her! As a woman, I understand the physical and emotional rollercoaster one can experience after having a traumatizing relationship, but when is enough enough?! Women experience the pain of domestic relationships all the time and they need to be heard! If Rihanna is really that battered then (with the money she has) she should be funding homes for  battered women...other then that, she is just using Chris Brown as a crutch! Other than dissin Chris Brown (STILL) the only other thing that she sings about is how she fornicates. Her sexually suggestive lyrics have gotten worse since her last cd and its disappointing. I used to absolutely LOVE Rihanna; she was beautiful, talented, seductive yet classy, she upheld an \\"innocence\\" image, and she was humble. This new change in her has really just disgusted me! Of course the younger crowds are going to enjoy it and rave about how wonderful she is because lets face it....todays message is sex sells! I was born in '88 (not ashamed to admit it) where I grew up on profound lyrics. Now a days, the more you whore yourself out to Hollywood, the more the world loves you. The album \\"A Good Girl Gone Bad\\" appeared to be a \\"farewell to the old fans\\" album. There is no way I would let my child (if I had one) listen to her new garbage. Thats right Rihanna....show little girls (and boys) with impressionable minds that its okay to carry yourself like this. Oh but wait...shes grown right? So she can say whatever she wants right? If everyone had that same mentality, the world would have deteriorated a long time ago! We need to support and restore what REAL music is....trash like this is FADDISH! SUPPORT REAL MUSIC PEOPLE! STOP LETTING TRSH LIKE THIS BASTARDIZE WHAT GOOD MUSIC IS!!!!!
B003XSSR4W|5.0|Even though it had the two charted hits \\"Day After Day\\" and \\"Baby Blue\\", your not gonna get a better album from anyone that rightfully belongs on the Beatles Apple label.<br /><br />This is one of those albums where every track on the album could have easily been a Top Forty hit record.  They chose \\"Baby Blue\\" as their secondary hit from this album, but I would imagine that \\"Money\\", \\"Name of the Game\\", or \\"Suitcase\\" would have easily been Top Ten hits.<br /><br />I've loved this whole album for many years and I don't think anyone who loved the music of the early seventies would dismiss this album.  It's the one to have from Badfinger.
B003IPC5SO|5.0|O--M--G!!! That is all I can say! Speaking as an African American female, it has been a little difficult to admit that I took an interest in Kylie. Due to my ethnic background,  I felt a little pressure from my race that prevented me from admitting that I enjoyed her music. I am not trying to imply any disrespect towards my race, but I truly feel that if another African American steps \\"outside of the box\\" or is unique with no boundaries, they are looked down upon because they are misunderstood.  Well..I am here to say that I stopped caring about the pressure from some of my African American peers and I learned to establish my individualism because thats what human beings should all do. The first album that I purchased from Kylie was \\"Fever\\" due to the catchy lyrics of \\"Cant Get You Out Of My Head\\" and I have been HOOKED on her music every since! Since the purchase of my first Kylie cd, I not only started to take an interest in her earlier work, but I also started to anticipate her newer music as well. After continuously playing her album \\"X,\\" I anxiously anticipated \\"Aphrodite\\" when I heard the news about the future release. I must say....every since I got hooked on Kylie, she has yet to disappoint me! The upbeat tempo that she carries in all of her lyrics not only supports dancing, but also working out (believe me, Aphrodite is perfect if you are working out). Kylie has supported my personal restoration of music and she has yet to let me down! Aphrodite appears to make a statement from Kylie; a statement that says \\"I am back, I am bold, I know my fans have missed me and I am here to give them something to smile about!\\" My personal favorites on this album were:    \\"All the Lovers (even though I was not a fan of the video....)\\"  \\"Get Outta My Way\\"   \\"Put Your Hands Up (If You Feel Love)\\"  \\"Everything Is Beautiful\\"  \\"Aphrodite\\"  \\"Too Much\\"  \\"Cupid Boy (my absolute FAVORITE song on the album)\\"  \\"Looking For an Angel\\"  \\"Cant Beat the Feeling\\"    There is only one song that I really do not care for, but will listen to it, and that happens to be \\"Better Than Today.\\" Other than that, I absolutely LOVE this album! If you enjoyed \\"Body Language, Fever, or X,\\" then \\"Aphrodite\\" will not disappoint you! Many people try to disrespect Kylie by stating she emulates the style of Lady Gaga. WHERE IN THE WORLD DID THEY GET THAT IDEA?! Kylie (IN MY PERSONAL OPINION) holds two titles: \\"The queen of the dance genre\\" and \\"The queen of originality,\\" and I am confident she will hold those two titles strong until the day she no longer makes music! Wonderful job Kylie! I look forward to your new album....whenever that may be :D
B001AIRUPE|4.0|This is one of my all-time favorites. I know the movie word-for-word. I don't own this particular movie set but I have the other DVD set (which also comes with 3 discs). I plan on buying this one for Decoration purposes as well as getting my original VHS of the movie back from my mother (she kept it after she bought me the DVD). I am a devoted collector of ALL Tim Burton items. I absolutely love him and his creativity.
B003U0AHBO|3.0|Ridley Scott's 'Robin Hood' provides the viewing audience with an informative if not consistently entertaining perspective on the Sherwood Forest bandit that will all know and love. I found the story line solid, the production values high and the soundtrack engaging. As far as the casting, well anytime you have Cate Blanchett on the screen I'm happy and I've been a big fan of Max Von Sydow for years so that was a welcome addition. As for Russell Crowe, well I must admit I was disappointed in his performance. He seemed listless and uninvolved in his character. I got the impression that he didn't really want to play the part and was just going through the motions. Being the central focus of the story that definitely hurt the film immensely.<br /><br />'Robin Hood' never came to life for me as it should have. I love the Robin Hood mythos, all the production necessities were present and the cast was solid. Yet there was something missing. It lacked that emotional hook that draws the viewer into the story and forms that bond between viewer and onscreen character. As I was watching the film I was somewhat enjoying myself but I was also aware of the passing of time and periodically wondering when it would end so I could go on to something else. That's never a good sign.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|great product for hard wood or tile floors, goes anywhere, \\"sweeps\\" anywhere thanks to spinning brushes on all 4 sides and a swivel head that lets you maneuver it at will; no more dragging out the big ol' upright only to blow the stuff around, or the swiffer to miss anything larger than a dust bunny.  Only \\"down side\\" -- if you need the written guide for assembly, you better speak (or at least read) Chinese!

B000X107GI|5.0|Great price for these batteries.  Used in a bathroom scale and working fine for the past month.  Would definitely buy again from this seller.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|I first saw this as a double billed feature with \\"Billy Jack\\" in 1970. I was blown away by both films. And because \\"Monte\\" was missing from DVD catalogues all these years, I thought I was the only one to recognize the beauty of this \\"forgotten\\" film. Now, after seeing the rave reviews here, I was way wrong. Ha! My favorite scene has to be with Chet and Monte dozing on the porch, and Chet gives Monte the devastating news that not only is he getting married, but that he is thru being a cowboy...man..listening to that music score makes this scene a real killer.     And then there is the opening scene with Mama Cass singing the theme song...and while your at it..you can throw in the scene in \\"Charleyville\\" where Monte \\"rides down the grey\\".  A Bronc-bustn' scene that was a cause of much wonder and controversy at the time.  Just how in hell did they film that? And you can also throw in....ah hell...throw in the whole damn movie. It's all spectacular! If you want to experience the old west as it was, while at the same time taking a wild emotional ride..get the DVD...One cannot over state it, the acting, music, and cinematography are stunning. This has got to be one of the top five best westerns of all time! A masterpiece from start to finish.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Fight or Die, says the front cover slogan on the Region 2 version of this disc.  And that is pretty much what you'll see for the duration of the movie.  However, it's pretty effectively done and never dull.  The visceral and perhaps overly bloody hand to hand combat is linked together with a genuine narrative that hangs together well, despite a few minor logic flaws along the way.  Michael Fassbender is convincing in the leading role, as the Centurion who becomes attached to the 9th Legion.  The 9th are led by the fearless General played by Dominic West.  However, the legion is attacked by the Picts as they march into Northern Scotland, and the General captured.  Only 6 men led by the Centurion survive, and they decide they must first attempt a rescue of the General before they return home... however they are being hunted down by a Pict tracker with uncanny abilities (Olga Kurylenko).  Kurylenko is interesting in the role...  Even covered up in bulky skins, face painted over and wearing an almost permanent snarl on her face, she still looks a little too gorgeous for the role.  However, her physicality won me over, as she almost convinces that a young woman could go mano a mano (so to speak) with highly trained veteran legionaries.  One thing the movie really has going for it is the look.  Period movies can so often show the shortcomings of a limited budget - but here the production values are excellent.  We believe we are looking at the 9th, and the Roman armour and trappings look the biz.  The scenery is sumptuous.  Afterall, this is Scotland - albeit some of the bleaker parts, with either snow or drizzle in many scenes.. not necessarily the tourist board approved stuff.  So it's no masterpiece, but fairly and squarely tackles Hollywood at its own game, and comes away without egg on its face.   The more you think about it, the more questions you might have, and if you're a historian - well, this is as close to the reality of what happened to the 9th as Gladiator was to how Emperor Commodus died.  But having said that - it's good fun, it didn't flag, held my interest, and felt like it had its own voice.
B0042KZJR8|5.0|Love the EP cd. End of May is amazing and MB did it justice.  David Fosters Best of Me is a beautiful song and again MB did it well, different take than the way Barry Manilow did it so it is not boring.  I am not a big fan of the song Hollywood but it is a fun song.  The live versions of the other songs are nice.
B003Y8YXEO|5.0|Having some of these songs brought back good memories of the power  and influence that the Beatles had and still have on us.  I play IMAGINE often and use it during yoga class as a way to  bring out the Inspiration and Hope in people.  Everyone relates to the words, no matter what their cultural  upbringing or age is.
B003JTHESA|5.0|For me, the record from Brave New World up to The Final Frontier have been four of Iron Maiden's most unique and captivating albums of their career. For a band who has been around as long as they have to put out material this strong is nothing short of brilliant. I enjoy this album very very much and look forward to their future even more!    I love the old records too, but I'm not going to be stuck in the past when their present and future are this amazing.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|My only explanation for the harsh reviews is that Josh has given up on his previous \\"commercial formula\\" that guaranteed the success of his previous albums. He adopted a somewhat different path that might not be readily appealing to the \\"occasional\\" Josh fan or the mainstream listener. The melodies are definitely not as melodic as previous songs by Josh, and there are no upbeat tracks except for \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\". However, I find this album highly artistic, and a \\"must have\\" for any one who likes this genre of music. The only reason I gave it a 4/5 is that most tracks are written in a \\"major scale\\" (a technical thing for musicians to understand), and this doesn't exactly match my own personal taste. I have no other reason whatsoever to underrate this album, and I believe that it will take listeners some more time to understand and relate to this album.  Sam,  Egypt.
034544678X|5.0|Even for the experienced dog trainer, this book is full of excellent, practical insights into canid-human relationships.  As the title implies, it's more about our attitudes and instincts when we relate to dogs than it is about dogs themselves.  Just the simple recognition of how our instinctual desires for ventral-to-ventral contact are interpreted on a basic level by our pets is an insight that can help us approach training and everyday interaction with a lot more patience and understanding.  I can't recommend this book enough.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I am a Norah Jones fan. When I've had a tough day, I'll come home, chill out and turn up Norah. What I love about ...Featuring is the collaboration Ms. Jones has with a wide range of other artists. The music genres range from hip-hop to country and brings the listener on a tour of toe-tapping, head-nodding, finger-snapping fun. Love this mix of duets and collaborations.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Love the movie. I love Jonny Depp. I am glad that it was a very creative movie that even I tried making grilled cheese with a iron. It was fun but not something to truely try. But fun to try I really would say it is worth the money to buy you will not be disappointed.
B002RWKSII|4.0|i bought this on ebay for under $8 (including shipping. what a bargain!) i love the beach boys and brian's work with them is phenomenal. this is george gershwin's work reinterpreted in a beach boys-brian wilson style, which suits me just fine. i am not, and do not claim to be a gershwin connisseur, and brian's voice hasn't sounded this good in a long time. granted, he doesn't have the versatility he had back when the bb's cut surfer girl, summer days and summer nights, or even smile, but the guy is old already, so cut him a little slack. the wilson-i-zations of the gershwin tunes bring back echoes of past glories: smile, pet sounds, and sunflower. my only complaint is the case/packaging. it's one of those digipack cases where it's difficult to pry cd from the case. i probably will just put the case away and put cd in a slim plastic case for easy handling. enjoy!:-)
0060775858|3.0|I first have to say that I am 30 years old at the time of writing and I had never read this story as a child. I bought it recently for my three-year-old nephew because of its reputation as a classic children's story, and I read it for the first time when it was delivered. Before receiving it, I read some of the negative reviews and wrote them off as \\"just not getting it,\\" despite the fact that I hadn't actually read it yet. I just figured a classic story such as this couldn't possibly be bad.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I have to agree with some of the negative comments I've read. This book's reputation seems to be based more on good memories of having read it as a child than of it actually being a good read in itself. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but there are certain things I look for in stories that I buy for my nephew, and this book did not have them.<br /><br />Ironically, what I think is the biggest problem is probably what many people find so appealing about it: the simple phrases of \\"Goodnight X, goodnight Y\\" are simplistic to the point of stupidity, and that's the entire book. Each page has one or two of these phrases, which means you will be turning the pages rather quickly. Granted, you can dwell on each page and study the items in the room, and let your child find the mouse hidden on most (but not all) pages (which my nephew enjoys doing), but there are two problems with doing this: 1) I read to my nephew with just a bedside lamp on, so it's difficult to lie there and study the page up close because the room is fairly dark (and don't we want it dark when they're trying to go to sleep?), and 2) this severely breaks up the rhythm of the story -- not that there is much of story anyway, but saying \\"Goodnight socks\\" and then spending two minutes looking at items on the page, then turning the page and saying \\"Goodnight mouse\\" is not my idea of a compelling story for a child to learn from.<br /><br />I also don't understand why every other pair of pages is in black and white. If the writing isn't so stellar, then the artwork should be, and it is fine on the colored pages, but the black and white pages are rather boring.<br /><br />What I'd like from a children's book is a story interesting enough to capture my nephew's imagination and keep him interested in the characters or events. I'd also like more sustained writing so that he can hear the flow of sentences and enhance his vocabulary. \\"Goodnight Moon\\" offers neither of these things.the writing isn't so stellar, then the artwork should be, and it is fine on the colored pages, but the black and white pages are rather boring.

B003QTSM4S|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  Though it is dark and at times I had a knot in my stomach,I would suggest the viewing of this film. This movie will make you stop and think....
B003UYUR10|5.0|A delightful movie to watch. It's too bad more people didn't watch this movie in theaters here in the States (Domestic Sales: $90,759,676 vs  International: $244,394,892). Prior to seeing this movie I was not a fan of Jake Gyllenhaal but he did a superb job in his role! I could not think of another actor that could have played his role any better. All star cast and a very entertaining movie for the family! A must have for your Blu Ray collection.

0307454541|4.0|The writing that navigates you though this complex tale is workable, the wording isn't sharp or well-tuned, and there are few memorable sentences. But there is enough sheer joy in the story, and at least four plot lines to keep you turning those 590 pages.<br /><br />Besides, the rawness of the writing is part of the charm of this book, and lends authenticity to the story, which is thoroughly engrossing and never loses its pacing or direction.<br /><br />The main characters - Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salender -- are excellent and they interact wonderfully in the multiple and engaging storylines, which offer loads of suspense. When you get to the end, you'll want more. Fortunately, this story continues in two more books.<br /><br />At least one reviewer grumbled that the detective story at the end of the book is an unnecessary distraction. I disagree. After more than four hundred pages of intrigue, investigation, family drama, and suspense, Stieg Larsson's story still has enough stamina to engage the reader in yet another interesting story. This one is about the marvels of modern-day computer hacking and techno-snooping, and this storyline was set-up at the beginning of the book and acts as a bookend to the main story. It needed to be resolved and I saw it as a necessary progression that added even more richness to Lisbeth Salander's personality.<br /><br />The entire story shows how much painstaking work Larsson put into a single volume and readers will immediately want to begin another book in the series to see what happens next.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0307454541 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]
B003EYVXT6|5.0|Any film that takes the imagination a step beyond is a hit with me! This one did. Just enough reality to keep you interested; you know, not 'so far fetched' that you can't engage with the plot.<br />It had the right intense factor; and a few twists as well, spiced with a hefty bit of terror - the right recipe for a great Saturday Night special with popcorn at the ready!
B0043URV8M|4.0|The thing I hated about Patrick Doyle's score for \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" was that it was all noise. Even the quiet moments were loud and attention-seeking. Desplat fortunately knows how to separate the two. Unfortunately, he basically ignores the themes that came before (even though he said in an interview that he would incoporate them more than his predecessors).     This score isn't as epic as \\"Goblet,\\" but that's okay. I was still impressed by what I heard. There are even tracks that sound like they were composed by John Williams himself. \\"Fireplaces Escape\\" comes to mind. And I love the creepiness of \\"The Exodus.\\" Overall, a very decent score.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I am not going to write more about the movie itself... may be there are only like 30 people left in the entire universe who has not seen this awesome, entertaining gem from JC. I have watched this movie in IMAX 3D twice and I thought watching in TV (I have Panasonic 58\\" Plasma) would be nowhere near the same experience... and it's somewhat true. But, the additional 16 minutes and the jaw-dropping audio and video quality of this movie makes this buy worth every penny. The packaging is done well and the additional contents are absolutely worth watching more than once.     For guys...If your wife/girl friend is questioning your new LCD or Plasma purchase, go get yourself a nice Blu-ray player, get this movie and watch it with her. She'll thank you for getting the TV. :)
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I received this CD from One2One to listen to and review before it hit the shelves. Which made me happy because I was going to buy it anyway. This collection of songs \\"Featuring Norah Jones\\" is great. There are so many different genres on this one CD from country to rap to everything in between, all featuring the beautiful voice of Norah Jones. I especially enjoy the \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" duet with Willie Nelson. \\"Ruler Of My Heart\\" with Dirty Dozen Brass Band really shows off the unique tone of Norah's voice.
B003VANOFY|4.0|PROS:  Nice bass response. Great full sound in surround sound mode. Head set sits snugly on my head. Seals my ears to BLOCK out most room sounds.  Great wireless range. Easy setup.  Battery holds up to a nice long gaming session, and if it dies you can always use it plugged in with the usb/charge cable.    Cons:  Frequently interferes with my wireless internet connection.. no help available on this topic on manufacturers website--still looking to solve this issue.   Surround sound mode has a ton of \\"reverb\\"; there should be more options in the software to adjust effects and surround sound quality.    Uncertain:  The headset certainly should hold up to normal use.. not sure how durable it would be to any rough wear and tear.  Unsure of how true the surround sound mode feels.. I only use it for gaming.. I would need to test it with a great surround sound movie to truly give an opinion.    Overall:  Once the wireless internet issue is sorted out, this will be a great headset that offers just what I was looking for.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I don't call myself a huge Groban fan - but I really loved his Christmas album.  So when I saw this CD was being released, with a winterish cover and a song about \\"bells\\", I figured I would give it a try.  First of all, it's not a holiday album (I didn't deduct stars for that, just wanted to clarify).  It's less opera-pop, and more nasally jarring.  Some of the tracks start out and his voice just isn't up to the standards found on the Christmas album.  It took me a couple of sittings just to get through the entire CD.  There may be some people who are die-hard fans who will like this, and that's great for them.  But for those who got into Groban due to his Christmas album, you may want to save your money.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|Not sure what happened or who advised Josh Groban on the song picks for this CD.  But, it is the WORST ever.  I should have sampled it first before buying.     Wish I could return it.      Really expected Better from Josh
B002ZG98FU|2.0|There aren't a whole lot of movies set in the behind the camera TV-world, so I really look forward to them when they are released. I have a degree in broadcasting, and love stories of those in the field.  Morning Glory, the latest \\"news-movie\\" to be released, debates the question of how much \\"bran\\" (hard news stories) vs. \\"donuts\\" (fluff pieces) should be shown during a national morning news show.<br /><br />The film has an all-star cast led by Rachel McAdams (The Time Traveler's Wife, Red Eye) who plays 28 year-old Becky. Down on her luck and recently fired, she takes the only job she can get working for the low-rated Day Break news show. It's a program that wants to be like The Today Show, but cannot keep up to that pace of professionalism. Through a couple clever (or stupid) turns, she convinces a legendary reporter, Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), to join the other resident host Colleen Peck (Diane Keaton) after the firing of another host (Modern Family's Ty Burrell). The two veteran hosts don't get along - fighting over everything thrown at them including who says \\"goodbye\\" as the show closes. For poor Becky it's a nightmare - and the show doesn't improve. It will be cancelled unless something magical can happen in the six weeks they have left. You see where this is going.<br /><br />Ironically enough, this okay-but-disappointing film suffers from the very problem it's well-aware of - there is nowhere near enough \\"bran\\". This is a happy little movie that is too afraid to throw any real conflict into the mix. Every problem is solved with a smile, every fight is stopped with a hug - it's just too much. There are people who will probably love it for it's tidy little story-lines and unrealistic resolutions, but I am not one of them. While there were some genuine laughs, there was just too much stupidity for me to ultimately suggest seeing this movie.
B001M5UDGS|2.0|Except even my High School sophomore son didn't like it.  The surreal isn't surreal enough, every plot turn is predictable, and the songs are not very interesting.  Could have been so much funnier.  We're huge fans of Firefly and Serenity, so perhaps our expectations were too high.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|Unstoppable is kind of like a sports movie. If you've seen the ads, you know it's about a runaway train and two men who chase after it. You know the movie can only end one of two ways - either the men stop the train and all is well, or the train derails and devastates. So for just over an hour and a half, this movie needs to keep our attention despite the ending being completely predictable. The cast is led by Denzel Washington and Chris Pine, with Rosario Dawson also turning in a nice supporting performance. These cast members are really playing second fiddle to the train though, as that's what we all really want to see.<br /><br />The movie is loosely based on a true story, but you quickly can tell how loosely by all of the \\"close calls\\" the train has with hitting stuff. There is a group of students on a train headed towards the runaway train. There are a couple of nervous horses on the tracks. These instances were a little cheap and unrealistic. It's not to say that there wouldn't be close calls in this type of situation, but the overacting of those involved in these situations was silly. Also, some of the instances aren't resolved on screen, just in a passing comment like \\"Oh, that van was moved by the way.\\" My other problem has to do with the ending. I won't spoil it, but let's just say if you really think about it, it's kind of unrealistic.<br /><br />On the plus side, despite being predictable and silly at times, the movie isn't slow. They quickly tell the story and then end the movie - there isn't a single wasted minute. I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire time. It's very entertaining, and it is quite fun. So while this won't win any intelligence awards, it isn't a waste of a movie outing or DVD rental.
B0043URV8M|3.0|When Half-Blood Prince was released almost two years ago, a lot of people were severely underwhelmed by Nicholas Hooper's musical contribution. Understandably, since it amounted to nothing much, except a much needed change of musical voice.  But David Yates, who insisted in pushing the Harry Potter films into a more dramatic niche, for whatever artistic reason, stayed true to his desire of plastering Harry Potter with music that, with his direction, had little chance to soar.  So, here we are with Alexandre Desplat.    You could rightfully say that, atmospherically, Alexandre Desplat took exactly the same route with Deathly Hallows as Nicholas Hooper took with his two scores. The significant difference is that Desplat actually has the musical chops to create a listenable and, almost thoroughly, enjoyable score.    You have to look at Deathly Hallows from various perspectives. First of all, there are the musical qualities of the score on its own.  Alexandre Desplat is a very fine composer, and it shows. As it is appropriate for a movie of these proportions, he chose a heavy leitmotivic approach.      The motifs, though presented in various guises, never reach beyond the comfortable zone of sounding \\"rather nice\\", and don't even aspire to create just one awe-inspiring moment. That may also be because of their shorter and more simplistic nature, which prevents them from being developed beyond their basic setting.  For specific settings, Desplat wrote setpiece-like cues, with little unique motifs, like the \\"Detonators\\" cue for instance.  I wonder why, despite Desplat's talent, modern tendencies a la Remote Control made their way into Harry Potter. The music for the Death Eaters, beside a basic four note motif, is invaded by the nowadays omnipresent low string ostinati.   And \\"The Elder Wand\\" offers a few bars that sound very much like Pirates Of The Caribbean.  It may work in the film, it is still a lazy move.  Where Desplat really scores is in the personal, emotional sequences, like \\"Ron Leaves\\" or \\"Godric's Hollow Graveyard\\". Here, the music wanders through touching, if sometimes predictable, harmonies - even though one wonders how often you can use thick string chords until they lose their effectiveness.    The booklet lists various choruses, including a children's choir, and they are used liberally throughout the score, in interesting ways that sets the score apart from other chorally enhanced works.    Desplat, being more of a low key composer, did the action sequences appropriately, even though they are not very inspired. \\"Sky Battle\\" opens with a promising build-up and fanfare, before it segues into an interesting variation on Hedwig's Theme, and into rather disjointed bursts of orchestral mayhem.  For the finale, \\"Rescuing Hermione\\" and \\"Captured and Tortured\\" are dissapointing, they provide nothing but fragmentary blocks of mickey-mousing.     Conrad Pope, John Williams' regular orchestrator, worked with Desplat on Deathly Hallows, so there is the occasional Williamesque ornamentation, a flute accent here, some trumpet rhythms there, which makes for a pleasant surprise.  Speaking of John Williams, Harry Potter is a 7/8 movie franchise, and evaluating Desplat's score just on its own simply does not do justice to the entire concept.  Just like Patrick Doyle did before, and even more so Nicholas Hooper, Alexandre Desplat completely threw continuity overboard.    I know the ever-resounding argument that the themes from the first films could not be implemented into a film like Deathly Hallows, since it \\"matured\\" beyond that. This is simply rubbish. These guys are professionally trained composers. Only because you can't imagine it doesn't mean they cannot do it.  Yes, I know, John Williams didn't use alot of his themes for \\"Prisoner Of Azkaban\\" - but he developed brilliant replacement, and he knew how to expand the sound, and he did, because he knew how continuity works.  Doyle, Hooper and Desplat apparently don't, or they aresimply too self-involved.    The argument is not so much that these folks ignored the first two films, the equally great issue is that they ignored Prisoner Of Azkaban, especially the Family theme.  To completey throw Williams' work away, and to then score the opening titles of Deathly Hallows with a generic Remote Control string rhythm, that is rather bold, to put it nicely.    Does it fit the film? Of course it does! But that's not what I go to the movies for, especially in this kind of film!  While the music is nice, it doesn't leave any kind of imprint on the film. Furthermore, the toning down of the music to inexplicably low levels, and the omission of cues like \\"Ron Leaves\\", \\"Lovegood\\" or half of \\"Goodbye To Dobby\\" further reduce the score's effectiveness dramatically.    None of us film score listeners would be here now if Williams, Goldsmith, and probably Horner as well, had not reached out for something more than \\"doing their job\\" - apparently, that is all a composer needs to do nowadays to reach greatness in the ears of the beholder.  With that attitude, we had never gotten our Star Wars, our Indiana Jones, our Star Trek, or, yes, our Philosopher's Stone.    The rather tragic conclusion is that even though Desplat's Deathly Hallows is musically far and beyond anything Nicholas Hooper created, it remains just as anonymous, not only because it misses the mark of giving the film any kind of unique touch beyond the composer's usual handprint, but also because it completely ignores continuity.  John Williams will not return for Deathly Hallows part 2, so we have Desplat finishing the series. Given the thematic material he offers here, there is little room for development, and having a score like this one, who does not even bother to include an original end credits piece, finish the entire Harry Potter series ... well, is this a cause for celebration?    Play this CD to anyone, and he won't notice it's a Harry Potter score. Despite all the motifs Desplat wrote,people will still walk out of the cinema whistling Hedwig' Theme.
B003Q6D27S|2.0|In the seventh go around, the 3D gimmick is employed to make the crazy traps come alive. And being the seventh entry, it's only natural that this Saw is in need of a good sharpening.<br /><br />I've seen every film in this series, and this one falls somewhere in the middle as far as plot, quality, and creativity go. The movie is being advertised as the final Saw, and I hope that's true. I have always been intrigued by the overall premise - which isn't just to slice and dice innocent victims like so much of the \\"torture porn\\" does nowadays. These movies take moral and ethical dilemmas, and turn them into inventive life or death games. This seventh film lost a lot of the originality and the traps seemed quite repetitive, while many of the deaths were not justifiable in the realm of the Saw logic. Here the filmmakers just decided to splatter as much blood on their 3D audience for sheer shock value - and that is not something I am a fan of.<br /><br />I will say, without spoiling the ending, that the last five minutes were extremely satisfying. If you're a Saw fan, you should see this movie if for nothing more than seeing how the saga concludes. If you've never seen one of these films and are curious, rent the first one. I am still impressed with how these movies connect to each other - there were characters in this final chapter that were introduced seven years ago when the series began.  I just think this outing focused on the wrong characters for the majority of the time.
B002GJT4XW|5.0|In love with this. It was worth every penny to me especially if your an Ulimate Harry Potter Fan! The extras and documentary had me intrigued and fasinated all the way through, way more extras than I orginally thought it would too!     Only thing with the package I got is that the book thats included actaully came out to be a misprint and the cover and the pages of the book are reversed...so you have to read it backwards kinda thing, which sucks but im not heavly complaining since I'm probably one of the few that got this misprint edition. LOL
B000OPPBEQ|1.0|... Amazon EVER ships it to me. My order was placed October 9 and has had the delivery set back TWICE and is now \\"promised\\" between Nov. 26 and Dec 1. What the hell is up with that? The freakin' ad still shows copies available now! I am pissed and disappointed to say the least. \\"Apology\\" emails aren't cutting it AMAZON, I want my order, you have my MONEY. Ship the product. NO MORE LOUSY EXCUSES!
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I don't know if it is unhealthy to listen to each song a CD hundreds of times and still not be sick of it, but regardless this CD is fabulous. EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING about it is perfect. I was a small fan of florence+the machine, having heard a few of her songs before, but now I am a huge fan! Her music is strange, sometimes a little creepy or weird, in a really enjoyable way and I love that an artist has gone out of boundaries and made something that does not sound like every other album. Her voice is beautiful and soulful sounding as well, overall a very fresh sound. Also I am a dancer and have found a lot of her songs to be choreography worthy and can't wait to see what I can come up with. If you like one of her songs then I am sure you will like her whole CD, it is really that good! Happy listening!
B003XRZZFM|5.0|This album did take a few listens on my part because of all the complex arrangments infused here, but when it's all said and done it's once again Puratanium power and then some!    From the iry intro. of Xibir through the Star War's like Endings and Continuations, I can only state that this effort continues in a very similar tradition as previously offered up. Very Death Cult Armageddonesque/etc..! There are a few more epic rides to take and then add interesting female vocals like on Gateway and you get more clever twists from the Northern sons! STILL/ongoing riffs, sonic drumming, fantastic keyboards, fabulous choir soundscapes, and orchestral mayhem remain a notable constant as to be expected!     Too bad about the lineup changes/sucks to hear when band members supposely are not putting out maximum effort? Aside from this, Shagrath, Silenoz, Galder & co. continue on in true Dimmu intensity and don't seem to miss a beat minus Vortex & Mutis!     ABRAHADABRA ROCKS! Check it out and take another interesting ride into the dark winds of the NORTHERN DARKNESS!
B003EYVY0E|1.0|I got both 3 & 4 at the same time, paid $80 for where I bought it from.  As I watched them I thought \\"There's no extended footage!\\".  The ONLY reason I bought these was for the extended versions of the film like with the 1 & 2 Ultimate Editions.  I could care less about the crappy trading cards or whatever you call them and most of the extras on the discs aren't in HD anyway so I don't even watch them.  I'm really pissed off that I PAID $80 FOR THEM!!!!!  I'm not the richest person in the world and now I can't return them because I opened them. :(
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones' new album, ...Featuring, was a really unique album to listen to and, honestly, a lot of fun. The album is a star-studded collection of the Norah Jone's musical collaborations spanning the past decade. All of the 18 songs on ...Featuring are cameos, collaborations and duets featuring artists from every genre. The collaborators range from legends like Ray Charles and Dolly Parton to more current artists like OutKast and Foo Fighters.  The tracks on ...Featuring cover a multitude of musical genres, including jazz, country, hip-hop  and rock. Not having listened to a ton of Norah's music previously, I was honestly surprised that her songs were so diverse. It seemed to me that the tone of the song often matched the collaborator, making for a really unique mix of songs on one album. My favorite song was the rendition of \\"Baby It's Cold Outside,\\" featuring Willie Nelson and Norah Jones. I'm a huge sucker for Christmas music and with the holiday season close upon us, I guess it's really no surprise that that song stood out. Some of the other highlights were \\"Bull Rider\\" (Norah Jones and Sasha Dobson) and \\"Here We Go Again\\" (Ray Charles and Norah Jones).  I liked the diversity of the album and the variety of musical talent featured. I know it will be on my Ipod soon! Courtesy of SuperMommy Reviews [...]

B0027BOL4G|5.0|This movie changed the way I feed my family.  I do not eat meat but I feed it to my family.  My shopping cart has different choices since seeing this.  Every mother should see this and share it with their kids.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|everytime a movie comes out now, i always do reaserch on if there will be future realeses for special editions. thats what i did here, i saw there was a special edition comming and i waited. yes it sucks now that many movies or i should say companies like fox and sony etc put out many versions of the movies. its a basic business skill, casue they know people will fall into it. they know it make things easier to put all versions out or the special versions out right away but that wont make them the money, not since so many people are pirating the movies. so stop complaining, and yes the 3d version if you care for that fad will be out soon. it is true that perfecting techniques for disks to play right on tv takes a while. i dont say its right what they do but you cant help it now days.     now as for the movie, this 3 disk set has 3 versions of the film with all the bells and whistles. its worth it if you like the movie and its cool to see the differences. yes it sucks that theres a go to disk 2 to finish the movie but what do you expect, this movie has alot of detail and takes alot of room, and by keeping it to 3 disks instead of 4 makes it cheaper for us. you can see for other reviews the differences in the movies. dont let those one star reviews influence you if you like the movie. if you already bought the 1st version, then sell it to a used dvd store this version is much better, and if you want the 3d then wait a couple of months but really is it worth the extra money for 3d fad?
B003WTE886|5.0|Once again Taylor Swift has managed to get inside my head and sing about everything I can relate with!   I didn't think she would be able to top her \\"Fearless\\" album, but she is full of surprises!  I am beyond pleased with this album!  The transaction with this seller was fast and smooth. Over all a great experience!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Ok, I'll start off by saying that I' am far from a fan of the fantasy genre, yet I picked this book on a whim. All I have to say is \\"wow.\\" What a awesome read. I have never written a book review before (except in school) however, I felt compelled to add my voice to the praises of GRRM. \\"A Game of Thrones\\" is on one hand character driven yet action packed. I loved, loved, loved this book and am so looking forward to starting book 2. Sorry for the vagueness of this review, but trust me, read this book and I guarantee you will become transfixed by the world that GRRM has created.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I really liked the movie but I have a question about the similarity in disk chapters.  Is the only difference between disk one and disk two \\"A Message From Pandora?\\"  If you look at the disk contents, they are otherwise exactly the same for disks one and two except there is a variation in the order.  Does this mean that there is really a two disk set with an extra on one disk?
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Does it matter really if some of the tunes found here were \\"recently finished\\" or not?  Well yeah it kind of does.  It takes away from the historical significance of the collection, at least I think so.  Yet I don't find that to be a deal breaker.  Most of the music found here really is remarkable in the sense that none of it saw the light of day for three decades (the songs covered by other artists aside).<br /><br />Somewhere between the reviews here calling this \\"Darkness 2\\" and others expressing dismay at the \\"finishing\\" of various demo tracks lies the reality of this release.  There really are some fine tunes on this collection (newly \\"finished\\" or otherwise) but with very few exceptions I can see why none of them made it onto DoeEoT and to be honest, maybe it was for the best that there was no album in between Born To Run and Darkness....<br /><br />Still, this is a very very good collection of songs and as I said, it's amazing none of them have been officially released until now.  Thanks to The Boss for allowing this to be issued on its' own and not forcing everyone interested to shell out the huge money for the deluxe package.  The price for what's found here is certainly a bargain.  Listening to \\"just missed\\" Springsteen tunes from thirty years ago beats any of the crap that comprises \\"modern rock music\\" today anyway.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|The other negative reviews sum up my feelings.  I will only add that this was a unfocused story with no character or storyline to believe in.  I am surprised that Oprah selected this novel.  I am an avid reader and have followed her selections, but found this had no literary or moral value.  I don't recommend this at all.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|There seems to be a concerted effort by a number of fans to boost the ratings of this CD by posting glowing reviews, so it's going to be slightly more challenging to decipher what is a genuinely great review and one coming from a fan who would give 5* to a recording of Groban reading the telephone directory. I also presume, therefore, that any reviews that are not favourable will come with a 2/17 people found this review of use attached. All I can say is that if you are considering purchasing this CD, are not a self-confessed music starved Groban fan who is just happy to hear new music after several years, and if you have access to listen to it via a streaming service - take the opportunity to listen to it first before buying it. The mixed reviews really do indicate that this album is polarising listeners and fans, not least because the greater abundance of falsetto that has crept in. You may enjoy it, but I would try before you buy first.    My own personal thoughts --    I will freely admit that I was never a serious fan of the early work Groban did with David Foster and I don't view this as a Foster v Rubin thing, so this isn't a hankering for a return to the older style recordings. In fact, I was eagerly anticipating this album based on what Groban had said about changing direction. He had actively played that up in interviews and the choice of working with Rick Rubin seemed to indicate this, as did his live version of \\"Changing Colours\\" which I really do enjoy a great deal and listen to often. However, I don't feel that he's done that. And yet, at the same time, I think he's charged off in many different directions. I just do not know what to make of this album, even after forcing myself to listen to it for a dozen times or so when I'd rather have left it alone. I'm aware that some albums require work to grow on you, hence I wanted to give it a chance, but this isn't happening. Sadly it's the opposite effect and every time I listen, there is a reinforcement ofwhy I do not enjoy it and can't face listening to some of the tracks. The Nick Cave cover? Massive orchestral arrangement. An Italian song? Massive orchestral arrangement. London Hymn? I'm expecting to hear it booming out of Westminster Abbey any time soon and terrifying me with shock. Interspersed with songs that are, I presume, the stripped-down sound Groban was hoping to achieve. To me, it just doesn't flow or have any coherence as an album. I just feel that it's trying to be so many different things, and in doing so it unfortunately misses the mark.    I find the lyrics at times to be simplistic and a bad stereotype of what love is often written as; I honestly believe that Groban, judging from Awake's \\"February Song\\", can express a far greater depth of emotion than he does here. Some of the harsher remarks regarding the reactions of laughter at some lyrics that are expressed in some reviews are, I probably can guess, even holding back on saying what they really want to because they have a great respect for Groban and are concerned with being skewered like a kebab by fans. Having said that, I certainly do remain a fan and hope he continues to grow as an artist and experiments musically - even if it sometimes misses the mark.     I can't face giving this one star, because I don't want to relegate it to that level and I genuinely do applaud artists for attempting to push their own boundaries. But I wish I would have waited before ordering the CD - like another reviewer, I can't cancel the order winging its way over the Atlantic. Sadly it's staying in the packaging, to be gifted to someone that I'm probably not that close to.    Edited to add --    I have noticed some commenting regarding what I said about fans posting positive reviews because of a perceived backlash to the album. My comments came as a result of a thread on his official boards, [...], entitled \\"Be sure to leave a 4 or 5 star review on Amazon.com. The CD could use them.\\" I merely think that people who are not fans, and who are wanting to spend their money on listening to what could be a new artist to them, should hear a balance of opinions. JG fans have (rightly or wrongly) a reputation as being aggressively protective towards him, and whilst all the positive reviews are very clearly not aimed at merely boosting the rating of this album, many of them explaining very honestly and in detail what they like about the music - that thread was sent as a link to many fans, and as such it could have an impact on here. I think it's only fair to point that out and people can then decide for themselves.
0765326353|5.0|Many a reviewer have said that the book was too long, but I say that 1000 pages is wonderful.  Although the book did seem to lag in parts, during my second readthrough I found those parts necessary to either explain the magic system or to develop character.  Having now enjoyed both the book and audiobook (which is even better) I cannot in good conscience give this book any less than five stars.    I just cant wait for the next to come out.
B003E48AYC|5.0|I had purchased DVD at a discount and looked forward to watching it with high expectations. What made me buy this is having seen parts of this movie at Costco and Sam's Club as I would walk past the large screen TV's when shopping. We just finished watching it on our own large screen TV, blu ray version of course and I was blown away. My expectations were high but this film exceeded even those. Visually stunning is the best way to describe it. The story was entertaining and the acting fairly good but the visuals are a dazzling delight. This is what human imagination and high technology is capable of if they are both in full use. Too often the technology is and the imagination isn't. I recommend this to you.

B003YFIUW8|5.0|Ok, this book was so far out of my comfort zone it was a little bit ridiculous.  Still probaly one of the very best books i have read in my life.  I can only imagine what it is like to be Jack.  Worse, I can picture myself as his mom and being critiqued by idiots that have no clue.  I cryed like a baby.
B001UV4XI8|4.0|I like all six of the previous Harry Potter films, but I'm not a big fan of what director, David Yates, has done with the last two installments. Maybe it's just the source material, which I have yet to read, but while the stories have gotten darker (which I like), they have also become less interesting. I do understand that the innocence of the early films can't remain for the plot or characters to progress.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I think Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is very well done. Sure there are some overlong sequences, too many characters forgotten about due to the huge cast, and I do miss seeing Hogwarts, but judging by the first half of the final chapter, it's going to end on a high note. The main trio have all grown as actors in more ways than one. All of the supporting players we've seen over the years are a welcome sight, but like I said before, often given too little to say or do.<br /><br />The CGI is impressive, yet not overdone, the music still remains gripping, but most important of all, I actually care about the characters and what lies in store for them in Deathly Hallows: Part 2.<br /><br />Here's my ranking of the seven films thus far...<br /><br />1. The Prisoner of Azkaban<br />2. The Goblet of Fire<br />3. The Sorcerer's Stone<br />4. The Deathly Hallows: Part 1<br />5. The Chamber of Secrets<br />6. The Half-Blood Prince<br />7. The Order of the Phoenix
B0047O2HJC|1.0|This box set is just what it's supposed to be, and while I have most of these in stereo (& some 5.1 I've never heard because I don't have a surround system) from the fantastic SACD issues of a few years back (the 1st & 3rd albums did not get an SACD issue) if you want the mono mixes this is your only option. Plus, there was unfortunately some much discussed weirdness in the John Wesley Harding SACD and this mono version is a welcome substitute.  There are not the glaring stereo vs. mono mix differences as in The Beatles catalog- I'm familiar with the mono mixes from the great Sundazed LP reissues which I have. But the set is well presented, the mini lp sleeves are lovely & the sound so far (I haven't listened to whole set yet) is about as good as any reissue of 60s music I've heard on Redbook CD.  However, I'm very disappointed in Amazon- they packaged this very poorly and the slipcase/box arrived damaged.  There was not padding or bubble wrap inside the shipment box, so the box set unsurprisingly was damaged.  Also, they glued the bonus disc and info sheet to the box, leaving slight stains upon removal. But what really bothers me is the huge dent/crack on side of the outer slipcase that holds the discs. The discs and mini lp sleeves look undamaged.  I'd send  this back for another but I'm worried that the next set will come in even worse shape, with not just the box but the contents of the box also damaged- again, there was no care taken in packaging this.  This is my first bad experience with Amazon- I would like  them to just send me a replacement slipcase, if possible. I hate to send this back and get something even worse.<br /><br />Also, a note for anyone wondering- I've heard plenty of live Dylan, boots and eventual official releases. I do not like the practice of making these bonus discs available for limited time through limited vendors- I think it is a disservice to fans (it really bothered me that the bonus tracks in the iTunes collection were not available for individual purchase, and I don't think fans should have to buy a box or pre-order from Amazon or any particular retailer to get a limited edition CD- CDs cost nothing to press and  they should be widely available upon initial release). I welcome any and all archival Dylan releases.  I enjoy the included Brandeis 1963 show shipped in this \\"Amazon.com Exclusive Bonus Edition\\", but it is not among the more stirring performances I've heard from early Dylan on stage.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|In the past, I was never a fan of Norah Jones.  I was given this CD to review and took it to work with me, popped it in the computer, and listened.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I thoroughly enjoyed the CD.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I am typically not a jazz listener, however, when I received a copy of this new Norah Jones CD I instantly loved it.  Despite the fact that I am not much on her voice, I think that this CD ROCKS... I found the other different musically talented artist who id Duets with Norah on this album to compliment her very well.  The variety on the CD was huge.  I think it hit on rap, country, blue grass, rock n roll... You name it, it was there..  This is an awesome CD.  Check it out.
B003VB5E2E|5.0|I am watching this concert as I type this review.  I am also looking for tickets for the 2011 Crossroads Guitar festival.  The video is shot in full HD.  The audio quality is above par.  I would expect nothing less from a product which Mr. Clapton would put his name on.  I am extremely impressed!
B002VECM6S|3.0|Sandra Bullock looked different as a blonde and she was a kind of interesting character the way she takes charge and does things. But the story was unbelievable. Too lacking in realism. I like fairytale endings and I like feel-good, but things happen too predictably and easily here. I have the movie lying at home but haven't felt like watching it again.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is a great movie.  It is probably over looked by many but it's both interesting and inspiring.  The director takes Temple's view of the world and shares it with the audience.  A must see.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The preview photos show them as one smooth piece of plastic, but in actuality there's a square of rubber in the middle of the curve (where the \\"2\\" is) for added grip.
B003L20ICE|3.0|I love that this film is trying to normalize all the various families we have in the USA. After living overseas in two developing countries, this is the freedom I love about our country-so shame on those reviews that are just hating...go watch something else. I am so glad that they picked amazing actors, really did some thoughtful portrayals.     However, something that may seem small really bothered me and I felt like writing about it. Somehow, in the light of all the hating going on with LGTB, why is it ok to hate on the Latino gardener? He was treated horribly, and though Moore's character does mention it, it really wasn't ok with me. It felt like a class-issue, it felt horrible to think of my Latino family watching this portrayal, the vocal impersonations, all that-can we just stop that, please?     It also leads me to my final issue with why this movie wasn't a success to me. The kids-their voices were not heard, there wasn't much development and in the end, the title didn't work for me...It's ok, there were some important things...love that it wasn't violent and there were some sweet moments, but I was disappointed with it at the same time.
6305428042|5.0|The movie arried in the time stated.  The quality of the DVD was great.  And of course as always, the movie was amazing.
B003Y58CKS|5.0|These traditionalism-vs.-Regietheater times are too heavily partisan, and some of the choices made too idiosyncratic, for Nikolaus Lehnhoff's 2008 Dresden RIGOLETTO not to displease a significant minority. I urge patience. The DVD would be recommendable even if it were simply a brilliantly played and exceptionally well-sung RIGOLETTO (it surely is that) with a troublesome production. In fact, it is more. This time, the oddities (a *very* decadent, decidedly R-rated masquerade for the first scene; Act I Scene 2 mostly set in Gilda's bedroom; the unorthodox Act III quartet, with the Duke and Gilda sharing a symbolic clinch before the former returns to his \\"literal\\" spot with Maddalena) accumulate in the right ways, and settle better in the long view.    Although the experience is of a RIGOLETTO that is distinctive and slightly disorienting, the liberties taken are properly in details, not in focus or theme. Verdi's opera is still, from its sinister opening measures, a bullet aimed for a spot right between the eyes. There are several things a director can choose to emphasize at the expense of other things, and Lehnhoff's is an unsparingly brutal treatment: a story of goodness trampled as a freakish thing in an environment that cannot sustain it. It is both valid and overwhelming. In the final scene, the pathos of Diana Damrau's death acting and Maestro Fabio Luisi's deliberate pacing (Luisi is all thrilling extremes: marathon-fast in cabalettas, with the saved-up time generously ladled out elsewhere) seem to go beyond fulfilling the requirements of a melodramatic formula. It's about a tiny light in a dark place being snuffed out, and a terrible world being left more the terrible for it. By the end, I was genuinely shaken.    There is such an emphasis from beginning to end on masks and hidden faces that it sometimes seems as though Lehnhoff is checking RIGOLETTO and UN BALLO IN MASCHERA off his to-do list simultaneously. Over that brief, menacing prelude, we see Rigoletto getting dressed for his day at the office and smearing on the greasepaint like Canio (he pointedly removes it as he returns home). The courtiers appear in many guises from scene to scene. They begin in outrageous (and impressive) animal masks, the stuff of a wild carnival, and are even more horrible to Count Monterone than the opera absolutely requires. For the abduction of Gilda, they are costumed as black flies. By \\"Cortigiani,\\" they have made another transformation: leering, horned devils. Rigoletto futilely rages, begs, appeals to better natures that are not there. When he turns individual attention to Signore Marullo (Matthias Henneberg), the latter shows his true face, and though handsome, it is as cold and impassive as the mask that had hidden it. There seems not to be a soul or heart at all there, never mind the \\"gentle\\" ones of which Rigoletto pathetically speaks.     When Kyung-Hae Kang sang her first few gorgeous notes as the Countess of Ceprano, prepared as I was for the weak comparimario voice one usually gets in that part of a few lines, I knew this was going to be a real ensemble feast, not just a performance with a few stars surrounded by mediocrity. In the lead roles, Juan Diego Flórez (his wholesome looks successfully sleazed up with a quasi-mullet hair attachment suggesting club trash of about 20 years ago), Diana Damrau, and Zeljko Lucic have the equipment and the estate to make it all sound easy, and their performances take wing from that security -- they have a range of options at their disposal. A list of examples would be long. Flórez, as ever, can make the most hackneyed tenor items sound freshly considered. Lucic is not a fat-voiced Verdi baritone of days gone by (MacNeil, Taddei, Merrill), but there are color and shade to his instrument, as well as expressive warmth, and both this house and the microphones flatter him. Damrau's \\"Caro nome\\" is simply a breathtaking piece of singing -- the control and detail one always hopes to hear inthis and rarely does, and every note and breath furthering an *idea*, not \\"decoration\\" but elaborative fantasy. Georg Zeppenfeld's Sparafucile (black shades and switchblade recalling the villain in WAIT UNTIL DARK) upholds the standard of excellence, and Angela Liebold actually squeezes an intriguing character of Giovanna, the duplicitous minder. Only Christa Mayer's zaftig Maddalena seems out of place: awkward on stage, without chemistry with Flórez, and vocally no more than satisfactory, though not harmful to the quartet.      While the lead trio is a well-matched team and no one is overtly trying to \\"win\\" the evening, it is Damrau's Gilda that will linger longest in the memory -- not only for the disturbing image she presents following the Duke's forcing himself on her: hair disheveled, skin scratched, white dress tellingly bloodied in a very specific spot. In her first scene with her father, Damrau had seemed to be overacting embarrassingly, and knowing as I did that she is generally a fine stage actor and that Lehnhoff typically does not elicit poor acting, I waited to see where this was going. And I saw ultimately that this Gilda was to begin as a real \\"child\\" -- not radically younger than specified in the libretto, but perhaps a manic, sugar-high, jumping-on-the-bed and pillow-fighting kind of teenager. She can hardly keep still to go to sleep, so atwitter is she over her amorous thoughts of \\"Gualtier Maldé.\\" Her implied sexual awakening has her physically demonstrating excitement the way a young girl might on Christmas Eve or the last night before summer vacation begins. Knowing what we know is coming, it is heartbreaking. The behavior gets subtly calibrated by every subsequent exchange and every subsequent event; and by the time Gilda dies, Damrau is playing an adult who has achieved tragic stature. Brava.     If I have a single objection here, and it really is less something to affect one's buying decision than something for me to take up with Nikolaus Lehnhoff in a debate that will never occur, it is that I believe one important dimension of the opera is lost entirely: the monstrousness of Rigoletto. We *hear* about it, from him and from others, but we do not see it. No effort has been expended to make Mr. Lucic other than the handsome man he is. Rigoletto's much-discussed hunchback is there but barely noticeable. RIGOLETTO is about an innocent brought to her end by the \\"love\\" of two men who are both, in their fashion, monsters -- only the one is easier to spot. Rigoletto's obsessive paternal love has kept Gilda so sheltered and unworldly that she's defenseless when she becomes a young woman and attracts this more sinister brand of hovering male figure. The Duke *also* wants her all to himself (for a time) but his motives are darker. Gilda may have survived being in the orbit of one of these two; caught between both, of course she must be destroyed. None of this is in the RIGOLETTO of Lehnhoff. His jester is just a noble and devoted father with a job he hates  (of course, the selfishness of his destructive quest for vengeance -- despite the begging of the daughter he would avenge -- cannot be gotten around). I grant that RIGOLETTO is a work that can take a certain range of approaches, but Rigoletto is a protagonist...never a hero.     Those with the broadest definition of \\"Eurotrash\\" (I failed to mention the modern dress) may want to stick with the Dexter/Levine Met performance of 1977 (Cotrubas, Domingo, MacNeil). But for its remarkable solo singing, conducting, orchestral playing, and choral singing (an incredibly precise male ensemble throughout, and \\"wind\\" effects in Act III that sound as eerie as Bartók), allied to a powerful dramatic presentation, the Virgin performance is the new essential.

0312370849|1.0|I flipped through this book, unable to read the whole thing straight through and unwilling to waste time trying. I cannot imagine why this has received such hype or so many glowing reviews. The writing itself was lackluster and the characters tragically flat and annoying. I was appalled at the way every choice the main character (Julia) made was presented as not only a great idea but the only reasonable option. How is it reasonable to so myopically pursue a single idea, of only tangential importance, that you sacrifice intimate relationships and innocent people's happiness? Sarah's story could have had great potential, but it wasted here. Don't waste your time or money.

B003INBNXO|4.0|At one level, this is a fairly ordinary martial arts movie. Mangy-looking bad guys move in on a town of peace-loving martial art masters and their schools. The peace-lovingest master of all, Master Ip, whups him handily and sends him packing, after a neatly choreographed duel. (The best part, for my taste, came when his small son tricycled into the mayhem to pass the message that Mom wants the fight over before they break the rest of the furniture.)<br /><br />This takes place in the 1930s, though, just before the outbreak of WWII. It's easy for Americans to forget the Sino-Japanese front of that war, which brutalized large swaths of the Chinese countryside. Master Ip's village falls, invaders commandeer his property and, like everyone else, his family falls into poverty under the invader's boot-heel. Master Ip takes the honorable route, finding what labor he can to support his family - a drop in social status that he takes with good grace, since he shares it with everyone else.<br /><br />The general of the occupying forces starts a vicious series of fights, using Asian martial arts but with a gladiatorial feel to the 'entertainments'. These culminate in a faceoff between Ip and that general, with the result you'd expect - and with a disproportionate effect on the morale of the occupied Chinese.<br /><br />As a plot mechanism, the lone defender of civil and family values stands as well in this movie as in scores of others before and since. This has special resonance, though, because of the historical background created by WWII, a legacy that survives even today in resentment at the atrocities committed back then. Perhaps the plot never excels (though some of the fight scenes do), but the historical setting taps into some very deep feelings.<br /><br />- wiredweird
B0043URV8M|1.0|While I appreciate the very brief homages to John Williams' unforgettable work on the music of Harry Potter, they are not enough to save what is otherwise a completely forgettable score.  At least this time he was no so arrogant as to disregard his predecessor's work completely, as he did for \\"Twilight - New Moon\\".  But I wonder if this was by his own choice or not.  Perhaps Mr. Desplat feels that his work is so exemplary that he can jettison the work of those that came before him, but it is not.  Perhaps Mr. Desplat believes the hype of those enablers who write such glowing reviews for work that is so forgettable, but he should not.  His work on its own smacks of forgettable mediocrity.     Mr. Desplat, remember that when you step into the musical shoes of a saga or franchise that you did not launch, you should respect the fans enough to keep a semblance of continuity for their sake.  Rather than try to reinvent a perfectly good wheel for ego's sake, maybe you should think of the car as a whole.
0060930349|5.0|An exceptionally well trained professional historian provides factual support for what people in the Tea Party Movement are trying to accomplish and it's timely even though the book was published in 1999. The book traces the religious roots of America's founding, and the evolution of the peoples' inherent belief that smaller government is better and is almost always a wise political position to take.  Before I read this book I thought the best one-volume history of America was \\"A Patriot's History of the United States\\" (see my Amazon.com review of Schweikart's and Allen's book, dated October 6, 2008), but now I'm not sure. You have to read them both.  They mainly differ in what is emphasized.<br />P.S.  This book could have had more editing. For example, on page 436 \\"South California\\" was confused with South Carolina twice.

B0029NY9YO|4.0|This film, based on the graphic novels, seems to be draped in darkness with the exception of the blue glowing Dr. Manhattan. This use of darkness reminded me of the film Blade Runner but also reminded me of the paintings of the Renaissance where all characters are presented in darkness illuminated sometimes by strong light with the exception of Christ, often glowing as if illuminated from inside his body. Thus there are some loosely associated similarities to Christ entering a dark world which does not understand him and Dr. Manhattan's transformation and evolution and eventual distancing himself from the human condition and perspective as his vistas grow and he seems to take on the impersonal cognitions of a distant God.      The use of an alternative past as the setting for the film allowed for political commentary, particularly about political opportunism and short-sightedness, as evidenced in the character of Richard Nixon.     Yet in many ways it is also a film noir with all the dark puzzle pieces of a private detective film from the 1940's. There were some very strong performances including Jeffrey Dean Morgan as the Comedian, a superhero with strong sociopathic and violent tendencies. However Jackie Earle Haley steals the entire film with his outstanding performance as Rorschach. This bundle of pent up and everlasting rage is often more than the other heroes can endure. Haley's wild scenes in prison are worth the price of the film and his dialogue is darkly wicked. Billy Crudup plays Dr. Manhattan, a character that links Christ and physics in one character struggling to be both human and God. The character of Jesus has this same duality since Jesus is both God and human. Thus Dr. Manhattan struggles to remain attached to the human world and its emotional attachments while at the same time he is mastering the mysteries of the physical universe. Christ feels compassion for his fellow humans and it is this quality that Dr. Manhattan is losing or nearly loses inthe film. There is much speculation around why Dr. Manhattan is naked with blue genitals. But this links him to Adam, for he is a first and unique being.  Malin Akerman is spectacular as Silk Spectre II, the force that eventually convinces Dr. Manhattan that the human race is worthy of redemption. Patrick Wilson plays Nite Owl II as the more human, humble competitor for Silk Spectre II's affection. He plays this part very well, rising to heroics gradually as his testosterone levels rise.  Matthew Goode never convinces us that Ozymandias was ever a team player with the other heroes so his later antics don't seem much like betrayal. The storyline is pure entertainment and draws from a thousand references and plots. It is predictable and yet the film is fully entertaining.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Suppose you lived in a world that possessed the technology to invade others dreams? What if that power allowed you to dive into the deepest depths of the human mind? From Christopher Nolan's mind comes Inception.<br /><br />This is the story of a man whose job is to invade people's dreams in order to plant ideas into others minds and take them for the purposes of business. Yet, his history of his work is much deeper than what people know. He now has to take on one final task with a new recruit and his best team to find one of the most important ideas that can change the modern world.<br /><br />This film is probably one of the most well put together that came out this year. The actors chosen all played their roles beautifully. Joseph Gordon Levitt was probably the best of the bunch as he always seems to astound me with all his recent work. What can be said about DiCaprio that hasn't these past few years? Ellen Page always brings her \\"A\\" game and this time it is no different. Still, this movie is not going to appeal to everyone. This movie really makes you think, and unless you pay close attention you are surly to get lost. I would realistically give Inception 3 stars just because it doesn't appeal to a mass audience. Still, the movie is well acted and well executed and it is definitely worth seeing
B003EYVXUU|5.0|What an exceptional film. This is a movie experience that lingers with you long after the credits roll. A beautifully shot cinematic experience. This remake of the Swedish \\"Let The Right One In\\" is on par with the original, which was an amazing film itself. This is the story of a bullied boy, with no friends and his daily routine into the horrors of school bullying. Who befriends a mysterious new neighbor that just moved in. Through their interactions, you see a blossoming youthful love story, while strangely horrific in a sense. Let Me In is a must see.    Director Matt Reeves (Cloverfield) did a wonderful job of taking the good elements from the original movie and keeping them similar, while also removing some elements that were \\"filler\\" or things that took away from the main focus of the movie. Kudos to Mr. Reeves and taking on this daunting project, and proving to skeptics that this is one of the great remakes in recent history along with The Departed.    The actors Kodi Smit-McPhee (Owen) and Chloe Grace Moretz (Abby) give Oscar worthy performances. They draw the audience in, and make you feel an incredible sense of sympathy for both Owen and Abby. Chloe Grace Moretz seems to be the \\"IT\\" girl right now, and although this movie wasn't a box office hit, the movie and her performance has been raved about. A stark difference to her character Mindy Macready/Hit-Girl from the movie \\"Kick-Ass\\". She has a bright future ahead of her, no doubt.    I recommend renting this movie, and if you love it (which is the case with most of the people I know), then definitely purchase this dvd/Blu-ray. I just hope the Special Features are loaded.
B003YK42LQ|4.0|I have every KOL CD ever released, and I have been listening to them from the beginning. That said, I am impressed with the depth and the sound of this album. I still expected more of the poppy sounds that made up \\"Sex is on Fire\\" and \\"Use Somebody\\", but was pleasantly surprised to hear more southern rock coming from my speakers. The Followill brothers (and cousin) have grown up, and grown into a much more mature sound, that now compliments the lead's voice, rather than make him sound like a screeching banshee as on previous albums.  Overall, very happy with this CD, and I look forward to more music from this multi-talented band of Followills.
B001KWN3Z6|5.0|I first got a hold of this album when I was 13. In fact it was the very first Joni Mitchell album I ever owned. I purchased it as a vinyl record from a thrift store, it cost me 99 cents. At the time I was just starting to write poetry and I would put the record on and just write. Joni's voice was amazing, soothing and calming. From Morning in Morgantown to The Circle Game I was enthralled. I had listened to the record so much that I had to replace it several times, by the time I was 17 I probably replaced it 10 times.<br />What makes this album so good is the thought behind every note and lyric. Joni just has this muse-like spirit about her. She wasn't afraid to put her thoughts out there whether people agreed with it or not. Now that I am older, and as I learned more about Joni Mitchell the idol worship I had for her has turned into a deep respect for her as an artist and a human. I think once her time on earth has passed she will be in the music history books as one of the greatest artists of all time.

1423101472|5.0|I really enjoyed the last Olympian. It had everything the others books had: the drama, the fighting, the romance, and the battle. In this book Percy, his friends, and the gods battle Kronos, his gang of evil cronies, and another titan whose name i can't quite remember. This book, like the other four, was well written. It was very touching how Percy and the campers forgave Silena when it was brought to like that she was the spy. I was also glad when Ethan and Luke were made heroes. It was too sad that they couldn't have saved him somehow and just killed Kronos. In the end Annabeth and Percy end up together, and Rachel, who replaced the oracle, gave another prophecy, which i guess is what the other branch-off series the heroes of Olympus is based off of.     If you loved the other percy Jackson booked, you will surely love this one.
B0040UAYI4|4.0|Recently got the eagle eye controller. Saw a video review on some website, I was interested. Been a LONG time pc gamer, just got into console. But just do not have the experience with the fumbly ps3 controller. The mouse/kb feel more natural when gaming.  Easy setup of the eec, updated firmware, just read the instructions...no brainer. Took about 20-30 minutes to get the mouse settings (logitech g500) and kb settings correct in game and on eec. Some trial and error, but can be fine tuned with some time and patience.  Recommend anyone coming from pc gaming to console get this device. You will regret NOT getting it!
B003KNDMXG|2.0|First off, let me say that this review is specifically for the *vinyl* pressing of The Archandroid, and my rating does not reflect the artistic content of this recording.  Other concerns aside, I would without hesitation award The Archandroid five stars.  I listened to this album thoroughly in digital format, and decided that it was worthy of inclusion into my vinyl library.      Imagine my disappointment when I pulled the first LP out of the sleeve, and was treated to crackles and pops of a distracting volume and frequency on the first playthrough.    I wash/brush all of my new vinyl before the first play (to remove any mold cast-off and dust that may be there), and I did the same with this record.  I thought cheapo pressings were largely a relic of the past, or a caveat emptor when buying imports.  I am sorely disappointed in the quality of this product.
B00005JLR2|5.0|Treasure Planet is a Disney animated film based on another Disney classic, Treasure Island-but with a Science Fiction twist. The story centers around Jim Hawkins(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a young adventurer, who is told the story of a space pirate's fortune located in a far-away planet. At the insistance of his Mom(Laurie Metcalf), Hawkins journeyed to the planet on the Space boat R.L.S. Legacy(a nod to Robert Louis Stevenson)with his guardian Dr. Delbert Doppler(David Hyde Pierce) and the ship's Captain, Amelia(Emma Thompson). Along the way, the crew are confronted by a hearty alien buccaneer named John Silver, who reluctantly joins the crew as they fight off rival pirates and avoid intergalatic dangers in order to find the Treasure Planet and its riches. The special features includes a classic trailer for Disney's Treasure Island and a behind-the-scenes look the the film. Treasure Planet is destined to become one of the great Disney animated classics for years to come.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|The Dark Knight is for anybody that likes action and a deep plot.  The Joker makes this movie, though it is a little annoying that he is the bad guy yet he is always two steps ahead of Batman.  Too bad Ledger isn't around for the next one.
B002ZG99TA|4.0|Tony Scott's \\"Unstoppable\\" is a nail biting, heart pounding, relentlessly exciting film. It takes most of the reliable hallmarks of the action picture - death defying stunts, crashes, explosions - and strips them to the bare essentials. There's no posturing, no big muscles and machine guns, no pompous dialogue, no padding of any kind. There's only a raw, primal adrenaline rush. The result is a film so taut and gripping that you're liable to lose the feeling in your hands from clenching the armrests on your theater's chair. It winds itself up at the start and keeps on winding until the spring is ready to break loose; at the end of it all, when the tension is finally released, you will breathe a sigh of relief ... and then want to experience it all over again. It's kind of like riding a roller coaster.    This film represents a purer, healthier attitude towards the action film. It's great entertainment, yes, but it also has both a brain and a heart at work. Rather than assault us with bursts of noise and flashes of light, we're pushed into a genuinely frightening scenario and dragged along with nothing but the hope that it will somehow turn out all right. We're actually made to feel something. Better still, we're made to care about the characters, who aren't disposable war-mongering typecasts but ordinary people thrust into an extraordinary situation. If convention dictates that the key players will become heroes, at least I can take comfort in knowing that this time around, they actually earn that distinction. And no, I don't care that the film is in all likelihood a gross exaggeration of real life events - I wanted to be thrilled, and thrilled I was.    \\"Unstoppable\\" stars Denzel Washington and Chris Pine as a pair of railroad workers. The former is Frank Barnes, a long time engineer for the Allegheny and West Virginia Railroad. The latter is Will Colson, a rookie conductor. They hit it off like oil and water, Frank and his co-workers believing that Will was hired strictly because of family connections to the union. Despite their differences, they're assigned to work a locomotive together. Frank makes it clear, perhaps a little too strenuously, that Will should ask about something if he doesn't know what to do. Will's personal problems continuously distract him throughout the day; he takes calls he shouldn't be taking, and eventually, he attaches their locomotive to too many trains. Things just don't seem to be going well.    And it will only get worse. At another station, a lazy hostler (Ethan Suplee) fails to connect an air hose on a train that's scheduled to be moved, preventing the air brakes from working. He doesn't think this will be a problem; he'll simply hook them up after parking the train on another track. Unfortunately, the switch up ahead is not set for the right track, and when he jumps off the main engine to fix it - a highly frowned upon maneuver - the improperly set throttle shifts on its own, speeding up the train to the point that he can no longer get back on. Not only is the train unmanned, it's now on the coasting faster and faster along mainline. Will and Frank are also on the mainline. And they're going in the opposite direction.    Keeping tabs on the escalating situation is yardmaster Connie Hooper (Rosario Dawson), who quickly learns that the some of the tanks on the runaway train are carrying a highly hazardous material. She and a number of other dispatchers work tirelessly to get all opposing traffic onto sidings, and this includes a train full of children on a field trip. They begin rallying the state police in the hopes that they can secure guard crossings in various cities. Connie also has to fight an uphill battle with her superior, Oscar Galvin (Kevin Dunn), a corporate typecast unwilling to entertain her idea of derailing the train in lightly populated farmland. Derailing the train would cost the company millions of dollars, and as we all know, money is more important than safety.    I will now refrain from going into detail, since that would ruin the suspense. I will only say that Frank and Will get wind of the situation and decide to stop the runaway train on their own. I will also say that, from here, the film becomes increasingly nerve wracking. Many action movies are about as predictable as a Mickey Rooney/Judy Garland backyard musical; with \\"Unstoppable,\\" there's no telling where it might go. The uncertainty, the sheer anticipation, is so palpable that you may lose your breath from gasping so much.    Action films made as well as \\"Unstoppable\\" have to be treasured, for they show that some filmmakers want to do more than merely exhilarate the audience; they also want to prove that even films about runaway trains can be smart, stylish, and powerful. Watching this film, it's obvious that serious thought went into the plot and the characters. Serious thought must have gone into casting as well, for everyone involved lends believable, engaging performances. Rosario Dawson in particular is especially good, giving her character just the right balance of professional backbone and personal concern. But most of the credit must be given to Mark Bomback for his convincing screenplay, Chris Lebenzon and Robert Duffy for their editing, and everyone who contributed to stunt work, special effects, and sound. They remembered what an action film is supposed to be.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Who does not know Facebook? Who does not know Myspace? Who does not use the services of Facebook or Myspace? Who has never used their services? In our countries and, within years in the world, practically no one and not in a life time but every year, every month, everyday. Some will say this film shows the worst side of capitalism. I will say this film shows the most realistic side of the spirit and fire of free enterprise and free enterprise, in a capitalist or socialist free market economy, is the engine of the economy and the development of a country, of a society, of masses of people and of each individual.<br /><br />The film shows marvelously how it is not the rich who achieve the best things when they are young because when you are rich and using silver spoons for breakfast and golden spoons for tea you hire the services of those who are more intelligent than you to do what you have the money to do but not the intelligence.<br /><br />It is the one who cannot put one thousand dollars on the table who has the best idea and the knowledge necessary to create vast adventures because he knows in our modern world that what is going to succeed has to be cool and cool means free, freewheeling, easy-going, with no controls and no cops, or cash desks everywhere. Everyone knows that you will not succeed in any communication enterprise if you want to cash straight away the profit you will cash in ten years but not from the simple subscribers, but from the users who use the social network you have created to pass around a commercial message wrapped up in a way that makes it palatable for the simple subscribers who hate spam and anyway do not read it. That's where the creator of Facebook and the creator of Napster were and are right.<br /><br />To liberate that communication power, a power that is virtual and real at the same time, a simulacrum for conservatives and a big leap forward for normal people, to liberate that force is to multiply the power and the force of each individual who can widen his knowledge, stretch his interests, pile up his connections and friends, accumulate his messages and exchanges. All the anti-virtual-reality proponents like Jean Baudrillard and a few others are just bitter people who regret a past that has gone, that is gone, that will never come back ever.<br /><br />Maybe those inventors are so many Lucifers but Lucifer is an angel of light and I am ready to sleep, bathe, eat, drink, work, dance, write, sing, and do many other things, with that angel of light. They are going to tell you that it makes many crimes possible or easier, and they are just from the pre-stone age of mental underdevelopment. The Internet did not invent those crimes. The Internet did not make man a criminal or a pervert. It is not because we were looking at the beautiful cherubs of the Renaissance that we became, all of us, rapists of children. And there would have been no cherubs, and the pedophiles of the past would have struck anyway and all the same.<br /><br />The film shows another element that is difficult to take, to analyze, to understand. The few people who see beyond the present and who know the technical and scientific principles that are going to change the face of the world are in this world an elite that has to defend themselves constantly against those who will try to make them work with no profit at all for themselves, I mean for those who are working, who are made to work. That explains the attitude of these people: they are afraid, they are protecting themselves, they are locked up at times in a world that is not that of ordinary people and they seem unbearable, they even try to make themselves unbearable but they are not monsters, they just need to protect their integrity and any human society is always trying to break the integrity of the weak and intelligent in order to accumulate power and riches in the hands of those who are strong and have no principles.<br /><br />This film is a must in our culture.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Créteil, CEGID

B003UBTX7C|5.0|Not much to say that hasn't already been said but I did enjoy this book as it has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing who was behind the bomb and why. If you like a good mystery that keeps you guessing then you will enjoy this book.
158234082X|5.0|This book was so great! It's like I heard Anthony Bourdain reading it to me and it was completely in his words. I laughed!
B0036WHM1E|4.0|If you like beautiful crafted two-voice songs this is a great album to have. Great melodies, temperate instrumentation and great voices. My only negative comments are that is a little too long and that most of the songs are in the same tempo.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|\\"Elena Undone\\" is a must-see film for lesbian audiences, as well as for those who simply appreciate an extremely well-made, touching love story. This film sets a new standard for what lesbian films can and should be -- well-written and well-acted, with beautiful and talented actresses, believable acting, a gripping storyline, and an unexpected but pleasing ending. Unlike many lesbian/women-loving-women films out there, \\"Elena Undone\\" is a genuinely high quality film -- professionally written and produced, and enormously appealing to those of us who crave movies that portray realistic lesbian relationships and struggles. Yet it resists being exclusively a \\"niche\\" film by being emotionally accessible and appealing to gay and straight audiences alike. I was enthralled throughout the movie and left the theater dying to have my own copy so I could watch it again! And true confession...I watched the on-line trailer at least once a day for a solid month after I saw the film!   As a loyal devotee of good film making,I cannot recommend this lovely film enough!

B001MYIXAC|1.0|Really disappointed when I sat down to watch the movie, only to find it was not the original subtitled edition as per item discription. Poorly voiced over edition which loses a lot of the movies strength and depth through the lanuage translation. Will try to find the original version eleswhere. : (
B0036EH3WU|3.0|I never watched the series while it was on television, but got hooked on Lost when I saw an episode from one of the DVDs at a friends house.  When I heard about the complete series being released and in a huge boxset, I just had to pick it up.  Now the series is great.  Action, Mystery, Drama, even some humour all wrapped up in a neat 45 minutes.  now these boxsets I'm learning, although cheaper, can sometimes come back to bite you in the butt.  I have been watching an average of 3 - 4 episodes a day, with breaks from the series every now and then, so its taking me some time to complete.  All the discs from season 1 to 3 have worked, but sometimes have glitched for unknown reasons.  I ignored these because they were very small and not worth the hassle of driving back to the store.  Moving onto season 4, I was very disappointed to find that discs 2 and 3 didn't want to work at all.  Now if I wanted to return it, I would probably have to return the whole set, if they even would take it back, and then have to watch all of seasons 1 to 3 again.  Not impressed with the way the discs are stored, in the slip sleeves.  If there is any dirt in the case, sliding the discs in and out can probably scratch them.  I personally like cases that have the center piece holding the disc in place.  My lesson learned from this is unless they offer a very collectible giftbox, I am going to avoid multiple season boxsets.
0307454541|5.0|This is the first in the series of three books and is a GREAT start.  I have also read the other two, THE GIRL WHO PLAYED WITH FIRE  and THE GIRL WHO KICKED THE HORNET'S NEST.  Each is better than the one before and they are just gripping.  (So sad that the author, Stieg Larsson, passed away at such a young age and before the books received the notoriety--#1 on all best-seller lists.
B00004TJWE|5.0|I own the original LP (vinyl) version of this album and bought it when it was originally released way back when (dating myself).  The album cover is in the shape of a tombstone.  It was the the first rock opera.  I listened to this all the time when it was released and was not a big fan of Tommy when it came out comparing it to S.F. Sorrow.  My original LP version was in stereo and when I saw this Snapper CD reissue I snatched it up immediately years ago.  I knew something was missing (the stereo).  I figured that was the only version but didn't care since I wanted a CD version to burn listen to.  I now come to find out that there is a stereo Snapper version as well!  I just downloaded it and it is amazing.  Just as I remember the LP version (only better now!!).  I guess it pays to read reviews of CDs you already own.  I would not have known it was also released in stereo. Get the stereo version if you have the mono version, it is well worth it!!!!!!
1593272200|5.0|This is the perfect computer book as far as I am concerned. It's well rounded, complete, thorough, easy to read, precise, interesting, helpful, useful, enjoyable and it has a green cover to boot. I highly recommend it to everyone who is interested in computers and not intimidated by programming concepts. It is technical, but the the writing is not dry.
1439177783|5.0|I usually don't read non-fiction and didn't have any interest in the eating disorder topic. But I am very intrigued by Portia and wanted to learn more about her. This book is so well written and took me on a fascinating journey through the inner workings of her mind. It felt so sincere. She made me wish I knew her and had been there for her, helping in the dark, painful times. That's true writing talent. I couldn't have asked for anything better.

0385342047|3.0|I am a big fan of Sophie Kinsella, including the Shopaholic series, but this book indicates it's time for a new heroine.  Good-hearted, overspender Becky was cute and endearing in her early twenties, but not so much now that she's 29 and has a daughter.  Why would she still daydream multiple times in the book about being \\"The Girl Who. . .\\", when she's not even a girl anymore?  I winced more than once throughout the novel at Becky's childish antics and lies, and I found myself wishing that she would just grow up.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|I pre-ordered my copy of this,the three disc version of Avatar and received it promptly as usual.You all know what the set contains so I won't bore you with those unnecessary details.What you SHOULD know is what appallingly bad packaging Fox has created for this release.<br />When you get it and unwrap it you first have to remove the covering sleeve which encompasses the area the discs sit in.This can be tricky and in fact I had to turn the set on its side and shake it to get the enclosure out.Once out it folds out like a thick book revealing a fancy and neat looking area which are marked by three different black ends.These ends are what you pull out to get at each disc,which only go out far enough to reveal about 3/4 of the particular disc you are after.If you are familiar with the three disc set of \\"Wall-E\\"(see my review on that) these \\"hide and seek\\" sleeves are similar to those.The big difference is that the \\"Wall-E\\" set discs sit in a slight depression.The Avatar discs sit as is,flat on the pull out;no protection and the odds for future scuffing and/or accidental falling out when trying to replace them are very,very high indeed.<br />As soon as I saw this I said out loud \\"These are going to be scratched\\" and of course I found scuff marks and scratches on the first two discs.The third was the only one in good condition but I obviously didn't shell out the bucks for one disc,so I unfortunately had to return the entire set.I don't intend to flog this dead horse repeatedly so I have asked for a refund.<br />It is a fancy schmansy looking set to be sure,but like the myriad of other such DVD sets out there that suck the consumer in strictly by their packaging(such as the complete I Love Lucy,The Flintstones,et al),the looks quickly lose their sweetness when the rubber hits the road and marked discs turn out to be the norm instead of the exception.Not one ounce of practicality are in sets like this.This Avatar set falls into that unfortunate category and I am giving it the wide PASS it deserves.<br />With this information at your disposal I hope each and everyone of you will carefully check your discs for any tell tale marks.If you order it I wish you the best of luck.<br />I know this will not be the last Avatar release Fox will churn out.One can only hope that the next one will be more like like Fox's original Alien Quadrilogy set which was telescoping but with separate plastic holders or better yet in individual snap cases or slim packs.Shame on Fox!ASS it deserves.  With this information at your disposal I hope each and everyone of you will carefully check your discs for any tell tale marks.If you order it I wish you the best of luck.

0385342039|5.0|This is probably the best of Sophie Kinsella's novels so far, in my opinion.  It's creative, romantic, a mystery, and comedic all at the same time.  The plot had the usual predictable romantic foils and triumphs, but the unexpected twists were delightful and caught me by surprise.  Like others, I was a bit sad at the ending and kind of wished she had left room for a sequel.  I'm looking forward to Ms. Kinsella's next novels.
B00428ZRFY|5.0|I love this album. It is absolutely refreshing and more upbeat since her Rated R album. This album takes on a vibrant and loud tone, simply colorful. My favorite tracks are 1. S&M, 3. Cheers, 4. Fading, 6. Man Down, 7. Raining Men, 8. Complicated, and 11. Love the Way You Lie. I think that this is way that Rihanna is supposed to present herself as an artist, and this album was an easy play through from start to finish.
B003XOAJ6K|5.0|Look-  i assume that because you are looking at Big Thing on the site that you have some interest in the product so lets start there.  This release is a great remaster and collected edition of this under appreciated LP.  I was a huge fan of the original release and own all the singles and product available for Duran and this album that being said, i still was looking forward to this release because everything from this whole era of the band is included single versions, remixes, promos, and of course the videos, a unreleased show from the era is additionally available on itunes for the hard-core Durannies out there.  There are even a couple of never released things here to sweeten the purchase a little.  I buy alot of these remastered releases and the quality of the Duran series is outstanding.  I only hope EMI continues the series into Liberty and through Thank You if only for the archival like quality of the packages.  If you are looking then this one is a must have!!!!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|It's been a while since I've seen VAN HELSING, and I guess time does sometimes foster a different perspective. Seems that, over the years, my ill will towards this film has waned some, to the extent that I actually enjoyed watching this action horror film, just now, just now. And I've always thought this film was less soulless than, say, THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN, perhaps Sean Connery's most irredeemable flick. Anyway, this is a mixed message sort of review.<br /><br />Some say he's a holy man. Others paint him a murderer. I guess even Bram Stoker got it wrong. What this Van Helsing is, is a legendary monster hunter, and he works covertly under the auspices of the Vatican. His latest mission dispatches him to the remote fastness of Romania, the Mecca for frightful supernatural beasties. There, Van Helsing will hunt his most formidable quarry: Count Dracula. He also meets lovely Anna Valerious, the last in line of a damned family that had sworn to kill Dracula and barred from Heaven until that deed is done. Cue the spectacular action and CG. Cue the dreary plot. And if you can justify the cohabitation of the cool action with the plodding story, then good on you. I have lowered the bar, I've learned to adjust, and I do like the film better now. I still can't say the same for Connery's folly.<br /><br />On one hand, if you've enjoyed those old-school Universal horror flicks featuring Dracula, Frankenstein's Monster, and the Werewolf, one draw may be that this movie strives at an homage to them. Each of these terrifying monsters plays a role. On that same hand, if you like your Kate Beckinsale, well, she's here and sporting a funky Romanian accent. On the other hand, the nerve-deadening storyline puts a damper on things; it trudges along. And dear, winsome Kate - while she does her best - could only do so much with her underwritten role. She and Hugh Jackman exhibit the rapport of two dandruff flakes languishing on a poor sap's shoulder.<br /><br />I mentioned that the action is spectacular, and it is. But even the action in THE LEAGUE OF EXTRAORDINARY GENTLEMEN was pretty cool. VAN HELSING is so determined to jump from one CG-driven action spectacle to another that it abandons good storytelling in its wake. VAN HELSING is flash and style with not much substance, pulse-pounding stunts with no refinement. And, yeah, I know, sometimes it doesn't matter that the script is weak because the f/x and the fighty fights are just that good. But, man, when the script is this weak and ponderous? And, I guess, it comes down, too, to the acting performances... and I'm eyeing Hugh Jackman now. This guy has shown natural charm and wit before (his awesome opening number at the Oscars is just one example). But, as Van Helsing, Jackman is so relentlessly dour and wooden, we don't get a chance to glimpse his true personality. So, to boil it down, this flick is Van Helsing pretty much tangling with the usual rolodex of feature creatures, and there's also a half-formed romance with Beckinsale. If you like your fighty fights, this'll do ya.<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought that Van Helsing's assistant, Carl, was a fun character. Carl is pretty much the sole fount of humor here.<br /><br />There are some pretty robust special features on this DVD: 2 feature commentaries; \\"Explore Dracula's Castle\\" takes you on a 360 degree tour of several of VAN HELSING's sets; \\"The Legend of Van Helsing\\" is a rundown of the character as portrayed in films; \\"Bringing the Monsters to Life\\" focuses on the Industrial Light & Magic folks, as they, thru pencil sketches and digital composition, reveal how the monsters were crafted; \\"You Are In the Movie\\" grants the viewer the actor's perspective, thanks to strategically placed miniature cameras; \\"Play the Van Helsing Game\\" - the DVD pops into your Xbox and allows you to play the game's first level; the movie trailers; and 5 and a half minutes of goofy outtakes (\\"I give you...Van Halen!\\").ed that the action is spectacular, and it is.

Once began, this is almost impossible to lay down.<br />Layer under layer under layer, it compels the reader to continue - almost to the point of forgetting the outside world.<br />One of the ten best I have read in the past year.<br /><br />Russ, A confirmed bibliophile.
0385737424|2.0|I found this book to be very boring. I had to force myself to read it. It's definitely a book for children not young adults.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|If you are reading this review you likely already know and love this classic movie. Since I grew up with this version, I do prefer it to the newest remake although that one is well done, too. In any case, if you have never seen this one just save yourself some time, stop reading this, and buy it!<br /><br />What you are probably interested in is the quality of the blu-ray. I have seen this movie many times on TV and on prior DVD release and this blu-ray is certainly the best presentation I have seen. That said, it did not \\"blow me away\\" the way the remaster of [[ASIN:B001UHOWXI It's a Wonderful Life [Blu-ray]]] did. The picture just looks a little bit muted with whites not quite white and the whole picture just tending toward being a bit dark. The level of detail also does not match what I have seen on other blu-rays.<br /><br />I did some searching on the internet and on blu-ray.com did confirm that this is a new scan in HD since I was not even certain of that by watching it - and that site also noted limitations might well be related to the source material - and that is likely the case. I did not have a chance to compare it to a prior DVD - I'll be honest, I couldn't find it! As my wife would/will say, time to tidy up and organize DVDs! if I locate the DVD I'll compare directly and post an update.<br /><br />It is important to note this film is presented in the correct aspect ratio - this means that if you watch it on a wide screen TV then black bars at the sides are present which are normal and proper. It is also notable that the colorized version is NOT included if that was of interest to you. Prior reviewers were very upset about that but as of this writing the currently shipping case does not claim that a colorized version is included and the Amazon listing appears to have been updated as well.<br /><br />All in all though I am not awestruck by this disc it still gets 5 stars as a wonderful classic movie and likely the best transfer possible from limited source material. I am looking forward to sharing it with my 5 and 7 year old kids!to sharing it with my 5 and 7 year old kids!
1554685133|5.0|I never saw the movie and did not even know this was a book until I saw it inadvertantly at the library.  Since I heard such great things about the movie, why not read the book?  I do not regret it.  I loved the format of the book, weaving stories of the main character's life by the questions on the show.  There are some parts in the novel that made me laugh out loud.  And just when I thought I knew how this would end (we all know he won the show, right??), there awaits a pleasant surprise!  Although this was a quick and entertaining read, by no means was it a light read.  It dealt with the poorest of the poor in India, ranging from stealing food from a trash bin to an abandoned child suffering from rabies to sodomy as a interrogation tact from the police.  Another story that makes me see just how fortunate I am.  I will watch the movie now.  I have seen reviews on here that comment how the book is not as good.  I, on the other hand having just read the book, can only hope that the movie will be even half as good!
0345479092|5.0|Her approach really resonated for me, and the EASY pattern has worked so well for my baby.  I didn't do everything she suggested (like the dreamfeed) but ended up realizing she was right and wishing I had implemented her suggestions earlier.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|I happen to love Norah Jones' voice and mellow, jazzy style.  I believe this CD showcases these attributes well.  Additionally, she is an adept collaborator, flexible enough in style to blend well with a variety of musical partners, true enough to herself to not be subsumed by them.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This item fits all my lenses and tripod attaches well.  Should it be a 5 that can be debatable, as it is what the description says so would give a 5 star that the description is not a lie. The item works as it should and have no trouble carrying my camera up and down the trails. I used to have to carry over shoulder and if I brought tripod would have to carry that separately. This made carrying camera equipment much easier and a bit more compfortable while protecting my valuable lens and equiptment.
B003EYVXT6|3.0|Splice is a movie about a couple, Adrian Brody and Sarah Polley, who are genetic engineers. They decide to splice genes with human DNA and end up with an almost human like creature which has amphibian and bird flight capabilities. Against their better judgment, they decide to keep the baby and study its lifespan. Obviously all good intentions are fraught with dangers and the movie shows us the dangers of humans trying to play good.<br />If you have very low expectations, which I did, you will be pleasantly surprised. The creature turns against the humans but has a personality and the movie tries to delve in to its psyche. This Frankenstein type of saga is watchable. Three stars. 11/15/10
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My family loved this movie.  It was so sweet and is the true meaning of faithful companion.  I am glad that  I purchased this one b/c it's the type of feel good movie that you'll want to watch over and over again.    Terri Campbell

B000KKPN5C|5.0|I'm an amateur photographer and needed a speed light because the built-in flash in my Nikon d40x is sometimes not powerful enough for indoor shots. Otherwise, I rarely have need for extra lighting. I originally purchased Nikon sb600 which is a superb flash, but too much for casual shooting needs especially for over $200.  I picked up an sb400 after reading reviews and this speed light is perfect for my shooting needs. It is cost effective and runs on 2 AA batteries. I've tested the speed light in a darkened room with only artificial light streaming in the window. I was really surprised at how powerful this little light actually can be. It's the size of a cellphone and takes little room in my LowePro slingshot bag. Due to small size, you won't notice much weight on your camera. The reflector tilts from 0 to 60, 75 and 90 degrees to allow some bounce. If you are like me and occasionally need additional lighting, buy it. If you shoot portraits or wedding photos on a regular basis, then go for sb600 which has more features and suitable for pro shooting needs.
B0013LPS7U|4.0|\\"Boy\\" is the debut release from U2, one of the greatest bands in the world from the 80's on.  The original album was released on October 20th of 1980, but this particular item is the Deluxe Edition, which was released on July 21st of 2008.  In some cases a debut album defines a group's sound, but in my opinion \\"Boy\\" probably sounds the least like U2 of any of their albums.  That is not to say that it doesn't sound like U2 at all, or that the songs were written by anyone outside the band, but instead that one can hear how other groups influenced them more on this album than on their later albums where they have better defined their own sound.    The original album is on Disc One of this two-disc set.  The first track is \\"I Will Follow\\", and unlike some of the other pieces it would be a song which helps define U2s sound.  It is a song about  a mother's unconditional love, written after his own mother had passed away.  \\"Twilight\\" is the first song which takes on the major theme of the album, which is adolescence.  \\"An Cat Dubh\\" (Black Cat) is a song which demonstrates the contrast between beauty and danger and it is linked to \\"Into the Heart\\" a song which is more about the innocence of childhood.  \\"Out of Control finishes off the first half of the original album and it deals with the feeling that one has no control over one's life.    \\"Stories for Boys\\" starts the second half of the album and based on a quote from Bono it is a reaction against popular heroes and images that are impossible to emulate.  \\"The Ocean\\" is a short piece which seems to be Bono reflecting on his own life and his desire to change the world.  \\"A Day Without Me\\" is a song about the suicide of Ian Curtis, the Joy Division singer.  It is also the first song the group recorded.  \\"Another Time, Another Place\\" is about teenage sex according to Bono.  \\"The Electric Co.\\" is about electric convulsion therapy which happened to a friend of the band.  The album closes (if one ignores the 34 second track which has not title) with \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\" a song about the struggles of boyhood, and a reference to \\"Lord of the Flies\\" which is a book about the same subject.     The bonus CD in the Deluxe edition offers fans some additional treasures.  It opens with a slightly different version of \\"I Will Follow\\".  This was the first attempt at creating the final mix.  Next up is the single \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\" which was released in May of 1980, and it is followed the \\"Touch\\" single which appeared with it.  Next there are a couple of outtakes from the Boy sessions \\"Speed of Life\\" and \\"Saturday Night\\", the latter of which would eventually appear as \\"Fire\\" on their \\"October\\" album.  Next is a rare instrumental \\"Things to Make and Do\\" which was part of their live shows, giving Bono's vocals a rest.  This version was the B-Side for the \\"A Day Without Me\\" single.  Next up are the single versions which appeared on \\"3\\", \\"Out Of Control\\", \\"Stories For Boys\\", and \\"Boy-Girl\\".  These are followed by the single versions of \\"Another Day\\" and \\"Twilight\\".  Next up are live versions of \\"Boy-Girl\\", \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\" at the Marquee Club in London, and finishing with a live version of \\"Cartoon World\\" which was broadcast live from the National Boxing Stadium in Dublin.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|Okay, not your typical Kid Rock but he took some time to reflect on his life and wanted to put an album out to share his thoughts.  He is turning 40, but he is not dead yet.  Give him a break. I think all artist stretch themselves and put out something uncharacteristic of their persona at one time or another. There are some keepers on the album for sure. For $3.99 for the entire album, I'm not complaining.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|I actually bought a pair of these about three years ago when I first heard about them in a magazine. They actually really help with the new style of the R2/L2 button on the Sixaxis/DS3. For some odd reason Sony decided to change the R2/L2 into triggers, but instead of making the buttons concave they kept them convex. This seriously causes your finger to slip off the back buttons depending on how hard you press, how long its pressed, and how sweaty your fingers are. These triggers absolutely fixed this problem by curving upwards at the ends, so not only does it keep your fingers from slipping but it gives them a great grip. They are easy to assemble, you just clip them on, they snap into place on the back buttons. The design is great too, same type of plastic, molds perfectly, and has the number imprint you won't even be able to tell their aftermarket third party peripherals. I finally bought a second pair for my second controller because I got tired of replacing them every time the controller needs charging. After using them for three years on all types of game, I can't use the Sixaxis/DS3 without them. Everyone should get a pair of these triggers, don't even doubt your purchase they are completely worth it.

B0010SKUYM|5.0|I so enjoyed this story. The pace which some reviewers had a problem with I found engaging. Hints of things to happen kept me on edge and I remain there waiting for book two.<br /><br />What I also enjoyed was how a great person views themselves. At the time of a great or heroic act it's just what happened. I almost hope there is only two books, but I don't see how with such a large story that is hinted at. This is because 4 YEARS waiting on book two. Release in early '11 last I read.<br /><br />A broad engaging tale just barely begun in book one. Wonderful writing style and original magic that is not odd or silly. New magic lately is really cool or silly in fantasy. PR can write.

1400079144|1.0|This book drags on for over 600 pages. And \\"drags\\" is the perfect word. There's a sea-anchor here that Dan Brown uses to slow the pace to a mind numbing speed.   His characters lecture each other for our supposed benefit.  Characters describe important discoveries, \\"then he saw it.\\" And we are kept in the dark. This is supposed to be suspenseful, but it's really just annoying and amateurish on Dan Brown's part.  He lies to the reader.  He misdirects the reader to stall for time. (Time equaling a dozen more useless pages.)    I can't wait for the movie because it'll actually be an improvement.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Excellent package; nice design; elegant and great protection for the disks.  Sound and video are supreme so if it does not play don't blame the DVD: either update the software or buy a newer player.  Several versions of the movie coming in the package; technical details; information etc never seen before scenes.  No one is buying 3D TV's so why should they waste money to put the 3D version of the movie in the stores? It is a non sense so do not expect any big movie title in the shelves until late next year when the industries reaches an agreement about 3D formatting.  Remember HD vs blu-ray (or Toshiba vs Sony)?  Do not hesitate and buy it.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|Like many of this album's reviewers, I can claim to have been a fan for years.  I can also claim to have eagerly awaited this album release.  However, unlike many of the faithful, I think that it must be said that this album features some of the worst vocals I have ever heard.  From anyone.  That they are from Josh Groban, whose baritone I think is undescribably beautiful, is a severe disappointment.  The vocal tracks outreach his ability in the upper ranges.  At points it is almost physically painful to listen to him stretch in an attempt approach the notes.  The fact that he fails to achieve that goal at times is even worse.  After all, if he can't hit the vocals in the studio, I don't even want to imagine how some of the live performances will go.  Add to that the simplistic lyrics of some of the songs - the worst of which Josh did not pen, thank goodness - and you get, in my opinion, an album that is best left on the shelf.  (And, as a fan, you have no idea how much it pains me to say that.)
B000002GBK|5.0|Talking to a friend about the music on Albums..(yes I'm that old)   I made it known that this one had vanished from my home.What a wonderful   Moment to be told were we could get it! The music is done with multable   instruments and the story is easy to understand. You will be humming a long   time after wards. My fave is \\"Lady of the Lake\\".

1439133948|4.0|A welcome return to the Miles Vorkosigan universe begins not with a bang but a whimper, as Miles stumbles in pitch blackness through a through a huge mazelike underground cryogenic storage facility, between rows of thousands of frozen people. To make matters worse, he has just narrowly escaped an attempted kidnapping and an allergic reaction to the knockout gas which his would-be abductors used has left him reeling and suffering from hallucinations ...<br /><br />At its best, the Miles Vorkosigan SF saga is one of the most amusing comedy science fiction series ever written. This is the eleventh Miles Vorkosigan adventure, and if it isn't the funniest or the best book in the series - in my opinion both those places are claimed by the ninth book, \\"[[ASIN:0671578278 A Civil Campaign  (Miles Vorkosigan Adventures)]]\\" - it is nevertheless both exciting and entertaining.<br /><br />Be warned however that the theme of this book is a bit more somber than most of the rest of the series.<br /><br />The first hardback edition of this book (ISBN 978-1-4391-3394-1) also comes with a Vorkosigan Universe CD which includes the full text of every novel in the series, and a host of supporting material including interviews with Lois McMaster Bujold and the index/concordance to the series, \\"The Vorkisigan Companion.\\"<br /><br />This book represents a welcome return to the series after a gap of several years, both between publication and in the internal chronology of the stories. It begins about seven years after the start of the previous book, \\"[[ASIN:0743436121 Diplomatic Immunity]]\\" and Miles's and Ekaterin's eldest children, who were born on the last page of that book, are now a precocious \\"five going on six.\\"<br /><br />Emperor Gregor has sent Miles to the extraordinary world of Kibou-Daini, where the main industry is cryogenic freezing. Almost everyone, when they contract a serious illness or approach death from old age, or sometimes even before that,  has themselves frozen in thehope that when they are thawed out a hundred or more years later their medical problem, or that of aging, will have been solved.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both for the individual \\"patrons\\" who have themselves frozen, and for the planet whose entire economy, politics and society has been warped by the over-dominance of the cryogenics industry, this particular dream of immortality carries a major sting in the tail.<br /><br />WhiteChrys, one of the Cryogenics corporations which dominates Kibou-Daini, is trying to set up a branch on Komarr, one of the three worlds of the Barrayaran Empire. Unfortunately for them, one of the wealthy Komarrans who they sought to invest in this scheme, and who thought it was very fishy, is the great aunt of Gregor's Empress, Laisa. As Lord Auditor Miles Vorkosigan has personal experience of crogenic storage and revival (having been through it when he was hit by a needle grenade in [[ASIN:0330334220 Mirror Dance (A Vorkosigan Adventure)]]) he is the obvious choice to find out what WhiteChrys are up to. So Miles and his bodyguard, Armsman Roic, are sent to investigate under the guise of attending a conference.<br /><br />By the time Miles has finished poking his nose into every dark corner on Kibou-Daini, either to defend Barrayaran interests or in pursuit of his own idealistic crusades, the planet will never be the same again ...<br /><br />Be warned however that it isn't just crygenics in this book which packs a sting in the tail: there is also a huge shock at the very end which will be a bombshell not just for Miles but also for anyone who loves the characters in the series.<br /><br />The Miles Vorkosigan stories, and four other books set in the the same future universe, can stand on their own. However, a number of them, of which this is one, will give you something extra if you have previously read some of Bujold's books set earlier on the same timeline.<br /><br />For example, someone who has not read the earlier books in the seriesis unlikely to fully appreciate the enormity of the last three words of the main text of the book, in the way that regular Bujold readers will. (Sorry if that comes over a bit Dephic, I'm trying to refer to the shock ending of this volume without giving away what that ending is.) The epilogue consists of five drabbles - stories of exactly a hundred words - and I don't think you can appreciate any of them without having read the earlier books.<br /><br />If you have not previously met Lord Miles Vorkosigan, he is 1) a brilliant intriguer who at one stage was juggling at least three identities; 2) physically very small, having been injured in his mother's womb by poison gas;  3) a former spy for Imperial Barrayan security, former mercenary admiral and present \\"Imperial Auditor\\"; 4) finally married after spending most of the first nine books looking for a wife; and 5) hysterically funny to read about.<br /><br />The full sequence of books in this Universe is as follows. The chronologically first tale of the bioengineered quaddies and how Leo Graf helped them free themselves from slavery, which happened about 239 years before this book, is given in<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0671653989 Falling Free]]\\"<br /><br />The story of the romance between Miles' parents is given in the two books:<br /><br />\\"Shards of Honour\\"<br />\\"Barrayar\\"<br /><br />also published together in one volume as \\"[[ASIN:0671877496 Cordelia's Honor]].\\"<br /><br />The Miles Vorkosigan adventures are:<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:0743468406 The Warrior's Apprentice (Vorkosigan)]]\\"<br />\\"[[ASIN:0671720147 The Vor Game]]\\"<br />\\"[[ASIN:0671720937 Borders of Infinity]]\\"<br />\\"[[ASIN:2290352578 Cetaganda]]\\"<br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\"<br />\\"Mirror Dance\\"<br />\\"Memory\\"<br />\\"Komarr\\"<br />\\"A Civil Campaign\\"<br />\\"Diplomatic Immunity\\"<br />\\"Cryoburn\\"<br /><br />The next one, featuring Mile's cousin Ivan, is due out in November 2012 and is called<br /><br />\\"[[ASIN:1451638450 Captain Vorpatril's Alliance]].\\"<br /><br />There is a separate adventure for Miles' friend Elli Quinn, called:<br /><br />\\"Ethan of Athos\\"<br /><br />Note that there are also a set of omnibus editions which between them contain all the books in the Vorkosigan Universe prior to \\"Cryoburn\\" - I have already mentioned the first of these, Cordelia's Honour, and the others are<br /><br />Young Miles<br />Miles Errant<br />Miles in love<br />Miles, Mutants and Mayhem<br /><br />There are also some Miles short stories, such as \\"Winterfair Gifts.\\"<br /><br />All these books are excellent and strongly recommended.
B001G8XON0|5.0|I'm not a fan of musicals; got this film for my daughter.  She has a standard DVD version too.  The Blu-ray accentuates the colorful sets that were given a lot of attention in the production of this film.  Some of the dance scenes are simply spectacular and the sound is outstanding on high-quality sound equipment.  Much of the music is popular songs from the recent past that have been reworked in very good ways.  The romantic, bohemian love story is entertaining, Kidman and McGregor do a very good job, and some of the supporting characters are great -- the Count is soooo funny, even after several viewings of the movie.  I'm glad my daughter turned me on to this film, I've had a lot of fun watching it a few times.  The Blu-ray version is the way to go on this one; worth the extra few bucks.
6305127646|5.0|\\"The Saint\\" is a good movie that has some romance thrown in with action and adventure. Kilmer and Shue are good together, they act in sync with each other, which I really like because otherwise the plot may be good but you don't see a connection with the characters. The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue is so strong, and I do not see why the critics reviews did not like this movie. This movie is a keeper, I am going to put it in my collection of favorite movies.     I really like the scenery and the neat gadgets that Kilmer's character, Simon Templar, had. The love story between the characters is what grabbed my attention from the beginning of the movie. The way that Kilmer's character could change his appearance, and his accents was interesting too. The dialogue was good, and there was also a good balance of suspense and romance in the movie. There was the right about of both to make this movie one of my favorites. In my opinion this movie has 5 stars.
0452289963|4.0|I must admit, it is NOT an easily digestible book. Prepare to be faced by  long old English sentences full of dense information. I had to reread some sentences many times to really get what the author was trying to explain. But once you understand what he wants to say, you can raise your awareness to a great degree.    So it's not an easy read, but if you take time to understand it, you will be highly rewarded.
0312360258|2.0|Oh man, where to start with this book. I didn't like this book. I thought Zoey was very judgemental and whiney. She and her friends talk about people behind their back and even gives them names. She doesn't really care when a boy is used by the dark daughter group, because he falls a sleep in class? I though the Aphrodite character was completely over the top. She was the villian and i guess they wanted us to hate her, but I ended up just feeling sorry for her because I thought she was nuts. The Neferet character is an interesting one. I'm not sure if she like humans as much as she acts like she does. Also the way she ripped that girls necklace right off her neck shows that she not very understanding. Now on that \\"dreamboat\\" (gag) himself Erik Night. We first meet him when Aphrodite is going \\"down town\\" on him in the hallway. Thats are intro to both characters. Nice, huh?  He's eighter this biggest idiot or he just gose where the power goes. There are some good things in the books. I think that they are working towards a storyline. Unlike other books, I think that they know where they going. I'm going to try to read Betrayed and hope that some character grow up and stop saying things like...poopie, well hell, and hags from hell. If hear any of this, I'm out.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|Josh's enormous fan base (of which I consider myself a member) will ensure this album rockets to the upper echelons of the charts but it won't be deserved. Illuminations is a self indulgent, poorly orchestrated, mis-directed mish mash of songs with nasally vocals that are actually quite overbearing and difficult to listen to. And don't even get me started on the lyrics!    This is not the time in Josh's career for him to get on his own personal hobby horse unless he wants to start escaping all that he has achieved and built up to this point. A radical scaling back of the Josh Groban sound that we have become used to actually leaves his vocal range and quality of tone appear distinctly lacking.    This is like an album from a theatrical wannabe at the start of their career, not knowing in which direction they want to go and so, tries to cover all bases - a bit of folk, a few foreign language tracks (which are unbearable to listen to - unlike previous efforts), a few dirgy indie type tracks and a hymn! Oh and a single for radio.    Poor old Josh - this recording is just low on good quality songs. I'm sure he must be at a personal/professional crossroads to have ever decided that the public should spend their hard-earned cash on this offering. Sadly, another album like this and my love affair with the music of Josh Groban will be over for good.    Let's hope for a return to past form on the next release. As for this one, my advice to casual observers would be, sample the songs first (30 seconds will be enough in most cases, they don't get any better) and save your dollars/pounds for something else.

B003HTPHSQ|5.0|Love this cd - first time listening wasn't so sure, but in listening 2nd time, decided it just takes a bit more time to get over her voice which is a little high pitched for the blues.  Now I love it, I've never before heard her put so much feeling into any song as she does each and every on on this cd. She has truly found her nitch with the blues on this cd.  Great musicians accompany her.

006091307X|3.0|At times humourous, packed with information (often obscure) and interspersed with a collection of disparate characters, this short novel should be a classic but for me it was too clever for its own good. Was Pynchon poking fun at Americans' obsessive love for all things American in creating the town of San Narcisus? Was he satirising the then budding boom in American's seeking psychotherapy by creating an ex Nazi psychotherapist called Dr Hilarius? Pynchon manages to ask lots of questions but provide few answers and that may be his point but for me I would prefer something more tangible. This book reminded me of a painting which was entirely black apart from in the centre a small white question mark. Clever but not greatly appetising for the viewer. The absurd character names might mean something to Pynchon but Mike Fallopian registers no nuances for me and I would have preferred if he called Oedipa, Electra.

First off, Kid rock is one of my favorite singers so this will be jaded.  I thought the songs were great.  Nothing here that'll break as hard as all summer long or amen but, it is an overall winner cd.  Get it, and you will not regret it.

B000VBIEXS|5.0|Last week being stuck in traffic for nearly 20mins, I felt it was a good time to enjoy some music. Cueing-up the iPod to `Brian Salad Surgery' it was a rock-out beyond belief hearing a good portion of `Karn Evil 9' (I have the DVD-A, which is incredible). I know many would agree that Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Tarkus and Trilogy had been (and remains) monumental works (songs within `Black Moon' & `In The Hot Seat' notable as well), and these have been analyzed, critiqued, digested and enjoyed many years over but I would say that `Brian Salad Surgery' was (is) light-years ahead of it's time, a powerful work. There is so much content to be explored here that a casual listen only scratches the surface. `Brian Salad Surgery' is like the pinnacle atop the mountain, inviting exploration and I think it has much to offers to those in quest for many, many years to come.<br /><br />Why So Many Versions? The answer isn't that Keith Emerson, Lake and Palmer (or others) are out to build a massive retirement fund. Technology has vastly improved and the quest for that perfect remastered reissue prevails. Sometimes, a remastering house project may fall short of expectations and the artist may need to shop around again for a better manufacturer of his work. Sometimes it involves record label contracts and the need to wait-out the contract in order to get it remastered by someone else. Either way, the effort of most to remaster ones life's work is more about quality, not quantity.<br /><br />The best to date remaster's I have are: the DVD-A release, Rhino/WEA 2000 [UPC-081227598099]; 35th Anniversary, K2-HD Coding JVCP-63175, 2005 [UPC-4988002489909]; I have yet to audition Shout Factory, Bonus Tracks, 2007 [UPC-826663106428] but will post an update.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This album was a gift to me from my sons who listen mainly to hip-hop. I knew nothing of these guys, and had my reservations. I think that the best music reveals itself more with each listen, and I must say, this is some great stuff. Other reviews here state the case of greatness well....musicians with a real passion for what they're doing, with a deep understanding of their genre and who and what has come before. You hear a host of blues and rock influences brought together in the Black Keys' own honest and genuine sound. I'm glad to see so many reviews full of praise. It's interesting that they would be accused of being White Stripes wanna-bees, as one reviewer stated. I don't know who in the music world chooses blues as their ticket to wealth and success. If it isn't passionate and real, everyone's going to know it. This is honest and gritty, the real deal. Hopefully the Black Key's touch of garage band-stripped down-spontaneous sound will bring Blues music to the attention of younger audiences.

B0042JTDXK|4.0|Josh's voice is always superb, so that's a given. I'm a big fan of his classical sound, but not so much of the overdone, predictable, soaring violins of past recordings. Thankfully, the instrumentation on this album is a real pleasure, complimenting the songs perfectly. As for the songs, some of them I loved but some had lyrics with a little too much indecisive angst for my taste. Then was one I really disliked: Galileo. Josh does a fine job with it, but the lyrics seem amateurish to me.  And I really, really wish he'd put his cover of Randy Newman's Feels Like Home on the CD instead of an extra on i-tunes. It shows what isn't on this CD: Josh singing softly, tenderly, and simply the pristine, spare lyrics of a great songwriter.

B001AQO3QA|1.0|Even with the Blu-Ray Deal price of $70.00 dollars, its still way too high considering you're being forced to buy two of the worst movies ever made along with two of the best films ever made.  This is Fox once again trying to screw us into buying the films in the franchise that sucked.  This price needs to be cut in half to be realistic, even the Back to the Future trilogy wasn't this much.  Plus, the transfers are grainy and poorly done, without any consultation to the directors of these films.  I find it shameful they would release them in Blu-Ray this way, and then spit on the product they are selling with a poor quality transfer, and attempt to rob us with the high price to boot.  Screw Fox, and wait for them to break this set up into individual releases.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|The remaster edition of the original album is truly exceptional. The guitars have been mixed a little bit louder than the original, which makes sense to me, since this is a guitar album for the most part.<br /><br />The movie 'The Making Of...' is a beautiful and passionate account of what happened between the end of the Born to Run success, the law suit agains Mike Appel, and the completion of this masterpiece of an album. The movie includes interviews with all members of the band, including the late Danny Federici (segments of his interview were recorded in 2008), produces and recording engineers (including Mike Appel on the settlement of the law suit), and also other members of the E Street Band who were not around in 1978 (Patty Scialfa and Nils Lofgren). The movie disc includes additional live material, some on stage on live venues, other in Bruce's home recording studio with the band.<br /><br />Then, you get the double CD called 'The Promise', with plenty of outtakes that were never released before, nor in the Tracks box set, or in other 'illegal' bootlegs that have been circulating. It is good to have them all available.<br /><br />Then you also get a live show of the band in Asbury Park performing the album in its entirety. The sound and picture quality of this show are absolutely perfect. Adam Raised a Cain and Racing in the Streets are, in my humble opinion, the peak moments of a perfect rock show.<br /><br />Finally, there comes the Live show, which I have not seen yet. (I will post my comments here once I do).<br /><br />This box set is presented in a luxurious package with a reproduction of one of Bruce's notebook with his notes and many pictures I had never seen before.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this box set is worth every penny, and Bruce fans and rock fans alike will be happy to get this and enjoy the many hours of pure rock satisfaction. 5 stars!<br /><br />p.s.

0375413405|5.0|After reading this book it is easy to see what all the hype is about. The recipes are extremely delicious, with tons of easy to understand information. The books walks you up step by step though skill levels in an easy to fallow progression of ever harder recipes.
0385342047|3.0|I'm afraid the Shopaholic series has reached its end. The writing seemed tired and forced, and the characters weren't very well developed, either. I realize that this is not meant to be serious reading (I even bought it for some mindless brain fluff) but this book left me seriously disappointed. What was once refreshing and amusing is now tired and dull.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|It is typical Wes Anderson (Royal Tannenbaums, Life Aquatic, Rushmore, etc) . We love his style - albeit unoriginal. The actors are not bored - the technique is called \\"deadpan\\" which is freaking hilarious if you have half a sense of humor. Clooney and Streep are amazing at this.... The kids are entertaining, funny and dark. Both of my children -2.5 and 5.5- watched this at least 5 times the first weekend we got it. The stop action is just as classic and rough as it should be - little nuances in the fur, the choppiness - perfect. this is art and if people don't like it, well, their loss. Their opinions speak for their understanding of this art form.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|This is pure fiction...I understand that. If you ever wondered what it would be like to go back to 1914-1918 - knowing what we know today...then this book is for you. If you want any kind of probable idea of what the life and times of people were in that era - you won't get it here. A welsh servant wouldn't likely become a newspaper editor in those times...but here we have nothing but strong willed women doing what they want. The tragedy of this era was that they weren't allowed to...the ones we know about were so rare we actually remember them. As violent and horrible as living under the tzars of Russia were it was only equaled by the bloody violent Bolshiveks...ask anyone who lived thru it....likewise with the corrupt and violent unions. So history, even in a novel has been violated and reframed by the mighty left ! I guess that's how one gets published today...but don't confuse any of this with the real history of the era - It represents half the story and well seasoned with today's PC crap. Complete with wealthy educated white men who are all just so stupid and ego maniacs. We cam laugh today at the lunacy of the attitudes of Empire but if we want to truly understand what the people were like we need to remember,unlike This book, That they felt they were doing morally good as wrong as they may have been...they felt it as strong as we do about global environment efforts today...they truly believed they were helping the world. Writing a novel with the advantage of knowing how wrong  they were then, doesn't portrait the era...What a waste of time and money this was for me, and ashamed after the brilliant job Pillars of the earth was. This is like reading old Russian history books from the soviet era...Lenin would grant this book a peoples award Im sure

The title \\"Write about love\\" says it all really, there is also a young woman looking longingly out of a window while doing just that. The music as always is the typical poppy indie fare, like a pop version of stereolab. The music is really wonderful and even Norah Jones sings on one song. While one can never really say that they \\"rock out\\" it is a wonderful reminder of what indie music used to be.

B000VDDWDS|5.0|Bottom Line: In the final analysis, as the credit rolled I felt cheated; I wanted more or this suburb movie about naval action in the 19th century.<br /><br />Master and Commander opens with the following caption: April 1805 Napoleon is master of Europe. Only the British Fleet stands before him. Oceans are now battlefields.<br /><br />Directed by Peter Weir with screenplay by Weir and John Collee, Master and Commander is based on two novels by Patrick O'Brian, part of a twenty-book series of Royal Navy Captain \\"Lucky\\" Jack Aubrey's adventures spanning the later 18th - early 19th centuries.<br /><br />This particular installment followed Captain Aubrey, superbly portrayed by Russell Crowe as he captains the 24 gun 6th Rate frigate HMS Surprise.  Aubrey's orders are to intercept French 4th Rate 44-gun Frigate Acheron currently en-route to the Pacific Ocean with the intention of making war in those waters off the coast of Brazil.  Aubrey is to either sink, burn, or take the French warship as a prize.<br /><br />In the first five minutes of the movie however the larger, faster, more heavily armed Acheron draws first blood, when materializing out of a fog bank she delivers a devastating broadside to the HMS Surprise, damaging the ships bowstrip, mainmast, and rudder, severely crippling the ship.  If it weren't for the same prevailing fog, the quick thinking of Aubrey and able rowers, the HMS Surprise would have surely been lost and well, the movie ended.<br /><br />Against all opposition Aubrey decides not to sail home for a refit of his shattered vessel, but to effect repairs at sea in a quite little inlet off the Brazilian coast.  Repairs completed the game of cat-and-mouse is taken up again as the HMS Surprise chases the Acheron around Cape Horn into the Great South Sea (Pacific), where she looses her mizzen topmast and a well liked seaman.<br /><br />The chase final ends at the Galapagos Islands (of all places) where British whalers are currently plying their trade, creating the perfect backdrop for the Acheron  to do her worst, and for the climatic battle scene to take place.<br /><br />My Thoughts<br /><br />As it unwinds, mostly onboard the HMS Surprise, the plot evolves into an extended game of cat-and-mouse: encounters with the aptly named Acheron as the \\"phantom ship\\" are in juxtaposition with prolonged glimpses into life onboard a 19th century Royal Navy Frigate.  We are treated to little interaction with the French crew, save through spyglass.  Most of the human interplay is reserved for Aubrey and his mixed crew of seasoned naval veterans, conscripts involuntarily impressed into service, young midshipmen, and powderboy's who are far too young to see battle.<br /><br />Weir's concentration on the HMS Surprise and her crew brings home a realism seldom seen in Hollywood productions; indeed the battle scenes between the HMS Surprise and the Acheron  seem cursory to the telling of the lives of men too harshly lived.  And Weir's passion for detail is evident in every frame as he brings to life O'Brian's rich historical details -- the sailors' routine, the pettiness and superstitions, the grim realities of 19th-century navies, the realistic battle scenes, the blood, and horror, and heroism, the honor and devotion to duty and country, are all portrayed in a stark often macabre reality.<br /><br />The cast is rich, varied, and too numerous to list in narrative, but the relationship between Aubrey and his old friend, and ships doctor, Stephen Maturin, portrayed by Paul Bettany is well worth exploring and receives the most attention throughout the movie.  Maturim is Aubrey's alter ego, his rational voice, and his musical partner.  It is through their music that we are treated to the two men's attempt to bring civility to an otherwise uncivilized pursuit.<br /><br />But Maturin is Aubrey's intellectual equal (Aubrey's military mind and almost mindless devotion to duty is offset by Maturin's humanity, conscience and scientific curiosity).  They are both endowed with a similar sense of honor, and know each other well enough--although we are not told from where their relationship sprang--to playfully, and oft-times earnestly challenge their respective positions, though Aubrey has to obvious upper hand; as captain the final word is his.  Their friendship was made warm and believable by their obvious onscreen chemistry; the closeness they shared while locked in a battle of wills made me wish for the same kind of uncompromising male friendship in my life.  Watching their verbal spars in the officer's mess and their infrequent musical duets together (Aubrey play the violin and Maturin plays the Cello) was for me clearly one of Master and Commander's greatest pleasures.<br /><br />Though through necessity there is \\"nautical\\" speech peppered throughout Master and Commander, it is only used to lend realism to the story, and contemporary speech is used otherwise. The use of contemporary chatter is designed to keep the less nautical engaged in the movie drawing them deeper into the action, allowing them to care, and enveloping the story in a cloak of humanity as the HMS Surprise pursues the Acheron  across two oceans.<br /><br />In the final analysis, as the credit rolled I felt cheated; I wanted more; the movie ended just as the Aubrey and Maturin were once again engaged in play, and the ship was clearing the decks for action, once more in pursuit of the Acheron after Aubrey learns a prickly bit of information. This is testimony to the movies draw, it has everything one would expect from a high-seas adventure movie set in the 19th century--exhilarating battles, menacing weather conditions, honor, bravery, devotion to duty, treachery, superstition, God, and a wonderfully cast of characters that brings life onboard the HMS Surprise to a point where you can virtually taste and smell the salt laden sea spray on your lips and feel the fresh sea air on your skin.d know each other well enough--although we are not told from where their relationship sprang--to playfully, and oft-times earnestly challenge their respective positions, though Aubrey has to obvious upper hand; as captain the final word is his.

0470876417|1.0|It may be an excellent book.    I'll never know. The designer, consumed by a desire to create funky or cutting-edge visuals, lost sight of the first and only requirement of book or magazine design: make it easily readable.    The type is 8 point, my god. The first thing a graphic designer is taught in design school is the relationships between type size, leading and line length. Whoever designed this book must have been out sick on those days.    Good design makes text more, not less, readable. It's the text, stupid.     I'm shocked that the author would have been bamboozled by a designer who made the text almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass.    As Humpty Dumpty said to Alice: \\"The question is,\\" said Humpty Dumpty, \\"which is to be master.  That's all.\\"    It's painfully obvious here that the master was not the author.    It may be a great book, but I'm not going to sit with a magnifying glass in one hand trying to read it.
B000LAZDQA|4.0|Bottom-Line: Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?<br /><br />It's a sad testimony to American cinema that the vast majority of (Hollywood produced) movies come and go without much in the memory to mark their passing.  In their effort to appeal to a mass world-wide audience the denizens of the America's entertainment empire have taken to producing (mostly) movies without much heart, soul, or message.  Thankfully independent film producers and distributors (in this case Think Films) have stepped in and are beginning to release films that bring edge, promise, and meaning back to American cinema.  Such a movie is the (NC-17, sexually explicit ) Shortbus (2006), a biting, edgy, sex laden amusing romp set in contemporary New York City, written and directed by John Cameron Mitchell (Hedwig and the Angry Inch).<br /><br />Variety Magazine called Shortbus \\"The most sexually graphic American narrative feature ever made outside the realm of the porn industry.\\" And make no mistake Shortbus is sexually graphic with depictions of real oral/vaginal sex, and masturbation.  Both heterosexual and homosexual are given equal time here folks so keep the kiddies far away from this movie.<br /><br />But despite the graphic nature of the sex in Shortbus, the film turns out to be a rather funny yet engaging film about sex, relationships, and people enjoying or trying to enjoy sex.  The sex is just a by-product of the relationships the individuals form over the course of the film; dare I say it flows naturally, it does not pretend to be, it just is.<br />You know what you are in for from the opening frames of the film when James (Paul Dawson) is videotaping himself in the bathtub and playing with his penis (yes it is shown, there is full frontal nudity here folks) and then engages in a limber display of self-stimulation complete with (filmed) climax.  His home video at first seems narcissistic and even pornographic, but as the film progresses we get to know James for the deeply sad person he is and the reason for the film.  James is dad even as his (monogamous) partner of five years Jamie (P.J. DeBoy), is decidedly chipper and upbeat; i.e. his emotional polar opposite.  Jamie is almost frenzied, extroverted and just wants to love everybody, and want everybody to love him.<br /><br />Sensing something is wrong with James and their relationship, Jamie suggests that they experiment sexually with other people and this leads to a rather comical group sex (orgy) scene at a local apartment; the gathering is referred to as a Shortbus. Their search for answers also leads them to a sex therapist (who prefers to be called a couples therapist) named Sofia (Sook-Yin Lee).  During the opening sequence of the movie she is seen having wild engaging in (un-simulated) wild sex with her husband Rob (Raphael Barker) in every room in their apartment and trying positions straight from the Kama Sutra how-to manual.  But we soon learn that Sophia is pre-orgasmic (her term) meaning she has never had an orgasm--even through self stimulation and has been faking them for years in order to spare her husband ego.  So that the fact that she's a sex therapist proves to be one of the most deliciously ironic sub-plots of the movie, as she tries again and again to achieve one.<br /><br />And then there is Severin (Lindsay Beamish) a dominatrix who is so closed off that she forbids anyone to touch her, though she surrounds herself with Polaroid's she takes of random people.  But she is lonely and longs for a normal life with a house, white picket fence, little ones, and vaginal orgasms.  And there is Ceth (Jay Brannan) who becomes the (brief) third in James and Jamie's relationship. Finally, there is a very flamboyant Justin Bond who runs Shortbus and a Caleb (Peter Stickles) a voyeuristic young man who has been watching James and Jamie from his apartmentacross the street.<br /><br />The cast of Shortbus is composed of mostly unknowns and newcomers; it's hard to image any Hollywood \\"A\\" listed actor/actress going as far as the characters did in the movie for the sake of their art-form (though Chloe Sevigny did her part in 2003's Brown Bunny).  But the lack of star presence lent a nice layer of realism to the film it might otherwise have lacked.<br /><br />The most poignant and challenging performances in Shortbus belong to Paul Dawson and Sook-Yin Lee, though the movie must have been challenging for all involved give the nature of the film.  And yet after I finished watching Shortbus it was not so much the explicit sex that stayed with me--though it left its mark--it was the deeper meaning of the film; trying to puzzle out the reasons for the various characters sexual hang-up's and other emotional trauma's.  Why did Sofia's orgasm continue to elude her; why is James so profoundly sad, so much so that he plans to take his own life; why is Severin so closed off?<br /><br />In the end what makes Shortbus such an eye-opening American film is not the explicit sex contained therein, but that the movie is not afraid to explore it in such a grown up manner; it does not titillate, nor does it insult, is shows us sex as it would be if the camera were not there.  To be sure Shortbus is at times physically stimulating, but not as much as it is emotionally and mentally) arousing; and aren't those the two erogenous zones that matter most in sex?<br /><br />Rated NC-17 for graphic sex and language.across the street.<br /><br />The cast of Shortbus is composed of mostly unknowns and newcomers; it's hard to image any Hollywood \\"A\\" listed actor/actress going as far as the characters did in the movie for the sake of their art-form (though Chloe Sevigny did her part in 2003's Brown Bunny).

No contrived love story in the plot - No special effects or computer animation to ruin things - No surprise ending - Nothing except a story of greatness.  Go see it folks - run, don't walk.  If only for the period costumes and impeccable photography, it would be worth seeing.  But to relive the sheer greatness of this powerful, amazing horse is even better.
B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Pros: She can sing and play an instrument; She beautiful and intelligent.<br /><br />Cons: Some misfires<br /><br />Bottom-Line: The Element of Freedom is a worthy successor those works that came before it.<br /><br />Twelve-time Grammy Award winner Alicia Keys, the beautiful, light-skinned, Black-American bombshell diva from Harlem released her forth studio album The Element of Freedom in December 2009 to much funfair some seven years after her smash 10 million selling Songs in A Minor (2001).<br /><br />Upon release, As I Am, like its predecessors won wide-spread critical acclaim and debuted on the charts at No. 1 selling some 742,000 copies in its first week of release making it her strongest debut album yet.  As of January 2008, As I Am had sold some three million copies worldwide; earning a triple-platinum designation, making it less successful than Songs in A Minor, but what's a million albums in sales between Diva and fans?<br /><br />The Element of Freedom debuted at the No. 1 spot on Billboard's R&B Albums and Digital Albums charts as well as No. #2 on Billboard's Top 200 Albums chart. In its first week the album sold some 418,000 copies and spawned the hit singles Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart (track No. 4) and Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down (track No. 14).<br /><br />While this showing is not as good as past efforts, the numbers were enough to give Alicia Keys the biggest first week sales for a female R&B performer in 2009.<br /><br />There is something refreshingly predictable about Alicia Keys' music; it like a comfortable pair of socks, or a set of freshly washed silk sheets.  Her music slides down the musical palate like a rich full-bodied wine, a choice cut of expertly grilled porterhouse steak.  It's a known quantity, but each album brings to the table a contemporary vibe that far from being disjointed fits right in and makes me smile and sing along.<br /><br />For example track No. 10 Put in a Love Song (Featuring Beyonce) lends the piece a certain urban Hip-Hop cache that would appeal to the younger set, but without tarnishing the song for her older fans.<br /><br />Like all of Ms. Keys albums there is strong undercurrent of the relationship in her music, though Alicia has never been linked to anyone romantically--The Diva is reluctant to speak openly about certain elements of her personal life.  Be that as it may, The Element of Freedom is a very good album with just the right amount of mid-tempo beat coupled with a more thoughtful tone that belies her more mature outlook on life.<br /><br />Keys has said of The Element of Freedom that it is about overcoming depression, possibly after a bad break-up that we failed to hear about in the mainstream entertainment press.  This is not hard to believe given the tone and tenor of the CD's track listing; track No. 4 Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart certainly speaks of broken dream, aching hearts, and empty beds.<br /><br />Throughout this engaging CD Alicia Keys never fails to entertain; the CD brings something fresh and engaging to the table with every track; indeed the more I listen the more I like The Element of Freedom.  It's clear that Ms. Keys is singing about the heart-rending process of getting over a recent breakup, but she also lamenting the joy of newly rediscovered independence and a spiritual rediscovery (track No. 6 That's How Strong My Love is) as she says goodbye to the past and looks ahead to the future.<br /><br />If I have one criticism of the CD, it is that Ms. Key's vocals are not as strong as they have been on pat CD's because of over engineering and layering.  On some tracks I found it hard to recognize her (distinctive) voice and that is unfortunate because she uses it to good effect.<br /><br />Nonetheless The Element of Freedom is a worthy successor those works that came before it.  Though some of the lyrics are pedestrian, they nonetheless work in the context of the overall work.

B00005R2M3|2.0|I've been enamored of the Columbian singer-songwriter, musician, record producer, dance, and actress (quite a pedigree) Shakira (Mebarak) for about a month now soaking up everything I can listen to and watch by her; I'm going through a phase.  That includes her first U.S. release, 2001's Laundry Service, which I recently bought from Amazon.com and that has sold some 15 million copies worldwide.  The chart-topping multi-platinum CD features the singles Objection (Tango), Underneath Your Clothes, and Whenever, Wherever.<br /><br />While the aforementioned tracks go a long way to showcasing Shakira's musical and cultural heritage, they also point to the inherent weakness in her musical pedigree and that is her weak and somewhat unique vocals.  Shakira's voice is certainly not one we have heard before.  It would be a stretch to call it beautiful, or lyrical, or captivating; it is more grating than anything else, at least when Shakira sings in English.  When she is singing in Spanish her voice does not grate nearly as much.<br /><br />Track No. 2 Underneath Your Clothes is a perfect case in point.  It is usually during ballets that any musical artists' vocal acumen really shines.  The quiet passage sans of bass and heavy over-production usually lends itself to beautiful and soulful vocal rendering that make the soul swoon.  Not so on this track; Underneath Your Clothes shouts in undeniable tones that Shakira's voice is, well, unpolished, unschooled, and not all that pleasant to listen to.<br /><br />Musically Laundry Service--which Shakira takes sole production credit for--is a diverse serving of hip-moving popular music melded with Latin textures that follow close on the heels of Shakira's Spanish-language offerings.  And so the CD is hard to pigeonhole, or get a musical read on.<br /><br />If you are a fan or world music Laundry Service will probably be up your musical alley.  As it stands I do not like most of the CD because I can only take Shakira's voice is small doses, and because most of the tracks did not click with me, because lyrically they make little sense and some are just downright silly.  Track No. 5, The One and track No. 9 Poem to a Horse are examples of a songs that made little lyrical sense to me.  Perhaps I didn't look deep enough for the meaning(?).<br /><br />Shakira's real draw, for me at least, is her musical videos in which her seemingly boundless energy plays across the screen is eclectic dance numbers set to the strong percussive backbeat of whatever single she is prancing about to.  Track No. 3, Whenever, Wherever the first release from Laundry Service is a good example.<br /><br />Now I don't want to leave the impression that I didn't find something to like in Laundry Service.  Track No. 1 Obsession (Tango) and its Spanish language counterpart Track No. 13 Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango) as well as Track No.3 Whenever, Wherever, and it Spanish-language counterpart, track No. 12 Suerta (Whenever, Wherever) were all enjoyable, and to a lesser extent Underneath Your Clothes.<br /><br />However, outside of those tracks I found little to like in Laundry Service, and I wanted to like the CD based on the strength of the aforementioned tracks, but the other tracks failed to click with me.most of the tracks did not click with me, because lyrically they make little sense and some are just downright silly.

I only find a movie that I want to see over and over once every few years and this is truly one of them. I'm pretty sure this is the first time I have even commented on a movie!

B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read a lot of reviews of ROOM prior to purchasing the Kindle version (over the normal $9.99 price).  I don't normally opt for a Kindle price over $9.99, but felt this was totally worth it.    At first I felt the kid's voice was annoying and not very real - that's the 4 year old recently turned 5 narrator Jack - then once I got into his rhythm and how he spoke, it clicked.  Jack's view of the world is skewed - and so is his language.    How the author kept the suspense and pace in Room (the place, not the title of the book) is extremely impressive.  What happens outside of Room (again the place in the story) will make you wonder how we all adapt as humans to external stimuli.    If anyone can recommend other books by this author, please let me know!  Next to \\"The Help\\" - it was one of the most amazing reads that I've had in a long time.    Totally recommend this read - in any format you can find it!
B001UV4XHY|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />Book 7 was not my favorite book, mostly because I feel like Rowling just killed people off for the sake of killing them off, and she really should have let SOME of my favorite characters live through it.<br /><br />That being said, part one was pretty true to the book (as others have stated), so most of my complaints about it are the same ones I had about the book (too slow, Ron being whiny, too many pointless deaths, etc).  I really did not enjoy the dance scene between Harry and Hermione.  I felt uncomfortably like a peeping tom while watching it (I don't go to movies to feel uncomfortable), and I don't like that they tried to create \\"tension\\" between Harry and Hermione.  They are just friends, and I don't know why they decided to spend 30 seconds flirting with the idea of 'more'.<br /><br />I really did not think that they gave Hedwig's death enough time or showed very well how upsetting it was to Harry.  When Dobby died, I could not understand why someone didn't try to help him.  They just sat there looking sad at him.  Harry has been injured badly several times, and they always manage to heal him back up...but Dobby isn't worth it?<br /><br />It really was too long.  I hate how all 'serious' movies seem like they are required to be over 2 hours long anymore.  This one, with a lot of material, could be justifiably long, but if I find myself sitting in the theatre hoping for it to end, then in my opinion the story or the director has at least partially failed.  I enjoyed the movie, but I still felt I was in that theatre for about 4 hours, and the last 30 minutes of the film every time the screen went dark I prayed that it was over.  I know that sounds conflicted, but its how I felt about it.<br /><br />I also hate the \\"shaky camera\\" fad in movies over the last decade.  This one wasn't too bad about it, but it felt like all of the non-action scenes were filmed with a little flip camera by a high school student.

1439107955|5.0|Siddhartha Mukherjee's monumental \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" meticulously outlines the trajectory of cancer (derived from the Greek word \\"karkinos,\\" meaning crab) over thousands of years, starting in ancient Egypt.  In 2010, seven million people around the world will die of cancer.  Many have experienced the horrors of this disease through personal experience.  The author provides us with a global view of this \\"shape-shifting entity [that is] imbued with such metaphorical and political potency that it is often described as the definitive plague of our generation.\\"<br /><br />In \\"The Emperor of All Maladies,\\" we meet a variety of patients, doctors, scientists, and activists.  We also hear the voices of such iconic figures as Susan Sontag, author of \\"Illness as Metaphor,\\" and Alexander Solzhenitsyn, whose \\"Cancer Ward\\" is a desolate and isolating \\"medical gulag.\\"  Cancer is such a complex subject that it can only be understood by examining it in all of its facets:  through myths, the anguish of its victims, and the untiring efforts of its adversaries, both past and present, some of whom were well-meaning but horribly misguided. Mukherjee says in his author's note that he has made an effort to be \\"simple but not simplistic.\\"  In this he has succeeded.<br /><br />Ancient physicians thought that such invisible forces as \\"miasmas\\" and \\"bad humors\\" caused cancers.  Many years of experimentation, studies of human anatomy, laboratory work, and clinical trials have shown cancer to be a \\"pathology of excess\\" that originates from the uncontrolled growth of a single cell.  Cancer is \\"unleashed by mutations--changes in DNA that specifically affect genes that incite unlimited cell growth.\\"  What treatment to use--surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, or a combination of these approaches--is rarely an easy decision.  Equally significant are the efforts of public health officials, who seek to reduce cancer's mortality through early detection (mammography and colonoscopy, among others, are screening methods in use today). In addition, cancer may be prevented by encouraging people to avoid environmental carcinogens such as cigarette smoke.<br /><br />This elegant and heartrending narrative is far more than a biography of a terrible malady.  It is also a story of paternalism, arrogance, and false hope,  as well as inventiveness, determination, and inspiration. We meet Sidney Farber, who pioneered a chemotherapeutic approach to leukemia in children during the 1940's and helped launch \\"the Jimmy Fund\\"; William Halstead who, in the nineteenth century, disfigured women with radical mastectomies that, in many cases, were not curative; Paul Ehrlich, who discovered a \\"magic bullet\\" to combat syphilis from a derivative of chemical dyes; Mary Lasker, a powerful businesswoman and socialite who zealously raised money and political awareness in what would become a national war on cancer; and George Papanicolaou, a Greek cytologist, whose Pap smear \\"changed the spectrum of cervical cancer.\\"  Mukherjee constantly moves back and forth in time, showing how the past and the present are closely interconnected.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Dr. Mukherjee's keeps returning to one of his patients, Carla.  In 2004, she was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, a cancer of the white blood cells.  She would have a long road ahead of her, filled with pain, fear, and uncertainty. We look to the future with cautious optimism that even greater progress will be made in our never-ending battle against a treacherous and multi-pronged enemy.  Mukherjee is a brilliant oncologist, gifted writer, scrupulous researcher, and spellbinding storyteller.  \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is a riveting, thought-provoking, and enlightening work that deserves to become an instant classic.methods in use today).

1439133948|5.0|I totally enjoyed this sci-fi masterpiece. The humanity was there like in the Best of Madame Bujold's literary successes. This story was people oriented, but the science supported the story, it was not THE story...the best kind of sci-fi.    I refuse to give the story away....but the ending made me do something I have not done since I was a toddler...     A hardy and rousing 5 out of 5, without hesitation.  The only book better in the series was 'The Warriors Apprentice\\".
B0034C9CFK|5.0|So glad I picked this up when it came out!  I loved it all the way through, my favorite track though is \\"Tailights Blue\\" and is now also my favorite Jackson song of all time.  I really hope that the release of his 34 Biggest Hits doesn't mean he's done releasing singles from Freight Train.  I really think Tailights would hit #1 if it comes out to radio...if not it must really mean that classic country is dead and gone.  My other favorites are \\"Hard Hat and a Hammer\\" and the title track.  Can't beileve Hard Hat only made it to 17 on the charts.      If you don't have this album, you should pick it up...Alan really is the last real country artist out there.  While radio is dominated by stuff that's really pop cross-overs like Lady A., Taylor, Carrie etc.  Yeah, I know George and Reba are still there...but IMO they've both sold out to the wishy-washy radio friendly stuff a LONG time ago.    Thanks Alan!
0896898288|3.0|I love quilt books with a story and this one has all kinds of interesting letters from a contest held in the 1920's, reprinted in this book. I love reading the letters and like seeing the quilt blocks, some of which I have never seen before. The bad thing about the book is that you HAVE to get the templates off the accompanying cd and there are NO rotary cutter instructions/ measurement. AND, as someone else mentioned, there is one template to a page and who want to waste that much paper printing them off?!<br />So, if you are into the letters from Farmer's wives and want to get an insight into their lives, get the book. If you would like to make the blocks/quilt, find a better source.
B003TML0VO|2.0|Carlos Santana is a guitar god. I am a huge fan of his work and have most of his albums. But this one is just further evidence that he needs to \\"GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING.\\" Right: Get the percussionists back, get some Chicano singers, and crank out some of the stuff like the first album or Abraxas. And YOU, folks? Forget this commercial garbage and get those first 2 Santana albums if you don't have them already. THAT is what you want from Carlos. The Supernatural album was very good, yes, but not as good as those first 2.
0307346617|1.0|Being a child of the 70's I am a fan of horror movies and zombie flicks in particular. Romero is responsible for several AM sheet changings from my room. Now that I am grown and have better bladder control I love zombies. I adore them. I wanted to love this book. To adore it. However, I find it lacking in substance.  The interviews are too short to give a real glimpse into the stories of the outbreak. I found myself forcing myself to continue reading. Not zombies??!! Yep. I couldn't get into it as hard as I tried. I admire the concept, but the product reads choppily. The writing is sophomoric at best. Sorry, but that's truly how I feel about it. Your mileage may vary.
B00007KQA3|5.0|Its a good book and this is the 2nd version movie that I have seen and I enjoyed both versions, both could be longer and include more details. The modern was good and believable stage settings, the older one was good but looked like sets.
B003V4AK8E|1.0|I have been waiting for an XBOX style controller for PS3 since the day I got my PS3. I have a lot of problems with Microsoft and the XBOX, but I must admit that they got the controller design right. All the other XBOX style controllers have gotten horrible reviews. When I saw this one, I though I would take a chance.    Let me start off with the bad first. When I opened the box, I was very upset to find that you have to have a usb dongle connected to the PS3 for this to work wirelessly. It DOES NOT have bluetooth built in. For a $40 3rd party controller, I find this very frustrating. When you first start playing with it, you will notice a \\"deadzone\\" in the analog sticks, at least in the right analog stick, but it appears that this can be fixed (see below). The trigger buttons are by far better than standard PS3 trigger buttons, but at first, I found myself wishing they were more like XBOX trigger buttons. It is also a little annoying that you can't turn on the PS3 with the home button, and that with the usb dongle plugged in, the Pro Elite is automatically selected as player 1.    Now for the good. I find the controller to be quite comfortable, and the textured surface helps to ensure a good grip. After playing for a little while, I find that I actually quite like the trigger buttons. Another big plus, I connected the usb dongle to my PC just for the heck of it, and sure enough, it installs quickly and easily and after calibration, works perfectly. Just to emphasize, you can use this controller as a WIRELESS PC controller right out of the box, without the elaborate procedure you have to go through for a regular PS3 controller. I am very happy about that. A wireless xbox controller requires that you buy $20 wireless receiver, which kind of defeats the purpose of a wireless controller.    *IMPORTANT* It appears that the deadzone issue can be fixed by properly syncing the controller. Follow the instructions in the manual. Press the sync button on the dongle, then the home button on the controller. When the home button is solid blue, you have synced properly and you shouldn't experience the deadzone problem. You may have to restart the system, or sync before you load whatever game you are playing, but it does appear to solve the deadzone issue.    Summary: A good (not perfect) XBOX style controller for PS3 which also works for PC. Definitely worth $40. Lack of bluetooth support and required dongle are major annoyances, but until a better option comes out, this is probably your best bet for an XBOX style controller on both PC and PS3.    **UPDATE** It turns out that syncing did not fix the problem (at least not permanently). I recently returned the controller and exchanged it for the similar NYKO Raven. It has the exact same problem. I noticed that they even have similar deadzones. It appears that the deadzone moves around a bit. Sometimes it is even on all sides, other times it is only on the bottom and right sides of the stick. Both controllers have this problem. When I connected the Pro Elite to my PC, it had the same deadzone. As I said before, calibrating the controller fixed the problem.     The deadzone problem appears to be widespread (if not universal). I've read about it in just about every review I have seen of both this controller, and the Raven. The deadzones on these 3rd party controllers do not appear to be built-in to the controller. At least, the deadzones do register input, just not with whatever the default calibration is. I suspect that this is probably an issue related to a firmware update. I can't imagine that these manufacturers would begin production on these controllers with such a serious issue. They probably were tested on an earlier version of the PS3 firmware and worked just fine. I am a bit suspicious because neither NYKO nor Power A mention these problems or suggest any fixes anywhere. For such a major issue, you would think they would say something somewhere. I emailed Power A about the issue maybe aweek ago and haven't heard back (not even a automated reply) which makes me think they aren't going to respond. There is also nothing on Sony's website. Makes me wonder if this is something Sony could fix, but doesn't want to.
B003NFM3JU|3.0|I suppose that everyone looks for different things in movies... This has to be one of the worst diologue audio mixes that i have tried to listen to in recent years!!!  Yes you can turn the audio up to try to listen to it --- until the next scene blows you out of the room.... This is ultimately annoying... On the other hand most of the movie is acceptable-- But how mutch laughter can you take from christmas present???  3 stars...
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The Movie    It is quite telling when the machines and guns in a movie have more detail than the characters operating them.    Bad acting, thoughtless dialog, 3D that is interesting for no more than 5 minutes and a plot straight out of Pocahontas didn't win me over in the theater.  \\"Unobtanium\\" anyone?  I found Avatar to be a B movie in every sense.  You can tell Cameron learned to make movies from Roger Corman, because Avatar shows every cliche this side of Deathsport.  I did like the speed of which the narrative moves - despite it's length, there is a brisk pace to the plot.  And even in its long form here, I actually enjoyed the early scenes of Jake on Earth in this new extended edit.  Why?  There were more people and less computer generated blue Jar Jar Binks clones running around doing things I know aren't real.      Computers have done great things for movies, but give me a muppet or a real person every time. I know when its fake and it takes me out of the movie.  The characters in the movie have little to no depth.  We know the good guys, we know the bad guys and Jake is caught in the middle.  This is great for kids, but at 30 years-old, I need something more conflicting than the one-dimensional, recycled, apologetic groveling Cameron shovels out here.  Despite my recrimination, I'm obviously in the minority.  You have to hand it to Cameron for connecting with his audience.  The box office take speaks for itself.    In the end, Avatar is an experience that succeeds because of noise, machines and guns - everything the narrative supposedly stands against.  Sure it has a \\"green message\\" but this is still basically a movie with a bunch of Marines running around shooting aliens and robots.  In that sense,  James Cameron hasn't come all that far since Terminator.  There's no reason why that is not a compliment.        The Blu-Ray    Well since this one was shot digitally, it looks fantastic and sounds just as good through my surround system.  I know it was shot and\\"animated\\" for 3D, but I HATED the 3D in theaters and I tend to enjoy the film much more in standard 2D.  I'll say it - every 3D movie I have ever seen is a gimmicky piece of crap.  Avatar had a soft image in 3D with no shortage of ghosting.  But in little old 2D, it looks and sounds amazing.  The sound design alone is good reason to pop this one in for friends on a Saturday night and crank up the sound.  Worth the purchase.      The Movie:   2.5/5  The Blu-Ray:  5/5
B00260HH3K|3.0|For one, I got this movie for $1 in a bargain bin in a local store, I figured if its bad..it doesnt matter. I paid almost nothing for it. Now the movie was ok at best, with some good action but its what you would expect when an American movie company tries to make a movie based on an anime from Japan. Nothing really that special. It had its moments..mainly bad...but enjoyable.
B003EYVXTG|4.0|This is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen and it isn't even a horror movie. It's set in Missouri near the Ozarks and it deals with a teenaged girl who has to track down her dad. He's due in court on drug charges. He used their house as collateral on his bond. If he doesn't show, sis, her younger brother and sister and vegetablized mom are out on the street (or in the woods as it applies here). So she sets out to find his old haunts, friends and family (very little difference there) so she can track him down.    This is a powerful film. And it's lean. No fancy sets or special effects. It's all writing and acting. Jennifer Lawrence plays the lead. She's a nice girl, but she's street smart, tough and nobody's fool. She confronts all manner of people unflinchingly to get the answers she needs. John Hawkes is one of her dad's cousins who knows the kind of trouble she's getting into but helps anyway. Garrett Dillahunt plays the local cop who really screws things up. These are just a few of a really fine cast that infuse nearly every scene with a sense of menace.    They bring the \\"everyone's related, trailer trash\\" thing to the fore and do not even attempt to make it politically correct. These are dirty, nasty, drug making, drug selling, drug using, mean spirited people who are no strangers to death and killing. Most of the people she talks to are related to her to some degree or another but would kill her if they had to.     Most of it takes place outdoors, during the winter, or in these nasty shacks. That alone puts the viewer on edge. Add to that all the other assorted foulness and this becomes a very scary movie.     I love these kinds of movies because they remind me of how much can be done in film with so very little. The right script, actors and director and you have a gem like this. Try putting this on next Halloween instead of your favorite horror movie and see how well you sleep that night.
192076920X|5.0|This is the most impressive book I ever read.  I even watched all youtube video about it, read some web site about it and I just like it even more.  I am just eager to read the next one.
0792164903|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is one of the scariest versions of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow story which was written by Washington Irving. This gripping tale begins with a shocking scene within the first 5 minutes! Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are great.
0061997811|5.0|This is a detailed, wonderful, fantastic book. The effort that went into this is incredible, and the result is awesome. I'm surprised i could get it for this cheap.
0802798225|4.0|This book was quite a cliche, but I couldn't stop myself from wanting more. To me, cliches are still passionate love stories. This story had me feeling everything the characters did. Both had interesting quirks and thoughts that I never saw coming.     I'm excited for the spin-off, \\"Rules of Attraction\\" featuring Carlos, Alex's little brother. It seems like a cliche, again, but they never get old. I also found it interesting how the sequel is, in fact, a spin-off. Lately, it hasn't seemed to happen that way, but I like it.     I've been hearing lately that this book has been recently compared to Twilight. What a crazy thought on anyone's part. Elkeles's writing is much different that Meyer's, though not necessarily superior. In my opinion, both books were fantastic in their own ways and there's no sense trying to compare two completely different things. Simone Elkeles never lets me down, and I don't presume she will.
B003ZK58WM|3.0|... I thought there was a LOT that could have been left out of the book.  It's almost like this was purposely written to be very long and drawn out.  It included a lot of boring detail that I found myself wanting to just brush over. Having said that I will say I enjoyed the storyline and thought it was interesting to read about the WWI era.  Another review I read said the history wasn't accurate but I think it should be recognized that this was intended to be fictional.  I found it worthwhile to get pieces of historic events that I either didn't know about or had forgotten learning about back in school.  It might not be completely accurate but I think Ken Follett stayed true to history and provided a true flavor of what life was life then.  He definitely has a knack for making you see/feel the period of time and connect with the characters, much like he did with \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".  I especially found it interesting to read about the war from the point of view of characters with opposite political views and how they all seem to come together one way or another.  It makes you realize that we are all just people with common interests, goals and desires regardless of where your politics fall.
0446567337|3.0|I love all of Nicholas Sparks's books, but this one was a little different for me. Although I found the idea of the book inspiring, and the movie looks flawless, I found myself skipping significant parts of the book. Others found this book very emotional, and I simply did not. I liked the twist, though. The typical love story always involves a happy ending, and although the ending may not spark happiness immediately. I felt a sense of accomplishment, almost. Like John and Savannah have learned to accept their differences and are able to successfully move on with their lives without losing each other all together.
0143118420|4.0|Basically entertaining and spiritually helpful.  A good read, but a bit slow in the beginning, then picked up halfway through the first segment.  What could have been a very boring story is rescued by Gilbert's amusing way of looking at life.  I recommend this book to those with open hearts and a willingness to go on this personal journey with the author. Let her story unfold and bring into your own life the discovery of a fresh way of being.
0671027344|4.0|Even though this book is considered a classic, I often found myself wanting more than it offered. Some parts I found inspiring, others I found almost irrelevant. It was a fairly good book, but even though I just finished it last night, I can't remember the ending. It obviously did not have a great impact on me, but I do remember some quotes that I don't think I will ever forget.
B00062IDCO|4.0|I own this season and I love it, but there are a few storylines I don't like. I had been waiting for a wedding ceremony for Tom and B'Elanna from the start. I was cheated out of seeing them get married in a ceremony. No, \\"Course Oblivion\\" doesn't count because it wasn't the real Tom and B'Elanna. I didn't like some of the aspects of the \\"Endgame\\". At the reunion it seemed as if \\"Harry\\" and the \\"Doctor\\" wrote it. It was all from their fantasies. C'mon now, no flesh and blood woman ia going to marry a hologram. Tom who did the most to get them home was portrayed as a clown. The writers should have shown him some respect. He was Chief Pilot, Chief Medic,  He designed the Delta flyer, He put his life in danger in so many instances to save the crew. From the beginning when he saved Chakotay's life by getting him off that rickety staircase just before it dropped into an endless pit. He went undercover with the Kazon, He got the ship back after it was taken by the Kazon and saved the crew from having to spend the rest of their lives on that baren volcanic planet by flying through weapons fire. He broke the warp barrier. He trained with the Doctor even though he hated it for the sake of the crew. As far as I'm concerned Tom Paris was Voyager's hero. What did Harry do to compare? Nothing. Harry was Captain Janeway's pet from the beginning. She gave him priveleges  he didn't earn. She started training Harry to take her place as Captain even though he wasn't captain material. In \\"Nightingale\\" he got involved with aliens and snuck them back to Voyager without asking the real Captain's permission. Harry involved himself and the crew in a conflict between warring species, he risked bringing Voyager into that war. He risked wiping out the crew with an alien disease because of his hormones  in \\"The Disease\\" and all he got was a slap on the wrist. He wasn't punished in any way because he was the Captain's pet. On the other hand Tom who was trying to saved a \\"planet\\" from destructionwas too severely punished. It should have been one or the other, either demoted or brig, not both.  For risking wiping out the crew Harry diserved both, but got neither. I believe Seven had more to do with designing Astrometrics than Harry. C'Mon, Seven had technologies from who knows how many different alien worlds. Tom is the one who should have been shown in a great light in \\"Endgame\\", not Harry. At the end I would have liked to have seen the Paris family: Tom, B'Elanna, and baby together, not B'Elanna, baby, and the Doctor. Oh, and speaking of the baby, who in their right mind is going to make a hologram a godfather to a flesh and blood baby. B'Elanna only did that because she felt guilty for reprogramming him. She refused men godfathership because she claimed they weren't qualified, but the Doctor wasn't any more qualified. I only hope they changed that once they got back. Oh, and by the way. I have a theory of what that waterworld planet was. I think it was meant to house that creature. I think it was like a huge aquarium. That creature might of meant a lot to the species who built it and wanted to give it a proper home.
1846144132|5.0|One of the joys of being resident in the UK is the presence of the wonderful BBC Radio 4 a channel with which listeners have a true lifelong love affair. To Dear American chums a quick scan across the internet to the BBC \\"i\\" player will find this rich source and life will be all the better for it. Radio 4 challenges, it provokes and gets as near to that much sought after but rarely achieved quality \\"the heart of the matter\\" as is humanly possible (the probing questions of presenters on the Today programme makes me think that democracy still has a fighting chance). The channel also carries many brilliant series of which \\"A History of the World in 100 Objects\\" by Neil MacGregor is a prime example, even the trailers leading up to its broadcast in January this year were great. What a pleasure therefore to have copy in the written word of this weighty book (738 pages) to accompany the series and to revisit the passion and authority of Neil MacGregor, director of the British Museum and cultivator of fabulous facts.<br /><br />The whole premise underpinning this epic journey was predicated on a wicked idea conceived by Mark Damazer, then head of Radio 4 to challenge our hugely knowledgeable bods at the British Museum to undertake a somewhat mischievous and loaded exercise. Indeed on the surface any attempt to tell a rather large tale like the history of the world over a modest 2 million years in this manner seems like a piece of First Class honours inspired lunacy. \\"Baby and bathwater\\" is the phrase that comes to mind and even if the radio series and the following book were outright bilge you would at least have to give Neil MacGregor three stars for accepting the challenge and embracing with gusto the humongous concept. Yet he succeeds triumphantly and as the BBC blurb states he sets out in copious detail the sheer importance of \\"A chipped stone that was one of the first things ever made by human hands; a clay tablet telling the story of the great flood centuries before the Bible; a broken hunter's spear dropped by one of the earliest settlers in America; a hoard of gold abandoned in the Wars of the Roses ... every object tells a story\\" The use of this quote shows just how bloody difficult it is to summarize the sheer diversity of the subject matter and scale of the challenge that the author faced. I frankly remain in awe of his herculean task not least of all for his chapter on the English pepper pot dating from 350 BC which should be required reading for every child of school age. Most of all he understands the true value of encyclopaedic knowledge, in short the ability to illuminate through a fine selection of the facts while at the same time employing the skills of the story teller and then re-connecting his narratives with the present.<br /><br />Certainly it is true that the hugely hyped and momentous unveiling of THE one object that defines the modern age was somewhat of a disappointment (I will not spoil it - read the book). That said you suspect that MacGregor probably faced the same horrific challenge as Douglas Adams encountered in \\"The Hitch-hikers guide to the galaxy\\" coming up with something simple but clever enough to answer the Ultimate Question. Anyway give him a break since he was probably in need of a rest by this time.<br /><br />To his eternal credit it is understood that as a result of the radio series and now this book, citizens of our curious nation have been flocking to Bloomsbury to seek out the hereto unknown treasures/pleasures of the British Museum and examine for themselves the Mexican ceremonial ballgame belt (AD100-500) and yes the good old pepperpot. Satisfying the other key factor of the whole exercise is that some of more obvious choices that he could have gone for are ignored at the expense of the more quirky but equally illustrative. This then is a wonderful book, full of lavish illustrations and crystal clear maps. And yes I know that times are hard and deep cuts stalk the land but \\"A History ofthe World in 100 Objects\\" by Neil MacGregor is a fairly priced volume full of unparalleled treasure and should be included on all lists heading up the chimney to Santa in the next few months.ects\\" by Neil MacGregor is a fairly priced volume full of unparalleled treasure and should be included on all lists heading up the chimney to Santa in the next few months.
B000002J29|5.0|I'll make this short and sweet.  I listened to Disc 1 of this CD tonight and now I need to review this.    Albeit being a Genesis fan since '75, I am biased.  They are the best band ever, period, especially in this period.  No knock against Gabriel, but to deliver their Gabriel era music mixed in with their post Gabriel selections via Trick of the Tail and Wind and Wuthering is prime turf indeed.  This is where the music shines without the Gabriel costumes and antics.  I know, I know, its an album, but you can see some of this concert footage on You Tube, and what delivers is the music.  Imagine actually seeing the musicians play their instruments without seeing what Gabriel is wearing or doing.  I brag to anyone who will listen that this is the best live album ever, (bias showing once again).  I just listened to disc one again tonight with my earbuds on through my MP3 player.  Gone are the days of the tower speakers and 150 watts per channel annoying half a city block.  However, if this album was played through a decent system the nuances of the songs jump out at you.  Rutherfords' bass pedals, Hacketts' fingers sliding across the strings (Robbery Assault and Battery) the subtlety of Banks' keyboards in contrast with Collins' plea of \\"touch me, touch me, why don't you touch me,touch me now, now, now... on The Musical Box.    Not only was this the greatest era of rock, but this was the best live album to convey what was possible when talent and technology melded together. Whether you are a fan of Genesis or not, this is a must have.

0330458507|4.0|The greatest strength of David Halberstam's book The Coldest Winter is that it offers a comprehensive political history of the Korean War.  The calculations made by Harry Truman, Douglas MacArthur, Mao Zedong, Kim Sung-Il, Joseph Stalin and many other political, military, and civilian actors to precipitate the war in its terrible early days and subsequently sustain the war for an additional two years of bloody stalemate are the focus of this book.  Although he provides very clear and vivid descriptions of the individual heroism of enlisted men and officers during the major battles of the war, Halberstam uses such coverage to illustrate the human costs of war--a war ultimately led by men seeking to achieve political objectives amidst post-World War II uncertainty.  Readers expecting a detailed military history of the whole war, particularly during the stalemate, will likely be disappointed.  Those who want to understand the political context and strategy behind the brilliant victories and defeats, however, will be satisfied.    The book's greatest weakness, however, is that Halberstam's political biases sometimes manifest itself in obvious and distracting ways.  Although readers could reasonably expect a political history book to reflect some of the author's biases, they should also expect the author to mitigate them with strong evidence to back up his claims.  One major example where Halberstam fails to meet this standard is in his sheer antipathy for Douglas MacArthur, which goes too far in an early chapter of the book where he, as other reviewers have noted, calls MacArthur a \\"mama's boy\\" (pg. 115, Chapter 8) and then proceeds to write a negative portrait of his mother.  This chapter is even more remarkable since Halberstam spends the previous chapter doing to the same to MacArthur's father.  Although these chapters are intended to provide the reader background into MacArthur's domineering personality, Halberstam marshals plenty of evidence in the book without needing to insult MacArthur's family.  This strong, personal attack on MacArthur so early in the book could easily discourage readers, particularly those who do not share the author's biases.    The Coldest Winter is not the final word on the Korean War.  Yet the book is a critical addition to the study of the war because it clearly illustrates the costs of seeking political gain through military conflict--consequences of which still reverberate to this day.
B003INBNXO|5.0|Ip Man might be the best martial arts film ever, at least as far as its detailed depiction of a particular style and its characterization of an individual master goes. The movie reminded me of the recent Ong Bat with it's hard hitting fight scenes. Combining an engaging story with spectacular fight scenes, the movies tells the story of Ip Man, a famous wing chun master and his family set against the backdrop of the Japanese invasion of WWII.<br /><br />Sammo Hung, the heavy set but amazingly fast and agile Hong Kong and Hollywood veteran actor and martial artist, did the fight choreography (along with input from Ip Man's son, Ip Chun). There's some wire work, but it doesn't become the focus of the action, either. Wing chun as a style is presented accurately, too, showing its ability to control the center line and to defend and attack simultaneously. And the famous rapid fire \\"wing chun blitz\\" is also shown several times.<br /><br />Ip Man is of course famous in the west as the teacher of Bruce Lee. Wing chun is a very popular style of kung fu in China, and in Hong Kong, where it is primarily based, it's said that 20% of the practitioners study wing chun. The other popular style in Hong Kong is choy li fut. Wing chun is famous for it's rapid and versatile hand techniques, and choy li fut is famous for its many weapons. Wing chun also has the distinction of being the only style of kung fu invented by a woman.<br /><br />I didn't watch the extras on the DVD so I can't comment on those, but the video transfer was fine and I had no complaints there. I also had no trouble with the DVD freezing up and not playing as several people here who gave the movie one star reviews said.<br /><br />With a well developed story, competent acting (especially for a martial arts movie), a good script, and exciting fight scenes, Ip Man delivers on all fronts. I would nominate Ip Man as one of the top 10 martial arts films of all time.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|I think there are three chains of thought when it comes to watching Community. First, those who don't like it (to those I say go watch Family Guy or Two and a Half Men). Second are people who think this is a great show with impressive writing and a superb ensemble cast. The last group believes this program is the second coming of Arrested Development. I personally lean towards the third group but I hesitate in making that comparison at this time. Don't get me wrong. This is the funniest thing on TV due in large part to its creativeness and Joel McHale is a surprisingly good lead that you begin to empathize with over the course of the series (i.e. you will begin to care about him and how he relates to the people around him, which is surprising for a comedy). By the same token this series is still in its infancy and its hard for anyone to say this show will live up to the large shadow the genre's standard bearer has left. Time will tell but by all means do buy this season if for no other reason than the \\"Modern Warfare\\" episode.
B004D82B70|5.0|I always enjoy the comedy episodes of Supernatural and \\"Clap Your Hands\\" was one of the best.  Loved the X-Files spoof intro, and it's always a pleasure watching Jensen Ackles at his goofiest.  The Dean-cam bit where he was frantically running from the fairy in the dark back streets and alleys had me laughing out loud.  For a show that's been on for as long as it has, the writers are still coming up with fresh ideas.

B004B8RWX0|5.0|When Rickk was shot in the line of duty, the worst thing people around him could imagine was the coma he drifted into. When he awoke, however, he found that he was alone in a world gone mad. Instead of a hospital bristling with activbity, he found a scene thatt would send most people over the edge. Luckily he noticed some signs like \\"The dead are here\\" and chains seperating reaching hands from the thing they desired, and he found a mentor. Now wondering where his family could be, he finds himself heading out and trying to find whatever sleeps within Atlanta. A lot more happens from there, including emetings and whatnot, but why spoil the surprise? You need to wonder what Rick will find, if friendship can exist, and if love springs eternal.<br />And the doorknob - ask yourself why that part happens day after day in a land where the dead supposedly don't feel a thing.<br /><br />When it comes to Kirkland and his work, I have always been a fan. Still, I NEVEr imagined something that was done on this scope. If you are a reader of the comic, you will immediately recall the people you see. The character that trains Rick and the people he finds, the things that happen to him and the humanity that drives the story - it is ALL here and more. I was blown away by this experience and, honestly, I wanted the people to succeed. I felt for Rick and his plight and, for someone who has read a lot of these scenarios and has seen more, that's amazing. The dead walk and yet I feel for the people. go figure.<br /><br />The zombies in the series are amazing up to this point. As I review this I am currently on the third episode and, really, it doesn't let up. You have six to content with - on of the things the channel does with shows like Breaking Bad to see if they take - and this show took. If numbers mean something, around 11 million tuned in the first week. And I have to say it touched me. rick has a moment in a park where he sees one of the dead crawling and, as he speaks to it, it made me tear up. You rteally wouldn't expect that in a world gone mad but even the dead make you feel pain and sorror for them. THAT says a lot. The cities are overwhelming in the way they are designed as well, pointing to the things that happened there. you don't have to see the army throw down, for example, to see desperation. you simply see what is left behind and you can feel it. The same goes for the people and the things that they have and need. They talk about creeping into places and they talk about their needs. It makes you think how fast things would go downhill.<br /><br />As far as people go, you also see just how bad they can be. From the way that racism plays a part to the way that people group up, you see boundaries being drawn. You also see the way women are treated and the way men sometimes stand up, also drawing on old conventional attitudes that seriously hurt people's chances in a world where zombies walk and everyone carries a weapon. Feeling tear at people like open wounds, too, and you note how ugly those things can become. That is part of the brillance of the series - it really makes you feel and makes you hate. It also makes you realize that not everyone can be saved - a lesson some characters have to learn harder than others. To me that is a lovely thing, too.<br /><br />Even if you don't like things like ths, The Walking Dead will amaze you. From the fact that being human can be a weakness to the fact that the dead are not truly the monsters out there all ties together. People have tried to make things like this, too, but never like this. If you watch oe thing that is different, watch this and try it on. Really, you only need six nights of your life and you'll find something beautiful. I recommend it to those who like zombies, those who like end of the world scenarios, and those who like people driven shows alike. It is utterly amazing.u rteally wouldn't expect that in a world gone mad but even the dead make you feel pain and sorror for them. THAT says a lot.

B001P9EQH8|3.0|This amplifier worked for a Casio music keyboard I have that has a very low output.  I wanted to be able to hear it on an airplane.  However I tried it with my Sansa Fuze and my Creative MP3 players which have more satisfactory output to begin with and there was no increase in volume or quality of sound.  It would have been nice had it worked on them as well.  I rather think many will be disappointed with this item.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie really does strike various emotional chords within me when I see it. I have seen it once before, about ten years ago, and now being older, more mature, having worked for someone who is Jewish for four years now, and just having more connections overall it's a very hard film to watch. However, the absolute amazing work of Steven Spielberg cannot be denied when it comes to this movie. For the most part, this movie documents the process of the holocaust, and a man named Oskar Schindler who was trying to save lives of those who were being persecuted per their culture without reason, and make a living at the same time. He was a kind hearted man who was for the most part trying to help others, and trying to keep himself out of the horrific spot light of the Germans. The movie documents the various concentration camps that the Jews were forced to live in, as well as the murdering of nearly 600 million Jews over the course of several years. Schindler is basically ensuring those around him who are working in his plant that they would survive and get through this horrific experience that would kill so many in the end. This movie is important to the Jewish faith because I feel that it truly does allow for those who share this faith even more so bond together in a society of people who will never allow their faith to be harmed, even in circumstances like the Holocaust. The movie truly does allow for one to think that even in the most evil of circumstances, and with the most evil of people such as the  Nazi leaders that the Jewish faith stands, and that it cannot be murdered itself.
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|One day I turned my TV on for background noise, while surfing on my computer, and by chance happened on \\"The Fall.\\" My attention was caught quickly by a seductively expressive male voice narrating a wildly exotic story. I was next visually captivated  by sensitively handsome young bedridden patient Roy, with wide-eyed chubby little Alexandria at his side for whom he weaves a wild tale of adventure and revenge. Although you find out that Roy is using his charm and imagination to convince Alexandria to bring him a fatal dose of morphine, it's always clear that the two characters (and actors) have come to adore each other. Roy often adjusts the story midstream at a protest from Alexandria with comic results in the melodramatic acting of the story within the story. The acting between the two is warm, real and moving. I got a little bored during some of the action sequences of the storytelling, but on a repeated viewing I realized that the story, while told by Roy, was seen completely through the eyes of the child, with a child's limited and magical understanding and resulting whimsical touches. As for the hospital scenes, I couldn't tear my eyes away from the duo at the heart of the story. Catinca Untaru is a naturally charming and magnetic screen presence, and even the significant language barrier doesn't prevent her from communicating sensitively and well.  Lee Pace is lovely and natural and I regret not having seen him sooner. As the story progresses, the lives of the storytellers and the characters become dangerously intertwined. I think this movie got dinged by some critics who knew of Singh's video work and were wary of letting themselves be taken in by his magic, but Mr. Singh knows how to tell a story. Hope he does it again.
B001LF2WCC|5.0|It's just what it says: A Complete Experience of the proportions of the unknown... right down to watching the film in it's original blue screen glory!  You've seen the film, I know... so I won't talk about that. What I will say, is that the picture and sound quality are straight cheddar!! (means it's great) This disc goes really deep to get the behind the scenes, deleted stuff, how this was real, even Frank Miller's Graphic Novel makes several appearances!  You Want This In Your Collection!!! The amount of goodies on ONE disc is absurd, but awesome!!

B00364K6YW|5.0|I own the VHS version of this movie and copied it to DVD so I could preserve the tape. I heard the DVD version was not so good.  Problems with sound and colour.  The Blue Ray was supposed to be close to the VHS with brilliant coolours;  Then I saw this version (restored) and bought it.  I did not compare it with the VHS version.  I did not have to.  Sound was clear.  The colour was really good.  I enjoyed the extra material that was on the DVD. I have watched it twice since I bought it.  I own 4 versions of this movie, and I'm sure it will become my favourite. If anyone is sitting on the fence about buying this version, hop off the fence and buy it.  You won[t be disappointed.
0439023491|5.0|CATCHING FIRE, the second book in the Hunger Games trilogy by Suzanne Collins, is another page turner.  I simply could not put it down and again read it straight through in about a day and ½.  Ms. Collins clearly knows how to write!  She captivates her audience, literally ensnares them, forcing them to read until the very last word.<br /><br />Picking up seamlessly where THE HUNGER GAMES left off, CATCHING FIRE begins with Peeta and Katniss about to start their victory tour through Panem.  As a victor of the Hunger Games, Katniss at last feels a margin of safety:  her family will have enough food, enough money, and a warm place to live, and Katniss will never need to compete in the arena again.  However, President Snow is a cruel, evil, devious man, and he cannot tolerate what he considers Katniss's trickery in the survival of both of the tributes from District 12.  So the rules are changed, and Katniss and Peeta must again fight to the death in the games.  Can the two survive again?  Or will only one come out alive?<br /><br />Suzanne Collins is a master of plotting, characterization, tension, and atmosphere.  CATCHING FIRE actually made me nervous; I couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, and couldn't relax.  I kept looking over my shoulder, the feel of the arena and the feel of terror were so strong.  But despite all of this (or in addition to it), the overarching story of the Hunger Games trilogy deepens in CATCHING FIRE.  We learn more about each district, about the tyranny of the Capitol, and about the treachery Panem politics.  We also learn more about the characters, what holds them together, what breaks them, and what they need to hold on to the last modicum of humanity.<br /><br />CATCHING FIRE is compelling, action-packed, and introspective.  If you loved the HUNGER GAMES, you will love CATCHING FIRE.  And if you are like me, you won't be able to put it down.  HIGHTLY RECOMMENDED.<br /><br />NOTE:  I began reading this trilogy because both my 13 year old daughter and my husband couldn't stop talking about them.  Now I understand why.and my husband couldn't stop talking about them.  Now I understand why.

0439023513|4.0|Let me say right up front that I really enjoyed MOCKINGJAY, book three in the Hunger Games trilogy, and as you can tell from my reviews of book one and book two in this series, I've loved them as well. I've raved Suzanne Collins' superb writing, plotting, and characterization, and most of that is still true with MOCKINGJAY.  But, I do have to say that this installment is a lot slower than its predecessors, and it falls victim to bellybutton gazing, teen angst, and a general malaise. I get that the main characters, especially Katniss, have been through the mill and have to somehow find the strength to keep on going; however, Ms. Collins got this across to the readers much more ably in her previous two books.  In MOCKINGJAY (while I still like it) I felt intentionally dragged through the mud, beaten with a stick, and forced to watch soap operas, along the way to getting to the end of the trilogy.  This book has more gore than its predecessors, and one or two deaths seem completely unnecessary.  MOCKINGJAY concludes with what can only be described as a \\"happy\\" ending, with the quotes around happy being a requirement. I completely acknowledge the author's right to do all of these things, but I can see a number of ways to achieve the main story goals without the reader abuse.<br /><br />Still, MOCKINGJAY is a very good read and a satisfying end to the trilogy. I wholeheartedly recommend the Hunger Games series, including this final installment, MOCKINGJAY.  3.5 stars rounded up to 4 stars on strength of the overall trilogy.
B00498YZH8|5.0|This is the epic story of a modern-day Odysseus. This time Odysseus is a seventeen-year-old girl, Ree Dolly, who is touchingly portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence. Ree lives in the Missouri Ozarks, in a hard pocket of rural poverty.    Several of the people in her life, including close relatives, hold the law in contempt, deal drugs, and are quick to violence. I contend that her foes, which include ignorance, brutality, and a twisted code of silence, are as monstrous as any confronted by the ancient Greek hero.    Her father is missing. So Ree must try to raise two much younger siblings by herself. She must also care for her mother, who is mentally incompetent. (Ree is the one who believes she \\"must\\" do these things.) Her father, before he vanished, put the family house and surrounding land up for bond so he could stay out of jail on drug charges. Apparently, the father's main problem was crank, the drug of choice for many in Ree's world.    If she loses the property, as she will if the father skips bail, Ree has nothing. She is determined to find her father, so she starts asking questions. She is asking people who despise snitches and have the self-control of a very hungry lion. Miraculous, it seems to me, is how this film captures the glimmer of respect in the eyes of these lowlifes when they recognize Ree's courage.    Simply put, the film is brilliant. The cinematography is splendid, capturing the spirit of a wintry world of rusting abandoned cars in the yard and burnt-out shacks. The shacks burned down when meth labs exploded. Occupational hazard.    The acting is, without exception, most effective. Especially notable, in addition to Jennifer Lawrence, is John Hawkes, who is Ree's Uncle Teardrop. Is he the uncle from hell or the uncle from heaven? That is the question.    It builds to a conclusion that may be more terrifying than your worst nightmare.
0385533829|5.0|\\"The lost symbol\\" was my first Dan Brown book and it turned me into an instant fan.  This is a must read for all suspense,thriller afficionados.  The book is intriguingly fast-paced,skillfully written,spell-bindingly suspenseful with more twists and turns than a tortuous mountain road.I give it five stars and two thumbs up.
B003Q6D27S|5.0|I know alot of people didn't appreciate this one very much. But I say different. I feel as though this one is the better of the series. Went to see it opening day. When watching the film the only worry I had was the lack of Cary Elwes. I was like, thats it? is he only getting 5 minutes. lol but when it neared the ending, I was pleased. The ending was exactly how I predicted it. Yes, I am very sad that this is the last. Oh well, it was a great 6 years and 7 awesome movies. The ending was the best of all the series right behind the first!     I'd give this installment 10 stars just for its awesomeness!
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|I really didn't care for this book. I hope the second one Die Trying is better. If Jack Reacher shrugged one more time, I think I was going to scream. There were some good parts though that I was able to fly through, but a lot of the book was unrealistic even for Rambo (which Jack Reacher is not!). It was like reading a really bad script for another Dwayne Johnson movie flop. I already bought the second one, so we'll see if Lee Child story telling gets better.

B00171LFFU|5.0|\\"Moondance\\" from 1970 is one of Van Morrison's most acclaimed albums. For me, this definitely a deserved recognition. Morrison's vocals are as always soulful and convincing, so it is especially his songwriting which is unusually consistent and inspired here.  All his albums include great songs, of course, but few as many as this one. Compared with \\"Astral Weeks\\", which is often considered Morrison's best , the songwriting on \\"Moondance\\" is less improvisational, which for me is a clear strength.<br /><br />Stylewise Morrison works on the border between blues, soul, jazz, gospel and rock.<br /><br />It opens strong with \\"It Stoned Me\\", which both melodically  and lyrically displays Morrison's great talent for songwriting. The jazzy title track is a favorite among many fans; personally I'm not a big fan of jazz, so it may actually be my least favourite song on the album.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Love\\" is a soul inspired ballad. It can be hard to recognize Morrison's voice, which here may remind you of Sam Cooke: at any rate a great song.<br /><br />\\"Caravan\\" is classic Morrison; a song which would have fitted Robbie Robertson's \\"The Band\\" perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Into the Mystic\\" is for me the outstanding track. Great catchy tune. Leads my thought back to the overlooked Them-song \\"Mighty Like a Rose\\"<br /><br />With \\"Come Running\\" the speed goes up; a gospel inspired thing, which adds a lot to the positive and optimistic mood and tone of the album.<br /><br />\\"These Dreams of You\\" is an easy little r & b thing.<br /><br />More Sam Cooke / The Band inspiration comes with the next key-track, \\"Brand New Day\\".<br /><br />The positive mood continues on \\"Everyone\\", which in addition to its nice melody is also remarkable in being almost pop-psych - a genre you rarely find Morrison connected to.<br /><br />The final track \\"Glad Tidings\\" may be the nearest Morrison has come to writing a new \\"Brown Eyed Girl\\" - maybe not quite in the same league as this classic, but still a nice conclusion to an album that shows a Morrison from his optimistic and musically very inspired side.on to an album that shows a Morrison from his optimistic and musically very inspired side.
B002L5GQGY|2.0|I heard a good Bonamassa song on XM one day, and was later in the store and decided to take a chance on this dvd after hearing that one song. Man was that a mistake; should of gone with Curb Your Enthusiasm. At least I know Larry David will make me laugh. I was reading through the reviews and one of the other reviewers commented that the performance was \\"contrived.\\" I couldn't agree more. Everything was forced, sounded the same and was generally flat.    Another reviewer noted that they thought Bonamassa was trying to imitate Jeff Beck. I can agree with that but I think he is also trying to sound like Gary Moore. The problem is, though, that Bonamassa doesn't come close to those guys. Bonamassa doesn't have the phrasing, note selection, or the heart. And quit changing guitars for every song. You are supposed to be versatile to have many sounds on one guitar.    This was so bad that I immediately had to go to youtube and watch some BBM (Jack Bruce, Ginger Baker, and Gary Moore, aka Cream 2.0) to get the bad taste out of my mouth.
0525951652|1.0|I used to enjoy Ken Follet's novels.<br />Sometimes, I even found them thoroughly outstanding - e.g. The Pillars of The Earth.<br />But Fall of Giants belongs to a very different kind of literature: the self-conceited one.<br />In other words, bad literature.<br />Mr Follet's latest book is awfully boring, thematically inconsistent and historically irrelevant.<br />It's seems to have been written by another author, totally out of his depth.<br />I mean, It's a most unprofessional work.<br />If you want to know IWW story, read Liddell Hart's.<br />And if you look for fun, switch to Disney.<br />His plots are much less shallow and ill-conceived.
B001VNB54A|5.0|It seems that a lot of people say that the \\"The Pacific\\".  Is anti Marine/American and that actions seen in it never happened. As well that Tom Hanks is a scum bag for making it.  So, let me ask you this. Would you tell E.B Sledge that his book or Robert Lekie that they are anti Marine if they were alive today.  I have read \\"With The Old Breed\\" and this series shows what Sledge wrote in his account.  Of course we did brutal things in the war, its war!  The men that fought in the battles saw what the Japanese did to their friends and others.  So, they hated them it made good people do bad things so they and others could make it home.  So, that I can sit here on my butt getting fat typing this.  You that speak ill of this series read \\"With The Old Breed\\" and you will think different.  This was the most emotional thing I have ever watched in my 26 years of life.  I am not ashamed to say I cried many times throughout it and the interviews at the end. This is the stuff that kids should learn in school.

B003ZHQVJO|2.0|I knew from all the pre release press that this was going to be a different type of record for Rock but really?  This is the end result?  Very bland music from start to finish.  This is the kind of record one would put on as background music while you went about your daily business.  It won't offend anyone but it also will not be memorable to anyone either.  I have always enjoyed his music and enjoy the fact that artists grow and change but this just isn't a very good record. It reminds me a lot of the direction that Uncle Kracker has taken in his last couple of releases.  Please do not try to fool your audience.  Folks from Michigan get it.  Just let folks know this is a pop/country release, not rock.  You will pick up new fans with this release as it will appeal to a broader audience of country fans.  However, you will also lose some of your core base as this is not anything that will appeal to them.  My purchase has already been sold on the used market while I can still get a couple $$ for it.
B00004STDN|5.0|I saw this movie on AMC and I love it!  I ordered the collectors edition, and it arrived in great condition!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|I'm really surprised that the show does not have a larger following. It is definitely at the top of my listing for television programs to watch. Its very original in its content and has a great cast of characters played by a talented group of actors.
B003KRJNBW|1.0|I am stunned that this movie ever got made. The storyline was ridiculous, there was no character development and the conclusion (\\"God did it\\") was such a letdown I'm making a point to avoid this director's movies in the future. A God-sent ninja saves the world by remembering the Bible, word for word? Ugh, I feel ill.
0470876417|3.0|&#34;Business Model Generation&#34; is a breezy read and a well-organized introduction to several related topics including: basic types of business models, techniques and strategies for generating ideas and thinking creatively about them, along with process steps for moving good ideas forward. But the promising title makes it sound like this is a more substantive resource than it really is.<br /><br />PROS: Anyone new to these topics would likely have to read four to six separate books to get the broad coverage you'll find here. The authors have done a service for folks who want to come up to speed more quickly. I felt that I came away with some useful info in most of the chapters and each has additional references for further reading. The designers also deserve some credit for a creative and varied layout that makes the text seem fresher.  Plus, you can feel good about yourself as you plow through 50+ pages in half an hour without fatigue.  The bonus: this is a business book that won't have you drowning in business jargon.<br /><br />CONS:  As several reviewers have noted, there's breadth here but not much depth on the core topics. Those expecting more may be disappointed and some may find the book's suggestive title misleading.  Probably more accurate if they called it &#34;A *PRIMER* for Business Model Generation&#34; instead of a Handbook.  It's a place to get started, not a definitive resource as the term handbook implies. Finally, the small font sizes that a few reviewers mentioned will surely be difficult to read for those with less-than-great eyesight.
B00421IR5I|5.0|\\"Le petit Nicolas\\" (2009) is a live-action adaptation of French children's book series. Unfortunately I haven't read any of the original stories of \\"Little Nicolas\\" (created by René Goscinny and illustrated by Jean-Jacques Sempé), though I read somewhere the books are very popular in France. Well, never mind if you haven't read them either, for \\"Le petit Nicolas\\" is a pleasant and amusing film that everyone can enjoy.    The film's story revolves around \\"Little Nicolas,\\" a happy, good-natured and sensitive boy who loves his parents, and a group of his unique friends (mostly boys). No one, not even their dedicated (and kind) teacher or the pompous school superintendent, can stop the ever-resourceful children from having fun. They are not rude. They are not disobedient. The boys are just having a good time, doing their best to do something good for friends. It is only that their \\"good\\" is not exactly what most adults would think. For these boys, hiring a gangster over the phone is nothing special.    Set in the 50s-like nostalgic world, the film has two main stories: one about Nicolas's (groundless) fear of being abandoned by his own parents; the other about Nicolas's parents arranging a dinner with his hard-working father's boss for his promotion. These two storylines, both unpredictable and interspersed with amusing episodes, keeps a brisk pace throughout, before it concludes with a nice finale.     The 91-minute film is helmed by Laurent Tirard, whose works as director includes an engaging romantic comedy \\"Molière.\\" With its unanimously fine cast and skillful storytelling (that sometimes becomes pleasantly satirical), \\"Le petit Nicolas\\" keeps you entertained until the end. Also, a very creative opening credit animation should not be missed.    Gérard Jugnot, star of \\"Les choristes,\\" (2004) appears briefly in the chorus scene.
B000A468XY|5.0|This is a wonderful, beautiful movie for adult and children alike.  Brings back so many memories of childhood.   Received the Movie quickly from the dealer.  Just the way expected.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I'm not going to repeat what every other review has said. I will just say that I completely agree with the positive ones.
030745455X|5.0|This series keeps getting better and better! I love the first book and thought that Larsson played the characters brilliantly. With this book, he didn't hesitant on giving his twist that will make you say, \\"What??? Is that for real?\\" I mean I had that same feeling near the end of the book. When I thought that it was great with how the story goes, then I read another twist which makes the book so explosive.<br /><br />This is a great read especially for people like me that loves mystery suspense.Well my comment again like with the first book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, I had a hard time keeping track of the characters and remember the name. I don't even know what Folken means. I keep on forgetting who was who as sometimes I'm lost in the book but I managed. Another is the ending. I mean, it is indeed open ended because the story will continue in the final book but I felt it was a little short. But the ending was indeed what made me more excited to read the last book immediately. I am certainly recommending this book to those who haven't read it yet. If you happen to have this in your TBR pile, pick it up
B0000009SI|5.0|This is a great album of Frank's music. One of many. I would recomend this CD if you've never listened to Frank and want to see what he was about.
0316044938|4.0|This was a great book, an exceptional read from a great author. It talks about the death of a child being murdered and it became an unresolved case over the years. At first it was such a slow read, I nearly gave up reading the book after the second chapter. For me, it also was confusing at time because the book is being narrative as it seems by the murdered child. She talks about one thing and the next paragraph is totally different from the previous. But the main purpose of the book was to help us realized the worth of life in a way that you'll understand that death of one doesn't mean the death of all. It's hard talking about this when I myself experience death of a family member and it made me hard to cope. The book will certainly give you a lighter feeling of grief, that life doesn't stop when you loose a love one. In a way, the book can be a companion through the grieving process and when one is in denial.      The ending seems flat, like there's something missing. But the story seems to overcome the books short comings. Alice Sebold wrote a magnificent book that people can relate to. Read the book, you'll know what I mean.
B00275EHJQ|1.0|paid a premium price for the Blu-ray DVd and it won't even play. I am fed up with the formatting of Disney DVD products which make it difficult to watch what you paid for, without navigating through an annoying array of trailers and ads, and having their product try to download their own software. And when I do try to ferret through the trail of \\"support\\" they provide with their Blu-ray product, I get a page of ads. Screw them. The Emperor is naked.
015206396X|5.0|I've finished this book under a week and it was such an adventure. Graceling is about Katsa who become a hunter/assassin/weapon for a manipulative king because Katsa is one of the many people who is gifted with a certain \\"grace\\". In this book, the word grace is used for people who have special abilities in various forms: Swimming, hunting, dancing, fishing, etc. Katsa with one eye green and the other blue is gifted with a grace of a fighter making her an effective assassin that is feared throughout the seven kingdoms.    Graceling is the first book of a series by Cashore and is promoted for 14 y/o and above but a little caution for parents because Graceling includes topics that you don't want your 14 y/o to read but it this book would be a great way to discuss such topics with your kids. The book contains topic about not wanting marriage and the concept of it, some sex scenes which are not detailed but for conservative parents you might want to talk through your children first and a lot of fight scenes.    The main pull of the book for me is the plot. It is a great book especially if you favor adventure/fantasy books but Graceling also includes a love story between Katsa and  another character but I guarantee that it is not the mushy type. Another reason why I picked up the book is the lovely cover art as you can see above.  In the front cover you'll see Katsa's eye but if you look at the back, you'll see both eyes. Just seeing the cover gives you an idea what the book is about. The only thing lacking in the book in my opinion is the battle scene between Katsa and the villain. It should have contained more than what is written. I just felt that Cashore built the story with every chapter and when the confrontation part began, it ended abruptly. I felt that Cashore should have dedicated a chapter or more, included more conflict and the book would have been perfect.    Overall, Graceling is a must read! I would recommend this book to anybody but noting the caution to parents. If your child shows intention of reading the book, parents read the book first and decide if your child is ready for this novel. If you don't think this book is for your kid, this is a great way to explain to the child why. Asides from that, I agree with fellow reviewers on their remark about Graceling.
0061433047|5.0|I loved this book.  I loved that Tiffany has grown so believably from the first book through the fourth.  I loved that the story tackled such big issues.  I loved that Tiffany visited Ahnk Morpork and fit so nicely into the larger Discworld.  I loved seeing Carot and Anqua and Vimes (I always love seeing Vimes) and The Times and everything that makes the Discworld such a fully realized and amazingly created place.  I loved the plot.  I loved the sense of threat.    And boy did I love the ending.  It was beautiful.  It was done so well.  It actually brought a tear to my eye.    To me, each Tiffany Aching/Wee Free Men book has been better than the last.     And I loved how even beyond Tiffany's trip to Ahnk Morpork, this book tied into so many other Discworld novels (even more so than the other Tiffany books), with references to or characters from many previous books.  In addition to the members of the watch mentioned above, Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg appear (as they tend to do in the Wee Free Men books), and so does Magrat.  References are made to events in Discworld books as diverse as Carpe Jugulum, Sourcery, and Small Gods, in addition to the previous Tiffany books. Unseen University and its library are discussed, along with a running joke about Wizards staffs that has come up in more than one Rincewind book.  What's amazing is that even if this was your very first Discworld book, you could appreciate it competely and feel as if you didn't miss anything, but as is so often the case with Mr. Pratchett's books, the more of them you read, the more rewarding each one becomes.      With the Discworld, Mr. Pratchett has created a world that is as complex and well designed as anything in literature--from my reading, only Robert Jordan's 14 massive-book Wheel of Time series comes close--and all the while Mr. Pratchett assembles some of the smartest, funniest, cleverest, most beautiful, and most simply truthfull sentences I've ever read.  I have been choked up and touched more than once by the things that he's written.  Even better, unlike some humorous writers, Mr. Pratchett's comedy never comes at the expense of the story, but rather enhances and illuminates it. And on top of all that, he has created some of my favorite characters of all time (Sam Vimes being right at the top of that list, but Granny and Tiffany and Rob Anybody are all fantastic as well, as are Carot and the Patrician (definitely the Patrician).  And Death, and of course Moist Von Lipwig, (and I could go on and on). Preston, a character just introduced in this book is great as well (although he hasn't had the time to become as iconic and solid and real as so many of the Discworld regulars have)).  It's because his writing is so true and his characters are so good that Mr. Pratchett's books can be so touching.    I look forward to the release of every Terry Pratchett book, and after I finish reading one, I look forward to re-reading it a second and even a third time.  I have a lot of authors I enjoy, but no other author I consistently re-read.  There are generally too many new books for me to have time to go back to old books, but with Terry Pratchett the books and the series are so well structured and the prose is so brilliantly conceived, re-reads are generally just as rewarding as the first time through.    Back to the point--this is a great book, well worth reading, wholly enjoyable, and highly recommended.  If it truly is the last Tiffany book, it's a fantastic send off (and of course it's more than a little sad to say goodbye).  The whole book is fun and funny and touching, and the ending is brilliantly done.  If it is a goodbye to Tiffany, it's a sad one because I will miss her little corner of the Discworld, but it couldn't have been done any better, and I thank Mr. Pratchett for it.
030726999X|5.0|I just finished reading the last installment to the Millennium series and it was insanely good! It meet my expectation that Larsson will end with a big WOW and until the last page, Larsson created a remarkable series that ought to be in everybody's bookshelf.<br /><br />The series was a remarkably easy read though it's a thick book. The characters were well thought of and you wouldn't be left guessing because Larsson details every person and is written in an incredible story that is believable. Do you ever read a book and stopped midway because of the somewhat unrealistic or too common plot? Well this series is different. With all three books, I though I know how the story will unravel, what the climax is and how the next book might be written out. BUT I was wrong in all accounts.<br /><br />So to sum it up, if you have this on your shelf - READ IT.<br />If you don't know what to give a friend who loves mystery and suspence - BUY THIS.<br />If you haven't heard of this book - RESEARCH AND BUY THIS.<br />If you don't like mystery and suspense novel - TRY THIS FIRST.
B003UYUR10|3.0|A big disappointment both from critics and from paying audiences.  And the Disney logo didn't really help now that the general consensus among teens boys - the core demographic for this film -- is that it will be overblown and sentimentally sweet and devoid of any substance.<br /><br />That said, I enjoyed the film for the extraordinarily well-rendered production and art design that made believable the world of the story.<br /><br />There were ethnic protests that a Persian actor didn't play the lead, but Gyllenhaal is just fine as the rogue prince and he is in great shape and obviously does a lot of his own stunts.<br /><br />Adapted from a video game (by its creator Jordan Mechner) it went through some strange permutations from the popular side-scrolling puzzler that began it all to the needlessly complicated film.  Mike Newell has a fine eye and a sure hand in the vistas and the action.<br /><br />But if you want to enter an exotic realm, this one will deliver on looks alone.  Take the ride to a world beyond the pale.
0307454541|5.0|I love reading thriller and mysteries, and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was worth it with every turn of a page. It was fast paced, a lot of twist and turns. I actually kept thinking throughout the book. Even after reading the book, I still think about it. Stieg Larsson wrote an incredible good read. The only comment that I will make though is that, the order of the scenes should have been different. The affair between the Millennium magazine and Wennerstr&ouml;m should have been written before the ending and not as the ending. It would have had a better impact if the story about Harriet was the last to be read. Another is that, well it's Swedish names i think so I had a hard time remembering the names and there were too many individuals that was written when Larsson should have just left it out.<br /><br />If you love a good mystery and likes a twisty plot, you should pick up the book. It definitely made me want more.
B004132I20|5.0|I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this terrific updating of Sir Arthur Ignatius Conan Doyle's iconic detective transferred into 21st century London.  Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson's exciting new adventures are witty, puzzling and fast-paced.  Although not yet widely discovered, for me this is by far the best detective show on TV<br /><br />Doyle was a Scottish eye doctor apparently with a lot of spare time.  He wrote to amuse himself and I assume to ward off boredom.  His original names for Holmes and Watson were Sheridan and Ormond.  But renamed Sherlock and Watson, they became the most famous detective duo of all time.  There are many who assume the pair actually operated out of the residence at 221B Baker Street.  Every year, thousands of tourists visit the real address of the fictional detectives' home in London.<br /><br />The BBC series was co-created by Steven Moffat (Doctor Who, Coupling) and Mark Gatiss and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as Holmes and Martin Freeman as his loyal friend Doctor John Watson (who is freshly back from Afghanistan may be somewhat traumatized).  Rupert Graves plays Inspector Lestrade.<br /><br />All the details from Doyle's original stories remain.  Especially the dark and strange psychology of the difficult to love, brilliant and somewhat disturbed Holmes.  In the series, Holmes corrects someone who labels him a psychopath.  He says he's a \\"high functioning sociopath.<br /><br />There are three superb episodes in Season One: \\"A Study in Pink,\\" \\"The Blind Banker\\" and \\"The Great Game.\\"
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I enjoy a very diverse range of music, and Norah Jones new album \\"Featuring Norah Jones\\" is a great example of many types of music including her usual style. I love that she chose so many different artists to share this album with her. You get a great sampling of rap, country, jazz, and rock and roll. I have always been a fan of her voice and really appreciated the collaboration she has done with a diverse group of artists! Really enjoyed it!
B001VNB54A|4.0|WWII's Pacific Theater as seen through the eyes and emotions of three Marines -- Robert Leckie, John Basilone and Eugene Sledge - is the epic, 10-part miniseries that artfully recaptures extraordinary combat, heroism and loss of these intertwined lives as they fight the Japanese.  It's all here in a wide range of terrifying terrain -- from the spirit infested jungles of Guadalcanal, through the nearly impassable rain forests of Cape Gloucester, along the coral strongholds of Peleliu, up the dark steep of Iwo Jima and the fatal fields of Okinawa to the final, uneasy return home -- for some, the scariest place of all.<br /><br />In a way, the experience of this powerful show informs and perhaps transforms the viewer with a sense of the physical and psychological toll combat requires when up against a relentless enemy unlike any in modern warfare up to this point.<br /><br />Now, it's the Taliban who seek a similar holy victory in a desert theater.  As the French say, \\"Plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose.\\"
B000K15VSA|5.0|This is the NICEST box set for a single movie i have ever gotten. The case is nice and sturdy. the dvds are nicely tucked in there and the extras are spectacular. the only downside is the little police car is rather cheap. Its pretty lightweight and slightly flimsy. But that doesn't really matter unless youre going to play with it. So this is a 10 out of 10
B003EYVXT6|1.0|Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley play superstar geneticists with a knack for splicing DNA from diverse species to create new hybrids that can be used for pharmaceuticals.  The Brody and Polley characters are also a couple when they go home from the lab.<br /><br />When a conflict with a sponsoring company bans some of their research, they continue, but hide their work.  In fact, they take their work home with them.  Big mistake.<br />Driven by their dangerous curiosity, a fast growing mutant, humanoid-like creature, Dren, is the result of their secret experiments.  Of course things get out of hand.<br /><br />This promising film goes off the rails and loses whatever theme it set out to explore.<br /><br />Too bad, there are lots of relevant issues here that resonate with daily headlines about the morality of harvesting embryonic cells.  Also, I thought the creature was not consistent in its appearance.<br /><br />I think we were supposed to feel sympathy if not affection for Dren, but that never really came across.

B001G8XON0|4.0|It may look like Paris of the 1890s, with can-can dancers, bohemian denizens like artist Toulouse-Lautrec (John Leguizamo), and bawdy diversions around every corner and on sidestreet, but in fact it's a fever dream from Baz Luhrmann's fantastical, over-heated brain.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is electric.  She sizzles in Lurhmann's dazzling, sometimes frustrating movie musical that attempts to jump-start a 21st century version of a story set in the infamous Parisian night club.<br /><br />Boundaries are shattered and time warps in the fast cutting frenzy that blends music and even technologies from different eras.<br /><br />\\"Moulin Rouge\\" is kaleidoscopic, absinthe-inspired orgy of extraordinary sets, dazzling costumes, snippets of amazing tunes and incredible digital wizardry all finessed into what lingers as an ephemeral memory of a lucid dream that brushes up against the promise of ecstasy.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Nice and contemporary rendition, showcasing all of Annie's traditional strengths.Being a fan, I do have to object to God Rest ye Merry Gentlemen and Lullay Lullay being so ominous. Ok, the second one is gloomy in essence anyway, but the intro to this version is downright scary! :) And the first one is angry, harsh and digital in Annie's rendition. But overall, this album will get a lot of play this season.
B00275EHJQ|4.0|Every Pixar film has been a box office and critical success.  The latest iteration of the Toy Story series milks the generational span of the fans that were kids for the first in the series.  In the film, the toys are packed up and stored or discarded when their master, Andy, leaves for college.<br /><br />The journey the toys must take is a metaphor for the perils and spiritual fears many of us experience in real life.  The toys take a journey that literally leads to the gates of hell -- a yawning, gaping, molten fire-pit at a mammoth recycling center.  Not sure what the lesson is here, or how Jung might explain the symbolic meaning of the events and the identity of the toys themselves.  I always thought it was interesting that the two leads were called Buzz and Woody.  Drugs and sex seemed to more than an accidental inference.  There are other subversive moments disguised as a kid's movie.<br /><br />This is a reverse coming of age movie in which a human character comes to terms with his childhood and the non-human characters continue with their imagined lives.  But in whose head are they dwelling.  We all know they are merely inanimate, non-sentient toys.  Don't we?<br /><br />All the original voice talent are back including Tom Hanks and Tim Allen plus Michael Keaton as Ken and Ned Beatty as Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear.<br />The Blu-ray transfer, both image and sound, is simply breathtaking, certainly cutting edge.  There's something hypnotic about the world of the story and the incredible attention to detail -- especially the physics of the movement, the texture and lighting.  The generous extras will fascinate for hours and hours.

B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|There was a poster popular during the 60s that showed the bound giant ape from the 1933 film on a stage with his arms outstretched under the caption: \\"King King died for your sins.\\"<br /><br />Some saw it as blasphemy, or a mockery of the Christian religion.  While others of a more astute state of mind recognized the metaphor of the ferocious primitive instinct succumbing to the modern savagery of civilization with the bait of impossible sexuality and intimacy as a reward.<br /><br />Much has been written about the power of Kong's imagery and its impact when it was first released during the lingering great depression.<br /><br />Is there anyone who does not yet realize how we have sacrificed and exploited the finite resources of the primal world for our temporary gain?  What have we forever lost in the process?<br /><br />This week, Warner Home Video releases a newly remastered Blu-ray KING KONG (1933) with extensive bonus content, including a collectible Blu-ray Book written by renowned film historian Rudy Behlmer; a feature length documentary on Kong creator Merian C. Cooper, directed by acclaimed filmmakers Kevin Brownlow and Christopher Bird; commentary by Ray Harryhausen, Ken Ralston with vintage audio clips from Cooper and star Fay Wray; and a seven-part documentary that delves deeply into just about every aspect of the creation and production of this truly iconic film.<br /><br />With 32 pages of rare photographs and trivia, the captivating Blu-ray Book centers around the vision of director Cooper and his lager than life persona that brought the story of KING KONG to the screen.<br /><br />Film historian Behlmer interviewed Cooper and has written numerous books and contributed to many documentaries about Hollywood's Golden Age.<br /><br />This very special Blu-ray release is a newly remastered presentation of the 1933 premiere print in its entirety.  It includes controversial scenes that were cut from later re-releases.  Max Steiner's rousing score still stirs the blood.<br /><br />KING KONG was a milestone in movie making with pioneering special effects that incorporated miniaturization, stop-motion photography, rear screen inserts with miniatures and real sets.  The movie works on many levels beyond the obvious amalgam of adventure, monster, romance and horror.<br /><br />The film was way ahead of its time and defied the technological limitations of the 1930s.  Special effects pioneer Willis O'Brien was incredibly imaginative and effective -- even in today's era of photorealistic CGI effects.<br /><br />Although Peter Jackson's superb remake touches all the deeper emotional levels of Cooper's original story and is indeed a loving tribute, there remains something powerful and profound about this amazing piece of art that resonates with us today.<br /><br />See again this magnificent, strikingly original film directed and produced by Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack with stars Robert Armstrong, Bruce Cabot and Fay Wray whose indelible performance as distressed Ann Darrow forever locked Wray into the upper echelons of pop culture as the original \\"scream queen\\" and a role model of a resilient, independent woman for generations to come.<br /><br />Not long ago, someone sent me a piece of digitally Photoshopped art that shows the incoming terrorist jets approaching the World Trade Center and a still shackled Kong perched atop the twin towers taking down the planes before they can do their damage.  The caption: \\"Where was Kong when we needed him?\\"  Indeed.<br /><br />Merian Caldwell Cooper was a tough, adventurous guy.  He was the real deal.  He made several documentaries in wild, remote areas with his filmmaking partner Ernst B. Schoedsack.  But he invested everything he had in his planned production of a fictional depiction of an expedition that finds a great ape surviving from another age on an unmapped island.  When Cooper wrote his treatment for the movie, he said he had the ending before anything else.  \\"It was beauty killed the beast,\\" he said.  That may be true, but with this new hi-def disc, King Kong lives forever.

B003W5C0VM|3.0|The Rolling Stones legendary \\"Exiles on Main Street\\" concert tour of 1972 was filmed and released in theaters for a limited engagement 1974. Shot over four nights in Texas, the film has remained largely unseen - until now.  And fully restored and remastered in Blu-ray!<br /><br />That said, it maybe hi-def, but this is a poorly filmed but rousing concert.  Much better heard than seen.  So turn up the volume and enjoy this classic Stones concert with its exuberant, pitch perfect performances of iconic tracks from the late '60s and early '70s.  Forget the grainy, shadowy images and poor composition that does not do justice to the songs or Stones.<br /><br />Bonus material includes previously unreleased rehearsal footage filmed in Switzerland and interviews with Mick Jagger from 1972 and this year (2010.  He also half apologizes for the bad cinematography and editing.

She is so talented and gifted. Her voice is amazing and different than the normal musician today. This collection is sincere and vibrant. There is so much variety and I was delighted. My favorite song by far is \\"Virginia Moon\\" featuring Foo Fighters. Loved hearing Ray Charles on \\"Here We Go Again.\\" Duets with Dolly Parton and Willie Nelson are not to be missed either. What a collection!
B001992NW4|4.0|By general consensus, this is the scariest of all mainstream films.  Now making its \\"historic Blu-ray premiere\\" just in time for Halloween.<br /><br />Both versions are included here.  The original 1973 theatrical release and the 2000 Extended Director's Cut.<br /><br />Exceedingly disturbing, crude, violent and blasphemous, the story unfolds like a documentary in which an increasingly frantic mother tries to get help for her sweet, innocent daughter who manifests evidence of a demon within.  The unthinkable becomes a battle in which two priests - one solid in his faith, the other doubt ridden - fight the malevolent entity.<br /><br />Extras in the two-disc set include a new 3-part making of documentary.  There are two commentaries, one with director William Friedkin and the other with writer/producer William Peter Blatty.  Also included is the feature length 1988 documentary \\"The Fear of God: Making the Exorcist.\\"<br /><br />Something weird about Friedkin's original commentary.  Maybe he thought he was doing it for the visually impaired?<br /><br />The questions remain:  Can humans really be possessed by a non human entity or a demon?  And what happens when we rational human beings encounter the irrational?  That's what's horrific and even more so in hi-def.

B003VS0CX8|5.0|What more can one say about one of the more, perhaps the most beloved, of American family films?<br /><br />It's hard to believe this is the 45th Anniversary Edition, now in Blu-ray, and it has never looked or sounded better.<br /><br />What makes this a perfect film is that it is a journey of a real-life family who only wanted to add harmony to a world facing a real evil.  And the other thing that works so well is that even though it might be labeled a \\"musical,\\" all the music is internally derived from performances within the story by a family whose job it is to sing.  Not bad for those who hate contrived singing and dancing!<br /><br />On top of all this, besides the perfect story, casting and direction (Robert Wise at the peak of his powers), it includes a love story (really a double love story) and a harrowing journey over the Alps - a glimpse of heaven? - on their journey to freedom.<br /><br />Julie Andrews is almost incandescent as Maria, the spirited young woman who brings love and music to the home of Captain von Trapp (Christopher Plummer) and his seven children.<br /><br />Rodgers & Hammerstein must be spinning -- with delight -- in their graves.  Whopping extras abound.  This is one for the library.

B003PIUC02|4.0|Nearly non-stop bloody action and sex fill the canvas of this brutal and vastly entertaining interpretation of the Spartacus legend.  He was \\"forced into slavery, betrayed by the Romans and reborn as a gladiator.\\"<br /><br />Hard not to think of Russell Crowe or decades earlier, Kirk Douglas in similar iconic roles<br /><br />Here again is the classic tale of the Republic's most famous rebel shot in a similarly composed surreal as the movie 300.  But now we have the time to ogle the sex and cringes at the slo-mo violence and bloodletting.  Like a graphic novel, the images are meant to grab us with a shocking visceral jolt.<br /><br />But the beating heart of this epic that makes everything work is the love story between Spartacus and his wife Sura.  To survive to love again, \\"he must become more than a man - he must become a legend.\\"  Sounds like a movie poster.  Oh, it is.<br /><br />Andy Whitfield, Lucy Lawless, Manu Bennett, John Hannah and Peter Mensah inhabit their roles.  Generous extras.
B00000ILDF|3.0|There is a reason why the third in any series is usually quite inferior to the first two.  ALIEN 3 is unfortunately representative of this trend.  ALIEN and ALIENS set the standard for claustrophobic suspense, fine acting, terrific camera work, and crackling dialogue.  Here director David Fincher took these criteria and drained from them the inner core of drama that made Ripley a household name. Sigourney Weaver as Ripley tries mightily to be the same butt-kicking leader of men that marked her first two appearances as the \\"Last Officer of the Nostromo.\\"  But unlike those earlier efforts, here she shows little of the gravitas that audiences had come to expect.  This is not entirely her fault since she had a lame script to work with and only a small amount of interaction with the cast that gave ALIEN and ALIENS their tart flavor.  Midway through, we learn the true sequence of events that followed her escape from the world of ALIENS.  She, a marine, Newt, and a mangled Bishop went into hypersleep to keep them alive during the long trip home to earth.  Enroute, a hidden alien appears while they sleep, kills the girl and the marine, and implants a queen embryo within Ripley's chest.  The alien causes a fire which triggers an automatic pod ejection of the stasis machines.  The pod lands on a prison planet housing only the most vicious of male rapists, murderers, and assorted thugs.  Surprisingly, when the planet's doctor (Charles Dance) revives her, she has a brief affair with him.  The creature revives itself and soon begins to pick off the inmates one by one.  Now this sound like a reprise of the first installment, but where director Fincher goes astray is to dilute audience interest by abandoning the attention grabbing core of interest in the battle between the creature and Ripley and introducing a number of subtexts that distract the viewer.  Was it really necessary to invest the inmates with a quasi-religion patina of salvation?  Too much screen time goes to endless philosophizing on the role of redemption for inmates.  Further, we quickly find out that Ripley is in no immediate danger from the alien who oddly enough wants her alive so she can serve as an incubator for the next emerging queen.  Finally, the ending asserts once again the too often device of setting off Corporate Industry as the heavy. We can almost see the director pull the strings to make sure that we \\"get\\" the point. This film was supposed to be the final installment; however, an even more atrocious sequel followed.  For those who want to see Ripley at her best with a script and supporting cast at their best, then ALIENS is the way to go.philosophizing on the role of redemption for inmates.

B003UESJJC|5.0|Nominated for eight Academy Awards and unquestionably one of the truly great films, this masterpiece from director Francis Ford Coppola arrives in stunning high definition for the first time.  The new transfer represents the cutting edge of videodisc 1080p technology and is as perfect as possible.<br /><br />\\"The Full Disclosure Edition\\" (3 disc Blu-ray) includes the original theatrical edition, the \\"Redux\\" edition (Coppola's longer cut) and the startling documentary \\"Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse\\" by Coppola's wife Eleanor.  This unflinching look at the chaotic, calamitous circumstances of the \\"Apocalypse\\" shoot is probably the best making-of documentary about a film's production.  Among the nine hours of extras are extended conversations with actor Martin Sheen and screenwriter John Milius.<br /><br />Based loosely on Joseph Conrad's 1902 novella \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" the film, set during the Vietnam War, recounts the mesmerizing, nightmarish journey of Captain Willard (Sheen) to terminate rogue Green Beret Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) who has barricaded himself in the remote jungle ruins of an ancient temple where he rules the natives and his soldiers like a demented god.<br /><br />Additional features include a 48-page collectible booklet with never-before-seen archives from the set, a storyboard gallery, image galleries, marketing archives and an original script excerpt from John Milius featuring hand-written notes from Coppola.<br /><br />Besides Brando and Sheen, the movie also stars Robert Duvall, Laurence Fishburne (only 14 years old!), Dennis Hopper and Harrison Ford.
B002ZG98LO|5.0|I have seen every movie of Predators, whether the first one or the Alien vs Predator Requiem. This movie to me is excellent and Brody the lead man plays an excellent role. The movie follows a parallel role of the very first Predator movie not knowing who or what is in the jungle as their enemy.The script writers added more about the predator creatures culture. They have a big predator and and a smaller predator in this one.But both predators are cool and toughest enemies to defeat in the jungle, especially with their cloaking device and laser guns. They are just plain awesome.The graphics are very well done.It really seems like the human team are really there fighting in their worst nightmare, the predators. The one thing that was weak, was who dropped the human team on this distant planet anyway and I saw no way they could get off in the end of the movie. So it was pretty much two wounded mercenaries limping off into the sunset for an ending.It left you hanging.Other than that I loved it.

B00406UK5A|3.0|It's AD 117.  The Roman Empire stretches from Egypt to Spain, and as far as the Black Sea.<br /><br />However, in northern Britain, the seemingly inexorable blitz has hit an unexpected wall -- the resistance of the elusive, brutal and terrifying Picts.<br />Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbinder) is the lone survivor of a Pict raid on a remote Roman fort.  He marches north with General Virilus (Dominic West) with orders to blot the Picts from the earth and kill their leader, Gorlacon.<br /><br />The legion is ambushed.  Virilus is taken prisoner.  Now behind enemy lines, Quintus must keep his ragged platoon alive.  Fighting hard weather and rough terrain, Quintus and his men are chased by the pitiless, callous Pict warriors under the command of vengeful Etain (Olga Kurylenko).<br /><br />Can the small band of soldiers reach the safety of the Roman occupied region?<br /><br />It's not too difficult to interpret this gnarly, intense action adventure in terms of western occupation, invasion or liberation (take your pick) of foreign lands.  Although I doubt there is any political intent from the writer and director<br /><br />Director Neil Marshall know what he's doing here and the energy never lets up with wonderful set pieces and terrific use of primitive, atmospheric location and sets.<br /><br />A better film than I expected but somehow less than I wished.
0596009208|4.0|I think that there is a great range of different opinions on this book, which is healthy.<br />I think that a 1 star is not fair as if you are beginning programming most books will not answer all questions - that would be difficult. And if a book did answer all questions (which they may) it may be difficult for the user (a beginner) to find the solution as they may not be aware of what they are searching for. I like the headfirst series and also like Headfirst HTML.<br /><br />I also think that for a beginner, to either programming or java (or whatever), should purchase a few books on the language and expect a few good hurdles along the way. One book, I feel, will not solve all problems and exposure to many presentations of \\"how\\" to code can only help - and this is a book I believe can indeed assist a learner attempting to crack the Java code - but more advanced programmers will be more fluent with the online libraries and the options via existing code.<br /><br />So - yes, it's a great book. So - no it will not solve all problems. But my recommendation is to pick this book up along with a could others (Walter Savitch for example) and build a library if it is really something you want to learn.<br /><br />Just a suggestion and happy coding.

B003Y58CKS|5.0|Vocally this is a superb Rigoletto. Much more so than any other still available on DVD. Juan Diego is simply perfect in his ardor. Those tenor arias familair from childhood were fresh and new. He is a treasure; I hope he does not overdo and burn out too soon. Mr Lucic's baritone is almost too pretty to be Rigoletto but he did show a gamut of emotions from tender to fury. He reminded me of my first Rigoletto, Leonard Warren. But as noted by other reviewer he was not ugly, misshapen or evil enough. He should not engender pity from the audience. Ms Damrau is an excellent singer who had no trouble with the tessitura of Gilda. My only problem is that she seemed too smart to be taken in by the Duke. My ideal Gilda would have a sweeter, more innocent voice ala Victoria de los Angeles. Even the lesser parts were sung by young excellent musicians. A great cast! I was particularly impressed by the tall sinister Sparafucile of Georg Zeppenfeld. There is a devil for a future Faust. No problems with the low notes they are all there and musical too. He has a great future. I also commend the excellent chorus and orchestra; the conductor Luisi did things just right.<br />Now the problem. Lehnhoff's production is a travesty. A crime agaist nature. Verdi knew what he wanted. He was a man of the theatre and envisioned the actions and the sets as he was writing the music. Yes you can do strange things to Handel and it works but by no means can you do such to Verdi. I now put on the DVD and just listen to it.

1439107955|5.0|As a work of scholarship, this book is just tremendous. Mukherjee traces the history of our understanding of cancer from 2500 BC to present-day. He writes of political battles for public attention, incredible wiles in the biology of the disease, and schisms among the researchers sent to conquer it. All major developments are present and sourced in sixty pages of footnotes. From this grand historical scope, Mukherjee has crafted a tight and coherent narrative that I found very difficult to put down. I'm aware of no lay account of cancer with anything approaching the level of depth present here. This book is unique.<br /><br />Like anything so vast, it isn't quite perfect. Certain structural changes would benefit fluency, though they've no impact on my recommendation.<br /><br />* More humanizing characteristics and quotations. Smaller researchers, and occasionally even key players, are summed by little more than what they've accomplished. There are perhaps a hundred contributors that Mukherjee covers, but with exception to a handful that have had tens of pages devoted to them or some peculiar eccentricity, they're interchangeable and unmemorable.<br /><br />* A more even balance between discovery and those stricken by cancer. Mukherjee is at his best when he's describing the struggles of his own patients. These stories are touching, personal, and an intensely interesting ground-level foil to the bird's eye view of much of the book. The retrospective of cancer discovery is so vast and detailed that these rare moments where the story reverts to the present can feel like an oasis.<br /><br />Roughly half of The Emperor is comprised of five and ten-page vignettes where Mukherjee poses a question (\\"If XY, then could XYZ ... ?\\") and resolves it with the travails of a researcher (\\"Person Q, a scientist at H, noticed ...\\"). These accounts are often gripping, especially as advances accelerate in the mid-1980s, but sets of four or five in a series are enough to cause my attention to drift.<br /><br />* A different ending. In the final chapters, Mukherjee suggests he'd originally intended to conclude with the death of a particular patient. By serendipity, that patient was still living in late 2009. Given the great strides in cancer survival and the sense he conveys that genetics may well provide the magic bullets that so occupied the fantasies of early researchers, concluding on a high note would have been within the spirit of the book. Instead, Mukherjee describes another patient who did in fact die. This person was not previously introduced. She was a better fit for the narrative, but including her account for that purpose didn't strike the right tone to me.<br /><br />I'd also like to have seen Mukherjee become more of a prognosticator in later chapters. There probably aren't a hundred people alive in a better position than the author to comment on the state of cancer research, to predict, or to theorize in new directions. Such insights are spare in The Emperor. Having so aptly dispensed with past and present, it left me wanting for more about the future.<br /><br />These notes aside, if you've even a tangential interest in cancer or biology, Mukherjee's opus remains a must-read.
0385523912|5.0|Looked at the cover and opened the book thinking I was going to be walking miles and miles through an ominous canvas wearing shoes of ordinary lives. I was so sure of it...when the first little light snapped on. It was the mention of Confucius, a philosopher whose quotes always made sense to me. According to the way I read the text, as it related to Confucius, I got to thinking I needed to do more reading on Confucius, and his theories, before quoting him so blindly. So instead of a coarse ordinary read, this became a vivid extraordinary read.<br /><br />All told, Mrs. Song touched me most. Her testimony is remarkable. And not that the other accounts were least exceptional... I was indebted to them all... this is an incredible account of not only the loss of 'songbun' among its citizens, but for the country in whole, however Mrs. Song largely united the accounts, shedding much light through her character and beliefs on my understanding the fundamentals behind Confucius quotes. This is clearly expressed and supported (a big thanks to the author for clarity and candor), by the lingering feelings Dr. Kim, Hyuck, Mi-ran, and presumably many others `ultimately' expressed about North Korea.<br /><br />Nothing to Envy is insightful, lucidly clear, and a jarring must read.
0316077054|5.0|I've read a couple of disappointing books lately so I was a little slow to pick up Beautiful Darkness.  Thankfully BD was a wonderful reintroduction to what's still out there to be found: lyrical, beautiful stories and writing.  Seeing this book compared to Twilight is a little sickening to me.  Twilight is a story about obsession and how parents and family don't understand and should be kept in the dark, because no one understands just how wonderful and special your love is.  Gag.  The world of The Darkness books is beautiful and different, gothic and light and charming at the same time.  I enjoy the male narrator and the deeper story of light and darkness and claiming yourself.  All in all a great sequel.  I'm not sure how I'll last another year to go back to the Southern pies and gothic folklore of Gatlin County and the Casters.
B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|The blueray version of \\"King Kong\\" is marvelous. There are a few scenes that aren't as pristine as the rest of the film, but those are short, and do not really distract from the total enjoyment. The disc contains all the extras that were with the previously released 2-disc dvd package, but some of the inserted packaged extras that were with the dvd deluxe edition (the one that came in a metal casing) were not included with the blueray edition. But for a film that is 80+ years old, the blueray version looks remarkably fresh and crisp.

When I found out that one of the girls had a passing interest in vegan foods, and a passion for cupcakes, I told her I had a book I thought she would like. I brought Vegan Cupcakes to the practice and she thumbed through the pictures with great excitement. \\"Can I borrow it, please?\\" she asked. Softee that I am, of course I said yes. That was a couple of months ago and I haven't seen the book since, but she did tell me she loved the recipes, shared them with her teammates, and is going to bring it back soon. Wink, wink. No problem. I'll just buy another one. Seriously, a great book for getting kids interested in the new (to them) world of vegan food.

B003W5C0VW|5.0|For me, Exile on Main Street is my favorite Stones album.  It has always been underplayed compared to other albums the Stones have made.  Sure it is 70's shot footage, get over it.  It captures the band at what I believe was their creative best.  Watching Mick Taylor play is worth the price alone.  Hearing them play Dead Flowers, Sweet Virginia and All Down the Line are excellent renditions of songs they rarely cover now.  Throw in the classics like Gimme Shelter, Bitch, Tumbling Dice and You Can't Always Get What You Want, see the Stones at what I consider their height of playing live. For my money, I will take the late 60's and early 70's as the best period of music ever created and catching the Stones at this time is a must. So if you are a pureist and love what the 70's stood for buy it, if you are a product of the tech generation that needs to have 50 different angles, too bad.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|In this album Rihanna has gone right back to the reason she became so world reknown and expanded on it. S&M, What's my Name, Only Girl and Cheers would make you hit the repeat button. Then you can get tired and realise they are more songs on the album and raining men and man down would make anyone fall in love with the Caribbean. They catchy lyrics and infectous bet makes u wonder if either will be a single cause it would be worth it. The other balads on the track are mode songs and LTWYL 2 and California King Bed shows us this girl can do it all. To say you can be easily bored by this album would be wrong instead they is sumthing there for everyone and i'm glad Riri mixed it up. Well Done

0385523912|5.0|\\"Nothing To Envy\\" is an outstanding piece of investigative journalism by Barbara Demick. It is built on vividly revealed true stories of former North Koreans who risked their lives and that of the families they left behind to escape the horror of their existence for a life in the so called free world (China and South Korea).     The picture of the hermit kingdom that emerges from these stories is as one would imagine, their experiences made more heartrending when we get to know these individuals, their hopes, fears and  dreams. It is without exaggeration a picture of life in a different planet - being isolated from the rest of the world, the reality and perspective of its inhabitants is defined and dictated entirely by the kingdom's despotic leadership. Hard to believe, but the nightmare existence from physical starvation and deprivation of basic human rights they endure is felt only when they begin to suspect they are being fed a diet of lies as regards how they live relative to the rest of humanity.     Demick deserves praise for her self restraint and confidence in simply allowing these stories to inform us. There is little of the sensationalism or hysteria typical of journalistic writing on a subject such as this. Having said that, it couldn't have been too difficult for Demick to keep her levelheadedness in the face of such unadulterated evil. There is no need for embellishment when the starkness of the truth speaks for itself. One of the best non-fiction books of the year.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I really wanted to like this controller, I really did.    It has the design I like, the texture is great, the control stick have a great redesign placement.  But there's some huge flaws in the design of this controller    1. YOU CANNOT POWER THE PS3 ON!! Why this is not possible I have no idea, but you cannot grab the controller walk across the room and power on your PS3.  You have to manually push the PS3 power button- Very annoying in this day and age.    2.  Moving ever so slightly from not facing the dongle will cause a re-sync to the controller.  I was playing New Vegas, and I can't count how many times my controller lost connection, and enemies killed me or got cheap shots- Really annoying.    My only pros for this controller are how it feels in the hands and also how quickly it powers on.  Sony's controller takes a few seconds of holding down the PS button before the controller powers on, this is instantaneous.    SO decision is obviously up to the buyer, but I say just splurge the extra 20$ and get the Sony controller, I'm returning my Power A today.      I appreciate the effort built into the design, but there's too many flaws that outweigh the positives IMHO.    Hope this helps everyone!
B00003CX9W|5.0|Fantasia is two hours and five minutes long and was released on November 13, 1940. Fantasia is by far the longest Disney animated movie and the only one to day is two hours long. This was Disney's third animated film and by some Disney's famous flop. Fantasia did not earn a profit till 1969 when it was released for its fourth time. Fantasia is a mixture of eight animated shorts set to music with no dialog. The only person talking in the film is Deems Taylor during the introduction of each program description. This version of Fantasia is the roadshow version which included a fifteen intermission. The only thing missing in this \\"uncut version\\" is the Sunflower character; that is a centaur depicted as an African-American girl in the Pastoral Symphony segment. Also as with the original version there is no opening and closing credits; there are closing credits in the VHS version. The eight animated shorts are:    Toccata and Fugue in D Minor  Nutcracker Suite  The Sorcerer's Apprentice  The Rite of Spring  Intermission/Meet the Soundtrack  The Pastoral Symphony  Dance of the Hours  Night on Bald Mountain/Ave Maria    One of the reasons for its failure was due to the critics; the newspaper did not know who to send to view the film. Some sent a movie critic and some sent a music critic while some newspapers sent both. The film critics loved Fantasia and the music critics hated the movie. Another reason was not all movie theaters were equipped to handle the amount of audio equipment required for the movie. Still Fantasia is an enjoyable movie to watch and gets an A+ in my book.

No book could be that good, could it? Then my resource students, who could easily contest for the spot of the most notorious non-readers, began showing me the book too. THEY caught my attention.<br /><br />\\"First of all, let me get something straight: This is a JOURNAL, not a diary.\\" So writes Greg Heffley, a twelve-year-old boy new to middle school. Diary of a Wimpy Kid is described on its cover as \\"a novel in cartoons,\\" but don't let this mislead you. The book isn't a comic strip or a graphic novel. It's an actual 200+ page story, told in diary-er, journal- format, where the illustrations have been purposely drawn as cartoons.<br /><br />Greg continues, \\"I know what it says on the cover, but when Mom went out to buy this thing, I SPECIFICALLY told her not to get the one that had diary on it.\\" Now let ME get something straight, in case you haven't already figured it out already: This is not a literature. Greg Heffley prefers sleep, pranks, hot girls, video games to reading books-of any kind. Does this sound like any boy you know? Yet devout reader of classics that I am, I liked the book enough to buy my own copy, eagerly seek out the movie, and recommend it to every boy (and even some girls) that I know--including my husband.<br /><br />In every way I can think of, Greg is NOT me. He keeps a diary only to have answers handy about his life when he's rich and famous and people are asking him questions all day long. He hates being in gifted reading, because this means a lot of extra work. He gets up on the weekend, not to watch television, but to escape his breath. He invites his best friend over to work out with homemade weights and lets him go first, simply to see if the broomstick will snap. He tries out for the part of a tree in the school play to avoid having lines and to have the opportunity to throw apples at a classmate. Is it any wonder some adult critics condemn the book for being about a selfish lazy kid?<br /><br />Yet Greg is like anyone who (like me) has been unpopular: \\"The best I can figure is that I'm somewhere around 52nd or 53rd most popular this year.\\" He is also anyone who has been the middle child, meaning your older sibling picks on you and your younger sibling gets away with everything you don't. He is anyone who has been bullied, which for him meant hiding out at his grandmother's house on Halloween night and often being assaulted by snowballs. He is also anyone whose plans have backfired. For example, thinking he can rely on the map at the back of the classroom, he doesn't study for his geography test--except then his teacher removes it at the last minute and Greg fails his test. And he is all of us who can't handle anymore stress.<br /><br />Jeff Kinney has adeptly captured the world of most boys. This is part of the appeal of the books, although not what I most admire about Kinney. After all, writing about boys should be easy for him as a former boy. What I admire most is how he can write about this kid who in one breath I kind of don't like, but in the next I can so easily identify with. He's the wimpy kid in all of us--and so, yes, a popular book can actually truly be good.les at a classmate. Is it any wonder some adult critics condemn the book for being about a selfish lazy kid?

B0000214F0|5.0|This movie, clearly for adults only ,is the only true combination of the highest quality film making, truly professional actors, sadly realistic depiction of history and the very best pornography in one movie that I know to exist. If you have any reservations about senseless violence and all manner of sexual deviance you should not see this movie. If you can get past that, to see a likely accurate depiction of a historical period, don't miss it.
0439023491|5.0|What if the well-being of your family depended on how well you could fake feelings for a guy whom you barely knew? What if your friends and neighbors could be hurt everytime you rebelled against rules that you disliked? How would you choose to act? How easily could you make those choices and face the consequences?<br /><br />Katniss may have thought her life would return to normal after the Hunger Games, an annual fight-to-the-death event demanded by the Capital of its twelve districts. Yes, of course, there would be concessions: She would serve as mentor to the next tribute picked from District 12; She and her family would live in Victor Village; And the families of those children whom she killed during the battle enforced upon her by the Capitol would not likely forget or forgive her. But then again she would probably never meet them nor the families of the children whom she had saved except of course Peeta's family. He would live in a house alongside her in the Victor Village but, now that they were done with the games, she would no longer need to feign love for him to save both their lives-or would she?<br /><br />In Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins, Katniss is bombarded by more than the harshness of District 12. Her new victor life demands more of her than her pre-victor life of boiling water for baths, disobeying hunting laws to find game to sell for food, and living under a constant layer of coal dust. After the games, Katniss finds herself mourning the loss of her earlier life-for at least then she knew where she fit in. Now she has President Snow warning her she must convince him of her love for Peeta-her family's life depends on it. One minute Katniss is wishing to gather up her family and run. The next minute she is encouraging rebellion. Only the latter results not only in the reinstitution of public whippings, but sees the beloved Hob burnt to the ground. Every action Katniss takes has a consequence, none of which are pleasant.<br /><br />Even when Katniss acquisces and revives pretense of love for Peeta, her world is not righted. How could it be? Shouldn't one marry only for love? Yet what if by marrying Peeta, she could protect her family and the man she actually loves? And who's to say she doesn't really love Peeta? Or that she truly loves Gale? She has never been allowed to explore her feelings for either without the intervention and manipulation of the Capitol. Or what if she didn't feel any conflict about her true feelings? What if she did actually love Peeta? How could even this resolution help her find peace, when she is seen as the mockingjay? She is the symbol of rebellion and hope of a new life apart from the Capitol. All over people in districts are fighting and fleeing tyrany. Would Katniss really feel comfortable choosing the safety of seclusion in Victor Village, while around her others are risking execution to overthrow the Capital? She ignited a spark when she threatened for her and Peeta to swallow poisonous berries in the arena and therefore allow for no survivors. Could she accept just sitting back?<br /><br />Catching Fire holds all the perfect qualities that Hunger Games did: suspense, characters we deeply care about, settings that are familar yet harsh and alien, and of course probing ethical questions. Actually, Collins reveals even deeper facets of the lives of her minor characters and even so-called district enemies. Catching Fire is a captivating sequel that will leave you breathless throughout and send you dashing at the end to the library for the conclusion to the Hunger Games trilogy.iss acquisces and revives pretense of love for Peeta, her world is not righted.

B0034G4OXQ|5.0|With a title like HEREAFTER, why would anyone expect non-stop action scenes?  Get a grip, you naysayers.  HEREAFTER is a spiritual film, plain and simple.  And one of the best films of the year.  Not only does it deal with life and death, but how a near-death experience changes a person.  And how other people can't understand it.  This could've been a really corny movie, but Eastwood did a fantastic job making it real and heartfelt.  Highly recommended.  And for the naysayers--stick to movies like THE UNSTOPPABLE.  That's about all your attention span can probably handle.
0439023513|2.0|I really wanted to love Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins. After all, I had raced through the first two books in The Hunger Games trilogy both times that I read them. When news of the third book hit the web, I didn't even wait for its arrival at my local library. Instead I bought the boxed trilogy at a local bookstore. I couldn't wait to find out what would happen in the newly-discovered District 13, with the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale, and to the Capitol now that its districts were staging rebellions. Yet despite winning me over by the end, this book is the weakest link.<br /><br />To start, there are large logic holes: For example, can anyone tell me how exactly did Gale pull off the rescue of District 12? If the electricity was disabled solely due to the district being bombed, how did its hundreds of citizens flee in time to the lake? And how did Gale know about the lake? Last I heard Katniss hadn't shared its location with anyone because of its held memories of her dad. Perhaps she shared its whereabouts at some point in her discreet talks with Gale, was of course overheard by all the knowing Capitol, and I have simply forgotten this moment. Even given this, why didn't the Capitol didn't simply pursue everyone to the lake in their hovercrafts?<br /><br />I do admire the careful attention Collins bestows to new readers. In both Catching Fire and Mockingjay, she spends the first few chapters deftly alluding to earlier events. In a new twist, in Mockingjay, she even portrays Katniss as mentally instable, being visited by doctors, and using their recommended technique of remembering the simplest things she knows to be true: \\"My name is Katniss Everdeen. I am seventeen years old. My home is District 12. I was in the Hunger Games. I escaped. The Capital hates me. Peeta was taking prisoner. He is thought to be dead....\\" Personally, I thought this chant-repeated more than once in the first few chapters-to be overkill, but perhaps this is merely the arrogant reaction of a fan.<br /><br />Collins also never really convinced me that former tribute and victor Finnick would have also succumbed to mental instability to the point that he rarely left his hospital bed. Yes, In Catching Fire, he did race after an imitation of his love's voice. Yet afterwards he was the one who kept Katniss from chasing an imitation of her best friend's voice. He also conspired with the allies to blow up the Hunger Games arena. Collins seemed to want to include him, without having any valid reason, and ultimately I dislike the role she gave him in the final section.<br /><br />Which brings up another flaw. I tend to prefer character books. Collins' masterful depiction of both major and minor characters is partially what drew me into her suspense books. In Mockingjay, I feel instead inundated with a dizzying array of bland characters from the newly-discovered District 13. Even when familar characters step into the scene such as Beeter, who was introduced in Catching Fire and instrumental to the escape of the allies from the death arena, very little new is revealed about them. And far too many favorite characters such as Effie and  Cinna and Madge are absent, dead, or conveniently resurrected when Collins needs them.<br /><br />Then there's the setting. I don't need the places in my novels to be visceral. After all, they're rather lacking in plenty of other books on my wish list. Yet Collins' adept delination of detail is partially what drew me into her suspense trilogy. There is a glimmer of her style in a line in the chapter about the lockdown drills, where Katniss stays behind a pipe in the laundry room and watches a spider construct a web. But it is only a glimmer, in contrast to the plentitude I found in her first two books: \\"ugly urn filled with fake flowers\\" \\"watch a beetle crawl up the side of a honeysuckle bush\\" \\"green and silver moth on his wrist\\" \\"fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders\\" \\"scent of oranges that still lingered on his chin\\" \\"feeble flame that burns on one end of a charred log\\". No doubt, her craft suffered here due to District 13 being uniform in buildings, rooms, schedules, food, and pretty much everything else you could imagine. Then again, Collins created this bland other district. Why, I am not sure.<br /><br />There were other moments besides that of the spider that I liked. There is the chapter where Haymitch challenges everyone to identify the moments when Katniss shone as a hero. There are the moments with Boggs, one of the District 13 military leaders, that endear him to Katniss and therefore to me. And there are the surprise twists such as what happened to those allies who were captured by the Capitol, what happens in District 2 when the rebels attempt to take it over, and other events that I can't mention. Actually, with those twists, the suspense and the emotional angst builds. So, with this last book, the page-turning thrills (with its fighting and killing) are sadly are mostly what engaged me. What a disappointing finale to an otherwise brillant trilogy.hat burns on one end of a charred log\\".

B001GZ6QC4|2.0|Now, I will try to be as mature as I can be about this. To start off, I like Batman. I think that it's a very good comic series with interesting themes and complex characters (for the most part). I also like Tim Burton's Batman films. I feel that they are well done representations of the series itself (though there are changes to the story, but that is expected). The Joel Schumacher films I feel are mediocre and rather uninteresting (not to mention poorly done). As for the Nolan movies, they are okay, but only okay. It seems that the majority are saying that Nolan's movies are the best movies by far. I feel that that is an untrue statement. The main reason I do not like these movies is that, unlike the Burton movies, it is altered a bit too much to where it doesn't truly feel like Batman anymore. They don't have the tone, mood, atmosphere, themes (at least not as well portrayed), or appeal as the comics and the Burton movies. They feel almost like a movie that is using Batman as a way to show it's themes and ideas rather than being being adaptations (well, at least The Dark Knight anyway). Another problem I have with this movie is the characters. Most of the cast is okay, but my main issue is with Batman and The Joker. To begin with Batman, I feel that Christian Bale is good as Bruce Wayne, but not good as Batman. When he's Batman, it feels as though he's trying too hard to be Batman to where it feels like some guy doing a bad impersonation. Michael Keaton is the best actor for Batman, as he could be both Bruce Wayne and Batman without trying too hard. Interestingly, after Keaton left, subsequent Batman movies seem to have an actor for the part of Wayne/Batman who is good as Wayne, but not good as Batman (Val Kilmer, George Clooney, and Christian Bale). Odd, isn't it? As for The Joker, Ledger pales in comparison to Nicholson. The Joker is a villain who is comedic and insane. He uses several kinds of devices, substances, and plans to make everybody smile, then die from laughter (as well as other criminal reasons). Ledger's Joker didn't feel like the Joker. He felt like a cross between a watered-down Hannibal Lecter and Michael Myers (in other words a plotting sociopath that kills without feeling). The problem with this character is that he has no style, no comedy, and no feelings. The Joker always kills people in sick and twisted ways for fun, which sometimes feels oddly amusing, and he can feel angry and sad at times (though his insane joy is most prominent). This Joker only gets the insane part right. It ironic how Caesar Romero did an overly goofy and comedic Joker, Ledger did an homicidal and insane Joker, but only Nicholson did the true Joker. Nicholson was able to portray both elements of the Joker beautifully. As for the plot, it was okay, but undeservingly long. Some movies should be rather long because the story calls for it (eg. films by Akira Kurosawa), but this movie was not one of them. Overall, the Nolan movies are okay, but definitely not as good as people say they are. I hope that my review has been helpful to anyone and that I didn't offend anyone too much. Thank you for your time.
0439023521|5.0|What is it about Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins that enthralls me so much? My husband teases that it's all the fighting and the killing. He is right that the book is driven by violence. It is also driven by suspense. Which means in either case, it's not my typical book. I prefer character books; where there is more than action to the story. Hunger Games however is that special hybrid that offers mind-bending and heart-wracking thrills, while also offering up characters to love, settings to absorb, and enough emotional angst and moral probing to leave one slightly unsettled when the book covers are shut.<br /><br />Collins reveals much of the depth of her main character Katniss through the memories she relives of family, friends, and neighbors while competing for her life against eleven other selected tributes in the Capitol's arena of death. Even before being plunged into this nightmare, however, we first see Katniss seek the warm comfort of her sister, anticipate the comfortable presence of best friend Gale, swing by the Hob (a black market) which remains busy even on Reaping Day, and struggling to accept help from her mother. In other words, in just one chapter, Collins successfully presents Katniss as a vulnerable and flawed but likeable character. Then in the very next, her sister's name is called as a tribute, Katniss volunteers to take her place, and the countdown to the Hunger Games begins. Yet Collins continues to delve deeply into her characters, like a miner burrowing deeper and deeper into the earth, even as the action switches from District 12 to the Capitol and to the Hunger Games arena.<br /><br />While I also do not particularly gravitate to books about other worlds, setting can enhance a book for me in the same way that large screens and high definition video can enhance the movie-viewing experience. Collins has delineated details so well that her hauntingly medieval but also starkly futuristic setting feels alarmingly real. Each district in her country of Panem lives by a trade, in District 12 children grow up to be coal miners, and suffers from the effects of war. All districts are separated from one another, surrounded by electric fences, and often guarded by Peacekeepers who punish law-breakers with whippings, gallows, or gunfire. Even worse, the Capitol annually requires each district to enter names of children into a drawing, from which one youth per district is picked to compete in the Hunger Games, from which there is allowed to only a single survivor. In ancient times maidens were sacrificed to appease monsters or gods; in Panem, children are thrown into an arena where environmental features such as manufactured wild birds and beasts are dreamt up by the Gamekeepers of the Capitol.<br /><br />I could rave further about all the positives of Hunger Games. There is Collins' style: \\"As I stride to the elevator, I fling my bow to one side and quiver to the other ... brush past the Avoxes who guard the elevators and hit the number twelve....\\" Teachers would definitely praise Collins for her use of WOW words! There is also the thematic undertone: Consider Peeta's declaration that in the arena: \\"I want to die as myself.\\" His stirring words causes a quarrel between him and Katniss that reminds of the varied reactions of contestants on reality shows. Truly Hunger Games holds so many qualities so perfectly blended together that it needs to be your next read.ves by a trade, in District 12 children grow up to be coal miners, and suffers from the effects of war.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Harry Potter and The Deathly hallows Part 1 was dark, it was scary, and gave the viewer a ride into the darkening world of Harry Potter, and for that it stand out (in my option) one the best Potter films yet. Simply put. Bravo! can't wait for part 2.
B002HWRYJE|1.0|I am going to spare everyone a summary of the plot and cut to the chase: while this movie was entertaining with a handsome cast and flashy scenes, it was not Star Trek.. If you had named it, let's say \\"Space Academy - the Early Years\\" it would be pretty ok but naming it Star Trek is sort of like throwing a bucket of acrylic paint at the Mona Lisa and calling it art. If you dont know much about Star Trek and dont care too much about internal consistency in a movie in general, character development, plausibility or a plot for that matter, then this is the movie for you. As a matter of fact I believe that one of the reasons this movie has proven to be very popular among non-Star Trek fans is because it is not Star Trek!! It is a glossy reboot of the original with little substance beneath its action-packed surface and pretty faces, resembling more an MTV video. Here are some of the more serious issues with this movie:<br /><br />+ All of the \\"acting\\" is 'over the top' and everyone is exaggerated, to the point of clownish buffonery. Kirk (or Chris Pine really) appears to have ADD or something and he is arrogant, cocky, erratic, tactless and obnoxious. I was so annoyed early on with him already that I actually enjoyed watching him being beaten up at the bar. A cutsey boy cadet who walks on a bridge and says, \\"I'm in charge\\". You have got to be kidding me. Not only that but an Admiral placing him as second in command of a ship? Wow.<br /><br />+ Lightning fast cuts from one scene to another like an MTV video and really poor plot where all the Enterprise crew just happen to find themselves together even though their entire respective pasts have been inexorably changed? Ridiculous.<br /><br />+ The back stories behind how the original characters met was insulting and every tagline from the original series was used most inappropriately, as if they had a list of lines required to be used so that they could show at least some resemblance to the original show. Instead of spending time on developing each character, such as Spock's inner struggle and Kirk fighting his demons and finally turning from a repeat offender to a serious and devoted Starfleet officer, they forwarded (literally) all that to focus more on CGI effects and visuals.<br /><br />+ Speaking of visuals: The interior of the Enterprise looks like a Bloomingdale's make-up counter. How ridiculous and untrue to even an altered timeline was that? The interior of ships in the 24th century didnt look this chic.<br /><br />+ The villain was uninspired and dumb. Seriously. I mean here you got this Romulan (who doesn't even remotely look Romulan by the way and has super strength) who saw his entire planet be destroyed by a \\"galaxy threatening supernova\\" (!). Then, he is flung 200 years into the past, with a tub of super future material and nothing to do. Now, what would you do in this situation? If it were me, I might, oh, I don't know, WARN MY CIVILIZATION. Given 200 years of lead time, an evacuation would not be all that difficult. OK, let's say I'm a little bit crazy. What might I do then? Nero says he wants to create a world in which Romulus exists without the Federation. What might be the best way of achieving this? I might, oh, I don't know, GO TO ROMULUS, give them all this fantastic future technology, and become emperor of a civilization 200 years in advance of everyone else out there. What does Nero actually do? He goes it alone. Because, you know, shut up, that's why. He then decides to obliterate _an entire planet_ based on said faulty intelligence and wait 25 freaking years for Spock to show up so he can exact revenge. He then also just so happens to maroon Spock on a planet that just so happens to have a Starfleet base on it where he can oh so conveniently run into the new Kirk and inform him that it just so happens that his and new Spock's destiny is to be friends at all costs apparently. How so very inconvenient. Yup, that's the villain. There is no passion, no substance, no character, apparently also no intelligence behind his person and motive other than what was written in the script for him to act like.<br /><br />+ The product placement was so obvious. Way to promote an enlightened future in which all of human kinds' ills coming from money and economic deprivation have been eradicated - by having something like 20 millions worth of product placement in there.<br /><br />+ Bones: The reason for why McCoy says he is called \\"bones\\" was totally pulled out of the writers' butts in this movie. The expression comes from civil war time doctors who had to use saws to amputate legs. The term \\"bones\\" (which Kirk called McCoy in The Original Series) comes from that. In this stupid movie McCoy says \\"in a divorce my wife got everything and left me dry to my BONES\\" and they use that to explain why Kirk calls him \\"bones\\". Ridiculous.<br /><br />+ If this is a future in which money has been eradicated (and lawyers executed), how can McCoy _lose_ everything he has in a divorce and be left \\"dry to his bones\\"?<br /><br />+ The Star Trek series, especially Star Trek: The Next Generation, brought in top scientific minds to advise about what is and is not science and how they can take an idea and transform it such that, even though it is science-fiction, it is still scientifically consistent and coherent.  This movie spent a lot of time on special effects, flashy scenes and catchy one-liners but very little on rationalizing the science and incorporating it intelligently into the movie to create consistency. They dumbed the whole premise down to a grade school level and some of the things they are trying to pass as \\"science\\" would make the head of any Star Trek regular writer spin in disbelief. That's what happens though when you set out to deliver bread and circuses to the masses. Ships flying through Black Holes and coming out the other side intact? Enterprise escapes the black hole by blowing up the warp core inside of it? Ski diving onto a platform FROM SPACE? A mining ship annihilating an entire planet?<br /><br />+ The writers seemed to be thinking  that simply because this is science fiction, any kind of implausible garbage they come up with goes. Sci-fi doesnt equal magic though and the one thing Star Trek didnt rely on was magic bullets to explain phenomena and anomalies etc. In this movie, the most absurd stuff goes down and we are to believe it makes sense because the genre is sci-fi and the writers say so? How stupid do they actually think people are?<br /><br />+ This movie is not true to Star Trek in even a rudimentary way. It is not intelligent, or thought provoking. It is not about space exploration and asking the tough questions, there is no ttempt at science, philosophy. Nothing. This is Star Trek the way only a product of the over-stimulated times we live in could make it. Cheeky, sexy, and dumb.<br /><br />+ Speaking of inconsistency: Spock's and Kirk's relationship in this movie is adversarial from the start and all they do is argue and fight and at some point Spock is juts about to strangle Kirk. Yet in the end, somehow out of the blue, they become good friends, because the old Spock says they were in another life. That is completely inconsistent with how the characters have behaved and been portrayed throughout the movie as you cannot just push the button and say \\"hey, I am good friends with you now\\". That is just bad writing folks. If you cant even get something like character consistency within a plot right, you are a lousy writer. How Orci and Kurtzman are still with a job and get to write the sequels is truly beyond me.<br /><br />+ Kirk's  promotion: how does a cadet go from being suspended for cheating to becoming the captain of one of Starfleet's most prestigious spaceships less than a week later? Yes he saved Earth, but come on. That scene where he is decorated as the second coming of Zefram Cochrane, by the same man who just a few days ago held the hearing on his cheating ways, was ridiculous. A cadet getting full command of a flagship while his instructor, in whose class he cheated and was caught, gets to serve under him as second in command? Laughable...if I was Spock, Vulcan stoicism or not, I would have taken the matter to Starfleet command.<br /><br />+ McCoy's character played by Karl Urban seemed too old and sophisticated to be a Starfleet cadet, especially among this group of immature rascals. He seemed to be the only adult amidst this circus where a child (Kirk) was getting to play captain or something. Even though Urban did a fantastic job playing McCoy, they should have cast him either next to a more mature cast of Kirks and Spocks or cast him as an admiral or something. He really was the only one who wasnt out of his mind.<br /><br />+ More than 600 episodes from Star Trek: The Original Series, The Next Generation, Deep Space 9, and Voyager are all rendered invalid, because a couple of writers, who I must mention  have never even written a Star Trek episode before, had so little creative talent that their best idea was Well, why dont we just change the whole time-line, then we dont have to worry about established details and accurate characterizations. I am sure it's a good way for the writers and producers to turn a fast buck but Star Trek is part of pop culture. The continuity so lovingly and painstakingly preserved by all the movies, TV series and novels subsequent to the The Original Series has been destroyed with this movie. You dont have to be a Trek geek to find that outrageous.<br /><br />+ It is sad to know that the last time I, or anyone of us, will probably EVER see Leonard Nimoy do the Vulcan salute is in this nasty piece of tourist trinket!<br /><br />Bottom line: Somehow it all felt very untrue to the essence of Star Trek. It was too Hollywood and glammy and very little story and depth. If you like bling and lots of mind-less action and nail-biting sequences and good looking, hollow characters having music-video length \\"dialogs\\" with each other while flashing their handsomeness in front of smooth, shiny surfaces and catchy shots,  then this is the movie for you. But if you expect substance, drama, depth, coherence and plausibility, then you are in the wrong place. They had a lot of potential with this one but they just missed it. Since they were going to make sequels, they should have spent more time truly developing the characters and their relationships with one another and just the beginnings of their journey rather than rushing through that part and getting into some mind-less, pointless, absurd plot involving an insane yet at the same time comical Frankenstein's Romulan monster. They just missed all that and it felt rushed. The creative angle was missing and you could literally see dollar signs hanging from every cgi shot. Open up a spot for Jackie Chan, 20 ninjas and Lindsey Lohan in the sequel and the abomination will be complete.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This sharpener enabled me to make my swords sharper than I already had them relatively easily. Before this sharpener i would sharpen my swords with an accusharp sharpener and for practice I would cut cardboard boxes with them at the pizza restaurant I work at. With this sharpener I got an $8 sword to cut boxes effortlessly. I don't even feel the impact anymore. After swinging, the box will still be standing, except that it is cut in half. Its also very useful for sharpening serrated edges. The only downside is that when sharpening a larger knife or sword, it is hard to keep hold since it is so small, but that small size means I always keep it in my pocket with me.

1400052173|5.0|It's a pertinent question: how would you feel if a little bit of your tissue was removed and utilized without your knowledge? Would your answer be different depending upon how much it was used? In other words, would your opinion change if that \\"questionable\\" mole you had removed was biopsied, and afterward, the lab used your cells for a few other tests not related to your health?<br /><br />What if that same biopsied tissue ended up being cultured and sold over and over again --and an entire industry was developed based upon your cells?<br /><br />What if those cells belonged to your mother?<br /><br />In 1951, at just 31 years of age, Henrietta Lacks succumbed to a particularly aggressive form of cervical cancer. As an African-American woman, it's debatable whether or not she received the same treatment that a Caucasian person would have been entitled to at the time. There is no question that she was only permitted to be in the \\"Negro\\" ward of the hospital. But she did receive treatment. Surgery. Radiation therapy. And as a standard course of her treatment, some of her cancer cells were removed for testing.<br /><br />As it happens, a part of this sample ended up in the hands of Dr. George Gey, who for years had been attempting to culture an \\"immortal\\" cell line... a culture of human tissue that would not die. Gey's motives were pure --he really was not doing this for financial gain, or fame-- his sole interest was to help find a cure for terrible diseases; particularly cancer. It's a testament to Gey's determination that for years, ALL of the cell cultures that he worked on died out in fairly short order.<br /><br />Until Henrietta's, that is. Her cell culture --labeled \\"HeLA\\" after the first two letters of her first and last name (which was the standard practice at the time)-- did not die. In fact, her cells grew, thrived, and reproduced, soon outgrowing the container they had been placed in. Some were removed to another container, and these continued to thrive. Gey announced to other researchers that he finally had what appeared to be an \\"immortal\\" cell line and offered samples to them for research.<br /><br />An incredible amount of research. As Skloot notes in her book, shortly prior to the publication date some 58 years after Lacks' death, about 60,000 scientific papers had been written that utilized the HeLa cells for research. And the pace was not letting up... scientists the world over were still publishing nearly 4000 papers each year relating to the HeLa cells.<br /><br />As it happens, Henrietta's family had no clue that ANY of this was going on. While they may have been dimly aware that a sample of her tissue was tested before she passed away, they had no knowledge of the development of the cell line and the subsequent use of Henrietta's cells in research ranging from cancer studies, to being shot into space, to being detonated in nuclear bombs. Furthermore, many years later, when they did discover what had been happening, they really didn't have a firm grasp on what it meant.<br /><br />These were very poor people with very little education. As far as some of them were concerned, it was their MOTHER who was being endlessly prodded, poked, sliced... and sent into space and blown to bits with nuclear weapons. They were terrified that Henrietta was not only being subjected to all of these terrors --but that she could FEEL them.<br /><br />And then there was the issue of money. They may not have been highly-educated, but the family certainly wasn't stupid. Once they learned what happened, more than a few members of her family put two and two together and realized that Henrietta's cells were at the core of many millions of dollars worth of research. It's understandable that they felt entitled to a portion of it (even if there was no legal obligation on anyone's part to reimburse the family in any way.<br /><br />The bitter irony that was not lost on any of them was that a \\"part\\" of their mother (wife, aunt, etc.) wasbeing used the world over for medical research, but few of them could afford the luxury of an annual physical.<br /><br />Skloot became part of the story in the years she spent with Henrietta's daughter Deborah, (who was barely a year old when her mother died), as they traveled and dug up bits of pieces of Henrietta's past, compiling the details of Henrietta's life story that would otherwise have been lost forever.<br /><br />It's an extraordinary, and very moving story, in an incredibly well-written book. Highly recommended!<br /><br />-Jonathan Sabinthe luxury of an annual physical.

B00140PK6O|5.0|What a surprise this film was.  I found it at the library and decided to give it a try.  Normally I watch American classics from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.  My wife and I watched Cranford together and just could not get enough.  The script is perfection, the set decoration is superb, the acting top notch and the music score is well done.  Like some of the others commented; the only disappointment was that it was only five hours long! I definitely could have watched more episodes had they stretched this out. Beautifully acted, filmed, and scored. The entire production was thoroughly enjoyable and wholesome, albeit a little gruesome at some points for young children.  The only thing I didn't like is the name of the village; 'Cranford'.  The village name makes it sound like a clunky American soap opera - which it is not.  The writing is just superb, the cast and acting even better.  It is hard to say who my favorite character was, but easy to pick the best actor.... the little boy (son of the poacher)who was taught at the manor was exceptionally brilliant - as are all the others.  Not a lemon in the bunch!  I was disappointed each time credits began to roll signafying the end of an episode.  I just did not want this to end.  By the way, use the captions if you have a hard time understanding any of the heavier British accents as I occasionally did.  Clears things right up.  I can't wait for some time to pass so that I can watch this series again in freshness someday, (I often watch good movies as many as 20 or more times; e.g. Key Largo, etc.).
B003ITZBW2|5.0|The storyline cast and everything about this movie is fantastic. This is probably the best one I have seen to date. The character performance of the Joker was probably the most impressive and Jensen Ackles/Red Hood performance was also very well done. Overall this is an excellent movie.
B003L20ICE|2.0|Short Attention Span Summary (warning, plot spoilers!):<br /><br />1. We have a lesbian couple that are some years into a marriage and are raising two children together and have the boring sex life of married couples. (It's not established who was who's child).<br />2. When one of the children is 18 years old, she decides to look up the sperm donor.<br />3. We meet the sperm donor, and see that he is a guy who has no problem getting women (he has a HOT girlfriend who is about 20 years younger than he is).<br />4. Through a series of blurry steps, the sperm donor ends up in bed with the younger of the two women. They spend a lot of time acting like two little bunny rabbits (Neither of the women was identified as bisexual, nor was the issue solved.)<br />5. The older woman finds the hair of her wife in the bathroom of the sperm donor and surmises that they are having an affair.<br />6. At some point, the sperm donor (Paul was his name, I believe) decides that he wants a family and that he should latch onto this one. (This is in spite of having a much younger, much hotter girlfriend with whom he would have a lot more fun starting a family.)<br />7. The remainder (about 20 minutes) is taken up with the resolution of SOME of the conflicts in the film. Ultimately the older partner tells Paul that he needs to find his own family and that he is just an interloper. We don't hear anything from him again.<br /><br />Lots of weird things in this film.<br /><br />1. Julianne Moore is not the best looking woman. It is really hard to believe that this guy (who was shown to be so attractive to women) would pass over so many other younger, fertile women to chase after a woman that was nearly on the wrong side of menopause to try to expropriate some children that were not his. I am not sure if this was poor writing (the implausibility of the situation as it came across on the screen) or just poor casting (i.e, I might have found the relationship more plausible if Paul's love interest was not played by the hideously unattractive Julianne Moore).<br /><br />2. Lots of things just came out of nowhere. The daughter turned into an angry/ rebellious teen about halfway through the movie. Huh?<br /><br />3. Too many things were left unresolved. Was the younger wife a closet bisexual? What was wrong in the marriage of the two women that made it such that one of partners had to go outside of the marriage? What happened with the friend of the son (Laser) who obviously had some mental problems? Weren't we shown enough weird things to be led to believe that this boy's obvious mental illness would lead to some event that would support the thin plot.<br /><br />4. Political agenda overkill. Ok, so all the people who were heterosexual in the film had something wrong with them. First scene in the movie, the young kid who has been snorting dope in his father's house gets wrestled to the ground by his father and told to take it somewhere else. This is in contrast to the Perfect Lesbian Household. Then, the illicit relationship has to be between a man and a woman, but the traditional and morally proper (=in the context of the stable house) has to be between two lesbians. Then, when a character expresses interest in someone of the opposite sex, she has to be a nyphomaniac/ slut. When the daughter is emotionally damaged by her mother's affair, she goes after a man *Yawn*. *(We got the point. Straight=bad. Gay=good.)<br /><br />5. Lots of pointless, raunchy sex scenes.

0804836272|5.0|It is very hard to find a book in English about the Shinsengumi. This book has a lot of information about them that can not be found elsewhere. This book uses all the original Japanese names for things and people. For example the \\"Shogun\\" are refereed to as \\"Bakufu\\" which is what they are called in Japanese. I always thought that \\"Shogun\\" was a Japanese word, but it is not.   I needed a book to reference for my Japanese culture class paper and this book was perfect for it.

0757302661|5.0|I used the Hypnobirthing method for delivery of all three of my children. I was able to have natural, medication free births with all of them. I attended a series of about 4 classes with a Hypnobirthing instructor during my first pregnancy. I was able to remember what to do with the next two. My own experience with the method itself is that it did indeed allow me to have completely pain free moments during all of my labors. With my first, I was having a hard time getting into a relaxed state of mind because of all of the 'interventions' that the hospital felt the need to put me through (band on my belly to track contractions, IV, constant questions, etc). After enduring a long, painful back labor, I told myself that I would try it one more time. My hubby read me a script or two, and I found myself drifting off into la-la-land. I had really bad back labor, but when I went into my Hypnobirthing 'state', I felt NOT ONE SINGLE PAIN. I felt NOTHING. I was only 4 cm dilated at that point. My midwife thought I was asleep and was going to send everyone home. I was like that for a an hour or so, before I 'woke up' and felt a different sensation. I was fully dilated and in the pushing stage. So for me, that pain free moment was CRUCIAL to get me to relax, fully dilate and for my baby to turn from sunny side up. I was in so much pain BEFORE I was able to successfully concentrate on my relaxation techniques.     With my second one, I did the technique at home and again felt NOTHING for my entire labor, until I felt a POP and went to use the bathroom. I felt the urge to push and immediately went to the hospital. My daughter was born after I had been in my hospital room for exactly 7 minutes. She was almost born en route to the hospital!    With my third one, again I labored at home successfully with the technique until my water broke. I was scared that I might not make it to the hospital in time! At the hospital, I fell victim to the belly strap again, room chatter, and constant'monitoring', which did not allow me to ever get into my relaxed state. I experienced the WORST pain with this one for almost 4 hours. Again, a sunny side up who eventually turned, but to feel that turning was EXCRUCIATING!!!!    I'm pregnant with #4 and will absolutely use Hypnobirthing for this one. The key is to stay at home (or wherever you are allowed to relax completely) for as long as possible, to avoid the constant interruptions that hospitals may cause. The book is a great refresher for me. But I would STRONGLY recommend that women seek a Hypnobirthing Instructor to learn the techniques one on one, as opposed to trying to learn them from a book. And YES, it can, and has been for me, a PAIN FREE experience, as long as you are not interrupted while trying to relax. Happy Laboring!!!

B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Ok we get the premise that Kid Rock has mellowed out.  So what is the big surprise?  To the reviewers who express great  disappointment at this new album.....Have they listened to all of his previous albums? They all have songs like this on them so I just don't see why this album is such a shock.  This just happens to be the point where he finally goes strictly country/rock and does not include any hard rock or rap-style songs.  There is currently a 30 minute TV special running on CMT which shows him preparing for the new album & tour, and at one point he says \\"that train done left the station,\\" referring to the whole rap/rock genre.  He is totally right.<br /><br />So once that is established it simply comes down to whether he has produced good songs or not, and yes he has.  To all those people complaining that this isn't the \\"old\\" Kid Rock, get over it, this is in no way a sell-out but a representation of what Kid Rock always has been.  The song Care is an excellent song by any standard, (and very similar to Amen off his last album I might add).  The only song I really really don't like is Collide which is just a bit too soft/rock, but all the others are good quality mid-tempo country/blues rockers.  It truly is an album you can start at the beginning and just play through, every song is pretty good.  I am happy with it and with the direction Kid Rock is heading.

B001IBIHQ4|2.0|Have seen this series twice now.  Twice only because I wanted to give it a second chance.      Unlike Band of Brothers, it was extremely hard to care for any of the characters, or should I say caricatures?  And yes, racial antipathy played a role in the Pacific War, but on both sides.  Even today the Japanese are very racially-oriented (we would call them racists but that seems to be a term reserved exclusively for white, male, Americans).    The utter lack of context was disturbing.  The brutality and atrocities displayed by Marines was NOT as widespread as the series implies and gave scant credence to the widespread and well-known actions of the Japanese on American captives, POW's, and civilian populations (the \\"Rape of Nanking\\", anyone?).      Hanks and Spielberg played to the Hollywood crowd in this series and left the rest of us to wonder why we watched it.      I wish there were such a thing as a \\"do-over\\" for this series.  The Marines deserved better than what Hanks and Spielberg gave them.    Save your money.  Buy the book by Ambrose and the Marines who were really there and not \\"on location\\".
B00428CPUY|2.0|If you're wondering, it's not as good as the 'blow the doors off' Guitarfest 2007 DVD.     Remember, that disk had John Mayer, Los Lobos, Jeff Beck, and Clapton with Winwood and Buddy Guy all on disk 2.  All the performances just STUNG!  Some good stuff on Disk 1, as well.    This time around, the treats on are disk 1.   A very pleasing, well-photographed performance by ZZ Top inspired me to buy 'ZZ Top Live From Texas,' which I knew wasn't going to be as good -- and wasn't.  And John Mayer -- what is it about that guy?  He offers us 'Who Did You Think I Was,' a take on Joe Walsh's 'Funk 49,' the same song played sideways and MAKES IT WORK.   IMHO, it's far better than the other performances -- and fittingly ends the first disk.  I'm not saying that objectively, but Mayer does seem to have something other players don't.    Disk Two has the Ron Wood (world's most underrated guitar slinger), Buddy Guy, and umm, some other cat) on 'Five Long Years.'   Annnnnd that's about it.  'Who Shot the Sherrif?' Who cares?  I saw Eric do that on the Clapton/Beck Tour -- go watch it on You Tube, it's a better performance.    Funny but true:  you can find better guitar players than any of these guys tripping down the stairs of any NYC club.  Why put these guys on big-time film?    And the whole idea of just forcing good players to share a stage is lame.  Bonnamassa should have had his own set.

B0031RAOVY|5.0|Get out the tissues, you're gonna need it!  Excellent movie, Gere is great, the dog magnificent and the supporting cast was well chosen. Joan Allen would not have been my choice for his wife, but she grows on you as the story progresses and she redeems herself when she encounters Hachi after having been away for a number of years. It is very touching. Gere's professor colleague/friend was a great choice and lent some much needed Japanese history & background to the tale. Jason Alexander was the least sympathetic character but overcame his schmuck role with some dignity near the end.     Every child should see this movie for it character lessons and portrayal of undying love, as well as for its historical reference. It's on my list as Christmas gifts for the hard-to-buy friends. Enjoy again & again!
0307474712|5.0|I love this book and know that it will linger with me for a very, very long time.The attention to detail is seamless and real.  My heart is aching.  The characters are all so real and vibrant, but it happens in such a way that it doesn't feel as if the author has to force the back story in any way.  You simply meet the character and know them.  This book felt like real life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a book I never would have discovered had a friend not given it to me with a \\"you HAVE to read this.\\"  Yes, the entire premise of the book is brutal, so some people will be too upset to enjoy it.  I found the book very well paced and exciting to read.  I rarely read a book in under two months, I read all three books in this series in under two weeks.  I simply could not put them down.  I've given my copy to two other people and both have had the same \\"I've got to read them all\\" experience.  I can't pinpoint the type of person who will enjoy this book, but I know that I did and everyone I've given it to has.  Don't let the fact that it's a \\"teen\\" book deter you, this is a really good read.

B003PIUC02|5.0|The series, Spartacus, is an amazingly well done series on a scale which rivals cinema. The fearless creators wove a story that embraced art, the human body, and the human  spirit with disregard to censorship and modesty. In Spartacus, you will see characters who embody every aspect of human nature from greed, hate, rivalry, to love, honor and ambition. Each character has their own mental and physical toolkits and they often progress through the use of wits, cunning and even trickery. In many ways, Spartacus is an analog for our modern world where everybody has an agenda, but it is set in a time where the cultural norms were more open and extreme - where nudity, orgies, festivals, and the worship of a pantheon of gods was considered acceptable.    As a piece of artwork, Spartacus is supreme, but should not be taken as a historical account. The story is a modern day creation which is based on what we do know about Spartacus, but the problem is that we really don't know very much about Spartacus before he became a gladiator. Many aspects of Spartacus' life are subject to scholarly speculation, and this series is largely a piece of fiction. Eventhough the names of characters are often those of actual historical people, little is actually known about their personal lives. That said, Starz needed to make a television show, and in order to do that, they had to fill in the gaps.    I don't believe anyone, with an appreciation of cinema, drama or art would be disappointed with this purchase, however, one must caution against watching it with the little ones. It is clearly intended for a mature, adult audience. (Not all adults are mature.)    Much to the disappointment of its fans, Spartacus' main star fell ill to cancer, and it is not known whether or not they will ever finish where they left off. On the plus side, the cast will be returning in a prequel.

B000SMWUPS|5.0|I bought this to use with my Baby Jogger City Mini that doesn't have any sort of cup holder or parent compartment. When I was looking at a parent compartment to add, I really didn't want to spend a whole lot of money, and didn't like the cost/design of the parent console sold by Baby Jogger so I bought this one. My one and only hesitation in buying this was that it attaches by velcro and we all know that velcro can fail over time. I have not had this problem with this at all. I put this on my Baby Jogger City Mini when it came in, and have removed it several times to use on a Graco Mosaic stroller. The velcro is awesome and I've never worried about it coming off either stroller. I just wrapped it tightly around, and it's snug as can be. I use the \\"buggy buddy\\" all the time for drinks of all sizes, keys, little toys, etc. Works great and will buy another one if I ever need more than the one I have now.
B003G94BZC|5.0|I've stopped trying to figure out what makes this show so appealing.  It's the only TV production I would care to buy and Amazon's Video-on-Demand option is terrific.  While it is a compressed format, the playback on my HP DV6 series laptop is very good.  Amazon keeps track of your account and would presume that if one suffers a fatal crash, the purchase can be recovered on a replacement.<br /><br />As for the show?  Season 5 grows on you, which is one of the reasons why I purchased the VOD series.  I just had to go back and see what I missed in the beginning of this cleverly crafted season long story line.  It took some of us 'Who-bees' a few episodes to adjust to the 'new' Doctor following a brilliant 3-season run by David Tennant under Russell Davies. Now guided by Steven Moffat, Matt Smith and Karen Gillan have done a stellar job of story telling that helps this series just get better and better.<br /><br />Try the VOD option ... and take \\"Doctor Who\\" with you no matter where you go in time or space.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|I really like this show. Yeah, it may be a little corny but its got a uniqueness and style that makes it stand out from all of the other garbage that's on TV these days. The first season was pretty good but both the acting and the writing was a little flaky, but that can be expected from a brand new show. The second season has really improved by leaps and bounds with both acting and writing. I'm finding myself developing an unhealthy obsession with Cara. I really hope they produce a 3rd season and this show doesn't end up as another Firefly.
6302518423|3.0|Because video productions of Shakespeare's The Tempest are, so far, few and not very good, this is of interest. Shakespeare's words are little tampered with, but clothed (or rather, unclothed) in an overabundant context of nudity by scores of sometimes not very attractive bit player apparently representing the spirits under Prospero's control. The costumes worn by the named characters overcompensate by being so absurdly extreme (ruffs the size of trampolines) as to distract from the words and action. The 1612 text of course does have a strong aspect of pageant in its masque elements, but here the bizarre overwhelms.      The conceit of imagining what sorts of book Prospero might have had in his library is of interest, and the pages glimpsed from each volume are convincingly realistic as 17th century books, but the thematic integration of this extra layer with the production as a whole is only partially successful.       Sir John Gielgud, here in his last film, carries the role of Prospero remarkably well considering the circumsances.
0061122416|2.0|and trite is how I personally found this. Even though it is not a very long book at times I found it heavy going. There were some bits & pieces that I liked but not nearly enough. As you can tell this is not my cup of tea. You might want to read the blurb/summary of the book before you make your decision.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|This is an AWESOME toy/prop to have! It looks and sounds just like the one from the show. The only negative thing I have to say is that when mine came in the mail, the batteries were dead. Fortunately, I had 3 extra LR44 batteries lying around, so I was able to use it right out of the box. Other than that, BRILLIANT!!!!
0743487486|5.0|I've been meaning to read this book for quite awhile, and finally got around to checking it out at the library last week.  On the front cover it says, \\"A provocative challenge to the conventional wisdom about discipline,\\" and that is certainly true.  In the first few chapters, he discusses what he calls \\"conditional parenting.\\"  The premise of the book is that kids need to feel that they are loved unconditionally.  This is not the same thing as their parents loving them unconditionally; most parents believe that they do that.  The child has to not only BE loved unconditionally, but FEEL loved unconditionally.  Mr. Kohn is opposed to punishment as a form of discipline, suggesting that parents instead look at circumstances where traditional parents punish as an opportunity to work towards solving the problem *with* the child, rather than doing something *to* the child.  He looks at one very popular form of punishment these days: the time-out.  The way this is often done, he says, is a form of love withdrawal.  \\"You do something I don't like, and I isolate you until you conform.\\"<br /><br />What may be even harder to wrap your mind around is that when it comes to unconditional parenting, praise is just the other side of the punishment coin.  He says that praise implies that we approve of our children more when they behave in ways we like, and that they begin doing things in order to get praise, rather than because they're the right things to do.  Both praise and punishment create feelings of insecurity and self-centeredness, and everything becomes about what will be done to them or for them if they do x, y, or z.  He also looks at how we define \\"success.\\"  And most importantly, he talks about long-term goals.  What do we want for our children in the long term?  We want them to be happy, confident, independent, successful (whatever that may mean for us).  But the things we do in the short term are often designed to elicit a specific behavior - usually, compliance to our demands.<br /><br />Once he finished discussing the problems with punishment and praise in parenting (often citing research and the opinions of professionals), he goes on to discuss the principles of unconditional parenting.  These are:<br /><br />Be reflective.<br />Reconsider your requests.<br />Keep your eye on your long-term goals.<br />Put the relationship first.<br />Change how you see, not just how you act.<br />Respect.<br />Be authentic.<br />Talk less, ask more.<br />Keep their ages in mind.<br />Attribute to children the best possible motive consistent with the facts.<br />Don't stick to your no's unnecessarily.<br />Don't be rigid.<br />Don't be in a hurry.<br />The only problem I see with this book is only that most parents won't read it.  We've come a little way in how we view children, but we still have a long way to go, and most parents have traditional principles of parenting too deeply ingrained to consider an approach where a child gets more autonomy, more freedom, more power in his own life.  Another probable reason this book is not more popular among parents is that there is no easy fix.  There isn't a list of canned responses you can make to your child to get him to act the way you want.  There are no formulas.  The book is about knowing your child, respecting him, communicating with him in an honest and age-appropriate way.<br /><br />I see this as a book that sets aside what we've been told over the years, and lays out what we should have known instinctively, with our own common sense.  It's analogous to birth, where once we begin to look at the research and use our common sense regarding procedures and interventions, we see that everything we were raised to believe about birth is wrong.

B002ZG981E|5.0|An intelligent action film?! No! Action films are suppose to be stupid with giant robots! How dare Christopher Nolan make a film with a smart story, intresting characters and real plot. I for one am outraged! I mean really, ask yourself? Who wants to see a differnt type of summer blockbuster. Not me! If you haven't notice I'm being sarcastic. This is amazing film that I can't wait to watch again and again. I just hope people are smart enough to understand a good movie and a classic like this one. And don't shy away from it just because its different! And don't bash it just because you did not understand it.
0525951652|1.0|I will not buy this book at the current price.  If the price had been even 12.99 for the kindle, i would have.  I will wait until it comes out on paperback.  So Penquin,  you lose.

B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the most interesting show on tv today.  It makes all of us think about ourselves and how we would act in the same situation.  I sincerely hope we never have to find out but I do wonder. I think Andrew Lincoln, (Rick) has a lot of compasion for the living and the dead. Although he does some things that confuse his son Carl. For example, how can he go back to a city infested with zombies, leaving his family so he can help a bad guy. Carl has to be my absolutely favorite character.  He is cute as a button. Just imagine what a child that age must be going thru. Leaving his home, the security it provides, school, and everything he knows. Not knowing if his father will return and then what the future will hold.  A little less gore would be nice but if you watch some of the popular cop drama episodes I have actually seen worse. Like Chandler Riggs, (Carl) once said when asked that question, he replied,\\"I know it's fake and just pretend. It really doesn't bother or scare me.\\" So if it doesn't bother a child that age that sees it every day, I guess it shouldn't bother us!!!!
B00408MS5S|4.0|Two discs-46,65 minutes each approximately.  The remastered sound is very good-there's a crispness, without being harsh, to the original studio album, and the live tracks, while not as open sounding as the studio tracks, are still very good.  Voices and instruments are clearly defined in the mix.  The discs are snapped inside the four-fold holder.  Unlike past \\"Deluxe Editions\\", this release doesn't have the clear plastic outer sleeve.  Instead there's a plastic band around the bottom portion, which is perforated for easy opening.  The graphics inside the package consist of ads and magazine covers featuring SUPERTRAMP, plus two photographs of \\"cities\\" similar to the cover.  The 35 page booklet has an overview of both the group and the album, written by Phil Alexander, Editor of Mojo Magazine.  Also include are lyrics for the original album, and a number of color and b&w photos of the group.<br /><br />\\"Breakfast In America\\" was, arguably, the group's best album.  But a case could be made for \\"Crime of the Century\\", \\"Even In the Quietest Moments\\", or even \\"Crisis?  What Crisis\\"?  All had good, well written, well arranged songs, plus a number of commercially popular tunes.  Even when they recorded in the U.S., they had a very English/cup of tea sound, which helped give the band a unique identity.  If you've read this far, chances are you're at least familiar with \\"Breakfast...\\", or an outright fan (like me) of the band.  So it's not really necessary to detail the original album.<br /><br />The live disc, with tracks from Wembley, Miami, and more tracks from the \\"Paris\\" concert, all from 1979, make up, to some extent, the \\"Breakfast...\\" album.  Five tracks recreate a good portion (2-6 from the original album) of that album, even though \\"Gone Hollywood\\" is sadly absent.  The other tracks (songs include \\"Even In the Quietest Moments\\", \\"Rudy\\", \\"Give a Little Bit\\", and others), are all crowd favorites, and add a bit of depth to this release.  As I wrote previously, the sound is very good-immediate, crisp, and clean.  The band recreates the songs to something approaching the studio versions.  And that's fine, up to a point.  Never known for their improvisational skills, nevertheless it would've been great to hear the band stretch out a bit instrumentally, or vary the tempo slightly to add interest and depth to familiar tunes.<br /><br />But in the end, these songs are just fine as examples of SUPERTRAMP in concert (hear the live \\"Paris\\" album)-delivering their unique songs and sound to an enthusiastic crowd.  And with this live collection, we get to hear more from this underrated, yet fine, band.  Hopefully we'll hear their other albums, from this same era, in similar editions.nd is very good-immediate, crisp, and clean.

B003WTE886|5.0|Just how popular is Taylor Swift?  Her first two albums are certified by RIAA as shipping 5 million copies each, which helped lead up to the highly anticipated release of her 3rd studio album, Speak Now.  Not exactly pausing for breath, in its first week Speak Now earned a place in the record books by selling over one million copies.  Coming at a time of struggling sales, this was simply an unbelievable feat, considering this is something which has never been accomplished by any single studio album in country music history.<br /><br />In general, Speak Now shows a good amount of maturity and growth from Taylor, who is now 20 years old.  Gone are the youthful songs about her freshman year of high school -- replaced with songs which often reflect back on the thrills and beauty of childhood, songs about the growing up, and the reality of living on her own for the first time.  Many songs have themes which are grown up enough to relate with her older fans, while the song melodies themselves are still similar to past songs and youthful enough to keep her younger fans enthusiastic as ever.  Also, just as on her two previous albums, Taylor still isn't afraid to get personal and name-drop guys (\\"Dear John\\" for example) who inspired her to write these songs.<br /><br />Taylor has always been known for having a hand in writing every song on her multiple CD's.  However, this time she went even further, and penned the entire album without any co-writers.  You can see the results of this in song lyrics which are raw, honest, captivating, and even more personal than ever.  Listening to the album may leave you with a feeling like you just read her diary.<br /><br />In her latest single, \\"Back To December,\\" the pain and heartbreak that Taylor is dealing with can actually be felt in her voice.  It's evident that she's singing about a true story - pouring out feelings of regret - which is coming from deep inside.  This heart-wrenching ballad is different than any of her previous hits, because Taylor is actually apologizing for how she behaved in a relationship.  Taylor says she'd go back in time to change her regretful actions if she could, but admits that it may be too late, and that she understands if he cannot give her another chance.  Swallowing her pride, she humbles herself, and asks if he can possibly forgive her, \\"Wishing that I realized what I had when you were mine.\\"  Taylor acknowledges that the breakup was entirely due to her mistakes, unlike any past song in her large catalog of hits, which often blame either the male character or another female character for ruining a relationship.  \\"Back To December\\" shows a side of Taylor which we have rarely seen, and displays a maturity in her songwriting.  It is one of the strongest songs on the album, and will likely become a big hit on both Country and Pop radio.<br /><br />Just as in her past two albums, Speak Now displays Taylor's talent of writing ridiculously catchy songs.  \\"Sparks Fly\\" sounds like the catchiest, most radio friendly song on the album, and it should be a sure-fire hit.  It's an irresistible feel-good song, which makes it easy to see why the performance has been such a live concert favorite for the past year.  The lyrics and tone of \\"Sparks Fly\\" somewhat remind me of a song from her previous Fearless album, \\"The Way I Loved You\\".  Both songs deal with a relationship which she knows is trouble, but she just can't resist it.  In \\"Sparks Fly\\", Taylor sings, \\"My mind forgets to remind me, you're a bad idea / You're the kind of reckless that should send me running / But I kind of know that I won't get far.\\"  The chorus goes on to describe the intense and dramatic feelings she gets every time they're together.  Taylor concludes a well written bridge by stating, \\"I'm captivated by you baby, like a fireworks show.\\"  It's an upbeat, guitar driven song, with a strong hook and chorus -- catchy enough to stick with you for a long time.<br /><br />Taylor also showcases her maturity byplaying the role of a big sister in a few songs, including the masterful, \\"Never Grow Up.\\"  \\"Never Grow Up\\" is an acoustic lullaby, which speaks about the youthful and carefree ways of children, and how she wishes life could stay that way.  Although the song may not be radio-friendly enough to ever get released as a single, to me it's easily the highlight of the album.  This is just an absolutely beautiful song -- sweet, sad, and deeply emotional.  The lyrics are touching; directed at the preciousness of a child, \\"So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light / To you, everything's funny, you got nothing to regret / I'd give all I have, honey, If you could stay like that.\\"  Taylor stresses the importance of childhood, and advises her audience not to take it for granted.  The simple production, quiet acoustic guitar, and pure emotional vocals make an extremely potent song even more powerful.<br /><br />Taylor explores a wider range of musical genres on Speak Now, and this album is distinctly less country sounding than her previous CD's.  For example, the heavy, driving electric guitars in \\"Better Than Revenge\\" almost have a Pop-Punk sound -- similar to popular Avril Lavigne singles from the past decade.  The song doesn't sound anything like previous Taylor Swift material.  It's a loud and angry tune, where a furious Taylor is warning another girl to keep in mind, \\"There's nothing I do better than revenge.\\"  On the flip side, there is one song on the album, \\"Mean,\\" which does sound extremely country.  It's loaded with fiddle, saturated with banjo, and drives a catchy, funky sounding chorus.  The lyrics are also solid, taking on her critics and haters, asking \\"Why you gotta be so mean?\\"  The song can also serve as a general response to all the bullying that goes on in society, a topic receiving a great deal of public attention of late.<br /><br />Out of the 14 songs on the CD, there really aren't any tracks which I would consider \\"album filler.\\"  It's very strong top-to-bottom, with a lot of variety, and a little something for everyone.  Maybe this is the reason why Taylor is so popular, able to reach such a wide audience, and sell over a million albums in one week?

B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and would recommend it.  I liked the series and the first movie so I wasn't surprised how good this one was.
0439023513|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books immensely.  This one seemed rushed.  The second district vs capitol war arc is incredibly abbreviated and characters that Collins' devoted pages to flesh out seemingly die left and right in a span of a few sentences.  What irks me the most is how wishy washy Katniss has become in this book -- will she accept the role as the \\"mockingjay\\" -- the symbol of the resistance or won't she?  Peeta or Gale?  Although Collins does answer all the pertinent questions at the end of the book, I still felt rather empty and disappointed.
B001JEPVDM|1.0|Apparently I read the wrong book.  I found this to be so boring that I gave up on it about 20% into it.    Just couldn't take any more. I suppose it got better at some point...it must have..but I just couldn't last that long.   Waste of money.  Are the 5-star reviewers shilling for the publisher?
B003ICWTR4|5.0|Amazing. That's the one word that comes to mind when thinking aboutd this DVD.<br /><br />The performance is great, almost of it in broad daylight. As always, Springsteen and the E-Stree Band are giving their best.<br /><br />Sound is great, and gool-old Bob Clearmountain is the mixing engineer. Also, I must thanks director Chris Wilson (or his editeur) for the great editing, that thanfully does not follow the actual trend of blinding-fast cuts where you can not even see what's happening! Other than Bruce, the the one who clearly gets more screen time is drummer Max Weinberg. The relacement of deceased Danny Federici of course handles the job well, but has very few screen time. Garry TAllent as always is almosta invisible and like a statue, but giving his best and absurdly precise.<br /><br />Pat Scialfa is absent, but that's due to taking care of the children at home. Sosie Tyrrell is strong, as also are Van Zandt (apparently the most affected by age) and Lofgren.<br /><br />The set list is a gem. Bruce's catalogue is so vast and high-quality, that he can choose effortlessly to change it from tour to tour or even from show to show. Tha inclusion of \\"No Surrender\\" and \\"Bobby Jean\\" were a plus for me.<br /><br />Image quality is top. Sound is also top. I'm not sure enough if I can rate this as good as the unvincible \\"Live in NYC\\", but it's a winner anyway.
B000J4QWMC|3.0|This movie may be entitled, Miami Vice.    But it is not Miami Vice.    It is is about to detectives who happen to work in Miami, and coincidentally happen to be named Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs.     I have heard other reviews saying this is an updated version of Miami Vice with modern characters. OK, I can accept that but that does not hide the flaws of this movie, which are many.    - Colin Farrell performs poorly as Sonny Crockett. He does not have the charisma or charm of Don Johnson. Jamie Foxx ain't great either. Many of the supporting actors in the Vice squad have very limited roles.    - There are many gritty, shaky, night scenes. Some people like that, I don't.    - An absence of music or playing the wrong music for the scene. I remember hardly any music during the first half of the movie. This is unforgivable for a movie entitled, Miami Vice. Remember how in the TV pilot they had Sonny's car drive down the streets of Miami with Phil Collins' music on? In the first part of this movie, they drive down the street with hardly any music.    - Then there are scenes where the music is totally inappropriate: during a night scene, with high speed boats cruising on the water, and a dangerous situation at hand, what music do they choose to play? A tense, fast beat music would fit the scene. However, the music played during the movie is \\"slow-mo\\" pensive music.    - There is no camaraderie between Sonny and Tubbs. Their scenes do not give the viewers the impression that they have been friends or partners for a long time. There is a awkward tenseness between the characters.    - The story itself contains an element of Smuggler's Blues, but there are a few subplots and other characters which serve to distract me from the main story. Some of the decisions by characters make no sense.    - For a story about Miami Vice, very precious little took place in Miami. Not many good shots of its skyline, the streets or other exciting aspects of Miami.     - Not sure why theycast Gong Li in the film. Perhaps a Latina actress would have been better suited to the role.    - The Castillo actor performed poorly compared to Edward James Olmos.    - The movie was not fun, enjoyable, or emotional - something that Miami Vice should have in spades. Remember in the TV series how Don Johnson played an emotional, charming character, with goodness and flaws, and full of passion? How he felt sad and melancholy when he had to leave his family at the safe house during the the episode, Calderone' Return, as Sonny's Theme played in the background? It was a great emotional moment as walked with his wife on the beach, knowing he might get killed by a hitman. That was an emotional moment and you felt it. This movie, however, does not contain these types of emotional scenes. The characters in this movie go through the motions, but I did feel the emotionality of it.    There is no relation to the spirit, style, cinematography or music that was used in the TV series (first two seasons). But since I am a great fan of the TV series, I am going to give this movie 2.5 to 3 stars just because it used the name Miami Vice (2 stars or less otherwise).    Think of it as a movie about Vice cops, dealing with drugs, drug leaders, and assorted bad people. Many scenes happen outside of Miami, and when in Miami, it does not showcase Miami well.    But don't expect this movie to be \\"MIAMI VICE\\". It's in name only. They should probably rename this movie, and then make a real Miami Vice movie. I am not asking for a repeat of the 80s, but it should have spirit of the television series.
1597801585|3.0|This book reminds me of James Clavell's novels in the 70's. It's a ripping tale with well developed characters. As visionary? Not at all developed to that level. Not Thailand, Southeast Asia, or the science are that well presented. This is readable and entertaining, great for the plane or a quiet Sunday afternoon. But don't get carried away.

B000L3CHC0|4.0|Bought this watch about 2 weeks ago.  Prior to that, I spent a fair amount of time researching different watches at different price points with the intent to find the best \\"everyday\\" watch that could go with anything from a t-shirt to a tuxedo.  Tissot stood out as a reputable brand and the PRC 200 model in particular has a classy, clean, and elegant style that doesn't come across as a gaudy, in-your-face conspicuous consumption item.      In trying to convey the feel of this watch, you get the sense that it is a real men's watch: it is durable, confident, and it has substance. It is not a poseur suggesting the wearer is trying overcompensate for something, nor does it come across as a cheap piece of costume jewelery.  The additional dials makes it interesting and gives it some complexity, but it doesn't overpower the overall face of the watch. Love the yellow accent color with the black face; a little pop that tastefully distinguishes it from a lot of other cookie-cutter type watches that tend to dominate the more \\"conservative look\\" segment.  The date window is easy to see and read at the 4 o'clock position.  The brushed/polished stainless steel band and clasp looks good and feel nice to the touch.      With average to small sized wrists, I was a bit worried about the size and thickness of the watch and it being a bit too big, but it actually fits and looks really good in real life.  It has a comfortable weight to it as well.    All in all, it is a great watch in the $300-$400 range and I consider it to be very good value.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Joan Crawford won the Academy Award for Best Actress for this much beloved Michael Curtiz noir film (her first major work for warner's after leaving MGM), but the real reason to see it is Ann Blyth in her great performance as Veda, the monstrously ungrateful daughter. Blyth never got much of a chance during her career to strut her stuff very much: with a piping soprano and a pretty smile, she was mostly stuck playing ingenue parts in Technicolor musicals or light comedy parts in popular fare like MR. PEABODY AND THE MERMAID. But here she got the role of a lifetime and she never lets it go: usually sugary-sweet, her Veda is capable of betraying hideous snobbery or cruelty without ever dropping the polite smirk. The writers (mostly the screenplay is the work of Ranald MacDougall, though William Faulkner had a hand in it) seemed to have risen to the occasion and give Blyth some of the funniest poisonous little lines of the era: \\"My mother--a waitress!\\" she hisses once she discovers the truth about how Joan Crawford has been supporting the family. This isn't Crawford's best work for Warner's (that would come two years later with POSSESSED), and at times she gives into her habit (as Pauline Kael memorably put it) of looking as if she has toothache when she intends to emote very heavily, but her hairstyle and outfits in this role are iconic, and she's fairly funny when she has to wait tables and issue snappy barking orders to her restaurant's cooks. Lots of fine character actors are about as fun as they ever were in their careers playing some of their most typical roles in this movie: Eve Arden as the heroine's smartmouthed best friend, Zacharty Scott as Mildred's oily lover, Jack Carson as the oafish chump who keeps hitting on Mildred and who gets in trouble for his pains. There's also a nice tiny performance by Lee Patrick as the vulgar but kindhearted Mrs. Biederhof, for whom Mildred's first husband leaves her. This is one of the most pleasurable noir films of the period, smartly photographed and expensively staged: it's a real treat.
B0040QYROK|5.0|While the film is fantastic and the extra footage much appreciated, Kino missed a real opportunity here to produce an excellent disc with a wide-range of extras.  If you want the extras from previous Kino releases, you won't find them here.  There's no commentary track.  The Kino website notes that if you live outside North America, you must buy the Masters of Cinema Eureka BD/DVD, which is also released this week.  Yes, now that edition has loads of extras, including a commentary by David Kalat, a 56 page book, and the original German intertitles, which are missing here.  And guess what?  That region B/2 edition is cheaper!  So I suggest you buy a multi-region player and get a better edition than this one.  Unfortunately, if you don't also have a multi-region BD player, you're out of luck, as the MoC edition is region-locked.  But at least you could get the DVD and watch the extras.  Honestly, it boggles the mind that Kino has neglected this release, especially when their own site references the other release.  If in a few years, Kino tries to get more money out of me by marketing an extras-packed edition of Metropolis, I won't be buying it.
B0041T52S6|3.0|Comparing theater attendance (poor) with Amazon ratings (very high) offers a good perspective on this film, which a minority will really love, for good reasons, and a majority will really dislike, for equally good reasons. There is a core of good will, optimism, and, yes, charm that struck me as authentic and this is the only reason that I did not hit \\"stop\\" after two minutes, as I was sorely tempted to do. I can see why a minority of viewers (majority of Amazion reviewers) really liked this film. But I wish I had gone with instinct and saved two hours. Here's why.  A teeny bit of genuineness is not a reason to make a movie. The gamer schtick (tons of visuals ranging from instant to draggy) was, for me, just a whole lot of frosting. The indie music schtick (and it really is schtick) was similarly insignificant, though pleasant enough. The comic book schtick -- and some of us don't care about how true, to the third decimal place, the film is to the comic -- is truly old hat. In my opinion, the director avoids turning all the characters into really flat \\"types\\" that we've seen before (the gay friend, the kooky girl, the kookier girl, the cynical musician/adversary, etc.) and I really liked that, but on the downside, none of the characters themselves had any real appeal or depth. Michael Cera yet again \\"plays\\" the same mumbling softie, rubber stamped as \\"endearing,\\" but his character never actually says or does anything to warrant such affection. The other characters are similarly shallow as puddles. Other than colored hair, what\\"s \\"it\\" about the \\"it\\" girl? What's to like, really, about any of these characters? That the film does seem to have a good heart and good intentions, and a load of potential, just makes the poor direction, performances, and art direction more disappointing. This seems to me a fairly good idea done quite badly.
B0021L8V1G|4.0|The movie's great and fantastic, something people of all ages could enjoy.  The sex-tone is lowered a bit from the fist one, and a good bit of plots from the comic book from which this is based are compacted in this movie.  My only problem is with the second disk.  The special features are nice, but just that... \\"nice\\".  Nothing really spectacular, and the Blu Ray version is supposed to be more complete.  Besides, the BR comes with the DVD, and since we all know DVDs will be gone in a few years, you could get your own BR version so you don't have to copy again later.  It feels like falling for Blu Ray even if you're not prepared for it (with all the gadgets made for it) but that's the way this business is like.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|I didn't see it in the theater (big mistake), the trailer did not seem more than the usual... friend loaned a DVD, watched it 3 times... it is an amazing movie (Ok, no scintillating dialogue and very broad characters, you will never notice after the first 10 minutes). Fell in love with the movie (and Pandora, were do I get some of those bio-luminescent plants?), disappointed there were none of the usual materials included in that release, perfect timing... here it is, I didn't even have to wait long.    The packing is pathetic, if I had paid more than $19.00 for it I'd probably return it and wait for the next release. Nothing I have purchased in board packaging does not end up scratched no matter how careful I am, the index is printed on a separate piece of paper that flutters to the floor, watch for it. I'll be putting them in real DVD cases.    Worse...The arrangement is beyond comprehension, both the theatrical release and the directors cut are arranged, part 1 (of each) on disc 1, part two (of each) on disc 2, yes, you stop and put in the second disc to see the second half of each version. What were they thinking? Did they not want us to get too involved?    The scenes added to the directors cut, wonderful.  Deleted scenes, presented in a way demonstrates the genius and making of Avatar.   The production videos are fantastic, my only complaint, I could have watched more. I even excuse the dorky bit in the end about \\"what making the movie meant to me\\", accompanies the credits...  Worth the price if you do not want to wait for them to hear the complaints and re release it... again...    Would love to hear their explanation for splitting the movies.

B00003JRCQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this version of Persuasion, but I'm very picky with this story (It's my favorite Austen work). There's some pretty good hidden eye contact between the romantic leads, but it still doesn't live up to the amount of romantic tension in the novel. My main beef is that the actress who played Ann simply isn't very attractive, and the kiss featured so very prominently on the cover is the only one of the movie. I also didn't like the way they handled the \\"Mr. Elliot\\" plotline.
B000001DQG|5.0|\\"Caribou\\" was my first LP.  \\"Ticking\\" is the song for me.  So many have said that \\"Caribou\\" was an afterthought by Elton and Bernie.  Not true.  If you are really a fan, and you don't have this-you've done yourself a disfavor.  So many hits on \\"Caribou\\", so many favorites that didn't make the charts.  Get this one.

0307473473|5.0|I remember reading about Steig Larsson's second book in his \\"Millennium\\" Trilogy in a Readers Digest. Within a few years Mr. Larsson has become a critical and financial success with his three books, there is one problem, He's not living anymore. Now going on 6 years Larsson's books were published here in the states after he had died and that truly is a shame. This book should be on the must read list of every bibliophile like myself.<br />Mr. Larsson has created a book that is impossible to look at on your bookshelf once you start it and not devote your entire time to finishing it. I read this book during my breaks at work and was immersed in the world he had created and was gripped with the power of it, this is one heck of a book.<br />I must warn readers, it's slow going at first, but like good roller coasters, the hill is always the slowest. By the end of the book I felt like I devoured a full satisfying meal of suspense and intrigue and there are two more.<br />Larsson is one of those authors who left us too soon, had he lived long enough he could have the status of such thrill makers as Michael Connoly and Jeffery Deaver. I am going to see if I can get everyone I know to read this book, because I want to share this wonderful gem of literature everyone.<br />So sit back, strap in, and hold on tight. Once you meet this girl you'll never be the same
B0017KIBAI|5.0|It is what it is. It's a Gamecube controller. Nothing less, nothing more. Except the added feet in cabling. The cable is now almost 10 feet long, which is very nice, considering how short the original Gamecube controller's was. Really, if you need a Gamecube controller (be it for your original Gamecube or Wii), this is the absolute best one, period. Sure, people might say the Wavebird is the best Gamecube controller, but it doesn't have rumble, and for me that's a deal breaker. With this white Gamecube controller, you get rumble, and the very long 10 foot cable more than makes up for the wireless.
B00433QE3M|5.0|How can you not like this?  Spot ON!  From the era of music with a soul not music from a can. I thought Santana couldn't do it again. If you listen with just your ears and not the soul you will never get it.
B001B7CNXI|2.0|Miami Vice is a great police drama.  Unfortunately, the video quality of the Blu-Ray leaves much to be desired.  Reviews on DVD Talk and other forums mention the presence of film \\"grain\\" during the darker scenes (night scenes etc.).  Unfortunately, large portions of the film are \\"dark scenes\\".  At it's worst, the video is simply unwatchable.  I also own the DVD, and I find the DVD to be a more satisfying home movie experience.  That aside, there are segments of the film which are free from the grainy background noise.  These scenes offer a sharp picture with vivid color rendering.  Too bad this doesn't hold true for the whole feature.  The audio quality is about what you would expect from a Blu-Ray.  Miami Vice is a great movie, but you should buy the DVD.
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|I read Rework on a flight yesterday thanks to a recommendation from Mike Cearly [...]. As did he, I also found it to be insightful and worth the time.<br /><br />A resounding theme of the book is how informality and colloquialism have made a major push & impact in the business environment. Acting all \\"businessy\\" just doesn't get things done. Or as the author put it: \\"Don't be afraid to show your flaws. Imperfections are real and people respond to real.\\"<br /><br />In the digital signage business, this comes up A LOT. A player is down, the OS blew up, the screen is out, the content sucks...there are a lot of things that can go wrong in a DOOH operation. Its wise not to hide from them & cover them up. Customers dont want that. If you own up to issues and share the truth, you can embrace/fix the problem and everyone can grow from it.<br /><br />Other topics that I believed in are the ideas on hiring, the \\"manager of one\\", marketing through earned media and not through spammy press releases, and teaching + sharing your secrets. His take on meetings (they suck) seems pretty right on as well.<br /><br />I probably dont agree that geographically displaced teams can be more effective than locally collaborative but the the author does make some good points with regards to focus and the negative impact of being interrupted.<br /><br />Its an all around startup and total business package book. Valuable imo to anyone who cares enough to want to positively impact their company or start one themselves.<br /><br />I've collated my kindle highlights in a google doc here: [...]<br /><br />Thanks for bringing it to my attention Mike and I look forward to future recommendations.
159562015X|4.0|The book arrived on time, and it was actually a pretty good book.  I thought the way they defined the strengths were very clear and concise.  Sometimes there were descriptions that I wouldn't necessarily have thought of.  It was used for a college class that I attend.  Hopefully I will get a good grade!
B003TML0VO|5.0|I know a lot of these reviews weren't giving particularly high marks to this cd but I totally disagree.  I will agree that I don't consider these songs The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time but the title is the only thing I have negative to say about it.    I thought this was the best version of Photograph I've ever heard and I loved the original.  I just thought this better as I think Daughtry doing the vocals knocks it out of the park.  Chris is a terrific singer!    And OMG! While my Guitar Gently Weeps is AMAZING.  Carlos is outstanding in his playing on this one.  It is so hauntingly beautiful!    And while nobody can touch AC/DC's rendition of Back in Black, I have to say I love NAS's version of the song too and I generally don't care for this kind of music but it was great.    I just don't understand a lot of the low reviews as I truly think the cd is fantasic.     Carlos Santana is very innovative and this cd just proves it once again.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|im just going to throw my review out there-a review of the show so far and not of the product(box set)-i think that this is the greates show i have ever seen. all charcters has powerful performances behind them, and every character is loveable.   i did not start watching this as my lost subsititute. this is my LOST because in my mind fringe is way better than lost.   i have enjoyed every episode of this wonderful show (minus the glee spinoff) and cant wait for it every week, there is only one thing i am sad about though.     Thats the fact that this very well may be the last season. i really wish it wasnt, but i have a strong feeling that season 4 will never come. it makes me so sad that so many people wont give this show a shot, it really needs more viewers than its already got.   please watch fringe because this is possibly the greatest show ever created. it needs awards, and more advertising. but sadly it doesnt get that because FOX is full of morons.
B000KIE11Q|5.0|This is a great Swatch. Originally designed in 1999, the watch is so popular that it continues to be sold ten years later. This is unusual for Swatch, a company which routinely rotates and changes its product line two or three times per year, and speaks to the durability and elegance of the design.<br /><br />The watch is presented in a stainless steel case and band, with a hard rubber insert design to connect links. The metallic parts of the band are a polished, semi-shiny silver design. A black face with high accent chrome hands and a shiny black outer dial, providing a combination of both dress and sport appearance. This watch can be worn with both dress and casual apparel. Because of its design, this watch is physically heavier than most Swatches (many Swatches are made with aluminum bands which are extremely lightweight), but no more than most other watches of its type, and certainly not bothersome in wearing.<br /><br />The overall impact and appearance of the watch is a dressy/sporty look, and, like many Swatches, appears much more expensive than it actually is. Quality is first rate, both with the physical construction of the band and case, but also of the internal movement, all being made -- as all Swatches are -- in Switzerland. Time-keeping accuracy is first rate-rate.<br /><br />I bought this watch in Paris back in 2002, one of the first Swatches I ever purchased. After nearly ten years of wearing, finally one of the rubber inserts broke. The folks at the Swatch store on the Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;e in Paris replaced the link at no charge to me last year (2009). The watch is still one of my favorite Swatches. Five stars.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I know that if anybody stumbles across this review now, it is probably going to be because they're Christmas shopping - all diehard Beatles fans have had this CD for many years, now. This is a great one to start somebody off with, the songs all having gone to #1, and the remixing is fantastic. The Beatles are such a part of history now that it does seem hard to believe that there's anybody out there who wouldn't just immediately put out the money for the complete recordings, etc., but I just bought an extra copy of this for a pre-teen whom, this year, loves the Four Moptops. If she's still into them next Christmas, then yep, I will look at more involved sets, etc., but for now, a great stocking stuffer/starter!!! =)
B0044XV3QY|4.0|My rating came short of the full 5 stars because of the Horrible Packaging for the DVD. The DVD's come in a nice hardcover-ish book slipcase but why o' why would they put this fantastic movie in cheap paper sleeves to be easily SCRATCHED UPON REMOVAL???? With the money this movie made, they couldn't put them in plastic cases, let alone in a BETTER PACKAGE????? Going to exchange mine for the 2nd time!!!! Again, 5 stars without the packaging, 4 with!    Enjoy your AVATAR: SCRATCHED EDITION!!!
0061703257|5.0|Loved this book, yet wanted to throw it across the room at the end due to the surprise ending. If you want good plot twists and you haven't seen the movie, read this book! Excellent plot twists throughout the book, but the real big one is well hidden. Lehane did a great job of explaining the torment of Teddy's mind.<br /><br />For an added effect, read this novel during stormy weather. It happened to be hurricane season when I read this and that made me read this up into the wee hours in the morning cause I was too freaked to fall asleep, haha.
1416583432|2.0|Disappointed in the book.  It's a hard read, big words, and who cares if dogs have a higher flicker-fusion rate?!  I really expected to know what a dog sees, and his perception, when he looks at his master.  It does support what I already knew - four legs are there primarily to carry a nose around - the dog's biggest asset.   Beyond that, nah.
0811870413|5.0|Though I have baked my own bread for many years and had often read about creating a starter to make sourdough bread, I had never tried it - the closest I have come is using a poolish. I used this book for my first foray into wild yeast bread and, though the process was quite involved (though not difficult, or even very time consuming - just protracted), it was a terrific success, I was VERY happy with the final result.     Prior to purchasing the book, I was not aware of the fact that the baking technique featured used a Dutch oven and this probably would have made me decide against buying it. Admittedly, I was a little disappointed when I discovered this on my read through when it arrived. Luckily my husband had one in his camping gear! The resulting Basic Country Bread was fantastic.     I am now on my second round of the Basic Country Bread; adapting the timing  in order for us to have the bread fresh for lunch rather than the evening meal.    Next weekend I am planning to have a go at the Baguettes/English Muffins, neither of which use the Dutch oven so I am excited to see the results.    I am very happy with my purchase.

B003XU75QG|5.0|Just a short and sweet review.  I bought this cd for my teenage daughter and I actually ended up liking it alot.  It's refreshing to see a young group who does their own thing and isn't following the awful sick bubblegum music that every other teen star does.  Great cd.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|Good movie. It should have been done in two parts like, \\"The Deathly Hallows\\", is being done because sooooo many good parts had to be edited or left out completely.
B0000025H0|5.0|This was one of the first CDs I ever bought back when it was first released in the early 80s. I have over 2200 CDs but always enjoy a listen to Marathon even after 30 years. Great tunes well executed. Yes... more commercial than previous Santana work but still original and interesting. The guitar work does not dominate this album and that's OK. The bass playing really stands out and just enough keyboards. It's great.
0894803123|5.0|I bought an ice cream maker and needed recipes for ice cream. I saw this book on Amazon and said why not use a recipe from an ice cream expert. I tried the chocolate and French vanilla recipes. Delicious! The recipes were easy to follow and were ready in no time.
B0043ZDU1E|3.0|Long time Loreena fan.  Not nearly as lush and exotic as her previous albums, the first six tracks still satisfy.  'The Star of the County Down' is just so fun and lively, it's very infectious.  That said, beginning with 'The Death of Queen Jane', the last few tracks are depressing and are really hard to enjoy.  The selection of Queen Jane is just mind boggling considering the fairly uptempo tunes that precede it.  You can have thoughtful and melancholy tunes (Lady of Shallot), but 'Queen Jane' is just morose.  Come on Loreena, it's okay to have fun...you don't need to balance fun & sprightly tunes with such depressing ones such as that.  My recommendation is to download the first six tracks, and skip the other ones.
B00007KQA3|5.0|i remember how when i was much younger i had to read the book from cover to cover four times before i understood the book's meaning and on the fourth time i could actually feel what and how winston must have actually felt.utter dispair and hopelessness. what a frightfull feeling.the movie is very good,but doesn't quite give that feeling.maybe no movie version could.as usual hurt and burton were great.it seems that we may be approaching that form of life and government now here in america.
0316010669|2.0|Throughout the book, the author offers numerous examples of how people make snap judgments, and how some of these are harmful while others are more accurate than decisions made after over-analysis.  Unfortunately, though, the author doesn't say much about how to distinguish the two.  I think we all know that people make snap decisions and that some work out and some don't.  Gladwell tells us little more than that.  For a book like this, it would've been much more helpful if Gladwell could offer insights as to how and when people should use snap judgments rather than just offering examples of them.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|Once again, Norah Jones does not disappoint. Her new album is such an ecclectic mix of collaborating musicians that you feel like you are going back and forth through different time periods. As someone born and raised in Louisiana, her rendition of \\"Blue Bayou\\" with M. Ward takes me right back to my childhood! I definitely recommend this CD...would even be a fabulous gift!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wonderful story. Who would have know that a dog would be so faithful! Love dogs myself. Always had a dog in this household. Probably always will.
B001CDLATE|5.0|I know many people are waiting for \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" on Blu-Ray because I see it on many people's wish list.  But this release of \\"Baraka\\" by Ron Fricke is about the closest we are going to get to the \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" concept on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />These are the kinds of films that Blu-Ray High Definition was meant for.  We want to see every small detail of all the beauty as well as all the not so pleasant visuals of our strange world.<br /><br />Ron Fricke put together some of the unique religious practices of various obscure countries, plus their current living life style, be it through riches or devastating poverty, this film gives you a window to the outside world, far from where you are and of what you can imagine.  On a big screen TV, this Blu-Ray film will definitely take you away from your natural comfort zone environment and put you right there on the other side of the world.<br /><br />You will remember that \\"Koyaanisqatsi\\" was based on life in America before and after technology improved as well as deteriorated God's beautiful landscape, and then \\"Powaqqatsi\\" showed us more about other various third world countries.  This film of \\"Baraka\\" is a reasonable mix of both concepts.
015206396X|3.0|I'll start by saying that I'm just a little surprised at how many glowing reviews this book is recieving. I had to read it for my school as an independent reading assignment. Because it was recieved so well, I immediately ran and picked it up. Now I have to give credit where it is due. Graceling DOES have some strong points. The writing is decent, the characters are okay...And it did keep me interested for the first several chapters. But...  Let's just be frank, Cashore has some REALLY poor skills in pacing and consistency.The constant descriptions of completely irrelevant things like fishing, sewing, EATING, building camp, etc (things that shouldn't really get to me) got on my nerves. I know tiny descriptions can add realism and body to the setting, but, honestly, I could really care less about what Katsa ate for breakfast, what type of string she used to lace Po's shoe, or the little twig she tossed into the fire.  Coinciding with the above is probably the biggest thing that bothers me: The complete and utter lack of action. I mean for a book about a girl who's good at KILLING, there's very little instances of this being shown. At points I felt like yelling \\"Your supposed to be this awesome kick-butt action girl. Stop mooning over Po and get off your butt already and start killing people!\\" Or at least knock more people senseless.  I mean I can appreciate a rather slow book...As long as it has something that compensates for the lack of action. (Ex: characterization, a sense of mystery, interesting features, etc.) This fits Harry Potter like a glove. Despite it having very long build up until the real action started, it was so fun to read. The reason for this, is because the characters popped right off the pages and spoke to the reader, there was constant mystery that forced you to think, and, let's not kid ourselves, Hogwarts is a very fun place to read about. But, in Graceling 75% of the scenes featured, added absolutely nothing to the plot or characterization.  Which leads to another thing: The characters...Seriously, Po was okay, but he is kind of a shallow puddle when compared to more well-rounded characters. Katsa was eeriely similar to Katniss down to the name. With the exception that Katniss is made up of all kinds of awesome and is my favorite protagonist of any book I've read. And while I do respect Katsa, she really came off as trying too hard to be feminist to the point where its ironically sexist in its own way. She doesn't want to marry, doesn't want kids, against a relationship etc. Now those things really don't bother me, but it mostly feels like she's just against those things because she feels she should attach a stigma to all things \\"feminine\\" and not because it's just how she wants to live her life or her preferences. We get it Katsa. You don't want kids, you don't want to marry. That became clear the ummteenth time you said it.  Another thing, there are mostly two types of young female characters in this book. The strong, gruff straw feminist like Katsa and the weak, helpless victim like Bitterblue or that girl from the hotel. I can't even owe it to the age of these girls. Why can't we meet a twelve year old who doesn't have to deal with perverts or is completely happy and fun loving? It really feels like Cashore is stressing the importance of feminism, yet feels that in order for a girl to be happy and strong, she must be COMPLETELY against the traditional roles of women and has to be tomboyish. And I'm saying this as a young girl myself. I know their society is very demeaning to women, but, that's no excuse for the girls to often be tragic maidens who always need help.  Sorry for my ranting. I just wanted to add my two cents. To wrap this up, I'll say that while it was a chore to read through many of the dragging parts, somewhat annoying character types, and an unrealized \\"climax\\", I couldn't help but feel a little closure toward the end. All and all not a terrible book but not something that I'd ever want to read a second time. You may want to stay away from this book if you have very low patience like I do.
B003405MF6|5.0|Jeff Beck is one of my favorite guitarists, so of course I'm biased. But this album contains some of his best playing in years. As always with him, you can question some of his choices regarding material, but no matter what the song, he wrings every ounce of emotion out of the tune and every speck of expression out of his guitar.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|Amazingly poetic & original, Mumford & Sons are what music should be.  With insanely perfect harmonies and proficient use of the banjo (don't let that discourage you, Rockers), these boys are destined to continue to sell millions of records.  I love this album and will continue to listen to it daily...even after they come out with the next one.    PS-See them live.
B0014KD46W|4.0|I have yet to hear a Steve Winwood album that doesn't have its great moments, but \\"Nine Lives\\" is a special one. This is a great album throughout, partly because the songwriting is some of the strongest of Steve's career. Winwood is easy to forget about sometimes -- maybe it's his seemingly easygoing personality. But every time I go back to him, I marvel at his amazing voice and excellent musicianship. He's a true craftsman.
B000M5AJQI|1.0|my rating is specifically for the blu-ray disc not the film. when the 2  disc regular dvd set came out March 2007 the film was on disc#1 and all the  extras were on disc#2. when the HD-DVD came out one of the extras was   missing- the 90min. career spanning doc. about Scorsese from his first film  WHO'S THAT KNOCKING AT MY DOOR? thru THE AVIATOR. i hoped that the doc. would   be on the blu-ray disc but its missing as well. what gives if the 90min.  doc. was on the dvd why not on the blu-ray or for that matter the original  HD-DVD?
B000GCFO0S|4.0|My significant other insisted I watch this movie; I would've passed on it otherwise. I'm glad I did -- it was very well done, and appropriately creepy, disturbing etc.<br /><br />It's undeniable in its eye-candy appeal. My only criticism is that it could have been shorter, but then again, that would have detracted from the deliberately \\"videogame\\" feel of the whole thing.<br /><br />I never thought I'd be writing a positive review of a film based on a game, but there you go. Special treat: Those oddly sensual but still horrific dancing nurses! Man, what an image!
B0041OOJNU|5.0|We have all been witness to Shakira's progression from a latin music star to an international Diva, it is a tribute to her, that in doing this she has not forsaken her roots, this comes to the fore here in this CD. The CD amazes me for two reasons the quality and mix of the songs as well as its widespread appeal; all in all this is a great effort from a great singer.
0321344758|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and in addition to the information I gathered from it that I immediately began using for my clients, I really appreciated the author's easy to follow steps. Additionally his writing style made for a very fun, quick read that was miles away from a lot of the \\"textbook-type\\" books that are out there.
B0029NY9YO|4.0|Even if you aren't familiar with this as the \\"graphic comic\\" (I was not), you WILL enjoy the philosophical ponderings of this movie.      The authors had fun tweaking history and the super-hero theme, and made a great story.  NONE of it is predictable and MUCH of it addresses Thomas Sowell's \\"unconstrained vs. constrained\\" model of the 2 human visions.  If you are curious, see A Conflict of Visions.    the plot is complex (at least, that is how the details of the story unfold) and requires your undivided attention.  This story is long in ideas (and length, too) and short in \\"emotion.\\"  It's not, imho, intended to illicit emotion but thought.    And it is fun!  It has a genuine HERO character who's vastly entertaining and has a Top 10 hero quote!    It's also a little rough around the edges (see \\"graphic\\") and still a treat to watch.  Make sure you set aside plenty of time and few distractions to enjoy.
0810997827|5.0|It was hard to find a good book for my 8yr old son to read and stick with it until his friend let him read the book and he fell in love with it. I ended up buying the set and he read all of them in less then a week! One morning he woke up extra early before school and started reading! Now that's a good book! I was amazed on how much he really liked them. Some may say they are not recommeneded for younger children because the main charecter lies, is a brat, and little things like that, but my son and I do like to talk about what happens in the books and he does understand right from wrong and how to treat people. So to me I personally think it's great book to teach life lessons on.
1416585710|3.0|This is the first time I've ever not thoroughly enjoyed a Stephen King novel (or short story or novella). Because I persisted and, for me, it was worth it, I want to put the positive part of my review first.    This is a story about characters who can travel to another world, an original one that's different from any of the Dark Tower related Stephen King fantasy worlds I know about. That's one star.    The narrative IMHO founders at first, but finally finds its voice, and is inspired at times. That's 2 stars.    Legend goes that with Carrie, his first published novel, he wanted to explore writing from a female point of view. The results were a bestseller, economic security, and a brilliant career. I think he achieved his goal with 3 separate and very different teenage girls, plus the gym teacher, plus Carrie's mom, who is so nuts she's in a category if her own. In LISEY'S STORY he achieves a new goal: writing from the over-50, and in the case of Amanda and Darla, the over-60 female point of view. How often has this been done before? I think this is a terrific accomplishment for SK, and should not go unremarked. That's the third star.    As far as how to proceed reading this novel, here's what I did. When I began it I was turned off, so i came to amazon.com to see what other people thought. I found that a lot of people were disappointed, but one 5 star review by Donna Denn encouraged me to keep going. I was intrigued by mention of Lisey's mentally unstable sister Amanda, and skimming the pages for Amanda is what got me part of the way through the book. And Amanda does turn out to be crucial.    So if you're not sure whether to persist with this book, go for it. No matter how it may seem at first, there is a book you want to read in here.    Loading...
0307463745|3.0|Although it's a good book, I really was expecting far more from it. Reading their interviews, blog posts and all, I feel I wouldn't miss anything if I didn't read this book.    Most pages are just drawings and even more of them are filled out with blank spaces.    Their first book is far superior to this one.

0385342047|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella.  I've read nearly all her books and, to date, I have loved the Shopaholic series.  This time out, however, something was different.  Perhaps it was me because it surely wasn't Becky.  Actually, on second thought, maybe the problem is that nothing was different.  Becky appears incapable of even the tiniest bit of growth or change, continuing to walk blindly into the same inane situations over and over and over again.  The supporting characters (Luke, Becky's parents and their neighbors, Suze and Tarquin, etc.) are funny and enjoyable, but Becky's childish unreality overshadows the entire book.  I read lots of series books and appreciate character continuity, but this character, initially charming and quirky, has grown tiresome and frustrating.  If Becky does not learn something from her escapades this time around, I'm afraid she'll be shopping without me from now on.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|Love this album. Rihanna sounds amazing, her best vocals to date. Love the island feel of the album too. It sets her apart from the other pop divas. Just Great! Good work Riri.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Yes, I am also one of those many people that have seen the movie more times than I can remember throughout the 80's and 90's. VHS helped many rediscover one of the most important movie ever made.      Almost 10 years ago I wrote a review here about the Directors Cut of Blade Runner. But where was the original release! Moreover, where could I get the European (International) release!!!    This 5 disc set now offers that and more.     Apart from the Final Cut and the Directors Cut it also includes the 1982 US and International release. Finally. In addition, the Work Print. Then on top of that there are 2 DVD's with highly detailed and interesting background information about the movie and what went into producing it. These DVD's include interviews with just about everybody involved in the making of the movie.     For any Blade Runner fan I am sure that they will enjoy viewing these DVD's in addition to the selections of Blue Ray movie releases.     Satisfied?: Yes.
0061906220|5.0|I am a children's librarian and this one is my new favorite read-aloud. Children request it because they are able to remember the tune (from the free mp3 download) and they love to sing along with Pete. School Library Journal really didn't do this book justice in their review of this great new gem of a book.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I just love, love, love this complete series.  I was so disappointed when they discontinued the series. But I'm so happy to watch it again.    1 or 2 disc have some glitch though. Still I'm giving it 5 stars.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie led me to Temple Grandin's unique insights into human and animal thought and perception, which are staggering in their implications. Don't be fooled by the dorky cover, this DVD is exceptional in every way.    This review can't really do justice to this movie, or Temple Grandin's contributions to humankind and \\"animalkind\\". If I could give it 6 stars, I would. It deserves every award it received and will receive, and then some. In a way it's a pity it was made for TV because it (and its cast) would otherwise almost certainly have received Oscars. For some reason, \\"It won seven Oscars\\" would probably convince more people to watch it than \\"It won seven Emmys\\". Then again, maybe it *is* as good as it is because it was made by HBO. Maybe the Hollywood treatment would have ruined it - I don't know.    To me, it's not just about the production, direction, and acting, as exceptional as they are (I can't enthuse enough about how Claire Danes *becomes* Temple Grandin; it's closer to transmigration than it is to acting). It's not even just about the story, as fascinating and inspiring and important as that is. It's about how little we understand about the world in which we live, and the creatures we share it with, and a signpost to learning much more about that (through her books and other reading).    After the movie finished, I immediately watched it again, this time with the commentary track enabled, on which Temple Grandin, director Mick Jackson and co-writer Christopher Monger speak. It was a treat. Then I bought three of her books on Kindle. I read \\"Animals in Translation\\" overnight, which blew away what was left of my mind after I had watched the movie twice in a row, and I will never again think about animals in the same way.    People might consider this movie to be about autism and meeting its challenges, and it hopefully will be a huge help to the heroic parents and teachers, and other professionals in the autistic community, and of course to autistic people themselves. To those who would accompany Dr Grandin through her \\"door\\", especially the \\"neurological normals\\", it is also a portal to improving our very limited understanding of perception and reality.    As a postscript, it's got me thinking about neurodiversity and related concepts: how wide is that autistic spectrum, anyway? Could some \\"normals\\" fit into one end of it, people who don't quite fit the DSM IV definition of Asperger's, say, but are still too easily overstimulated, socially awkward, bright, sensitive, and geeky? Should autism really be called a disorder, or is it simply a different - but valid - way of perceiving reality? Is someone's \\"difficult\\", emotional, but extremely intelligent child actually very mildly autistic? Why do so many highly gifted children have difficulties coping with the \\"normals\\"?    In other words, could autism be a variation of common-or-garden brain wiring, falling into one end of the normal distribution of how people perceive reality, just as someone with a very high IQ falls into the 99.999th percentile of the IQ curve?
B003EYVXXW|3.0|As a classics major, I am a sucker for this type of movie, but I have to say that I wasn't particularly impressed by this one. The movie was often hard to follow and required a solid base of historical knowledge before even watching it. Hypatia was a fascinating woman and it is always good to see a movie made about a powerful woman in the ancient world other than Cleopatra or Livia. The movie failed to hold my attention, though - not properly introducing characters, having the explanatory text flash on the screen for at most 5 seconds with the writing in white against a pale background, and having the story be very fragmented. The acting was a mixed bag, as well, with Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, Ashraf Barhom as Ammonius, and Michael Lonsdale as Theon doing a particularly good job, but I think that the script was partially to blame for the rest. There were also strange moments like at the very end between Davus and Hypatia which are really hard to decipher. In the end, the movie read more like one you'd see in school than one you'd rent for fun.
B000E0LB7C|2.0|Although celebrated by some reviewers, I think Backhaus' box set doesn't excite the listener. Several movements are played too fast as if he had no patience or time to play (or record) them at the correct tempo marking.     As far as recording is concern, there are differences among the sessions like mics placement and reverb. On the majority of the tracks, unfortunately, the piano sounds like an old and harsh fifth rate instrument.     If you still doesn't know the Beethoven sonatas, I suggest starting from the Arrau's box set; if you're an expert and are looking for another version, check the amazing Anton Kuerti's recordings.
B0000009RX|4.0|I love Frank Zappa.  I've heard about 15 of his albums.  We're Only In It For the Money quite frankly misses the mark in a few crucial areas such as listenability and, for the songs that are actually *good*, the long-lasting replay value just doesn't hold up for those songs either so there's never a desire to listen to this stuff more than a couple times.  All the best pop songs were put on side one.  \\"Who Needs the Peace Corps?\\", \\"Concentration Moon\\", \\"Mom & Dad\\", and my personal favorite, \\"Absolutely Free\\".    Unfortunately the kind of songwriting found here is just pretty ordinary late 60's pop/rock without much in the way of replay value.  Bands attempting catchy vocal melodies and surpassing this album would be the Zombies, Love, Beatles, Rolling Stones, Kinks, Hollies, Iron Butterfly, Steppenwolf, and just about everybody else.  That's a big difference between this and Zappa's other experimental ideas (whether they be avant garde, jazzy, or Zappa's most popular one- silly and clever parodies- *these* experiments are definitely more memorable).  Albums like Weasels Ripped My Flesh, Waka/Jawaka, and Overnite Sensation give you a MUCH better idea of Zappa's overwhelming amount of creative ideas.  On We're Only In It For the Money, the vocal melodies wear out after three or four listens, and never a desire to return to them ever again in the future.  Yup, that defines We're Only In It For the Money *perfectly*.  A song like \\"Flower Punk\\", despite being more repetitive than you can possibly imagine, would have been a decent enough song by itself, but about halfway through it quickly dissolves into useless rambling, completely ruining the flow and the melody thereby ruining the song altogether.  Zappa's execution here just wasn't on the money yet.  Then you have totally pointless songs like \\"Nasal Retentive Calliope Music\\" that's basically just a bunch of noise and horribly dated filler.  \\"The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny\\" does the same exact thing and stretches it out for over 6 minutes.  Throw in \\"Are You Hung Up?\\" and that's a good 10 minutes of total chaos and pointless noodling.  Anyone who tries to convince me this is supposed to be in the same league as other Zappa albums is an opinion I simply can't understand.  Replay value is incredibly important.  Consistency and flow is as well.  This album features neither.   However for someone hearing this stuff for a first or second time, you'll hear catchy enough vocal melodies and interesting enough lyrics to enjoy it, but don't expect to have this album in your CD player very often.  Only for the diehard pop fanatics.  Update- December 31, 2011.    You know what?  I'm playing the album again and it's honestly much better than I remember, so I'm going to go ahead and bump up the rating to a 4 out of 5.  I still think there's a few clunky filler tracks (especially \\"The Chrome Plated Megaphone of Destiny\\" which is mainly annoying due to its length) but other than that, I'm impressed with the rest of the material.  Impressed AND surprised that it holds up so well.  Besides, other than Absolutely Free and Hot Rats, this is the only other worthwhile Zappa album from the 60's.  I truly can't get into Uncle Meat and Freak Out! despite how often they're cited as masterpieces by most Zappa fans (well, Freak Out! at least).
B003Z2LAAO|2.0|The 3D effects are great but the story is distracting and a bit annoying. Ok, we get it, you believe global warming is causing the rivers to dry up.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|This product is not a gimmick.  If you want a PC-like experience for FPS games on the PS3, get this now.  If you want the exact PC experience, then play on a PC.  This product will allow you to get pretty close to the PC.  I've had this for a couple of days now and I'm very satisfied.  They just upgraded to 2.0 firmware and allows you to calibrate your mouse.  I was using the FragFX v2 before this and this is much better.  I'm not even using a performance mouse.  I'm using a cheap Logitech mouse that I pulled from my desktop.  After tweaking the settings, I was able to get it just right for me.  The beauty of this product is that it allows you customize it very easily.  Not every gamer is the same so you can customize it to your needs.  As I mentioned before, if you want a PC-like experience, this is your best bet.  If you're looking for the exact PC experience, then good luck.  There is NOTHING that will ever provide that on a console unless they choose to natively support it.  This is the closest thing.  The best thing about this product is their support.  Just go to their forums and you will know that they stand behind their product and listen to their customers.
B003YOZNBK|3.0|I don't understand  WHY with all the tecnology we have, some news movies still have an unsatisfatory video quality. This is one example. Either in the good shots there are problems. The face of Megan Fox, for example,  is completely washed. I look at the fantastic restauration of \\"2001, A Space Odissey\\", a 40 years old movie, and I think that  the modern filmakers have serious visuals problems. Go to a doctor! Unless you want to kill Blu-ray!
B0031RS8NK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I've read a few books by Sophie Kinsella before and have to say I was bored by the repetitiveness (especially the Shopoholic series). This book though has changed my view a little. I couldn't put it down. I quite liked the 1920's character mixing with the 2009 character and them both sharing their lives from their own times. There were a few little things in the book that I could see coming but it wasn't until I was well in to that part of the story that I could see it. I didn't see the book ending in the way that it did either.    Nice work Sophie!
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Norah Jones' distinctive voice shines on Featuring in her collaborations with diverse artists.   Most tracks show off Ms. Jones' diverse talents beautifully as she seamlessly melds with artists such as The Foo Fighters on \\"Virginia Moon\\" and Sasha Dobson on \\"Bull Rider.\\"  A few tracks are awkward matches, like \\"Life Is Better\\" by Q Tip featuring Norah Jones, which seems to fall short of the other songs.   None the less, the CD makes for excellent background music while driving, relaxing, working or at a dinner party.   Ms. Jones does not disappoint with her new release.    I received a copy of this CD from the One2One Network to review.  This review was not edited nor influenced in any way.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I have been a fan of Josh Groban from the very beginning.  His exquisite voice has helped me through some very difficult times and has driven me to tears by it's sheer beauty.  This cd also made me cry, but for an entirely different reason.  It is bad.  Really bad.  The songs, the arrangements and yes even his vocals don't come close to meeting the standard that Josh has established in his career.  It pains me deeply to say that.    I don't profess to know what is inside Josh's head, but I have a strong feeling that he was trying to go more \\"mainstream\\" with this album.  He once said that he realizes that sometimes he will lose fans on one end and pick new ones up on the other.  I think he is sadly mistaken.  I would be very shocked if he garners any new fans based on this mediocre cd.  And what is sadder yet is the fact that these are the songs we will be hearing him perform over the next couple of years, on tour, on tv appearances and yes perhaps even on the radio.      Josh has said that he is proud of his fans and the fact that they are \\"along for the ride\\".  Sorry, but that ride has come to a screeching halt and a number of us may be leaping off.  Wait, I think I may cry again.......

The people there appeared hardened, etched into the jeans they wore, with skin that told many tales. Trips to the ocean and the carnival parks became a thing of the past.<br /><br />The little house sat on a dusty plat of land, ten acres in size, at the end of a road surrounded by sagebrush. Walls of hot dust, rocks that glimmered in the daytime, crooked telephone poles that dangled glass beads and strings of copper, peppered the landscape. I used to stare at those lines, imagining they led to treasures on the other end. The only reference point I had to my previous home was the water hole I found in the middle of a field that otherwise served as a yard of rocks.

B002VPE1AW|2.0|For those who disapprove or disagree with my review--including the producers/directors/writers of Avatar--I invite them to comment on this review.  A simple negative rating is entirely noninformative.<br /><br />For sheer special effects and entertainment value, 'Avatar' rates a full '5'.  There is no question that this film is something of a special effects masterpiece.  On the other hand, the movie is also Left/Liberal propaganda in its rankest form and is a prime example of Hollywoodheadessness.  This bias is so obvious that I've knocked a full 3 stars from this otherwise entertaining film.  I am glad to go into details.<br /><br />1.  The military [very American military] is portrayed  as the brutal destroyers of indigenous peoples i.e. the strong arm of colonialism.  It's almost as if the writers/producers are deliberately sucking up to Obama.<br /><br />2.  The 'Corporation' [make that Capitalism] is shown as Imperialist and EVIL i.e. this is fascinating in that movies and 'Avatar' are capitalist enterprises.  Then again, nobody has ever seriously argued that Hollywood is wise or politically consistent.<br /><br />3.  The blue 'Sky People' aren't really all that alien.  They are a composite of the Masai and a Plains' Indian Tribe [probably Lakota]--as such, the 'Sky People' are attitudinally less 'alien' to Western observers [you and me] than were the 'pristine' Masai/Plains' Indians.  On the other hand, the 'Sky People' do have tails.<br /><br />4.  The natives are depicted as 'at one' with their environment in ways that 'primitive' human tribes never were.  Native American tribes, for example, over-exploited game populations as soon as they acquired horses, firearms and black powder.  Their so-called 'respect' of the environment was, in truth, directly related to their relatively low populations levels and to lack of technologies of overexploit the land.<br /><br />5.  It must be emphasized that 'intelligent' beings on other worlds will be alien in ways that we can't imagine.  They won't be anything like gentle and attractive, courageous Blue People, at all.  If they as as similar to us as are jellyfish and sea urchins it will be remarkable.<br /><br />To the directors/producers/writers:  Grow Up!gentle and attractive, courageous Blue People, at all.  If they as as similar to us as are jellyfish and sea urchins it will be remarkable.    To the directors/producers/writers:  Grow Up!
1439152780|5.0|The wait was worth it for this new novel. Some of Ms. Morton's prose is so lovely that I had to stop and reread it.  Her books are unique in this century and wonderfully enjoyable for a former Victoria Holt afficianado to read. The plot was so suspenseful that I confess I skipped about 20 pages and didn't feel the plot suffered from it. I just had to reach the denouement!
B002PMV9FG|3.0|It's unfortunate that this ended up being such a disappointing installment in the series because at times it's so promising. Director David Yates definitely seems to have been the biggest fan of the books of any director who has made a HP movie, and this is incredibly well made. The amount of detail in here and the way this wizarding world is brought to life is pretty stunning. Half Blood Prince is the 4th shortest book of the series as well, which has given the filmmakers time to include almost all the major events of the book.     ...almost. Then you get to the final act, which is as big an example of \\"dropping the ball\\" I think I've ever seen. But I'll get to that. Half Blood Prince was, in my opinion, one of the least-interesting books of the series. It featured tons and tons of flashbacks and aside from that, not all that much happening. It was loaded with teen romance and honestly I can't stand that stuff. I actually give the filmmakers credit for trimming a lot of this out. We got just the right amount of Voldemort flashbacks, we got ...still a little too much romance, but it was at least not as unbearably annoying as it was in the book. Where the book Half Blood Prince amazed, though, was its ending. The last few chapters were some of the most intense, powerful, and surprising in the entire series. And unfortunately, the filmmakers seemed to have butchered them at every opportunity. Just when scenes like the one inside the cave begin to get even remotely exciting, they abruptly cut away. The scene on top of the tower totally lacked the intensity it needed, and the performances of two key actors in this scene....what were they thinking? The confrontation down at the cabin, same thing....I don't understand what the filmmakers hoped to achieve with this scene as it was shot, but it doesn't make any sense, emotionally. The story's big reveal is then handled so casually (and with no explanation whatsoever) that it's almost laughable.     A main character does diein this film, and the amount of weight this is given is almost mindbogglingly small. Again, what were they thinking?     The entire book built up to its final chapters. The movie attempts to as well, but unfortunately, this \\"final part\\" was butchered almost to the point of irrelevance. These \\"intense\\" final moments are so low-key that it almost feels like the actors are sleepwalking. Half Blood Prince is a good movie as you're watching it, and I found myself enjoying it, but then the last 15-20 minutes happen, and the movie just ends and you're left feeling, \\"....that's it?\\"
0316098337|5.0|I'm stunned.  What an amazing story.  I agree with other reviewers that it started slow and then reached a point where I simply couldn't put it down. I will be pondering it for a long time.  Bravo, Ms. Donoghue!
B0038W0OHQ|3.0|After trying my new 7H's out, people were complaining of static, and that it sounded worse than the headset I had before (5hv2's). After a bit of troubleshooting, I discovered it was the plug that connects the cord to the left earphone. even the slightest movement would cause static on the mic. Steelseries is currently replacing them, but I had to pay to ship my brand new $130 headphones to them. So, they now cost $145. How much are these things going to cost? My 5Hv2's lasted 2 years until I stepped on them no problem. Isn't 7 better than 5.something? Sigh, I guess I'll wait until I get my new pair to see, but I'm beginning to think a micro usb connector on the earpiece is a bad idea.

Like many others, I'd heard it referenced countless times as the iconic representation of mankind's dual nature, and had seen a lot of pop-culture re-tellings of the story with \\"original\\" twists added.  For anyone who thinks they know the story already, I highly recommend picking up the original and giving it a read - you might be surprised.  It's a short, easy book, is very descriptively written, and provides quite the thrill for anyone interested in the classics.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is the best workout video I've ever owned. Jillian is motivational without being gruff or syrupy sweet. What I love best is that I can get a great workout (cardio and strength training) in under 30 minutes.   Even my husband enjoys this workout. I highly recommend the 30 Day Shred to anyone who doesn't want to spend \\"hours phoning it in at the gym.\\"
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie is great. Best movie of 2010. I did not expect this to be a good movie before I watched it. Boy was I wrong. It's a non stop ride that left me exausted and happy at the same time. It's definitely an experience more than a movie. It's clever in its script and the actors all work together to make it a fresh movie experience. This could have been done wrong and been very cheesy but the clever dialog, editing and special effects along with fun actors makes this movie great. Highly reccommend this movie. You are guaranteed to lesbians this movie.
B00275EGWY|2.0|Decent movie and keeps the viewer engaged but totally unrealistic. It's a shame this movie got so much acclaim for being a realistic view of any kind of war. The three leads do everything wrong and would not last a minute in real combat. Almost every move these guy make is ensured to get somebody killed. If you know absolutely nothing about combat or technique and operating procedures (or common sense) this movie would appear to be realistic. As a work of fiction and with a fast pace and a total disregard for reality this is a very entertaining movie. To believe this is a real depiction of war is a joke. To believe the director, writer or any of the actors have really been in any kind of war is ridiculous. This film tries to be gritty and realistic but it just doesn't work. The direction and filming give it a gritty feel but he plot and actions of the main characters destroy the effect. I agree with a previous reviewer who said that the director could not have spent more than a week in Iraq. The whole concept of the movie is too unrealistic to be taken seriously. Too bad the critics are so naive about the real world and the art of war(and it's brutal truth). Good movie but not an academy award winner. Kudos to trying to make a film with an impact, too bad it turned out to be so obviously unrealistic.. All in all a major let down from all the previous reviews.
B003UYV08E|4.0|Although I heard this one wasn't as good as the 1st. one, I thought it was.  Action packed and Robert Downey Jr. was superb as usual.  I really enjoyed the movie  and will watch it again in the future.
B003EYVXSW|2.0|The special effects make Dren, the hybrid creature,  look lively and scary.<br /><br />Only the first 40 minutes are suspenseful. After that, the movie becomes insipid, and predictable. What a waste! It has the potential to become a good science fiction.
B001HN694K|5.0|This is such an imaginative and empowering movie for young girls.  I've always loved the deep murky nonsense that is Alice.  It unleashes the imagination in special way and makes one believe it is best to believe impossibles, yet perhaps (perhaps) wise to enjoy a few carefully chosen absolutes.  This Alice inspired movie was not quite what I expected (if I expected anything in particular at all), but it was a delightful surprise.  And I adore how empowering it truly IS for girls!  I still love all the princess-happily-after type stories, but they should not the only types of heroines we see or show children.  THIS Alice is such a conquering heroine, her world is so impossible while her emotions are exactly what one would expect.  If you want your little ones to \\"believe in at least 6 impossible things before breakfast\\" and slay dragons (I mean, Jaberwockies), make sure they see.  For that matter, make sure YOU see this.  (Definitely should be a hit with Narnia fans, and those few concerned with whether it's too \\"dark,\\" might note that it's pretty much on par with the more recent Narnia movies.)  Love it.
0316098337|4.0|After a long time, have I read a book that lingered in my mind and really made me think after its completion.<br />Initially a little grating, but once you come to know the essence of the book, it simply can not be put down.<br />The only thing I found totally out-of-character, and hard to absorb was Ma's action (can't let out what) after being released, not to be believable, after her strength and care portrayed in the first part. Overall she was a mature loving Ma, protecting her child, so that action was perhaps a loss of her coping mechanisms in the world.<br /><br />Jack is the true star throughout. I think several reviewers have already described him much better than I can. I also found Steppa very helpful, and who will perhaps give Jack a male support in the coming future.<br /><br />Must-read.
B001HN69AY|2.0|Oh great, another stupid movie about a girl losing her innocence.  No, wait, it's the theme of Faust.  No wait, it's a metaphor about art imitating life, or life imitating art, or whatever---oh god, it's all three.  Upon the first 15 minutes of the movie, I was so tempted to draw positive parallels with my favorite Gilliam movie, The Adventures of Baron Von Munchausen.  I tried, I really did.  Trouble is, where the good baron was supported by his own sense of wonder and imagination, this movie's own wonder and imagination gave out all too quickly.  For this writer, two themes have almost always been predominant in most of Gilliam's works.  The first is of magic of storytelling.  You see this in Time Bandits, where some of the most well-known story characters endure and take on a life of their own; even better, the Munchausen film shows us how stories can heal and even resurrect.  The second theme, is of how you can tell the measure of a person once the proverbial scales get lifted from their eyes and the truth gets revealed.  This one you see in Brazil and Fisher King and even 12 monkeys.  In this movie, stories are told, but rarely finished, and the storyteller never has anything good happen to him.  Also, despite the fact that Tony's real face, so to speak, is revealed at least 3 different times throughout the film, the fact that nobody accepts the reality of who he really is is a testament to each character's respective stupidity-and a blow to the credibility of the narrative itself.  As for said narrative, it seems like nothing more than a half-assed attempt to lazily string together barely germinated ideas for other storylines.  It is as insubstantial as the characters which have seemed to permeate Gilliams movie's as of late.  This can especially be said of the character, Valentina, who is never anything more than a prize:  soul for the devil, ownership for the father, sex for Tony-take your pick.  Ledger's death did nothing to mar the quality of this film.  It would still have been just as nonsensical as ever.  Ledger himself is decent.  In fact, the acting is above average, though I found myself getting sick of looking at Lilly Cole's face.  There was something really annoying about it.   Watch, however, for a pretty steady performance from Verne Troyer as Percy.  Is Imaginarium worth the ticket, so to speak?  In the end, the movie, like the worlds inside that mirror, is visually tempting but ultimately only half-realized.

B00012QM8G|5.0|Schinlder's List is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Set in war-torn Poland, this movie is a dark story about an unlikely hero.  Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) began a business, employing Jews who were headed for certain death in the concentration camps during World War II.  Schindler belongs to the Nazi party and starts off thinking of only the money he can make using Jewish people to make pots and pans for the German military.  By the end of the war, Schindler, the the help of his Jewish accountant (Ben Kingsley), he saves 1100 Jews from death in concentration camps.  He spent every dime he made to employ Jews at a munitions factory, which was a cover for the safe-haven he was truly offering.    To me, the part of the movie that really drove the message home was the little girl in the red coat.  So many times, when movies about the Holocaust are presented, all we as the audience see are masses of faceless, nameless people.  One little girl in red coat, which was the only color in the entire film, struck out at me, challenging \\"Do you see me? I am an individual.\\"  This one little scared girl, running to hide, put all the horror and tragedy into perspective.    This movie gives us a brief, powerful glimpse of the struggles of European Jews during World War II and the heroism of one man that risked his life to save so many others.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|I was not really a Josh Groban fan to begin with; however, a member of my family is, and I was dragged (kicking and screaming) to one of his concerts on the \\"Closer\\" tour back in 2003. Hearing him live, I was hooked, and I've followed his subsequent releases with interest.     For this release, much more of Josh's original writing is included than on previous albums. To some extent, this has produced a rather different feel in the way of music, and apparently (judging from the reviews I'm seeing here) it is not to the tastes of some. It took me a couple of listens-through to figure it out. However, the effort has produced some delightful pieces. \\"Bells of New York City\\" has easily become my favorite Groban song of all time, just ahead of \\"You Are Loved\\" from his Awake album, and \\"Remember When It Rained\\" from Closer. I'm also extremely impressed with \\"War At Home\\", a song co-written with the incredible Hollywood composer James Newton-Howard. \\"Galileo\\" and \\"Hidden Away\\" are also standout and stunning songs. The introductory piece (instrumental only) was written by Josh when he was very young, and has an Irish-folk feel that would feel right at home in portions of the Riverdance soundtrack - it's different, but impressive. It's authentic Josh. Last but not least, \\"Você Existe Em Mim\\" is a very impressive song (sung in Portuguese) that would be a fantastic start to the show on tour.    Since the release of his \\"Closer\\" album, Josh's voice has been undergoing significant training, and has matured and changed dramatically from his first two studio-recorded albums. Some of these songs, as a result, are sung in a much higher and broader range than some of his previous material. So it does sound different at times than his voice did before, but that is certainly not unexpected for someone undergoing tremendous vocal training.    Personally, I think that Josh should be careful not to stray too far from his roots in the months and years ahead, as some other artists have donethrough the years to their detriment. At the same time, there is always the possibility of becoming stale and repetitive. Within these two boundaries, there is a great deal of room for exploration, and I believe this album is a very nice expansion on his previous material. It's fresh, it's interesting, and it's different - but not so different to make the average open-minded listener clap their hands over their ears and run screaming from the room. The fantastically negative reviews I'm finding are a true shocker, and are - in my opinion - an extreme over-reaction to an exploration of Josh's boundaries.    Kudos to Josh for exploring some interesting directions, and for providing a fresh and interesting album. Where can I get my ticket for the tour? :)

Keith has turned Toto on us and ripped the curtain away,exposing the Wizard and all his virtues.  I sort of would rather have the myth back,but am grateful for the reality.  If Richards ever kicks it,let's hope for humanity's sake his DNA is put away for safekeeping as it must contain certain keys to longevity in spite of 45 years of various chemical toxins being thrown at it-and the man keeps on chooglin'...

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I just finished reading this thrilling book that kept me thoroughly absorbed. I learned more about Greek mythology, but especially the lesser known Roman myths. Allowing us, the readers, to understand all three of the main characters by switching narratives every few chapters also adds to this book's allure. Rick Riordan does not disapoint so enjoy!
B003BWERF8|4.0|The first one I got had a problem remembering the devices it was paired to. I requested a return from the company because that was a pain to deal with. But the company told me it wasn't supposed to work that way and the sent me a new one, asking me to return the old one at my convenience. The new one does remember pairings and works great.<br /><br />I also own the one Sony makes and frankly this one is more convenient since you don't have to turn it on after plugging it in. It's also a bit smaller than the Sony. Sound quality compared with the Sony is about the same and is quite good. This unit will let you change volume at the iPod where the Sony will only output the max, but I don't find that to be a useful feature as you will want it set to max in almost all cases. I have Bluetooth on the car radio and I can stream audio to it from this easily. I can also use it with my Bluetooth Nokia headphones so I don't have to deal with those headphone wires. Works with both my 5th gen and 6th gen Nano perfectly.

B00001OH7P|2.0|This album has always been over-rated. Bowie only had 3 or 4 decent songs from the 70's  (Fame, Golden Years,Changes). Most of his stuff from that era was just glam garbage that appealed mostly to British teens who couldn't seem to get enough of all those self-absorbed, self-important and mostly over-rated glam acts like T-Rex, Slade, The Sweet, Sparks and Gary Glitter. Most of Bowies albums from the 80's are FAR superior!
B000NVIXFK|2.0|Concerning RUSH's last three studio recordings, Test For Echo, Vapor Trails and Snakes & Arrows ..... I just don't get it. It all sounds like a bunch of noise to me. Counterparts is the last recording I really liked by them overall ..... I guess that makes me a classic RUSH fan only at this point in time. The only reason I gave this recording two stars was out of the respect for the great musicians they are and the outstanding live shows they still perform today.
1600242405|4.0|As I read the early chapters of Life I found tears streaming down my face. It was as if I was reading about my late mother.  I was born in England in 1963.  The music, towns, food, weather but most of all the attitudes of post war England are so accurate. I have never read anything like it.  Things I had forgotten about my early childhood were suddenly awakened.     \\"Life\\" drills down to what has made The Rolling Stones the greatest band ever.  In spite of their wild ways their priority was the essence and purity of their music.  I am no \\"muso\\" but reading \\"Life\\", I get it.    Read the book but do not dilute this fantastic read with the audiobook.  No offence to Johnny Depp but the book needed a true Londoner to narrate.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Most of the criticism comes from those who love the book series and for when this television is a travesty. Well, it's not high art, but it is a fun fantasy television show with better characters than is common for American network television.
B001UV4XHY|2.0|I am immune to the appeal of the Harry Potter phenom. I try to watch the films every now and then to see if I can get a handle on what all the fuss is about. It still eludes me. I was bored through this movie, with one scene standing out as engaging and interesting and having some magic, some sparkle. Obviously, mine is not the majority view.<br /><br />I find Daniel Radcliffe frighteningly cute. He's just a child! Scary. The scene where several Harrys remove their shirts at once - wow. Hand me my fan.<br /><br />Ralph Fiennes is one of the all-time great film actors. He does evil very well - see \\"Schindler's List.\\" Here he is wearing some kind of CGI no-nose Halloween mask and he doesn't raise so much as one goose pimple. Fiennes could have made this villain, Voldemort, really scary if they had removed the silly make-up/cgi. As it is, you look at him and think, poor guy, some kind of no-nose birth defect. It would be unkind to stare. Hire the differently abled!<br /><br />I had no idea what was going on for most of the movie. I'd read a review saying that Hermione had to erase her family's memories of her, and that that was very poignant. That happens in an opening scene that lasts about a minute. Had I not read the review, I would have had no idea what was happening. Whatever was happening was not poignant to this viewer.<br /><br />I didn't, and still don't, know what a horcrux is. Characters have magical powers, but which characters have which powers? Voldemort wants to kill Harry; Voldemort has magical powers. Why doesn't Voldemort just use his magical powers to kill Harry? What's preventing him? I have no idea, because I don't know how magical powers are apportioned, or resisted, in this world. There's scene after scene of wands and chases and searches and I never knew what anyone could do with what spell or wand, so I didn't know what was at stake and what needed to be done to protect what was at stake. At one point Ron tells Harry \\"It's about more than you.\\" What is it about? Box office revenue.<br /><br />There's a scene where Harry is caught under ice, alone in a forest at night: a real claustrophobe's paranoid nightmare. I found I could watch the scene without any anxiety. Now that's poor filmmaking.<br /><br />There is so much stuff slathered onscreen: eccentric English cottages with floating pears growing outside the front door, magical tents, protective snowy owls, elevators that travel sideways - and I never once said \\"Oooo\\" or \\"Aaaa\\" (except for that scene where multiple Harrys bear multiple post-adolescent, nicely muscled, newly hairy chests - ooo baby). Nothing felt magical to me. The ever present onscreen junk all had the same, loud, tacky, K-Mart Christmas feel. \\"Less is more\\" anyone?<br /><br />There was one scene that worked. I was caught up in it, and, even as I was watching it, I imagined legions of fangirls watching this scene again and again once the home version is released. Harry and Hermione are feeling low. They are alone in a tent in a forest. Music is playing on a staticky radio. The camera focuses on Hermione in the glow of a kerosene lamp. Suddenly, the view of Hermione is blocked by Harry's sweater-clad shoulder. In the same way that he is blocking the scene, he is overwhelming Hermione's consciousness. He extends his hand to her; she rises; they dance, their bodies directed by their despair, their hunger for intimacy with each other, and their fear that satisfying that desire is not a wise idea. It's a truly magical scene, and all too brief. And it required no special effects, just young people you care about who are trying to thrive, as all of us do, through contact, music, art, and dance, in a life-or-death situation.e revenue.

B003JSSPSY|5.0|The first season moved along relatively slowly, but had some character development. With the second season, the pace is up, the action is up as well. Fun show with most of the negative comments being from fans of the book series who disagreed with the very significant differences between the television show and the books. Kara, the Mord Sith, is a great addition to the main set of characters. More often than not being the voice of simplicity, if not reason. The series was not renewed so this is end for the show.

B0040YFR1Y|2.0|I'm going to leave the review of the movie itself to others.  I'll merely point out that this particular BD does not play well with many BD players.  Of the three BD players I have, it won't play in two of them, even after firmware upgrades.  It's not just the disc I bought, as I returned it and the second one does exactly the same thing...nothing.  The player reads the BD a little bit (just enough to give you the first warning message) and then stops dead in the water.  One of my friends had exactly the same epxerience (both of us have an older Sony BDP-S350), but it also wouldn't work in a newer LG.  Very frustrating and a waste of money.

0385335997|5.0|This is the 3rd in the unique and wonderful Scottish historical (and time travel) series that grabs you by the throat and won't let you go. At over 1000 pages, this installment is an all day sucker of historical romance and well worth your time.<br /><br />The saga of Claire and Jamie continues in VOYAGER as Claire, who by 1968 has become an MD and is now chief of staff of a prominent Boston hospital, having discovered that Jamie did not die at Culloden in 1746, learns more about Jamie's hard life since they were forced apart 20 years ago. She is assisted in her research in Scotland by Roger Wakefield, an Oxford scholar and a Scot who is attracted to Claire's beautiful daughter, Brianna, the physical image of her father, Jamie. As the three conduct their research into the past, we become a part of Jamie's life during the years he did not have Claire. As life throws him one difficult challenge after another (living as an outlaw in a cave, prison, a servant in a rich man's house, manipulation and abuse by others, etc.), he remains a man of honor and integrity with a heart to serve and provide for those he loves, all the while longing for his lost love and the child she bore him he has never seen.<br /><br />Claire longs to rejoin Jamie in the past though she knows another passage through the standing stones to go back 200 years in time carries great risk. It is a risk she is willing to take because he is her heart.<br /><br />This is a well-told tale of a deep love that spans centuries and of the two lives deeply woven into the tapestry of Scotland's history. This is the only romance series I know of where the same romance flourishes in each book...it is a tribute to Gabaldon's outstanding talent as a storyteller, one who sees into the hearts of people, that she can make it captivating. You want Jamie and Claire's love to go on forever.<br /><br />This book had me both laughing out loud and crying tears as it ripped at my own heart. I highly recommend it.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|Just watched the extended collector's edition on my Samsung BD-C6500. Worked fine, one tiny little oddity: at three points during the film, the pause menu graphic popped up on its own (scene label, timeline, etc) and the movie kept playing. Menu went away after a couple of seconds. This behavior happened consistently at the same places (I tested it after finishing the movie). Took a moment to upgrade the player's software, problem vanished.     As far as the collection itself-WONDERFUL, for all the reasons many of the other reviewers have noted. I was one of the people who passed on the original blu-ray release, because I had read this one was in the works. Well worth the wait.

B003YWUTJI|4.0|Featuring Norah Jones is a compilation of duets and collaborations recorded between 2001-2010. I really enjoyed this album, which I received from One2One. It's always great to hear fine musicians working together, and the diversity showcased is impressive. Individual songs feature everyone from musical icons like Dolly Parton, Ray Charles, Willie Nelson and Herbie Hancock to younger musicians like Foo Fighters and Outkast.     Jones has a distinctive voice, and I appreciate her range and versatility. There's jazz, country, a bit of hip-hop, bluesy numbers, and creative reinterpretations of songs such as Court & Spark and Baby, It's Cold Outside. My favourite cuts so far are Loretta and Turn Them, lyrically strong with lovely instrumental backing. Well worth a listen.

B0007KTBIU|4.0|The big box store had already discontinued this title and I wanted it to go with a Pocahontas doll for my granddaughter. It came quickly and in good shape. Haven't watched it yet but I'm sure it will be in great condition when we get around to it!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|I've been using this arm for over a year now with a 24\\" Asus VW246H panel and I can't imagine being without it. It saves so much desk space it is ridiculous and it's nice to be able to just swing the entire thing out of the way when you need to. When I first purchased this I thought it would be shaky and would eventually bow under the weight, but it doesn't - it's much more solid than expected, regardless of how you have it positioned.    I spend a lot of time at my computer and this just makes it that much more pleasant. I only wish I had another set so I could turn one vertically for reading long documents.
0525951652|4.0|Fall of Giants Ken Follett<br />4 stars<br /><br />Ken Follett is on a winning streak. The first installment of his planned Century Trilogy is well worth the time and money to read its 900 + pages (or listen, as I did for 31 hours). Beginning just before the outbreak of WW1, the book follows five international families through the war and its immediate aftermath. This is Follett. The writing is functional, not great literature, but never-the-less compelling. The characters are contrived to be in the best locations to present the significant social and political developments of the era. Unlike his medieval books, none of the main characters are presented as being totally evil. He chooses flawed, but well-meaning personalities to illustrate how the giants of the class system were responsible for the extended carnage of the war. This book worked best when Follett was moving his characters around the playing board of world history to look at events from different vantage points. The love stories of the players were less interesting to me. I felt that the characters were being paired up so that a required amount of sex could be added to the story. I felt very little real emotion in these relationships and just wanted him to get on with the events of the story. The set-up for the next book in the series is very clear. I hope it won't be too long before it hits the shelves.

0345505387|2.0|The Exile - Diana Gabaldon<br />2 stars<br /><br />It sounded like a good idea. Make a graphic novel with the characters from the very popular Outlander series. The pre-released artist renderings of the characters were very intriguing. The author promised to tell the beginning of the existing story from a different perspective and hinted at a new plot line. Gabaldon should have known better. The original book has several pages of delightful interaction between Jaime and his young cousin. They talk of horses, women, and the birds and bees. In Exile, this wonderful relationship is reduced to a thought bubble over the head of a generic child, \\"Jaime is my hero.\\"  The mysterious new plot element is a meaningless ploy to insure that reader's return to the series. I'm already a fan; I didn't need to be manipulated. The only real excuse for this project is of course the art.  I don't know much about graphic novels, but I am a big fan of picture books. These drawings did nothing for me. I could not distinguish one character from another. They did not in any way capture the atmosphere of the books for me. Such a disappointment.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|Except when it takes itself a little too seriously, this is a fun show, especially since the local high school and the surrounding community has the highest concentration of incredibly beautiful people in the world.
B003YWUTJI|3.0|While I love that this disc is full of duets I was not impressed with a lot of the songs. Some of them just seem to fall short of bringing me into the moment of the song. While there were a few good tracks on this disc I feel like Norah could have cut those few tracks and had a cd out well before 10 years. And like I said I like that there were duets on here I feel like her talents stand out better alone. IF you are just looking for a nice quiet and calm sound this is a great cd. If you want anything else look elsewhere.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I love Josh Groban, but Im sorry this cd is totally flat to me. The songs never take off, there is not one song that is memorable, and each one sounds the same on the same level. His vocals don't seem like they use to be, I dont know what it is but sadly I have to say its a dissapointing album, I tried so hard to like it but find it very difficult to listen to especially one of the tenor pieces.
B000I9X50U|1.0|I'm going to keep this short, since I've already wasted five bucks and over two hours of my life on this turkey.  This is at best, a mildly annoying, non-funny chick flick, with no real romantic interest and an almost nonexistant plot.  At worst (which is how I experienced it), it is the most boring, uninteresting, sex-less (yes, I don't count the cheesy 30-second, fully clothed dry-humping scene as a \\"sex\\" scene) piece of theatrical crap I've seen in decades.  Whoever wrote this script should either be run out of the country, or else be banned from writing for life.     Not only is this \\"film\\" bereft of any artistic value, I would also note that for guys there is nary a breast nor even bare butt in the whole two-hour-plus snooze-fest, to appeal to our prurient interests.  And for the gals, there's absolutely no charisma or true love interest in any of these flat-scripted characters: only boredom and ennui will engulf you.    In short, I've seen 30-second TV commercials with far more entertainment value than this meaningless tripe. Don't rent it, and God help you if you are foolish enough (like me) to buy this complete waste of celluloid.
B003Z39G0O|5.0|Hardest thing to find, found on Amazon!! I love this CD soo much. It came soo fast!! and in perfect condition!!!
B002RSDW80|5.0|I had to drag my husband to this movie ... but he reluctently admitted that he enjoyed it.  We both agreed that by the end of the movie you honestly believed that you were watching Julie Child. Meryl Streep did an incredible acting job.  I could watch this over and over again.  If you haven't seen this ... don't hesitate!  It actually inspired me to get out on old copy of Mastering the Art of French Cooking and try the Beef Bourguignon recipe (it turned out great)!
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I have never read the books, and have only one comment.  To me a PG movie should not be this scary.  In my mind.  PG means most kids ages 8-12 should be fine watching it.  I personally found of so scary in the first 20 minutes that I turned it off.  Maybe I'm just wierd, but I thought this review ought to be in here, in case other parents are as protective of their children (or themselves) as I am.  I thought it should have been rated PG-13.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks' novels have gotten so popular I tend to find myself reading them like a screenplay of which this will surely become.  I love his books, the flawed characters and most of all the Carolina coastal settings.  This book will not disappoint...
B004BLJQOK|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful movie, but some of the strongest reasons for watching the movie have not been fully extolled, so please read this review.  It may be of help to you.    The other people who earlier wrote reviews of Let Me In have more than sufficiently explained the story of the movie, as well as eloquently explained its excellences, so I won't bother repeating what has already been so well provided (and I don't consider any of the following to be true spoilers, as most of the movie is fairly predictible, and that is not a fault in this case).  However, if you are one of the readers who have read those reviews and despite learning of the brilliances of the casting, the cast in general (Kodi is GREAT), the cinematography and the superlative direction, and yet you still did not see the movie (which has left the theaters at the time of this writing), then there are yet other reasons to consider getting the DVD/Blu-Ray, and they are among the most powerful.  The vampire herself, and the actress who plays her, and how they create such incredibly contrasting and opposing emotions in the viewer.  THIS is really what makes this film so fresh, and why it MUST be viewed...repeatedly.    As you may have already absorbed, Abby is a petite, 12 year old vampire girl.  Of course (as Abby herself explains), she has been 12 for a very---long---time.  The thing is....not only is she physically stuck at 12, but she is also mentally and emotionally stuck at 12.  So despite how long she has inhabited the Earth, and despite all the experiences she has lived through, she still has the attitudes, likes, and responses of a 12 year old girl.  And this makes her different from any vampire that has preceded her (and arguably more interesting).  This difference begins in the music that introduces her (kudos to Michael Giacchino).  Whenever the magnificent Christopher Lee has played Dracula (a truly foul, soulless monster who honestly enjoys his killing), Dracula's presence is accompanied by extremely ominous and evil music.  There's no doubt what kind of \\"person\\" he is.  But the first time that a viewer sees Abby, she is accompanied by the blissfully pure sound of boy sopranos......it is the kind of gorgeous sound that we normally associate with angels, and Our Father in Heaven.  And yet, THIS is the kind of music that accompanies....the vampire.  Right away, something is different.  Right away, the entire rest of the movie has been cannily set up.  And the viewer wonders, \\"How can such a creature be accompanied by music that is so............sweet?\\".  They don't know the half of it, but \\"sweet\\" IS the right word.    Abby has no wish to take someone else's life.  But as she also simply explains, \\"I need blood.......to live\\".  Like all living creatures, she wants to survive, she doesn't want to die.  Unfortunately (and according to the book), she can't follow the lead of the Cullens, or Stefan Salvatore.  She MUST have blood that has just come out of a living human being.  If the blood comes from any other source (no bunnies for her) or is not fresh (no hospital blood for her), it will not nourish her, it will actually be harmful to her.  Therefore, innocent people must be brutally murdered in order for her to continue living.  Either Abby herself must attack such innocent people (and her attacks are VIOLENT in both sight and sound)......or someone must do the killing for her.      A man (somewhat middle-aged......sorry, Mr. Jenkins) lives with Abby.  For years (and once every few days), he goes out into the night and attacks a person and drains their blood while they are unconscious but still alive.  He then takes the blood to Abby for her to consume....and this has been going on for a long time.  After a movie viewer sees such an attack, they can't help but wonder, \\"How can he do something so horrible, so cruel, so deliberate and of his own volition.....for a vampire?\\".  No, he is not compelled....at least, not the way the Salvatores do it.  But in a way, he feels compelled to perform these ghastly acts nonetheless.  This will be explained.     When Abby attacks and drinks blood, not only is it violent, but she actually looks.....well.......\\"like a vampire\\".  But at almost all other times, she is the most...........adorable, loveliest, sweetest (and yes, she deserves the boy soprano music) 12 year old girl you could ever imagine.  Well, not at first because: 1) someone in her \\"occupation\\" needs to be wary, and 2) most people are grouchy when they are hungry, and Abby suffers hunger very painfully.  Other than these exceptions, she is indeed absolutely angelic.  If you don't have a daughter, she will make you wish you had one, even if you never have before.  She is SO adorable that you can't help but fall in love with the young lady.  Even though you know what she is.  Even though you know what she does.  Even though you've seen her brutally murder innocent people right in front you.  You will still come to care for her.  There is a scene (later in the film) where a bit of sunlight strikes her leg, and she naturally starts to fry immediately.  I heard people in the theater GASP!  They were worried for her, they were concerned for her, they wanted to protect her, they had come to care for her.  Even though they knew what she is.  Even though they knew what she does.  Even though they had seen her brutally murder innocent people right in front of them.  They couldn't help caring for her because even though she performs the acts of an inhuman monster, Abby is THAT adorable.  And what makes her that adorable....is the performance of the wonderful and magical Chloe Grace Moretz.  Yes, I imagine the insightful direction of Matt Reeves had a lot to do with that, but it is still the angelic (yes, that's the word) face, personality and performance of Chloe Grace that makes viewers fall in love with a creature that performs utterly reprehensible and terrible acts.  The viewers just can't help themselves (and this reaction is magnified upon repeated viewings).  And once this happens, only THEN can it be understood how a man could spend his life with her.....killing innocent people.  He had fallen irrevocably in love with her when he was young.  And by the end of the movie, it seems likely that there have been others that have done so in the past...and there will be others afterward.  Yes, I imagine it still seems impossible to you, the reader.  After all, Abby's last visible act of the movie is tremendously horrible.  And yet, it is also ultimately and characteristically good-hearted.....at the same time.  Once you have experienced the utter magic that Chloe Grace puts into Abby, you may understand.  Either Chloe Grace is a truly wonderful young lady, or she is a mind-bogglingly talented actress.  Her other movies and her vlogs and interviews suggest.....it's a little of both.    It is regrettable that the natural end of life is death.  And it is regrettable that the wonderful actors and actresses with whom we've grown up and with whom we've spent our lives are passing away, one by one.  Each time this happens (especially to the truly greatest ones), it leaves a gaping hole in our hearts because we've lost an old friend and a great entertainer, but it also makes us wonder if such a loss will detrimentally affect the acting industry.  Well, after seeing Let Me In numerous times, I no longer have any worries.  The performance of Chloe Grace makes it abundantly and wonderfully clear that the future of the acting industry is as bright as a supernova.  Indeed, it is as bright.....as this young supernova.      SO.......when they come out, it is suggested that you buy the DVD or Blu-Ray, and play it on the best audio/video system you can find.  Be prepared to fall in love with a vampire AND the magical actress who has cinematically given both Abby and herself............immortality.

B003DZX44I|5.0|I won't even begin to talk about the plot, because it's a \\"tale old as time\\" (yeah I had to say it). I will however talk about how great the picture quality is on Blu-ray.  I could only describe it as a \\"moving painting\\" and a rather bright and vivid painting at that.  The audio is equally as good as the video which is really saying a lot.    There are 3 versions of the film included on the BD and DVD, as well as a ton of bonus material.  The bonus material includes a lot of featurettes on the plot, music, etc. and some games for children.    Bottom line this is the best version of the movie ever released, and a must purchase before it goes back into the Disney Vault.  Can't wait to see how great The Lion King turns out on Blu-Ray next year!
0743246616|5.0|This book is a delightful compilation of childhood classics with a twist...the pumpkin pie has bourbon. All of my Thanksgiving baking is from this book, including the pumpkin and apple pie, and the pumpkin cheesecake with gingersnap crust. The nectarine pie and the strawberry double-crust pies are also outstanding. You may have to adjust the measurements on some recipes, like reducing the amount of butter for making graham cracker crust, or adding more softened butter and less flour to make pie crust. Skip the disappointing cupcakes at the NYC bakery, and buy this book instead. All recipes are simple and reliable.
0375851569|5.0|All the books are superbly written and fun to read. His writing style is amazing, rhymes are clever, memorable and challenging...Overall, the books are classic, creative and captivating...
0684859106|5.0|Full of nostalgic and reliable childhood classics with a slight twist on the originals. None of the recipes are trendy or innovative, making this collection appealing to most any crowd. My favorites in this book include the key lime pie with gingersnap crust, the chocolate amaretto bundt cake, the lemon vanilla bundt, the lemon curd, and the infamous dump cake. The recipes are fairly easy and basic tips are given. Most recipes come out perfect on the first try, but I have had to adjust some of the quantities of ingredients, like reducing the amount of melted butter used to make a graham cracker crust. Ironically, the bakery is horrible, but this cookbook is a winner.

B0034G4OVS|4.0|Although a bit slim on plot, the premise is what would happen if people wound up stuck on a ski lift that was presumed empty and closed down for the week. More a survival story than a \\"horror\\" film per se  it still manages to offer some chills.  It's well directed, well acted and centered in reality. The gore usually associated with teens in jeopardy was thankfully left in the cutting room . (One scene is included as a \\"deleted\\"  scene for those who'd prefer it.)Worth a look.
B0011Z7KGK|1.0|Personal preference is everything in music. Nickelback's performances all sound the same to me. Their harmony is grating to my ears. It reminds me of cats fighting. If you like their music then please disregard my comment. If you aren't familiar with their music, tread carefully before purchasing.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|I give this movie 5 stars because I was at the edge of my seat the entire movie. For anybody who has snowboarded or skied, the topic always comes up about how would you get off the lift if you were stuck. This movie goes through this whole scenario. It puts you on that ski chair, at night, knowing that nobody will be there to save you. It does a very good job at it, and throws out many situations that could happen.    I think the negative reviews comes from the fact that many people want to movie to seem as real as possible. There were many things that went wrong, which would seem to be impossible for it all to happen in real life. However, you have to understand that the directors wanted the movie to be interesting and to throw in many horror situations.    Since you really feel for the characters, you will sit back and say why don't they do this, or why did they do that. Like when they let their faces be exposed to the cold instead of covering up. But you have to understand, they could not make a movie where they had their faces inside their jackets the whole time. The director had to make obvious decisions to make the movie more appealing.    I simply just overlooked these negatives because I understand why they were chosen.
B000SEGQNS|4.0|I love this book, obvious stuff sometimes but great to know why we do what we do in our designs.  Some suggestions are new to me and very helpful.  As i read each chapter, i redesign a part of my website!  Only drawback is the pictures are fuzzy, even when enlarged and they often contain text
B002ZG99CC|4.0|If you want almost an exact replica of \\"The Karate Kid\\" you will like this movie.  I felt that they should have changed some things in it, but it's basically just the same exact storyline as the first Karate Kid.  It's basically like a Civil War Re-enactment, there's different people acting out the exact same thing that happened in the past.  Don't get me wrong it's a good movie, but the first Karate Kid is still way better just because it has Danielson.
B004TRJRD6|5.0|The King, or should I say, Queen of horror movies. Still as potent today as when I watched it in a theater in 1973.<br /><br />Very doubtful they could make this film today as it is, & get an R rating. Not in this political correctness age. NC 17, just for the masturbation with a crucifix & then Regan pushing her mothers face to her vagina saying, \\"lick me!\\" Then there would probably be groups protesting the movie by the dozens. \\"The Exorcist exists the way it is because of a grandfather clause, from a time more permissive in Cinema.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks & sounds great! The movie never looking or sounding better. There is grain in the film, but that is more to how it was filmed & it's age, than anything technological of today.<br /><br />Highly recommend the upgrade!<br /><br />5 Stars = Masterpiece
B0040JHWKS|4.0|Having now heard the bulk of Springsteen's output from his recording interregnum (1975-78), I think it's pretty clear that Springsteen picked a fantastic collection of 10 songs for \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town,\\" and I think it is equally clear that there was a \\"substantial\\" bit left behind. If you combine the best of \\"The Promise\\" with a couple of the songs from the sessions that made it onto Tracks, you'd probably have a single album that rivaled both \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\" in quality.    There is a slight letdown here, in that some of the best songs (The Promise, Fire, Because the Night, Rendezvous) have a fairly substantial live history. Springsteen's music is almost always better live; there was simply no way that a studio version of \\"Fire\\" or \\"Because the Night\\" could rival his live performances of those songs from his 1978 tour.    When listening for a second time, though, I tried to put myself into early 1978, having heard his earlier albums and Born to Run, but without knowing where his career would lead. I like to think I would have said, \\"These guys can take on ANY style of music.\\" We sort of knew that from the way his later career developed, but I would not have known that in the mid-to-late 1970s, when this would have come out. On those terms, this is one of his better albums. (I would rank it behind only Darkness, Born to Run, and the perpetually-underrated The Wild, The Innocent, and the E-Street Shuffle.)    Lastly, I have no problem with his additional work on the songs. You can definitely hear some of the additional work he did (compare the different Springsteen voices on \\"Wrong Side of the Street,\\" or the background vocals on \\"Gotta Get that Feeling,\\" and they will remind you a lot of what he was doing on \\"Magic\\"), but I think it probably helped fill out the album a bit.
B00428ZRFE|1.0|Not a good follow-up to \\"Rated R\\".  \\"Loud\\" by Rihanna has only one flavour and that flavour is nasty.  \\"Rated R\\" was much more creative and had better writers and producers involved.  I don't know who was responsible for \\"Loud\\" but it just doesn't work.  All of the songs are generic and repetative.  I didn't like not one song on here, most of them are skip-overs and only warrant one listen and you're through.  I can't believe Rihanna went from a 5 star album like Rated R, to this.  The pictures in the liner notes are about the only attractive aspect of this horrible cd  I ended up pawning my copy of Loud today and just listened to Rated R instead.  I think Rihanna and her team didn't really spend enough time on her latest release.  She needs to go back to the drawing board and work with better writers and musicians nest time around.

B00117QA1Y|4.0|This season is starts off one of the best tv series for the CW. The main story line for all seasons starts here and going back to watch it all over again it keeps to the main theme. However the music for this entire season sucks compared to the latter ones. I don't know what they were thinking with the choices but otherwise the acting and the story are great enough and even if the music doesn't compliment the moment. Maybe the dvd set will contain the original music like the other reviewer said.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah Jones \\"Featuring\\" is a true smorgasbord for the senses. I've been a fan of Norah Jones' cool voice and jazzy pop stylings and was thrilled to see so many great collaborations of hers over the past decade with many of her favorite artists.<br /><br />These collabs are so diverse that it truly makes for an exciting and fascinating album. I love the differing genres and the interpretations. I especially like the cover of Joni Mitchell's \\"Court and Spark\\" with the brilliant Herbie Hancock, which is moody and jazzy.<br /><br />There is everything from rock (Foo Fighters, Ryan Adams) to hip-hop (Q-Tip, OutKast_ to country (Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson) to jazz (Herbie Hancock).<br /><br />\\"It's so exciting and flattering and fun when I get asked to sing with somebody that I admire,\\" Norah has said. \\"It takes you a little bit out of your comfort zone...kind of like being a little kid and having a playdate.\\"<br /><br />There are none I don't like and some I love! I love \\"Turn Them\\" with Sean Bones and its reggae feel. \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" is such a classic with Willie Nelson. It's such a great fit like a comfortable pair of worn-in-jeans. \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Ray Charles is playful and gorgeous. It surprised me that Norah was so natural with hip hop. She shines with Q-tip in \\"Life is Better\\" and with Talib Kewll.<br /><br />This cd really has something for everyone. It's like a favorite mixtape and is great for driving or just lazing on a Sunday afternoon. \\"Featuring\\" shows off Norah's talent and charm, her versatility and her smoothness. It's eclectic, funky and fun.

B002VECMAE|4.0|This film is a comedic adaptation to a bestselling non-fiction book by British author Jon Ronson. As the story begins, we find Ann Arbor, Michigan newspaper journalist Bob Wilton (Ewan McGregor) - who is also the movie narrator - on the brink of divorce and in a mode of self-pity. Looking to seek adventure and prove himself, both as a man to his separating wife, and as a writer, he decides to fly to Kuwait to report a big story from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in early 2003. However, he soon runs into an eccentric ex-special forces agent named Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), who claims he had been engaged in covert activities for the U.S. military since the 1980s. But Bob soon finds out Lyn is not talking about typical spying and espionage like most people would first think of - no, Lyn's special unit was trained by Vietnam commander-turned-hippie radical Bill Django to develop psychic powers that might replace weapons and make for a kinder, gentler armed forces who defeat their enemies with the power of the mind. Their experiments in trying to develop these new powers included - you guessed it - the use of goats. Though Bob isn't quite able to tell if Lyn is mentally disturbed or a psychic genius, he nevertheless convinces Lyn to let him travel with him to Iraq to be in the middle of things as the war begins.<br /><br />While Bob and Lyn travel together, Lyn often flashes back and tells stories of his training by Django and his New Earth Army, including introducing the character of Larry Hooper (Kevin Spacey), someone jealous of Lyn and always out to undermine the mission of the new unit. Early into their travels, Bob and Lyn are attacked by renegade fighters out to sell prisoners to Al-Qaida fighters, and while help captive Bob and Lyn discover their \\"Jedi Warrior\\" connection. Lyn is able to get them out of the tough spot, but seemingly leads them on a mission to nowhere until stumbling upon what it is they were supposed to find and destroy - a new Hooper-led U.S. unit of \\"imposter Jedis\\" conducting business in a manner that flies directly in the face of everything the NEA stood for. Bill - now seemingly working for the \\"Dark Side\\" - and Bob work together to sabotage the new unit and keep the spirit of their old squad alive.<br /><br />The story is set in the early stages of the U.S. invasion of Iraq in early 2003, and makes many references to some of the actual headlines to come from the war, including terrorist attacks and U.S. prisoner abuse. The concept of alluding to real events in the course of telling the larger \\"fiction\\" part of the story is at the core of the historical fiction genre. While the story is inspired from a nonfiction book of facts regarding the war and the secret military program, the screenplay writers certainly take liberty with most of the actual facts and people involved, a trait commonly seen in this genre. The movies portrays the time period well, cleverly crafting some social and political commentary that existed at the time into the plot. It also provides for an accurate historical detail relating to custom, beliefs, society, culture, both of Americans taking part in the war effort and the Iraqis.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this movie - having seen a bunch of Clooney movies, describing this flick as somewhere in between \\"Three Kings\\" and \\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou?\\", with a touch of \\"Syriana\\" sprinkled on top, seems to say it all. The movie is satirical throughout, and at times just down right silly, but also sheds light on some real military programs and at times gives a rebuke of the U.S. military (but not so much the reasons given for the invasion, as one might think), both by portraying most of the military characters as mean-spirited or stupid, or the more stinging references to U.S.-led torture. Some could think the movie lacks direction or is a long way of not saying a whole lot - and there is some truth to that - but I found myself laughing at the gags and subtle twisted or incredibly ironic comments throughout the entire movie. I have to admit, I am no Star Wars fan at all, and though I have a general understanding of \\"The Force,\\" etc., I'm sure some of the Jedi talk went over my head. I never watched any of those recent Star Wars prequel movies, but know Ewan McGregor was the primary good guy in them, which makes his role as the newly-enlightened Jedi in this tale pretty funny in itself. The movie certainly does not lack in star power, and all of the big names give memorable performances. Clooney is zany, but with a real purpose, much like his character in the \\"Oh Brother\\" movie. Bridges' character seems to be a resurrection of the \\"Dude\\" in Big Lebowski. Spacey does an outstanding job of being a unlovable, uptight prick in his role.<br /><br />The last 20 minutes or so of the movie seem to be the darkest part of the film with the most real-life criticisms, but the twist on the ending is fantastic. One odd tidbit to come out was that apparently the only lasting legacy of this Jedi program was the development of new torture devices to break the will of captured enemies without using physical force. In one particularly dark sequence, the blasting of loud repetitive \\"Barney music\\" torture method on prisoners is shown and Bob laments that's the only part of his reporting on this fascinating tale to actually make news.<br /><br />What I most enjoy about this movie - in addition to the hilarity of Clooney's character - is the fact that it tackles controversial issues at times, but does so with a big dose of humor and often is presented in shades of gray that allow the viewer to think about things without necessarily being preached to. Issues aren't given to viewer in terms of right and wrong, but rather what may be right or wrong; what may be true versus what may not be true.oughout the entire movie.

B00003CXHJ|4.0|I am a sucker for submarine movies with interesting captain melodramas.  On that level, which is the stuff of hollywood's art, this film succeeds admirably:  it pulses with life, has very well drawn characters, spectacular special effects, and the pace of its adventure ticks along without a moment's lag.  The guys are on a deadly and vital mission, to steal the enigma machine from the inside of a Nazi submarine.  It is a clandestine operation that must be carried out with precision, some luck, and then there is a very hard fight to survive and accomplish the mission once unforeseen things happen.<br /><br />I particularly like the characters.  McConnaughey is an ambitious first officer who has been denied his first command, in large part because of his humanity and hence, purported lack of aptitude to make the difficult decisions (i.e. ordering a man to his death, even if he is unsure of the course that must be taken).  Around him are seasoned veterans, including the tough and smart enlisted chief, Keitel.  Once the captain (Paxton) is out of the picture, McConnaughey has to take over, facing down doubts about his ability and plotting a strategy in a near-impossible situation.  This is high drama and the actors pull it off with real style.<br /><br />What a lot of the critics have trouble with here is that it was the Brits, and not the Americans, who heisted the enigma from a Nazi sub.  I assume that that is the case.  Nonetheless, the film does not claim to be a historical drama or that the story is true.  Thus, it is just a movie and that is how it should be seen IMHO.  If you want to know the historical reality, there are plenty of books or other films for that.<br /><br />I would recommend this film as entertainment.  It is not objective history and does not pretend to be.

B001UV4XHY|4.0|As a die-hard fan of the Harry Potter books, I can honestly say that I enjoyed this movie very much, although a few things about the film could have been better.<br /><br />The best thing about \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\\" is that the producers were smart enough to split the final installment of J.K. Rowling's brilliant wizard saga into two films. As a result, not nearly as much content from the book was cut for Part I of \\"Deathly Hallows\\" as has been the case with the other HP movies. The book chronicles Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they decide to abandon their final year of education at Hogwarts and set off on a quest to take down the evil Lord Voldemort. What begins as a search for Voldemort's horcruxes also turns into a hunt for the three mysterious Deathly Hallows, along with a struggle for survival.<br /><br />This is a very dark and intense film, and rightfully so, as the seventh book in the HP series is the most grim of all. The filmmakers got a lot of things right, but there were a few disappointments. (Note: a few spoilers are ahead.) I understand the need to omit material from movies to meet time requirements, and I even understand the desire to make small alterations so certain things translate better from page to screen. However, changing things just for the sake of changing them really irritates me. One thing that really disappointed me was the sequence where Harry is taken away from the Dursley residence, and a bunch of Harry Potters undergo an airborne attack by Death Eaters. That scene was way too short in the film, and for some reason half of it took place in the middle of a busy London street, which made no sense at all. Hedwig's death was also rewritten a bit, and in my opinion it happened way too fast and didn't do the poor owl justice. (At least the Dobby death scene was much better.)<br /><br />I also wasn't happy that the film added some scenes that weren't in the book at all. This takes away from an opportunity to showcase more of the original plot from the novel. Why, for instance, include that stupid scene with Harry and Hermione dancing in the tent and cut the Harry/Lupin fight that occurs in Grimmauld Place? Most of the scenes that were new to the movie easily could have been omitted in favor of Rowling's original material.<br /><br />In spite of those shortcomings, however. this is truly an excellent film. It was made for fans of the books, so critics who blast the film for being too long and dragging in the beginning obviously have no idea what they're talking about. The cast is amazing, the effects are phenomenal, and you REALLY need to see this movie in the theatre. I cannot wait to see the final movie next spring.e novel.

B004B8RXQQ|1.0|We have long been fans of BBC mysteries and the new Sherlock Series proved quite disappointing and did not hold our interest.  We felt the series poorly done.  The last of the series seemed very disjointed.  Where are the great BBC series like Morse, Waking the Dead, (although we have ordered this continuing series from BBC UK)  Wallander is excellent and we love the light mysteries too, like Pie in the Sky.  I would rather the BBC (if they are trying to save money) produce fewer mysteries of better quality.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Those who liked the first movie will love this one.    The only thing I took a star away for was the digital copy required internet connection for authorisation and after an annoying length of time due to multiple popups I found the file was .wmv. The very poor compression rate this format provides means awful picture and sound quality when played on a big screen hd tv through a hardware media player. I deleted the file.
B000GSA59M|2.0|A very disappointing purchase.  Based on generally positive reviews of this model and Behringer boards in general, I may have just got a lemon.  It happens.  This unit produced very noticeable hiss - a level unacceptable for either home studio or live performance use.  Unusable. I sent it back.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|\\"Up ahead was Pandora,\\" remarks our central character Jake Sully, and James Cameron has finally unveiled a project to match his planet-size ego. Gazillions of stuff already posted regarding this movie, so chances are I'll only be regurgitating. But I side with all the gushy raves. AVATAR is phenomenal. The CG is bloody brilliant and breathes dimension and life into the twelve-foot-tall Na'Vi. There are significant plot points in the story which echo DANCES WITH WOLVES. In essence, AVATAR is a western masquerading as a sci-fi flick. As far as the premise with the human cripple who casts his awareness into an alien body, off the top of my head, author Lin Carter's Green Star series, written in the 1970s, featured this same basic hook. But AVATAR takes this premise and injects it with solid storytelling, enlivens it with an appealing cast. We sometimes forget that James Cameron, beneath his jonesing for razzle-dazzle, knows how to tell a grand story. Again, the man demonstrates remarkable execution. Man alive, things have come a ways since WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT?, hasn't it?<br /><br />The plotty plot: Jake Sully, a paraplegic ex-Marine, journeys from a dying Earth to the mysterious distant planet, Pandora, and signs up to fill his murdered twin brother's slot in the Avatar project. The inhabitants indigenous to Pandora are called the Na'Vi, and they are humanoid and blue-skinned and twelve-foot-tall. On Pandora, Jake becomes an Avatar driver, able to transfer his consciousness into a clone made up of combined human and Na'Vi DNA. The story's central conflict is that, while the Avatar program is dedicated to peacefully learning about the Na'Vi, there is also a corporate entity backed by a strong military presence intent on harvesting unobtanium, a rare super-conducting mineral, a rich deposit of which lies underneath the local Na'Vi village.<br /><br />Whether it was a sign from Pandora's goddess or that this dumb grunt exhibits absolutely no fear, Jake's Avatar shockingly gets an in with the hostile Omaticaya clan. And so the corporation also thinks it now has an in. But Jake finds himself wrestling with conflicting allegiances, even as the beautiful Neytiri tutors him in the ways of the Na'Vi. Jake must decide; the Time of Great Sorrow fast approaches. Will it be the blue girl and the exhilarating communion with nature? Or will it be Semper Fi and the Jarhead Clan and a chance to remedy his withered legs? Will it be the carrot or the stick imposed on the Na'Vi?<br /><br />There really are very few unmissable cinematic events; AVATAR is one of them. The core narrative is not original, but James Cameron embellishes it with such monumental bells and whistles. The CG technology is truly groundbreaking, with eye-popping imagery surfacing every damn minute. I'm not really down with heavy-handed message movies, but I was drawn into the Na'Vi's struggles against the encroaching human predators. You have to credit the cast for making it into a hell of a compelling drama, and Sam Worthington and Zoe Saldana generate massive sparks together. Sigourney Weaver plays the tough scientist, and it's probably a wise move to change her character's surname from Shipley to Augustine (\\"Shipley\\" sounds too close to \\"Ripley\\"). Giovanni Ribisi gets the slimy Paul Reiser part from ALIENS. Stephen Lang gets one of the juiciest roles he will ever get as the scary Colonel Miles Quaritch. He's amazing. Anyway, I can't rave enough. Like most of you, I've seen AVATAR a bunch of times now, because this is a picture that rewards you with repeated viewings. It works as a sci-fi adventure film, as an environmental call to arms, as an emotional human drama, as a love story. And, Ooo-rah!, there is even some classic deadpan Marine humor. As mentioned, it's a great western cloaked as a sci-fi flick.<br /><br />This is the 3-disc DVD Set featuring three different versions of the movie, with the movie broken down into two parts and on two discs.

B00428ZRFE|4.0|My track by track review:    S&M - A very strong dance-ready club song, with a dirty message on the side. What's not to love? This is the planned third single following \\"What's my Name\\" I'm a little excited to see how this song ends up on radio since it (somewhat) talks about some adult fetish-y subject matter.... ready or not FCC, here come Rihanna! (4.5/5)    What's My Name (feat. Drake) - Slightly repetitive & Drake's introductive rap leaves something to be desired as it is somewhat short and un-fufilling. However, the light-hearted feel and danceability of this track is what saves it. Also, Rihanna proves that she doesn't need a featured artist to support her track and that she can carry a tune without someone else. The 2nd single (4.5/5)    Cheers (Drink To That) - Not a song that's meant to be taken seriously. A song for the weekend to hear at the bar and get drunk and happy to. Easily single & radio material and I'm sure it will be at some point in 2011. It runs a LITTLE too long though, and I'm not quite sure how I feel about the Avril Lavigne sampling....sometimes it seems to fit, others it doesn't. Overall, it works though. (4/5)    Fading - I'm not sure why, but whoever was arranging the order of the tracks on this cd, stupidly put this song between all of the faster and happier songs. It isn't that this is a bad song....it isn't...in fact, it's a cute song. But it's out of place on this album, it sounds like an outtake from \\"A Girl Like Me\\". The Right Song in the Wrong Place. (3/5)    Only Girl (In the World) - The 1st single released....and boy is it a strong one. This one doesn't play around. It's hard and when you are in the club, it means some serious business. Had LOUD been a techno album, this would have been a better representation of the album, but since most of the album is medium pace as opposed to fast-paced, I think it tricked some of her buyers into thinking this would be a rave album.  That aside this is one of the better she's ever made. (5/5)    California King Bed - This song blew me away...most people reviewing this song have said one of two things about it; it is either their favorite or they believe it is a \\"mediocre ballad\\". This is one of the first tracks where I can tell that Rihanna has some serious vocals. It was hard to tell before because she was either too young (first 2 albums) and sounded nasally or it was there, but the background and supportive music played her out (GGGB & RR). Here it is quite apparent, and made even better by the fact that there's no auto-tune (*coughs* Ke$ha). If this isn't released as a single, I will be both surprised and disappointed. (5/5)    Man Down - You know, the first few times I heard this song, I hated it and thought it was rather tacky.  However, this song really grew on me the more I heard it, especially the \\"rum pum pa pum\\". Whether it's about Chris Brown or not (which I don't think it is, I think it's just coincidental), it's one you'll either learn to like, or never like at all....again though, it sounds like it should be on one of her earlier albums. (3.5/5)    Raining Men (feat. Nicki Minaj) - This song was the biggest sore on the album. I was really disappointed as I was expecting much better than this. That blaring alarm sound get's very annoying and... \\"eenie meenie miny no?\\" C'mon REALLY?  You can't do better than that?  Nicki's verses are way too short and unsatisfying . Poorly executed all around....but it'll probably be released anyway because Nicki is on it. (1.5/5)    Complicated - Mixed bag here. The lyrics are great and perfect for those who feel similar to this in their own relationships & Rihanna's vocals once again, shine bright in this song. But MAN, the production in this song (the background music) is a huge mess. It's as if it can't decide if it wants to be a dancer or a slow jam or right in the middle. Whoever produced this track needs to be fired. Middle of the road (3/5)    Skin - This song is highly sensual...basically everything you have been thinking when you wanted to have sex, but never got around to saying, she basically spills all in this track. Dirty without being grossly raunchy. Perfect! Rihanna makes up for several preceding duds with this track. Just don't let your younger kids here this track or they'll be asking you all kinds of questions you may not want to answer. (5/5)    Love The Way You Lie (Part II) - This version of the song far exceeds the original. Being that this song is about a violent relationship that nether like but neither quite want to leave, this was a better way to approach it; stripped and simple, raw and emotional and who better than Rihanna to do this song. However, Eminem suddenly appears and just ruins it with this exceedingly angry over-the- top nonsense. Maybe it worked for the original, but definitely not here. If you bought this album online, it probably came with a \\"Piano Version\\", This is the best version of all. No annoying drums, no Eminem. It's just Rihanna and a piano. That's it. Perfection.      LTWYL Part 2 w/ Eminem (3.5/5) ][ LTWYL Part 2 Piano Version (5/5)    All in all, this album is quite solid. It is not her best, but it definitely is not her worst. What she needs to do though is examine who her best songwriters, producers and musicians . Keep them, and fire the rest. I say this, because there are clear winners and losers on this album. A duet does not always mean gold, and upbeat does not always mean awesome.     LOUD (overall) (3.5/5)
0780628551|5.0|Johnny Depp (SLEEPY HOLLOW, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, THE NINTH GATE, SECRET WINDOW, SWEENEY TODD) plays an astronaut who returns from a mission as a \\"changed\\" man. Charlize Theron (MONSTER, THE ROAD) plays the title wife, slowly realizing that the man she married just might not be the one who returned from space. If you are a fan of paranoia thrillers like THE STEPFORD WIVES, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, etc., then THE ASTRONAUT'S WIFE fits right in. Is it \\"slow-moving\\"? Yes, but this actually builds suspense and thickens the mystery. Is there a lack of explosions and / or sci-fi conventions? Yes, no ray-guns or space battles here. It's not a true horror film either. TAW is more of a flesh-crawler than a jumpy, fright-fest. I loved every minute of it...
B004BC7MRM|5.0|If you are a Kid Rock fan, and didn't know this was where he was headed, you have had your head firmly planted in your own nether regions.  I've always been a casual fan of KR's music, but he has finally put out an entire album of songs I can get behind. Those of you who are disappointed that he's stopped writing juvenile, profanity laced, self aggrandizing music and decided to grow up, may want to take a look in the mirror and wonder if maybe you should do the same.  I don't expect everyone to like it, but people should respect a man who has decided to mature.  What some of you mistake for boring \\"old man\\" music, I would classify as life affirming and introspective.  He seems to be comfortable with himself and who he's growing into.  While I've always been mildly amused with the hell raising party boy and I've definitely been impressed with his gravitas,  his new music speaks to me in a way \\"American Badass\\" never did nor ever will.  Not everyone wants their rock star to stay a child forever.  Bravo Kid Rock.
B000G73U5Y|5.0|HUGE fan.  Great crossover sounds and own many.  Lot of repeats but thats OK, still love this band over the years.
B000002IR7|5.0|This by far is one of the most underrated Booker T albums of all time, sure it only contains two of Booker Ts top hits which are Green Onions and Mo' Onions, but it also contains a lot of bluesy, pre-funk jams that inspired Booker T and the MGs to continue recording. Before Green Onions Booker T and the MGs were a blues band that would play blues riffs like Behave Yourself and a lot of the riffs were slow and churchy sounding. I think this album shows the MGs for the truly diverse music geniuses they were. They could play slow, soulful blues that fit the nightclub scenes in the 60s, as well as play up-beat, funky grooves like the fast paced Green Onions. I have both this and the very best of Booker T and the MGs on my itunes and feel like having both these CDs gives me the best variety of their songs from their older blues riffs, to their more modern funk. Only two of the songs on this CD are on the very best of Booker T, so you aren't losing much by getting both. Sure it isn't the greatest Booker T album, or it doesn't quite rock as hard as their later albums like Hip Hug Her, but it still is filled with just as much soul and has the distinguishable Booker T organ sound. In my opinion it is a must own for any soul/Booker T fan just for the early hard to find recordings.

B003X2O6KW|4.0|Kanye is a brilliant producer. His arrangements are quite complex and this latest is no exception. what is interesting is that he basically featured as many people as possible on this album. On the song \\"All of the Lights\\" he featured The Dream, Alicia Keys, Rihanna, Ryan Leslie, Tony Williams, Charlie WIlson, Fergie, Kid Cudi, John Legend, and Elton John. Honestly, you can only make out a few of those artists throughout the track and some of them seem out of place. Sonically though, the track is amazing. This is true with most of the songs on the album. He really step his game up (again) and put together an amazing album. BUT... lyrically, I think Kanye thinks he can say anything on a track even if it doesn't really pertain to the rest of the song. I mean, honestly, why talk about Michael Jackson being dead and then choking your girlfriend (Amber Rose) in the same verse???<br /><br />That aside, this will be an amazing instrumental. Lyrically it leaves something to be desired though.<br /><br />side bar..... Nicki Minaj does an amazing job on Monster! Love her verse as well as Jay-Z's!
B0043URV8M|2.0|There were days when one could hardly wait for the release of the soundtrack to a film, and in the meantime we did our best to remember themes, motifs, all the memorable moments of the music for a new movie.  Sadly, those days seem to be more and more rare.  I left \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part I\\" with that latter thought in mind.  To be blunt I was underwhelmed and could not remember much about Alexander Desplait's music which contributed to my overall felling that this was one of the least satisfying entries in the Harry Potter series.  Briefly, the film was true to the first half of the book, and certainly had some great moments, but it also had too many pregnant pauses and literally dead moments (actual black screen at times)...did we really need two parts?  Ah, but money speaks and granted there was much to cover.  Throughout the film I listened closely to a score that seemed atmospheric enough but really failed to catch the full magic (dark or light) of the subject.  True, the story is dark and needed a score to match it, but that was not the real issue; I kept thinking where, oh where is John Williams or the other composers that chimed in later.  I read one review that suggested that this score earned Desplait the right to do the grand finale; I am sorry but I must disagree.  Desplait is a fine composer, and he did a serviceable job here, but Harry Potter deserves something more inspired.  The score was simply adequate on the screen and really does not stand well alone as a soundtrack recording.
B000002LEM|5.0|Bought this when it came out in '88. Still listen to it till this day. Mine all Mine, AFU, Cabo, Infection, Black and Blue etc... are all great tunes with great playing. Never cared for Finish What Ya Started, myself. Hope to hear a new one soon!
B000069KJ0|5.0|I have played the Third Ann&egrave;e for years, and it's one of my \\"bread and butter\\" pieces.  I know this music inside and out, yet I have never heard a recording of this Third Ann&egrave;e that I really cared for.<br /><br />In Liszt's later works, every note counts for something:  there is neither one note too many or one note too few.  Berman captures this perfectly.  As such, pieces which are interpretively *very* difficult to play, such as the first of the Ville d'Este threnody and the Funeral March are incisive, and at the same time they \\"soar.\\"  Berman  at once makes you aware of the structure of the piece, how all the elements of the piece fit together -- and yet propels the music forward.<br /><br />Berman's performance of \\"Angelus!\\" is the ONLY performance I've heard of this piece which *exactly* captured the mood suggested by the Scriptural reference (the Angel announcing to the Virgin Mary that she is carrying the Savior of the world). He exactly captures the reverence of the piece, so as that every single note counts for something.  All the other versions I've heard of Angelus! were superficial and much, MUCH too fast.<br /><br />The \\"Sursum corda\\" with its five-page, continuous crescendo actually has a continuous crescendo which lasts five pages, yet does not suffocate itself in a massive tsunami of sound and you can still hear the recurring eight measure theme which forms the structural framework of the piece all throughout the performance.<br /><br />Berman's \\"Third Ann&egrave;e\\" hit me with the force of a revelation. After hearing Berman's recording of the piece, I stopped and rethought *everything* about these pieces, conceptually, interpretively, structurally - so when I perform these again it will be a completely different -- and hopefully more mature performance.  Simply put:  Berman's is the gold standard by which all other performances of the Third Ann&egrave;e must be measured.  This performance is just about as good as it gets!
B001AQO3XS|2.0|I love Highlander. This is the first time I've seen the \\"Director's Cut\\" and I like it even more than the original theatrical release.     The major annoyance with the Blu-Ray version is the obvious change in picture quality between scenes. I'm sure this is due in part to the newly added \\"Director's Cut\\" scenes which have never been \\"cleaned up\\" in post-production for theatrical release. However, there are many scenes that are part of the original theatrical release that look horrible, worse than the VHS and DVD versions of the original Highlander that I have seen. Some of these scenes have horrible grain, are fuzzy, bad contrast, and bad color. Then other scenes look amazingly great, what you expect a Blu-Ray to look like. The picture quality seems to degrade with the darker scenes, which would be expected with the film stocks in use when Highlander was originally filmed. But this would not explain picture quality so bad that it is worse than the VHS version of the movie.    More should have been done to clean up the film in the transfer to Blu-Ray. While watching the movie I was constantly distracted by the changes in picture quality. It was like watching a 1080p high definition Blu-Ray one second and watching my first TV set (with rabbit ears) the next. This should have been a 5 star review but someone decided to get cheap in mastering this version of the film to Blu-Ray.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|Fringe has amazing potential.  More people need to watch it!  This show starts out very very slowly but after about episode 5 the series really begins to pick up momentum.  There are twists and turns after most episodes that leave you dying for more!  I simply love this show!!
B002VKE0XA|3.0|Better than the first Paranormal Activity but only by a bit.  It has a baby and a dog which ups the creep factor.    Some amazing cheap scares.      Little more mature in terms of content and language (which helps its cause).    Amazing sound for those of you who can watch this in Dolby 5.1.    You want a good haunted house story that doesnt make you think.  This is a good bet.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This is a BIG cooler. Make sure you have the room for it, but be prepared to enjoy a great CPU cooler. Fairly quite, I'm only using one fan and my AMD 1090T stays very cool (35c or so).     For the price you can't go wrong. And because of its size it looks great!
B003EYVXT6|3.0|This is a quick review on the Blu-Ray version of Splice (rented at Queen Video in Toronto)    Passable creature flick with a good script and decent cast.  Blu-Ray version didnt have anything outstanding in picture quality that a regular DVD would capture.  No stunning scene scapes, creature effects were almost human so you would do fine withe either version.    This would appeal to fans for the Cronenburg version of the fly, albeit without the gore factor.  Although there is one moment in the film with Adrian Brodie that is just crazy.    Its a fun film overall.  Don't have high expectations and its worth your time but probably not a buyer unless you are right into the genre.
B000BSLU2S|5.0|Arctic Silver 5, the only way to go. Doing an awesome job of keeping my AMD 1090T running cold (35c or less) mated to a Hyper Cooler 212plus.<br /><br />If you need to keep your cool, look no farther.
0312600844|1.0|So I'm half way through \\"Freedom\\" and figured I'd better check out the reviews to find out if maybe I'm reading the wrong book, not that one that Oprah blessed and even The Economist likes, because the book I'm reading stinks.     A plot as strained as just-cooked spaghetti. An unending \\"autobiography\\" insert that reads like a Creative Writing 101 character sketch. The now-mandatory musing about 9/11 without it having the slightest relevance to the story at hand. Rants about sex and pop music and population growth and liberals and businessmen and politicians and parenting and giving a damn about anything -- every whine you can conjure up about post-reality America is in this thing, looping ad nauseum, never getting anywhere near a point.    The one unforgivable flaw in a novel is boring, unbelievable characters, and wow, are these folks a set. There's not one person in \\"Freedom\\" you wouldn't sprint from if they sat down next to you and started a conversation. Who are these people modeled after, Franzen? How can I be sure to avoid them?     I'm doing something I rarely do: freeing myself from the last 200 pages of \\"Freedom\\".
0345505387|5.0|I adore the entire book series and am known in my home for my obsessive rereading of Outlander. So when I saw this on the bookshelf I picked it up, expecting to be disappointed because of the reviews on Amazon. I was not and would recommend anyone who loves the adventure and romanticism of the first book to go pick this up. Definitely not a format I generally am attracted but I do love the summarization of the story purely for instant gratification reasons. I also love seeing drawings of Jamie naked. Yes, yes I do.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Many people disliked this movie before it even came out, and that is because they had already decided the KOTCS could not be as good as the originals. If this was some movie not affiliated with the Indy Franchise, many of the \\"haters\\" would've loved this movie. People reacted the same way with the prequel Star Wars movies...
B003VS0CX8|5.0|If you like to be entertained by the films you watch, buy this one.  What?  I told you this was a simple review.
B004BC7MRM|1.0|Well I just listened to the new Kid Rock CD, What A Turd, I've been a long time Kid Rock fan, and been supportive through all the albums, This one however has not a single redeeming quality. If it would fit I would flush it down the toilet so it could be at home with other turds of it's kind. Don't be fooled by the $3.99 price tag, even at that low it will still be very disappointing. After this Kid rock should take the ROCK out of his name, this is G@y Urban Cowboy music...... A SAD DAY FOR A TRUE KID ROCK FAN...
157421327X|1.0|These books are the biggest waste of time and money! I bought two of them and returned them both. Really? Copyrighting doodle patterns? Are we serious? None of these \\"doodles\\", \\"scribbles\\" whatever you want to call them was particularly unique. I wished they had explored more about the meditative potential of doing this kind of work. THEN, it may have been worthwhile. Don't waste your time!  Joyce
0060254920|5.0|I remember having my parents read this book to me over and over. Now I've got a 6 and 4 year old that ask me to do the same. Forget the movie. The book is a classic.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|Every episode of the series ROME is like a Hollywood movie itself! The characters, costumes, acting, drama, and especially the lighting and visuals is top notch - it will leave you in awe! As a photographer I found myself constantly captivated by the amazing environmental lighting. That you're also getting a history lesson while watching is edutainment at it's finest -- a Hollywood education that is. Surely the series is not completely historically accurate, and there is the HBO factor added (certainly not appropriate for young views in the home), but taking that into account the series makes for a spectacular viewing experience and give you an idea of who Pompey Magnus, Julius Caesar, Octavian/Augustus, Mark Antony, Cleopatra, Cato, Cicero, and Brutus are and how they interact, as well as an appreciation of the social classes, politics and life of Ancient Rome and the beginning of the Roman Empire.
B000063DI8|5.0|I have collected all Iron Maiden studio albums and this one is the best. Follows are Iron Maiden, Number of the Beast. Every sone is catchy and there is no filler here. It's interesting that this one is underated whereas some (Seventh son, Powerslave) are overrated by Maiden fans. Janick Gers is a great guitarist and his colleration with Dave is more effective than Dave & Andraw.
B0043URV8M|1.0|This soundtrack could be dubbed over any of a dozen films - there is absolutely nothing that says \\"Harry Potter\\". At. All. I own the soundtracks to all of the HP movies, and all of the others describe people or \\"moments\\" in the films. You hear the music and feel the moment. This one....nothing. Most of it could be dinner music at the local restaurant. I saw the movie over the weekend, and because the music is so non-descript the movie was less intense than it could have been.     I was expecting the emotional impact of the scene when Dobby dies to be quite intense - he's been a favorite throughout the series. It should have been poignant and heartfelt, just as the music created was when Dumbledore died. Not here. No emotion in the music whatsoever.     I'm so disappointed - I listen to the HP soundtracks often, and I've already taken this one off my iPod, it's so non-descript. And yes, I've listened to it at least 6 times to see if it would \\"grow\\" on me. I was really hoping John Williams would come back for the next one - I'd like to hear Hedwig's Theme in the musical score again!
031603438X|5.0|I really enjoyed his stories of his childhood and early formative years as a teenager, his family and relatives before he started playing music. And his descriptions of the villages and his schooling after WWII, etc. But the point in the book where his future experiences all made sense to me, was where he was 'at the crossroads'. He describes, in profound terms, the leap he made into the storm of musical history that was being made at that very moment in time.(In context, I first heard the Rolling Stones first album at a friends house as a 14 year old. The garage band I was in covered every song on the 12x5, Rolling Stones Now and Out of Our Heads. I literally mean we learned every song) And to read about all the albums I had of theirs and how they were created is truly awesome. Finally the most touching part that I could identify with was the very end, playing for his Mom. I did the same for mine and that really touched my heart.     If you ever wanted to read the first hand account of the life and times of this Living Legend, buy this book.    Highly Recommended.
B000FC1LOC|3.0|I really enjoyed the book, but it was too sad to finish. I tried 3 times but couldn't.  I do enjoy how the books switches each chapter to a different perspective of each character. I may try one more time to finish it, but the last chapter i read had me crying my eyes out.
031603438X|4.0|I really enjoyed the parts about his life and the Stones etc. It can get a little tedious when he goes on about guitar chords and his favorite bass players he has played with throughout the years, etc. But if you plod on, you will get to more juicy bits! I like the fact that it is more or less chronological, as I have read too many autobiographies lately that skip around.
B00000IBVC|5.0|This will be the second copy of the Turandot - Live at Peking Forbidden City that I have, the previous copy is in VHS format where in those days where DVD is yet to innovate yet, since there is no subtitle therefore I have absolutely no idea what they are singing about, but overall even though I know what the story is about but without the subtitle it is hard to understand what is going on. The DVD version of the opera comes with Subtitle in English & Chinese. Even though the Chinese subtitle does not appear in every conversation (the Japanese subtitle almost translate all the conversation during the entire show), but it gives me a better understanding on the entire story.<br /><br />However, I always wish that Barbara Frittoli can play the main character \\"Turandot\\" while Casolla played the character \\"Liu\\". Barbara Frittoli have the sweetest tune compare with Casolla, in fact in some Classical music review, \\"Liu\\"'s part in the opera is the most difficult and technical in the story.<br /><br />Love the setting of the stage and of course the culture dance, love the angel of death (in Act I, when the prince is about to be axe, a group of woman dancer dress in white, dancing under the moonlight), director Zhang Yi-Mou portrait the traditional Chinese version of Angel of Death well, and the little monk holding lotus lamp at the end make the show more interesting.<br /><br />Hesitated on buying the DVD? Just go for it! I will give this DVD 5 out of 5 stars.
1441965904|5.0|I have a PhD in Linguistics and a Masters in Translation of Post-colonial Literature. Although I believe my level of English is already high, I found this book incredibly useful for giving oral presentations of my work. What it proved to me is that in reality my main problem, and presumably that of many non-native presenters, is not really due to problems in English but much more due to the structure, slides full of redundant text, and to a general lack of thought for the audience. This book has suggestions for researchers who have already presented on many occasions, to those who have never done a presentation before. What helped me in particular was useful advice on how to differentiate my presentation  from those of other presenters at the conference. I managed to do this by adopting a more relaxed and informal tone, by considerably reducing the amount of information to give the audience, and by learning to be a little more entertaining - not easy things to do, but this book told me how.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|This album showcases Josh Groban's voice which I am so glad it does. His other albums were great but I love to just hear his voice, which, by the way has gotten better  if that's possible. Rick Rubin did a great job which I believe was his intention. Josh's song writing ability just blew me away as I didn't realize how good he really is at it. Some people don't realize he writes most of the music and collaborates on the lyrics. What a talent!!!!
B0046IGOIO|2.0|Caveat emptor!  I love what the Doors have done with their many Bright Midnight titles, especially the truly epic shows like Detroit, Boston and New York City.  But this one is far from the best, and might actually be the worst so far.<br /><br />First off, the audio quality is flat-out terrible.  The tape is awash in hiss, with low volume levels and almost zero stereo separation; in fact it sounds like mono.  Bootleg quality at best.  The show opens with 5 minutes of aimless tuning -- I understand the fanatical complete-show concept, but at least editing down this intro, not to mention tightening the lengthy dead spots in between songs, would have been preferable.  Jim's banter with the audience here is amusing and sometimes illuminating, but minutes on end of instrument tuning and hissy silence can get a bit tedious, no?<br /><br />Performance-wise, the band sounds fine (especially Robby, who plays fantastically well), but Jim sounds generally distracted, undersinging all the way except for an incendiary \\"When the Music's Over\\" and the four blues numbers. While it's cool to hear the band sharing the stage with monster bluesman Albert King -- this will be worth the price of admission for some -- it only makes one wish this rare summit meeting were captured in half-decent sound quality.<br /><br />The fact that Rhino's always attractive, and often lavish, packaging of past releases has been jettisoned in favor of a cheap paper gatefold with no booklet says it all.<br /><br />Meanwhile, we sit and wait for an official release of the complete Isle of Wight Festival performance from August 1970.  One of the Doors' last-ever shows, and probably their last great one, it has a complete film and soundboard audio recording thanks to \\"Message to Love\\" director Murray Lerner, who has publicly and repeatedly stated that he'd love to finish the material for release.<br /><br />Ray, Robby, John?  Over to you...
B00005JKMQ|5.0|This is one great movie! I love the boxing sport... This movie was just awesome. But isn't that almost always the case with films that are based on true stories?! Will Smith is the character \\"Ali\\" and he is fantastic, not to mention very believable in this film. I recommend to everyone! I have to watch it on a regular schedule... Yes, it's that good!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I absolutely love this CD.  I think Illuminations really expresses the growth in Josh, the artist.  I must admit, it took a few listens before I got several of the songs, but now, I can't get this music out of my head.  It's simple, yet hauntingly beautiful.  Josh's voice has never sounded better.  Highly recommend this new CD to all music lovers.
1439177783|4.0|first off, i am a strong christian gal and i still purposely sought out this book.  i got a lot of flack about reading this book from my 'sisters'  so if you're a christian and don't want to read about a homosexual woman, you're stupid  and need to get over yourself.    this book was very well written, have FABULOUS insight to the mind of a tween-grown woman's   brokenness over her body and desperate need to be accepted and feel worthy.    i have a 10yr old son and a 8yr old daughter. i am obsessed right now with learning more on  on growing girls who believe their worth is related to their physical appearance and the   approval of their peers/mothers.    so i liked this book a lot because of it's insight and her journey towards healing, BUT having said that  i'm not a fan how have she is now cured and 'all better now'.    maybe she was delivered of her 30 year addiction/self loathing and (self)mental abuse. but i would've liked  to hear about (if she has any) ongoing healing and maybe even struggle with her old self.  but maybe that's just me.
B0044KU7KU|4.0|The first time I heard My Chemical Romance, it was on the radio. It was their breakthrough single, \\"I'm Not Okay(I Promise)\\", and I took the title quite seriously. They were not okay. They were actually quite not good at all.  However, when they released their 2006 album, \\"The Black Parade\\", a friend played it for me and I was instantly interested. It was a wonderful connection between classic rock allusions and influences mixed with the Misfits. It even had a storyline, though it was nearly impossible to follow passingly (like most concept albums). I was eager to ehar what they did next, and over the course of the next four years \\"The Black Parade\\" was constantly in my CD player and on my iPod.  Needless to say, when I heard lead off single \\"Na Na Na\\", I was pretty floored. It was a pretty righteous song, all quick guitars and nonsense, but fun, lyrics and possibly the best solo of the last few years. It was, and is, a terrific rock song. I was now eagerly excited to hear what came next.  \\"Danger Days\\" does not disappoint any of my expectations, which were already pretty lofty. It is a fun, tight record with a pretty nifty comic book concept and more than a fair share of killer tunes. Like \\"The Black Parade\\" this is a big, shiny rock record with bigger hooks, with some of the songs, specifically \\"Sing\\", \\"Summertime\\" and \\"The Kids from Yesterday\\", begging to be played live in large arenas. \\"Planetary (Go!)\\" is downright funky, a truly danceable track with some pretty funny and clever lyrics to boot. \\"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\\" features the records most mega chorus, and the garage punk tunes \\"Party Poison\\" and \\"Vampire Money\\" succesfully call out garage bands of the past while still putting a special My Chem spin on the genre. Occasionally the group falter, most notably on the boring \\"Save Yourself\\" and \\"DESTROYA\\", two tracks that failed to leave any discernable impression on me after repeated listens.  Musically the record is more melodic and keyboard driven than any of thebands previous records, but this style fits the band perfectly. Where their earlier records (which I went back and have a passing interest in as time has gone by) were more aggressive, and \\"The Black Parade\\" was pretty melodic and epic, \\"Danger Days\\" mixes the two while adding tighter songcraft. Lyrically the record is strong, and features some of lead singer Gerad Way's best lyrics to date.  I enjoyed \\"Danger Days\\" fully. It's a tight, well constructed rock record that's as much fun to listen to as I assume it was to make. If you like MCR, you will almost certainly enjoy this record, and even if you haven't in the past, you might still find yourself nodding your head to quite a few of the songs.
0689865384|5.0|loved this book from the first page.  i wasn't thrilled about the teen romace in the later stages of the book, but  other then that it has a great message about how things are not always what they seem  and how to think for yourself.  i LOVED THE ENDING!
B0042RUMEQ|2.0|Well, in the pantheon of hip-hop culture there was a group called Public Enemy. If you don't know them, you should. They were excellent. But anyways, they had a song, \\"Don't Believe The Hype\\". And that pretty much describes the debut record of Nicki Minaj as best as I think anyone could.  Though she has been featured on what seems like every third or forth song over the last six months or so, \\"Pink Friday\\" is Minaj's debut solo full length, and she fails to rise to the occasions. Throughout the entire record, cardboard, dull 808 beats play under trite plucking keyboards. There is not a lot of imagination here.   Lyrically, Minaj has some skills, but she seems to be better in small dosages than on a full length. She lacks the charisma to carry the entire record, and doesn't offer a lot of interesting to say. Even her guests, Rihanna, Drake, Kanye West, seem bored and unsure of what to do. Eminem, who has been killing it over the past year or so, sounds bored on \\"Roman's Revenge\\".  A few decent tracks do come out. \\"Your Love\\" borrows a hook from Annie Lennox to excellent effect, and Minaj's verses and vocal hook are both excellent. \\"Dear Old Nicki\\" is an interesting listen, though I'm not sure if it will hold up on repeated listens.  That pretty much describes this record. It might sound alright while you're playing it, but I doubt that you will listen to it more than a few times. Minaj might posses the talent to release a good album, but this simply is not it.
0439023521|5.0|this book is outstanding.  got it for my 10yr old and it turns out he had just checked it out himself from the school library. so we read it together.  brutal, grim and again and well developed.  but what's with the 'sexy' outfits during the opening ceremonies and all the kissing in the caves.  i am not a fan of teen romance (as you can see from all my other reviews) but it made for great book review topics w/my boy.  this book is one of my favorites.
6304806434|5.0|This movie is great, even if people say nicolas cage is on the juice in this movie   he still is jacked! Plus itS fast enough paste to keep you interested.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|Let's get it out of the way up front: If you even tangentially follow the hip hop blogosphere or Twitterverse, you've heard almost all of the substantive tracks on this album (two of the 13 tracks are an interlude and outro). Fully five of the 11 songs were part of Kanye's G.O.O.D. Fridays scheme, another three leaked months ahead of the album's release, and \\"Dark Fantasy\\" was included in Kanye's recent short film. But does it matter? Maybe Kanye's done the impossible and crafted an album so good that we'll pay for it even when he gives it away for free.     After listening to the record you'll appreciate how succinctly the album's title summarizes its themes. The record is framed as a fairy tale and the first few lines (\\"The watered down one, the one you know/ Was made up centuries ago...Twisted fiction, sick addiction/ Gather around children, zip it, listen) almost allude to the gradual censorship of the Brothers Grimm's dark fairytales over the centuries. On My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Kanye seeks to dismantle the facade of fame and fortune to reveal the twisted debauchery underneath.    Kanye's trademark arrogance is in full force on this album. But this time it's an unapologetic arrogance that's a product of being treated like a god on earth. On \\"Devil in a New Dress\\" he rhymes \\"It's hard to be humble when you're stuntin' on a jumbotron\\" and on \\"POWER\\" \\"I embody every characteristic of the egotisic, he knows he's so gifted.\\" The occult is another central theme, not only in track titles like \\"Devil in a New Dress,\\" \\"Monster\\" and \\"Hell of a Life\\" but in the bars on each record. Kanye offers \\"We headed to hell, for heaven's sake huh?/ Well I'mma levitate and make the devil wait, yeah.\\"     Perhaps the most personal theme on the album is a feeling of dissatisfaction in the face of so much commercial and critical success. We hear it on  \\"Runaway\\" (\\"I always find something wrong/ You've been putting up with me just way too long/I'm so gifted at finding what Idon't like the most\\"). And while Kanye keeps up the pretense of ego (see above) it's clear that the endless criticism has forced chinks in his armor. There are unveiled jabs at both Saturday Night Live and South Park, and bars including \\"It's not funny anymore, try different jokes,\\" and \\"I was lookin' at my resume, feelin' real fresh today/ But they rewrite history, I don't believe in yesterday.\\"       In short, the album is brilliant. The rhymes are clever, the music is rich, the emotions are raw and the themes are dark. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy will be an interesting experiment in an age of dwindling album sales ostensibly due to piracy. If Kanye can move 800,000 units in his first week despite having given the album away, the power of good music will be proven and artists will have no one to blame but themselves.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Even though Kanye gave away most of the Album free it feels great to support a great artist. I bought real CD Itunes and Amazon Digital. Great Album keep putting out G.O.O.D music Kanye
B003Z9Q4WG|5.0|At long, long last, SONY-CBS  has released its LEONARD BERNSTEIN SYMPHONY EDITION, following at least a good month and a half postponement from its originally scheduled date!<br /><br />The release of this CBS-Sony box set to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the maestro's passing in 1990 promises to be a generous feast of sixty compact discs.  What immediately comes to my mind here as a haunting reminder is the thirty eight DG Herbert von Karajan SYMPHONIES EDITION, released to commemorate the centennial anniversary of that conductor's birth year 2008, in 2009.  That set included complete symphony cycles of Beethoven, Bruckner, Brahms, Schumann, Mendelssohn, and Tchaikovsky, together with Haydn's six \\"Paris\\" and twelve \\"London\\" Symphonies, together with Mozart's 32, \\"Haffner,\\" \\"Linz,\\" \\"Prague,\\" the great Nos. 39, 40, and \\"Jupiter.\\"  All of these DG recordings do not quite approach the width and depth of Bernstein in their box.  DG released a complete HvK Edition of some 200 discs in Japan, of all places.  I cannot imagine why they did not make a wider, more global circulation.  Also, to mark that event, there were two EMI mega boxes released to commemorate HvK on 160 discs: an orchestral box and an operas box.<br /><br />Many of the recordings included in this comprehensive Lenny box are recordings upon which I can be said to have \\"cut my classical music teeth\\" back in the late 60s-early 1970s with their original LP record incarnations.  Back then,  I devoured the Mahler, Franck, Nielsen, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and the Schumann.  Particularly memorable were the Haydn \\"Paris\\" Symphonies, which even until and through this day, despite all manner of digital sound reproduction technique, I would stand Lenny's renditions of them, all of them, up against anyone else`s here.  I look forward to reacquainting myself with the re mastered Shostakovich SEVENTH.<br /><br />In this box set, among the more than one hundred symphonies offered and packaged here are complete cycles of Beethoven, Brahms, Tchaikovsky, Sibelius, Schumann, Haydn's \\"Paris\\" and Londons,\\" as well as the very beloved cutting edge Mahler.<br /><br />Unlike previously earlier abortive Sony-CBS attempts to capitalize on the Leonard Bernstein stamp with the \\"Prince of Wales\\" sponsorship and \\"Bernstein Century\\" recordings, recordings which were served up in single releases at close to full price to induce if not force and compel Bernstein fans to buy into him once again, I hope this edition is the promise of more comprehensive work to come, like vocal music.  I look forward with eager anticipation to a prospective companion choral works box set with such gems as Lenny's rendition of Bach's ST. MATTHEW PASSION as well as his unique rendition of MESSIAH.

B003UTUQ3E|5.0|This is how classic albums should be re-released:    Remixed for killer sound, in a tasty box with excellent photos, and a bonuse live concert disc of the Thin White Duke and his crack band in their prime.    If you don't know mid-70's Bowie, this is the place to start.  From the opening guitar train wreck of \\"Station To Station\\" to Bowie's cover of \\"Wild is the Wind\\" (perhaps his most haunting and amazing vocal ever), this is a classic in every sense of the word.    If you're a fan and you already have an earlier version of this CD, well worth your while to upgrade to this new set.    If you're not a fan, why are you reading this?    A must-have for all Bowie-philes.  Period.
0061989142|2.0|Easy read.  As have worked in retail for several years, I was familiar with most of the information in the book.  What I did learn was how to hem a pair of pants which was different to many other style books I have come across in the past.  Would recommend if someone needs some help developing their own style...
B002VECMAO|1.0|I watch a lot of movies, I love movies.  All kinds of movies high brow and low brow, just passing time movies and movies so dull I couldn't stay awake to movies so action-packed I couldn't get to sleep . . .  and yet I can say with absolute certainty that this is the absolute worst movie ever !!!! I saw the reviews, I was warned - but I've often watched movies canned by critics and found them at the very least somewhat entertaining and I thought at worst, this will \\"eye candy\\" - I mean - there are some very attractive actors in this movie - some very talented actors - how bad could it really be?  BAD, BAD, SO VERY BAD!  So bad, I don't think I will ever forgive clooney, bridges, mcgregor and the rest of these previously beloved actors.  I cannot begin to describe the horribleness of this movie.  the fact that some people have actually rated this movie above 1 star is shocking and makes me sad for humanity and wonder if the end of civilization really isn't near.      Do not even make the mistake of watching this with a \\"so bad, its funny\\" philosophy, because it's not - it's bad.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|Words are not enough to describe how beautiful this album is. In fact its not even fair to call it \\"album\\" because its nothing but a piece of art.   While being faithful to their message and style they get to create this new futuristic concept which acts as a playground and catalyst for an amazing adventure through the devastated desert of California during the year 2019.   Overall the ride is unbelievable and as a whole this product is a must get not only for the biggest my chemical romance fans but for anyone who appreciates art in its purest beauty.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban has recorded another wonderful CD. The first time I listened to Illuminations I was surprised at how different it was from Josh's other CDs. Being a fan, I had listened to the songs from Closer and Awake so often that those beautifully orchestral songs were the ones I grew to love. Here was something different, something that I wasn't used to hearing from Josh. After a second and third listen I was enthralled once again with how each song spoke to me in a different way and how each evoked a different feeling. Standouts for me are Galileo, War at Home, Higher Window, and Love Only Knows. The beautiful lyrics and the raw emotion from Josh's voice lets me know just how much of himself Josh put into this CD. It is wonderful to see an artist stretch himself musically and Josh does that so well with Illuminations. I congratulate him for his musical growth and I can't wait to hear more from the man with the stunning voice.
0307473465|4.0|After seeing the movie, I was looking forward to reading the book to tie up some large loose ends.  While the book was more insightful, I was still left with unanswered questions and no real sense of closure.    The story takes place 30 years or so in post World War II Germany and uses the Holocaust as the backdrop for a plot that centers around a passionate and yet mysterious love affair between an attractive 36 year old woman, Hanna Schmitz who befriends a 15 year boy, Michael Berg on the way home from school when he falls ill.  Michael is soon bewitched by the older woman and an obsessive love affair blossoms. Hanna delights in being read aloud to from various literature classics that Michael is studying in high school and over time this becomes something of a ritual that unites the two. As their relationship deepens, however, he is puzzled by her bouts of moodiness and at times secretiveness.  Some months later, Hanna abruptly and mysteriously quits her job and leaves town with no word of where or why she has gone.      Flash forward 10 years and Michael, a law student, is assigned to attend a local trial of 5 woman charged as Nazi war criminals, accused of unspeakable crimes against prisoners while serving as prison guards at a Nazi death camp.  Much to his horror, Michael discovers that Hanna is one of the defendants.  However, during the trial, he also discovers a secret that Hanna has been hiding for years that may explain, although not condone, her behavior as a prison guard and as his lover.    What follows is a deep psychological exploration by Michael into the motives and drives behind both those who participated in the Holocaust and those who committed no atrocities and yet passively turned a blind eye to the crimes both during and after the war.      Although the plot is very good, I never really learned why the primary characters failed to act or speak up at crucial times when doing so could have easily lessened the burdens that haunted them.  While many may argue that this was precisely the message of the book I still found the lengths to which this occurred to be unreasonable given the specifics the story provides, especially with regards to Michael's inactions later in the book.  I felt like the story could have been much more satisfying had the author provided more insight into what Hanna was truly thinking and feeling as well as why Michael failed to make more of an effort to understand Hanna rather than just lamely guess at why she acted the way she did.
B00000K2VZ|5.0|Pearl,\\" (1971), is one of the most legendary of recordings.  It was, sadly, posthumously released, as Janis Joplin, its greatly-talented maker, died of a heroin overdose on October 4, 1970, at the age of 27, as she was finishing it up.  She left her vocal to \\"Buried Alive in the Blues\\" unsung; so that it was released on the record as an instrumental by Full-Tilt Boogie, the backing band she'd put together for herself, which most people preferred to Big Brother and the Holding Company, the San Francisco-based psychedelic blues rock band with which she first became popular.<br /><br />\\"Pearl\\" is bluesy, funky, driving, much like its troubled maker, and will have to stand as her memorial.  It has powerful tracks of \\"Cry Baby,\\" and a live \\"Try (Just a Little Bit Harder,\\" and a witty acapella \\"Mercedes Benz.\\"  \\"A Woman Left Lonely,\\" and Bobby Womack's \\"Trust Me,\\" are gritty blues.  \\"A Woman Left Lonely,\\" was, I believe, described by Time magazine as music to which a girl might cut her wrists.  Kris Kristofferson's \\"Me and Bobby McGee,\\" of course, became her signature song: it was her only number one hit, achieved posthumously.<br /><br />I actually was once able to see Janis live, with \\"Big Brother,\\" performing the [[ASIN:B00000K2VU Cheap Thrills (Exp)]] repertory, at a famous venue of the time, Bill Graham's Fillmore East, on New York's Lower East Side.  All these years later, I still remember the expectant hush when the house lights went down, the sweet aroma of various illegal substances, and Joplin's electrifying performance.  It was quite a night, I can tell you.  Nobody will ever have that chance again, but the recordings remain.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|When I originally heard \\"Na Na Na\\", I was afraid that this album would be their downfall. The song grew on me over time and now it is one of my favorite tracks. Then \\"Sing\\" came out and it was the same reaction again...\\"uh oh.\\" I didn't know what to expect when I bought this, but I decided to give them chance since I do love the past three albums. I am very happy to say that this record is amazing. Danger Days may not be as strong as their previous album, but it could just be that I haven't listened to it long enough for it to be up there. Still, I really do recommend this album to all of the MCR fans. This is one of the best albums of the year. It didn't let me down like others have this year.
0439023513|3.0|spoiler alert. slight rant.    Ok, so Katniss ends up with Peeta. I could get it; I would have gotten it if Collins had taken the time to expound on the obvious fact that being a participant in the Hunger Games changes you. Thus, the indispensable bond btw Peeta and Katniss. They don't want to see any more deaths; they've had to kill innocents themselves.    Gale, on the other hand, thirsts for retribution for the bombing of District 12. He played a major role in saving the citizens.    So Katniss and Gale. Could have worked. Maybe never would have.    I, personally, would have liked to see a more definitive argument presented by Collins herself.    Don't even get me started on the entire pace of the war.
0060899220|4.0|I am a big fan of Anthony Bourdain and \\"No Reservations.\\" A friend of mine recently got me hooked on this show. The same friend has also read all of his books and told me to start with this one. After seeing him on the show and things that he eats, I probably should not have been surprised by some of his explanations in the book. At times, the explanations border on gross (there are certain items that I will think twice about eating or locations that I will think twice before going there) but it was very informative at the same time. He explains the behind-the-scene aspect of the culinary world very well. After working in a restaurant, I thought I knew a lot about this world. I was wrong! There are so many things that go into being a chef, owning a restaurant, or simply working in one. I recommend this book and can't wait to start reading his other works.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|\\"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\\" is a wonderful exploration and presentation of modern Celtic music. Compared with some of her other work, these songs are perhaps more focused on Celtic music's northern European roots in that they don't explore the broader, though related, themes - Spanish and Middle Eastern influenced - that are in some of Loreena McKennitt's other pieces. These nine songs are exceptionally well crafted and reflective of a truly skilled musician who explores the depths and richness of Celtic music. A soulful and fine presentation by this gifted artist.
B00447G2T8|5.0|I love this band.  Helloween just keeps coming with all they've got.  This album is by far the heaviest and fastest that they've done.  Now for those who haven't heard them before, this band has a similar sound to Judas Priest or Iron Maiden.  They've had a long run, since 1987 and are still some of the best musicians metal has to offer.  They've transitioned through a few singers before finally reaching Andi Deris who has vocalized the last several albums and done quite well in my opinion.  There are many people who say the original singer (Michael Kiske) is the best and his work is quite good as well, so was Kai Hansen who took that position for a time (now lead singer and guitarist of Gamma Ray), but Andi Deris produces the vocals now and that isn't about to change anytime soon.  I've enjoyed darn near everything they've produced and this latest work was up to standards and then some.  Now as far as information I needed from Amazon, and this was a minor annoyance, the album doesn't come with the lyrics in the book.  It's more or less just pictures of the band portraying the theme of the cd and it tells you that you have to look up the lyrics online (and where of course).  Now this is kind of a bad move by the label but not detrimental.  I would've just rather had the lyric book so I could learn the song and sing along, but they didn't give us a choice and Amazon didn't mention this when I bought it.  Now would it have stopped me from buying the album?  No.  However, it would have been a nice footnote.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|The Tunnel of Love Tour was the first time I saw Springsteen and it was the first concert that I went to with friends and no parents.  The show was a night that I will never forget and for that Springsteen will always be special to me.  This set has been such a gift.  The CDs and DVDs are fantastic and show more of the uncut Bruce than studio albums produce.  I could go on and on about it but many of the other reviews have already do so.  The packaging to make it look like a notebook is extremely clever.   If you are a Springsteen fan or think you would like to be one, get this box set.  It's well worth the money.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Harrison Ford stars in the dystopian noir set several years into the future. Blade Runner is one of the few movies that has managed to withstand the test of time on a visual level as well as a remain one of the most, dare I say, innovative title's that have ever graced my audio/visual senses. The movie itself is one of exploration into futuristic themes such as identity and love in a world where artificial beings called \\"Replicants,\\" being banned on Earth, are virtually identical to human beings. Rick Deckard (Ford) is a retired detective, or as the title suggests \\"Blade Runner\\" who is hired once again to hunt down several rampant Replicants. The movie stands as a character study of both Deckard and several replicants as they struggle to grasp the concept of life and its value.<br /><br />It's not so much about being futuristic as it is about creating a noir-esque atmosphere for which the characters can develop in, it just so happens that it does this in such an efficient manner that it comes off as wholly believable on every level. Looking at the film you can definitely see the 80's influence, though this film does not struggle to go above and beyond film's of it's genre even today, as it surpasses most recent sci-fi flicks. I found the subtle 80's feel to be very delightful, especially as it shines through in Vangelis' absolutely amazing soundtrack, which without, the movie would only be a shell of what it is.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray five disc Complete Collector's Edition has enough extras to keep your Blade Runner hunger at bay as it features every version of the film released including both narrated and non narrated versions with deleted scenes that escalate the Blade Runner atmosphere ever so much higher.<br /><br />Blade Runner stands as one of the few films, if not the only film, that I have ever seen that turned out to be more than one hundred percent satisfactory on every possible detail that could be reviewed. My only hope is that you, the doubtful reader of reviews, can at least rent this masterpiece and enjoy it as much as I have.rent this masterpiece and enjoy it as much as I have.
B001NXBRJG|1.0|snore snore.  I wanted to like this film.  I was psyched for an intelligent VR themed movie.  THis was NOT that movie.<br /><br />All I know is that the future consists of sunglass-wearing leather=clad slo-mo folk.  Why they dress this way is beyond me.  I guess jeans and tee shirts do not exist in the future.<br /><br />Oh, and those sunglass wearers was already done in the OMega Man--it was goofy there and is more goofy resurrected here.<br /><br />This was a sadly thought out, ill-conceived film<br /><br />If Bill Gates had been the star, it would have made it 2000% more exciting (and that is a sad commentary)<br /><br />Not surprisingly, most of the \\"positive\\" reviews have to do with the EFX.

B002ZG98UA|5.0|This is one of those movies where the 3-D was not added in post-production. It showed, too, as the movie progressed and you followed the adventures of Alice and the people she finds. Tuning in this time, the zombies seem to be running more of the world and Umbrella seems to be getting bigger by the moment. alice seems to be on a revenge trip, too, taking it to Umbrella for a bit before turning her attentions elsewhere. Her elsewhere is toward the survivors she sent into the middle of nowhere, hoping they would find something besides death. When she gets there, however, she finds a lot more than she bargained for.<br /><br />for people that have been following the series, this movie fitsa in well. I've seen a lot of people talk about some of the ideas thrown out here with disdain, but this was a good movie in my eyes. It only has a bit of alice doing the whole Umbrella shooting notions from the commercials, then it tunes into more important ideas. Fans of the games will enjoy some of the people that pop up, too, because they are nice.<br /><br />As far as the creatures are concerned, the beginning was a little bit devoid of contact. this changes, however, as Alice drifts toward some survivors and finds that they've changed. They personally remind me of RE:4 enemies placed on the screen, showcasing just how horrid something like that can be. a new bigboy joins the field, too, placing his axe in places where people won't like it - in their skulls and other places. Combine that with the effects that seem to go along smoothly and it really is action packed.<br /><br />If you've followed the series, you really have no reason not to like this movie. Even if one or two of them put you off, perhaps this is your gateway back in. I am not a fan of 3-D in movies, seeing a gimmick in it, but this is one of those rare examples where something like this works. You see things in it that show you what 3-D should be and you have a nice story and the motion of the characters as they keep on keeping on. Its good stuff even if it sometimes has to go over-the-tp to get there.ood stuff even if it sometimes has to go over-the-tp to get there.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The last time I was in the movie theater I saw a preview for The Social Network and immediately put its opening date in my calendar. Now it's opening weekend and I already rushed to my nearest screening to see the movie about the website that has defined my generation. For those of you reading this out there...drop your computers, turn off your Blackberries, silence your iPhones and run to your nearest theater to see this film. Whether the story presented in the movie is 100% truthful, who knows. And honestly, who cares!    As some may know, Mark Zuckerberg created Facebook during his sophomore year at Harvard University with the help of his best friend Eduardo Saverin (you can look them up on facebook.com). The movie presents Zuckerberg as being a loner with few friends who wants desperately to be a part of the Pheonix Club on campus. When the popular crew team twins, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, approach Zuckerberg about making a social connection website for Harvard students, Zuckerberg jumps at the opportunity. Zuckerberg enlists the financial help of Saverin and begins to build thefacebook based on the Winklevoss' idea. Thefacebook becomes an instant success and Zuckerberg is rocketed into stardom. Soon he is entertaining the likes of Sean Paker, Napster founder, and before long is the target of multiple lawsuits.    Of course we all know the success of Facebook and the great drama that surrounds its founders. Still, I was never fully aware of its development and the possible corruption in its founding. The movie portrays Zuckerberg as emotion-less and obsessed with being noticed by the \\"in\\" crowd even if it means sacrificing his only friends. The film bounces between his legal battles and the history of Facebook which took a bit of getting used to but I think that it worked. The acting is excellent and though Zuckerberg doesn't come off as being such a great guy, the movie does solicit some sympathy for him.    I think that this is an important movie not justbecause the script is tight, the acting is excellent, and the subject matter is timely, but also because the influence that Facebook (and Zuckerberg) have had on society is tremendous. Six years ago, no one would ever have thought that the word \\"friend\\" could be turned into a verb or that one could experience someone else's party or vacation by sitting on their own couch hundreds of miles away. Now someone can \\"friend\\" another person or be \\"defriended\\" and pictures can be uploaded to facebook so that people you're not even friends with can comment on pictures of your birthday. It's a kind of revolution that we still don't fully understand and possibly won't for many years. Still, this film reminds us that Facebook is just another website and therefore just another business laden with growing pains and legal troubles. While it did, for a second, make me want to deactivate my facebook (my sentiments were shared by my friend who went to see the film with me) I don't think that's the point of the film. Its message is not anti-facebook but merely proves that it is not God's gift to man. Instead, it was created as a means to distract Zuckerberg from his breakup with his girlfriend and which in turn has helped to distract over 150 million from around the world.
B001NLL93W|4.0|Cassandra Clare's books are really very entertaining - the first book I read was The Clockwork Angel, which I strongly recommend. Hers are fast-paced books with attractive plots and relationships, albeit rather superficial.<br /><br />Now- at this point I'm sucked in to my elbows so I'm going to buy this anyway, but I'm a bit peeved that this costs more than the paperback. Would anyone care to explain this for me?
B000NVIXFK|4.0|It's been a long road for Rush since the early 1980s.  All Rush albums, even the worst (1987's \\"Hold Your Fire\\" and 1996's \\"Test for Echo\\") have had at least one good track (usually the first).  It's been a while, though, since the better part of a Rush album has featured material worth listening to more than once.  \\"Signals\\" (1982), though sometimes maligned by fans for kicking off the \\"synth period,\\" may be one of the bands strongest albums.  \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" (1984) is stronger than most remember.  \\"Power Windows\\" (1985) -- \\"synth Rush\\" to the max -- in fact balances some forgettable tracks with a few surprisingly strong ones.  The late '80s and early '90s, though, were almost totally forgettable.  \\"Presto\\" (1989) didn't offer much other than \\"Show Don't Tell\\" (the opener) and 1991's \\"Roll the Bones\\" again had the fantastic opener (\\"Dreamline\\") and not much else(though \\"Ghost of a Chance,\\" the closest Rush has ever come to soul and jazz, is shockingly good).  1993's \\"Counterparts\\" is celebrated by fans as returning to the band to its hard rock roots.  This is true.  In terms of pure songwriting, however, the album didn't offer much beyond \\"Animate,\\" \\"Stick it Out\\" and \\"Cut to the Chase.\\"  By the time they arrived at \\"Test for Echo\\" (1997), it was tempting to think the band was creatively finished.  And, indeed, the band was forced into a hiatus because of the death of the drummer's daughter and wife.  The band's comeback was \\"Vapor Trails\\" (2002).  It was a new Rush; the sound lacked angular prog rock edges  and individual vituosity seemed lost behind a heavy wall of sound.  The heaviness was not totally unwelcome, however.  \\"Vapor Trails\\" held a metal punch generally absent since works like \\"2112\\" (1976).  The album may also have broken some ground in terms of melodic explorations and tonal spectrums.    \\"Snakes and Arrows,\\" however, is the Rushiest Rush album since \\"Moving Pictures\\" (1981). It is also the album most willing to touch on the metal/prog rock/art rock blend that has been at the heart of the band since \\"12.\\"  Indeed, between the two albums, \\"Moving Pictures\\" is the more sophistocated; songs like \\"Red Barchetta\\" simply represent, along with pieces by Yes, King Crimson and Pink Floyd, some of the most sophistocated songwriting and musicianship in rock since the genre became serious art in the 1960s.  Nonetheless, there's a connection to the dark side of the metal movement present in \\"12\\" that has always meant something to the band's sound. The victory of \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is to take elements from both of those albums and make them relavent again in the twenty-first century.  Not all tunes are winners.  But while not a concept album, \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" tells some kind of story.  And it does so with the polished, inventive and unique musicianship that makes you point at your stereo and say, \\"Now that's RUSH!\\"  With the dirth of real prog rock on major labels, that's a pleasure to say.    \\"Far Cry,\\" the album's opening track, is an out and out Rush tune.  If perhaps not quite as memorable as \\"Tom Sawyer\\" (what, after all, is?), \\"Cry\\" sits together with \\"Sawyer,\\" \\"Animate,\\" \\"Spirit of Radio\\" and \\"Subdivisions\\" as one of the group's truly great anthemic tracks.  Lightening drum fills, good lyrics (often a hit and miss proposition with Rush) and (quoting a Rolling Stone article) a \\"stallion groove,\\" \\"Far Cry\\" is a topical tune that uses 1970s instrumental virtuosity to create a 21st century sound.  It's the band at its best. \\"Far Cry\\" embodies a long career which may, in fact, be coming into a whole new phase.    This simultaneously pointing fowards and back characterizes much of the rest of \\"Snakes and Arrows.\\"   Totally undanceable yet somehow intriguingly odd time signatures were long a band signature, and they return (among other places) in \\"Faithless.\\"  This tune will have junior guitarists and bass players sitting in their bedrooms with sheet music counting eighth notes.  One also gains a touch of the surprisingly beautiful melodicness of the group (think \\"Red Barchetta,\\" \\"Something for Nothing\\" or \\"The Analogue Kid\\").  Indeed, the bass/drum groove at the tune's start and its shift to driving guitar in another time signature might mark some of the band's best musical work in a couple of decades.  It's another victory of blending the old and the new.    Both fans and casual listeners will recognize that Rush always had a little of the \\"rock became serious when longhairs started saying important things with acoustic guitars\\" dimension to them(the same impulse permeating the folksy side of Zeppelin).  It's nice to hear that dimension of Rush return a bit with Alex Lifeson's acoustic ode, \\"Hope.\\"  Lifeson is an interesting guitarist.  If one combs the Rush oeuvre, one finds songs in which he's every bit the match of latter-day guitar heroes like Eddie van Halen, Steve Vai or Joe Satriani.  But Lifeson often diminishes himself; since the end of Rush's first heavy period in the '70s and early '80s, Lifeson has offered few solos or improvisations.  This has  been to the detriment of many Rush albums.  \\"Hope\\" is not an acoustic masterpiece in the rock genre.  It's pretty, though, and skilled.  One gains a sense of rock history and appreciates Lifeson as a guitarist with direct power and prosaicness.    For those who worship Niel Peart -- and that's almost all who have ever held a drumstick and thought that rock was their thing -- one almost starts every new Rush track anticipating what kind of dizzying, near-incomprehensible Olympian fills the master of the massive drum kit is going to throw in .  That makes it sometimes difficult to admit that songs like \\"Animate\\" succeed in part because Peart pulls back from complexity in favor of simplicity.  Such is the case with \\"We Hold On\\" -- a rare track buried at the tail end of a Rush album that absolutely rocks.  Rythmically simple while muscularly prog, \\"We Hold On\\" features the band reflecting a bit on its own legacy as well as that of any who have made something work collectively over a number of decades.  Peart once again delivers good lyrics; crisp Rush playing on the less complex end of their spectrum makes for a tune you'll flip to again and again.    The album's two instrumentals, \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" and \\"The Main Monkey Business,\\" are good. \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" is especially tasty. The tune is all Rush instrumental -- fast, intense, hot licks and great tonalities.  \\"Malignant Narcisissm\\" is every bit as good as \\"YYZ, just minus the hot Lifeson solo.  \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" brings fewer pyrotechnics but a convincing latter-day prog atmosphere.    Among the other tracks, \\"Bravest Face\\" represents particularly strong songwriting -- and there, in the midst of an interestingly folky manifestation of the Rush sound, one gets Lifeson spinning some suprisingly strong solo riffs.  Other tunes, \\"Spindrift,\\" \\"Good News First\\" and \\"The Way the Wind Blows\\" offer some excellent grooves and moments.  In this listener's opinion, however, those songs don't always hang together or represent great listening through to the end.  \\"Armor and Sword\\" is heavy and grows on you.  That growing takes some time, however.  And, unfortunately, \\"The Larger Bowl\\" represents one of the too frequent phenomena on recent Rush albums -- a totally vanilla song that should have been left next to the recording studio mixer.    Can one say that Rush was ever gone?  Revisiting any of their greatest hits albums will remind listeners that while Rush is a band with more than a few utterly forgettable songs (most of \\"Hold Your Fire\\" or \\"Test for Echo,\\" for example), the group also has some of the incomparable moments in rock history.  \\"Tom Sawyer,\\" \\"Red Barchetta,\\" \\"Xanadu,\\" \\"Freewill,\\" and \\"The Trees\\" may not be totally unique, but along with more recent classics such as \\"Dreamline\\" and \\"Animate,\\" Rush can make your jaw drop and force you to admit that one simply has to give it up for a band that won't stop rocking.Nonetheless, for either hardcore fans or the general rock afficianado, it's been a long time since Rush has produced an album one could listen to from start to finish with total satisfaction.  One can discuss whether or not \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is 100% that album.  It's darn close,however -- and if you take rock seriously, this is an album that deserves a place in your collection.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|So, back when `808's and Heartbreak' was dropped everyone and their mother was raving about it as one of the better, more experimental rap albums of all time.  It just didn't sit right with me.  I think I gave it an overall C-grade and I stand by that, despite the fact that `Heartless' is still a pretty great song.  With that in mind, I wasn't too keen on jumping all over `My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy'.  When you combine my thoughts on his last album with my thoughts on his persona in general you kind of have a recipe for disaster.<br /><br />I just don't like him.<br /><br />That said; I was blogging today with some friends and I came across a thread dedicated to this album and I read a few raves that got me interested in picking this up (SALE!!!) and giving it a spin.  I was so intrigued by the brilliance of the albums opening track that I decided to live blog my initial reaction to the album track for track.<br /><br />Here is my post:<br /><br />\\"So I just listened to `Dark Fantasy'...great opener...I was iffy about this album, but it seems to be a step back into better territory for West, that is, if the opening track is really any indication.<br /><br />My interest is peaked...onto `Gorgeous'.<br /><br />So, just finished `Gorgeous'...I thought that the grungy feel would be a turn off, but it really grew on me...I liked the muffled old school rock vibe, and West's rhymes are sharp this go around.<br /><br />Now, onto `Power' (seriously, I've only heard this song once, a live performance on some award show I think)...<br /><br />Why is it that Kanye's arrogance, while so offputting on his actual persona, translates so well into a song? `Power' is great. I especially love the ending, which took the whole track up a notch for me.<br /><br />As I'm typing this I'm listening to the Interlude for `All Out Of Lights'...it's rather beautiful.<br /><br />I didn't expect this from Kanye...and I totally know that this post is going to get ridiculous if I keep updating it after I listen to every track, but I already started and I don't know if I can stop myself.<br /><br />I'm kind of conflicted on `All Of The Lights'...it's a little uneven and kind of chaotic and I can't tell if I like that or if it is a deterrent. Rihanna is superb as usual, and the first part of the bridge is great, while the second part (that female rap stint) is a little off for me. I can't take Kanye 'auto-tune' and he kind of goes there a tad in verses, but overall I like the song.<br /><br />I'm halfway through `Monster' and it is already my favorite track on that album.<br /><br />O<br />M<br />G<br />Do I hear Nicki Minaj?  Yes, this track is fricking epic!<br /><br />The guest list on `So Appalled' is insane, and for the most part they all really work well...but the sum of it's parts is better than the whole, which is kind of uneven and unfocused and I really hate the way they all say 'ridiculous'...I mean, it was like nails on a chalk board after a while...ouch...<br /><br />The vintage, old school R&B musicality of `Devil in a New Dress' was a nice touch, and the mid-song musical interlude of sorts was cool, but the ending guest vocals seemed unnecessary. I mean, I don't get the idea that every song needs to have 'help'...Kanye is more than capable to carry the majority of this album on his own.<br /><br />The 9 minute running time of `Runaway' seems daunting, but so far I'm liking what I'm hearing (it feels like '808's and Heartbreak' only better)...<br /><br />Yeah...9 minutes be darned, the track is pretty stellar...even with the 3 minute (or there abouts) run on at the end.<br /><br />There's nothing really special about `Hell Of A Life', but for an above average generic rap track it works, especially the second half where the musical aspect of the track goes through some nice variations.<br /><br />Ha, ok...'Blame Game' is all sorts of perfection. Even the fact that the track goes from darkly serious to Chris Rock elements of comical, it all works really well...and the piano was a really eloquent touch. Thematically, it's honest and yet it has really great slivers of humor that detach it in all the right places.<br /><br />But seriously, why is there not one normal length track here?<br /><br />Ok, just finished it. `Lost in the World' was odd. The tribal, African theme running through was an odd fit. Totally not my thing, but whatever...good for him I guess.<br /><br />I did like the `Who Will Survive In America' outro though...it kind of laid an obvious context on the album...<br /><br />So, this is just my initial thought here, but this album is pretty genius. The high's are ridiculously high, and the lows are still engaging and listenable...there is not a single `bad' track here...'Monster' may be one of the best rap songs to come out in YEARS!\\"<br /><br />So, I was advised that `All Of The Lights' was one of the best tracks on the album, and so I decided to give it another listen.  I still feel slightly conflicted, but I will say that the second go around definitely has me leaning towards the `it works' side of things.  It is notably flawed, but there are parts of this song that are glimmers of sheer brilliance (especially the musical arrangement that pounds the background).  I'm pretty confident that after a few more listens I'll see what everyone else does.<br /><br />I'm almost there.<br /><br />Oh, so, in case you need me to spell it out for you:<br /><br />B-U-Y T-H-I-S A-L-B-U-M B-E-C-A-U-S-E I-T I-S B-R-I-L-L-I-A-N-T!t places.

B004BSAEQC|1.0|This album really has no longevity, after I listened to this album a few times I asked myself what did I like about it so much? At least she knows how to advertise.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I saw the movie first, and when the opening of the movie started off with the song of Obliviate I was captured by it. I looked for the soundtrack and listened to it and, at first, I felt there was nothing more to it.<br /><br />But now, almost two years later, I listened to this soundtrack carefully, without rush, without expecting anything bombastic or imposing, and I found an intimate, emotional and magical world. It might be difficult to accept that for such a big blockbuster movie, Alexandre Desplat wrote a small intimate and subtle score. But the varied emotions and well arranged melodies that accompany this ride are just so warm and real that it takes you to that magical world with a more mature attitude than before (after all, the characters are not kids anymore and their lives have changed a lot since the first movies so the score must also be different).<br /><br />I now love it. Highlight tracks:<br /><br />1. Obliviate<br />2. Godric's Hollow Graveyard<br />3. At the burrow<br />4. Harry and Ginny<br />5. Ron Leaves<br />6. Ron's Speech<br />7. Farewell to Dobby<br />8. Hermione's parents<br />9. Snape to Malfoy Manor<br />10. Ministry of Magic<br />11. Lovegood<br />12. Polyjuice Potion<br />13. Death Eaters<br />14. The Deathly Hallows<br /><br />Thanks Alexandre Desplat. You are always loyal to your own way of writing... intimate and personal. Sometimes this music is the most reassuring.
B002C1BHIO|5.0|It's kinda hard to judge a cable but I will say it's braided cable which is good for shielding signals, gold contacts, plenty of length (6 1/2 ft), and you need high-speed for today's devices (1080p).I used mine for a connection from my Denon Receiver to my Samsung tv & I am pleased with the connection. You can't spend $ on electronics then blow it with cheap speaker wire or cable connections!
B0041VV03A|2.0|All I have to say is ....this movie had potential but it fell short big time. The story was so disjointed and aimless . I soon realized that it was all just an excuse to show off the special effects that created this creature . Which brings me to something else that bugged me .... what the hell was she supposed to have been spiced with , I mean she had kangaroo legs and cockroach wings WTH...SMH. And the the \\"Piece de resistance\\"  THE SEX SCENE WITH \\"DREN\\" ...I guess from this ,one must glean that a dude with stick his willy just about anywhere . I hated this movie , and wish I could get a refund of my time. And wow what a step down for Adrien Brody.
B001CSS4V6|5.0|This movie is perfection.  I don't know how or why this movie got overlooked.  Maybe marketing, maybe because Disney wasn't behind it.<br /><br />Special affects were great.  CHild and adult actors were stellar, Was Dark but lighthearted.<br /><br />Was seriously worthy of an Oscar.  It's a shame that not many saw this.
B003X2O6KW|4.0|I'm fully aware of how important this album is in the grand scheme of things. After this, the entire culture will be transformed. Kanye West has turned hip-hop into great postmodern art.     But with that said, I still think this album is somewhat overwrought. It's too monumental for its own good. It would have been better with some editing. A lot of the songs worked better in condensed format as a part of the \\"Runaway\\" film (which btw, was a great piece of cinematic art). I came close to giving this album 5 stars, but with that small fraction missing, I have to settle for 4 stars. It is great, but it tries a bit too hard to become legendary. A bit like Kanye West himself. There is a great postmodern artist somewhere in him, I just wish all of his work could be of the same caliber as the \\"Runaway\\" film.     This album still holds some of the greatest music of our time, and perhaps the imperfections will make it stand the test of time, in the long run. No matter what, hip-hop will never be the same, nor will culture or art as a whole. That's no small feat.
B004BSIJ9Q|2.0|I know some think he's a \\"musical genius\\" but this...this right here....this is some mess. I will admit I only listened to the snippets but based on the snippets I declined even at the awesome price of $3.99. I know Kanye is trying to take it there but he's going somewhere I don't want to go :-( Nothing stands out to me...boring...not even anything okay but catchy.....waiting on someone to \\"bring it\\" in this sad state of music we're in now.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki Minaj has been one of the most unique and interesting voices in culture for a while now. As this will be her breakthrough into a wider cultural sphere - and make her a part of the contemporay consciousness - I´m very happy to see how she has dealt with the challenge. This album is truly amazing. A great, interesting varied concoction. The impact of this album on contemporary culture will be immense. Minaj is a postmodern visionary.    My favorite song on the album is without-a-doubt the crushing \\"Did it on ´em\\". Which must be the most banging song of 2010. But really, all the songs on this album are stellar. Pink Friday is an instant classic!
0439023513|4.0|This book was darker than I expected it to be.  I thought it was an apprioriate ending to the trilogy, but I gave it only 4 stars because of the ending. I felt the ending was rushed and important details were skipped.  The pardoning of Katniss, the replacement of the new president, etc. seemed to be thrown in as details when they would have made a more detailed and full conclusion if some more time had been spent pulling all the details together.  Good book overall and still would reeommend the trilogy to anyone!

B000N4SADC|3.0|Just got myself a copy of Hiromi Uetara's Time Control. Got turned on to her by a muso friend of mine. Saw a few clips on Youtube and went mad about her. Specially 'Place to be' ... [...]. Amazing discipline combined with wonderful expressive ability. All too often, people who have undergone such rigorous training have the expressive stuffing knocked out of them. So many such musos end up drowning in technique and become deeply boring as a result. And of course the cliche of Japanese life is that it so conformist that it shrivels the creative impulse like a dried prune. All the more enticing then to see someone like Hiromi cutting up the keyboards and playing her heart out. Beautiful to watch. Having said that, however, I found I couldn't wade my way through Time Control in a single sitting. That's why I only gave it 3 stars. I don't retract anything I said about her - she is a wonderful musician and a great musical personality - but I think she is still young as a composer. In the end I found the pieces tiring to listen to. It's always risky getting a bunch of crack journeymen in a room and letting them rip. They've just got too much to prove. Unless you can rein it in, things can rapidly end up disappearing up the old fundamental. As they all too often did with the early jazz rockers such as Mahavishnu. So many notes, so little time. But Hiromi is a sweetheart. Perhaps best listened to solo. For now, I prefer the simplicity and elegance of her fellow countryman, Ryuichi Sakamoto ... [...].

0316172324|5.0|Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking by Malcolm Gladwell is an influential book that analyzes the decision making process in humans. The first part of the book deals with unconscious decision making. The book thoroughly describes the experiment done by a psychologist. He records the conversation of couples and can tell if they are going to be together in a few years or not. The psychologist analyzes different reactions of the partners and can tell if everything is right or something is going wrong. By doing this study for a long time he has come up with \\"four horseman\\" that can give information about a relationship. They are defensiveness, stonewalling, criticism and contempt. Even by listening to a couple's conversation for 30 seconds he can tell if they are going to make it or not.  It is also important to stress the fact that none of the partners know themselves how they react.  Then the author goes in more detail on unconscious decision making. The author believes that sometimes we are better off by making snap decisions then making decisions based on too much information. He uses the example of The Pentagon strategy game to illustrate this idea. The Blue Team representing United States that had an enormous system of information and The Red Team representing a rouge country that was very limited in information and communication. Despite these differences, the Red Team won because they used snap decisions made in the field while the Blue team was lost in the huge amount of information it had. Oftentimes  we believe that what we think is free will but in fact it is our unconscious that is doing everything for us.  As the author says : \\" Much of the time we are operating on automatic pilot.\\"  Then the Gladwell also talks about the downs side of quick judgment. We often judge people by their appearance and this can lead to a wrong conclusion. Warren Harding was a tall dark skinned man that imposed authority and respect. People voted him to become presidentof the United States because of these attributes while overlooking other most important elements required in a president. He came to be one of the worst presidents in the United States history.   Up to this point the author seemed to be contradicting himself. Should we trust our gut feeling or not?  Our first impressions may seem that snap decisions come from nowhere, but in fact our unconscious is making these very fast decisions based on our experience and on the environment we live in. By changing our experiences we can change our first impression judgments. So the core idea of the book is that we should trust our snap decisions and that experience improves our instant thinking. We should often make decisions based on our first impressions if we have a good amount of experience.

B000002GJH|5.0|For those who thought Audioslave was powerful, Temple of the Dog just blows it out of the water.  If you think Cornell did his best on lighter songs in Audioslave, well you haven't heard nothing yet.  It's a shame that this record isn't quite well known, but it's an absolutely powerful and soaring record.  Like the other originating bands from Seattle, Temple of the Dog is yet another workable alternative to Prozac, and features real emotion, real catharsis, and a real uplift that their millions of imitators don't have and never will.<br /><br />You probably know the story about this record right now.  Mother Love Bone's singer Andrew Wood died from a drug overdose and many of his fellow Seattle friends were devastated.  Temple of the Dog was a one shot deal featuring Soundgarden's Chris Cornell on vocals and Matt Cameron on drums, with Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, Stone Gossard, and Jeff Ament on Guitars.  Unlike the problematic Audioslave, the combo here pretty much meshes together well and naturally, creating a sound that, predictably, blends elements of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden.  Fortunately though, this record just doesn't sound like a second rate Perl Jam or Soundgarden, as it sounds totally natural in mixing and like a whole different band as it is.  Don't worry, if you like either band, you'll probably like this as well, just don't forget you're not getting merely a mish-mash of Pearl jam and Soundgarden.<br /><br />So what do you get in this record?  Well for one, Chris Cornell.  A few years ago, I would have cringed at the thought of this man taking a place among the best rock vocalists I've ever heard. Now, it's always incredible to hear to his voice, and at his prime few rock vocalists can match him to my ears.  This is one of his primes.  His voice is nothing short of AMAZING here.  He doesn't get as in your face with pure attitude as he does with Soundgarden, but other sides of him that you never thought possible.  He still uses that amazing banshee howel of his (though in a more traditional way than his venom sparked piercing screams of Soundgarden), and he sings absolutely amazing, as it's filled with life, is incredibly soulful, and full of dyanamic range.  And get this, he sometimes pairs the former with the latter!  The hype for his singing is no hyperbole.  Cornell is the main star of this record, and he relishes every moment of it and demands attention. Listening to this almost makes me wishes there was a time machine to get the early Cornell and sing the Audioslave songs at the time he mead this.  Imagine what Show Me How To Live would sound with Cornell on the microphone in the early 90's.  But I digress.<br /><br />The rest of the band itself do not slouch, and they are all great.  Matt Cameron is a much better drummer than Pearl Jam's original drummer, and while he's more subdued, he still has chances to shine with the pounding and glorious drumming or Reach Down, the interesting and groovy intro of Wooden Jesus, and the liveliness of Your Savior and Pushing Forward Back.  Pearl Jam's guitarists seem to play with a bit more focus than they did on Ten, and while it's nothing spectacular, they unleash great riffs and solos (barring some of the unfocused noodling in Reach Down), adding beautiful textures and snaky, great guitar riffs.<br /><br />This isn't quite a perfect record.  The ballads are absolutely jaw dropping as you might expect, although I have to admit, the rockers, while being excellent, don't nearly come close to the former (this comes from the fact that Pearl Jam is probably my least favorite of the seminal Seattle bands, though there great don't get me wrong).  And Reach Down starts absolutely amazing, but it does lose focus during the jam.  Still, these petty complaints don't stain the record. The score is incredibly high, like ALMOST a full five stars, so it doesn't matter much anyway.  Needless to say, this record is EXTREMELY impressive.  If you call yourself a fan of either Soundgarden, Chris Cornell, or Pearl Jam, and you haven't heard this yet, then what is the matter with you?  If it's the last album you buy and you're one of the above, then make it this one., and you haven't heard this yet, then what is the matter with you?  If it's the last album you buy and you're one of the above, then make it this one.

0393072231|5.0|This book is about the unrestrained greed of the financial services industry and Wall Street firms in particular.  Intially, Lewis tells us that his ealier work Liar's Poker created a rush of graduating college students wanting to join the \\"B.S.D's\\" of that book.Contrary to his intent, greed filtered his criticism making it a how-to-manual.     Despite the single mindedness of the banks, 10-20 individuals identified the impending crash of the adjustable rate subprime mortgage based bonds and CDO's. They were either outsiders to Wall Street, or followers of Greg Lippman a trader at Deutsche Bank(an insider company) who viewed himself as an outsider.  Among those we meet are Steve Eisman, Michael Burry, Eugene Xu, Charley Ledley, Jamie Mai and Meredith Whitney. Lewis uses their story as a framework for telling us who the bad guys were...and he does name names...and how they did it.      Lewis distinguishes between the earlier fixed rate subprime mortgages originated by private finance companies in the 1990's and the adjustable rate subprime mortgages of ten years later.  The banks learned from the mistakes of the earlier companies.  The finance companies went public, then bankrupt. The portion of the fixed rate mortgages they kept in-house defaulted.  Shareholders paid the price.    Beginning with Salomon Brothers in 1981, investment banks converted from partnerships to public corporations.  Once the former partners no longer had their own capital at risk, the greed superheated.  Risk passed to stockholders and to investors.  With huge fees and bonuses at stake, the banks gamed the ratings firms into AAA ratings for the adjustable rate subprime mortgage bonds and CDO's they packaged and sold.  Moody's, Standard & Poor's and Fitch knew they were being manipultated but it wasn't until much later that their ratings model started to change.  Once it became known that would happen, investment banks went into hyperdrive to get product out under the old ratings model.      The banks gamed investors.  By increasing the complexity of the derivatives banks made it more difficult for investors to penetrate the CDO's and derivatives...for them to know what they were buying.  With no historical record for the performance of the adjustable rate mortage based bonds and CDO's, investors relied on the word of the salesmen and traders.  By using teaser rates and the purchase of mortgage originators, investment banks were able to accelerate the creation of product for sale to investors.      Eisman and others repeatedly questioned their perceptions of product risk in the face of investment bank assurances that the derivatives were fail safe.  Attendance at industry conferences and an interview with Bear Stearns legend Alan \\"Ace\\" Greenberg were efforts to answer the question:  what do the sellers know that we don't know. The answer is found in the high fees investment banks made for origination of adjustable rate subprime mortgage, for creating the bonds and derivatives and for selling product to investors.    An example of the Wall Street disengagement from the market risk is found in a book written by Greenberg-The Rise and Fall of Bear Stearns.  He sat on the Bear Stearns Risk Committee.  He sold his shares in Bear Stearns as the firm became more involved in risky CDO's.  At one point he tells us how Stearns' President Jimmy Cayne \\"...was one of the few to ever lose a billion dollars in capital\\"  because Cayne had kept his shares until Bear Stearns' forced sale to J P Morgan. Greenberg had sold all of his before the sale.      Convinced of the true risks, Eisman and the others acting independently decided to bet against the bonds and derivatives through the purchase of insurance,a.k.a. credit default swaps.  At first they had trouble finding counterparties since no market existed.  Finally, AIGFP agreed to provide the insurance at a cost of fractions of a penny on the principle dollar amount.  With hundreds of billions of dollars of CDO's and derivatives insured, the millions in annnual premiums were viewed as \\"free\\" money by AIG.  Eisman and the others however felt it was just a matter of time until the teaser rates started to readjust and the defaults started.  Because of the way the CDO's were structured, a default rate of just 8% of the underlying mortgages could make the insurance on an entire individual CDO collectible...and by more than one party.    The excellence of The Big Short is Lewis' history of the suprime mortgage business including the 1990's experience and the meltdown through the interplay of those who saw through the smoke and mirrors so clearly they did not intially believe they understood the market correctly.  Those in the banks who originated the mortgages and packaged and sold the bonds and derivatives were rewarded with tens of millions in payroll fees and bonuses not unlike the 1st people in a chain letter scheme.  Lewis calls them out by name.      In closing the circle back to the theme of Liar's Poker, Lewis relates a recent dinner he had with former Salomon Bros. CEO John Gutfreund after the meltdown.  A small incident with deviled eggs underscores the lack of risk that investment banks had as they packaged and re-packaged derivatives of adjustable rate subprime mortgages.  In Lewis' words: something for nothing never loses its charm.
B00009ZYBY|5.0|Great movie to watch.  It is rich in history and an addictive plot to follow.  You really root for Maximus.
193413712X|5.0|This book is phenomenal. I loved every page...every sentence...every word. Exceptionally well written! The characters are well developed and the plot is fairly unique. It is not an action thriller, it is certainly a \\"slower\\" paced book but I feel in this day and age it's nice to get some rest from our crazy hectic world and find recluse in early woodsy America. There were passages that left me in awe at how someone could describe life so well...very insightful and eloquent.           Lately I have come upon such awful books that I feel every joe shmo with a plot that's \\"sellable\\" is given a book deal - don't get me started on that Twilight mess. This book was not even given a chance in the beginning; it was only through the support of local bookstores that it actually received some attention and now it's a Pulitzer winner! What a great Cinderella story!     Buy this book if you like to think & ponder on the meaning of life and aren't looking for an easy story fix. You won't regret it.

B003Q6D1Z6|3.0|So-would you believe me if I told you that showman P.T. Barnum, in point of fact, never actually uttered the words \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\"? You know how I found that out? I Googled it. It says, right here in the Wikipedia, that P.T. Barnum's \\"famous quote\\" never left his lips. And since I read it on the internet, it simply must be true, right?     In the documentary (-ish) Catfish, a buzz-generating entry at this year's Sundance, directors Ariel Schulman and Henry Joost ask their audience to suspend a lot of disbelief. In spite of a cast billed as playing themselves, and Universal's press kit trumpeting that \\"filmmakers\\" Schulman and Joost \\"...had no idea that their project would lead to the most exhilarating and unsettling months of their lives\\"- well, if this film is a \\"documentary\\"- then I have some beautiful beachfront property in Florida to sell you unseen.     But I could be wrong. Perhaps the events \\"documented\\" in this film did actually transpire as presented, and I'm just an embittered, mean old cynic who has seen too many movies. In fact, let's all play along just for a moment. Let's say that Schulman and Joost really were in the process of making a documentary-in-search-of-a-story, when it struck them that the \\"story\\" was right in front of them the whole time. Schulman's brother Nev, a professional photographer blessed with his own camera-friendly good looks, had struck up a social networking-based friendship with an artistically gifted 8 year old girl from Michigan, who initially intrigued him by snail-mailing strikingly mature oil paintings based on his photos. When the girl's 19 year old sister introduced herself into the mix, Nev struck up a web relationship with her as well; a relationship of a more involved and potentially amorous nature. Inevitably, Nev (now the official \\"subject\\" of his brother's doc) reached a point where he wanted to take the next logical step-and not necessarily for the reasons you might think (sorry about the vagueness; I'm trying to keep this as \\"spoiler-free\\" as possible). Suffice it to say that our intrepid NYC-based trio of dazzling urbanites-turned detectives are soon packing up their film gear and heading to Ted Nugent country for a surprise visit. Ah, but which of the parties involved in this bit of cyber-intrigue is in for the bigger surprise? I could tell you...but then I'd have to kill you.    I do have to hand it to the filmmakers-they have at the very least constructed a virtually critic-proof product. If one decries the possible fakery of the film, then the filmmakers could counter that the heart of the story is, after all, about the inherent deception of cyber romance (the old \\"So how do you know that the hot 19 year old college cheerleader you've been sexting isn't in reality a fat, middle-aged truck driver named Skip?\\" meme). Also, the film is billed as a \\"reality thriller\\"-which could be thrown back at critics as a caveat emptor (\\"Hey-we never exactly claimed that this was a documentary.\\"). Maybe I'm making a mountain out of a molehill, but in a post \\"Blair Witch Project\\" world I feel it is my duty to bring this up. Oh well...wasn't it Godard who said that \\"Cinema is the most beautiful fraud in the world.\\"?     If you can get past the \\"Is it real or Memorex\\" conundrum-this is not necessarily a bad film; it's intriguing enough to hold your interest through to the end. And if the point is to show how we have become a world of Walter Mittys and Eleanor Rigbys, spending the long dark nights of our souls pecking away on our keyboards, busily reinventing ourselves to assuage our lives of quiet desperation, then the film does convey a bittersweet poignancy in the denouement. And I have a confession to make. I don't have any Florida beachfront property for sale.
B00005JNDZ|4.0|Enjoyed this movie.  It is comedic and the cast does a great job of delivering that.  Easy to identify with the characters and situations.
B00427X9WI|2.0|You know, any schlub who has been to at least two world's fairs and a rodeo could have saved the protagonist of this film a lot of time and trouble by quoting Buckaroo Banzai's favorite adage:    Wherever you go, there you are.    Unfortunately for the audience, it takes the globe-trotting heroine of Ryan Murphy's film adaptation of Elizabeth Gilbert's memoir \\"Eat Pray Love\\" 133 minutes to reach that same conclusion (OK, so it took Tyrone Power 145 minutes in \\"The Razor's Edge\\"...but who's counting?)    Julia Roberts stars as Gilbert's avatar in the film, where she is briefly introduced to us as a (seemingly) happy, thirty-something NYC-based writer with a loving and supporting husband (Billy Crudup). I say \\"briefly introduced\\", because soon after a research trip to Bali, during the course of which a shaman (Hadi Subiyanto) foretells that she will lose all her money, but eventually return to study under him so that he may impart his great wisdom, Liz decides that she needs to bolt from the marriage (much to the puzzlement of husband and audience).     While the ink is still drying on her divorce papers (at least in screen time), Liz tumbles headlong into a relationship with a hunky young off-off Broadway stage actor (James Franco). The lust, however, soon turns to wanderlust, and Liz decides that maybe what she really needs is to take a year off from...everything. So, leaving her new relationship somewhere in the neutral zone, she embarks on a three-pronged attack in order to \\"find herself\\", first to Italy (eat), then India (pray) and then Bali (love...oops, is that a spoiler?)    So what does she learn? Want the speed-dating version? Here goes! In Italy, they have like, killer pasta and pizza. Awesome! And the gelato...it's to die for! Oh...and Italians live in the moment, and they talk with their hands...just like the people on Jersey Shore! And when Liz decides to treat her new Italian friends to an all-American style home-cooked Thanksgiving meal with all the trimmings, one of the Italians, being unfamiliar with our ways and customs, forgets to defrost the bird. But, not to worry-Liz puts it in the oven, they all go to bed, and then, they have turkey for breakfast. How whimsical! Next stop: India, where Liz learns piety by scrubbing floors at an ashram. Oh, and gurus live in the moment. Then, it's back to Bali, where she goes back to the shaman who started the whole thing (he lives in the moment). Then, she meets a sexy Brazilian! (Javier Bardem).    Roberts is suitably radiant, flashes her million dollar smile and delivers her patented hearty guffaws right on cue, but she oddly seems to spend a good portion of this (very long) film as an observer of her character's journey, rather than an active participant. Consequently, it's hard for us to really care about what happens to our leading lady; and that is a fatal flaw. The always wonderful Richard Jenkins (as another American at the ashram) briefly perks up the middle third. But as soon as his character disappears, so does the spirit and energy he brings to the film. The locales are gorgeous, and there's plenty of food porn for the gastronomiques, but that doesn't candy-coat Robert's phoned-in performance and the flat, soap opera-ish dialog (co-written by Murphy and Jennifer Salt). It's like randomly surfing between Lifetime, The Food Network and The Travel Channel.    I have not read the source book, nor frankly am I ever likely to. The Pottery Barn angst on display here is tough to sympathize with in these hard economic times (how many of us can afford the luxury of \\"taking a year off\\" to navel-gaze?), and seems bent on perpetrating the Ugly American meme. In fact, I thought that the depictions of the \\"colorful locals\\" encountered by the protagonist on her whistle stops bordered on the kind of colonial stereotyping I assumed Hollywood had abandoned ages ago. You know how they say that \\"It's not about the destination, it's about the journey\\"?  In this case, the trip couldnot be over soon enough.

0061120073|5.0|A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith isn't a novel about a dysfunctional family. It is a lullaby of a quiet corner in the city that never sleeps. It is a lullaby that whispers the joys, hardships, and love of a family that will forever be in my heart.<br /><br />The story revolves around Francie Nolan, a young girl growing up in Brooklyn in the early 1900s. She is one of the only true Americans on her blocks and is proud of it. Living on little food, Francie quenches her thirst for life through books and school. Her mother is a traditional housewife with a twist of rebellion. Her father is a man as magical and loving as he is drunk, living through a kaleidascope of wonder that he teaches his children to adore.<br /><br />Everything about A Tree Grows in Brooklyn was utterly enchanting. I truly connected with each character. It doesn't matter whether you're an eager young author, someone who has experienced a tragic loss, or simply someone who loves life, I believe there is a little bit of everyone in Francie Nolan. Everyone has that childlike need to live their dreams in an attempt to escape an imperfect reality. In fact, all of the Smith's characters are so terrific that it is hard to believe that they are 'ction. Their attitude, togetherness, and love are something that every family should strive to imitate. By the end of the novel, I began to miss the family that I had grown up with as if they were my own.<br /><br />Betty Smith's writing is full of wonderful portraits of the place she grew up. She displays the glory of New York City at a time when immigrants poured into America. Her prose make us feel the pride of Francie's neighbors when they leave their homeland, and the freedom they felt as their boats docked. Yet, along with these beautiful images, she portrays the struggles of so many people living in the small crowded islands of New York City. Betty Smith shows us the loves and losses of a new nation by painting a picture to rival Picasso.<br /><br />The chronicle of the Nolans' life was a truly wonderful and enlightening experience. It is so enchanting to travel alongside the family through their trials and celebrations alike. I will admit to several tear streaked pages and advise anyone who reads this book to have a box of tissues handy. I will end with my favorite part of the book. The tree is growing outside the window as Francie looks out at it for the last time. About the tree, Smith writes: \\"It lived! And nothing could destroy it.\\" Those sentences remind me that nothing ever truly dies. Everything and everyone will live on forever in the memory of all who come to love it.<br /><br />- Victoria Testawas a truly wonderful and enlightening experience.

0316098337|5.0|Just finished the audio version of this book and found it as riveting and powerful as so many others. I'm glad the author did not stop with the escape and rescue, as I thought some of the experiences of adjusting to the outside world (for everyone involved) were every bit as fascinating as the world Ma created for herself and her son. But could someone who read the print edition please confirm for me: does the book actually end at the moment Jack is gazing at the prison shed and expressing his astonishment at it? This did not feel right. Thanks.
B00406UK7S|4.0|Interesting drama about a history with very little data, lots of imagination and action, great filming in Northern Scotland.  Worth viewing, but lots of graphic violence, blood and gore.
B003VB5E2E|3.0|Well, Crossroads 2007 still is by far the best of these, IMO.  The Blu-ray here is great though....Wish they would re-package the 2004 and 2007 in Blu-ray.  Some great performances from the same old gang here plus a couple new ones.  Beck looks like a space age freak to me and why is Citizen Cope here?  He looks totally baked is a waste of disk space.  The Clapton set at the end is alright....he looks sort of tired.  I Shot The Sheriff is very good.  I love Doyle Bramhall II but his set was very disappointing.  Worth the price here however due to the blu-ray quality.  Heres to hoping there is a Crossroads 2013!!
B00428ZRFY|5.0|This release is Hot! The album has lived up to all of it's promotion. The cover art is awesome. If this is thought of as a chapter out of the artist's life, What an exciting time it must be for Rihanna. Awesome lyrics, fantastic collaborations with various artists. I love all eleven tracks on this album. And with the deluxe edition you get to see alot of behind the scene work on the DVD. I can't hardly wait to see how this upcoming year is shaped by the music of this wonderful artist. It's time to get LOUD!
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|I really don't even know what to say about this.  I may be one of the few people who went into this completely blind.  I had not heard anything that leaked out from this or any of the other songs that people thought would be on here.  So while there are many who are disappointed over specific songs not being on there, or didn't like the ones that were, since they'd heard them already, I didn't have that.<br /><br />I'm a fan of Kanye's music, if not his persona, and was one of the few that actually liked 808 & Heartbreaks, his previous album of autotuned sorrow dealing with his breakup with a longtime girlfriend and the death of his mother.  I appreciated the raw emotion that he put into it and saw it for what it was.<br /><br />Cathartic expulsion of his inner demons and frustrations.<br /><br />This album though, leaves me struggling for words.  I don't know exactly how to describe it, because I don't think I've heard anything quite like it.  It comes off at times like the senseless drunken rantings of a scorned lover, staggering around his apartment, bottle of jack in his hands, as he's screaming about the woman who left him, even after she's already left him days before.<br /><br />There's chunks of the album that don't even feel like fully put together songs, but rather bits and pieces of experimental messing around in the studio.  With 808's, I realized that while it was a complete 180 from anything he had done before, I could understand and appreciate it.<br /><br />THIS....I just lay there listening to the album after purchasing it repeating the same thing over and over: \\"What am I listening to?\\"<br /><br />Even his trademarked lyrical word play, so much in evidence on College Dropout and Late Registration, are virtually gone, replaced by random non sequiters and a bizarre affinity for a Lil Wayne type inflection to his voice on some areas, specifically \\"Power\\".<br /><br />Oddly enough the one standout for the album, if not exactly a hugely positive one, is Nikki Minaj's schizophrenic unleashed verse on \\"Monster\\".  I'd never listened to her before, had never heard her rap or anything.  I'd read about her, mostly negative, but before this had never heard her voice.  I'm not sure if this makes me want to hear more, but it was definitely different.<br /><br />And I will give Kanye credit for once again stepping out of the mainstream of what is expected and completely doing his own thing.  I give him 3 stars for that alone, but I can't do much more than that.<br /><br />I'm still shocked and not sure what the hell I just experienced.  Perhaps this is one of those albums you listen to multiple times and one day you just GET it.  Who knows?  All I know is right now, after listening to it I truly don't get it.<br /><br />I'm starting to wonder whether I'll wake up in the morning and wish I didn't get it, even at the reduced sale price.<br /><br />UPDATE: 3:21pm PST<br /><br />I know some of his fans will not be happy with this review, and judging from the number of \\"not helpful votes\\" I can see that I'm right with that.  However, I think that simply disliking the album is not indicative of my not being a real fan of his music.  I actually think that I'd rather someone be honest and review the album truthfully, then simply throw up a glowing review that was insincere, simply because it might make people upset otherwise, and they'd give my review a negative rating.<br /><br />This is the first album of his that I genuinely did not love as soon as I heard it.  As I said, maybe one day I'll hear it and feel differently, but as of right now it seems like a mess that was rushed out because of all the leaks.  Apparently there's only four songs on here that haven't been released in some form or another over the past year.  Perhaps that played into the final result.<br /><br />UPDATE #2: 12:26am PST (Wednesday the 24th)<br /><br />Looking back I can see that it appears to some that I only have negative things to say about this album.That's not exactly true, so allow me to clarify.  I'd say the first third (give or take) of the album is actually kinda good, and about on par with what I would expect from Kanye.<br /><br />I love LOVE the orchestra and choir aspects on \\"My Dark Fantasy\\" and \\"Power\\".  Those are the things I love the most about his music, and that is his willingness to go outside the realm of hip hop and really showcase his creativity.  It's one of the few things I admired about Puffy back in the day, and him using samples from classical music and rock and pop.  Anything to switch it up and keep people evolving.<br /><br />Yet for all that creativity, somewhere around track 7 is when things seemed to fall apart.  The creativity he had shown on earlier albums (and in spots in the beginning of this one) went haywhire and it seems like it's just a \\"throw stuff against the wall and see what sticks\\" tactic.<br /><br />As I said, I don't know what to make of the album as a whole.  As a whole it's a mess.  In spots it's brilliant and in other spots it's a trainwreck.  I've loved all his other albums, including 808 & Heartbreak.<br /><br />Hopefully that clarified my views a bit.y kinda good, and about on par with what I would expect from Kanye.

B004132HZS|4.0|Paying $26.00 for three episodes? I mean, come on. The reason only three episodes were shot originally was because the producers weren't sure if the series would have an audience. It gained almost immediate acclaim and raves from critics and viewers alike but that doesn't justify charging a fortune for three episodes. This item should retail for $10.00 - $14.00. Heck, you can buy the whole first season of Wiseguy for $10 and I guarantee you that it has more than 3 episodes.<br /><br />Anyway, the picture quality is excellent and I recommend this series but would encourage you to rent and not buy it.

0743243153|5.0|Simply Spellbinding Work.    A book that perhaps needs to be read every 2-3 years by almost everyone who cares for themselves and others. Hope modern day psychologists and psychiatrists keep this book relevant in their work and assessment of mental health.    It talk of Laziness as the root of most evil - the unwillingness to change or update one's old maps, of not being flexible, anger, fear yada-yada can all be finally traced back to its essence - Laziness. Dr. Scott even rationalizes how the Original Sin can be attributed to Laziness - a desire for shortcuts to knowledge. Basically no pain - no gain.    He talks of the value of self-discipline - as the tool to fight the pervasive law of entropy, some suffering, of love - as a willingness to extend one self for oneself and for others, meaning taking some effort - is true love. Delayed gratification as part of the multifaceted concept of self-discipline.    Approaches the concept of religion very well, its importance and finally that of Grace.  In the end the journey begins and ends with you, self help is the best help - and that can be done by taking the first step and another until death - meaning avoid entropy aka laziness and keep at it - change is the only constant.     Unwilling to accept change and responsibility (due to at the root laziness) is the source of most psychiatric problems - which have various manifestations - psycho and somatic.     In summary this book cannot be para-phrased or summarized - the book is in itself a summary; which you can expand for the rest of your life's journey. Wish You A Happy Reflective Journey to the Center of the Self!

B0026OE2NY|5.0|Nothing short of Brilliant. A must watch for anyone who cares anything about our environment. A stunning portrayal of our Earth we all call home, it shows how close we may now be to a tipping point. In brief, it showcases the incomparable beauty of our Earth and acknowledges its vulerability to environmental change. During this documentary, a disturbing fact is brought to light, that in 50 years, a single lifetime, the Earth has been more radically changed than by all previous generations of humanity. It is more important now than ever before that we shoulder our responibility and show our kids that our home is in an ever increasing need of our attention.  We need to be the generation that highlights the mistakes of our past and gives our children as much information and as many tools as we can, so their generation and that of their children will be equipped to take on the future challenges of the environment.  I beleive this film does address many of the issues that we are currently facing and the more understanding of our environmental situation, the more likely the success of our engagement in its recovery. We need to elevate our kids cognisance of their global, borderless environment. To have them become aware that we can all play an important roll in our Earths future. That collectively we can accomplish great achievements but that one person can also make a significant difference. It is only through our own awareness that we may inspire our youth to become proactive custodians of our planet we call home. Find the time to check it out, [...]    John, N. Vancouver, BC

B0038M2AZA|4.0|Claire Danes was a much-heralded actress when she made her major film debut alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in 1996.   Then for a while she seemed to fade into the woodwork.  \\"Temple Grandin\\" is a strong and welcome reaffirmation of Danes' abilities as an actress.    As evidenced by the many reviews here, this is a disarming, straightforward little film about an individual's triumph over disability.  Of course, the message the movie carries is not so much about a misunderstood \\"disability\\" as it is about the simple condition of being \\"different\\".  Midway through the movie we see a large, prominent photograph of Albert Einstein in Temple Grandin's living quarters.  Point taken.  Einstein suffered from epilepsy; he was different.  If you can't appreciate difference, how can you recognize genius?    Temple Grandin has autism, but she is gifted with the ability to instinctively think like an engineer.  She finds a solution to help quiet her problems of anxiety when she visits a cattle farm as a teenager.  Having empathy for the animals, but no understanding of human mannerisms, she elects to pursue a career in animal science.      Much of the movie concerns her struggles to overcome the shortsighted, virulent chauvinism of western cattlemen that she seeks to work with in Arizona.  But, showing an incredible mix of resolve, pluck, and ingenuity, she manages to prevail.    Claire Danes, playing Grandin, keeps a preternaturally alert expression on her face, betraying both fear and curiosity.  Danes also appears to have lost considerable weight to take on the role of a person who subsists on a diet of yogurt, pudding, and jello.   Julia Ormond is luminously beautiful as Grandin's loving and sympathetic mother;  David Strathairn is also effective as a teacher who spots Grandin's intellectual potential.    This movie is a clear winner on all counts, with one minor detraction for me.  The musical score is a stale, numbing take on Philip Glass' minimalism.  Though it may have beenintended to convey a sense of Grandin's inner struggles and determination, I found it instead to be merely irritating.  A minor complaint, but it did affect my appreciation of an otherwise stellar film.
0670033375|5.0|This book has helped me realize how all cultures including ours rise and fall, and how they pretty much do it the same way, over and over. In most cases the failure could have been avoided, but the rich and powerful usually avoid dealing with the failing society in favor of trying to hold on to their personal wealth and power at the expense of the starving masses.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|While keeping the plot discreet, I must start off by saying that this one of the best installments of the series to have come out since the first movie. I have been fortunate in being able to see all the Harry Potter installments, including this one. However, I must say that from my perspective, that the movie is so intense, that anyone that is 12 or under may need a person to accompany them that is at least 18 or over. I say this only because I feel that this movie is terrific, but it is much more intense than the other installments. This movie finds Harry Potter and his friends coming to terms with learning who is truthfully on their side and the people that he knew that went to the dark side. There is strong romantic chemistry between both Hermoine and Harry and Hermoine and Ron that you end up wondering how the future between the three of them is going to unfold. From the beginning the movie carefully paints a picture that one cannot overcome the trials of life alone. Once again in this movie, the viewer gets to see many of the people that are going to be a part in helping Harry and his friends along their journey. This series has alot of good special effects and scenery that both adults and children are going to love. The plot, all the way up to the ending is very well developed that time really flies when you see the movie. Many of the events in the movie are very exciting and leave you in suspense. Last, but not least, I enjoyed the Harry Potter movie that was released last summer. However, I would have to say that this movie (the Deathly Hallows one) is definitely better than last years, and many like myself are going to feel that it is even better than the first (which is saying alot, because the first installment is a classic).
0446195529|5.0|It is a shame that so many people write one star reviews because of the Kindle price without saying anything about the book itself. It is especially shameful when it is about a book that is simply a great read. Baldacci has always given great stories, thrilling books that entertain and at the same time inform.     Hell's Corner is like reading three thrillers in one. His Camel Club stories are tremendous, and this is by far the best yet with strong characters, great plotting and smooth writing that transitions effortlessly. For those who remember his first thriller, \\"Absolute Power\\" and recall how great that was more than a dozen years ago, Hell's Corner is equal if not a bit better, mostly because of several intertwined plots that wind endlessly until the reader might think it can never come together in a logical conclusion. It does, and the end is a most satisfying ride.    I seldom rate books five stars with such enthusiasm, but I really think that Hell's Corner won't disappoint even the most persnickety reader's requirements. If you read only one thriller this fall it has to be Baldacci's Hell's Corner. Ignore the one star complaints - they are justified but there should be other ways of registering their disappointments. I own and use a Kindle often, but for my favorite authors I prefer to have them on one of my bookshelves, and Hell's Corner deserves to be there.
B0014BECF8|5.0|I must start of this review by admitting that I grew up with his music. I was only 7 when I first heard some of his songs such as \\"Faith\\", \\"Father Figure\\" and the very sexually suggestive but good \\"I Want Your Sex\\". Yes, I understand that 7 is maybe way too young to be listening to such songs, but they were playing often on the radio were I grew up, and the songs were very catchy and drew one's attention to listen to. What helped reignite my interest to eventually get his cd was when I heard his song \\"Fast Love\\" at a male strip club that I had honestly went to when I visited Darwin, Australia. When I was living in Japan, his newer music was also getting played there (such as the \\"Freek\\" song). Many of his songs are very original and classic, so it is only natural that they would be enjoyed over two decades  later by many people. What I like about this collection is it does have a very wide range of songs depending on your mood. For instance if you want to be cheered up you can listen to his classics such as \\"Faith\\", \\"Freedom\\", and \\"Flawless\\". If you are in an erotic mood the songs to listen to are \\"Too Funky\\", \\"Fast Love\\", and \\"FreeeK\\". Of course, there are many other enjoyable songs on this eclectic collection. I was just honestly listing some of my favorites. This is a good collection to start with if you own only a few of George Michael's albums (three or less) or if it is your first time. I do enjoy this collection, but I wish that the track \\"I Want Your Sex\\" would have been included on it. I only say this because he does pour much passion and strong energy into many of his songs, which is a positive thing.  There is something about some of the sexual songs that he sings that really showcase his talent. Please understand that I do feel that he is also good in his other type of songs such as in \\"Father Figure\\", \\"Faith\\", and \\"Feeling Good\\". However, there is something about him singing his erotic songs where his talent and passion come out the most (such as in \\"Freeek\\" and \\"Fast Love\\"). My husband thinks that this has something to do with George Michael being a sexual being, and I have to admit that I agree with his statement. Also, my husband was listening to many of the songs when I was playing it, and he enjoys many of the songs on the collection as well.eeek\\" and \\"Fast Love\\").

B004BSIJ9Q|4.0|$4 is what mp3 albums should sell for! If more albums were priced like this, people would steal a lot less and buy a lot more. Go Kanye... not his best album, but definitely worth the price!
B003L77TZI|5.0|This cd is great to purchase and enjoy if you love fun pop and/or dance music that reminds you of partytime fun. Truthfully, I was not planning to get the cd at first. This was only because I had heard \\"California Girls\\", and I thought that it was a decent song, but not one that would make me want to rush out and get the cd. Then Mtv played \\"Teenage Dream\\" and listening to the fun and sensual lyrics made me rethink my decision to purchase the cd. It was something about her music video and the lyrics and song of \\"Teenage Dream\\" that made me want to purchase her whole album and see what it is like. I am so glad that I gave her cd a chance because I do enjoy \\"Teenage Dream\\" but there are other songs on her cd that are just as good. A couple of my favorites that I think deserve more exposure and even radio airplay are \\"Hummingbird Heartbeat\\" and \\"Peacock\\". Yes, \\"Peacock\\" is a very sexually suggestive song, but it is a good song that would be good to play at a party or club. This cd grows on you more and more each time that you play it too. For instance, when I first started playing the cd \\"Teenage Dream\\" and \\"Peacock\\" were my two favorite songs. The more I play it, the more I enjoy the other songs too such as \\"Firework\\" and \\"Last Friday Night\\". The best way to tell if you are going to enjoy the cd is to ask yourself if you are comfortable playing good songs with sexual innuendos. I know this may seem obvious, but some people do not enjoy hearing songs with sexual overtones. As for me, I am fine with this because I am a sensual person who appreciates even the various types of music that some may find extremely suggestive. My husband recently showed one of her recent concert videos from youtube on the \\"peacock\\" song. She seemed to be really having fun with the song, and so did her audience (the video footage is from one of her concerts in Australia). Both my husband and I like the \\"Peacock\\" song, but all the songs on the cd are fun to listen to. This is a good cd worth buying if your taste in music is towards fun pop music that you can play at a party and/or having fun. This is also a good cd to listen to with your significant other (whether you are married, in a domestic partnership, or single). In my humble opinion, this is one of the best albums to own for this fall season.ying if your taste in music is towards fun pop music that you can play at a party and/or having fun.

B00418NVMQ|5.0|WOW! A cd AND a dvd? And both ROCK! I missed Halestorm when they came to Tulsa (family must come first), and have been bummed about it ever since. Thank you, Halestorm, for a dvd so I could have a live Halestorm experience! Both the cd and dvd are are good recording quality and wonderfully edited. Lzzy and and Arejay give 'em HALE, while Joe rocks it out and Josh lays down the bottom line. I was surprised they gave \\"equal time\\" to the bass (not usually done on a live dvd-ROCK ON, FELLOW BASSPLAYERS!!!). Getting to see Lzzy front the band and hearing her perform vocally was a real treat. And getting to see Arejay (and eventually the rest of the band joining in)BOOM it up on \\"Boom City\\" was excellent!!! LOVED IT when Joe (on ACOUSTIC GUITAR) and Lzzy performed my favorite Halestorm song \\"I'm Not An Angel\\". I bought the first Halestorm cd (what seems like) a long time ago, and gave it a rating of \\"OMG-YOU MUST HEAR THIS!\\", and this live performance is right there, too. Halestorm rocks you hard, takes you down with A Familiar Taste Of Poison, and then rocks you up and leaves you wanting more. This is more than a concert - THIS IS A PERFORMANCE. You watch and/or listen and you'll know what I mean. Can't wait to see what they do next!!!
B004CAWKXE|5.0|This cd is a wonderful follow up to Black Parade.  My Chemical Romance loads their creativity to the gun and shoot you in the head.  It's a wonderful explosion of talent that differs from past albums but still feels distinctly MCR.<br /><br />They have tons of fast, energetic songs which keep your ears addicted and lyrics to get drunk on.  If you enjoy MCR or quality music of this genre I highly recommend getting this album (not that my opinion matters).
144471032X|3.0|It's just ok.  One of my co-workers has lost 45 lbs following this diet/eating plan.  However, I'm not sure I can follow it.  The plan seems a bit extreme to me.  I highly recommend that anyone who gets this book read it cover to cover and discuss it with their doctor before making a final decision.
B0015DROBO|2.0|My God, I'm at 72% (kindle page speak) of this snoozer, and I'm still waiting for all the suspense, drama, and sheer awesomeness all you other reviews keep talking about. This book (so far) is boring as hell, except for the explict detail used for the sexual crimes (and revenge, yeah!). I mean, come on, does every little detail have to be explained to shear exhaustion?? Supposedly, this a mystery...the only mystery to me is how did this book get so popular? Jeez, I can't take it anymore. But I always finish a book I start, so I'll just keep on going.  Even if it get more interesting, this is waaay to far in the story for it to pick up, and to me not worth it.  I'm definitely not BUYING the rest of the books in this series, I'm mad I paid for this one! hmphf!
B000063DIR|5.0|Diary of a madman and blizzard of ozz are both five star albums and the guitar playing is amazing and melodic rhoads  was amazing he played classical guitar and turned it into heavy metal thats amazing his guitar playing is beautiful

B000002H33|5.0|This is one of thee best heavy metal albums of all time.  The riffs by james hetfield and the killer solos by kirk hammett are mind blowing. i love the whole album all the way through but i have to say master of puppets is my favorite song on the album.  Master of puppets,rust in peace,and reign in blood are among my favorite metal albums of all time.
B0035G9ABG|5.0|Excellent CD/DVD SET..  Packaged VERY WELL...  Thanks Alot!! Now I have   everything from them to date..
B00005K9QP|5.0|This is my favorite album by clapton because he tears up the blues with a gibson les paul eric clapton was ahead of his time steppin out is a amazing piece of music but the whole album is amazing dont pass this album up this is for people that love the blues period
B0044IJ1S6|2.0|The audio on this blu-ray is not that great and was a disappointment. The stereo track sounds a bit hollow and recessed on a good stereo system. If you are buying this for the audio I would pass on it. For comparison, the Madonna Stick and Sweet blu-ray has excellent 5 star audio (and video also).
B000002G8H|5.0|This album is great eric clapton is great and hes one of the reason i started playing guitar hes a great influence to me i love this whole album and wonderful tonight is such a beautiful song the string bending is beautiful ec is a genius for making up that song for his wife at the time patti boyd eric clapton is one of my top 3 guitarist of all time
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|Clapton is the latest offering by legendary rock icon, Eric Clapton and a must-have for fans and music enthusiasts alike. Like many classics in the making, this project digs it's hooks deeper into the minds of its listeners each time it's played. While writing this review, I originally wrote \\"rock enthusiasts\\" but changed it to \\"music enthusiasts\\". The reason being is that the CD covers a wide array of genre's that don't really fall into any sort of rock category.<br /><br />The vibe that I get from the album is that I'm sitting in Clapton's living room, being afforded the treat of listening to him jam on a wide range of tunes with friends like J.J. Cale, Derek Trucks, drumming phenomenon, Jim Keltner, Sheryl Crow, Steve Winwood and several others.  From the opening tune, Travelin' Alone, to my personal favorite, River Runs Deep, to Autumn Leaves, you will feel that you're sitting on the outer perimeter of this historic jam session, listening to new, as well as cover, tunes.  You half expects to hear some laughing and cutting up after a song is finished.<br /><br />What I would pay to be a fly on that wall!<br /><br />Clapton's voice is as smooth and strong as ever.  His playing is, well, I mean, c'mon!  We're talking Clapton here!  It's great!  Each note played is fluid and bang on.  Because Eric is playing songs HE wants with no plan or agenda in mind, you get a sense that he's playing from the inner-most being of his heart, creating a love and sincere interpretation to his playing. When a well established artist is able to maintain their love and passion for their music, they (as well as their listeners) are blessed by the experience.<br /><br />This disc is definitely one for your library and will make an excellent gift for the avid music enthusiasts in your life.<br /><br />Randy Patterson<br />Boomerocity.com

0711974594|1.0|For anyone with more than 6 months playing, this book is a ripoff.  Way to simplistic and NOT at all true to how the songs were actuallty played.  Forget this one.
B001VNB54A|5.0|I'm a huge fan of war movies. I've probably watched Saving Private Ryan and Black Hawk Down over 50 times, to name a few... That goes the same for Band of Brothers, but man this series blew me away.. Really tragic but amazing film production. It might take me a while to replay this film because I'm still \\"recovering\\" from (or getting over) certain parts of the series, if not the whole series. Spielberg and Hanks do a Real good job making you feel like you're a witness to this terrible moment in history.  Overall, I now have an even greater height of respect for the soldiers who served in the Pacific theatre thanks to this Mini-Series.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love zombie stories, but it can be hard to find stories that are something other than \\"group of strangers trapped in (fill in the blank location) surrounded by brain eating zombies.\\"  This book does a really good job of looking at the \\"what if\\" scenario of an actual zombie outbreak and how society would respond.  This doesn't present the Hollywood notion of the end of the world, but really looks at the social, legal, and economic implications and addresses them with wit and humor.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|It's hard to believe we've now been living with Harry Potter for going on 12 years for Americans, and 13 years if you're British since the first book was published in the UK as \\"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\\" in 1997 and \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" in the US in 1998. In the first installment of the last book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I, the entire Harry Potter enterprise has literally come-of-age. The story and characters have matured along with the writer, her readers/film-goers, as well as the actors in the primary roles. Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and Daniel Radcliffe in the roles of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, and Harry Potter have grown up along with their youthful wizards, and the actors themselves are fast-earning the right to be regarded as A-list talent. Hopefully, they will have fine careers ahead of them, assuming they won't be forever type-cast as the Hogwarts wizard students of the Harry Potter novels. And of course, the ultimate credit of the series belongs to J.K. Rowling who has created a universe as recognizable as JRR Tolkien's Middle Earth, Stephen King's Dark Tower, and Anne Rice's 18th and 19th-century vampire societies.<br /><br />The rest of the cast of \\"HP and the Deathly Hallows\\", aside from the young leads, comprises bona fide A-list actors who were already demonstrating the heights of their craft long before J.K. Rowling was penning Harry Potter in tea shops as a single mother on welfare in Britain. Ironically, the names topping the list play the villains and dark characters: Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, and Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. Special recognition has to be paid to Fiennes as Voldemort whose demonic persona makes the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein's monster appear more like bank robbers by comparison. Fiennes, despite the warped face and absent nose, is entirely believable as the sworn enemy of Harry Potter and an adversary to all that is good in the Wizard World.<br /><br />However the crux of the tale (as with the rest of the series), surrounds the three young leads inside an incredible production. The first couple of installments were written more for a younger age group. Now the characters and their respective actors have grown in complexity and subtlety. They reside inside the skins of their characters in ways which make you believe they understand and appreciate them more. No longer the smart class show-off of younger years, Hermione has grown into a young woman beginning to appreciate more fully the powers she has been taught which can transform the world rather than simply being the most-liked by her teachers. Weasley has a better sense of himself and is now dating Hermione which would have been unthinkable in the first few Harry Potter stories. And Harry Potter is nearing the moment when he can face Lord Vortemort as a near-equal without cringing at the sound of the name.<br /><br />The plot of the present installment is the most complex and compelling yet. Voldemort has gained power over the Ministry of Magic who are running the wizard government akin to Nazism of the 1930's. Anyone with \\"muggle\\" (i.e. non-wizard) blood risks being expelled and/or subdued by high-ranking officials in kangaroo courts. They have even placed a roman-inspired relief in the wizard town square showing muggles being subdued by magic. Although the wizard ministry and government are run by mortal wizards, Lord Voldemort is pulling the puppet strings like a demonic equivalent of the Godfather. He is on the verge of gaining complete immortality through the Horcrux's, amulet artifacts which also have an interesting side-affect of making the wearer become more self-absorbed and selfish, not unlike the Ring of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Dumbledore had begun the mission of destroying the Horcrux's as a means of defeating Voldemort; the mission now is passed onto Harry Potter and his friends. Harry Potter along with allies escort him to a refuge but are immediately besieged by the soulless dementors. There must have been a traitor among them which tipped off Voldemort.<br /><br />The three young wizards then engage in a two-fold quest: to obtain and destroy the Horcrux's to stop Voldemort from permanently gaining immortality thereby becoming the absolute-ruler of the Wizard World for eternity. Think of Adolph Hitler wielding a wand. Unfortunately, the Horcrux's appear indestructible, and they must obtain an artifact willed to Potter from the late Dumbledore, a sword, Godric Gryffindor, which Hermione realizes may contain enough power to destroy the Horcrux. During their quest, they keep stumbling upon a strange triangular symbol, which even appears on one of the stones of a cemetery at Harry Potter's birthplace which is also his parents' deathplace.<br /><br />A brilliant and compelling film all the way around despite having been absent from Hogwarts, with absolutely phenomenal effects which neither impedes the story nor hinders the acting but enhances the Wizard World and the story contained within. The acting is some of the best I have seen for a fantasy film/story, it's only rival Peter Jackson's \\"Lord of the Rings\\". The best which can said of this film is that it never appears like the filmmakers were relying solely on the Harry Potter name for success.

1577314808|5.0|The book has very powerful teachings. Eckhart Tolle is an enlightened soul bring in light in the darkness of our mind. If we live in the present, and don't dwell in the past or don't run after the future, we live our life full of joy, beauty, creativity and love. The present, as he says, cannot have any problem as the present is only action: we have to accept it, ignore it or solve it. The way he explains how we can make our relationships full of love and compassion, how we can dissolve our pain-body and transcend our base emotions to the noble ones, is remarkable, with brevity of words and flowing logic. I recommend everyone to read this book!
B003A4IFDW|3.0|Bettye LaVette has been around forever and a day without deserved acclaim until now!  Back in the sixties noticed this great voice but Bettye only played on R&B stations caught this soul music lovers attention and have a number of old stunning 45 rpm's that are classic. Early eighties a great Motown Lp \\"Tell Me A Lie\\" (\\"Right In The Middle Of Falling In Love\\" should have been a smash!) was released and felt certain her time had come...no promotion & minimal airplay resulted in Bettye once again snubbed by the music industry and took years for Bettye to have chance come her way again so unfortunate \\"Interpertations\\" isn't perfection as it should have been.<br />Early nineties stellar release \\"Atlantic Sisters Of Soul\\" featured incredible Bettye LaVette riveting stand-out performance \\"Your Turn To Cry\\" from tremendous unreleased Atlantic Records Lp and believe this started the buzz leading to current success. Surrounded by terrific singers like Mary Wells, Esther Phillips, Dee Dee Warwick and other legendary soulful Divas, Bettye's soul-stirring anthem stands out big-time and what a memorable & hypnotic performance it is! Live sets and great releases lead to current collection which is a mixed bag that I really wanted to love but should have come out better and exceeded expectations but sounds like somebody got way too serious...up-tempo numbers and riveting power ballads with strong rhythm tracking are best suited to Bettye's rough & raw voice yet \\"Interpretations: The British Rock Songbook\\" has a number of slow songs with no rhythm track to carry vocals and these don't work and end up sounding the same...contrast this with riveting Hollywood Bowl \\"Beatle Tribute Concert\\" performance, Bettye took the evening by storm giving a show-stopping performance with a fine full orchestra receiving a well deserved standing ovation from an enraptured crowd...Bettye was stunning and on fire!<br />\\"Interpretations\\" does have its moments of greatness always found in a LeVette set and hot funky opener \\"The Word\\" is a promising start as Bettye makes this one her own while an amazing \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" is another definitive performance that is wildy hot & riveting...\\"No Time To Live\\" is richly engrossing but by now sadly it becomes apparent too many slow lumbering songs with Bettye sounding in too much pain drag things down showing Bettye LaVette is best with strong rhythm tracks and terrific when she funks it up and has some fun! Compare the riveting & passionate Joe Cocker \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" from \\"Heart and Soul\\" or the rocking Petula Clark version from \\"Warm And Tender\\" to this bogged-down version and these fiery definitive versions work and are inspired...both legends take Paul McCartney classic to the max and are essential & highly recommended for any music lover who love definitive performances. Remix would be awesome of all lumbering slow songs in this collection to have fired up rhythmic arrangements and \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" with a Joe Cocker like arrangement featuring Ms. LaVette would be a winner. Bettye is a tremendous legendary singer deserving a legendary equal like Gamble/Huff Dexter Wansel or Jimmy Jam/Terry Lewis at the helm arranging & producing and results would be extraordinary.  Closing \\"Interpretations\\" with beautifully orchestrated searing live performance \\"Love Reign O'er Me\\" show a live collection would be great for the next Bettye LaVette project but this time give Bettye the support she needs with a brilliantly arranged orchestra complete with a hot cooking rhythm section and inspired background singers...spice it up and have fun! Sometimes an artist can get too serious and results become stiff...sadly looks like that is what happened this time...loosen up & let it flow then next time could be that classic we are waiting for!
B003JXUXPW|5.0|I first heard Gregory sing when his sister Lawanda Smith, a performing artist in my city, posted a Facebook link to his new video, recently released, called Illusion.    I'm a longtime musician, writer, singer, and theatrical producer, so I'm a little hard-bitten and tough to please...but HOLY COW! This guy delivers the goods in a feel-every-moment, make-every-word-count, and leave-'em-wanting-more sort of way that you almost never encounter on the air any more.     His lyrics are as well-crafted, and as smart, as the best of the \\"golden age\\" songwriters, and he just hangs them in the air for your ears to fall in love with, stretching out the ends of notes and phrases in that lazy, rich and bottomless way that made guys like Nat King Cole justly famous.    Follow Gregory Porter. He's going to be one of the greats. His music will help you feel and breathe again; and this album is worth your money.

0061703257|5.0|I LOVE this book! It has been a while since I've read a book that has held my attention but it was great & I HIGHLY advise reading this if you're into books with plot twists or enjoy a read that keeps you wanting to turn the page for more!
B004B4J7H8|3.0|There are only a few tracks that stand out in this entire album. Of those tracks, none of them compare to the best ones from the previous films. There really isn't much of a theme. I noticed when I watched the film that I hardly noticed any of the music, even though I had already listened to it beforehand.<br /><br />It's not BAD, but it's not great like I've come to expect. The Twilight movies that Desplat did have better theme tracks. I'm sad.
B002U9JEVA|5.0|While Norah Jones is known for her piano performances, she takes up he guitar for this album.  It makes for a different sound but I still love it.
B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Read the rollingstone review of MBDTF.  Could not be put any better.     Any album worth hearing is leaked one way or another.  I appreciate the fact that Kanye put it out himself.  People want the entire album and I am sure this will be reflected in total sales.  This thing from start to finish kills.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|Ok.. this album did not sweep my off my feet the first listen.. Normally anything Josh sings instantly  has that effect upon the first listen.  One should not have to continually listen to an album over and over to see if they like it. With this one.. i may just have to do that.. I was expecting more from him and this album.
B002WOZKY8|2.0|I expected more talent after all the awards.  Instead all I found was a cute kid singing unoriginal material with catchy production and no soul.  His music suffers greatly when taken out of the context of his videos because his good looks aren't there to distract from its mediocrity.
B00428ZRFE|5.0|lOVE THE ALBUM.. FUN, YOUNG, EACH SONG CARRIES A DIFFERENT MESSAGE.. YOU CAN RELATE TO IT ON EVERY LEVEL.. I LIKE THE APPROACH THAT THE SINGLES REACH DIFFERENT GENRES OF MUSIC.  FROM HOUSE, POP, R&B ISLAND DRIVEN TO EVEN A LIL COUNTRY ON \\" CALIFORNIA KING BED\\"  I CAN SEE THIS RECORD RELEASING MANY SINGLES!! GREAT JOB!!
B003X2O6KW|5.0|A solid portion of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy earned its premiere on YouTube in the form of a half-hour music video for the single \\"Runaway.\\" Opening the album with the same song as the video, titling it \\"Dark Fantasy,\\" Kanye gives the first words to a female narrator, a fallen phoenix. With a choir of oohs and aahs in the background, she says \\"you might think you've peeped the scene. You haven't, the real one's far too mean. The watered down one, the one you know, was made up centuries ago. It made it sound all whack and corny. Yes, it's awful, blasted boring. Twisted fiction, sick addiction, well gather round children, zip it listen!\\" A grand piano chord quickly follows this short narrative and so begins Kanye's latest epic production.<br /><br />Kanye is no stranger to grandiose compositions. Even his debut album, The College Dropout, had nearly an hour and twenty minutes of music with standout tracks like \\"Jesus Walks\\" paving the way for a new generation of artists. However, never before has Kanye blended so many genres of music together or taken so many musical chances on one record. Even a simple glimpse at the guest list is enough to make the heads of fans spin. Elton John, Chris Rock, Rihanna, Fergie, John Legend, Kid Cudi, Rick Ross and Jay-Z all on the same album? Bon Iver on a hip hop record? If there was ever any question as to how this could all work, a single listen to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy is all the proof you'll need.<br /><br />Although the entire album has an unquestionable flow that keeps every song fresh and intriguing, there are two tracks on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy that truly capture what Kanye West has built his career up to. The first is \\"All of the Lights.\\" Complete with its own cello and piano interlude, \\"All of the Lights\\" throws an entire brass section into the mix and allows Rihanna as many if not more of the featured vocals in the song. Although strings and brass have all been used within the realm of hip hop before, the stylistic blend between classical, fanfare, and club worthy beats in less than a minute feels natural and effortless on \\"All of the Lights.\\" The second feature track is, appropriately, the lead single \\"Runaway.\\" Opening with a minimalist piano part similar to the end of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Closer,\\" Kanye takes the listener on a six minute journey with some astute lyrics of self-reflection. As the beat abruptly ends and leaves the piano on its own once again, one may think the track has finished, but an additional 3 minutes of deep staccato strings behind a vocoder solo offer proof of Kanye's desire to push the boundaries of acceptable singles in today's pop culture.<br /><br />Kanye West is not perfect. You know it, he knows it, and we all know the media exploits his imperfections to no end. Sure, he made a fool of himself on stage when he stole the spotlight from Taylor Swift at the VMAs. Yep, he sent a racy photo of himself to a woman that ended up on the internet. OK, his last album, 808s & Heartbreak, put a few nails in Auto-Tune's coffin, but like him or not, he's a visionary and a musical mastermind. With three phenomenal albums, The College Dropout, Late Registration, and Graduation, already under his belt, Kanye West enters his second decade of musical production with his best solo release yet. My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy has once again upped the standards of rap that he himself set.<br /><br />Similar Artists: Jay-Z, Dr. Dre<br />Track Suggestion: \\"All of the Lights\\"ylistic blend between classical, fanfare, and club worthy beats in less than a minute feels natural and effortless on \\"All of the Lights.\\" The second feature track is, appropriately, the lead single \\"Runaway.\\" Opening with a minimalist piano part similar to the end of Nine Inch Nails' \\"Closer,\\" Kanye takes the listener on a six minute journey with some astute lyrics of self-reflection.

B0009VRHLK|1.0|This is the most boring and slow-moving film I have ever watched. It was an impulse buy and I regretted not reading all the reviews on amazon before buying. The only thing that could redeem this film would be the soundtrack. I would totally sell this DVD away or give it to someone who wants to watch chloe sevigny performing fellatio.
1441965904|4.0|Although this book seems to be intended for academics, I found it extremely useful myself as a software developer. I frequently have to go to clients and do demos in English, not a task that I particularly enjoy even though my English is of a Cambridge Proficiency level. This book has helped me overcome my fears and to understand that communication is two-way - if I don't understand my client's questions during the demo, I am not afraid to ask them to speak more slowly.    I also found the advice about keeping graphs, tables and figures as simple as possible. Before reading this book, I found that my clients often stared at my slides without really understanding them - both because of the very complex graphs and because I filled them with too much text.    This is a great book and is written in a very essential style that is easy to follow and consult.
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|I am sorry, but this is wack... from top to bottom! I wanna see the sales figures of this i am gonna be shocked if it goes gold
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am in the military and need to stay physically fit.  I am also a mommy of 2 (ages 3 and 1) and work full time and go to school.  needless to say, i have very little me time to work out at a gym.  I purchased this DVD bc i figured i could find 20 mins a day to do a workout to help me maintain my fitness.      I only started this a week ago and can already tell a difference.  I was sore the entire first week from different muscles i thought were in shape.  I did the week 1 routine for about 3 days.  I thought it was too easy and moved up to the week 2 routine.  it is def a bit tougher and she keeps you moving so i dont get bored or can slack off.  she also talks through the DVD but gives pointers on the proper form and encouragement.  I dont think that it is too much.  i like it so that it keeps me focused.    I am still sore from this DVD but i am determined to keep it up for 30 days.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|I swear Harry has no power in this film, the most powerful thing in the movie are the elves who save everyone two or three times. Harry is nothing more then hype in this movie and is dragged around being saved by the whole good guy gang thru this whole Lobsterfest. Please give Harry some kind of power how can he be a hero of any sort when he can't wipe his own bum. How this painful excuse for a Harry Potter film gets a A- rating is beyond me. This movie should have been one hour long, but oh no we have to pad this snoozefest out to make two long and very boring sleep aids (maybe part two will have more action). This film would make my list of biggest disappointments for 2010, so if you have not seen this film I would wait for a cheap rental.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Don't expect an extremely detailed review, because, even I, an extremely dedicated member of the MCRmy, cannot even begin to find words that describe this album, and I know a majority of the MCRmy feels the same. This album is absolutely incredible. Danger Days is, to me, an alternate universe, or an alternate reality, if you like. This album is filled to the brink with kick ass tunes and songs that you just won't be able to stop yourself jumping around to. Not only that, but there are also quite a few ballads on here, something that's completely different to MCR's previous three albums. Actually, scrap that. Let's be honest. EVERYTHING. IS. DIFFERENT... and it's the most amazing thing they've ever done. This time around, they seem 110% ecstatic with what they're produced, and, for the first time in a long time, they're actually having a blast doing it. The amount of creativity and imagination surrounding this album is astounding, and the Killjoy world is just so... visually stunning. Trust me, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STOP LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM. All I can say right now is BUY, BUY, BUY. Killjoys, make some noise!    Jade - xo
B000J0OANO|5.0|This game is one of my big favorites.  I played this growing up many times with my family.  It is a must have.  But why is it $127?  I want the game but not that bad.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|Don't be misled by the list of familiar song titles that accompany these rare specialty items from the brothers Gibb. Similar to a custom mix that a fan might make on their own, a separate CD for each of the four brothers, where that brother sings the lead to a long list of songs, this high quality collection is a book as much as it is a set of four CDs. Especially noteworthy is the superb sound quality of the individual tracks, many of them rare and not included in the original studio albums. Also special is the fact that for the first time ever, the two deceased brothers, Maurice and Andy, each have their own CD mixes lumping their best work together on their own CD. Deceptively pricey and incorrectly described by some as suitable only for hardcore fans of the group, I could easily recommend this compilation to anyone looking for a definitive collection of the group's songs. This is the one to buy. The text and many photos are the ideal complement to the music, and this is the kind of collected work that can be played and enjoyed over and over again without getting old or tiresome. Whether a casual fan or Saturday-Night-Fever fanatic, do yourself a favor and add it to your music library.
B002Q7JYPC|2.0|After a long road to get here, only 6 songs that even made it to my I-tunes library. Only two that I really like alot! Don't waste your money!!! I have all their albums previously released and this doesn't compare!!
B002ZCY7QY|5.0|I have to say that at first glance, the third season of Chuck seemed to be the weakest of the series. But, watching all the 19 episodes again, it maked me change my mind. I still think that the second season is the best of all, but there are some awesome episodes in the third season, and it has an unbelieveable season finale. It worth to watch again, and I'm so enjoying the fourth season, which I think it could be as good as the second season (as I said, the best of all for me), or maybe, the best season of all. LONG LIVE TO CHUCK!
B003X2O6KW|5.0|I just bought this album and I'm glad to say I'm not dissapointed. The sound is so new, in fact some of the songs actually invoked a laugh from me. This is an absolute joy to listen to you. Kanye is pushing the envelope, he goes to another level with this. Instant classic
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I can barley write about how great this album is ... many people will say it is a change.. and yes it is... but when the change that has been brought about is good fun and works then who cares?    A fantastic album and is good for all fans, old and new.
0312370849|5.0|Our book club selected Sarah's Key to read for the month of October.  I could not put the book down once I stared reading.  All the ladies liked the book very much.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Honestly, when I first heard that My Chemical Romance scrapped a whole album to write a new one, I was kind of concerned. I wondered why they did and what their purpose was. But then I took a step back and listened to all of their previous albums again and I realized that these guys know what they are doing. I had faith in the band I had listened to for years.    Four years after \\"The Black Parade\\", we get \\"Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys\\".  This album is by far their best yet. It is creative, catchy and fun, but still holds true to everything they have ever stood for. They still have that amazing sound they were always known for, with a new electronic twist.    The album begins with a call to arms by our post apocalyptic DJ, Dr. Death Defying that leads right into the first single off the album \\"Na Na Na\\". It's loud, its catchy, and will be stuck in your head for the rest of the day. It's a powerful song to open with. From then on, you are taken on a ride. You feel like you are in the Trans Am with the boys, rocking out and running from BL/ind, the evil corporation that the Killjoys are trying to defeat.  Dr. Death Defying comes back two more times in the album, one to tell us about Jet Star and Kobra Kid, and again to sign off. But after ends his transmission, there is still one last song. A punk song called \\"Vampire Money\\" with a beginning that reminds you of \\"Ballroom Blitz\\". This seems as the most perfect way to end the album, with a fun song that shows that My Chemical Romance is back and here to stay.    People may argue that they have changed or \\"sold out\\" but I don't think that at all. The boys have grown up. They are all married and some of them now even have children of their own. They are still the same band we all know and love, just doing what they want.    This album is amazing and I recommend it to anyone who loves fun, good music, that has lyrical substance.    If I could, I'd give it 1000 out of 10 stars.  But I guess a 5 out of 5 will have to do :)
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki delivers so much that I cannot breathe. I love this album as  I have been listening to it on her facebook page and since It came to my house today. I love everything about it including \\"Roman's Revenge\\" and \\"I'm The Best\\". She truly stands alone on this album and I loooove it.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|My Chemical Romance have been gone for nearly two years. It's been 4 years since they're last album, and Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is a huge change from previous albums such as The Black Parade and Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge. The band's previous three albums were dark and edgy. Danger Days is bright, colorful, and in-your-face-obnoxious. However, it doesn't lose the charm that is My Chemical Romance.     The album, while not exactly a concept album, fits into a world of California in 2019. It's after the apocalypse, and everything is controlled by the bland Better Living Industries. The Killjoys are there to bring art back into the world with color and ray guns. It's hard to keep MCR from telling a story, now isn't it?    As for the songs, they aren't what you would expect. They do not sound like the band's previous three albums. However, that's a good sign. Had the band written copy-cat songs, they wouldn't have grown. They would be stuck on what made them popular rather than taking a risk in order to make something they enjoyed.     Each song exists in its own little world. From the obnoxious \\"Na Na Na\\" to the more mellow \\"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\\" each song is different. Gerard Way's voice does not fail to entertain, and his lyrics are sharp and biting, even in the slowest song on the record. Even the last song, \\"Vampire Money\\" takes a stab at the vampire culture that has dominated today's world. The music itself is clean, tight, and exciting, with intense guitar solos and driving drum beats.     This is a record that will divide the fan-base. Those that were attracted to the dark themes will be disappointed, unless they can focus on the metaphors of the album. There is an appreciation for this record as the band has grown as artists.    As for the pop aspect of the album, many will claim that they went mainstream by using what is popular today. What Danger Days actually did was take what is popular and made it dangerous.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is by far the best dramatic series I've ever seen.  It has blown away all of my expectations and hopes, and indeed what I thought is artistically possible in this day and age.  I use the word genius sparingly, but it certainly applies to the creators of this series.<br /><br />The historical setting (Madison Avenue circa 1960) is great for showing us how times have changed during the past two generations, every character is developed and portrayed in a way that I can believe and empathize with, and countless facets of the human condition are explored with remarkable depth and nuance, so I'll assert that this series deserves to be classed with the world's great stage productions and literature (dare we mention the name of Shakespeare?).  Simply put, I've learned a lot about life and therefore myself from this series, so my appreciation goes beyond what words can express.<br /><br />If you're a reflective person who takes a real interest in what makes people and social groups tick, don't miss this series.
B000059ZLH|5.0|This is prog rock at it's best.  At every level.  If you have any inclination for this type of thing and buy anything else before this, you are making a mistake.  Video production dated, but this band is unbelievable on a technical level while delivering rapturous musicality.  Wear a diaper and a seat belt.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing! I absolutely love this! Christina's voice really shines here! And I love what they did with Marilyn Manson's Beautiful People (one of my favorite artists & songs of all time), very interesting!
0316098337|5.0|This book is enchanting. Emma Donoghue has such imagination. I could not put it down. At first I had a hard time reading the passages told through the 5 year old boy Jack. But I soon got used to it. It's very hearwarming and sad at the same time.   I highly recommend it.
1400079276|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. The language, the imagery, and particularly the relationships that developed as the stories progressed.    And the translation was a pleasure too. Just one mistranslation that I recall: complimentary breakfast, which should probably have been complementary breakfast. Otherwise, there were many uses of idiomatic English that made it seem written in English. Only the author's name and the Japanese names of the characters indicated otherwise. Unless you count what might be a Japanese sensibility regarding relationships, which tended to be gentle and evolving, rather than conflicting and stuck.
B00368PSN2|4.0|Outlander is one of those movies that really suprised me. I picked it up because I am a big sci-fi fan and I like Jim Caviezel but honestly wasn't expecting much more than a rev'd up syfy channel type of movie. Boy was I wrong! This flic is fantastic. The special effects are amazing for a film this low-key and low-budget. The creature is especially satisfying as it rides the line between creepy, cool, and savage the whole way through. The actors are strong and the story is original and enjoyable although it feels like it gets a little hung-up at times(not to bad). It even has a pretty suprising twist 2/3rds of the way through. It looks especially nice on blu-ray with the surround cranked up. If you see this at your local store grab it, or order it here. You won't be dissapointed!
0142428272|5.0|I'm a fan of the Classics, and have read all I can find in audio. Ken Follett writes books that will become classics..for sure!  He puts you right there, in that time period with detail so accurate and interesting. I heard this Trilogy would cover the late 1800's and on through WW2 which is my life time. I was born is 1931 and remember the depression and WW2 and can't wait for book 2 to come out. I loved all of his books and highly recomend them.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Gray' Anatomay is a wonderful series.

The economy is in the crapper and she has vowed not to shop! She throws a surprise birthday party for Luke with the help of many friends and one unexpected person.
B003P2WO5E|3.0|This book was fascinatingly complex and I believe the series will be like heroine for worldbuilding-novel-junkies.  However it had some issues.    Let's start with the positive:  I've read a decent amount of Brandon Sanderson (Mistborn Trilogy, Warbreaker, Elantris, his WoT takeover novels, etc) and while I did not read them by date published - which would have allowed me to see how he's developed - I noticed a significant improvement in his writing quality, particularly when it comes to brevity (show, rather than tell me 3 times) and character development (Sarene/Raoden. 'Nuff said).  By Mistborn Book 3, I was ready to quit the trilogy - and Brandon Sanderson in general - because I was so irritated at how I felt the characters had actually devolved and become more flat, more archetypal, more unable to shut up and just make a decision already, as the trilogy went on.    Way of Kings is different in that respect.  The characters are much more nuanced and much less boring.  While they do, on occasion, drone on repetitively about obvious things, their penchant for doing so is MUCH MUCH less than characters from other Sanderson novels.    A second positive:  As usual for Sanderson, the magic system is extremely interesting.  While it does bear some suspiciously strong similarities to the Mistborn magic (the concept of Pushing and Pulling, for example, and the concept of \\"burning\\" or using up your \\"magic fuel\\") it is novel enough to make me forget this.  The political system is also very interesting, and Sanderson's method of revealing the world's history (Dalinar's visions) never failed to fascinate me.    Now, the negative:  The thing that annoyed me most was Sanderson's amateurish attempts at philosophy and theology in this book.  I know this is a fantasy book, but he opened the can of worms when he made his characters start discussing their beliefs.  And when Jasnah, who is supposed to be an extremely intelligent, well-read and above all LOGICAL atheist, begins a scholarly, instructive debate with the religious Shallan, I wanted to tear my hair out.  Sanderson truncated their discussion in a way that nearly ruined the characters for me - he basically straw-manned Jasnah's atheist beliefs by refusing to respond to Shallan's extremely weak, feelings-based (NOT logic-based) arguments, while making Shallan look like an idiot because the whole time she's been studying to find \\"truth\\" the best argument she can come up with for religion is that it \\"feels right\\"!  I'm not an atheist and I'm not super religious, but if you are either, you will probably feel insulted after reading this because Sanderson makes both sides seem like idiots!    All I'm saying is, in a 1000+ page book, he could have taken an extra 2-3 pages, and actually taken the arguments to their logical ends instead of leaving them where he did.  Yes, I repeat, I KNOW it is a fantasy book, but intelligent writing incorporates the intelligent parts of multiple genres - particularly when called for.    Other negatives:  There were multiple Kaladin scenes that could have been cut, or at least had their fat trimmed.  Kaladin was my favorite character but wayyyy too much time and detail was put in to his arc.  In general, easily 200-300 pages could have been trimmed from this book (I would say this 20-25% fat ratio is about par for the course for Sanderson's writing) and this may have made it more appealing to readers who are put off by a cinderblock-sized novel that promises to be the 1st of 10 such novels.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I've really been enjoying this CD. I just recently heard of Ray LaMontagne and the Pariah Dogs so I can't compare it to anything but \\"Trouble\\", but I love both!
B004B4RCDE|3.0|Last year, Rihanna released the depressing album \\"Rated R\\" with a more dramatic element to it. Just one year later, she comes out with the exact opposite with an album called \\"Loud\\". So I'm going to give you my \\"Track By Track\\" Review followed by my overall review.     1.)S&M *****- A catchy fun song about sex and being a dominatrix. She boast \\"I may be bad but I'm perfectly good at it\\". This is one of three songs with the typical POP beat that you'd heare Lady GaGa or Katy Perry sing over.     2.)What's My Name (Feat. Drake)***** - The song reminds me of \\"Rude Boy\\" but still works for me. I personally don't think Drake should be featured on the song because it doesn't really work that well. The solo version that leaked is the better version in my opinion, but its still a solid track.    3.)Cheers (Drink To That) *** - The song didn't immediately draw my attention, but after a few listens its enjoyable. Its just not a song I'd search for on my iPod, but also not a song I'd skip if it came on next.     4.)Fading **** - An emotional song about a relationship that's falling apart. The song came too soon in the track listing. It would've fit perfectly in the last section of the album along with \\"Love the Way You Lie Part II\\"    5.)Only Girl (In the World) **** - The first single and by far the \\"Loudest\\" track on the album. I personally think the albums title should have been changed to Only Girl or something better, because this song pretty much wraps up the theme of the over all album.    6.) California King Bed *** - Slow rock ballad about a couple who's growing apart. Basically \\"Fading\\" part II.     7.) Man Down * - I really don't like this song. It sounds really Reggae and her accent is a little too forced for my taste.     8.) Raining Man (Feat. Nicki Minaj) ***** - One of my favorites on the album. And even though I'm not really a Nicki Minaj fan, I appreciate her vocals on this track. My favorite part is the chorus. Especially the \\"Oh yeah yeah, Oh Oh Oh\\" part. You have to hear it!    9.) Complicated ***** - This song is amazing. It kinda of reminds me of a more pop version of Beyonce's song \\"Scared of Lonely\\". It features a dance beat, yet its a ballad. Another Must Listen!    10.) Skin **** - Sexy song. I'd actually rearrange the track list and put this somewhere in the early part of the album instead of the breakup songs. Slow start but afterwards, its a decent listen.     11.) Love The Way You Lie Part II (Feat. Eminem) *** - Its a decent song. The original is better to me, but its still decent. Eminem changes the vibe by yelling over it, but I can't hate on the best rapper of all time!    Overall the album is a pretty decent album. Its just All over the place. I don't believe it lives up to the title. Its basically the MTV of albums. Four out of eleven tracks are \\"LOUD\\". I'd Rearrange the Track listing also.     1.) S&M  2.) Only Girl (In The World)  3.) What's My Name (Feat. Drake)  4.) Cheers (Drink To That)  5.) Skin  6.) Man Down  7.) Complicated  8.) Fading  9.) California King Bed  10.) Raining Men (Feat. Nicki Minaj)  11.) Love the Way You Lie Part II    My opinion. ;)
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Nicki's album is subpar at best. The \\"singy songy, ego-ridden, I'm better than every other female rapper out there\\" is completely wack. I'll pass, glad I didn't have to pay for this!
1400049628|5.0|This was a great buy. I am a huge Zombie fan and loved this book from start to finish. WARNING if you are not fully able to submerge yourself in the absurdity of the fact your reading a ZOMBIE SURVIVAL GUIDE you may find this kind of dry. It is written as a \\"real\\" survival guide. If you can't read a regular survival guide you might not be able to read this. I loved it though.
B003VB5E2E|3.0|First disk is OK, Second Disk is a lot better.  Truck's band is always good.  Steve Winwood was singing out of tune, and why  do the same songs over again.  Great the first time,  sucked the 2nd. time.  Citizen Cope, What's that  all about.    My biggest complaint: Bill Murray! They need to lose him.  He isn't funny, his intro's suck, and personnly I wouldn't   trust him alone with any of the female performers!!!    Come on dude, retire and work on getting a little class.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Ok, seriously this movie has to really by up your ally to really get into it, and we waited for the extended edition to come out, and we were not dissappointed! (Well the only thing that we really were dissappointed about was that there was no digital copy included, expecially since these days all Blu-Ray has that digital copy included.) If you have not seen it, I recommend this version of it...kind of explains things that in the original movie we were like, huh...wonder what the backstory is to that one.<br />Can't wait till #2!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|I ordered this dvd to replace one that was lost. A little girl's gotta have her Mermaid Movie! I received it quickly, in great condition for an excellent price. Another awesome, Amazon experience. Thank you!
B0044KU7KU|5.0|I preordered my copy of \\"Danger Days\\" from Amazon, and got it on Saturday (much to my surprise and delight, actually). I've been listening to it almost nonstop since then.    The album opens with Dr. Death-Defying leading us into this adventure with the amazing opening line, \\"Look alive, sunshine...\\" It smoothly transitions to \\"Na na na,\\" an energetic, exhilarating song that I love to listen to while walking to class in the morning. Dr. Death checks in on us in the middle of the album, and shows us out near the end. I love how they did this; it makes it seem like we actually are listening to him on the radio out in the Zones.    I'm not a fan of slow songs, so I tend to skip out on songs like \\"Bulletproof Heart\\" and \\"S/C/A/R/E/C/R/O/W\\" (although I think the latter is beautiful). \\"SING\\" is one of my favorites: it's what the Killjoys are all about- surviving, spreading your message, and f*** `em all (or, that's how I interpreted it). I also loved \\"Party Poison\\" and \\"Vampire Money\\" because of their total punk rock feel and how fun they are (I love jumping around to them). I think my favorite, though, is \\"DESTROYA.\\" It's simply amazing.    Some people who say this is a radical departure from the \\"old MCR.\\" I disagree. This is exactly what MCR is all about. It's about art, and not giving in, and being yourself. Isn't that what MCR has been promoting since day one? I guess, though, this album is very rock `n' roll, so if that isn't your thing- that isn't your thing. Still, it's fun and exciting, and you can tell that the band had an amazing time making it. It makes you want to jump up and down and sing along, and I think that is what makes it an awesome album. Buy it if you're a fan, of course, or if you want some pure rock to lift your spirits and dance to.    (Also, if you're a comic book fan like me: listening to this is exactly like being in one :D)

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Incredible!!   I believe Kanye has just created this generations' \\"What's Going On?\\" CD (Marvin Gaye)!  This product has to be purchased WHOLE...buy the CD!   This CD speaks to everyone...all cultures...all ages...all races.   Yes, \\"All Of The Lights\\" is excellent...but so is...\\"Blame Game\\", \\"Lost In The World\\" and \\"Power\\"!!   It is, without a doubt, the BEST CD of the Year!  Parents ALERT: Chris Rock is hilarious on \\"Blame Game\\"!...but it's not for the kids.  The CD is a necessary, HONEST TO GOD, epic...that needs to be listened to from start to finish until you get it out of your system (if that's possible)....damn, and I don't even like rap music.  The music is awesome.    There's nothing like great ART...the only thing missing in the world is Tiger Woods' golf game.   Tiger...go out and make Kanye your new BEST FRIEND!  Hopefully that will get your MOJO back...and please, lose the humility.  Kanye, you're a MONSTER!!!
B0013ND30M|5.0|This dvd was ordered to replace one that was lost. It was advertised as \\"used\\" at a great price. I received it quickly and to my surprise, it was wrapped, tagged and appeared to be brand new. The only negative being the coupons inside are now out-of-date! haha  Thank you for a great product with great service!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|The tagline of the chilling Swedish thriller \\"Låt den rätte komma in\\" (\\"Let the Right One in\\") goes like this: \\"Eli is 12 years old. She's been 12 for over 200 years and, she just moved in next door.\\" And Eli has a secret to hide, a big, dark secret that a 12-year-old boy Oskar, who befriends Eli, is to know very soon    Perhaps you already know the secret of Eli, an enigmatic girl with a pale face. Yes, she is a vampire. Not much is known about her past. Set in the early 80s, the film follows the story of a bullied boy Oskar and Eli, a girl who lives with a tired, middle-aged man Håkan. His past is shrouded in nearly as much mystery as Eli herself. All we know is Håkan, always faithful to Eli, is ready to do anything for her - even if it may violate laws.    \\"Let the Right One in,\\" based on the book by John Ajvide Lindqvist (which I haven't read), is not just a vampire horror. It works as a horror, and it scares us in a most unexpected way (like a stylish swimming pool sequence which is unforgettable), but the film is also a very dark version of a \\"boy-meets-girl\\" story. The difference is, their romance is not always sweet, and the couple's \\"happiness\\" does not necessarily mean that of the others around them.    Director Tomas Alfredson gives a unique twist to the now familiar conventions of vampire tales: gender-reversed roles of main characters, for instance (compare this one with the \\"Twilight\\" saga). To some viewers the most intriguing part of the film would be the untold story of Eli the vampire. Where did she come? Is she alone? The film is set in the 1980s - but why is that? Possibilities are suggested and they are open to our imagination. And what makes the film special is the cold atmosphere and the chemistry between the leads.     \\"Let the Right One in\\" is a smart vampire movie with a few things to add to the genre.

B0002XL35G|5.0|This movie is about beneficial role that modern media can sometimes play in difficult situations in achieving honesty that heals.<br /><br />At the start of the film, the main character is discovered silently wandering in the desert near the Tex-Mex border. A doctor locates the man's brother from a note in the man's wallet and the brother, a suburbanite from California, comes out to bring him home. Seems the man just up and disappeared several years before after a break-up with his wife. Slowly drawn out by his brother, the lost man begins to talk, though mostly in riddles, but always honestly, and by the time they get back to California, his human side has re-surfaced, though we can feel what an effort is in for him and also his uncertainty about wanting to return. There he is introduced to his small son, adopted by the brother and his wife after the boy's mother left the son with them. After delicate manoevers, the boy and his father get back in touch, and both decide they want to find the mother.<br /><br />The father and son take off for a city from which the mother has been sending monthly checks and, on the correct day, wait outside the bank where she deposits them. When the mother appears they follow her to the building where she works. Leaving the boy in the car, the father goes in and discovers a telephone-sex house, where women sit behind a one-way mirror and talk to or perform for the men who talk through a telephone on the dark side of the mirror. After an aborted attempt, a good dose of liquor, and a night's sleep, the father returns to the place on the next day. When his wife comes in, he tells her he wants to tell her a story, turns his chair around away from the mirror, and proceeds to tell her what happened in their lives leading to their break-up. She, of course, soon realizes who it is, and weeps through his story: how he went on jealousy fits, how he tried to keep her in and tie her down because he was afraid to lose her, how much she meant to him. When he finishes, he is so overwhelmed with emotion that he gets up to leave, but she calls him back, by name. They look around for a switch to see if she can reverse the lighting so she can see him - the first time she's ever tried to do this - and she takes her turn on the telephone telling him what went on in her mind.<br /><br />This medium of telephone distance is the only way the two of them are able to be honest enough to sort out the confusion of an intense, problematic relationship. If either of them had tried to be this honest \\"in person\\", one or both of them might well have still been too upset to handle it. But the space which the telephone set-up allows them provides the right neutral territory to be fully honest, about feelings, mistakes, regrets, and guilt. A rapprochement of sorts is reached.<br /><br />The movie will not be ruined by this synopsis; god is in the details. A gorgeous and in the end uplifting film.hes, he is so overwhelmed with emotion that he gets up to leave, but she calls him back, by name.

0345479092|5.0|I am definitely what you'd call a \\"Rookie Mom.\\"  No experience with babies at all until I had my own.  All I had was the \\"mom instinct\\" you get after delivery.  So, first and foremost, let me say that you know your baby better than anyone and, when in doubt, go with your gut.  Also, your baby can only communicate with you by crying - it's what babies do - so it's going to take a little time and know-how (and your intuition) to figure out what your baby needs when he/she needs it.  No one baby or parenting book is going to have all the answers, but this one helps in several of the immediate areas when you bring home your newborn and feel totally clueless.  Ultimately, though, always use what works for you and your child.  My daughter is now 3 yrs old and we all lived to tell about it. ;-)    My sister gave me her copy of this book, and it was worth its weight in gold simply for the charts on what your baby's cries could be signaling.  While I did find the author's tone pretentious and condescending at times, it was worth dealing with just for her information on \\"baby language\\", as well as how to develop a routine - not a schedule - that works with your baby's built-in rhythms and needs.  While the information on how to put your baby down when drowsy so he/she learns how to (eventuallly) go to sleep on his/her own was also worth its weight in gold, I felt the chapter itself wasn't completely developed.  (I relied on \\"Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Child\\" by Weissbluth for more indepth sleep information.)    Despite the pretention, the British author does seem like a caring individual and does promote treating your baby as a person and individual, as well as trying to persuade us Americans to slow down and respect the fact that babies have different needs than adults do, needs that are often much slower and quieter.  To me, this was welcome advice in our (sometimes insanely) fast-paced culture.

B004CAWKXE|5.0|This album is amazing. It's not an emo album, or a rock opera. It's just flat out rock and roll. It's been a while since I've heard an album this good. And, it's only $4 to download....buy it ASAP

1400079144|1.0|The first half of the book was great, it went down hill fast. Landon made the same religous argument to three characters. The killers true identidy is unbelievable; and there is no pay-off to the novel. I was waiting for the big ending that never happened..\\"so thats it..what?!\\"
B003NX6ZDC|4.0|The ever ambitious Brandon Flowers takes the time that The Killers are on break from making music to...make music. \\"Flamingo,\\" like the Springsteen influenced \\"Sam's Town,\\" is another ode to Las Vegas, except this time, Flowers decides to run stylistically amok. Surprisingly enough, it works. I've come to enjoy \\"Flamingo\\" more than I did The Killers' \\"Day and Age.\\"<br /><br />Once again, Flowers is feeling is inner Bruce, but it seems more tempered this time. The duet with Jenny Lewis on \\"Hard Enough\\" has a softer core than most of The Killers' best songs yet rates right up there with the band for emotional impact. I suspect producer Daniel Lanois' touch in the more atmospheric sound, as Flowers allows the songs to breathe on their own. Not that Flowers resists the urge to rock; both \\"Crossfire\\" and \\"Was It Something I Said\\" could easily have been Killers songs.<br /><br />What one can hope for from \\"Flamingo\\" is that maybe some of what Flowers has picked up will rub off on his regular band; I'd love to hear them take on the slow-burn build-up of a song like \\"Jilted Lovers and Broken Hearts.\\" Or maybe see if The Killers could take on something as tempered as \\"Playing With Fire.\\" A pleasant surprise overall, \\"Flamingo\\" reinforces the notion that Flowers is a serious talent with ambition to burn.
0575085096|2.0|I'd heard a lot about these books.  The Disc World series is huge and even has a few movies to its name.  I decided it had to be good right?  Well, to be honest, I was very disappointed in this book.  It wasn't near what I expected from all the hype that accompanied Pratchett's books.<br /><br />The Colour of Magic is the first book in the series, although I've heard that they can mostly be read as stand-alones.  Which is probably a good thing since I believe there are over thirty novels in the series.  This one involved two main characters of Rincewood the incompetent wizard and Twoflower, a bumbling tourist.  They encounter a myriad of characters along the way, including Death. Coerced into keeping Twoflower safe, Rincewood encounters all sorts of hazards and people trying to kill them.  Especially since Death himself is interested in Rincewood.  They travel and meet dragons, edge-worlders (Discworld is of course a disc, balanced on the backs of four elephants who in turn stand on a turtle), trolls, and other strange beasts, most of whom are not very friendly.<br /><br />Rincewood and Twoflower are not very exciting characters.  They don't have a lot of development and their conversations are not very intriguing.  Rincewood especially I just found annoying.  There is only so far you can make someone inept and he didn't really seem to have any redeeming qualities.  Just a lot of luck.  Twoflower is little better, but at least he has some interesting background compared to Rincewood.<br /><br />The writing was very jumpy.  So many characters and and places were introduced in the beginning that I never got them sorted out in my head before having to move on to the next thing in the plot.  The story also jumped around a lot.  I'd no sooner get to one point in the novel then it seemed that they were already on a new adventure without resolving the last.  I just wasn't a big fan of the way it flowed.  There were a few funny moments, but it wasn't enough to make up for the majority of the book.<br /><br />I do hope these books get better.  I'm going to try a few more because there's got to be a reason the series is so popular.  I have heard that the writing and plots get better so I am somewhat excited to read more.  Here's hoping that I can leap into Discworld with further novels.<br /><br />The Colour of Magic<br />Copyright 1983<br />210 pages + extras<br /><br />Review by M.

0812979656|2.0|Hard to credit the hype surrounding this book.  Endlessly repetitive, rather silly word play, some scenic descriptions, but characters who never rise above banality of thought, word, or action.  Like so many novels published today, could be cut by a third or a half. \\"Post-colonial\\" so important on that account(?), but perhaps when the empire next writes back it can raise the intellectual bar and omit the sentimentality.

0316010669|4.0|In Blink, Gladwell applies his popular writing style to the investigations of making snap decisions.  Gladwell uses anecdotes and the results of scientific research to illustrate several different theories into how the subconscious part of our minds will quickly sort through a vastly large number of variables and lead us to a conclusion.  Blink gives examples of when our first impression are more accurate than doing hours of research.  However, Gladwell quickly follows his first example of gut instinct is right with stories when gut instinct and first impressions are wrong.  The final third part of the book attempts to examine when first instincts are likely to be correct, and what efforts we can individually make to improve our accuracy in making split second decisions.<br /><br />Gladwell contends that we develop biases that harm are ability to make accurate quick decisions.  Once we are aware of these biases, rather than try to remove them from our culture, we should try to find ways to eliminate them from becoming a variable in our subconscious.  He uses the example of having classical musicians audition behind a screen to avoid gender and posture biases.  Gladwell argues that by gaining education and experience in a subject, we become better at making fast decisions in a given field.<br /><br />What is notably lacking in Blink is a defined prescription for how we can use this information to better make quick decisions, and precisely when we should deliberate long and hard or simply follow our gut.  Gladwell's general suggestions do not satisfy the questions raised in the readers mind over the course of the book. Although some readers may find this annoying, I think it is unfair to hold the absence of answers against the authors work.  Gladwell has thrown these ideas out into the public discourse, now as a society we can think about how we are thinking and perhaps someday research will give a nice flow chart of when we should think on our feet, control our environment for better bias control, or spend hours on statistical analysis.etter bias control, or spend hours on statistical analysis.

B004BC7MRM|5.0|For 4 bucks, I figured I'd give this one a shot... at this point, my answer to the question is a loud \\"Hell yeah!\\"     That should also be surprising given that I'm neither a Kid Rock fan nor a huge Country follower. Yes I do listen to hip-hop, and yes I do listen to some Country. What caught me off guard after my first listening is how much he's moved away from his earlier career. The album is very maturity and extremely consistent, something that some artists who are caught get older seem to be unable achieve. It appears he's seen his future, and it's not being a middle aged rapper/hip-hop star...    Born Free falls into a very small, but very distinct category of albums for me personally, that's the category of albums where I enjoyed every song with the first listen.

B002PMV9FG|3.0|Through five previous films, this title, and two more to go, we've watched our little friends and the actors who portray them grow up before our eyes!  This, in itself, has made the series fun and enjoyable.  I read the books, and enjoyed the previous film adaptations, but this was the first film I left the theater disappointed.    The original film tried to pack every detail from the book into its already lengthy running time, resulting in a breakneck pace that gave the viewer little time to really hone in on the characters.  The following two films, in my opinion the pinnacle of the film series, found just the right beat, with few sacrifices.  The fourth film, based as it was on a book three times longer, still managed to bring a fantastic adaptation, even with drastic amounts of material cut. The fifth film, Order of the Phoenix, was the first I thought should have been better, even while subsequent viewings have made me appreciate it all the more.    But now, the sixth film in the series, I found myself for the first time really feeling disappointed as I left the theater, feeling like the whole thing was a waste of time.  My second viewing, here on DVD, went much better, yet I STILL feel the end of this film is a huge letdown.      The key to enjoying these latter films is divorcing them completely from the books.  If you overlook the glaring amount of material missing and just take them as their own creations, they are quite enjoyable.  Bearing that in mind, for the purpose of this review, I will not be referring to the book anymore - that approach is already done to death here.  The book is the book, the movie is the movie. Yet even with this tactic, HALF-BLOOD PRINCE, comes up short.      The film begins with Harry meeting Horace Slughorn, the new potions professor, who Dumbledore wants Harry to get close to in order to retrieve a secret memory regarding Voldemort's days at Hogwarts.  With this information, Dumbledore hopes to reveal the Dark Lord's weaknessto aid in the coming final battle.  This, in a nutshell, is the thrust of the film. The first two-thirds contain all the usual charm and fun we've come to enjoy in the series.  Best of all, the content has matured with the characters, so the humor is not nearly so childish, nor are the themes.  There are some truly terrifying images in this film (particularly a disturbing near death experience encountered by one of the female students midway through).  The majority of the film, in other words, works quite well.    The problem is twofold:  firstly, at this point Ron and Hermione are nearly side characters, whose scenes come and go quickly, as though getting them out of the way.  The story is now focused almost solely on Harry's quest to overcome Voldemort.  This leaves little for Ron and Hermione to do but get embroiled in romance problems in the background. Other beloved characters, such as Hagrid, Crabbe and Goyle, Neville, and the Phoenix members are reduced to mere cameos.  Some, like the Durselys, are wholly absent.    The larger problem, though, comes in the film's final conflict.  Whereas ORDER OF THE PHOENIX built to one of the most jaw-droppingly awesome moments in the entire franchise, the finale of this film was markedly less exciting.  Without giving too much away, we learn that one student's entire year came down to setting one series of events into motion, yet we never really see what was so vital in what he was doing.  When it comes down to it, the deed needing to be done is carried out by someone who was already at Hogwarts all along.      Furthermore, when we learn who the titular \\"half-blood prince\\" is, it's almost an afterthought.  The character literally says, \\"yes, I'm the half-blood prince\\" and then walks off the scene.  No follow up, no conversation about what this means and why its important.  It's a tremendously weak moment in an overwhelmingly weak ending.  Worst of all, unlike the previuos films, we are left with no real concluding moment -just more of a \\"to be continued\\" style ending, much like the FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS ending.  Perhaps the concluding films will make up for this, but as it stands, the film is almost completely undone by this underwhelming ending.    To compound matters, the image quality is horrendous.  The film itself was lit and graded very darkly, but coupled with Warner Bros. typically shoddy transfer, and you are left with a badly artifacted, dark, and dreary image most of the way through.      At the end of the day, even with a lackluster ending, I still enjoyed the film, even if it stands currently as the weakest in the series (to be fair, the book is also my least favorite).  Coupled with the poor image, its hard to endorse this product.  I feel generous giving it three stars, but that is totally due to the quality of the actors, music, effects, and direction.  Thankfully, these areas still stand firm!

B003EYVXSW|1.0|If I get a movie from the library, and there isn't anything else on TV to watch, I try to at least watch the thing so my time was not wasted picking it up.    I wasted my time anyway. This movie was not worth the effort of even putting it in the DVD player.    The story line was lame. The boyfriend's going along blindly with his crazy ass girlfriend was lame. Acting as though they could actually pull off carrying on this whole experiment in secrecy was lame.

B003Y5H4VG|5.0|Remember Joe Wilson, the man who called a US President a liar?      No, I don't mean the Congressman from South Carolina who shouted out a spontaneous \\"You Lie!\\" at President Barack Obama during the State of the Union address.  I'm referring to Ambassador Joseph C. Wilson who wrote a New York Times editorial entitled \\"What I Didn't Find In Africa\\" contradicting President George W. Bush regarding the existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.     \\"Fair Game\\" relates to the latter Joe Wilson (played by Sean Penn), who served as a diplomat in Africa during the 1990's and was asked to visit Niger prior to the Iraqi war to determine if there was yellowcake uranium there. Ambassador Wilson did not find the uranium on his visit and when the President referred to the uranium being there, he wrote a contradiction.     As a result of that contradiction, Wilson's wife CIA agent Valerie Plame (Naomi Watts) was determined to be 'fair game' by the Bush Administration. Her cover was blown and the operations she engaged in were all scrapped, including getting Iraqi nuclear scientists who had been involved in Iraq's nuclear program before it was destroyed during a previous US invasion and their families free from their war-torn country.    The film's a tightly paced combination spy thriller and domestic drama.  On one hand, you see the front page news of \\"Plamegate\\".  Valerie's discredited and her career is dismantled. She goes from being a well-traveled agent with highly critical projects to 'a secretary' or a 'low level flunky' depending on what you read.     On the other, you see the Wilson homelife unraveling. The idealistic Joe is counterpointed strongly by his realistic wife as the country turns against them both. They receive countless threats, to the point of Valerie having to remove her children from their home.     This investigation resulted in the case, US vs. Libby in which Vice President Dick Cheney's aide Scooter Libby was  tried on five federal felony counts.Libby was convicted on four of those charges, involving false statements, perjury, and obstruction of justice, none of which related directly to the Plame revelation but rather to his failure to cooperate with the subsequent investigation into the revelation. Libby was sentenced to 30 months in prison and a fine of $250,000. President Bush subsequently commuted Libby's sentence.

B002VPE1AW|4.0|As a filmmaker, James Cameron is a thrill master, but not a deep thinker. The themes in his films, noble as they are, are nothing new, and his futuristic ideas are old hat compared to what's explored in the best science-fiction literature. His plots are sturdy and formulaic, designed to entertain but not to innovate. The dialogue can be fun, but is often trite and rarely poetic or profound. Yet the man knows how to enthrall and deliver \\"shock and awe,\\" and along the way he inevitably moves the craft and technology of filmmaking up to a higher level. \\"Terminator 2\\" dazzled with the new CGI effect of morphing; \\"Titanic\\" set a new standard for disaster-movie realism; and \\"Avatar\\" has set the bar higher for digitally created characters and 3D filmmaking. More importantly perhaps, it offers the audience a compelling immersion in a simulated reality, an experience somewhere between watching a movie in a theatre and entering a virtual world in cyberspace.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" is a beautiful movie, stunningly so at times, yet it isn't due to artful cinematography in the sense of poetic images and striking composition. Rather, the visual splendor lies in the inherent beauty of the alien world in which we are immersed. Pandora's lush rain forest, its colorful flora and fauna, the spectacular gorges and long waterfalls, and the moons and blue Jovian-type planet Polyphemus in the sky are rendered with painstaking detail and depth. Cameron has created a convincing exoplanet environment, worth the price of admission all on its own.<br /><br />Visually, \\"Avatar\\" owes a debt to artist Roger Dean, known for his Yes album covers in the 1970s. The film's floating \\"Hallejulah Mountains\\" and dragon-like banshees appear based on the levitating mountains and fantastic dragons of Dean's fantasy-art paintings. There are also resonances of movies like \\"The Lost World\\" and \\"King Kong\\" in which dinosaurs and exotic bugs roamed tropical jungles. Most of all, Cameron seemed inspired by his post-Titanic fondness of exploring the deep sea in submersibles; he has transplanted the ocean's bioluminescent fauna and hovering creatures (like jellyfish) in altered forms into a rain-forest environment.<br /><br />At moments, the phosphorescent colors are a little too intense and feel like an interlude in a '60s \\"black light\\" room full of psychedelic art; of course, this may endear the movie to future generations of chemically altered viewers. My other minor complaint about the Pandoran reality was Cameron's apparent obsession with optical fibers, tendril-like versions of which keep popping up all over the place, from the Na'vi-animal interfaces to the Tree of Souls. Or perhaps it's an obscure reference to Carlos Castaneda's books, which describe us all as being composed of \\"luminous fibers\\"?<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" may have borrowed some ideas or at least names from the great Russian science-fiction authors Arkady and Boris Strugatsky; the brothers' \\"Noon Universe\\" (or \\"World of Noon\\") cycle of novels from the 1960s included a lushly forested planet called Pandora populated by a humanoid race called the Nave. Cameron's movie also follows in the footsteps of the Edgar Rice Burroughs \\"John Carter of Mars\\" novels, as did George Lucas's \\"Star Wars\\" films. In the John Carter tales, a paralyzed Civil War hero \\"incarnates\\" in a facsimile of his own body on Mars, where he fights with and against red and green-skinned Martians, falls in love with a red princess, and encounters many strange beasts.<br /><br />Some have said that \\"Avatar\\" is yet another story of an individual from a colonialist nation who joins an exploited society, sees the world through their eyes, and becomes a hero or messiah. At the end, he atones for his own culture's imperialistic sins (call it \\"white guilt\\" if you will, but skin color is not the point). Certainly, \\"Avatar\\" owes more than a little to movies like \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" and the Na'vi people resemble lanky ten-foot-tall blue Native Americans andshare some of their spirituality. The Na'vi worship nature and have a reverence for all living beings, including those they must kill in order to survive. \\"Avatar\\" decries the genocide of indigenous peoples and the plundering of nature in order to seize natural resources (unobtainium in this case rather than oil or gold). Casting the Cherokee actor Wes Studi (\\"Dances with Wolves,\\" \\"Last of the Mohicans\\") as the character Eytucan reinforces the Native-American connection on a subliminal level. Yet while \\"Avatar\\" is undeniably political, it is mostly archetypal.<br /><br />\\"Avatar\\" takes us on the hero's journey (as per mythologist Joseph Campbell) or a reluctant hero's adventure (as per screenwriting courses). Stories of outsiders who enter other cultures, endure trials, and become heroes are heard around the world. And the desire of city folk to experience tribal life, at least via a ripping yarn, has probably been a campfire staple ever since most of humanity moved from being hunter-gatherers to farmers and merchants. And doesn't everyone fantasize about starting life completely anew, in another place or time? (In this case, it's with an alien body with working legs in a far-away solar system.)<br /><br />The movie's title and Jake Sully's conscious immersion in a Na'vi body bring up other spiritual elements. In Hindu mythology, an \\"avatar\\" is the manifestation of one deity as another (such as Krishna being an avatar, or incarnation, of Vishnu). In video games and virtual reality, an avatar is the on-screen representation of a player, who controls its behavior. For most of the movie, the latter definition applies; the Na'vi is a representation of Jake. He experiences the world remotely through the Na'vi body's senses and controls it like a puppet, while his consciousness remains in his own body. At the end, his mind is transferred to the new body via the Tree of Souls. In other words, he goes from being a \\"cyberspace avatar\\" to a full, new incarnation. When it happens, are those luminous tendrils/fiber-optic cables channeling Jake's soul (as per much Earthly religious belief) or a neural net that constitutes his mind (as per materialists)? It would appear that they are one and the same on Pandora, as all living organisms are connected there to the same \\"bio-botanical neural network.\\" (On our Earth, science is still working out the riddle of consciousness.)<br /><br />As a story, \\"Avatar\\" offers a recycling of familiar elements; as an experience it breaks new ground.

B0000CEB4V|5.0|Billy Preston's version of My Sweet Lord is by far the moving earthshaking moment of a beautifully done tribute. I am positive that George is looking down from above giving Billy and his mates a big thumbs up. I'm a guy and I'll tell you just listening to that song could make you cry. A great concert all around for the \\"quiet\\" Beatle who happen to be one of the world's great songwriters. George from a mere earthing I say we all miss you down here on earth. Godspeed my friend.
B000002U82|5.0|I loved this album in the 70's, love it still. One of my favourites. It's ageless. I will never get tired of it. Thank goodness for CD's as my record player no longer works. I reckon Pink Floyd were also way ahead of their time. Every number on this album is fabulous, and all so different. Great sounds. Another album which should be listend to with earphones! Their music is so very progressive;   A must for every record collection! My only regret is that I never saw them live. At least I have the music.
B0043A0PXU|3.0|I've always loved listening (and dancing!) to Annie's music, so I was excited enough to order this far before its release. After giving it a listen, I'm ambivalent about this CD. The mixture of Christmas songs is very interesting -- traditional carols along with more unusual ones mixed in -- and the arrangements are so creative to be nearly startling. For example, Annie chose the less traditional Forest Green melody for Track #10, \\"Oh Little Town of Bethlehem,\\" and weaves African drumming, penny whistle, and other embellishments into other tracks. There are small, delightful surprises in the way that each song unfolds.<br /><br />While these ingredients and arrangements *should* have resulted in a 5-star album, what detracts (and distracts) from the music is, surprisingly, Annie's singing; every song is belted out at full throttle, on 8 cylinders. It's the equivalent of a bright, unrelenting sun that makes you squint. I know: that's how she sings. But some of these songs beg for softer expression, or at least nuance, and yet there's almost no varying from the FORCE with which she sings.<br /><br />(The other distraction: on track #1, she sings \\"excelsis\\" wrong -- or else this word is pronounced very differently in the UK than in the US.)<br /><br />I'm glad to have this in my music library, but it won't get played as often as my other Christmas music.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|WOW, this movie just adds more memories to me since i grew up watching toy story 1 and 2. although im over 18 years of age now this movie brought out the kid in me:c)Woody as always will always be my fav!. Even if you never seen 1 and 2 you will genuinely enjoy this movie. It has enough emotion for you to feel the friendship and bond these toys share with one another. In Blu-ray the movie looks amazing. The animation has really improved since the original back in 95. Great extras. The new characters are a great addition to the toy story family. This movie is packed with adventure, comedy and friendship. I saw this movie 3x already:) Enjoy:-)
0553582038|1.0|too much time between books and a very very weak 4th book - it seems he is too caught up with his HBO series to actually FINISH the series
0689878451|5.0|If you are looking for a way to let little ones know about all types of families - and the many sizes and shapes they come in - this is the book. It's a great read at home or in the classroom just to explain that some children may have two daddies or two mommies.
B0015AARJI|1.0|The Playstation controller i purchased was shipped to me from Hong Kong.  When i downloaded the recent updates to my ps3 the controller quit working.  Come to find out it is a fake controller made to look and function just like one from sony.  The controller has no FCC ID or UL listing.  Don't get screwed outta $45 like i did!  Buy one from a store.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|My son introduced me to the Black Keys. I didn't know young men were out there producing such stunning music! Being an aged rocker, I love the blues and rock&roll. I will be ever grateful for the introduction to this group - I'm totally hooked!  The albums I have heard so far, are all so different. A new experience every time.  Attack and Release is one of my favourites. It's like nothing I've ever heard before. Laid back bluesy rock.   I play them on the way to work and back. Can't get enough. Every song on this album is fabulous. I esp. love All you Ever Wanted, So he Won't Break and Lies. Love the Bluegrass sound on Psychotic Girl! But love em all. Not one I don't like.  These boys are gifted and hope they continue to make such stunning music.
0756665949|5.0|What a fabulous arrangement of everything you could possibly want to know about LOST and its characters! It is alphabetical and easy to navigate. The graphics are stunning, the information thorough and detailed, and it is all creatively arranged. There are connections to \\"the numbers,\\" even references to things that were mentioned once on the show. I definitely recommend it for \\"Losties\\" as it serves to bridge some gaps without giving away too much.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|This movie had mixed reactions from critics and audiences worldwide. The negative reviews bash this movie in a unfair way. this movie is not only visually stunning but has great character with a simple story and emotional scenes. In bluray you will see so much amazing detail in the digital world and characters. The picture quality in Bluray is amazing and breathtaking. This bundle has a whole lot of extras and \\"making of Avatar\\" stuff. The making of this movie documentary is one of the most if not the most interesting and entertaining \\"making of\\" ive seen in a DVD/Blu-ray. All the work that whent into making this film is monumental.<br /><br />Movie- 3 1/2 stars<br />Extras/making of-5 stars<br />Blu-ray picture quality- 5 stars<br /><br />Again: the movie itself has flaws, but over all its a action packed adventure with great characters. Enjoy:-)
B0002NRQTI|2.0|A lot of it sounds the same.  I love Rush, but I believe they lost their luster around Signals.  Everything started sounding the same.  The explosiveness and creativity kind of went down the drain.  Still would love to see them live, but nothing compares to the stuff they did prior to Moving Pictures.
0439023513|5.0|This book is an excellent ending to the perfect trilogy. I read all three of these books in a week (that is fast for me)!! They grab you, and you can't put it down. SO sad there are not more....I dont know what to read now!!
B000F2C87Q|5.0|I think perhaps this is my favourite Black Keys album so far (hard choice!)  (see review of Attack & Release, The Big Come Up and Magic Potion). I would have given it 10 stars!  This album totally blew me away.  Real authentic, old time blues - but better. Much better. Almost makes me want to cry, so beautiful is it. The Black Keys playing these numbers of Junior Kimbrough - indescribable.  It's a shame Junior died before they could get together. I bet they would have had some awesome jamming sessions!  This album is definitely addictive.  I just can't get enough of it. From the first number to the last. Stunning, stunning. Meet me in the City - ohmy!  The boys have it down to a fine art.  The world is richer by having such excellent music being produced. I know it enriches my soul.  I have only one complaint:  the album is not long enough! Only 6 songs!  You are just getting interested then it's finished. So you play it until it's worn through.  Make sure you get a few copies!  I CAN ONLY HOPE THEY WILL MAKE MORE ALBUMS OF THIS NATURE! With many more songs of Junior Kimbrough! They have proved they are up to this music! This style suits them. And they even have the blessing of Mildred, Junior's widow. The Blues has always been the backbone of good, long lasting music. You just can't beat the blues. The blues forefathers would be proud. The Blues certainly has stood the test of time.  SO GO BOYS, MORE OF THIS PLEASE!
B000O78KW4|5.0|I remember the last time I saw this flick before now-September 10,2001.  Too much of life imitating art there.  Regardless this is my favorite entry in the series and the reasons are manifold.  Firstly, John McTiernan returns to helm the action and return it to the blue collar roots of the first film.  Secondly, Jeremy Iron's tongue-in-cheek villainy if not the equal of Alan Rickman's in the first is at least comparable.  Primarily the film's real selling point is the rapport between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.  These guys riff of each other like they've been doing it for years.  No offence to Reginald VelJohnson but he's more at home with Steve Urkel then being in these two fisted affairs.  I don't think there has been a misfire in the whole series but for my money I'll take this one followed by the original.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh is an extraordinary artist/vocalist. His vocal abilities continue to astound us with its soaring range and richness; enough to leave one a bit breathless!   He becomes more of an extrovert in this album, luring us into his head and his heart. And all I am left with is a feeling of,... wow.
0061777250|5.0|I have read many books in the area of Near Death Experience.  This book is perhaps one of the most balanced and insightful book to date on the topic of NDE and human consciousness.  The reality of human consciosness remains an enigma.  Certainly, the materialist explanation of the  reality of human consciousness cannot explain the experiences of millions of human beings that report experiences of a transcendental nature.  Dr. von Lommel's book will propel the discussion about the NDE and human consciousness to the next level whereby we may need to move to a new paradigm concerning the nature of human consciousness.    Theologians and Philosophers have been hestiant to jump into these waters; and rightfully so.  However, the mounting evidence about NDEs and human consciousness may force the discussion.  However, one may not look for and expect conclusive answers,  After all, we are discussing the central mystery of reality, God.  We cannot, in human terms, have the final word about these experiences.  But at least, we are reminded that there is far more in heaven and on earth than are drempt of in our philosophies.
0451169514|2.0|This is the first Stephen King book I read, I am in my late 20's, and I found \\"It\\" quite disappointing. It's definitely not a masterpiece and not really scary.    The story is about a monster ('It') that kills children; and a fellowship of 7 little children that decide to fight It. Language-wise it's an easy read, and the main story is kind of ok.    The big minus of the book is the enormous amount of details that do not contribute much to the story. The passages of irrelevant details are so long, and the horror scenes are so sparse, that whatever thrill builds up from one horror scene evaporates until you reach the next one. Moreover, I can't help but think  that the group-sex scene was a cheap trick for the book to attract attention.
B000063WDH|5.0|Another favourite of mine (see review of Attack & Release), more rock with a touch of blues. My fav kind of music. This one really gets me through heavy traffic!  Tune in and tune out to the road rage. It's heart-pumping, foot stomping get up and boogie kind of music! Puts a smile on my face even in the heaviest traffic. I'm totally happy and chilled when listening to the Black Keys. One can't but help loving \\"Countdown\\", \\"Yearnin'\\". But again, all the numbers are excellent. Unlike some groups, when you've heard one song, you've heard them all.   I would put a big sticker on these albums: BEWARE, ADDICTIVE!  (but in a nice way!)
B002ZG977Y|3.0|I went into this flick without any point of reference.  Mythology used to put me to sleep in college with this god begetting this god and the nonesuch.  I was just looking for a good popcorn movie and for the most part this remake fit the bill.  Liam Neeson as Zeus is pretty much in paycheck mode and Ralph Fiennes chews the scenery as Hades.  The effects are pretty good and they service the story to a point.  Final verdict it has a good beat and I could dance to it so on a scale of one to ten I give it a six.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I love this album!  One of my friends says that it is better than Unbreakable but I say they are different.  \\"Unbreakable\\" (2007)is more piano driven whereas \\"This is Us\\" has a more R&B, dance feel.  The Boys shine with \\"PDA\\" and \\"She's a Dream.\\"  Awesome gift!
B00428CPUY|5.0|There were lots of stellar performances by various musicians, notably the Trucks/Tedeschi Band, but Jeff Beck's take on Puccini's Nessun Dorma was in fact worth the price all by itself.  Seeing world class musicians backstage with tears welling up in their eyes says it more poignantly than I ever could.  Bill Murray and Citizen Cope, on the other hand...
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Was Danger Days worth waiting 4 years for? the anserw is simple yes. This is not the same My Chemical Romance from the Black Parade, no its deffinetly not them. But thats not a bad thing infact its quite the opposite. Danger Days shows how far MCR has come from being just a small band from Jersey. The best thing about this album is that there is no genere, the songs are so diverse that there is no way anyone cant find at least one song off this album that they like. I personaly cant find a song I dont like each song is beutifuly writin both lyricaly and instrumently. The production quality is out of this world its increadably crisp and crystal clear. I have really nothing bad to say about this album if i had to pick out aything it would probally the japanesse woman in party posion but the song is so amazing and her part is so short that its really not even worth writing about but i dont want you to think this is just some fanboy ranting and id be honest if this album sucked. If you didnt like MCR before you should at least listen through this cd first you may be suprised, but if you are a mcr fan this may not be the same MCR but never the less its still MCR and you should fall in love with this album as I did. I gave this album a perfect score because its diverse, well writin, its production quality is unmatched.
B0009WFDR4|5.0|Another one of my favourite albums, which to me is ageless. Ahead of their time! Loved it in the 60's, love it still. Love the story of Happiness Stan - very entertaining, and i'm sure written under the influence of some mind bending drugs - just not normal!  Excellent! get it!
1567403913|5.0|I reviewed this once before. I purchased it for my grandson for a college class and he lives in the central AR area. I assume he liked it just fine because I've heard no complaints. It was delivered as promised - quickly and the product, although used, evidently worked fine.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|In 2004, Kanye West had a five year plan for four albums. He already had the titles mapped out- \\"The College Dropout\\", \\"Late Registration\\", \\"Graduation\\" and \\"Good A$$ Job\\". He seemed intent on following through on that plan- at least until 2008, when he decided to take an instant detour. He lost his girlfriend and his mother died by the end of 2007, resulting in the melancholy and very misunderstood \\"808's & Heartbreak\\". Now, he's back with his new album, which originally had \\"Good A$$ Job\\" as the working title, but was later changed to \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". This recording marks his fifth album- and second not to be released on the vinyl format, following 2007's \\"Graduation\\". On this new album, he wanted to pull out all of the stops, by having The RZA, Pete Rock, Q-Tip and Madlib produce songs on the album. After the recording of the album, only one of the producers made the final cut. Assisting Kanye on production is Justin Vernon of the indie rock band Bon Iver and his longtime mentor No I.D., who also worked with Kanye on \\"808's & Heartbreak\\" as well as half of Jay-Z's 2009 album \\"The Blueprint 3\\".<br /><br />The album begins with the RZA produced \\"Dark Fantasy\\", complete with an operatic chorus. Another Wu-Tang member Raekwon appears alongside Kid Cudi on \\"Gorgeous\\". S1 of the Texas group Strange Fruit Project produces the first single \\"Power\\" and Bink hands in the Rick Ross assisted bitter ex-girlfriend rant \\"Devil In A New Dress\\". Pusha T of the Clipse steals the show with his guest appearance on the nine minute \\"Runaway\\". Kanye delivers a piano driven ballad \\"Blame Game\\" with a duet with his protege John Legend and an amusing ending by Chris Rock. \\"Hell Of A Life\\" shows Kanye in marital bliss with an adult film star. The songs \\"All Of The Lights\\" and \\"Lost In The World\\" have a who's who of superstar lineups: Fergie of the Black Eyed Peas, Drake, Elly Jackson of La Roux, Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Charlie Wilson of The Gap Band- even Elton John!!! While the songs are great, they have an innate tendency to run a bit on the lengthy side. In a nutshell, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" is a great and compelling listen, but the artistic statements can be overkill and a bit excessive. Love him or hate him, Kanye will never disappoint.songs are great, they have an innate tendency to run a bit on the lengthy side.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I ordered this sharpener when the blade on my leatherman skeletool started to lose it's razor edge.  The knife blade on it is 1/3 serrated and made of 154cm steel, it's extremely hard and comes razor sharp from the manufacturer,  holds it's edge very well, but I've read that it's supposed to be difficult to sharpen.  I skipped using the carbide part of the sharpener and went right to the ceramic, I pulled the straight part of the blade through perhaps eight times and used the fold-out rod at a twenty degree angle to give the serrated part around five swipes per tooth.  Afterward, I dropped a piece of paper from a foot above while holding my leatherman blade up and it slipped across in two pieces with perfectly smooth edges.  Amazingly sharp, you could shave with this edge.    After being impressed by the job it did on my leatherman, I decided to try it on my Wusthof classic ikon six inch chef knife, and it came out a fair bit sharper than the Wusthof steel I've always used to maintain the knife set after six pulls through the sharpener.  It took less time and hassle than I'm used to, and both of the blades I sharpened are extremely hard steel that I thought a small pocket sized sharpener to be unable to deal with, but it did an absolutely perfect job.  I highly recommend this item to anyone who wishes to maintain an amazing edge on their knives, not only standard pocket knives or lower end blades but on high end, high quality blades as well.
B000GPIPD8|5.0|I did not think their albums could get better. Magic Potion is stunning! (see review of Attack & Release and The Big Come Up).  I am really amazed at the talent of these boys, and there is only two in the band! Unbelievable!  Very rock and roll but underlying blues. Sure gets your foot a'tapping.  Every song a winner.  Long may they continue to release such excellent music.  I aim to collect all their albums. (at the moment all my other cd's are gathering dust).
B00004VXF2|1.0|Take an electric guitar or two, plug them into amps, turn it all on, and leave the room for an hour...with the tape rolling and recording the feedback.  Apparently, Lou even left the building for some coffee during this time! This, according to Diana Clapton, is how MMM was 'created' (her book is Lou Reed and the Velvet Underground). In other words, Lou doesn't even play on it. So, for those raving about this album, you may want to ask yourselves how much you're reading into it (comparisons to Tangerine Dream -- gimme a break!). Lou was hardly trying to be avant garde or experimental...trying to get out of a contract is more like it.    MMM may be an album, but there ain't any music on it. There ain't no Lou on it. And there sure ain't no grand design behind it. It's a slab of white noise conceived to antagonize, alienate, and snub the record company, who pulled hundreds of copies off the shelves as soon as it was released. And it's not as if the vinyl was defective -- that's how embarrassing it was/is.     On THAT level, great album, brilliant move, one-of-a-kind act of bravery and commitment to principles (or a 'particular' state of mind). Think about it: a DOUBLE album (pricey), undiluted feedback, no songs, no playing, no band, no artist, no rehearsal, no nuffin. Lou is giving them 100% trash to sell and they fell for it. The affrontery of it. It's a wonder he's is still around to tell the tale (one of his many versions, anyway).     But while MMM gives the record company the finger, the sounds on it cannot, should not be mistaken for anything closely resembling an artistic project...when it was designed by Lou to be the exact opposite: A stink bomb.    (And the Stockhousen, etc. comparisons from some other reviewers are not lost on me.)    So, the question is, what do you give it? One star or five?     I'll give it one, since there's no reason for a re-release (remastered too, are they crazy?), when the story behind it is far, FAR more entertaining.    (By theway, I'm one of the suckers who was quick enough to buy a vinyl copy before they disappeared.  Wish I had waited!)

B00479SVBU|5.0|[[ASIN:B00479SVBU Soundfly AUX MP3 Player Car Fm Transmitter for SD Card, USB Stick, Mp3 Players (iPod, Zune, Sansa) with Remote Control]] has been the first Satechi product I have purchased. I have been extremely pleased with my purchase. I love the menu, folder, and navigation functions when listening to media I have on my SD cards. I am using 4GB cards presently. They only take a few seconds to load. When you can organize media into folders its wonderful to be able to use the Navigation function and get to what you want to listen to fast. I mostly listen to books. So I name my folders after the book, navigate to the book I want and play. Bookmark it when I stop and it resumes when I start the car back up.<br /><br />I also listen to books on my Sansa through the Soundfly. Its the only way prestently I have to listen to the books I get through Audible.com. Doing it through Sansa you then use the Sansa menu and functions for pausing and playing and such. The Soundly essentially is your \\"headphone set\\". If you have an SD card or USB Stick in the Soundfly when using the Sansa you need to remember to pause the Soundfly. The media that was in it will continue to play even though you can't hear it while listening to Sansa.<br /><br />I'm just really happy that I don't have to wear headphones anymore when driving in order to listen to what I want. I don't care for radio anymore. I'm also glad I don't have to burn everything onto discs to listen to car deck- which could not read mp3. This was a perfect, economical solution. Saved me from having to buy a new car deck to enjoy my mp3 media.<br /><br />A word about Satechi and why I'm shaking hands with them. The menu function on the first unit I received was not working properly. I could tell I had a quality item in my hands, liked how it looked, felt and what it was supposed to be able to do but wasn't. So, I hoped something could be done to leave me satisfied. I followed the instructions on the invoice to contact Satechi about the issue. I got an email within an hour informing me that a new unit was being sent out with prepaid postage to return defective unit. I was impressed with their quick response and solution.

0439023521|5.0|`The Hunger Games' is the first book in Suzanne Collins ridiculously popular (and heartbreakingly wonderful) `Hunger Games' trilogy.<br /><br />The first book came out in October 2008 and generated a *lot* of buzz. It helped that Stephenie Meyer and Stephen King provided puffs for the book's cover, and generally ensured that two very different but far-reaching audiences would give the book a go. . . but more than that, film buzz started up pretty much from the get-go. I was aware of the hype, but I also knew that `The Hunger Games' was the first book in a trilogy. . . so I decided to bide my time and wait for all the books to come out and read them back-to-back. The third and final book, `Mockingjay' was released in August of this year. . . but I still waited three months before I started reading.<br /><br />There is a New World Order where the Capitol rules, absolutely. In a bid to quench uprisings and rebellion, the Capitol have made sport out of sacrifice. . . every year they hold The Hunger Games. Twenty-four people from each District (starting at age 12) are randomly selected to enter into a fight to the death - for the amusement and entertainment of Capitol residents. The Games are viewed around the world, camera lapping up the blood and gore and audiences rooting and sponsoring their favourite sacrifices.<br /><br />Two children from each district, one boy and one girl, enter into the ever-changing arena landscape to battle against one another and come out the sole, victorious, survivor. The reaping provides dual purpose - entertainment value and to remind the District's that the Capitol can offer their children up to slaughter without batting an eyelid.<br /><br />This year Katniss Everdeen is one of the Game's offerings. Along with Peeta Mellark, these two represent District 12 - Panem's lowliest, poorest district famous only for coal mining. Katniss enters into the game with the dwindling hope that she will survive and return home to her mother and little sister, Prim. But a risky strategy by Peeta might just turn the game around for them. . . if they spin a tale of being star-crossed lovers, thrown into the Hunger Games only to kill one another, can they win the heart of the crowd and accomplish the impossible? Can they actually win?<br /><br />`The Hunger Games' is summer-blockbuster reading. It's a cross between George Orwell's 1984, Gladiator, Mad Max and John Marsden's `Tomorrow' series. . . in a word: `phenomenal'. I hate to use clich&eacute;s, but `The Hunger Games' is literally `unputdownable'. It's the sort of book that you hole yourself up with in your room, and when someone comes in to tell you that dinner is ready or it's time for you to go to work, you snarl and snap at them and tell them to get the hell out because you just got to a really good part and they're killing your reading-mojo. . . it's that kind of book!<br /><br />There are so many layers to `The Hunger Games'. On the surface it's a damn good yarn - full of tension, action, unrequited love and moral conundrums. . . but if you dig deeper you start to really appreciate how complex Suzanne Collins's universe is.<br /><br />The book acts as a sort of mirror to society. In a time when reality TV rules the box, Collins writes a distorted, dystopian imagining of reality TV in the future - where blood-sport is the new norm. The same way that George Orwell predicted a watchful Big Brother society, Collins forecasts a disturbing new trend in reality television. And a lot of the book's focus (even indirectly) is on the audience who lap up the bloodied television show.<br /><br />I loved reading about the Capitol and its residents. It is with characters like Effie Trinket (one of District 12's `mentors') that Collins takes current notions of `celebrity' to exaggerated and disturbing lengths. I loved reading about the look and dress of Capitol residents - from the stylist who dyed her skin a pea-green shade to the gold eye-tattoos and rampant plastic surgery. There's no doubt that Collin's fictional future dystopia is our current society in a fun-house mirror - embellished and ruined.<br /><br />`The Hunger Games' is a twisted, romantic fare. Peeta and Katniss's `romance' is wonderful and wonderfully complicated. The book is told from Katniss's perspective, so when Peeta starts flirting she (and readers) are never entirely sure if it's a strategy or genuine love. Add into the mix the fact that Peeta and Katniss are going into the Hunger Games arena knowing only one of them can survive. . . and this isn't your typical romance. I've never read such high romantic stakes in a Young Adult book and I loved the fact that the `love story' is just as edge-of-your-seat as the action of fighting to the death. Brilliant!<br /><br />Perhaps my favourite aspect of `The Hunger Games' was the characters and Suzanne Collin's making heroes out of her young protagonists. I love reading YA books where the author doesn't `talk down' to her characters, and therefore audience. Collins has really made a hero of Katniss - she has written her as a tough-as-nails, ass-kicking young woman. And I especially loved that all of the young characters in this book don't rely on adults to `save' them - they have to save themselves because, in fact, the adults are the bad guys. The adults are the Gamemakers and Capitol politicians who insist on throwing these games every year and making a killing example out of these poor kids.<br /><br />Like John Marsden, Suzanne Collins throws her young characters into impossibly awful situations, letting them save themselves and test their own mettle. Brilliant. These are characters that young readers can admire and learn from.<br /><br />I absolutely, unabashedly and whole-heartedly loved the first book in the Hunger Games trilogy. On the one hand I kind of wish I had jumped on the Suzanne Collins band-wagon sooner. . . but at the same time I was totally relieved reading the last page of `The Hunger Games' and knowing that `Catching Fire' and `Mockingjay' were waiting for me on my shelf. I don't know how I could have stood the suspense otherwise.current society in a fun-house mirror - embellished and ruined.    `The Hunger Games' is a twisted, romantic fare.

B0002O06N0|5.0|Have not listened to this album a great deal, not like the others (see review of Attack & Release, The Big Come Up, Magic Potion and Chulahoma).  But it does not disappoint. Good Rock, bluesy - get up and dance music.  I don't think I could dislike any music they put out. Excellent, excellent!   Old rockers will not regret adding Black Keys albums to their collection!  And boys, don't go and go SOLO - you make too good a team!
B001UV4XHY|3.0|This movie reminded me of March of the Penguins.  We watch the trio of kids traipse all around England like the penguins marched around Antarctica in MotP, and the pacing of the movies was eerily similar.  Just as an occasional polar bear-ish siting would happen to liven things up in MotP, there is an occasional villain popping up in this movie to liven things up.  Both movies also lack a driving narrative.  In MotP, the penguins just go back and forth because that's what they do.  Here, the trio look for horacruxes because...well, because...well, because they have to!<br /><br />It was nice to look at, the acting is fine, and I am eager for Part 7.  I'm hoping Part 7 delivers all of the excitement that this movie was missing.
B003NFM3JU|3.0|I was very excited to see this movie on blu-ray 3D, and never saw it in theaters. I have watched and have many other 3D titles. This was the worst 3D experience I have had yet in terms of the picture 3D quality. There was a lot of double vision, making the picture not as crisp. I am not sure it it was my Samsung LN46C750 46-Inch 1080p 3D LCD HDTV or the movie it self. And the movie has a ton of dark or black scenes, which looked bad too, like white cloudy areas on my screen; maybe my TV? I have never noticed this before now though on any other movies. The movie was like I remember the older movies/stories. The story moved slow and not that exciting, I was hopeful they changed it up a bit. But not bad. I was amazed my the detail in the characters in this movie compared to other animated movies, it really looked great! My main issue was the picture quality. POOR. I would be interesting in others experience in the picture quality<br /><br />My equipment:<br />*Samsung LN46C750 46-Inch 1080p 3D LCD HDTV<br />*Samsung BD-C6900 1080p 3D Blu-ray Disc Player<br />*Onkyo HT-S3300 Home Theater System<br /><br />PRICE: I pre-ordered months ago on Amazon for $27.99 and as it was being shipped to me I find the $10 Disney coupon for it. Wal-mart and other stores locally had the same price, but after contacting Amazon they gave me a $10 credit. So all said and done I paid $17.99 w/ free shipping!

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Best hiphop cd of the year. Kanye makes the best beats thats why he is a little bit better than Weezy. This cd is so sick from start to finish even though I heard most of the songs before they came out.
B003ZVJFFM|4.0|The technical wizardry of Robert Zemeckis and crew is on the forefront of this very effective and entertaining film. Jim Carey performs Scrooge and other characters with his usual flamboyance, although not with his usual humor, as humor is not germane to the story. Rather the performances are domintaed by the shockingly stunning and beautiful animation. I viewed the film on blu-ray and I simply don't have the words to effectively describe how good this film is technically. It is surprisingly faithful to the Dicken's original, incorporating some scenes that have to my knowledege not made it into other movie versions. My only criticism of the film regards the scenes involving the Ghost of Christmas Future. The segment is a bit over-long, ultra-harrowing, and for that reason, not appropriate for young children, although the rest of the film is. It is fascinating and ironic that it has taken a state of the art 21st century movie rendition of the book to so accurately capture what Dickens was describing in the 19th century. Special features are adequate, describing the motion-capture technology behind the lustrous animation.
B0042JH05I|2.0|only average, end of carreer concert. too bad for an artist with so many nice receords and shows. buy only if you are a UBER-FAN.
0439023513|3.0|Keep in mind: I absolutely loved the first two books in this series...but I just couldn't manage to get into this one. It was different, is the only way I know to put it. For one, were not in the arena anymore and that added a lot to the other two novels...more than I previoulsy realized...MOckingjay was just totally depressing. I understand a writer has to put their characters through the ringer for a good story, but somehow it just doesn't quite work here. The painted picture even by the last page, is just so morbid and hopeless...I kept wondering if perhaps Katniss should just slit her wrists and have done with it all. Wanted so much to love it, but couldn't.
B003A4IFGY|5.0|It's a good CD if you like past Tom Petty music.  The whole CD is worth listening to, nothing is bad on it.  With that said, some songs are measurably better than others.  I like tracks 3, 4, 5, and 13.  None of the music is hard rock, much of it is easy going almost ballad stuff.  He has a few stories to tell, and a few good lines in the music.  Again, if you like prior Petty albums, you will like this one.
B002HFP0R4|5.0|This is a must have for all Bee Gees Fans and Andy Gibb!!  all I can say is wow!!The songs were all well chosen and even included a few unreleased songs. I really enjoyed the two songs on the disc dedicated to Maurice Gibb \\"Angel of Mercy \\" and \\"The Bridge\\" In which he shared vocals with daughter Samantha who sings like an Angel.  The 60 page tribute booklet filled with photos of the Gibbs and comments from great artists such as Olivia Newton-John,Elton John,Brian Wilson,Taylor Swift,Kenny Rogers and so many more.  This is THE BEST COLLECTION..from one of THE best singer/song writers of all time.  The Bee Gees are Forever!!
B0043KK4N6|5.0|I just bought the CD after leaving the university and I have been listening to it over and over on replay. This soundtrack is very very good. Cher does a good job, but Christina Aguilera's  voice is beyond superb. the beautiful people, somethings got a hold on me, EXPRESS, but im a good girl, show me how you burlesque, tought lover guy what takes his time are such fun hits for this style of music and bound to you is beautiful and touching. this is how soundtracks for other movies should be done. this is an amazing job, and fun, fun album. BIONIC was awesome and so is this. you will enjoy this different genre of music with similarities and her voice so raw and beautiful-like etta james herself said, \\"I have never heard someone who sings so hard and with such a powerful voice...it's like your an old soul.\\" and like celine dion said on tyra banks, \\"christina is the best vocalist I have ever heard-she can really uuuuuuuuuuse her vocals.\\"
B0044XV3QY|2.0|Sorry to all you TEC people, but I buy a movie to be intertained by it.  When I buy a different version, I expect the added content to greatly  add to the original movie.  The \\"Lord of the Rings\\" series is a great   example.  Also, \\"The Kingdom of God\\" is another.  With this movie, I   just LOVED the original.  The expanded version just seems to have a  bunch of stuff thrown in.  Even the school add-in wasn't complete like   it could have been. The new beginning was a waste of footage, time, etc.  You will get just as much of the story by sticking to the original.  I'm just thankful that I didn't pay any more for it.
B001C4CI8A|4.0|These movies are the scariest horror movies of all time. Watching this, the Kingdom, Green Zone, etc the one thing that always jumps out at me is how much poverty and despair there are in this world that Americans are largely shielded from - it blows my mind. Here I'm thinking about getting more hours at work - they are wondering when they are going to be blown to pieces.. sure the movies may heighten that aspect, but for all intents and purposes I think they are closer to the truth than a lie.    Body of Lies itself is a real winner. I'm starting to think Leo Di cannot be a focal character in a movie I won't love - his track record for me is so damn stellar. The movie feels like two movies in one - the first half focus's on the known safe house of Al-Saleem to which I thought was the stronger aspect; everything felt very organic and had a somewhat 'you are there on location' feel. The second half (once they lose the safe house) - the 'orchestrating' of a terrorist group to draw out Al-Saleem felt highly improbable, something more akin to a Bond film - but still with Leo Di at the helm I somehow felt I too could create my own terrorist network out of spamming a Yahoo account, lol...    The romance. Loved it. Superb performances with real chemistry by Leo and \\"Aisha\\". Russell Crowe was about the only thing that felt a bit \\"off\\" in Body of Lies.. It's obvious he tried to fatten up for the role, different hair color, etc - but under all that I still see a Gladiator, lol.. it's not that he wasn't at least partially convincing, it's that as a viewer I don't really want to have to struggle too hard to distance myself from an actor and a role they aren't typically in - so this could be my bias - but if you threw Philip Seymour Hoffman into this role he would have melded right in as opposed to being forced into it. It should be noted -  Mark Strong gave a strong performance;)    All in the all the transfer too was superb..
B003EYVXYG|1.0|I thought Diary of the Dead was good-enough and liked it just fine, but this movie is seriously bad. Why in gods name do people on an island off the coast of Delaware have Irish accents? Also, there are no islands in the ocean off the coast of Delaware, forgivable but still pretty laim. I was really mad at how bad this movie was right after I watched it, I thought to myself \\"okay if it is as good as Diary of the Dead I will be happy\\" zombies rock. But no the Zombies in this movie suck and the love story is stupid. This film went no where and did nothing to add to \\"The Dead\\" series. BOOOO!
0525951652|5.0|It seems there is turmoil about the price of this book on Kindle.  This turmoil is creating an unfair rating on the book itself.  Since I am not a Kindle user, I read the hardcover book.  It is a powerful novel that brought some amazing history to life.  I enjoy rich, complex stories that shed light on history and other cultures.  Using the rating and review process to rant about the price is unfair to the author who worked very hard to produce this excellent book.  If you don't like the price, don't buy it.
0674049160|5.0|\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is undoubtedly one of the most beloved classic novels in history -- it's had countless adaptations, sequels and homages lavished on it over the years. While it's rather stuffily written much of the time, it has a vibrant core of witty dialogue and strong characters that shine like lanterns in the night. And this annotated edition is a good one to have -- sturdy, smooth, and full of descriptions of what's going on.<br /><br />The Bennett family is thrown into an uproar when wealthy Mr. Bingley moves into the neighborhood, and Mrs. Bennett is especially happy when he takes a liking to the eldest Bennett daughter Jane. But her independent sister Lizzie immediately butts heads with wealthy, aloof Mr. Darcy, who scorns the rural village and seems haughty about everything.<br /><br />A flurry of proposals, road trips and friendships happen over the course of the following months, with Lizzie fending off her slimy cousin Mr. Collins, and befriending the flirty, hunky Wickham, who claims to have been wronged by Darcy.<br /><br />But Lizzie is shocked Darcy proposes to her, and reveals what Wickham won't tell her about both of their past lives. And finally things take a scandalous turn when Lizzie's idiotic younger sister Lydia elopes with Wickham, while staying with a friend in Brighton -- and the only one who can set things right is Darcy.<br /><br />Reading \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a bit like watching someone embroider a piece of cloth with subtle, intricate designs. Lots of balls, dances and drawing room banter, interwoven with some of Austen's opinions about haughty aristocrats, marriages of security, entailment, and the whole idea of what an ideal woman has (intellect and strength).<br /><br />Jane Austen writes very much in the style of her literary era -- it's rather formal and stuffy much of the time. But Austen's brilliance as a writer is evident -- she slowly unfolds the plot one act at a time, with several intricate subplots that tie together and play off each other. She also wrote unbelievably sharp-edged dialogue with plenty of witty banter (\\"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine\\"). But Austen also weaves in startlingly romantic moments between them (\\"No one admitted to the privilege of hearing you, can think anything wanting\\").<br /><br />It's hard to imagine a better fictional couple than Lizzie and Darcy, despite their rocky start. Both are witty, smart, and a bit snotty in their own ways, with quick minds and even quicker tongues. Darcy is a selfish, rather haughty man man who gradually becomes warm and kind, while Lizzie is strong, independent, and Darcy's equal in every way. And neither will marry for anything but true love.<br /><br />It also has a solid supporting cast: the painfully practical Charlotte Lucas, slimy clerics, virtuous-looking rakes, sisters ranging from saintly to snobby, and the lovable Mr. Bingley and perpetually optimistic Jane. Lizzie's family also adds plenty of color to the story, like the screechy and hilariously mercurial Mrs. Bennett and the barb-tongued Mr. Bennett (\\"Your mother will never see you again if you do not marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again if you do\\").<br /><br />The annotated edition is definitely a boon to fans of this book. Terminology is explained, period details are explained, and Patricia Meyer Spacks gives extensive details on what the characters' interactions and thoughts mean (although she seems a bit harsh on Lizzie). The book itself is beautiful -- wide and smooth pages, strong binding, clear print, and lots of relevant pictures inserted (places Austen went, people she knew, and even a quilt she helped make).<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is the ultimate Jane Austen novel -- a powerful and romantic story about two people who grow and change because of love.

B002ZG999U|4.0|Let's face it: THE EXPENDABLES is not a great film.  It'll never win an award, never be regarded as a classic.  Nor should it be.  THE EXPENDABLES is an in-your-face action film, an homage to the great films of the 80s and early 90s starring Sly Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgren, Jean-Claude Van Damme, Stephen Segal, and other butt-kickers.  If you like those films, you'll like this one; if you don't like those films, then stay away.<br /><br />As a trip down memory lane, as a rock-em-sock-em-one-liner extravaganza, THE EXPENDABLES succeeds admirably.  The plot is predictably lame: a bunch of mercenaries decide to take on a dictatorship, especially after the group's leader meets the dictator's beautiful, feisty (and, naturally, anti-daddy) daughter.  Things become a little more complicated when it's discovered that the dictator is a CIA stooge, but that won't stop our tough guys.  They can withstand bullets, bombs, fire, the elements--they're the Expendables!<br /><br />And that's what you get.  Take it or leave it.  Sly Stallone is in fine form, believe it or not.  Jason Statham (a genuinely good actor when he isn't kicking butt and not taking names) adds a little weight as Sly's second-in-command.  Others along for the ride: Mickey Rourke, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crewes, Randy Couture (who should NOT act, even in a so-bad-it's-good movie like this), Eric Roberts, and Steve Austin.  Stallone and Statham get the most screen time, which is good because they're arguably the most talented actors here (and certainly the most fleshed-out characters).  Would've liked to have seen more of Rourke (he's got more talent in one finger than most of this cast combined), but he has better things to do these days.<br /><br />But you don't care about acting or plot.  You want action-action-action, and a few one-liners, and some cool as hell knife tossing.  And you got it, baby.  THE EXPENDABLES delivers what you want in your action movie--no more, no less.<br /><br />*MINOR SPOILER ALERT AHEAD (though I'm wondering how anyone could not know about it by now.)<br /><br />You may be wondering about the scene between Stallone, Bruce Willis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.  Well.  It's short, so don't be disappointed.  It's predictable.  It's trite.  But, yes, it's totally amazing.  Having our three great action icons onscreen at the same time (or, at least, in the same scene)...it's worth the rental price alone.POILER ALERT AHEAD (though I'm wondering how anyone could not know about it by now.)

B00402FGE4|4.0|I was big a fan of the two previous Stargates. After their demise I was thrilled to find out there was going to be a new entree in the series. At first I was disappointed and considered not watching after the first few episodes. I'm glad I stuck with it because it got better as the season went on. As others mentioned it does have a bit of a soap opera quality to it but it's minimum (and even less so in Season 2), but I disagree with others who said there was no hard core SciFi or fighting for survival. There's also the overarching theme of the mystery of Destiny and it's mission as well as various mysterious aliens. Overall I give this a 4, but now half way through Season 2 I will definitely be giving Season 2 a 5. It doesn't rank as high on my list as Eureka, but it's a good show.
0307454541|1.0|This book is terrible.  Stilted dialogue, and an absolute failure to create characters who are anything more than vehicles for the plot.<br /><br />Example: girl has 5-ish tattoos.  Goes to tattoo parlor.  Tattoo artist asks, \\"you already have some tattoos.  Are you sure you want another?\\" Seriously.<br /><br />Further, the sexism in this book sucks.  The girl is autistic, which apparently renders her able to function in the author-created man's world. All the non-autistic females are shadow characters, and not involved in the goings-on, except to be bitchy and talk a lot.<br /><br />In short: this author creates interesting plots, but sucks at understanding subcultures, females, and character definition.

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Oh how dimwitted yet incredibly intelligent Ron can be at times, as the above statement shows. He understands that the war that Voldomort has waged isn't just about Harry. Yes, he is a huge factor; but not the whole reason. And this film really starts to show us just how big this \\"war\\" has become. Reaching so far as to take over the \\"secure\\" and \\"powerful\\" Ministry of Magic, and even taking over the sacred halls of Hogwarts itself.    But, Harry is still a large part of the war. He is the figure that the good stand behind now that the thought to be immortal Dumbledore is no more.  And with that knowledge, so this film begins. Dumbledore is dead, and Harry is left clueless as to what he is to do with the fragments of knowledge that were left to him. He knows he must destroy the remaining Horocruxes; magical items housing split pieces of Voldomorts soul, keeping him immortal. But what are these items, how do you destroy them, and most importantly how do you find them. This is the main focus of Part 1. After realizing that he is not safe anywhere he goes, Harry with his trusted friends Ron and Hermione go on the run to find these remaining objects and learn how to destroy them.    Deathly Hallows is one of the most well structured films of the series to date. Many things that the amazing J.K. Rowling wrote in the novel would have weighed the film version down and made it feel disjointed, but Steve Kloves has done a magical job at finding the root story, and side stories that are relevant to this. He has also given us one of the most emotional scripts, delivered with true and powerful performances by all; particularly by our core three. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have truly become amazing actors/actresses. So many scenes in this film are very depressing and filled with tension and all three deliver. Small additions also make the film all that much more amazing. The dance that Harry and Hermione share after Ron abandons the cause, is truly heart felt and sweet.    But the action and set design are also astounding. The opening chase sequence with the multiple Harry's being chased by the death eaters through the skies and streets of London was amazing and intense. And the infiltration of the Ministry to steal one of the horocruxes is ingenious and while funny, very intense as well, and also gives us the chance to once again see the amazing Imelda Staunton as the ever nasty Dolores Umbridge. The chase between the snatchers and the trio near the end of the film is also very intense.     Giving props to Daniel, Emma and Ron is commendable but the supporting cast is also amazing. Ray Fiennes as Voldomort is as always creepy and nasty as Voldomort. And Alan Rickman; although underused; steals every scene his character Severus Snape is in. But I must say that the stand out in this film to me was Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange who played the role with such cunning and murderous venom that she stole each and every scene she was in. Her torturing of Hermione was a terrifying scene to hear and behold.     Death is also a major theme in this film, we loose several loved characters and many people are scene dead or worse in the film, so to all those thinking of taking their little kids, I'd say no. The film is very dark and morbid, and has a very forboding sense of dread hanging over it. This is not Chamber of Secrets or even Order of the Phoenix.     I was immensely satisfied with this film, even if it was incomplete, but it is a step in the right direction. I have been, unlike some, very impressed with the last few films, enjoying the more mature and tense filled films.   With Half Blood Prince being my favorite to date, even better in my opinion than this one. So if your wanting to see a truly gripping film than go see Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Pt. 1.
B001152TL6|5.0|Lost Highway is not that bad. It's one of the most underrated Lynch movies.     It's got all you could want from Lynch: surreal stuff, unexplained situations, scary nightmares and all that. If you like Lynch's world, it's definitely worth a look and you could see this one many times like Mulholland Dr, trying to understand what it means.
B001YV502C|1.0|I never thought I'd have to use Iron Maiden song lyrics as a title for my review, but as it turns out, you never really should say never.<br /><br />And another warning. Prepare to see a LOT of uses of the word \\"Somehow\\" in this review, because this movie is so full of unrealistic coincidences (especially for a sci-fi movie) that it annoys the hell out of me.<br /><br />Basically the last person on earth has died. Somehow this guy is idolized since there has somehow been a mass infertility rate for 18 years. Somehow he has a lot of fans. Somehow one of his \\"fans\\" killed him. We find this out in the beginning where numerous are gathered in a convenience store which somehow gets blown up (and we don't know how someone managed to somehow get a bomb in there.(<br /><br />Theo, a businessman who we don't know much about, was married to a beautiful wife played by Julianne Moore who is the head of a terrorist group somehow named \\"The Fishes\\". I did not make that up. Of all names for a terrorist group, she chose the name \\"Fishes\\". Society has collapsed in various parts of the world and, I'm about to use the dreaded \\"S\\" word again- somehow, London is the only place that soldiers on. Somehow, in the wake of all this infertility, a woman has miraculously gotten pregnant for unknown reasons. Thus ensues a ridiculously unrealistic story that almost never takes off.<br /><br />There, I've summed up the film, I can stop using the word \\"somehow\\" for a while.<br /><br />This film is well shot, I'll tell you that. It is interesting to look at, with its gloomy and depressing look that plays a character. That's really all I know I can say about this film that isn't negative. This film is just flat out awful. How it manages to get all these rave reviews baffles me. It's even in the IMDb Top 250, FFS. There's a good amount of cameos from good actors, yet they get killed off 5 minutes into their screentime to save money. There are tonnes of unrealistic coincidences that happen. I know it's a science fiction movie, but gimme a break.<br /><br />Like I said the movie is visually pretty, and makes good use of the blue hue (so if you put on a pair of 3D glasses and close your left eye, no you won't get anything). It's hard to believe people praise this pretentious pap.reak.

You may be a person who cannot stand Kanye the man but if you don't like his music than you need to have your ears checked. He consistantly delivers amazing music time and time again and this album may just be the best one yet. I'm sure there will be many more to come as he has proven to stand as a hip hop heavy wieght. Great Great Great Album!

B001UV4XHY|5.0|Part I of the Deathly Hallows is faithful to the book for the most part.  Although a few things were cut out (such as the evil werewolf Greyback with the Snatchers or cutting out the Harry/Lupin fight in favor of a cute tent dancing scene with Hermione) the overall spirit of the film was faithful to the book.<br /><br />Director David Yates I feel did not make a great film with Order of the Phoenix but clearly redeemed himself in my eyes with this film.<br /><br />The film felt rushed at first. In the book there was more build-up with Uncle Vernon.  On the other hand, Harry's contemplation of the little stairway closet he used to live in, you can almost hear him say \\"Wow, I've come a long way.\\"<br /><br />And indeed he has.  He wants no one to be hurt or injured and would rather go off on his trek on his own.  But Ron and Hermione will have none of it. and go Disapparating all over the English countryside with the Death Eaters hot on his tail.<br /><br />Several scenes they got right:  Ron's anger and jealousy with Harry and Hermione.  The Patronus doe to the lake where the sword of Gryffindor is laid.  The snake attack at Bagshot's place.<br /><br />And most amazingly, the great animation of the Three Brothers tale, as told by Hermione (and interrupted by Ron a couple times)!<br /><br />Nitpicking Follows!<br /><br />Several things I would have liked to have seen:  More of the elf Kreecher and his explanation of Regulus Black's switching of the Horcrux at the lake introduced in the previous film.  And in the book, Harry's disguised self at the Ministry of Magic enabled him to free many people from the dungeons of the Ministry but that didn't happen here.  And more of the radio -- there was a lot more going on with the radio broadcasts {Potter Watch}, like a Radio Free Wizard or something!<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /><br />I can see a person not having read the book might have some trouble with parts of the screenplay.  Reading the book clearly helps in filling in the gaps.  The snappy dialogue and the deep emotional investment by the audience is wrenching.  But the occasional humor (the tent scene) was cute.  And the soundtrack by the London Symphony Orchestra was superb.<br /><br />It's going to be a long wait to this summer!nt by the audience is wrenching.

B003B02NLK|5.0|After reading the extremely funny and moving sample chapter of this book I paid real money to download this to my kindle.  Other reviewers have done justice to the strengths of this book.  The best thing that can said about Craig is that he must be a fundamentally decent bloke because he still gets on with his exes (of which there are many).  Craig, please write more.  You're very good at it.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|So as a guy its normally hard to ride around playing chick rappers. This cd makes it easy to do. Niki's flow and lyrics are just amazing. The production is great and she represents Young money/ Cash money very strong. She has a nice balance of rapping and singing just like Drake did on his debut album. Niki can hang with the hip hop heavy wights on all her features and now proves she can do the same on her own as a solo artist. Great album and I can't say im supprised that she delivered the goods. She is a amazing talent and this is a classic album.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Outstanding movie with great deleted scenes put in the movie and more great unfinished scenes that go great with the plot of the movie. A plot that was simple but put on screen in a masterful way! I love the scene when the scientists get on their Avatars to take on Parker and the Mercenaries! (second cd)! I was mad they didn't put it in the movie cause is great!

B0044KU7KU|5.0|I have been following MCR from almost the time their first CD came out, and I must say, this has to be one of the best albums I have heard from them! But then again, for me they cannot disappoint! Killjoys Make Some Noise and buy this album!
B002ZG980U|5.0|Shambhala Buddhist teacher Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche defined dharma art as genuine art that tells the truth, in contrast to Buddhist art which depicts some aspect of Buddhism. To him Shakespeare, William Blake and Mozart were great dharma artists. Their art came from a 'Square One' aspect of mind and had the qualtiy of taking the reader, viewer or listener 'back to Square One'. Even though the movie \\"Inception \\" is science fiction and not literally true in the sense of being possible yet it points to some important aspects of life...there is dream like quality to our existence yet, at the same time, it is important to live your life so that you can die without regrets. See any book on Atisha's Absolute and Relative Bodhicitta Slogans. See also CTR's \\"True Perception:the path of dharma art\\". There is also the Buddhist practice of Dream Yoga where one can direct one's own dreams though not share them. And the finesse it takes to 'plant an idea' in someone else's mind is also beautifully demonstrated. 'Positive emotions trump negative'...another gem that rings true.
0812973992|5.0|I read the negative reviews for this book first, and noticed that many of the readers got bogged down at a certain point and stopped reading. So why am I calling this \\"a glorious book\\"? Because I did something I almost never do---I went back to it after several weeks, partly due to my husband's urgings \\"it really does all come together\\" and partly due to that fact that I really knew it was extremely well written. All I can say is, if you hit that wall about a third of the way through, keep going! It doesn't last long, and you'll be wonderfully rewarded.   I found the story unique, the tightrope walk between the Twin Towers a clever device, and wonderful unforgetable characters. Claire's grief was almost too painful to read. And, unlike so many books, it had a satisfying, forgiving ending. Some of the social commentary reminded me of the best of Tom Wolfe, that is, Tom Wolfe with a heart.

B004498KPU|5.0|I have and always will be a true die hard fan of Michael Jackson. On June 25th, 2009, I can honestly say i've never really been depressed over the death of a celebrity, but his death effected me. I don't just love Michael as artist, but I loved him for his personality. He was a true humanatrian and very humble person. He cared about his family, friends, the planet earth, and last but not least, his loving fans. I was very eagerly excited that he was going to tour in 2009 and eventually tour in the United States. Unforunatley, my dream of seeing him live was crushed but I am glad he in a better place now.     Well, I will get to the review of this DVD box set. I am glad they decided to release all of his music videos all in one set. They are all released with restored color and remastering sound. I am proud to see they finally released the \\"One More Chance\\" video, which Michael was working on in 2003. Also I see they have included the hard to find \\"She's Out Of My Life\\", which you can see Michael at a very young age in 1980 singing with such passion. Of course, you get all of the classic videos, \\"Billie Jean\\", \\"Beat It\\", \\"Bad\\", \\"Scream\\", \\"Remember The Time\\", \\"Smooth Criminal\\", and need do I mention \\"Thriller\\", and many many more of his classic videos. Also including three videos with \\"The Jacksons\\". The duet video \\"Say Say Say\\" with Paul McCartney and the duet with his three nephews \\"3T\\" for the video \\"Why\\".    There's just a few things that bothered me with the release of this DVD. The first thing is, in which I know alot of fans are mad because of this but they released the short version of \\"Ghosts\\". They released the 4 mintue video instead of the 38 minute video. If they could of included the long versions of \\"Bad\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"You Rock My World\\" & \\"Smooth Criminal\\", they could of included the full 38 minute video clip of \\"Ghosts. The 2nd thing is that they are missing a couple of videos. Where is the rarley seen video of \\"Human Nature\\"? Also, if they included both videos for \\"They Don't Care About Us\\", why didn't they include both videos for \\"Who Is It?\\". The second video is for \\"Who Is It?\\" is a video of all of Michael's video shown together in diffirent clips. An the 3rd thing is why did they release the remix version of \\"Blood On The Dance Floor\\"?, they should of just included the original version of the song just like all the rest of his videos.    Besides for that, this is a great release for Michael Jackson. If your a die hard fan, new fan, or a seldom fan, I would recommend this box set to you to see the King Of Pop at his best. I am also eagerly excited for the new album next month, titled \\"Michael\\". Even though the songs are being released without his blessings of perfection, we get something new & fresh. The album will no where be in the standards of \\"Off The Wall\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Bad\\", & \\"Dangerous\\", but i'm sure it will be great!     Michael, we miss you and love you! Long Live the King Of Pop!
0525951652|3.0|Ken Follet has fallen a bit with Fall of Giants. I've read all of his books and he has slowly but steadily gone from a fine writer of historical fiction ( Eye of The Needle was excellent ) to one who seems to have more concern with romance/sex than the history surrounding the tale. It's a so so read and at 1,000 pages, you likely want something better than so so. By the way, this book is available in print, Disc and the PLAYAWAY digital player, which I do NOT RECCOMEND. It is fraught with problems. I had to go through 2 players to get through the book. The first player simply died with a fresh battery. Calls to the mfr and to my library gave no help. The 2nd player died and/or skipped at times, and then miraculously restarted. Also, it is difficult to navigate around on this technology. You cannot go back to a specific place if you so desire-you must go to a chapter's beginning and with long chapters, that is a pain.
B0042RUMG4|5.0|This album is so monumental, the production, guest rappers, and Kanye himself are awesome on this album. I think this might be his best album.

B0049D1TCM|4.0|Nicki is fire. She is arguably the biggest, newest hip-hop act to come to the scene in recent years, and she had much to prove on her major debut album. Nicki is shining bright, and all eyes are on her. No matter why you love or respect her, Nicki Minaj is one of the brighest artists of the year, if not the one. She manages to deliver on her debut album, but only as far as she can go by herself.     The songs are decent, some better than others, the lyrics are phenomenal, with some being poetic, creative, shamelessly flamboyant, all a known trademark of Ms. Minaj's. Nicki Minaj is at her best in this album, showing so many different faces of her character, you will know Onika Maraja fter listening to it completely.     The biggest problem Pink Friday has to deal with is that it does not work well as an album. There is no theme to hold the album together. The album doesn't flow smoothly, with the serious, reflecting song \\"Moment 4 Life\\" crashing with the silliness of \\"Check it Out\\". There is a variety of producers and writers on this album, which can either be a blessing or a mistake. There is not a sound uniting the album into one piece of work.     Songs alone work very well, some being the best we've seen from Nicki to date, with \\"Roman's Revenge\\" being classic Nicki, and \\"Dear Old Nicki\\" showing us an honest, emotional side of her we have but only once or twice seen before. However, the songs, as an album, a unified body of work, do not stand the weight.      That isn't to say Nicki is not on point; rapping exceptional lyrics, balancing her various personas, and singing (surprisingly well), on a majority of the tracks. She shines in every single track, giving her all, and not trying to prove anything to anybody, but herself. This is HER album, and after a full listen, she proves it. For a star of her magnitude and litte experience, Pink Friday is something to be proud of.     A bit more guidance and dedication might have made Pink Friday into the universal hip-hop classic it should have been, but then again, who always succeeds the first time? This album is sure to please all fans and haters alike, just by being released. Nicki Minaj has the talent and determination to still make a hip-hop classic, and with time, it is inevitable.
0143038419|5.0|This book came to me just at the most right time in my life. Elizabeth Gilbert is witty and humourous, and she has such deep insights about life and her journey towards spiritual wisdom (as I call it) wows me too.     I love this book, I really do.
B003G94BZC|5.0|Received the DVD set last week, and oh my goodness! I never quite got how good this series is, until the end of Series 5.(aka Season 5, although not really) My whole family is now watching episode after episode, it's really that good.  I'm also going to show them \\"Blink\\" from Series 3 and \\"Silence in the Library/Forest of the Dead\\" from Series 4 before we all view \\"The Time of Angels/Flesh and Stone\\"(Series 5) To me, having both the angels and River Song as pre-requisite viewing really brings much more impact when watching these two episodes in Series 5.    My kids and I have watched all 13 episodes twice now. And what a treat it is to go back and watch episode 1 after episode 13. It really brings it full circle. I didn't think an epic ending was possible after Series 4 (and the specials), but the two-parter Series 5 ending was shocking, and left me teary-eyed, multiple times. I'm really excited and ready to watch the 2010 Christmas special - and love the trailer that was released this last week.    Well, I'm off to order a Roku box now. I'll be getting everything else streaming after that...
B003T0G9XU|4.0|Keeping it short and sweet.    Not as strong as the other books in the adventures of Tiffany and the Feegles (and definitely not the best Discworld novel) but still good enough to make you look like a mental patient when you laugh out loud on the subway.    A bit more in depth, the subject matter is a bit more mature here and Terry does a masterful job with his patented one-two combination of hilarity mixed with sobering insight.    If you love Discworld (and you should) you won't care for reviews and have probably read this book already. For those just starting out, I'd recommend going to the origins with Light Fantastic and making your way form there. Its dozens of books, but you'll get a six-pack by the time you're done and have a permanent grin that would make the Joker nervous.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|First of all this soundtrack is the meat of the musical  \\"Burlesque\\",as the story itself is rather light.The opening song,\\"Somethings got a hold on me\\",by Christina Aguilera is tough,strong and growling! At times I feel Miss Aguilera has a great instrument,but the feeling her vocal registers registers-is  a bit cold. I prefer the Etta James original,but she does an earnest and powerful performance!<br />The \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\" number by Legend Cher is a colorful seductive pan- European number that has flavors of her original \\"Bang Bang\\" meeting \\"Cabaret\\".Her smokey contralto is great for this song.<br />Christina Aguilera shines on the Mae West chestnut,I like a guy who takes his time\\".It's Betty Boop with a real voice.She is so good in this genre.<br />It is beautifully sung,campy and sexy all in one.<br />Crowning moment is \\"You haven't seen the Last of me\\" by Dianne Warren.She steals the show with her raw emotion,a paean to invisible and enduring passion for  \\"The show will go on\\".Cher is amazing on this ballad.<br />It's a shame Cher has but two offerings,but they are worth the price of the CD alone.<br />Christina Aguileras' \\"Bound to you\\",and \\"I am a good girl are the type of songs her terrific instrument shines with.<br />The disco like  finale (two cuts, Beautiful People\\",\\"Show me how you Burlesque\\", are throw-away compared to the stronger efforts here but necessary for the mood of the \\"Burlesque Club,energetic modern and playful. People that love \\"Glee\\" should love this CD. I really enjoy it.It's fun.

B0049D1TCM|5.0|I have had this album for little over a week and that is how I am basing this review. First off I want to mention that I am 29yrs of age and have listened to rap since 92-93. So I did not grow up with the so called classics so I will not judge this cd as other reviewers have comparing to groups and rappers from 10-20years ago.    I feel that this debut album from Nicki Minaj is just what I expected. It has the perfect Young Money beats and flows. The way she rhymes is amazing. She flows with a style lacking in the female rap community. I have been wanting a good female rapper too come around and Nicki fulfills that for me and more. Another reviewer compared Nicki to Ke$ha which to me is just ignorant and makes me think they have not listened to the album or they can't follow her flows. Some of the lyrics remind me of Weezy and Drake in a female body.     \\"Also another reviewer mentioned something about her not carrying the album and how she seemed lost along with Kayne. On \\"Blazin\\" Kayne kills it. They need to stop and listen to the lyrics, timing, and placement of every bar instead of wishing for the classics.    If your unsure about this album find someone that has it or a site that let's you listen to the songs. Listen to \\"Moment 4 Life\\" & \\"Blazin\\", after that I will bet you will be a believer and will purchase it.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|As always, I must start my latest HARRY POTTER review by stating that I have never read any of the books and thus cannot weigh in on their faithfulness.  I enjoy the films, but have never enjoyed them so much that I want to read the books.  I've been okay with the every year or two 2.5 hour dose of Harry and his friends.    DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1 is the first half of the final chapter in the saga (as virtually anyone who draws breath knows already).  And as the first 6 films can be said to be a build-up to the final chapter, this first part of that final chapter is a great deal of build-up with relatively little payoff. At least, from a pure plot perspective, not a lot fills up the 2.5 hours this time.    But if you're interested in the relationships, particularly between Harry, Ron & Hermoine, this is a very satisfying chapter.  In fact, much of the film focuses almost exclusively on these three friends.  Hogwarts is not glimpsed at all, and many of the recurring characters we've grown to know over the course of the series are scarcely seen (Snape, for example, appears in only one scene) or missing altogether (no Maggie Smith at all).   The movie has a chilled, insular feeling to it.    If you are unfamiliar with the basic story and plot of HARRY POTTER...I'm sorry, but I am not the best person to give you that kind of background.  Presumably, if you're interested in this film, you've got a familiarity with the story that has come before.  If not, you need to go back to the very first film and start there.  It would be a heck of a ride.    In THE DEATHLY HALLOWS, we see that the world of magic is descending into a frightening political mess.  The Ministry of Magic is turning into a fascist state, and \\"good\\" wizards and witches the world over are in hiding and being hunted down.  It's a dangerous time for all.  And we also know that the evil Lord Voldemort is preparing to confront Harry and then move on to dominion over all.  Times are bleak, and the film is literally dark throughout.  In the early going, there are some \\"funny\\" moments (one in particular features all of Harry's friends drinking a potion to make them look like him...there are some priceless reactions), but for the most part, the film is grim.  Eventually, Harry and his two closest friends literally go into hiding from the rest of the world...traveling through desolate landscapes in search of a way to destroy a Horcrux (a talisman that holds, I think, a portion of the soul of Voldemort).  They also seek more Horcrux's...and other stuff too.  I'm unclear on some of this, because honestly, the details of what all Harry and his buddies are trying to accomplish seem somewhat vague to me.  I just kind of take their word for it.    So as they run around the forest, or around lakes or other landscapes that look terribly windblown, these three face their own first truly adult arguments, hurt feelings, etc.  As you may know, Ron loves Hermoine.  Hermoine feels the same way, but hasn't worn those feelings on her sleeve...so when she and Harry appear to grow closer...Ron feels alienated.  He's never been the bright one or the magically adept one in his group; now he feels totally useless, resentful and hurt.  It's perhaps too simplistic to say they've got a love triangle going...their feelings are a bit more complicated than that, given all the external stress they're dealing with as well.  In these scenes, which are infused with the sadness of friendships that are losing their childlike innocence, the three young actors (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson & Rupert Grint) do some of their best work ever.  This must come, at least partially, from the fact that these three kids have grown up together on the set of these movies.  They have an ease together that they never achieve when onscreen with other performers.  Many of the scenes have relatively little in the way of special effects going on.  It's just two or three kids, sitting in a tent, or in the woods, having whispered conversations.    Depending on how much you enjoy this series for the character development of Harry, Ron & Hermoine will determine how much you enjoy DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1.    If I make the movie sound small and contained, there are some BIG scenes that take place in the wonderfully rendered Ministry of Magic that nicely remind us that money is no object when it comes to these films.  The movie isn't skimping...the story just seems to be drawing in a deep, slow breath in preparation for all hell breaking loose.    I look forward to the final movie.  DEATHLY HALLOWS PT. 1 did a great job in building that anticipation (and contains a great final moment that practically makes you cry out at how badly you're left hanging).  It's not the greatest movie in the series (it's tough to say which film IS the greatest, but I might lean towards GOBLET OF FIRE, with it's wonderful mix of the grand, the comical and the scary), but for fans, it is essential and rewarding viewing.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|After the bleak minimalism that was \\"808s And Heartbreaks\\", Kanye west returns with a grandiose opus in his 5th studio album, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\". With a lot of attention on his person, thanks to his utterances and antics, which have caught the attention of even two US presidents, expectation was high for this CD.<br /><br />Thankfully, West raises the bar even higher with this CD traipsing through Hip Hop, Rock, and even Electronica. The guest list is just as impressive; Bon Iver, KiD CuDi, Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj, John Legend, Elton John, Fergie, it seems everyone but Michael Jackson is here. And the music is just as rich and eclectic, from the opening \\"Dark Fantasy\\" with its choir (and name checking Celine Dion and the Kings Of Leon hit \\"Sex On Fire\\"), the skeletal clap/chant-filled \\"Power\\", to the 9 minute \\"Runaway\\" (with a psychedelic 3 minute piano/electric guitar coda coming in just when you think it's all over).<br /><br />\\"All Of The Lights\\" with skittery beats and layered vocals is almost operatic in feel, perfect for the drama it narrates (coming home to find his girl with another guy), while \\"Lost In The World\\" is a poignant piece which samples Bon Iver's \\"Woods\\" and features some autotune, perfectly accentuating the bleak mood. \\"Blame Game\\" features John Legend, as well as twinkling keys, cello, and bursts of percussion. A dark fantasy it might be, but beautiful!

B0043KK4N6|4.0|The \\"Burlesque\\" soundtrack comprises just 10 tracks featuring Christina Aguilera on 8 and Cher on 2. The tracks, particularly the Aguilera tracks, are retro Soul/Blues, much like her \\"Back To Basics\\" album.<br /><br />\\"Something's Got A Hold Of Me' is an Etta James cover featuring Aquilera. The horn-peppered camp cabaret Pop \\"But I Am A Good Girl' is cartoon-ish (\\"The dress is Chanel, the shoes YSL, the bag is Dior, agent provocateur\\" she coos), while \\"Guy What Takes His Time\\" sounds very Marylin Monroe. \\"Express\\" is a fiery skeletal song with buzzing guitars, the most modern sounding song here along with the galloping \\"The Beautiful People\\" (a Marilyn Manson cover).\\"Bound To You\\" is a lush piano ballad on which she really shines with her restrained delivery.<br /><br />The Cher songs are my favourites; \\"Welcome To Burlesque\\" (an enchanting Tango), and the Dianne Warren-penned power ballad \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\" which is surprisingly good (as Warren seems to have fallen into a dull rut lately). Short and sweet!
B0000042MY|5.0|Love this soundtrack.  Worth every penny.  Make sure you listen to it on a good sound system to make sure you get the full effect.
B00012QM8G|5.0|This movie was very entertaining \\"Schindler's List.\\" This movie takes place back during WWII in Poland, with a German who was part of the Nazi party. This man went from being in the war to being a savior for the Jews. Liam Neeson who is the star character for Oskar Schindler, uses the slave labor during the war to get a lot of money. He is seen in this movie as a semi-hero who also had flaws of womanizing, greed, alcoholism, and personal dominate. He was looked at the person who was in the war to make only money to get rich and the thought of having Jews and Nazi's would be in his way for success. However, he risks his life in the movie to save the Jewish people. With this being said his change within the film to help the Jews was remarkable. He gave up his wealth and to play the Nazi's for his own benefit. He wanted to help the Jews from the Nazi anti-Semitism and harsh cruelty. In the end he saves over 1000 Jews. This movie relates to the actual Holocaust on modern Jews and also affects those who are not Jewish. The Holocaust was a very sad and detrimental part of history. This movie also displayed the human cruelty of the Nazi camps where Jews were used as targets for example, the lives of twenty or plus people would be taken for one man's actions. That was said to see during this movie what the Jewish people had to go through during the Holocaust. This event in human history during the 20th century of Europe was a horrible time. My impression of this man was that if he could save one live he would try to save all lives for the Jewish people. The Nazi's were known to be evil and cruel people who wanted nothing but the satisfaction to see the Jewish people die. I found myself so moved and upset at the same time that the Jews had to go through this harsh and terrible period in History.
B003YNFYCO|4.0|On the positive side, the RED collection is a great set and they did use the recent remastered tracks for the collection, so it sounds better than ever here. On the negative side: in the days of vinyl, RED needed to be two LPs, but this collection easily would have fit on one CD, so selling it spread over two discs is strictly a profit move on the part of the record company. Either add tracks and make it worth being on 2 CDs or condense it to one disc and sell it for what its worth. It just seems like a bad money grab and sours the value of this set. If you don't want to buy the Beatles albums, RED (and its counterpart BLUE) are great discs to get, but if you plan to get all of the albums there is really no reason to own these.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi is one of the best movies that I have seen so far. The movie Gandhi begins with the leader Mahatma Gandhi who was a leader against non-violence and also against the British during the 20th Century. Gandhi had challenges for he was seen as being a colored man and he then began to start a resistance for non-violence in South Africa and wanted to have rights for all those who were Indian living there. Gandhi was humiliated and beaten many times however; this did not stop him until Indians were granted their rights within South Africa. Gandhi then leaves South Africa after the Indians was granted their rights back in South Africa. Once Gandhi returned home to India he was known as a hero. Gandhi at that point was not done he still was against the British. Gandhi then rounds up Indian Muslims to come help him resist against the British and when they went against the British many of them died. Gandhi then went back to jail, subsequently, jail would not stop Gandhi again from standing up for what he believed which was non-violence for all. Gandhi got ill when he sacrificed eating but it paid off in the end with the British gave freedom and independence was granted from Britain to India. Unfortunately, Gandhi died in 1948 when he was rebelled against for his cause of wanting peace.  This movie is very powerful and showed that with dedication, faith, and belief if you stand by what you believe in anything is possible. This movie also teaches us non-violence and compassion to have peace with one another.   Gandhi relates to the World Religions because he was able to unify the Hindus and Muslims of India to come together. He also describes a valuable line, \\"I am Muslim, Hindu, Christian, and also a Jew,\\" This simplifies that we all are one and that we all love our God in our own way and religion. Gandhi lead by example that world peace is possible with all religions. I recommend everyone to watch this movie.

His voice is beautiful as always, but the song selection left me cold.  Do not get me wrong, I will have his next album on pre-order the day it is announced.  He is one of the most relaxing voices recording today.

0375842209|5.0|I've read 35 books this year. I've enjoyed many of them. I've reviewed none of them on amazon. Until this one. And my review will be more praise than anything. This was the BEST book, hands down, that I read this year. The story of Liesel Meminger is spell-binding, heart breaking, heart warming, honest, and addicting. I was reluctant to read this book as Holocaust Literature usually makes me upset. For some reason I read this book. And I am so glad that I did. I recommend this book whole-heartedly, to young adults and adults. I've added this one to my \\"favorites\\" shelf in my book case.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|I would like to say that who ever did the movie promoting for this in the u.s. should be shot.... but that would be rude. This is easily one of those films that I will watch over and over again. It was a film experience. I am officially in love with the director/score composer. I consider myself a huge movie buff with a wide variety of taste. Lately, I have found myself being bored with the majority of the movies i see. At no time in this movie did my mind have the chance to wander fast enough to figure out what would happen next. I was engaged in every scene. I felt every emotion under the sun while watching this film.

B002ZG99TA|4.0|When human error leads to the spectacle of a fully powered, unmanned freight train carrying toxic materials at over 70 mph into a heavily populated area, a veteran railroader (Denzel Washington) and a rookie (Chris Pine) must work together to bring it to a halt while the nation watches on cable television.    I've been waiting for a really good runaway train movie since...well, \\"Runaway Train,\\" and it's finally here.  Director Tony Scott lets nothing stand in the way of the action, yet still manages to present characters we care about and an intelligent story (screenwriter Mark Bomback) that clearly explains the factors that led to the disaster and the steps taken to rectify it.  The result is an efficient, thrilling action picture that is easy to recommend.
B0041T52S6|5.0|If you're scratching your dome at how funky weird SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD is going down, it's only that the flick is staying true to the offbeat tone and manga sensibilities of Bryan Lee O'Malley's graphic novels. Truthfully, it took me a bit of time to acclimate to the low-keyed Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim because he certainly wasn't whom I pictured when it came to casting (I thought it'd be someone more exuberant). But once I did, I hunkered down and soaked in the film's singular flavor. To say that this film oozes the quirk is like saying that Ramona Flowers has boyfriend issues.<br /><br />Scott Pilgrim inhabits a mysterious land called Toronto, Canada. There, Scott spends his time being 22 years old, slacking off, and playing bass guitar for the grunge garage band, Sex Bob-omb. He's currently dating a 17-year-old high schooler named Knives Chau, but it's a tepid, platonic romance and destined to fizzle. Scott Pilgrim soon enough meets the girl of his dreams, and that is literally. Her name is Ramona Flowers and she runs the gamut of interesting alternative hair dyes. Ramona is American and a courier and she makes regular use of the sub-space highway (so she's very dependable and rapid in her gig). Scott is smitten, stalks her a little bit, orders a package just so that Ramona would deliver it to his crib. He pesters her until she agrees to hang out. This is what's known in Toronto as \\"courtship.\\"<br /><br />Love blossoms. Or, anyway, something blossoms. But Ramona discloses a caveat to Scott. For them to date, Scott would have to defeat Ramona's seven evil ex-boyfriends (er, seven evil exes; it's a thing). Love hurts, again literally. As Ramona remarks: \\"No break-up is painless. Somebody always gets hurt.\\" There's probably some metaphor involved. All the awesome fighty fights take place in the backdrop of Sex Bob-omb's competing in a battle of the bands (\\"We are Sex Bob-omb and we're here to make you think about death and get sad and stuff.\\").<br /><br />Life-long comic book nerd that I am, I really enjoyed this movie, but I'm not sure about the general public. SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD will ruffle some feathers in terms of how unorthodox it is cinematically, how eccentric it is. Scott Pilgrim, like Dave Lizewski, isn't mainstream like Iron Man or Batman. Thing is, the film keeps faith with its source origin and with its comic book fans. I guess the graphic novels generated enough buzz that a motion picture was felt warranted. But I don't know that a lot of people knew about Scott Pilgrim, going into this movie.<br /><br />The uninitiated are in for a rash of unexpectedness. Text graphics pop up without remorse, detailing the various characters' age and awesomeness rating and so forth. You can read the sound effects ala Adam West's Batman tv series. There are occasional forays thru the sub-space door. Magic exists, as does the Vegan league which bestows super-powers upon its members (there is also the Vegan police). The seven evil exes are all formidable and can kick serious tuchis, even the bi-furious teleporting ex. But, oddly enough, so can Scott Pilgrim. Much like in the comics, nothing about Scott Pilgrim prepares you for when he finally springs into action and goes all martial arts superhero-y (you simply don't expect that from Michael Cera). It's sort of a highlight, and the lack of explanation adds to the charm. Ramona becomes even more hot when she later throws down with an ex and breaks out a honking huge hammer. For the touchy-feely types, this movie even suggests some things about relationships among the twenty-somethings via story devices such as video game allegories and that metaphor of break-ups and fighty fights. If I had my own personal text caption, it would read as having given SCOTT PILGRIM VS. THE WORLD a rating of \\"Awesome!\\" Oh, and the indie-rock stuff is pretty ki(kass, too.<br /><br />The DVD's nifty special features: 21 deleted scenes, including an alternate ending in which Scott gets the other girl (totals 00:27:23 minutes and with optional Director's commentary); an option to watch the film with a running trivia track; a plentitude of audio commentary tracks, four of them, in fact: 1) with Director/Co-Writer Edgar Wright & Co-Writer Michael Bacall and author Bryan Lee O'Malley; 2) with actors Michael Cera, Jason Schwartzman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong, and Brandon Routh; 3) with more actors Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Kieran Culkin, and Mark Webber; and 4) technical commentary with Edgar Wright and Director of Photography Bill Pope; Scott Pilgrim vs. the Bloopers (00:09:39); a whaleload of photo and poster galleries, storyboards, conceptual art, and even a graphic novel comparison gallery; and production crew credits (just a listing of names).e other girl (totals 00:27:23 minutes and with optional Director's commentary); an option to watch the film with a running trivia track; a plentitude of audio commentary tracks, four of them, in fact: 1) with Director/Co-Writer Edgar Wright & Co-Writer Michael Bacall and author Bryan Lee O'Malley; 2) with actors Michael Cera, Jason Schwartzman, Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Ellen Wong, and Brandon Routh; 3) with more actors Anna Kendrick, Aubrey Plaza, Kieran Culkin, and Mark Webber; and 4) technical commentary with Edgar Wright and Director of Photography Bill Pope; Scott Pilgrim vs. the Bloopers (00:09:39); a whaleload of photo and poster galleries, storyboards, conceptual art, and even a graphic novel comparison gallery; and production crew credits (just a listing of names).
B002ZG98LO|1.0|If you are an action movie fan having greater than thirty or so years, director John McTiernan's \\"Predator\\" and Cameron's \\"Aliens\\" most likely comprise the binary stars within your solar system of much-loved sci-fi blockbuster films.  The brain acts as sponge for certain, (\\"Not a _______ scratch.\\") memorable quotes, the eyes continue to crave particular violent scenes, and the soul is sated with each repeated viewing.  It is not surprising, therefore, that any film which even hints at being within the same universe as \\"Predator\\" will guarantee the interest of many fans of the first film.  \\"Predator 2,\\" the 1990 Danny Glover vehicle, went off in some frankly bizarre directions, but yet maintained enough spunk and verve to continue to be regarded by most fans as canon.  The Alien skull cameo also tickled the imaginations of many fans for years, until the depredations of \\"AvP\\" and \\"AvP-Requiem\\" put an end to hope that a \\"combination/versus\\" movie could be done to anyone's satisfaction.<br /><br />Now, the palette of colors from \\"Predator\\" is tossed onto another hopelessly warped canvas--the \\"rebootquel,\\" a sub-sub-genre of film surely spawned from the 8th ring of hell.  \\"Predators\\" is obviously a shameless reboot but claims--according to a certain DVD-mailer's website--to simultaneously be a direct sequel to \\"Predator.\\"  Reboots/retreads/rewhatevers are nothing new, and have been going on since movie-making began--check out the number of \\"Dracula,\\" \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" and \\"King Kong\\" reboots should you doubt me.  Now, though, we have the \\"gritty reboot,\\" most likely to reflect how much greater is our, as an audience's, \\"grit\\" and moral ambiguity.  It, the gritty reboot, is also assumed to be a modern invention.  Please.  \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is pretty damn gritty, from a moral perspective, as is \\"Moby Dick.\\"  There is little under the sun that is new with story-telling.<br /><br />However, the makers of \\"Predators\\" can't even \\"grittify\\" this movie correctly.  Seriously, how it is possible to include Danny Trejo in a movie's line-up and completely screw up his signature type-cast, that of a sadistic, amoral, schizoid character who has a fondness for edged weaponry?  He honestly screams like a little girl during one part of the film, before being quickly done any with.  Perhaps the producers couldn't afford him for the whole gig?  Along the same lines, in which universe is it fathomable that the protagonist from \\"The Pianist\\" would be the character in \\"Predators\\" who is supposed to manifest Trejo's usual callings?  Adrien Brody plays the cold, calculating hunter, willing to sacrifice friends to draw forth the Predator?  No, just, no.<br /><br />The characters are thrust into the movie via parachute, awakening (or not) just in time to pull the ripcord before landing on terra firma to make introductions with the rest of the cast.  Brody plays the mercenary antihero Royce who apparently dabbles a bit in witchcraft, being able to mark the Asian man in the party as Yakuza purely based on his calm demeanor, designer suit, and bare feet.  The party, a mix of soldiers, mercenaries, death-squaddies, criminals, and one doctor (played by a confused-looking Topher Grace) gradually come to discover that they are on an alien planet, and the setting is \\"The More Dangerous (and More Hilarious) Game.\\"  There are some new bits of clothing that the screenwriters attempt to pin on the \\"Predator\\" franchise-mannequin:  \\"Predator\\" hunting-dogs, two warring factions, the planet being some sort of adaptive warfare training ground, and Laurence Fishburne, in a particularly short and embarrassing role which reeks of paycheck.  Morpheus would frown low indeed to see this descent.  One soon realizes, and pathetically quickly, that these \\"new\\" things are only poor camouflage attempting to conceal all that is direct copy.<br /><br />There are quotes, scenes, personas, music, and portions of dialogue that are quite literally lifted--word-for-word, scene-for-scene, gesture-for-gesture--from the first movie.  One could forgive this as slavering hero-worship, if one didn't get the very, very distinct sense that the director is attempting to pull a fast one and claim originality.  The party quickly encounters the remains of a fire-fight fought previously, with evidence of firing \\"in all directions.\\"  One member hefts a helicopter minigun as primary armament.  A character decides that his personal spirituality and honor demands personal, shirtless struggle with a Predator, blade to blade.  In a climactic final scene, Royce strips down to his trousers to reveal 143 pounds of robust, Predator-killing sinew, yelling \\"I'm here, do it, kill me now,\\" etc.  Isabelle, the one woman member is, of course, aware of the Predator's attack on Schwazenegger's team in Guatemala in 1987, and this mimics the role of Anna in the first film, another female character with singular knowledge of the alien.  Anything sound familiar?  It's all more sacrilege than homage.<br /><br />Alright, then perhaps the movie could stand on its own, subtracting any mention of \\"predator\\" to avoid comparison?  The answer is no--the movie is laughable, witless, and comprehensively stupid to the core.  It's so bad it flips over being good and goes back to being bad again.  The movie turns a thousand loaves of bread into one, takes the \\"mo\\" out of mojito, and makes Lucifer reconsider who his third head should munch on down there in the Inferno.  Director Nimrod Antal even manages to make the atmospheric music, chord-for-chord identical to that in \\"Predator,\\" seem ill-timed and silly much more often than not.  To summarize, this is a film which so shudderingly aches of complete failure, that by comparison \\"Predator\\" becomes a work of Socratic genius, instead of \\"just\\" having been a very good, late-80's action flick.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|While as you may have already read in another review, yes the Foo Fighters did take this album in a bit of a different direction than previous albums.  Nonetheless this is my favorite one, by far.  This is one of the few albums I can listen to from beginning to end without ever thinking of skipping a song.  The flow rolls like most track lists do, starting with more \\"awake\\" songs and transitioning into the softer ones. Both the hard and soft songs are amazing. All of my favorite Foo Fighters songs were once the common hard rock tracks, such as \\"All My Life\\", \\"The Pretender\\", and \\"Let it Die.\\" But when I gave In Your Honor a try, I fell in love with the softer side of this bands music.  If you are any kind of Foo Fighters fan, you gotta give this a try, you won't regret it.  Songs I suggest listening to first: \\"DOA\\", \\"Hell\\", \\"End Over End\\", and \\"Still.\\"
B003X2O6KW|4.0|Kanye West has been an entertainer both in the booth and out of it.  His personality and arrogant swagger is part of his \\"package\\" and image.  Everything he does is a very thought out action that he plans to either exploit by marketing himself or by enhancing his bravado image he has perfected.  This rubs some the wrong way, but still, those same people who can't stand the man can't help themselves but be entranced by his music.  He is a great entertainer in that way.<br /><br />His albums of the past have been different in their creation to the point that each do not seem to be produced by the same person.  Kanye has changed his musical direction between each album.  Yet, with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, he seems to take influences from each of his last albums and create a hybrid of what and who is Kanye West.  He succeeds in most of it, but falls flat on a few tracks.<br /><br />Track by Track<br /><br />1.) Dark Fantasy - 4/5 - This is the track that introduces the tone of the album to the listener.  Nicki Manaj comes on with her eccentric voice to proclaim what is to follow.  Kanye comes in hard with his flow.  He sounds energetic and passionate as ever.  Even though the subject matter seems to lack, he still brings his best in bringing his everything to his output.  Musically, one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The beat is infectious.  The chorus is great as well, it helps complete the track to be more than an introduction interlude to a complete song. Great track<br /><br />2.) Gorgeous f/Kid Cudi and Raekwon - 4/5 - This track is a great hip-hop track in the traditional way.  A great chorus which Cudi performs, the beat is very well produced and Kanye bring his bars tightly.  He plays with his voice a bit to make it sound like he might \\"broadcasting\\" instead of rapping, but it goes off well.  Raekwon adds some credit to the song by his verse towards the end.  Overall a great track.  Kanye even throws a South Park \\"Fish Sticks\\" line in there...<br /><br />3.) Power - 5/5 - The lead single off the album, which seems to have been out for a while now, as it was leaked to the net many months ago.  However, even by having listened to it multiple times before, it hasn't lost any of its impact yet.  This song is Kanye's most aggressive message to the fans and listeners and even critics.  He has all the \\"Power\\" in the music industry, even when he isn't releasing any songs at the time (Taylor Swift).  This is probably is most revealing track when it comes to his own mind.  Excellent track.<br /><br />4.) INTERLUDE<br /><br />5.) All of the Lights - 4/5 - Rihanna and Fergie do not get a credit on this song, but they are both in it,which seems to take away more than it does to make the song better.  Rihanna takes care of the chorus, which works, but Fergie's verse toward the end of the track is not needed (or wanted) by many of Kanye's fans.  However, the song is still very single worthy.  Kanye doesn't speak on much, but the production of the song drips with star power and radio play.<br /><br />6.) Monster f/Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj and Bon Iver - 3/5 - This track is another that seems to have been pushed for a single.  Kanye brings his best flow of the album to the song as he has to keep up with proven MCs like Jay-Z.  I've never been a fan of Ross or Minaj, but they seem to not really take away anything from the track.  The beat is infectious and \\"big.\\"  When it is all said and done, I feel that Kanye has the best verse on the track.  Jay comes in second with his but he didn't seem to bring his best effort or at least as much as he could have.  The listener will either hate or love Nicky Minaj's verse, which is more animated than other artist on the entire album.<br /><br />7.) So Appalled f/Jay-Z, Swizz Beatz, Pusha T and Prynce Ci Hi - 5/5 - Another track that is filled with features, directly after \\"Monster.\\"  It seems odd to have the tracks back to back because it feels to take away that it is indeed a Kanye album.  So Appalled however, is arguably the best track on the album.  When it comes to pure hip-hop in its most traditional sense (no bridges, over done choruses or beats), this track is the best.  Each verse from the MCs come off as if they brought their best effort to their words and flows.  Jay-Z and Pusha T especially, make the song more than what it would have been with any other artists.  If nobody knows who Pusha T is, they should do research.  The most underrated and under appreciated MC in music.  Period.<br /><br />8.) Devil in a New Dress f/Rick Ross 3/5 - If the first 7 tracks were filled with energy and highly produced songs, the second part of the album is more slow.  R&B tones and choruses take over, first introducing themselves on this track.  It's a great track, but seems to lose it's power over time.  Kanye raps about a woman who might \\"love Jesus, but learned a lot from Satan.\\"  Ross doesn't add anything to the track, as it could have been any MC featured on it.  In fact, it didn't really need a feature at all.  Kanye handles it.<br /><br />9.) Runaway f/Pusha T 5/5 - Probably the most brash song on the album.  It could have been a \\"808s & Heartbreaks\\" track, but instead calls out Kanye's own \\"douchebagery.\\"  It's a classic case of \\"you can't call me that because I just called myself that.\\"  Kanye plays with his critics at the same time he entertains them.  Autotune is on full effect on the track, yet it fits.  Pusha T adds some much needed flow.  Kanye's flow is not the greatest and his lyrics and lines seem to be very amateur, however I think it done with the intent on getting his message across clearly.  An excellent song that will be remembered as one of his most brash.<br /><br />10.) Hell of a Life 5/5 - My favorite track on the album.  The beat is hard.  The lyrics are aggressive.  The chorus is great.  However, the music is what comes across to me the most.  It makes the song.  The long bridges and pauses in lyrics, introduce instrumentals that have been Kanye's best out of all of his albums.  It's dripping with what Kanye wants to come across as.  Come with him and live a hellofa life.  It's a fantasy, but could very well be lived out by any star<br /><br />11.) Blame Game f/John Legend 5/5 - I've been waiting for Kanye to use Legend more in his songs.  He has been an asset to Kanye's label who is sadly under used.  This is the most R&B inspired track, as Legend doesn't simply take over for the chorus, he adds a lot more.  The beat is very emotional and the entire song is a personal story from Ye himself.  It could have been inspired by his newer relationships, because there have been public outings with models and such that have been surrounded by controversy.  Lyrically, it is probably the best when it comes to how Kanye tells his story.  One of the greatest tracks on the album.<br /><br />12.) Lost in the World f/Bon Iver 4/5 - The most autotuned track on the album.  It is a direct link to 808s & Heartbraks if that album was to be a dance inspired album.  This track comes in very slow, almost acapella with it's autotune, but several seconds in it irrupts into a dance track.  It's meant to influence the listener to \\"get lost in it.\\"  Kanye goes a little dark in his efforts, even though the tone seems to make you move.  It's  agreat track.<br /><br />13.) INTERLUDE/OUTRO<br /><br />All in all, Kanye West brings a very feature rich \\"pop\\" album.  But he does it his way.  He is an entertainer before he is a beatsmith or MC.  That is proven with this album.  It's not a typical hip-hop album.  It's very, very dark at times.  Other times its as eccentric as an Outkast album.  What needs to be known about the album though, is that musically, it is unmatched in today's hip-hop.  If one were to take away some of the effortless lyrics and some features that were not needed, this album would be a masterpiece.  Musically.um.  When it comes to pure hip-hop in its most traditional sense (no bridges, over done choruses or beats), this track is the best.  Each verse from the MCs come off as if they brought their best effort to their words and flows.  Jay-Z and Pusha T especially, make the song more than what it would have been with any other artists.  If nobody knows who Pusha T is, they should do research.  The most underrated and under appreciated MC in music.  Period.    8.) Devil in a New Dress f/Rick Ross 3/5 - If the first 7 tracks were filled with energy and highly produced songs, the second part of the album is more slow.  R&B tones and choruses take over, first introducing themselves on this track.  It's a great track, but seems to lose it's power over time.  Kanye raps about a woman who might \\"love Jesus, but learned a lot from Satan.\\"  Ross doesn't add anything to the track, as it could have been any MC featured on it.  In fact, it didn't really need a feature at all.  Kanye handles it.      9.) Runaway f/Pusha T 5/5 - Probably the most brash song on the album.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Kanye West has been in the Hip Hop game for many years, but his career as a true Hip Hop star began 6 years ago. Within those 6 years he has dropped 4 classic albums, produced many hits for many music artists in a variety of genres. Beyond music, Kanye West is unfortunately known for stirring up some public controversy. Kanye West is no stranger to the media, 2009 was not a particulary good year for West, being bagged by the media for his now infamous Taylor Swift interruption at the MTV Music Awards. On top of that, the death of his mother in 2008, the critiscm of racism towards Bush in 2005 and past relationships that did not go so well, being ridiculed all over the internet and even on TV shows like Saturday Night Live and South Park, Kanye West was on the decline in the popularity contest. However, you cannot disregard his genius in music, whether or not you liked the guy, he is truly a visionary in music, and legend in the Hip Hop community. Being able to combine different genre's together and making it sound as good as he does it, is truly hard to do these days where genre's are very one dimensional. \\"The College Dropout\\" was the start of his Hip Hop stardom known for his witty humorous lyrics, fast soulful sampling and conscious songs. \\"Late Registration\\" was a much more mature approach by Kanye experimenting more with a more orchaestrated sound full of strings and horns as well as his growth in popularity. \\"Graduation\\" was a more Pop-Rap album including techno and synthesizers's which sounded more catchy and radio friendly; the flaw of Gradution personally was the lack of consciousness in his lyrics in favor of more waterdown concept songs that were focused more about himself being braggadocios. \\"808's & Heartbreak\\" was not a Hip Hop album in a sense, but more of a personal endeavor. Musically Kanye was singing more and rapping less using Auto-Tune. The productions were more simplistic, and the lyrics were hook heavy. Kanye was in a very dark place during the creation of 808's, but he managed to create something that was frowned upon in the Hip Hop world at the time, but making it sound great. I loved 808's & Heartbreak despite it being a depressing musical experience.<br /><br />Now in 2010, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" is an album that deserves every merit it recieves. This is a Kanye that is hungry for more, and is searching to kill everyone in his path. Every track on this album has been carefully crafted in order to create an epic tale of life, love & power in Kanye's perspective. Kanye's rap schemes contain more aggressiveness and urgency, which is something we haven't seen in a long time from Mr. West probably since Late Registration. The production on this album is very credible, the scale of sounds in this album is truly remarkable in every sense, it is a loud and proud album to prove that Kanye is one of the best Hip Hop artists of all time. This album features a large amount of guest appearences; artists such as Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, Bon Iver, Kid Cudi, John Legend and Pusha T appear twice on the album. But even with all of these atrists featured, the album does not feel overwhelmed, you can still tell this is primarily Kanye's album despite the fact that Kanye is never truly by himself on a track. This album is already considered to be Kanye's best album to date and is also cited as a postmodern classic is music.<br /><br />1) Dark Fantasy - The album starts off with a little intro from Nicki Minaj using a fake british accent (very amusing though) and starts off with Kanye's first line \\"I fantasize about this back in Chicago\\" beginning his epic tale to let you into his twisted fantasy. The track features production from the legendary Wu-Tang Clansman the RZA which was very exciting for me being a Wu-Tang fan, it has a great retro piano beat which really takes it back to the golden age of hip hop, has a very old school feel to it. The hook is very catchy and very eerie. Kanye proves with thistrack how clever he really is when it comes to rapping, \\"Too many urkels on your team, thats why your wins-low\\" and with that said he gets you ready for the amazingness that he is about to bring us with the rest of the album. 5/5<br /><br />2) Gorgeous feat. Kid Cudi & Raekwon - This song takes a break from the ruggedness of the first song and has a more sober approach. This is the most lyrical song on the album tackling religion, politics, racism etc. Kid Cudi provides the hook while Kanye lays down 3 substantial verses. Raekwon drops in at the end providing a good verse and its nice to know that Kanye likes to team up with Hip Hop legends. 4/5<br /><br />3) Power feat. Dwele - Everyone should know this song by now. This is Kanye's return to form from the 808's & Heartbreak sound. Kanye is truly back to rapping and all three verses prove even though his ego may be big, he has earned every right to be the way he is. He truly has the power to make your life so exciting. The production on this track is truly amazing featuring tribal drums as well as vocal samples from a song I have never heard of. The songs hook features a sample from King Crimsons \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" as well as soulful backdrop from Dwele. This song is already an instant classic. 5/5<br /><br />4) All of the Lights (Interlude) - What I like about Kanye the most is his taste in music, this interlude is beautiful and even though only 1 minute long, I almost cryed by the soft piano and beautiful strings. 5/5<br /><br />5) All of the Lights - I heard this song way back at the end of summer and it originally had Drake on it. Drakes verse was stripped and instead Kanye put an additional vocals from 10 artists. This track features Rihanna, Alicia Keys, Fergie, The-Dream, Ryan Leslie, Elton John, Charlie Wilson, Kid Cudi, John Legend, Tony Williams & Elly Jackson all on one track. Rihanna does the catchy hook, Kid Cudi does a short interlude, Fergie drops a breif verse, Alicia Keys and Elton John combine at the end ending the monstrous track. This track is a prime example of how great Kanye is as a producer being able to combine different vocals being used as instruments to create one legendary track. I just wish the track was a little longer and had the Drake verse that originally was featured. The maniacal production and attention to detail made this an easy personal favorite of the album for me. 5/5<br /><br />6) Monster feat. Bon Iver, Rick Ross, Jay-Z & Nicki Minaj - I heard this song back during the summer and honestly I did not like it as much. I thought the collaboration was a bit random and the song was a bit too long for its own good. But that was then, and NOW I love this track. Each artist provides a great verse, Kanye West explains how much effect his presence has, Jay-Z embodies himself as a legendary monster amongst the likes of Lochness, and Rick Ross opens up the song. Nicki Minaj however RIPS THIS TRACK TO SHREDS, she pulls out every trick she has implementing her psychotic persona and even weirder lyrics. Bon Iver does a great job doing a haunting intro and outro. 5/5<br /><br />7) So Appalled feat. Swizz Beatz, Jay-Z, Pusha T, CyHi the Prynce & the RZA - This marks the 2nd posse track in a row. Jay-Z comes in again with one of the best verses I've heard from him in a while. Kanye does a decent job with his verse. The song features G.O.O.D. Music artists  Pusha T from the Clipse and newcomer CyHi the Prynce and they give the track an extra edge that is much appreciated. What makes this track so exciting for me is to hear RZA's voice at the end, even though he was only doing the hook, it was just legendary to have him on the track ( at least in my opinion). 4.5/5<br /><br />8) Devil in a New Dress feat. Rick Ross - This is probably my least favorite track on the album, but I don't take anything away from this song. This is the only track on the album not fully produced by Kanye; with the help of Bink!, they created a production beautifully haunting. And while I don't normally like Rick Ross, his contribution to the song was actually pretty good. 4/5<br /><br />9) Runaway feat. Pusha T - This longest song clocking in just over 9 minutes in length. The song was first heard at the 2010 VMA's and was reviewed very well. At first listen, I was not very impressed with the musicality of the track, I felt the simple piano beat behind the Pete Rock sample wasn't very impressive. But after a while I began to appreciate the message of the song and the lyrics was what got my attention. This song is the most personal on this album and is a straight message to everybody that has hated on Kanye. This song is also about Kanye's thought about life, he just wished he could runaway from all the world in itself just wishes people could understand his intentions despite how different his views are. Pusha T has a good verse but I believe someone else could've been on the track instead of him. The first 5 1/2 minutes of the some is the core, while the last 3 1/2 are just pure instrumentals. If you think Kanye was done with auto-tune, you are dead wrong. However, he uses the autotune effect not for singing but like another instrument. While I believe that the length was a bit too prolonged it is still a remarkable track. 5/5<br /><br />10) Hell of a Life - Here we take a step back from the reality of Kanye and back into the fantasy life. Here Kanye talks about marrying a pornstar living the life he thought he would ever want to live. The production is gritty almost like a rock track. This track is the darkest, filled distorted sounds flying left and right, accompanied with a great hook by Kanye recreating the melody of the song \\"Iron Man\\" by Black Sabbath. It's really an interesting song that seperates itself from the rest of the album. 5/5<br /><br />11) Blame Game feat. John Legend - A beautifully constructed track in which Kanye becomes a bit vulnerable. It is a confessional track where Kanye admits the wrongs he has done during his past relationship (possibly with Amber Rose). The first verse is heartfelt from John Legend, while the second verse Kanye confesses. The third verse is a combination of Kanye's voice in different pitches. Amongst all the seriousness of the song, the track ends with humorous skit from Chris Rock. Yet another long track being almost 8 minutes, it is also one of the best of the album . 5/5<br /><br />12) Lost in the World feat. Bon Iver - The song starts off with a slow excerpt from Bon Iver's song \\"Woods\\" and builds up from there. A very fitting way to end a great album. Full of loud african drums and great singing from both artists. It has been a great ride and this album was just pure ear candy to those who appreciate great music in general. The song is just a continuation of Kanye's journey to the next world and evolution as a human being. I love the premise of the song and the overall message. Kanye is just a lost soul trying to find his rightful place in the world and an overall understanding with life. Great song, I Love it. 5/5<br /><br />13) Who Will Surivive in America - An outro featuring an inspirational excerpt from Gil-Scott Heron's Comment #1. I'm glad I bought this album. Everyone should go out and get it just to support G.O.O.D. music and Kanye.mbine at the end ending the monstrous track. This track is a prime example of how great Kanye is as a producer being able to combine different vocals being used as instruments to create one legendary track. I just wish the track was a little longer and had the Drake verse that originally was featured. The maniacal production and attention to detail made this an easy personal favorite of the album for me. 5/5<br /><br />6) Monster feat.

B003X2O6MK|4.0|Kanye West has been an entertainer both in the booth and out of it.  His personality and arrogant swagger is part of his \\"package\\" and image.  Everything he does is a very thought out action that he plans to either exploit by marketing himself or by enhancing his bravado image he has perfected.  This rubs some the wrong way, but still, those same people who can't stand the man can't help themselves but be entranced by his music.  He is a great entertainer in that way.<br /><br />His albums of the past have been different in their creation to the point that each do not seem to be produced by the same person.  Kanye has changed his musical direction between each album.  Yet, with My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, he seems to take influences from each of his last albums and create a hybrid of what and who is Kanye West.  He succeeds in most of it, but falls flat on a few tracks.<br /><br />Track by Track<br /><br />1.) Dark Fantasy - 4/5 - This is the track that introduces the tone of the album to the listener.  Nicki Manaj comes on with her eccentric voice to proclaim what is to follow.  Kanye comes in hard with his flow.  He sounds energetic and passionate as ever.  Even though the subject matter seems to lack, he still brings his best in bringing his everything to his output.  Musically, one of my favorite tracks on the album.  The beat is infectious.  The chorus is great as well, it helps complete the track to be more than an introduction interlude to a complete song. Great track<br /><br />2.) Gorgeous f/Kid Cudi and Raekwon - 4/5 - This track is a great hip-hop track in the traditional way.  A great chorus which Cudi performs, the beat is very well produced and Kanye bring his bars tightly.  He plays with his voice a bit to make it sound like he might \\"broadcasting\\" instead of rapping, but it goes off well.  Raekwon adds some credit to the song by his verse towards the end.  Overall a great track.  Kanye even throws a South Park \\"Fish Sticks\\" line in there...<br /><br />3.) Power - 5/5 - The lead single off the album, which seems to have been out for a while now, as it was leaked to the net many months ago.  However, even by having listened to it multiple times before, it hasn't lost any of its impact yet.  This song is Kanye's most aggressive message to the fans and listeners and even critics.  He has all the \\"Power\\" in the music industry, even when he isn't releasing any songs at the time (Taylor Swift).  This is probably is most revealing track when it comes to his own mind.  Excellent track.<br /><br />4.) INTERLUDE<br /><br />5.) All of the Lights - 4/5 - Rihanna and Fergie do not get a credit on this song, but they are both in it,which seems to take away more than it does to make the song better.  Rihanna takes care of the chorus, which works, but Fergie's verse toward the end of the track is not needed (or wanted) by many of Kanye's fans.  However, the song is still very single worthy.  Kanye doesn't speak on much, but the production of the song drips with star power and radio play.<br /><br />6.) Monster f/Jay-Z, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj and Bon Iver - 3/5 - This track is another that seems to have been pushed for a single.  Kanye brings his best flow of the album to the song as he has to keep up with proven MCs like Jay-Z.  I've never been a fan of Ross or Minaj, but they seem to not really take away anything from the track.  The beat is infectious and \\"big.\\"  When it is all said and done, I feel that Kanye has the best verse on the track.  Jay comes in second with his but he didn't seem to bring his best effort or at least as much as he could have.  The listener will either hate or love Nicky Minaj's verse, which is more animated than other artist on the entire album.<br /><br />7.) So Appalled f/Jay-Z, Swizz Beatz, Pusha T and Prynce Ci Hi - 5/5 - Another track that is filled with features, directly after \\"Monster.\\"  It seems odd to have the tracks back to back because it feels to take away that it is indeed a Kanye album.  So Appalled however, is arguably the best track on the album.  When it comes to pure hip-hop in its most traditional sense (no bridges, over done choruses or beats), this track is the best.  Each verse from the MCs come off as if they brought their best effort to their words and flows.  Jay-Z and Pusha T especially, make the song more than what it would have been with any other artists.  If nobody knows who Pusha T is, they should do research.  The most underrated and under appreciated MC in music.  Period.<br /><br />8.) Devil in a New Dress f/Rick Ross 3/5 - If the first 7 tracks were filled with energy and highly produced songs, the second part of the album is more slow.  R&B tones and choruses take over, first introducing themselves on this track.  It's a great track, but seems to lose it's power over time.  Kanye raps about a woman who might \\"love Jesus, but learned a lot from Satan.\\"  Ross doesn't add anything to the track, as it could have been any MC featured on it.  In fact, it didn't really need a feature at all.  Kanye handles it.<br /><br />9.) Runaway f/Pusha T 5/5 - Probably the most brash song on the album.  It could have been a \\"808s & Heartbreaks\\" track, but instead calls out Kanye's own \\"douchebagery.\\"  It's a classic case of \\"you can't call me that because I just called myself that.\\"  Kanye plays with his critics at the same time he entertains them.  Autotune is on full effect on the track, yet it fits.  Pusha T adds some much needed flow.  Kanye's flow is not the greatest and his lyrics and lines seem to be very amateur, however I think it done with the intent on getting his message across clearly.  An excellent song that will be remembered as one of his most brash.<br /><br />10.) Hell of a Life 5/5 - My favorite track on the album.  The beat is hard.  The lyrics are aggressive.  The chorus is great.  However, the music is what comes across to me the most.  It makes the song.  The long bridges and pauses in lyrics, introduce instrumentals that have been Kanye's best out of all of his albums.  It's dripping with what Kanye wants to come across as.  Come with him and live a hellofa life.  It's a fantasy, but could very well be lived out by any star<br /><br />11.) Blame Game f/John Legend 5/5 - I've been waiting for Kanye to use Legend more in his songs.  He has been an asset to Kanye's label who is sadly under used.  This is the most R&B inspired track, as Legend doesn't simply take over for the chorus, he adds a lot more.  The beat is very emotional and the entire song is a personal story from Ye himself.  It could have been inspired by his newer relationships, because there have been public outings with models and such that have been surrounded by controversy.  Lyrically, it is probably the best when it comes to how Kanye tells his story.  One of the greatest tracks on the album.<br /><br />12.) Lost in the World f/Bon Iver 4/5 - The most autotuned track on the album.  It is a direct link to 808s & Heartbraks if that album was to be a dance inspired album.  This track comes in very slow, almost acapella with it's autotune, but several seconds in it irrupts into a dance track.  It's meant to influence the listener to \\"get lost in it.\\"  Kanye goes a little dark in his efforts, even though the tone seems to make you move.  It's  agreat track.<br /><br />13.) INTERLUDE/OUTRO<br /><br />All in all, Kanye West brings a very feature rich \\"pop\\" album.  But he does it his way.  He is an entertainer before he is a beatsmith or MC.  That is proven with this album.  It's not a typical hip-hop album.  It's very, very dark at times.  Other times its as eccentric as an Outkast album.  What needs to be known about the album though, is that musically, it is unmatched in today's hip-hop.  If one were to take away some of the effortless lyrics and some features that were not needed, this album would be a masterpiece.  Musically.um.  When it comes to pure hip-hop in its most traditional sense (no bridges, over done choruses or beats), this track is the best.  Each verse from the MCs come off as if they brought their best effort to their words and flows.  Jay-Z and Pusha T especially, make the song more than what it would have been with any other artists.  If nobody knows who Pusha T is, they should do research.  The most underrated and under appreciated MC in music.  Period.    8.) Devil in a New Dress f/Rick Ross 3/5 - If the first 7 tracks were filled with energy and highly produced songs, the second part of the album is more slow.  R&B tones and choruses take over, first introducing themselves on this track.  It's a great track, but seems to lose it's power over time.  Kanye raps about a woman who might \\"love Jesus, but learned a lot from Satan.\\"  Ross doesn't add anything to the track, as it could have been any MC featured on it.  In fact, it didn't really need a feature at all.  Kanye handles it.      9.) Runaway f/Pusha T 5/5 - Probably the most brash song on the album.  It could have been a \\"808s & Heartbreaks\\" track, but instead calls out Kanye's own \\"douchebagery.\\"  It's a classic case of \\"you can't call me that because I just called myself that.\\"  Kanye plays with his critics at the same time he entertains them.  Autotune is on full effect on the track, yet it fits.  Pusha T adds some much needed flow.  Kanye's flow is not the greatest and his lyrics and lines seem to be very amateur, however I think it done with the intent on getting his message across clearly.  An excellent song that will be remembered as one of his most brash.    10.) Hell of a Life 5/5 - My favorite track on the album.  The beat is hard.  The lyrics are aggressive.  The chorus is great.  However, the music is what comes across to me the most.  It makes the song.  The long bridges and pauses in lyrics, introduce instrumentals that have been Kanye's best out of all of his albums.  It's dripping with what Kanye wants to come across as.  Come with him and live a hellofa life.  It's a fantasy, but could very well be lived out by any star    11.) Blame Game f/John Legend 5/5 - I've been waiting for Kanye to use Legend more in his songs.  He has been an asset to Kanye's label who is sadly under used.  This is the most R&B inspired track, as Legend doesn't simply take over for the chorus, he adds a lot more.  The beat is very emotional and the entire song is a personal story from Ye himself.  It could have been inspired by his newer relationships, because there have been public outings with models and such that have been surrounded by controversy.  Lyrically, it is probably the best when it comes to how Kanye tells his story.  One of the greatest tracks on the album.    12.) Lost in the World f/Bon Iver 4/5 - The most autotuned track on the album.  It is a direct link to 808s & Heartbraks if that album was to be a dance inspired album.  This track comes in very slow, almost acapella with it's autotune, but several seconds in it irrupts into a dance track.  It's meant to influence the listener to \\"get lost in it.\\"  Kanye goes a little dark in his efforts, even though the tone seems to make you move.  It's  agreat track.    13.) INTERLUDE/OUTRO     All in all, Kanye West brings a very feature rich \\"pop\\" album.  But he does it his way.  He is an entertainer before he is a beatsmith or MC.  That is proven with this album.  It's not a typical hip-hop album.  It's very, very dark at times.  Other times its as eccentric as an Outkast album.  What needs to be known about the album though, is that musically, it is unmatched in today's hip-hop.  If one were to take away some of the effortless lyrics and some features that were not needed, this album would be a masterpiece.  Musically.
B003Q6D27S|1.0|Saw VII (Kevin Gruetert, 2010)<br /><br />I had absolutely no intention of ever letting Saw VII (aka Saw 3D) pass between my eyelids. But my daughter wanted to see it in the theater, and she has an odd relationship with horror movies. She likes them, but prefers to know what's going to happen. Thus, I found myself watching what I knew was going to be one of the worst movies of the year in order to be able to relate the events to the kid so she could watch it. A parent's trials are never done.<br /><br />So here we have what we are being promised is the final chapter of this series, which started off so well and got so bad so fast. As with the rest of the series since the second, half the movie has an incredibly weak plot, in which Hoffman (Costas Mandylor) tries to get to Jill (Betsy Russell). We're no longer even sure why. He can't be erasing his tracks, since basically the entire world's police know he's taken over the jigsaw role. The other half of the movie is all about the elaborate torture traps that various people have to endure. The \\"main\\" trap involves Bobby Dugan (Sean Patrick Flanery), a self-help guru who wrote a book about surviving a Jigsaw trap. Ah, hubris. He finds himself in another one, with his trophy wife at the end of it. There are a few other traps involved that have nothing to do with anything. Surprised? Not remotely.<br /><br />When James Wan, who devised the storyline for the original, bailed after the first movie, the series kinda fell off a cliff. When Leigh Whannell, who designed the traps for the first movie, also bailed, the series floated down to the bottom of the Marianas Trench. Both have stick around as \\"Executive Producers\\", which basically means \\"we throw money and you and get a cut of the profits.\\" Why shouldn't they? Everyone with half a brain was well aware that this movie, like all the other entries in the franchise, was going to make money hand over fist. When Wan is in the director's chair, good things get done (viz. the highly underrated Dead Silence from 2007), but Kevin Gruetert, who directed Saw VI, is not nearly James Wan. (IMDB trivia reports that Gruetert was roped into directing this after being signed on for Paranormal Activity 2. I guess there IS a silver lining to this movie, because I can't imagine what a mess he'd have made of that....) Nor have the rest of the franchise's directors, but Gruetert, along with the Melton/Dunstan scriptwriting team who have been responsible for this mess since Saw IV, have taken it to new lows. The more Melton and Dunstan tried to turn it into a soap opera, the more amused I was. This installment is no exception, with a couple of scenes that are supposed to refresh your memory of Saw VI. Except I can't imagine anyone has any memories of Saw VI, unless they watched it just before going to see this. None of the films since II has been in any way memorable. This latest (and hopefully, really, last) in the franchise is no different; those most you'll take away from it is a couple of snatches of interesting, semi-devious trap setups. None of which, I will hasten to add, is nearly as good as the one from the original film. But isn't that always the way? *ence from 2007), but Kevin Gruetert, who directed Saw VI, is not nearly James Wan.

0590129279|2.0|Despite what Amazon says, this is NOT Katherine Woods's version. I can't agree more with Allie Jones's critique. I bought a copy of this translation, but was so disappointed by the translation that I gave it away soon after. Allie Jones's example for the translation of \\"L'essentiel est invisible pour les yeux\\" is exactly what I was thinking of; and as perhaps the most important lessons / most quoted lines from the book, it qualifies as a touchstone to the quality of translation. And yes, this one line alone shows the superiority of Katherine Woods's.    Somewhere in the foreword I remember the translator (or is that a reviewer?) claiming the need for a new translation to keep up with the time -- WRONG. Katherine Woods's work is so beautiful that upon reading and re-reading, I have never found anything that needs to be updated for the modern reader. The definition of good English has not changed so in the past 60 years.    So really, get the Katherine Woods translation. You won't regret it.

B003X2O6KW|5.0|Instead of the usual albums that consist of mainly a few radio singles and fillers, Kanye West has constructed a cohesive album with meticulously crafted layers of sounds.  His irreverence of hip hop status quo is found throughout the album.  Instead of going for the minimal beats that many songs in the genre are favoring at the moment, West's songs are lush and sounds larger than his ego, if that is possible.    Even though West is pushing the boundaries of hip hop, he still can't seem to escape the one constant that's a staple of all rap albums, the rap skit.  If West can't make an album without a rap skit, maybe no one ever can...
0060558121|4.0|I had never heard of Neil Gaiman or read any \\"modern fantasy\\" prior to being indroduced to American Gods. I had no idea what to expect going in. A few times I wondered what my friend was thinking when he highly recommended this book. Afterward I could not wait to dive into [[ASIN:ASIN Anansi Boys]] (which is not a sequel, but instead a darkly humurous spin-off).<br />  Gaiman is an amazing story teller. Even his characters tell awesome stories. There is so much character development seemlessly blended in this captivating story, I felt concern for the protagonist AND his friends. I have since read a few books by this author, and it only gets better. \\"AG\\" is witty, unpredictable, inspired, and engrossing. If its your first foray into this genre or author, you will agree its unexpectedly good.
1608870081|5.0|Both ruggedly built and finely crafted, this book is a delightful blend of exceptionally detailed art and in-depth, behind-the-scenes information that both children and adults can enjoy equally.  When I first opened the book, I was enthralled with the breathtaking art.  The pages are lush and realistic; flipping through them is like flying through the world of Harry Potter on your Firebolt.    As if the fantastic artwork were not enough to make me buy this book, the unbelievable amount of source information on the filming of the Harry Potter franchise puts this book in a rank of its own.  I have seen other well-made pop-up books about famous films, but I have never before seen one that explains about how the film was made and how the scenes were conceived.  This book goes so far as to tell you the real-life name of Hedwig and the fact that the owl had \\"stand-ins.\\"  Because of this level of detailed information, reading it is a very satisfying learning experience.  And if you are thinking that this information targets a more mature audience, think again.  This book's descriptions of behind-the-scenes facts are written in a manner that most reading levels can easily grasp.    Adding together the brilliant artwork and informative content of this book, I would highly recommend its purchase to any Harry Potter fan.
B004498KPU|5.0|This box set includes most of all of Michael Jackson's music videos. Thriller is great, but this collection will allow you to experience more of why Michael Jackson's talents and creativity will never be matched. The only thing that can ever possibly top this box set is a boxed collection of MJ's live performances. Today's music artists will never be able to compile a collection of videos this captivating. Although, I'm sure that likes of lady gaga will try, with all her wannabe weirdness and \\"unique short films\\", however cannot compete, obviously, with pure talent.
B001IF5YLQ|2.0|Clearly Apple did not do their testing homework with this one.   When using this product, I found that my Wifi connection became useless.  At first I couldn't believe the display adapter would cause such problems, but after plugging and unplugging several times while watching the network speed on the Activity Monitor, I found that this was the cause of my WiFi problems.    A few possible workarounds can improve the Wifi situation, but not fix it 100%:  - make sure your Mac and the display you are connecting it too are plugged into grounded outlets  - add an RF choke to the adapter cable  - change the orientation of the adapter :-/ Amazingly for me if the adapter cable is bent to a 90degree angle, the WiFi throughput seems to drop to zero, whereas if the adapter is aligned to stick straight out with the cable as straight as possible, then the WiFi throughput seems to be maximised.

1439181780|5.0|I love this book. It is better than \\"The Secret\\". If you understand it and try to live as the book explain, anyone can experience what she says in the book. It is just that most of us live in this super busy world with so much negetive things happening around us constantly, sometimes it is very hard to shield from them. At least if one knows what is possible by reading this book, I guess it may be helpful. I have given this book as gifts to many I know.
B00104WHLA|5.0|The DVD's need a region 2 player on this one. I have not verified if these sound any better than the NTSC release. It is unlikely but possible I suppose.
B0041VV03A|1.0|I was disappointed in the movie.  I did not see any redeeming value in the characters.  The plot was disturbing.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have to admit that I was really worried about this cd, especially not being produced by David Foster.  I've always believed Josh's other cds were perfection and I was uneasy about accepting too much of a change.  After finally being able to listen to it in its entirety, I was very relieved, but I also wasn't exactly blown away as I'd been with the others.  There are albums out there that need to be listened to several times before making a final decision, and I feel this is one of them.  After perhaps 3 or 4 more listens, I was mesmerized.  I found myself loving the simplicity of it all, if that is the right word.  The tunes are gorgeous and stay in my head day and night, the words are beautifully sad and sweet.  And then there's that voice---no need to gush because we all know.      Any of you who might be disappointed in this cd really need to sit down and give it a few runs.  You will be amazed.  I went from not being quite sure to now knowing that this cd is on a par with, and maybe even surpass, all his other albums.  Love, love, love it!!
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|Ive known for a while she has some worshippers or whatever your might call them. Some of these people will almost try to hurt you if you say you dont like her music. OR Simply, this Album is Exremely weak... Extremely. SHe has her moments but with all that Hype and everybody including most females trying to Play cute instead of knowing what Rap is. They just rate her on how she looks which after all the surgery she has done is starting to look like a Wierdo. Anyway as far as the Album goes she had to at the last minute include Romans Revenge Ft. Eminem, which is one of the tracks that are actually ok. Im the Best, is alright. Other than that DO NOT listen to Her Blog Page... and Fans posting 5 Stars reviews on here. This is PURE Hype and no real substance. Dont be fooled by that sympathy song she has on here. Its too little too late. Pink Friday belongs back in the studio. Needs alot of work trust me. Dont waste your money. This is not what it Hyped up to be.
B0042RUMEQ|3.0|I expected Nicki's cd to be boring with her quirky annoying voice and dumb lyrics but in actuality the album is not that bad. It's listenable, I'm not saying it'll be in my CD player for long but she released an album that is worthy of a listen. The only thing that annoyed me the most was the annoying autotune. The autotune era is over, i wish people would give it a rest.<br /><br />Otherwise lyrically she's not the greatest, but she did hold her own. It's a good first effort.<br /><br />Favorites. roman's revenge and did it on em.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I am a Josh Groban fan but bitterly disappointed in this album after waiting so long to receive it! He can do much better. Josh should leave the song writing to others and focus on the vocals. His vocals are not up to his usual standard on this CD. I wouldn't recommend this CD even to the most ardent Grobanite. Sorry, Josh.
1439152780|3.0|A great story but....slow to start and too wordy!!  Loved her first 2 books and I did like this story, I just got bogged down by too much information!
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS SO CRAZY. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. I ALWAYS LOVED NICKI MINAJ BUT THIS ALBUM HAS MADE ME REALLY KNOW SHE BELONGS RIGHT WHERE SHE IS. AS SOON AS I GOT THE CD I WAS BLOWN AWAY. FROM THE BEGINNING TILL END YOU DON'T NEED TO HIT THAT NEXT BOTTOM WHATSOEVER. MY FAVORITE SONGS RIGHT NOW ARE \\"ROMANS REVENGE\\" \\"DID IT ON'EM\\" AND \\"MOMENT 4 LIFE\\" EVERY TIME I HEAR THESE TRACKS I HAVE SOME KIND OF NICKI MINAJ OUT OF BODY EXPERIENCE LOL BUT BESIDES ALL THAT CONGRATULATIONS TO THE REAL BARBIE. YOUNG MONEY/CASH MONEY <3 CHEAH!!
B000683VI4|1.0|This movie had me rolling my eyes so hard that I pulled a muscle and had to wear an eyepatch for 2 weeks.  When other women tell me it's their favorite movie, I secretly judge them and think they must be shallow, predictable and boring.<br /><br />Spoiler ahead (although if you have a half a braincell, you will figure out where the movie is heading like 5 minutes after it starts):<br /><br />Here we have the classic mismatched couple from different sides of the tracks. Allie and the guy fight and argue their way into bed and call it a love story.  He is infatuated with her annoyingness and bright red lipstick.  She is infatuated with him because he 'gets' her free-spiritedness... blah blah.. argue... sex. repeat.  They constantly do stupid things to show each other how cute they are.  He climbs a ferris wheel.  They lay in the middle of the road. She pretends to be a bird while wearing a heinous bikini with a matching gigantic poofy headband.<br /><br />What makes this movie especially ridiculous is that not only do we get to watch how these dumbbells fall in love when they're hot and young, we also get to see them as senior citizens..  Yay.  Who doesn't love old people? There's a twist, however, and it's supposed to make you feel really, really awful. Allie has Alzheimers (I mean, did N. Sparks name her after the disease?) and the guy has a debilitating case of true love.  Still. He stays at the nursing home with her even though she doesn't even know who he is and he could probably afford to have care for her at home.  But every day he reads to her about their moronic love story, hoping she'll remember...  And one day... She does! But then they die, in bed together, for no real reason.  And then you're supposed to cry.<br /><br />I know, right?  It's stoooooopid.

B004A1Y4UM|5.0|Awesome! The only way to describe this album. I love all of their work, and they continue to put out great music. It doesn't matter if you are a metalhead or a groovehead, this album (and all of their previous work) won't disapoint. The Elvis-ish style of singing adds such a unique element to their music. Even my kids love to jam Volbeat. One of the few true metal bands who know how to create an album that rocks all the way through, with no sagging in the middle. Great job on this one, Volbeat! I only wish they had more airplay in the States. I'd love to catch a live show.
044654759X|5.0|When a mysterious young woman named Katie appears in the small North Carolina town of Southport, her sudden arrival raises questions about her past. Beautiful yet self-effacing, Katie seems determined to avoid forming personal ties until a series of events draws her into two reluctant relationships: one with Alex, a widowed store owner with a kind heart and two young children; and another with her plain single neighbor, Jo. Despite her reservations, Katie slowly begins to let down her guard, putting down roots in the close-knit community and becoming increasingly attached to Alex and his family.<br /><br />But even as Katie begins to fall in love, she struggles with the dark secret that still haunts and terrifies her...a past that set her on a fearful, shattering journey across the country, to the sheltered oasis of Southport.<br /><br />With Jo's empathetic and stubborn support, Katie eventually realizes that she must choose between a life of transient safety and one of riskier rewards...and that in the darkest hour, love is the only true safe haven.<br /><br />In the newest novel, Safe Haven by Nicholas Sparks, this time we have a love story with a sinister past waiting in the wings. The story of forgiveness, betrayal, and unfailing love are the ingredients that make this a 5 star book in my opinion. This book was like a blending of the movie Sleeping with the Enemy alongside your classic love never dies storyline and the ending will leave you completely amazed beyond words. What a great ending that I never saw coming!<br /><br />I received this book compliments of Hachette Book Groups for my honest review and must say to pick this one up for the holidays. It will completely warm your heart! It's available in hardcover, audio, CD, MP3, and eBook formats.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|It's been four years since My Chemical Romance put out an album. I won't lie, I was originally a bit worried about it coming out. They'd grown up, started families and life happened. They were different people than when they first started, and it's just what they needed. As soon as Na Na Na was released, my fears were gone. Out was the dark cloud that seemed to loom over the band in the final days of The Black Parade and in came  a brand new band. A new band coming to us in color, a new band that was having fun and for the first time in years seemed to be enjoying what they were doing.     Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys is an album that takes you on a fast paced ride that never lets you look back. You're running from dracs, enjoying the good times and loving the people you're with. There's a direct message in the music, tho the members of My Chemical Romance have promised that wasn't the intention. The album's lyrics and meanings are left to interpretation, however there's one thing for certain: The boys are having an amazing time.    The songs are fun. Fast paced with a catchy beat that blows all the current \\"rock\\" music out of the water.  The lyrics are fun, to the point and a (non) message for the masses.     Gone are the uniforms and the feeling of dread. They are back with action packed rock and roll that will get anyone up and off their feet. They're breakin all the rules, and the album benefits from it.     The best album of 2010!
B003YUC2FE|3.0|Mildly excited, waiting for the ultimate 10 disc set. I wanted my two boys, ages 1 and 3 to be able to have this media experience for their childhood, so I'm expecting to receive something substantial to weather the years. The collectible toy box provided for disc storage was the ultimate...joke?!#!!    What a disappointment to open this up and discover 10 discs sitting in a foam cutout, all encased by a flimsy, laminated, waxy shaped toybox, which slides into the paper presentation box to be proudly stored on your shelf for the millenia...or next week, until one of the rugrats decides to take matters into their own hands and opens it themselves. That will be the end of the \\"collectible\\". I suppose Pixar's definition of collectible is, \\" for adults only\\". Very crappy job on the packaging, for the money I spent I would have much rather purchased each movie individually - with blu ray cases.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|I'm loving this cd, my friend hook me into Nicki, now I find myself listening to her cd everyday. First were the mix cd's, now Pink Friday, I love all the songs on here. Good Job Nicki! You have another fan.
1439107955|5.0|It is difficult to even imagine the stacks of reports, articles, notes and interviews that Dr. Mukherjee processed to produce this fabulous book. Each page explains, in very readable prose, complex, arcane subjects. For anyone looking for reason to hope that their cancer is curable, this book is trove of stories of lives saved and changed by the work of cancer researchers.   This book will be referenced in other works for a long time.
B003XU02QG|4.0|I enjoyed the movie as a \\"what if\\" scenario. The Fate of the IX Legion \\"Hispana\\" is shrouded in mystery. Many scholars have conflicting theories. This film depicts the theory that is currently popular and carries a majority.<br /><br />The film itself deserves credit for being very historically accurate for the costumes, weapons, and armor. The depiction of the tactics are abridged or made to film. But the concept is dead on. Even the houses are constructed properly to era !!!!<br /><br />The film itself literally starts at the run and really doesn't slow down even at the end. It centers on the story of a frontier garrison centurion who's post is overrun by marauding Pict raiders who have been playing hit and run with the Roman garrisons in southern Caledonia (Scotland) prior to the construction of Hadrian's Wall and the Antonine Wall. He, the centurion (Fassbender), is captured and interrogated ( with some antiquity style waterboarding ) and escapes or set free he eventually meets up with the main column of the IX legion who have been sent North to conquer the Picts for the ambitious Governor of Britiannia's designs to return to Rome with a triumphant achievement for political advancement. Anyway the IX Legion (with Fassbender becoming supernumerary to) is ambushed and slaughtered, reminiscent to the to loss of Varus's legions in the black forest in 9 A.D this is important to understand in the end of the movie, But unfortunately it is never mentioned it would have given historical precedent and reference as we shall see later in my review. So the Legion is slaughtered in an complex ambush ( looking like scenes from the \\"Old Sparaticus\\" movie (Flaming Pigs) and \\"last of the Mohicans\\" (the valley ambush). There are seven survivors who under Fassbenders leadership set off to recover the very popular Legatus (Dominic West) who has been captured. They set of like a small \\"commando force\\" and sneak into the Picy hill fort and attempt to rescue the Legatus but are unable to because they are almost discovered. Then begins the great chase scene which stretches the duration of the movie in bone chilling scenery and bloody drama. It ends with a side bar budding romance between an outcast pict woman ( Imogen Poots) and the Centurion and the reality that in a case of mistaken identity at the then being constructed Hadrian's wall Leaves Fassbender's Character ( the narrator of the story)the sole survivor. Just when you think it is over the next and most diabolical twist is when the Governer aghast at the loss of the legion and the implication of the political and military disaster is portends tries to have fassbender's character eliminated.

031603438X|4.0|Reading Life was, for me, a fascinating experience.  During the first part of the book, I found Richards amazingly honest and non-defensive, about his drug use and his womanizing and his incredibly self-indulgent ways.  He didn't make excuses, and I found that very admirable.      Then the book, for me, took an ugly turn.  These are the chapters when Richards takes his 7-year-old son, Marlon, on tour with him.  It becomes Marlon's job to take care of Richards, who is unable to take care of himself.  Marlon witnesses the drug use and the womanizing, is responsible for getting Richards out of bed when no one else can do it, and subsists on a room service diet of cake and ice cream.  He has a hamburger only when Mick Jagger takes into his head to show a little kindness to the child.  Apparently Marlon doesn't attend school and he has no friends his own age.  Later, Richards deposits the child with the child's mother, who he knows is a junkie who can barely take care of herself, and who is living with her unstable, 17-year old lover.  When this young man commits suicide during a game of Russian roulette, Marlon sees the splattered brain matter against the walls.    Richards sees nothing wrong with this.  Marlon apparently turned out okay, he doesn't become a drug addict, and he has a good relationship with his father.      So it was hard for me to reconcile these two views I had of Richards.  On one hand, I admired his ability to look at his life with unflinching honesty.  On the other hand, I was disgusted and appalled by the criminal child abuse of a 7 year old child, especially when he had almost unlimited resources to provide a better life for the child.      Then I realized that there isn't much difference between these two views.  Richards doesn't make excuses for any of his behaviors because, as a famous rock star, he has never been held accountable for anything.  Others will make excuses for him.  And they do, constantly, including a blind girl (!) who shows upon the doorstep of a judge who is to sentence Richards and pleads his case for leniency.    The rest of the book, after the revelation, was fun in a different way, seeing how he could act without consequences or accountability, and how that turned him into a raging narcissist.  For instance, Richards never missed a concert but he was often late, sometimes by several hours, as he sleeps off the drugs.  He doesn't feel bad about this, because he always puts on a great show when he finally arrives.    Think this through.  I've been late for appointments before, sometimes 10 - 15 minutes late.  Inevitably that person indicates his or her annoyance with my behavior.  I feel bad and I apologize.  This is how normal life works.  Richards' life is a little different.  He keeps seventy thousand people waiting while he sleeps.  They don't leave, they don't demand their money back.  When he finally shows up, they don't express their annoyance.  On the contrary, they cheer.  And the narcissistic beast gets another meal.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Most headphones hurt my ears or head after I use them for a couple hours.  I have 2 pairs of these and I listen all day at work, then can go home and play video games for hours without noticing the headphones at all.  Sometimes I work I just put the headphones on to dampen noise.   Honestly, I tried probably a dozen headphones in the last 10 years, and these blow away the comfort of all others.   Furthermore, these last way longer than most other headphones of their size.  I usually break the band, or break off a cup, or (most often) the inline volume control.  I've had 2 pairs now for probably 2 years, and I just broke one of them for the first time (broke the extendable band).    The inline volume control on both still works and is not loose at all.  I'm kind of hard on headphones, and the other brands were lasting a couples months.  These lasted over 2 years.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|The day that I ordered this CD the song previews were not available. Had they been, I would have known immediately that this was not the Josh Groban that I loved.  I have every other Groban CD, and was excited that this one seemed to feature more songs in english, although I loved all his music.  I suppose that every artist wants to experiment with something new, but at least for me, it was a disappointment.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This is a good movie to own on Blu-Ray.  The visuals are crystal clear, and even more stunning during the IMAX portions.  And the extras are so numerous, I've just begun to scratch the surface of them.
B00006AUIG|5.0|Update June 30, 2011-    I was absolutely WRONG to dismiss Session 9.  For some really bizarre reason, in my original review I criticized Session 9 for not delivering with any terrifying fears (such as revealing ghosts and demons and whatnot in grand, dramatic style).  Well... my approach in watching Session 9 must have been completely messed up, and I definitely STRONGLY realize the error of my ways now.      I realize I wasn't attempting to get into this movie properly from the get go, and had my own assumptions how the storyline SHOULD have been done, when in reality Session 9 is an intelligently written horror film right from the beginning.  I shouldn't have been so quick to judge it, because doing so unfortunately enabled me to judge it unfairly.    In my original review I mention that the film had potential and \\"wasn't utilized properly or fully\\"... well, that was obviously a sign that, the night I watched it, I didn't have the appropriate attention span required in order to grasp the complexity of the way the plot develops.  Watching Session 9 again this afternoon, I realize it's an extremely well-written storyline.  The suspense *is* there after all, but if you don't take the time to carefully pay attention to the storyline and character development, you will miss over important portions of the movie that will undoubtedly end up leading to an unsatisfying experience overall.  I'm honestly kicking myself for misunderstooding the film as much as I did.  I mean, I was *really* off in my original review, and I'm not ashamed to admit it.      I originally complained that it took entirely too long for the \\"everyone loses their minds\\" aspect of the storyline to kick in, but the truth is, that aspect was definitely there from the beginning, and increases gradually until everyone eventually can't take the pressure and inner torment anymore.      So to sum up my updated and more accurate review- Session 9 *does* contain atmosphere, a perfect horror setting, and a well-written and highly creative storyline.  Perhaps watching it twice is exactly what I should have done in the first place, but you must understand, I've never had a movie increase in quality as drastically as this one simply by watching it twice.  This particular experience is all new to me.     I've noticed since I wrote my review last November, several more low ratings from recent reviews have been submitted to amazon.  Well, to me that means people need to watch Session 9 again.  Don't just assume it's a slow-moving storyline like I once did, and really take the time to pay exceptionally close attention to the characters.  Also, I believe Session 9 is a perfect movie for those who admire the Shining, the 80's horror classic.  Session 9 feels like it was based off that movie, so if you like the Shining, you simply MUST watch Session 9.    Anyway, here's my original review, which is honestly completely wrong, but I'll leave it here so you read through a reviewers misguided first impression. Here it is-      Session 9 isn't necessarily a *pitiful* attempt at a horror film.  More like, it had potential that wasn't utilized properly or fully.    The biggest number one problem is that for 75% of the film you're basically being teased into believing a dramatic terrorizing experience is going to be right around the corner and yet... it never happens.  At least, not how you'd expect.    The storyline is about a group of workers assigned on a quick deadline job to fix up an abandoned hospital where the mentally sick used to stay.      Now what's interesting (and I actually give the writers a little bit of credit for this) is that you're never sure just WHERE the storyline is going.  This can be a problem obviously because it's slightly confusing to follow, but it can also keep the viewers guessing.      Maybe I shouldn't speak for everyone, but I know *I* was definitely guessing just exactly how the horror would eventually be shown.  I was convinced some kind of ghostly spirit would come out of the walls or hallways and kill the workers one by one, but actually it was more like the abandoned hospital made the workers slowly but surely lose their minds.    Unfortunately it took *such* a long time for this crucial element of the storyline to take effect (at least an hour and 10 minutes of waiting) that I end up feeling cheated in the actual scares and disappointed in the overall film.    However if you've managed to stick with it for the first 45 minutes, you mine as well watch it till its conclusion.  At least the ending is a minor surprise.  It's not the biggest surprise in the history of horror, but I didn't see it coming so I'm glad I didn't turn it off.   This film desperately needed some atmosphere for me to recommend it though.  A regular day on the job with young men talking normally to each other isn't exactly the right environment for uncontrollable fear.
B001OQCV2E|4.0|With over 500 reviews no one will read this, but I had to at least give it 4 stars to raise the average a little so perhaps more will watch it. This was not a movie for someone dissecting it for scientific facts and reasons.  This film reinforces our knowledge/belief that if the world ends suddenly, it will be the rich cats and power mongers of the world that will buy their way out. (Which is stupid since what good is money in a world without governments.) So we have to save the politicians, businessmen and bureaucrats  And since it's a movie we have to have a hero who almost dies several times and will save a bunch of the poor working class. Sit back with some popcorn and the kids and just watch the story go by. BY THE WAY, his son learns to love him again, his ex-wife \\"new boy friend\\" dies and  she realizes she still loves him and comes back to him and they all live happily ever after in African and start a new world. Yea!!! LOL  I bought the movie and my kids have watched it twice...I did too.
B003JSSPSY|4.0|I know it is not like the books but...I enjoy the story lines, the characters and it is NOT A REALITY SHOW! To bad they canceled the show so abruptly.  At lease they should come back with an ending.  No escapism for a Sword and Sorcerer SciFi nut to go for a few TV minutes.
B0044KU7KU|5.0|Short review: the concept is very \\"comic book\\" you'll love it or hate it.  The songs are incredible.  After just 1 spin of this CD you'll have a couple favorites. By the time you've played it 3 or 4 times you'll love 'em all.      I was lucky enough to get an advance copy and it has been the only thing playing on my iPhone, car stereo, and home stereo for the past week.    If you love MCR you already have or have ordered this. if you don't love 'em, plunk down the $8.99 and add a GREAT rock album to your collection.    Terry  Raleigh, NC
B002VWNIAY|5.0|One of my very favorite movies! I was very pleased with the quality of the dvd, and the price was great!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|The beginning of the End: The first installment of the last HP novel is here... Easily the BEST of the film series adaptations. There was so much plot damage control to be done due to the copious story cuts on the previous films that it seemed impossible to make Deathly Hallows true to the text. But thanks to stretching this one to a 5 hour project and some character stacking rivaling a Dagwood sandwich, HP Vii part one, is a promising start.<br /><br />The cavalcade of cameos may make your head spin, but it serves to make Harry's story more whole and his quest to find and destroy Voldemort's splintered soul richer for it. Appearances i feared we would never have, like older Weasley brother Bill just in time for his wedding, and complete with werewolf scars. Another, belated introduction, new minster of magic Rufus Serimgeour, played Brilliantly by Bill Nighy (what a Doctor [Who] he would have made!) but oh so briefly, if only he had been in Order of the Phoenix. Also perfectly cast and missing from wayback, oily sneak thief Mundungus. The. Jar-Jar Binks of the wizarding world Dobby briefly returns. As does wandmaker Ollivander and goblin Griphook return. Dobby's appearance is much better than his first, although much impact is lost due to his absence from HP 4-6. But, as if to make up for this one of my favorite Dobby lines cut from Chamber of Secrets is sort of included in Hallows, \\"Dobby never meant to kill, maim, ...but never kill.\\"<br /><br />Let's not forget our title character and his faithful sidekicks, Watson, Grint and Radcliffe each really comes into there own as actors here as Hermionie, Ron & Harry. Especially Grint's superbly-done jealous Horcrux-weary Ron. The rest of the wizard staples are there, if very briefly, A  few stolen moments w/ Ginny, a brief hint at (hopefully) heroic things to come from less homely Neville Longbottom.  The Muggle staples: the Dursleys, are on screen so briefly the point of the appearance is lost, really there isn't the closure of the text or the film series there at all.<br /><br />The effects as always are great, no glaring problems like, the centaurs & trolls of Sorcerer's Stone. The Opening chase from Privot Dr. is proof that the visuals are solid enough as are subtler moments like the raising of the Wedding tents. The music by Alexandre Desplat(composed Benjamin Button and Fantastic Mr. Fox) is pretty good but, sadly not any real substitute for Mr. John Williams.<br /><br />One nice touch to watch for is the retelling of the tale of the Deathly Hallows at Luna Lovegood's home accompanied by shadowpuppets via CGI, lovely and dynamic.<br /><br />Beautifully shot, plenty of interesting location work, perhaps the only disappointing aspect, other than the fact that we must wait for the big finish in July, is the lack of Hogwarts in the story... But, in my opinion, this only serves to strengthen the feeling of vulnerability and hopelessness of the state of things... Readers know this potential disappointment however will be rectified in part 2.t or the film series there at all.

B0044KU7KU|5.0|Definitely the best CD of the year. I highly recommend it for all MCR fans, it might sound different, but it's totally them. It's such an awesome CD I love it.

B001EYU1VO|2.0|I bought this product because it seemed like a good starter stick for Microsoft Flight SIM. I find that the stick often looses contact with the base and I have to press down on it to regain contact.    I tried cleaning the contacts and its improved a little but now the right rudder is extremely sensitive and which causes loss of aircraft control on takeoff and landing - the most enjoyable part of flying.    In the future, I'd reccomend a higher quality product to take the frustration out of your gaming experience.

B0043KK4N6|5.0|This has to be one of the best sountracks of the past decade. Christina's voice is in top notch shape and even though I'm not much of a Cher fan, her performance on YHSTLOM is actually very good. Miss Aguilera dominates the soundtrack with eight of the ten songs and I really think she's found her niche in this retro sound because her voice is perfectly suited for it. The funky \\"Express\\", the soulful \\"Something's got a hold on me\\" and the surprisingly great remake \\"The beautiful people\\" are all stand-out tracks and she's nearly unrecognizable but brilliant on \\"I'm a good girl\\". If you're a fan of her back to basics album as I am, you'll love every bit of this soundtrack and as was stated by an earlier reviewer, if you love Christina in all her power house glory then \\"Bound to you\\" is right up your alley. Can't wait to catch the movie!
B0000CEB4V|5.0|One of the all time best concerts. I have viewed this dvd at least 20 times, and look forward to the next. Great show.
B000A3DFZE|4.0|As a fan of hell bent, ear splitting, raging guitar, I can certainly see why SOME people would think this isn't a fine production from Guitar God Eric Clapton.  But those people are 14 years old and wrong.  This is a fine CD, with a range of music on it, including Gospel, Reggae, Ballad, Good Ol' Rock 'n Roll etc.      It's quite clear from reading EC's book, and listening to this CD that Clapton has indeed found himself a Home he is comfortable with as a man, and that has led to his mellowing as a musician.  Don't get me wrong, I love Clapton's strung-out-I'm-a-junkie stuff the same as the next guy.  There isn't a piece on this CD with a guitar solo that holds a candle to the solo in \\"Badge\\" for instance, or \\"Crossroads\\".  There are however, some soaring moments where he rips it up pretty good, and I think every song on it is good...some even great.    Don't let the fact that you will NOT instantaneously love every note on this CD prevent you from buying it.  It is DEFINITELY his best effort in years.
B002A4Q652|3.0|Being a fan of bands like Lacuna Coil, Nightwish, and Evanescence, I was interested in giving another female-led metal band a try.  After my initial listen to this album, I have to say they sound rather bland and middle-of-the-road.  The music sounds okay and the singer has potential, but it sounds too much like she's minimized by the music and she doesn't really stand out.  There weren't really any tracks that reached out and grabbed me.  It's just okay.  Whenever their next album drops, I'll give them on more listen, but as of right now I'm not impressed.  Hopefully on their next album, they will stretch out and get more creative with their sound.
B004CZIQUA|5.0|This is a graduate course in law of attraction!  What a gift the author has given the world! This is much more than the SECRET and is a \\"how to\\" to bring goodness into your life.  It will change the way you think and feel about everything.

B0043KK4N6|4.0|The \\"Burlesque\\" soundtrack, accompanying the acting debut of singer Christina Aguilera, clocks only at some 33 minutes, but well summarizes what the star's singing is all about. Coming on the heels of \\"Bionic\\" album released earlier that year, the \\"Burlesque\\" bulk, inspired mostly by 1960's soul and swing, rather harks back to 2006, when Aguilera put out the acclaimed \\"Back To Basics\\" album.    The musical continues in the tradition of \\"Cabaret\\", \\"Chicago\\", \\"Moulin Rouge\\" (on which soundtrack Christina also co-performed the signature song \\"Lady Marmalade\\") and slightly also \\"Dreamgirls\\". The retro feel of the album suits the young diva's dynamic voice very well, even though some selections (among them a few remakes) lack lightness and feel a bit heavy-handed - a notable exception is the playful \\"But I am a Good Girl\\", where Aguilera's feline voice is in a complete different position and even many of her fans might have a problem recognizing her.    An antidote to Christina is the 64-year old Cher - lending the movie and the soundtrack a sleek nonchalance and class. She performs two songs on the album, making an impression of a guest star at a concert of a bigger one. While the truth is that the songs may end up as highlights of Cher's career post the 1998 smash \\"Believe\\", the problem may be that she did not record much since then and that the two new songs are her first new after seven years. So not much of competition there - \\"Welcome to Burlesque\\" is a sort of tango, while \\"You Haven't Seen the Last of Me\\", written by the still-ubiquitous Diane Warren, turns out to be a decent, even glossy, power ballad.    As for Christina, there are two tracks on the record that would definitely fit in to \\"Bionic\\"  - \\"Express\\" with its futuristic arrangement enveloping the conservative swing fare and the highlight \\"Beautiful People\\", spiced with hard guitar and indie riffs to an exhilarating effect, dwarfing the likes of Katy Perry or Pink. And if you still prefer balladeer in her, then \\"Bound to You\\" will definitely be your cup of tea.    The voice is there and the personality - almost - as well. The question remains whether \\"Burlesque\\" will become a classic. It can - if Ms Aguilera convinces film critics, too.
031603438X|3.0|Any one of these ratings is completely arbitrary, but even arbitrariness is taken some place other by this 'un. There are arguments about what he remembers, what he remembers accurately, whether any of it bears a passing resemblance to what actually happened, and even none of that discussion matters. For years I've thought of Jagger and Richards as the Abbott and Costello of decadence, and Keef does prove I might have been on to something. Or not. And what does that matter. In a culture obsessed with living vicariously through the achievements of sports figures, movie stars, rock and rollers, rarely does a mirror like this get raised, the white powder blown off, and the images through a glass darkly shine as an indication that the train of our sophistication and pursuit of the ephemera art suggests has left the station. Richards is a hoot, on and off a toot. In the NY Times this week, there's talk about how this book can be considered a management case study for surviving difficult partnerships.  Jayzuz.  I used to think it was only rock and roll and I liked it. That way. I haven't checked recently, but I'm near certain that a \\"Ponce\\" is someone, a poseur, who has gone off the rails and is convinced of his provenance. The good news here is that Richards does seem to indicate that through the fog he's caught sight of things and enddeavours you'd never in a million years associate with him. Good on ye, mate. Refreshingly, I suspect he gets the joke more than the rest of us.  So, if you'd like a real gut buster of a laugh and posibly an accurate perception on what it's like to be successful in spite of yourself, Richards delivers the goods. Maybe with this out of his system, he'll actually get fired up enough to deliver another Sticky Fingers.  But really, does it matter?

If you got it with the DVD then you know what I mean. If you don't have this CD, please make this a holiday purchase. You will NOT be disappointed. This CD is truly a great CD.

0060922583|5.0|I found out about this book from one of David Icke's books. The Holographic Universe is about the nature of Reality. It is scientific and if you liked movies like the matrix and the 13th floor...and want to know about reasearch in mysticism and OBE(Out of body experience = astral travel) and \\"miracles\\" this book is it! Actually there are so many experiments and research done in these aspects you would be surprised. Out of the 100s of books i have read on Spiritualism and quantum physics this is a MUST have. It is a bridge between the 2. This has got to be the best book on these subjects bridging the gap between the implicate and the explicate orders (material and spiritual worlds). The Holographic concept works and you will be experiencing reality in a new perspective. The book caused many astral trips for me! I had another me carry off to another place...i wont say more because many people have negative ideas about such experiences and call the hallucinations. Academic research is out there for you to look at and this book will lead you and tell you who to contact; institutions, healers, psychics, OBE schools....etc. I cant recommend it enough ! 7 stars all the way!!!!!!!!
0316172324|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a reputation of integrating researches and studies into his books. Blink definitely followed the same path.  The opening story of the Getty museum is compelling and leading to a question of the reliability of snap judgment or in the first two seconds.  Malcolm argued that the first two seconds is very important when it comes to making a decision. Too much information and data often overwhelm and cloud the real truth that he/she is looking for.              Though, the first two second rule does not always apply as Gladwell cautioned in his book which he called the Warren Harding error. Because human brains are pre-conditioned by individual experience, we often make our snap judgment based upon our past experiences whether or not we are conscious about it; so snap judgment can sometime be wrong and unreliable.              The conclusion of a good judgment as point out in his book is that experiences play an important role in order to be able to rely on one's snap judgment. People usually misinterpreted their own feeling and did not say what they really felt and it became a big problem when we started relying on a market research data that contains misinterpreted information of such group.               In time of overwhelmingly massive information at our fingertips, Blink is a great book that reminds us of our conditional snap judgment and the problem of too much information in making everyday decisions. It is a norm now before buying something that you have to google the product, read the reviews online, comparing the product with other choices and exhaust  any available information before deciding not to buy one. We spend too much time and read too much information that ends up clouding our thought and real feeling. Blink tells you to consciously listen to your intuitive, together with organized information; you will have the power of thinking without thinking.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This album has so many surprises! I'll try my best not to spoil them, but you HAVE TO HEAR the new album version of Runaway! I can't get enough of that track and Kanye has changed it up from the single version we all heard way back when. I'm gonna keep this review short. This is Kanye's best album because there are no filler tracks and you can tell a lot of effort went into each song. Blame Game is so haunting! Listen to that track with headphones to get the full experience. The effects that Kanye used in that song really help the message hit home. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do!
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I was anxious to purchase Josh Groban's latest CD \\"Illuminations\\". I even preordered it before it was released without hearing any of the samples and I must say that I'm very disappointed. What happened to the Josh Groban that made his 1st two CDs? I just finished listening to the whole CD and there doesn't seem to be any melody to his songs. It's like listening to opera. He should either go \\"classical\\" or go back to his melodic love songs that tell a story. I  understand he used to work with James Foster. Maybe it wouldn't be a bad idea to go back with him. Also I wish Josh would stick to ALL Engish songs on his CDs. I love to sing along with him on my 1st two CDs but not this one. From now on, I'll listen to the samples of his music before I purchase one or maybe just purchase individual songs. If his future CDs are like this one I'm afraid he's lost my interest. Sorry, Josh!
B001GCUNYO|4.0|Timing is everything as they say.  Having a daughter and just becoming a new father, I saw this movie.  Because of those facts, \\"Taken\\" hit a chord in my soul.  I believe if I saw this movie before I had any kids, I would've rated it 3 stars.  The movie is too perfect in setting up Liam Neeson's character to be sympathatic.  Also, he's overly protective which crosses into obsessive paranoia.  Anyway, this has got to be high on the Father's Day gift list for now.  It's fun and gratifying.  I've seen the non-extended cut on cable and the only difference is the extended cut has a bit more \\"oomph\\" in violence in key scenes which adds a lot to the character.  Get it dad.  You'll enjoy it.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|A great movie that you can watch over and over and it never gets old!  Great cast! The movie came quick and in great condition!  Very Happy!
B003X2O6KW|5.0|The album is strong from begining to end.The only thing that could have made it a classic was if he had added some newer hot blazing tracks.Everybody has pretty much heard the whole album which kind of took away from the anticipation of it.I would have like to seen some features that would have sparked peoples interest like Twista,Jaime Foxx,Game.Kanye's best music comes when he is motivated.
B00288KNL8|4.0|This is a Great movie that is fun and creepy!  But, the 3D didn't work very well, and the glasses  take most of the color out of the movie, it also   took a while to ship.Great in 2D!   Worth the price.Great color.Happy with it.
B003ELOQD4|2.0|I've been a U2 fan since the 80's, I've been to some of their previous concerts and I was much anticipating watching this show since the 360 tour will not hit my country up until next year.    I have to admit that I had this feeling, this not-really-good feeling about the whole thing. The album was pretty much a disappointment to me, but that I was ready for. I thought \\"hey, the album's a pretty weak one so they'll make it up to us with the tour.\\" But alas, they did not.     The editing leaves something to be desired, some of the takes look like they were not carefully planned, I'm not sure if the intention was to give the show an \\"edgy\\" feel or whatever but to me that did more damage than good, most of the time I failed at getting a sense of what was really going on up there. At least the sound was better than previous live performance releases.    The there's the band's performance itself. Don't get me wrong, I understand the guys are no longer in their prime but come on, Bono looks stressed, The Edge kind of struggles when he tries smile and look happy, Clayton was his usual self, and pretty much was Larry, but from watching the video I couldn't tell they were having a really good time. They all seemed to be just working, let's just get trough this, let's get done with it. If you've been to their shows, you know what I mean. I did not see that in this show, I did not see that connection, within themselves and with the crowd, that has bound the band together for so long.    The stage and its artifacts seem to be there to distract us from what's happening, there's not much aid from those elements to make it a better experience. Probably it's just the whole in-the-round thing. There's no band upfront, the members are scattered on a large area, maybe it's just too big, or the concert director intended to make it look that way. Of course some people will say they did the same thing with Popmart, but the Popmart performances were top notch, the stage was just that, thestage, not the main attraction.     Even counting the Burma and Iran things, there were no touching and/or special moments or some other things that got me. They did not play Bullet, they removed all feelings from Sunday Bloody Sunday, it was as if including the song was an afterthought. I'm all for rotating the setlist but if you're going to include Ultraviolet, do some justice to it, that's a magnificent track that was well underperformed, if you ask me.    The Unforgettable Fire was pretty much the highlight of the show for me.    Overall, I found this show to be one that I will not sit through again, but rather will have it playing on the background while doing some other thing. Like cleaning the house. And that's after having played a lot of other performances I own from U2 and other bands.    It just lacks soul.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|This album is undoubtedly album of the year. Kanye's creativity pushes bars that no other entertainer in music has reached. The production is flawless. If you love hip-hop, you will be pleasantly surprised with the production collaborations (RZA, Swizzy, and others). This album is definitely Kanye's redemption - I feel his blood, sweat, tears with this one. Definitely a classic. THANK YOU KANYE! HIP HOP NEEDS YOU.     Kanye was also generous to give my favorites as G.O.O.D Friday free downloads. He is changing the game one day at time. THANK YOU.   Must listen to   -   All the tracks are crazyy    Dark Fantasy - 10  Blame Game  - 10   All of the Lights Interlude - 10  All of the Lights - 9   Devil in A New Dress - 10  So Appalled - 10  Gorgeous - 9  Monster - 9   Runaway - 8  Hell of A Life - 10  Lost In The World - 8  Who Will Survive in America - 8  Power - 10          This album further concludes that Kanye is the best out right now.   This album is a masterpiece -
B0044XV3QY|5.0|what else can be said that Senor Zoidbergo did already say?<br /><br />I enjoyed the extra 15 minutes that seemed like longer to me. it was interesting seeing the Na'vi destroy the vehicles that destroyed their trees. in the original version they never did, which made the humans all that more ruthless,<br /><br />with the aireal shot of Jake and Neyteti hunting on Ecrans it made it more \\"Dances with Wolves\\" then ever before,<br /><br />the begining of the extended cut, n Earth, gave you a feeling of what Jake was telling us about how we \\"killed our  Mother\\" was all about<br /><br />I would enjoy this movie even if  it were 5 hours long, the blu ray aspect made it all that much more beautiful. I have no intentions of watching a 3D version as I am blind in my right eye and won't be able to enjoy the effects, so this is the version i am going to be most happy with
0553805371|4.0|I will join the flocks here on Amazon, who claim, that this book delivers little new information and answers preciously few questions. It is, in other words, not the right book for the advanced student of astrophysics. If you are well read in general science, I suspect this book might make only a slight addition to your library, but still a worthwhile addition, though. It sums up and explains the basic history of scientific theories of the world and all. It goes on to postulate, that the answer to all of our big questions lies in M-Theory, but tells very little of the actual answer. It only tells us from which direction to expect the answer to come, so to speak.     It is, however, well written, and if you are new to popular science or just starting out in physics, this is a good book. It is written with humour and talks to you, not down to you, which, I think, is no little effort considering the material under treatment. The book had a lot of big press surrounding its release, mainly because of the author's fame and authority, and a lot of expectations to go with it. The phrase \\"no God was needed to create the universe\\", seems to have been taken to be the ultimate statement of this book, and, it seems, a lot of people were expecting this book to be proof of God's non-existence. It isn't, of course. If, however, the book had been presented for what it is, a summing up and introduction to the scientific exploration into the biggest of all questions, it would have been much more well received by the reading public.    All in all not an advanced book delivering all the answers we so crave, but a good general book on the ongoing attempt of science to explain all the whys, wherefores, and gee wizs of us, the universe, and everything.
