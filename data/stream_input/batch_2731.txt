B007VTUYWW|5.0|Angelina Jolie is awesome in this movie and it is rated PG.  The kids enjoyed it as well.  She is our she- hero!!!
0670026557|5.0|Excellent reading. Helped to clarify some of my thoughts, but created new ideas; good !<br />Would buy book again in the future.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am a newcomer to Downton Abbey and I have watched all 3 seasons in only a few weeks. Eagerly awaiting season 4!
0064409422|5.0|When four English children are sent off into the country to escape the London blitz, they find themselves housed with an unusual host: an introverted professor who lets them explore the entire house freely and does not seem to notice long absences. This masterpiece of fantasy has long since passed into the respected realm of Children's Classics, despite its multiple protagonists and decidedly Christian overtones.<br /><br />Lucy, the youngest Penvensie, is the first to push through the back of a disused wardrobe to discover a land of enchantment and adventure beyond the lamp post where the forest ends. Or starts. Summoning her skeptical brothers and sister she urges them on to explore the surprise world. They encounter many rare creatures on their journey, though no other humans like themselves: sons of Adam and daughters of Eve, as they are called. Besides normal animals they meet oversized animals that speak, plus all manner of mythological creatures--humanoid and animal.<br /><br />But they have arrived at a critical time for Narnia: the White Witch, who embodies quintessential Evil, has cast a spell which prevents the arrival of Spring. Narnia lies frozen in eternal winter unless four rulers from another realm can save the innocent Narnians. She rules by fear thanks to her vicious wolf servants, but also by sly trickery on naïve boys. What hope is there for the gentle faun, Mr. Tumnis, and the homely but brave Beavers? There is only one who will help the four siblings to achieve feats of bravery, who provides both inspiration and practical help in the form of unique weapons for the final battle--as well as the ultimate example of self sacrifice. Aslan--the mighty lion lord of Narnia, will live to rule and roar for justice once more! But are Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy trapped in this land: how will they return to wartime Britain? The book itself proved a literary wardrobe and gateway into an entire realm of fantasy---spawning some seven books in all. The NARNIA chronicles proved a series which has charmed the world and captivated the imagination of children of all ages. Most readers become instantly hooked on NARNIA and its never-ending creativity.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|This album requires that you listen to it in one complete setting....it rewards patience and repeated play..so listen and enjoy.
B008M4OYYY|4.0|I got this for my nephew's birthday as he loves these nanoblocks. I have not given it to him yet but I am sure it will look great just like the other ones he has already built.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Action and funny.  A real farce and the action was wonderful and the cast was great.  Good to see Red before you see Red 2.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I played it a lot until I got word games to play ... I will probably go back to it because it is good eye exercise.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love the games that I find on facebook and the updates from my friend and the reminders of the birthdays too
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read but long. Got stagnant in the middle but quickly progressed. Overall I enjoyed all three books and would recommend them to anyone.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I love this show. I'm a law student and at first I thought this show would be really annoying, but it's so entertaining. I love the whole cast.
B0086700CM|2.0|It just goes too fast for me ... I haven't been able to get past the first level.  I have played games like this before and reached high levels but this one just moves too fast.  WOuld not recommend it based on my experience with it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Despite some errors, it's a great story. I enjoyed it more than the first book. Left me dying to read the third.
B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Some 3D movies are great 3D movies, but they are so boring that I can't stay awake. If your going to buy only one 3D movie, buy this one. I'm glad that I did.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I love this pad a friend had one and that's the reason I got one works great and easy to configure.
B008602KQI|5.0|It is almost as good as the book : ))  With Jennifer Lawrence, what is not to like ?  Read all the books and Lawrence does a great job.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Loved the story...was able to watch it with my 4 year old grandson and 9 1/2 year old granddaughter...we all loved it!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|A really fine film' with fine acting and great effects to animate and propel a fine plot that presents characters with real depth.  I was riveted.  I honestly don't understand why movies like this do not win the top awards for screenwriting, direction, acting, etc.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Awesome. Wish I had found it sooner. It is so worth 2.99. Get one now u won't regret doing it.
B009NFHF0Q|2.0|I am a huge Neil Gaiman fan and have always been riveted from the first page. I must confess that I am struggling to get past the first few chapters.
B002UJIY70|3.0|There was nothing really new here but Timothy Olyphant gives a good performance and it's worth watching just for the scenery.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This has to be my favorite game of all. I can upgrade my items. This is the one game I keep coming back to play so I can earn more coins, complete daily challenges,  and missions.
141659521X|5.0|Good book.  I like all of Flynn's books. Keeps  you guessing. So sad he has passed away!  He was an excellent writer!
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Some of this book was really good but it did not keep my attention like I thought that it would.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|The reader can get a little frustrated with Harold at times, but this is a story worth reading.  All the characters are  interesting and they held my interest.  The ending is somewhat unpredictable and it fueled contemplation about things that I could apply to own life.
B00BB8VSXS|5.0|great movie shows what love really is about and keeping your family together no matter what even giving your life to keep them safe.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. It gets frustrating when you realize your gems are decreasing quickly lol.  Why does the game have to keep running while you are away though?
B0063IH60K|5.0|This Solitaire game has ads, but it is a great app for being free and works perfectly on Kindle Fire HD.
B000JCSBU0|4.0|This movie is different.  It either makes you want to or never want to drugs.<br />This was movie about drug and the messed up lives they create.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really like this game. It is a little hard to get used to, and you have to unlock everything. But it is really fun and I would recommend it to people.
B008OOYALE|4.0|this was a fun waste of time. I enjoy unlocking and completing the new challenges. the design of the different dragon species is fun and creative.
B007X70NVO|5.0|Don't know much about MotoGP, but this film grips you, and humbles you.<br />Definitely gained a better appreciation for true speed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game so much. The unicorn is soooo fluffy. I can't put it down. Just wish it saved it the last spot you left off at
B0063IH60K|2.0|I can't figure out how to end a game even when there are no more plays left.  There isn't much help or direction.
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Purchased this dvd to add to our collection of horror movies. great product & great price. We had already owned ARMY OF DARKNESS, and bought EVIL DEAD 2, my husband purchased EVIL DEAD some time later. This dvd is cheesy, suspenseful, and scary all at the same time. Great trilogy! Thanks.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is possibly one of the greatest games I've played on my Kindle Fire. The game is challenging enough to keep me playing for hours to try to beat my latest score and the graphics are phenomenal. Helps kill boredom too.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love playing this game but there is one thing I would change. Start up takes a while  due to past goals that have been completed or ads. Please fix. It gets annoying when trying to cook or collect tips. As much fun as I have playing this game, that is a major turnoff.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy the game to pass time traveling.  It is easy and progressess to more difficulty.  Fun game to play.
B004SIP9E2|5.0|I am happy with this dvd, as always it was brand new at a great price on Amazon. We had purchased Scary Movie 2 a while back and could not find part 1 in stores that sell dvds, found it on Amazon. Thanks.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|I love it when artistis don't write one or two songs worth listening too, and phone in the rest. This is a complete album. She conveys an array of emotions and proves that her vocal chops are far greater than many of her contemporaries. I don't know anyone who wouldn't enjoy this.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm a huge Jane Austen fan and after watching my favorite version of Pride & Prejudice for the millionth time ([[ASIN:B00364K6YW Pride and Prejudice (Restored Edition)]] - only one worth watching, by the way!) as well as re-watching all my other Austen films (if you want another well done Austen flick, watch [[ASIN:B002XTBE6K Emma (2009 BBC Version)]] with Jonny Lee Miller)......<br /><br />Anyway, long story short...I felt it was time to check out another love story. My husband was very sweet and purchased this DVD for me knowing I was after a suitable P&P replacement.<br /><br />OH.<br />MY.<br />GOODNESS!!!!<br /><br />All I have to say is BUY IT!!! if you love the delicate & heartfelt romances from this era. I didn't think it possible for any film to come near my beloved P&P, but N&S is easily the best contender! You will LOVE LOVE LOVE the last scene...Mr. Thornton (Richard Armitage) OWNS the role! Trust me, watch it and you'll know what I'm going on about.<br /><br />Happy romancing!! :)
B000FBFM9S|4.0|moved along  kept my interest would recommend as a good book club book for discussion  am planning on reading more by zadie smith
B00006FDCD|3.0|I purchased this dvd for my husband. He seemed to be pleased with the product and I was pleased with the price. I have never and probably never will watch the whole dvd, this movie ruined me on clowns. I saw part of this movie several years ago and it scared me too death. I am still to this day afraid of clowns.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|For someone that is attempting to understand near death experience than this is the book to read.  It is written so well that anyone will be able to understand what he went through.
1932100660|5.0|Two bad our medical institution doesn't do a little more investigation into health.  They might learn something.  Also people might be a little more healthy.  I like the book.  Nicely written, and credible.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I own about 6 billion moleskines (read 24) which although lovely takes up a lot of space in my bookcase. this app helps me organize my drawings and ideas in an expedient &amp; orderly fashion without having to go out &amp; buy more journals. saves time, space &amp; money.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I liked it. It had decent puzzles but I want more advanced ideas that involve Multi layer puzzles. Still it was fun and worth playing.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Great but not as climactic as the previous book. The story is so rich with so many characters. Love it
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My grandson plays this game, and he really loves it.  He plays it each time he comes over the house or we are around each other, and he gets my phone to play on it.<br /><br />Rhonda
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the graphics on my kindle fire. It's something fun for the whole family to play not just the kids. They did a great job on this one!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Good app for using Twitter on the Kindle. Its even better than the android twitter app in my honset opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it's a very diverse app with lots of options. anyone is sure to find at least one game they love.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I'll make this short:<br />The author is a very talented woman. I wouldn't mind reading another of her works. But there are some things that keep me from giving it five stars. First she doesn't play fair. It's a murder mystery for god's sake. The author is not supposed to lie to her readers, but she does for a large part of the book. Second, there ought to be some characters that the reader cares about. By the end I didn't really care who got killed, with the possible exception of Boney, the female cop.<br /><br />As for what fundamental truths one can find in this book, there is only one: if you marry someone much smarter than yourself, you will never get bored. You may grow to hate her, however.
B00DGMVC4C|5.0|I had the first Sparkle game and enjoyed it, so when I saw this available, and read the reviews, I picked it up also.<br />My wife and I both love the game, immensely I might add. Parts of the game are challenging, but not too hard, and are excellent for casual play: very relaxing, almost Zen in quality,. but when that pales, other parts are harder, and can get very hard, but still fun.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Awsm show! Pretty close to the comic as one could expect for TV. Watch if you like comic book shows
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Can't get enough of Gideon he is amazing!!!! Love this series can't wait for the rest!!!!! Sylvia is an amazing writer makes you look forward to each page... Hard to put down...Need more Gideon so bad... Never enough Gideon I will be very upset when it is over.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|One of my favorite series ever. Truly love reading Brandon Sanderson. Would recommend this series to everyone. Loved the characters.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love this show and can't wait to watch season 5 and the upcoming 6th! The stories are great as is the cast
B002BI6SMI|2.0|not sure why so many people like this movie.  cheesy dialogue and premise. don't waste your time and money. Thumbs down.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is one of my absolute favorites and should probably come with a warning for addiction.  If you don't already have it....  Get it!
B008CPZNL6|3.0|it freezes and acts up too often to be a pleasant experience. it get very annoying if they can fix that i'll give it 5 stars.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Game has great graphics. Bought it for relaxing play during summer vacation and have enjoyed the challenge.  The hidden object puzzles have zoom feature which I really like.
B00DJUPLY8|4.0|sees to work fine for various file types<br />would recommend this to someone needing<br />to play video that others wont open or play
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is probably one of the best free games that I own. Initially I thought that it would be just the same as subway surfers but this game is so much better. Did I mention that it is FREE!!!!!
B00BI73CVI|4.0|I enjoyed the movie but enjoyed the actual play more. I liked the acting and the singing but I would have liked there to be less singing and more talking.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|Interesting and somewhat sad story with a twist ending. We can only hope he knew...everyone has impacted others lives at some time, and this story illustrates that fact vividly.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Meh. Needs better instructions. But what do online gift you Inuit difficulty iugccihgcityciugciyuck. B-) ok Christopher Hitchens the places rn adolescent
B0029EDMEG|5.0|This movie was well written and wisely directed. The cast I thought was put together wonderfully. This movie was enjoyably entertaining.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|Great tv show love all if seasons. Will watch all of the seasons again and again. can't wait for the next season.
B00571F26Y|4.0|I appreciated the recipes that helped put the information into action. Will test it out and see how it goes!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I thought it was great ! The graphics are amazing ! I am a horse CRAZY girl so as soon as I saw this I went CRAZY!
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|It doesn't work in my kindle fire hd. Whenever I press on the camera or video icon, it just keeps on crashing. I can only take pictures when it is in extended version. Please fix this.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|A classic and fun movie for kids as well as adults! Might be scary for kids under 6 or so!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I really like this show. It has great characters and wonderful sets. It really gives the viewer a sense of what it was like in England before the major trappings of the Aristocracy went away.
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Johnny Depp,  Mary Stuart Masterson and the rest of the actors present a touching view of people with challenging personality traits. They are presented with dignity, respect and compassion. This movie depicts an example of how we need to respect each other.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|This is the first book by Lee Child that I have read. My dad said I would like it. He was right. It reads fast & kept me reading every chance I got. Jack Reacher is an excellent character. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good solid story with some twists to it and great dialogue.
B00A8MGLAI|2.0|Very disappointed,turned off half-way.Story jumped all over and couldn't get a grasp of where it was going.I don't know if I'll even try to return to see the finish.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice.  Very Challenging and fun very creative and easy to get hooked on for hours an  hours ,more levels please you guys rock
B002ELIXCA|5.0|Dexter is about as creative as it gets with respect to television, and it just works. The personalities, the wit and the subject matter are all riveting.  Don't miss it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had heard about this show from several friends and family and when I saw all of the first 3 seasons on Amazon Prime, I couldn't resist giving it a try.  I watched all 3 seasons in 3 weeks.  Can't wait for season 4!
B0060MYM3S|4.0|Excellent,storyline,close to the book. Only problem I have is with disc one.Bad scratch on disc is to deep and player has difficulty correcting it. Tried another player and it is a lttle better.Waited to finish book before inspecting,I won't do that again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|And still I love it!  Still it is hard to put down each time!  Still I am amazed at the characters and the challenges!  This book is amazing!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Very funny, hints of &#34;Best in Show&#34; comedy. If you love a capella singing this movie is the best out there.
B00821OX98|4.0|This is a great scfi story, was good to see the story developed as it went along. Giving birth to room for an expanding story. loved watching every episode.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book was interesting in that it increased my awareness of the depth and range of feelings that cancer patients experience. This author drew me in, involved me, and wouldn't let me go until we reached a satisfactory ending together. At times, I hated the story but  I  couldn't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun but doesn't update a lot because I still have the Paris edition. But the game is still worth it. GET IT!!!!
B00DYVUBYM|5.0|Let me start off by saying that this movie is quite obviously not for everyone. It has long boring sequences of teens talking and having a great time. This is entertaining to some. I found it quite interesting because of the fact that teens actually behave this way. At least The Bling Ring did. There were scenes when you would just wonder why it was drawn out this long. Why they showed them robbing a house for this long or showing them just basking in their glory. Showing them partying with the money, clothes, and jewelery stolen from all those celebrities. But hello? This is exactly what you're expecting from a movie like this. What else did you want to see? Just a warning before you read the IMDB or Rotten Tomato reviews. However if you always wondered why people love pop culture and wonder why people obsess over celebrities than this movie is for you. It quite simply tells why.<br /><br />Watson plays a California teenager who's thirst for expensive and luxurious things is just the one thing that stands out about her character. Her character is loosely based off of one of the actual robbers in the Bling Ring, Alexis Neiers. She portrays her great. Even though throughout the movie you'll try to listen for Watson's British accent. The movie will be nothing but boring for people who are not interested in this subject or even interested in the true story about the The Bling Ring robbers. However, if you are interested in the facts about our society's fascination with pop culture then you should definitely watch this movie. The acting is great and who doesn't like to leave their life for a moment and live in the glamor?<br /><br />I like to think of this movie as almost a parody of teen life. However, the fact that these specific teenagers actually acted this way is just funny and amazing to me. It's almost hard not to laugh, but also hard not to sit and realize that this is actually sad. These teens committed a felony crime by stealing millions of dollars worth of clothing and jewelry from human beings who are well known in our world. The movie ends with a sense of justice in after seeing all the good consequences of their actions it also showed equally the negative consequences of their actions. However funny this might be to some, I like the way Sophia Coppola doesn't ignore the fact that this is wrong and disturbing, but than again they are just teenagers having \\"fun\\" which doesn't justify their actions but rather explains them. In a way I agree with Emma Watson in her interview that this is kind of a political movie, but I also disagree with her when she says that it's not a parody because it is.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Do not understand why this terrific show only lasted 2 seasons. Okay, maybe the drama was a little much, and there were a few detestable characters, but there were also several wonderful characters, and the musical numbers were first rate. I really liked the way they transitioned back and forth on some of the numbers, from &#34;in the moment,&#34; to full scale productions. Kathryn McPhee and Megan Hilty were both standouts, both so extraordinary that I couldn't decide which one I liked best. Some of the original songs made for the series should become standards.
B008HK3XOU|4.0|We have been married 59 years. and I thought she would like a case for her new Kindle.  She loves it, because it protects her Kindle, and I like it, because the price was right.  She picked the color red.  { I think it's because it is easier to find in that big purse of hers!}  Oh well. she's happy, I'm happy, and Amazon should be over joyed!  Curt, AKA Great Grandpa 16 times...........
B00E00OGE2|4.0|Like [[ASIN:B00CWM58WY Epic]] meets [[ASIN:B005ZMUQCK Cars]]. The odd kid out (Theo, a snail) has grand ambitions (car racing). Kind of predictable - a miracle transformation, vast odds, within inches of failure, stunning success, acceptance back home once he's proven himself. Plus a similar tale of redemption for his business partner. (If you think this is a spoiler, you need to see more movies.)<br /><br />OK. you've seen it before, but your kid hasn't. Fun characracters, quality animation, excitement without being too scary (but you know your little one best), and pretty tolerable for the grownup buying the tickets. Three stars for you, five for the kid, I'm giving it four.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B0043ZDU1E|4.0|A good album.  As always her voice and the musical arrangements are top notch.  I love this woman's voice and the instrumentals behind her are great.
B0027ZCQ4E|4.0|The movie started the whole bourne series. Movie, true to the story, is well made. overall streaming was good and HD quality. the whole bourne series is good. Bourne Supremacy is the best movie in the series.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Anyone who wants an interesting show to get hooked to should watch this! A definite must! The actors are perfect for their parts!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun to race the minions and try to get the banana's and being able to use a minion launcher.  I like completeling the tasks that they have for you to do.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|This is a great live performance, and as always her vocals and arrangements are perfection.  This is my favorite Loreena McKennitt album among a bunch of great albums.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but felt compelled to in this case. My hat's off to Mr. Johnson for the sparse, yet elegant, descriptions. He quickly paints pictures that pull you right into the scenes.  And the snarky humor?  I must confess that I woke my wife up several times laughing out loud.<br /><br />I was hooked on the A&E series and now I am home on the books. I'll definitely be reading each one and wishing I was living in Wyoming.<br /><br />Kudos Mr. Johnson.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I viewed at a request of a friend.  It didn't make me jump, but it was Okay.  I probably wont see it again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love to make houses and be able to have different animals.  I would highly recommend this game for anyone.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics in this game are amazing great fun for all to play no matter what there age kids and adults can have fun playing this game
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I would recommend this movie to everyone.  My kids loved it.  It has been watched numerous times and still loving it.
B0092S4WLY|4.0|Hard enough that I had to think the first time through. Easy enough that my 4 year old could do it with some assistance. I wish there were more levels.
B00DU74U74|1.0|This film was so awkwardly structured and abysmally acted that it was hard to believe that the producers and director had ever seen a movie before, let alone made one. Yes, I read the book and yes the story is weak - but its hard to imagine a worse conversion of the written material to film. The main character is supposed to be over a thousand years old - but none of that maturity is ever present in this poor under-talented actress's delivery of a single line. She doesn't even come across as a character old enough to be the battle hardened teen that she was supposed to have been before being taken by the alien parasite. &#34;Plan 9 from Outer Space&#34; is a better film - go watch that one and at least be entertained by how little sense it makes instead of being bored to death for the same reason.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the best game ive ever played. I need to play more games. I love me some minions but I still cant find el macho.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|This has always been a favorite movie in our house.  I would recommed this movie to everyone.  Had to purchase the movie so kids can watch on their ipad and kindle fire.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|So the Chromecast came to my office today (Amazon is always best on shipping). Within 5 minutes it was setup (go to webpage or app). Within 10 minutes of getting it we had 5 different devices connected and casting to it (iphone, s2, HTC Dna, Chromebook Pixel, and Mac Mini). Everyone on the same network as the Chromecast can see it and control it (not just the person who started it). We took turns adding our next youtube clip, Google Play song, or Netflix show. Seemless integration between switching content from all different devices.<br /><br />This is a game changer and apps are stupid to not jump on this bandwagon. Thank you google for once again innovating at a LOW price point!
B0021L8V0W|5.0|The woman can act when she wants to.<br /><br />I applaud all the work she does for children throughout the world.
B009WUBERW|3.0|No its not exactly going to win any oscars, but it accomplishes what it sets out to.  Its got a great cast, some good jokes, and about 3 movies worth of ridiculous action sequences.  You won't find a more testosterone packed film than this. Although the Fast and Furious movies would give it a run for the money...
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This EP is so good.  I Can't wait for more.  Listen to Royals real loud.  You will not be disappointed.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable Me: Minion Rush is so fun!! Its really addicting and I originally bought this game for my 2 year old twins Penelope and Sebastian. But I'm pretty sure I play it more than they do! I hope my opinion was helpful in every way possible for you. God Bless!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed solving the puzzles. I have played every free minute for the last two days! I would recommend to anyone who likes solving puzzles.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is a good game.I teaches kids how to take care of a horse.well I like this game.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|John Malkovich was a riot and Helen Mirren was great! The movie kept me entertained from beginning to end!  I was never bored.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|best way to fight sleep disorders is to get into the right state of mind with this app. helps with finding your inner peace.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This Game is Good, but it seems too easy. I think the problem is that you need more Hostile and neutral mobs in survival and creative. You should also be able to spawn Mobs other than Peaceful mobs. Plus there should be an ACTUAL nether, not just a room made out of netherrack and 3 zombie pigmen.<br />Some mobs that can add popularity to minecraft are:(In Popularity order)<br />1. Enderman<br />2. Wolf<br />3. Ghast<br />4. Blaze<br />5. Bosses(ex. Enderdragon)<br />6. Snow Golems<br /><br />These are most of the mobs that will make the game more fun and challenging.<br />You should also have a superflat world option.
B005LN5UOC|1.0|uncomfortable to wear. Really bad sound quality. I know its a blue tooth but the voice through the ear piece is really muffled. Ive had the EX01 and the EX02 the sound was awsome.
B003E48AYC|1.0|I love this movie and when I saw that it went on sale I jumped at the chance to purchase it. I received it in the mail yesterday and the packaging looked like it had gone through the ringer and then every disc had bubbles and scratches all over them. I was really disappointed.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Was very fun to play and quite addictive. The abilities werre very interesting and I would highly suggest this game.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I hope that the sequesl is as good as the first one. HIghly recommended for people who likes action movie.
B00C7L8DM2|1.0|The trailer makes it look interesting, but I really should have looked at Rotten Tomatoes before I rented this movie.  Twenty-eight percent positive reviews... It looks and feels a bit like The Bourne Identity, but without any of the mystery,  suspense or romantic tension. Once it was revealed what is actually happening (maybe a third of the way through the movie?), I got distracted by something on my phone and then proceeded to shop for pencil sharpeners online for about 20 minutes. That was much more exciting.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|This movie is basically in the vein of the later Resident Evil film franchise, especially the later entries. Lots of action, silly dialogue, little plot. Some twists and turns that you could see a mile away and an ending that leaves you going, &#34;saw that coming.&#34; It fullfilled what I needed from it though and surprised me with the language and gore. I assumed this was a kiddy flick with action but was taken aback by head stomps and skull crushes. The witches featured in the film were beautifully designed but you'll rarely see them. Also, Jeremy Renner is playing Hawk Eye in this flick. Has he already been type cast?
B00CLD65X0|5.0|First of all, I was quite shocked that the name of the show is NOT &#34;DownTOWN Abbey&#34;- it's DownTON(pronounced like 'fountain') Abbey. It took no more than one episode to make a devout fan out of me. The show is just 100% GOOD. A real, solid quality. The storylines are involving;the actors are fantastically talented;the setting and the costumes are authentic-looking. I became very involved with the characters and I feel VERY concerned with each event's effects on the different members of the estate. This show truly stirs deep emotions in its viewers; I'm absolutely SURE of it!  I have done it all:cried,tears were actually STREAMING down my face!;laughed;felt fear and dread;TRIUMPH-  you name it, I felt it as I clung to the edge of my seat during several episodes of this brilliant series. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!
B001609SQA|4.0|My husband described this movie to me--out of the blue (he's the worst at actors and voices and faces)--but thankfully, between Amazon's and my description--he and I were able to figure out which version of Alien he wanted to see. He says this is the best, and I'm pretty ready to agree with him. I mean, I like Winona Rider, but where is *she* is the ALIENS timeline?
1609611543|5.0|I am a 39 year old man and have worked out fairly consistently for 20 years.  I have run two full marathons and a handful of half-marathons and other races.  I currently run about 10-15 miles per week, and also do weights & calisthenics.  Since reading this book around six months ago and eliminating wheat from my diet, I have lost around 7 pounds (of fat) without any increase in exercise.  My weight is now lower than it's been in a decade, and that includes when I was at the peak of my marathon training and running 40 miles per week. I'm starting to get my six pack back, which has been MIA for...I'm ashamed to say how long. I buy a lot of stuff on Amazon.com, and don't always give reviews.  But I think this is the best purchase I've made on this site, and felt compelled to speak up about it. If you are interested in fitness and staying healthy, I highly recommend that you give this book a look.
B00DHNBPA6|4.0|The movie rushes by at a quick pace, and the red stuff flies everywhere, literally pouring from the sky. It's not as campy as the original, but its more gross then scary. The initial set up with the addict angle was nicely done even if it took a little too long for some characters to get out of denial over what was really going on. The acting was fine for what needed to be done, but the effects are what shine. Nasty impalings with a nailgun, limbs being hacked off, a grizzly scene where a face is sliced with broken glass. The final act differs the most from the original and while its graphic and nasty, it depends on the viewer how you'll take it. Fortunately for the filmmakers I loved it and I'm eager to see how they will continue the franchise if they choose to.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I agree with all Shery is saying.  I know it has been true for me during my education and in my worklife.  I wish I was younger and could now go out and apply / practice all Sheryl has identified.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Okay, so first off, I kept watching the show. I liked the premise and characters enough to want to keep going.....but man, some of the scenes in this series (especially early on) were kind of hard to get through. The acting almost always felt forced from not one, but all of the main characters. The only exception might be the scenes with the Doctor getting angry, those were the times I most believed him as a character. Everyone else....meh. I am happy to report that the production and acting quality got much better in season 2, though I do miss Christopher Eccelston. They all say you always like your first Doctor the best. :)<br /><br />Point is, don't give up on the show due to the extremely cheesy acting (and writing) in this season. It does get better, push through!
B000FBFMIO|5.0|This is my favorite of all robin’s series! She does terrific character development. Good story.i have read the lot of them twice.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story! Great acting! Fast paced and really totally addicting - could not stop watching.  I would recommend to anyone.
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I love Queens. And hearing Josh on the Nerdist podcast not wanting to talk about the album but just wanting to hang out with the guys and talk was awesome. He is a very funny guy and I'm not sure why they haven't had him host SNL yet but...he's probably too busy touring.<br />Anyway, every song on here is amazing. My only quibble is the extra stuff at either the beginning of a song or the end. I'm not down with all the frills, just give me the music. It worked on Songs For The Deaf but here, it's annoying. I just used an MP3 editor and cut the stuff out. Either way, loving this album and it's currently the only thing I've been listening to for the past few weeks.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This is well done horror that delivers! It is well written and I couldn't wait to see the next episode.
B000F4RHB6|5.0|I have this cassette and love it!!  But I thought I'd purchase the CD instead of trying to record the cassette.
B002ZG99TA|5.0|WHITE KNUCKLE THRILLER GREAT IN GROWING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LEADS WASHINGTON DOES HIS USUAL GREAT JOB AS DOES NEW TO ME PINE
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very interesting story line and good character development.  An adult read but an enjoyable one. Very descriptive. Would recommend this book to others.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|Character driven, obviously, and full of the 20-something angst that marked my generation. When it could be entirely self-indulgent, it's actually quite captivating and charming.
B004WE01YA|5.0|Disney did a great job with this movie - one of their best! Love the multiple format and the ability to watch on iTunes with the digital copy!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing , I love it I am 17 and my cousin is 21 and we can't stop playing it , it's just amazing , the only thing I don't like is that I can't update it and my cousins that play it in their Apple devices the game is up to date and they play against the Macho and I can't
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game on my kindle fire I recommend getting this game. My most favorite game on my kindle is this game
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was such a lovely book. It takes you into the mind of a different kind of teenager and you learn to view life from another person's perspective. Especially recommend it for those in the their teen years.
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|Considering it's free, this is a fun game. You can actually win and progress without buying something.  The scenario never changes though,  so it can get boring.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|An amazing show. I watch this on Amazon Prime; I gave up on cable a few years ago but this show almost makes me want to go back to it....NOT!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Amazing movie that was so enjoyable on our 3D Sharp television.  Our family loved the experience and we are looking forward to purchasing more 3D movies on Amazon.
0345525558|3.0|It was a good story. However, the author frequently switched back and forth between the present and the past. The way she did this was frequently confusing. The story was more serious than I had anticipated. I am not fond or romance literature and the fact that I finished the book is a sign that it was better than most.
B002EDH0FE|2.0|Having heard so much about the comic, I was very disappointed to find the movie so blah.  I was glad when it was over.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is so good that you CANNOT wait to watch the next episode. The acting and writing are superb. Although the lead characters acting is excellent, I think that Rich Hoffman steals the show.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I'm 32 and I LOVE TVD!!  Although, Season 3 was my least favorite season, but I cannot recommend it enough!  Everyone I work got hooked too!
0385523394|5.0|So I bought the book can't wait to finish it! I love piper she is an amazing person. Can't wait for the next season either
B001XUH69Y|5.0|We saw this for the first time quite recently and afterwords both my wife and I were absolutely astonished with 1) how great this movie is and 2) how we had both managed to go so many years without seeing it.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It's ok , it's like many of the other bubble games. I am still playing it now and then. Like I said before , it's ok
B00AREIAI8|5.0|best game I've ever played.I recemand it for every body!! I love that it looks so real it's awesome!! I named my horse applesauce shes so so so so so so so so cute
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I love this book.  The story's structure defined the characters and made them a part of my imagination.  I saw their physical attributes as well as felt their emotions.<br /><br />I could not put this book down and was sorry I had read it so quickly.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|I really like this watch. It has a great classic look with a nice weight. The price was perfect. Best birthday present to myself.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Season 3 didn't disappoint.  Don't forget your Kleenex here as there was an episode where I had to use it :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much. I love all the different levels and the characters. I love the way there be trains coming every direction. It's a fun game to play I love it.
B004ADH1RI|5.0|I enjoyed this as a kid--I am the same age as the boys.  I still enjoy it now. Great Movie!
B009MYARIK|4.0|I just love Sophie kinsella. Another great novel. Romantic and funny. I was hooked the whole way through the book.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|The dog is very cute but that wears off real quick. Mmay be young children would like it more if there was difrent things to do.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game it's SUPER fun. The only problem I have is with the Vector Battle. During the tutorial, I'm unable to jump. Besides that little problem, it's a great game.
055358894X|5.0|Getting this good of a book, for this low of a price, in this good of a state... What a find!
B009EEQL6A|4.0|While not an in-depth story, Unstoppable is definitely a movie that captures your attention and holds it throughout. There is tension and tenderness and two likable heroes. A good afternoon entertainer!
B007EZJKS2|1.0|This beautiful book is not appropriate for Kindle viewing and should be so stated in offer.  The words are too small and although they can be zoomed, it is not easy to do.  I would return the purchase if I could and order the hard copy instead.
1416960953|5.0|This is what my daughter was asking for. The local store was out so we sat in the parking lot and ordered on line. It has held her attention for weeks.<br />Highly recommended for grades 3-6.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Are you kidding????  This show is like a major addiction.  I can't help myself.  I watch episode after episode until there are none left.  I wish there wasn't so much nudity because it is unnecessary.  The story line is so well written that it can stand on it's own.  Edge of seat and every single episode leaves you hanging, making it impossible not to watch the next one....immediately!!!
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|After largely abandoning a lot of beliefs I've held for so many years and avoiding books concerning religion and faith for quite some time I was ready to start over with the basics, with history. What we have here is traditional Muslim scholarship regarding Christ. There is nothing wrong with that per se, its just that there isn't anything new here. It felt like I was reading Warraq's \\"Why I Am Not A Muslim\\" again with a simple switch of the religions. Unless you simply appreciate having it all laid out for you in a book, you can save a few bucks and start researching Islam's views of Christ.<br /><br />Iv'e given up establishing my own positions by reading books like this, Im looking more or less at how people of these faiths act. Would I be free to write this sort of book about Muhammed if I lived in a Muslim country? Would I be free to write this sort of book in a country largely populated by Christians? How you answer those questions will say something in whether or not you believe the author's personal faith played a role in the conclusions he came to.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It was easy to read, understand and follow. Some people are trying to sell programs that this shows you for free.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|Not as good the the Lord of the Rings, But still a GREAT Movie. I'm glad that they made the story into a trilogy.
B00D5O7BPU|4.0|Great simulation of real guns. It is recommended for fans of World war 2. The four stars is because there aren't many guns. I like it a lot.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|The determination,strength, and courage of the young is unbelievable. It was a lesson for all, in spite of the dysfunction of these parents.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just finished season 2 and can't wait to start season 3.  Very interesting time period.  So many different story lines.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I'm on book 4 of the series.  Interesting story line.  However, the series is written about, by, and for teens.  The author forgetting that he locked the door that his character just opened.  A character sleeping in bed and then rushing to the bed in the next paragraph.  Love BEFORE first sight (almost).  Even the 50-foot cyclops or the dragon whose footprints are like canyons aren't a match for the 14 year old boy.  I read before I turn out the light at night.  Most of the time I don't remember putting the iPAD down while reading about the Ring.  There are lots of other books I just can't put down.  But I still pick this one up!  :(
B0002YLC24|5.0|How can such a story be anywhere but in Paris? Great story and meeting (not by chance)! Glad we own it.
B007J7LFTW|5.0|Fantastic music as part one, but continued. To see the live show is a must, if you can still get tickets. Ian Anderson's talents are never-ending.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|I use this app on my Kindle Fire Hd 7, on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1 and on my HTC EVO LTE. All devices have better performance and the the special charging technology is very key.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is the first book in a long time that I have planned my day around, ensuring I kept up with the story as it evolved.  I recommend it
B00002E224|5.0|great romantic story of two young adults meeting and a long evening together - The casting and pace are super.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I absolutely love ColorNote. I had been looking for ages for a great calendar and note taker and this is it! The layout is awesome and easy to use. The reminders can be color coded and you can change or rename them whenever you want to.<br /><br />The POINT IS!!!! I love this darned thing! Get it, you won't regret it!
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|A very funny animated movie. This is the best animated movie that I have ever seen so far in my life.
B007712XAU|5.0|All of these items met or exceded our expectations. The books were special to me and will always be so.
B003QSS2VW|5.0|Got this for my son to watch. I had the book, and saw the movie when I was a child long ago.  If you know the Disney story / movie then this is the one for you.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I love the John Corey series of books.  I wish there were 20 more.  I couldn't stop reading this book.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|An awesome  spy movie of James Bond. This is one of the best James Bond movies I have ever seen.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|there was a lot of potential here, but the characters were not developed and the plot drug on... the last hour I thought it would turn around but it did not delivery. creative - yes. good - no.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a great and clean movie.  Clean movies and without bad language is hard to find these days.  We need more family movies like this one.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|I am glad to see that they finally have done a deluxe version of Brother & Sisters. This was my first ABB album way back in 1973 and I was blown away and have been a fan since. Listening to  Ramblin' Man while heading down I64 back to school in Richmond made me want to hear more so I bought the album (plus all the previous). Jessica was my favorite cut and is the best ever driving song recorded (watch your speed). The copy I bought had the misprinted song list and I always wondered about the song &#34;Early Morning Blues&#34; so I am glad it was included even though it is the same music essentially as &#34;Jelly Jelly&#34; (you can never have enough ABB). The concert included is great and brings back memories of seeing them at the Richmond Colosseum during the tour after the album was released.  Highly recommended for all ABB fans.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|Very funny and exciting movie about a son and mom. I would highly recommend this movie who loves funny movies.
B005LAII8A|4.0|When one sees Bruce Willis in one of the main roles, typically we expect to see an action movie.  Yes, there is plenty of action here; guns and fighting in this one.  But it is a film that mixes idea of time travel, extra sensory abilities of some of its characters and hard choices some characters have to make: husband willing to kill in order to alter events and save life of wife he adors, mother willing to sacrifice her own life to save the life of her son and a young man who will give up his own life to stop circle of violence.<br /><br />It is good movie for entertainment value.  Moral dilemma that people have and decisions they have to make in a blink of an eye.  There are no easy choices but the higher good seems to prevail.  For that message alone it is a kind of movie worth watching.
B005544V6A|5.0|Characters are witty, stories are interesting, and Harvy is awesome. Occasional swears if that bothers you. Definitely recommend. A series you can get hooked on.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|So far a good app. I don't shop a lot  but l like to compare pricing. Ebay like Amazon has a large selection
B0090EJR1K|5.0|A very good movie that is very hilariously funny. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch something that is a little different.
B0007DFJ0G|1.0|This is the most ridiculous, gimmicky movie I've ever seen. Full of plot mangling and obscenely predictable \\"twists\\", only a postmodernist Ivy League professor could enjoy this. For all those with half a brain, this movie sucks. There is no plot, no ultimate end or goal. It meanders on and on for hours, drowning the audience with nuances and absurdities. The thought process must have been, \\"We're not talented enough to make a great movie. Let's just make a movie drowning in gimmicks and come off as 'edgy'. Who needs rationale or artistic technique?\\" \\"Fight Club\\" is that piece of modern art in a museum that everyone hates transformed into the form of a movie script.
B00CF34B2I|3.0|glad it's finally on android, and a good start but not optimal for kindle fire. where's the online multiplayer? bluetooth is a good option but disappointing as a requirement. I'll be here when you get that sorted.
B008X8P8A8|2.0|I was anticipating that this would be similiar in some way to the PC game - either the strategic system or the tactical battles. It was neither
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|A funny movie about a man living with his teddy bear. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who love comedy movies.
B001NHNG64|5.0|Now I know why everyone likes Jack Reacher...well thought out....carries excitement....fiction that very well could be a real live event...author brings the reader into the characters world with ease of motion....although you could say it is somewhat predictable there are enough twists that change the landscape quickly...Enjoy the read
B000JMKTLO|3.0|The author keeps you reading, but her story seems contrived and as if she is trying to shock the reader.  She seems to have done enough to research to show she is smart and a thoughtful writer, but there is something lacking in her storytelling that makes the reader really connect with the story.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|Rollicking great fun. Action and humor from start to finish. Instant video worked great. See, it's fun. Bruce still got it.
B005SAV9SO|5.0|A very good and funny movie about teacher. The story line and actors is very good. I highly recommend this movie.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|There are very few books I want to read twice, but this is one of them.  In fact, the book is actually better the second time around.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! I could not put it down, and look forward to reading it each time I picked it up. The characters were real and believable.The story was sad, yet uplifting and inspiring.I learned so much about the meaning of flowers. I hadn't any idea of this prior to reading The Language of Flowers. I plan t refer to Victoria's dictionary in the future so as to keep the secret messages alive.Thank you, Vanessa, for touching my heart.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Too difficult for me to navigate. I couldn't really follow the purpose of the game. Not fast enough to get points.
B000SEJHRA|3.0|I had read 'Naked' before this book. I found 'Naked' to be laugh-out-loud funnier. This book was enjoyable but I was expecting it to be funnier.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is very exciting and entertaining. it reminds me of zoo tycoon and I will be playing this game for awhile
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I love this electronic version of sudoku.  It's better than making little marks and erasing them on paper.  I've only done sudoku puzzles occasionally in the past but with this app, I can see myself doing a lot more now and having fun with it.
B005QBBCMI|5.0|I have never seen a movie start out emotional and yet end up even more emotional in the end. This by far is Nicolas Cage's best film ever! It is a film that to this day I keep telling everyone that they need to watch. It is so raw and the emotions are so real it reaches the depth of your soul. Once you see it you will understand and appreciate this masterpiece of a classic! It is NOT a very easy movie to watch, but it is worth at least seeing this movie once.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|great game great price, the grand daughter loves it, she is on her kindle all the time addicted you might say
B00DHNJGCU|3.0|Twists & Turns to keep you guessing.  Sort of anyways.  I liked the cast.  But the writing was trying really hard to keep the audience guessing this way & then that way . . . . .  There were times when the editing was used to create a ruse.  The trailers were misleading.  Over all, I probably will not recommend this film, cast or not.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I always wanted a horse. I think this game is fun. The only problem is that I can't afford to pay for extra gems. The amount of gems required to buy items is a little excessive. Oh well... back to the grind.
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|I saw that it only had Open Network Sockets permission, I've seen this before and with only 1 permission I thought 'great'.  I usually keep my internet off unless I am using it so that I control - as much as possible - what information is sent across the internet to whomever my apps might.  But to require internet access in order to even play!?! That is just ridiculous.  I selected the app to open, and I see it barely open just to immediately hit me with a message that it requires an active internet connection in order to run and then it shuts down.  Say What?!?  I immediately distrusted this app and could not even give it a try.  Anything that does not allow me to control what access to my phone it has is not worth it.  So just beware, it requires an internet connection and will not run without it, and as such I don't trust it and I would caution you all to as well.  I just question what the developer is doing behind my back with my phone information when it is connected.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|great game great price, the grand daughter loves it, she is on her kindle all the time addicted you might say
B009K0OTVM|5.0|Simply amazing entertainment.  First season is available on netflix, purchased second season here and worth every penny.  You will love to hate Victoria!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|a n interesting and revealing story delving into the fascinating world of BDSM and deep loving relationships . Very easy to read. I couldnt put it down. I couldnt wait to turn the next page to reveal what would happen next. This  book is a real page turner! It has a subtle humour  adds charm to the characters
B005IQ39AY|1.0|I like the game in theory, it's simple but fun to play for a little while. However, on both versions (arcade and normal) it crashes and says the level failed, usually at the end of a supposedly successful level. Very frustrating!

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It's pretty good. I like the lab better than the streets.<br />There should be better prices on the minions. There should be more minions.<br />But it is good.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this. app is cool but the horses need to cost less because there are some cool horses but I cant buy them
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I've spent WAY too many hours playing! Terrific graphics and the commentators are hilarious!  Highly addictive. Get it you'll love it. Great job by the developers. Keep up the great work!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game great price, the grand daughter loves it, she is on her kindle all the time addicted you might say
1781162646|5.0|I read the book in one sitting. It is great to see that the old &#34;king&#34; style is back.<br /><br />I have followed him since the early days of which he lost me when the Dark Tower became the focus. I am back and a staunch supporter with the Dome, JFK and now Joyland.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|One of the first visual novels I've ever played. With six different endings, you'll be replaying this game at least five times to get every juicy detail out of this game! Planning on ordering the sequel soon!
B00DHNJCKQ|5.0|I thought this movie was great.  I enjoyed the plot, the acting, and all the action.  I was well satisfied with the end and felt that there weren't a lot of loose ends.  I enjoy revenge movies like man on fire, taken, etc but this one mixed a faint love story in.  Don't miss it.
1451695195|5.0|I loved this book. Mostly because the guy was a twice a year church goer before having this experience plus a doctor to boot. The guy knew what he was talking about. He was able to offer a rebuttal to every debunker out there. How great is that? It was well written and had nice cliff hangers at the end of each chapter (making it a page turner). I only wish heaven could be conveyed as more than just a blissful place where you fly on the wing of a butterfly...I find the best part of life is the variety. Even endless days of bliss could turn into hell after a month or so, but - hey- that's just me. Overall, a great read for those who are seeking.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|grrreat game, and I really enjoy the fact that it connects to my facebook like that, now I do not have to start from the beginning :)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I can look up the words I want it is awesome and I have a lot more dictionaries so I could look up the words
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|Superb!!! Was looking for the Kevin Spacey one but that is still way too unfinished so thought I'd get this one in the meantime. We all absolutely loved it! Super acting and such a great storyline! A must see! Highly recommended.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I have used Adobe for years and having it available for use on my kindle is great. Once again, Adobe rocks.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read in a long time. The point of view from which it is written is the male character. Many times he is speaking to us, the reader. You've got to read it to understand. Where do we find guys like this?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I hope 8.1 comes out soon because every ask for it and I really want red stone dust levers and other thing a lot of people want it so please make it soon
B008JFUTT0|4.0|Quite good. Expected more. Left me unmoved but my daughter enjoyed it. Personal preference. Read the synopsis and decide for yourself whether it sounds like something you would enjoy.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|What a disappointment.  Over 300 pages and it's still the same old thing - blah, blah, blah.  Maybe for some, but not for me!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game is fun but a little annoying don't have much Coins gotta buy them. Otherwise it is fun and funny
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This free app is flexible, powerful, does everything it claims to do and more.  I can't believe it's free!  The few bugs get fixed rapidly.  Bravo!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|It's an awesome game yet very addicting. I get so mad when you run out of coins. You have to wait like 5 MINUTES FOR LIKE TEN COINS and it freezes sometimes but, other than that I love this game
B00005JOHC|5.0|This show was my favorite.  Every episode is a riot.  I stopped watching when Charlie left - it will never be the same.
B008XKSW7M|2.0|I wanted to watch it be cause of the star cast.  But I didn't like the story line it was kind of slow.
140006922X|1.0|Anyone can make an argument. There are good arguments and bad arguments. This book uses bad arguments that are literally duplicates from an 18th century man called Reimarus, and current century men called S. G. F. Brandon and Philip Pullman.    Anyone can publish a book and advertise it. There are people who sell their books because of the quality of their work and then there is Reza Aslan who only sells copies because of a controversial interview on Fox and the persistent need for an echo chamber amongst atheists and muslims who deny the biblical Jesus.    Extrapolations and generalizations are legion in this novel fueled by the bias of Reza Aslan, a wannabe scholar who misrepresents his credentials. In actuality, Reza Aslan is not a “professor of religion,” and what he claims he does “for a living” is an outrageous inaccuracy. Reza Aslan is an associate professor in the Creative Writing program at the University of California, Riverside. He teaches there based on his Master of Fine Arts degree in fiction from Iowa, his relevant academic credential.    In addition, Reza Aslan received his PhD in sociology – not “History of Religions” – from the University of California, Santa Barbara in 2009. More here: [...]     Like anyone who uses the historical-critical method, Aslan excels in using it as a catalyst for his own opinions, scholarship be damned. His arguments rely too heavily on outside sources for interpreting source material. What this leads to is a framing issue where one can create multiple interpretations based on what sources that you use. Many of these sources are theories themselves that assume a certain way a group of people lived which makes it even more convoluted. He is also quick to change the meaning of the apostle's words to fit within his own personal interpretation and leaves out verses entirely that disagree with him.    If you've been waiting for 2 Peter 2:1-3 to be fulfilled, it just has.
B003M70O5O|4.0|Sons season two is great. The cast of characters all work well together. Every time I finish one episode I would have to start the next one.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|A modern and likable take on the familiar teenage theme of wanting to fit in, and/or for anyone who was ever a victim of their own good intentions in high school.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i really enjoy playing this hame evry now and then working up to earn more coins and unlocking new stuff
B00457X8BC|5.0|I love the Kurt Wallendar Mysteries. Henning Mankell does a great job building the suspense and drawing the reader into Wallendar's strange life. The characters are real. We probably all know people who are similar to the characters (except maybe the killers). I can't wait to read more!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I check this game every day cause it's full of surprises I love it for all ages must download take my word you will love it
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Clever, well-cast, and evenly-paced comic noir about the older generation showing their juniors the value of wisdom and experience.  John Malkovich gives a great comedic reprisal of his &#34;In The Line of Fire&#34; assassin.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I really loved this book - I always learn more about Afghanistan and its' people through Khaled Hosseini.  I love the way he develops his story and his characters - I actually read it twice so I would understand the relationships better.
B000M341RI|5.0|Some sad Hollywood director will probably try a remake that will be embarrassing to the whole US like they always do because they have no originality.<br /><br />Buy a British original and enjoy!
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a timeless classic that reminds us all to keep the spirit of Christmas all year round and that change IS possible.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|this was a pretty fun game. it made you think about things. there should definitely be more levels than there is.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Great for the weight,  cost, and flexibility.  I wish it had a little more cushioning as I can be hard on electronics
B00CCZ4BFQ|4.0|Really great music...it's not Night Songs, so don't expect songs like Shake Me or Somebody Save Me...it's more like the mellow songs found on Heartbreak Station.
B0097C8XL0|2.0|I thought that this game might be a good one for my grand kids but it was only so so
B00005N6KG|5.0|These are the best headphones I've used out of many I tried and in many years of running. Unfortunately, Sony stopped making them, and what were originally 10.00-12.00 headphones have now jumped up into the 30.00 range..for the same headphones. Thanks, but I'll find a substitute.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|The original episode was / is a bit hard to get into. After 3-4 episodes, I have enjoyed it.<br />In that, the new version, updated is of the caliber of D.A.<br />The time period and all that goes with it - is right up my alley.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I love the energy of this film, and the intertwining stories.<br />Bill Nighy steal absolutely every scene he is in. No matter how many times I watch it, Bill Nighy's scenes leave me wanting more arched eyebrows, more clenched jaws, and more sarcastic one-liners.<br />Everyone was just &#34;spot on&#34; in their roles.<br />I will never forget the last lines of the film, Stephen Collins telling Cal, &#34;You're no good for Anne anymore. Your name will be on the story. When you have your own you'll know; the kids, they shoot the messenger, they just do.&#34;<br />One of the best made films I've ever seen.  Makes the Hollywood version look pathetically weak.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I started playing this out of curiousity, and now I cant stop. one more run turns into ten. I like games where you do more reacting than thinking, and this game is great for that. ive lost sleep because I cant put it down, always trying to get a better best. The graphics could always be better, and I sometimes perform an action that the game doesn't follow through with- jumping instead of turning, for example- but it happens rarely enough that its not a bother.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|The item arrived on time. The season cases are cool and the whole set is great. Having HD on one side and regular DVD on the other is nice too. Overall very pleased.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This book kept me hooked! As soon as I started reading I couldn't put it down! Its intense and always keeps you wondering what will happen next! Loved it!!!
140006922X|5.0|In order to make an informed purchase decision I was looking for additional information to be provided about this author and book and found this in comments:<br /><br />\\"...he's a devout Muslim. He's a PH.D on the topic. He has been studying religionS... for twenty years...\\"
B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is VERY useful! I love it! My family and friend's use it! It gives me wonderful ideas, and helps me share mine! And to top it off, it's free. It is definitely worth it!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Didn't think I would like the show. Just started watching to pass time. Ended up watching seasons 1-3 in 3 weeks. Great show. Looking forward to seeing season 4 on Amazon, hopefully sooner rather than later.
B000FC1MCS|5.0|i read this book in a week and it is very good and interesting! I have to read it for school I was sad but once i started reading it i didn't even notice how far i'd gotten in the book. It is a good book for teenagers. I was not expecting all of the foul language.
159463176X|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's novels have touched an emotional part in me like no other author ever has.  I was very excited when I heard his new book was being released but was a little worried after reading other highly-anticipated books this summer like Dan Brown's \\"Inferno\\" and came away rather disappointed.  Thankfully this novel was all I hoped for and more: another brilliant gem from Hosseini!<br /><br />Hosseini has the magnanimous power of crossing space and time with ease and excavating the human soul with such raw gentleness.  This book continues that wonderful power and excels it to new, exciting levels.  For example, the scene with taking the 120-second photo with a pinhole camera is the best writing of the last 50 years!  It is totally beautiful and tragic all in the same breath!<br /><br />There are so many wonderful wormholes into the point-of-views of such interesting characters and each one drips with the reality of human brutality and beauty.  You can't help but silently find yourself in many of them and begin to not only question the characters but our own motivations (this happened to me with the section about the girl in the hospital).  Hosseini is truly the greatest storyteller of our time!
B0063M22QO|5.0|loved this game eould sit and play it all day and night has enough different tiles to keep your inerestt
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang, great job BEST game in a gamers life I have it on PC and it equals out with PE great job Notch,Jeb and Dinnerbone great job!!!
B007B5EDEG|5.0|usually when I watch the movie/tv series first, then I don't like the book, so I was hesitant to buy the books, but im sooo glad I did, its so indepth and I was able to piece together bits of the tv show that didn't quite make sense, its a complicated story line, but very easy to follow. its a brilliant book series, and I cant put my kindle down.
0060873175|4.0|If you adjust your expectations this is a fun summer read. This isn't one of Crichton's better books but it is still a good thriller.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|My daughter wanted to watch this ... and I didn't. After searching for 15 more (fruitless) minutes, I caved in, and was I ever glad I did.<br /><br />What an incredible movie .... yeah some of the animation is still obvious, however if you can suspend your disbelief for a couple hours, you can really enjoy this video.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THOS GAME IS AWSOME<br />The minions are so funny they run around kn the back and have the time of their lives!
B005K17RU0|4.0|one of the best free weather apps I've used. It's easy to use, clear and accurate. And I like the extras like good/and weather for fitness.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|only issue I have is Derpy's name is Derpy. Not &quot;that pony&quot; or &quot;my friend&quot;. if you like the show you already have this so there's not much else to say.
B00005JN4H|5.0|This is just a fun film period. I love it to death. I saw this on tv once, and it became an instant favorite. I would watch it every time it came on. Love Queen Latifah and especially Jimmy Fallon.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|It's what I was looking for simple and clean. No complaints, my old clock app I have been using for years would only work landscape not portrait. Which I need now because I charge phone in a docking station.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|As you wander through this book,you will find bits of yourself, questions you've asked and dreams you've had.  Read it slowly, reflect and enjoy it!
B0002IQMKM|5.0|This must be the cd! All talking heads lovers should really dig this one. There were good tracks on here I had never heard as well.
1594746036|5.0|I bought this book as it was referred to me by a friend. Although I'm not personally into the underlying groundwork of the novel (alternate dimensions of reality, time and space) the story was captivating and curious, the children as characters were definitely peculiar enough to hold my interest. The book trips along quite nicely, has lots of goodies and surprises, and the injection of the old photo's is quite an alluring addition. It's the kind of story I'll probably read again sometime.
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|This book intriged me right up until the last two chapters when it seemed to lose some credibility by making complications for the sake of complications.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So many surprises in this season. Some on going issues seem to be settled only for a new issue to turn them upside down.
B000002IWH|5.0|I love this soundtrack. It has so many great tracks from artists I would have never discovered otherwise. I would recommend it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I try to use my channel and it stops saying vTube is not working would you like to close it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best and most addicting game ever. I play this all the time and I love it. You have to buy this game!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Society run amok and at the same time hope for a better world.  In spite of the evil inherent in us, there is also good ready to rise to the occasion.  Although targeted toward younger audiences, it conveys a message worthy of all willing to learn.
B000026I8U|5.0|I don't know how anyone cannot love Manu Chao. Seriously good artist. This album is worth every penny, especially because you cannot find a lot of these songs on itunes.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I got it for my grandson (12). A little dated but still has a message about perseverance and work. He also enjoyed the movie.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|An excellent read, captivating characters who u really feel for. Spans  generations & continents in a beautiful manner that will keep u hooked. Sad when finished!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Have all of his books on my kindle,recommending it to family. He keeps me wanting to tkrn the page without going into boring details. Excellent author
B009PMEEY2|5.0|Excellent game! Has me hooked. I highly recommend this for any &#34;Match 3&#34; lovers. It will keep you occupied for hours on end.
030789701X|5.0|This strategy guide may remind some of a school textbook.  And it should because it tells you pretty much everything about the game (including the DLC; something most guides aren't updated for).  I keep expecting the teacher to come up and say &#34;Pop quiz!&#34;
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is great for little kids because they can play it and learn responsibly about of taking care of the horses
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is good it's kinda like pets horses but free! Anyways I think their should be an easier way to get free gems.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This is one of the toughest Match 3 games I have encountered. Yes, I love it and no, I'm not getting much work done. I highly recommend it to anyone addicted to Match 3 games.
B007THA4FI|1.0|What a miserable group of people in this story. Not my kind of book at all. The only redeeming character was the one who died. I was so disappointed.
0671646788|5.0|probably the best book I read so far. I would recommend it to anybody. Strong arguments. This book changes your vision of thinking.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|a good day to die hard with his now adult son in russia great acting on bruce willis, special effects and actions .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so fun you can spend hours playing it its fun fun fun and good for the car
B00632HWOG|3.0|The user interface is simple and easy to use. Since it comes directly from Yahoo, the account is always synchronized when accessed from a different device, e.g. home PC or laptop with Outlook.<br /><br />On the Kindle Fire, it did lockup once and the device had to be restarted to be able to retrieve new email. This has not happened on other devices such as the Samsung Galaxy.<br /><br />One annoying thing are the updates, which change the user interface (not always for the better) and require getting used to something new.<br /><br />I haven't figured out how to get rid of the &#34;beeping&#34; notifications, other than &#34;burying&#34; the device under a pillow at night.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Sub way suffers is awesome I recommend it it has ok graphics but is still awsome. Last it is way better than temple run
B005LAIH2C|3.0|hansel having diabetes it seems funny and coul be realistic if he ate a lot of sugar as a child and developed it .

B003VXMMTK|5.0|I loved the acting in the movie.  The story is tragic but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend to anyone who enjoys period pieces.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why oh why great apps think they need to change is beyond me. As others have ...said, it's a mess. Did you get really bad reviews, is that why? Do a study first...please go before the more professional look and feel
B001I189MQ|5.0|Just the best Batman movie ever! The Joker steals this movie, he was awesome, the best villain ever portraid in a movie.
B005PK553C|5.0|Kept me wondering and engaged the whole time!!!! A must see series! I hope they get season 2 on prime instant video!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I first posted this 18 months ago from Amazon the day it first came out.  Didn't use it much at first.  Now may use it almost daily.    I just raised my rating from 3 to 5 stars.  Actually, it is now a 5 star device - IF you have one of about 20 diff. Android phones bcause it will quickly cast ANYthing that shows on the phone screen.  IF you can get a picture or video or app to display and run on the phone screen, it will cast to the TV.  If you are stuck in the Apple herd, at least for now, no Apple devices have this great new feature.     We can now run XfinityGo, ESPN, HBO, SHO etc. apps along with the usual Neflix, youtube etc. In our 2nd home.  This means we can cut way back on our cable bill there.  Can even cast CNN and MSNBC and other news via the Xfinity app.             18 month old review is below:    Just got it today from Amazon.  Set up on Android phone and tablet was easy.  Wouldn't go on ipad 1.  (at least for us)  Did go on Win7 laptop.    Major disappointment was Netflix.  Send instruction from phone to start playing BBC Sherlock Holmes from Netflix.  Pic quality was barely SD.  Then replayed those first five minutes and rest of program on Netflix from the built in Netflix app on our Panny plasma.  HD quality.  We also get HD like streaming from Netflix from our Sony BD player's Netflix app.  Since this is a work in progress - will just give it an \\"average\\" rating for now and come back in a month or two.  This product could be a major \\"life\\" changer.    I am surprised that there is no Amazon app since they were one of only two outlets (BBuy being the other) to carry the product.    Am glad I got it.
B000HZD08M|5.0|A simple story but great to watch because there is so much beauty in the movie, the art, the movements of the actors; just the focus on small details.
140006922X|1.0|Doesnt even deserve one star, just wanted to let readers out there know that the guy who wrote this is a religious Muslim purposely trying to discredit Jesus, dont believe me? Do some research. Its garbage.
B003IDMUT0|4.0|this book keeps you in suspense and gives you a bit of insight into the corrupt world of the legal profession.I t may give some thoughts to a few addicts also.A thouroughly enjoyable read
B00296A4F4|5.0|Good writing and acting, and I'm in it for the music! Interesting to see the growth of the cast in their roles.
B00AEUPOVQ|5.0|If you are a lover of Jane Austen, you must see this. There have been several versions, and a more recent one for Masterpiece Classic had some great moments as well, but this really is the topper. Amanda Root is completely perfect as the small, quiet, dutiful daughter still suffering from her broken engagement years past. Her foppish father, by the late, great Michael Redgrave is equally spot on, with his arrogant proclamations. Her friend, Lady Russell, played by the late Susan Fleetwood, is wonderful, as she continues to &#34;guide&#34; Ann. I think one of the movie's strongest features is how realistic it seems. The clothes, the sets, the ease in which the actors interact, makes it appear as if it was all real, and not the result of a great novel. The actors aren't made up to be exquisitely beautiful--instead they all look quite natural, makeup and surgery free. It's another detail that makes this movie truly realistic and wonderful. You can feel the pain that Ann carries, and how her family ignores her. And you will adore Captain Wentworth, played with such intensity by Ciarin Hinds, another fantastic British actor. This is one of my favorite movies of all time.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't know you John Green and I don't even care who you are.  With this said...thank you for making me feel, for making me cry! This is why I rate TFIOS as many stars as there is in this universe. BRAVO! BRAVO!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for little kids and supper easy to understand. My little girl loves to play and take care of herb horse.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I expected to see a movie that was once again mostly hype, even though Joss Whedon wrote and directed it. I was wrong! It was super. I especially loved Mark Ruffalo as the Hulk--very interesting portrayal, and his interactions with the other actors was terrific. And Scarlett Johannsen (sp?) was also terrific, and I often find her to be over-hyped...this is her best next to &#34;Girl With the Pearl Earring.&#34; This is definitely worth seeing, and I anticipate the sequel!
B000VE439Y|5.0|This remains my favorite Monty Python movie. I've probably seen it about 50 times. The first 10 viewings were needed to catch the parts I missed because I was laughing so hard. I bought it to share with those who haven't seen it
B001GF7WRW|5.0|They sound good and balanced, will definitely require bumping up the audio quality if you're listening to something like free internet radio. Not for extremely spoiled ears, but I would first invest in (really) high quality audio/amps before getting something more expensive/better. Right now, listening to 320kpbs straight from the computer's audio port, I'm more than happy with them.<br /><br />After having them for about a month, they've broken in nicely. Everything seems sturdy yet it is lightweight. Good cable, headband, pads, etc. Very comfy even while wearing glasses.
B002LANLDK|3.0|It is what it is.  It's a movie about tough guys driving fast cars and hanging out with very attractive women.  Acting was good enough.  Definitely better than many of the sequels.
B006S086AM|4.0|its funny & enjoyable.<br /> Bill murrry dies it in in a funny kinda way.<br /> some great on going gages...<br />ya
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome App! Good to have . Maybe they could lower prices and stop adding a bunch of new stuff .
B0012QVJXS|4.0|I love this movie.  It's a superhero movie I can actually watch with my kids.  No crazy and inexplicable levels of violence.  Good characters.  Funny in places.  Great family movie.
B004IFGORQ|4.0|Great move .. my son loves it.<br /> very funny for adults & kids.<br />it play up the magic of being a kid!<br /> We will watch it again and again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun and very addictive.... My 3yr old and I can't get enough of this game and it's free.....Awesome game!!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I know the demo doesnt have a lot of time,  but just buy the full game! It's worth the money:)
B007SGM084|5.0|Oh, what a page turner. You knew that horrible man Jack was not out of the story so you read on & on. No disappointment!
B008Y78M60|4.0|I am an history buff. The civil war was one of my favorite times in history because so much relied on the outcome.
0307970868|5.0|Great story.  Love the supernatural aspect and the love story!  It is easy to get into and it has you gripped all the way through.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Raw, Real, Riveting!!!!  I watched the series on Netflix first and loved it so much that I had to explore the source.  This is an honest portrayal of something that could happen to any us if we want to be honest.  I could not put it down.  A girl goes from having it all to being scared to close her eyes in the matter of days for a mistake she made years ago.  This memoir also helps us get beyond the stereotypes we have of prisoners by telling some of their back stories which are actually heart wrenching.  Funny, frightening and fantastic!!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|beautiful and deep story, loved every word of it. thanks Colleen for writing such a great book and for the free read. i will definatly check out your other books.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the app before it was changed. Now it is time to delete this app and find a useful one.
3836538725|5.0|I loved Salgado's work on social issues, a strong vivid eye on humanity... and with this work on nature and mother Earth, he confirmed him as a photography master of all times!
B008Y768XO|5.0|This movie is wonderful, as for me I own 2 Akitas. This breed is just amazing, couldn't imagine a day without them. This movie shows the loyalty of the breed. Although I must say, while the akita breed is beautiful, smart, loving, loyal etc they are NOT the breed for everyone. Do your research before deciding that the Akita breed is for you. With all breeds do your research! Absolutely a beautiful movie, I've had the pleasure of meeting the Akita that was used in the film. Wonderful experience.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Loved the story line.  Very creative, clever, and easy reading.  I enjoyed it very much.  It could have been phenominal and would have been a book to read with my children, but with the cursing and inuendos, I will have to pass. But overall a great read.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|its a fun game but its annoying that everything not only costs so much in bits but to ACTUALLY spend money on ponies is insane. why call it a free game if u have to spend so much on the main characters?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good. But I wish some stuff was cheaper. And again overall is a pretty awesome app
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I am sad that a story that has been with me for so long is over. I am extremely gratified at the quality of the ending.
B007BGQFTQ|5.0|I usually don't care if a book is particularly well written if it is a good story.  But the Parasol Protectorate series is a joy because it is well written AND a good story.  The description of Victorian England dress and manners is impeccable.  I smile a lot while reading and sometimes laugh out loud.  And the mystery in each book is interesting. The heroine, Alexia, is a hoot and manages everything with aplomb and grace (and humor).  I love the series; it is now one of my Favorite/Favorites.  I highly recommend it.  I've already bought the audio versions from audible.com because I find listening to books I have loved reading brings out what I missed when reading.  I'm looking forward to listening in the near future.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|Very entertaining, I'm glad I purchased it..it was fantastic!! It was a film that I shared with my family.  Our two teens enjoyed it too. It had great humor and lots of action. I highly recommend it!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like playing solitare as a way to zone out and relax.  This app is great for playing on my tablet.  If you play the game with the internet connection off, the adds between the games eventually go away.<br />All I can say is this works for me!
B000W8HC8I|4.0|This book was insightful, and made me realize that we should all attack wall street...or join in on the madness.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Very fun, addicting and time-consuming. A lot of missions, goals, etc... have been added to keep you busy with the dinosaurs and managing the park. I personally think this app is a lot better than Farmville and you don't have to spend any actual money to get ahead in the game.
B0001XAPZ6|1.0|I can't comment on the film as I am not able to watch it. Be aware that this dvd might not play in a standard player. I have never had issues with playing dvd's and was really looking forward to this and one other I purchased at the same time. Neither will play in my player.
B004G0SJU8|5.0|I love this movie, very imaginative! Great idea for a movie or even a book. I love this movie so much!
B008M721MS|5.0|I use Skype all the time at work. Many of our employees are all over the United States and we have a conference call every Monday morning via Skype. I used to call in to the conference call from either my desk phone, or use the Skype app on my Galaxy S3, but this app on the Kindle Fire HD works perfectly. It turns the entire Kindle into a big cell phone. It's also easy to hear other people on the call because the kindle has two speakers on either horizontal size of the device.
B00003CXBK|1.0|I can not comment on the film itself since I am unable to watch it. I think this may be a pirated version as it will not play in my standard player. I've never had trouble before. I recently purchased this and one other anime film and neither of them will play. Very frustrating.
B000JML90Y|5.0|It's a free e-book, and it's a classic, what else can I say about it? Reading on my Blackberry Z10. Mahalo Amazon.com.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was great!! Highly recommend it! I couldn't put it down once I started.  It is perfect for a beach read!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It's a free e-book, and it's a classic, what else can I say about it? Reading on my Blackberry Z10. Mahalo Amazon.com.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I was skeptical when I originally saw the previews for this show on F/X, but once I started watching it on Netflix, we had to buy it.  It is awesome!  You can't watch just one episode, it's so addicting.  We now have all 5 seasons on DVD.
B00DGQF0K0|5.0|This is the best game I have played yet!  Once I get started it is difficult to put it down.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I'm a big fan of John Grisham.  I couldn't believe that when this novel was first published, no one would read it!  (Read the prologue).  I read this in about 3 days.  Stayed up late, Read it on my Droid at work. Read at red lights.  Read in bed.  I couldn't put it down.  I expect Sycamore Row to be just as good if not better.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Awesome game to have, great timewaster and, you can get used to it pretty quick. great for people who like to evolve or like sharks.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|It's fun but if you successfully complete a puzzle, I wish it would automatically advance to the next layout. Maybe if they update it...hint to programmers.  It gets a little annoying having to bounce back and forth.
140006922X|1.0|If you read this book, you should keep in mind that the author Aslan is a devout Muslim, and the book is not an attempt to shed an unbiased perspective on Jesus.  Rather, the book rehashes Muslim viewpoints of Jesus throughout.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|its a good game to play. I like how there's the underwater park and the winter park. I would have never thought of that. over all I love this game.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|The Best Movie I've Ever Seen In My Life It had a lot of everything and it also shows how blacks were treated back then.
B002JCSWVG|5.0|good product, good price and on time.<br />we all love it, and will buy more in the near future, ---
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I was unable to put this book down.  It was addictive!  I couldn't wait to read what was coming next.
B001JNNE64|1.0|S-T-U-P-I-D Video. Dumb and rediculus no Greg page from the wiggles and no Johnny Depp from alot of movies stupid rediculus waste of time R rated movie ever.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I downloaded this game for my 9 year on her kindle fire and she loves it. The only problem with this game is that the next goals she has wants her to add friends. My 9 year doesn't have a Facebook acct. So she can't get passed these goals unless i pay for coins
B002BBJ52U|5.0|One of the best... Smart and entertaining movie, highly recommend.  Why do these reviews have to be so many words?????
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|We enjoyed these films very much.  The shipping was quick.  It was so nice to be able to watch the three movies back to back.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|If you like the humor in Family Guy, you will love this movie. A lot of inappropriate material, interested to see what happens with Ted2.
0763644765|2.0|This book was the most disappointing of the 4 potty books that I bought. It has very few words and doesn't explain the potty process at all. My 20 month old son does enjoy the pictures and book.
B003R4ZMJU|2.0|Got this after reading the books, the books are a lot better. Couldn't get into this series. Stick to the books.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I like the product. Sure wish it had an option to e-mail me with the todo, but maybe that will come.
B005GFPZYK|2.0|Typical American wave the flag rubbish, i just couldn't finish it. Gave up half way through. Why couldn't he just tell it like it is rather than continually point out he is the most lethal sniper, how he was just at the right place all the time.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|Dark Places was published in 2009, 4 years before Gillian Flynn's best seller &#34;Gone Girl&#34;. I expected the same cleverness in the plot, with many twists and turns that takes you on a journey and adds to the excitement of turning each page (well if it was a paperback, but on my Kindle, pressing the arrow).<br />One can see that Gillian is still mastering her craft in Dark Places and the web that is woven, could be considered rather far fetched at times. The dysfunctional family described in the book and the community they live in, seems awfully real, though, particularly the economics of being poor, although there are events in the story line that have been included to make the plot work.<br /><br />I still thought it was a good way to spend some leisure time and will look out for other books that Gillian Flynn pens.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you want the book of truth, this is the one. I love this because you can take it with you anywhere. If you ever feel sad, stressed, or even happy the Bible is the best place to go. I love it, love it, love  it!!! :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I'm a mother of 3 boys and we all love playing Minecraft! This game brings my boys more fun than any PC, PS3 or Wii game! Totally worth the money! The boys get so excited for new updates.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I absolutely could not put this down. A great book for SF newbies and old timers alike. Enough said get reading
B00CATSONE|5.0|This book was incredibly interesting . I had no idea he was so instrumental in discovering so many things for our way of life. His conflicts with Thomas Edison and competitions involving the wealthiest men in the country due to their inventions blew me away. More credit  should be given to this amazing inventor.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I could go on and on about how Neil Gaiman's novels have affected me, but I won't. I'll keep it short and sweet. If you are a fan of Mr. Gaiman, this book brings his similar style of blending the mystical with the ordinary, the surreal with the real. In other words, more of the great kind of &#34;stuff&#34; he usually gives us. If you are a newcomer to Neil, you are in for a treat. It's an &#34;easier&#34; read than some of his more epic novels but it can hit you in the nostalgia so hard that you would have to be made of ice to not feel something from this story. A must have.
B0016YBFZ8|4.0|This is a movie that I can watch over and over. Always engaging me throughout the flick. It's been a long time...
B005C8ENI0|5.0|awesome<br />movie i would watch it again and agin thanks for making it so easy to streem from my ipad
B003M6OW4Y|3.0|I thought they went off the rails towards the end.  The concept of the Dollhouse was interesting enough and the engagements each week had merit as stand alone stories.  But the overall plot for the series seemed pretty forced and towards the end it got pretty thin.  Like the writers were grasping to tie things together.  The two epitaph specials were great (of course they were since they had Felica Day and Eliza Dushku in them!).  But still the plot and the writing wasn't the greatest.  The actors did well with some pretty average material they were working with.
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|Innovative and very entertaining. Character Driven story is fabulous.<br />Frank Underwood (Spacey) has got to be one of the most memorable characters from recent times.
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Best series ever! Jack is so funny. Daniel Jackson and Teal'c really add to the episodes, and Carter is both beautiful and intelligent.<br />!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I love music with a good beat and no lyrics that I can listen to while I work. These songs I just stumbled apon recently from a pandora station. I found myself liking every one, so I just bought the album.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|We loved this movie it had the action for the teenagers and a decent enough story line for the adults.
B005DJREJS|4.0|This has been a fun show for me to watch at night after my kids go to sleep. The acting is great. The characters are interesting and not without depth. Because I am way past my teenage years I can watch this show purely for the entertainment value. I think as a teenager I might feel more empathy/stress towards the storylines.  I would definitely recommend this show.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I depend on AccuWeather because they are accurate. If I need to know something right away, I go to them.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Love the show and we cannot wait until the next season.  The casting for this show is perfect.  Gotta have.
B004RL9T50|4.0|Good movie, lots of humor and none of it inappropriate.  Very creative and fun plot.  It was better than expected.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Love the show and we cannot wait until the next season.  The casting for this show is perfect.  Gotta have.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|The stories in this book make all of the scientific jargon bearable.  If you are interested in changing habits in your life this is the book for you.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Ruined a perfect picture!<br />Tried to use this product to zoom in on specific part of picture and add a cute quote.  All worked fine until i tried to SAVE my changes!  I specified specific folder and name, closed the app, then went back to the original picture and when i select it to view... its all gray! I do search on my phone for the file i saved!!!! Can't find it!  The new picture is MIA and the original is screwed up!  Also, when you select update to Facebook, it acts like something is happening but sure the hell aint updating to YOUR facebook page!  ONE WORD = CRAP!
B005JR3Y5W|2.0|This New Girl was a nut.  Very unstable and would be tough to live with and keep one's own sanity.  I can't imagine the 3 guys taking her in.  Am not interested in the rest of the series.
B002X9GX4S|5.0|This album helped me through a very rough time in my life. Every time I listen to it it kinda makes me sad, those times imprinted with the album, but its an amazing listen.
B008Y768XO|5.0|The relationship between this dog and his master was a tremendous example of loyalty - both ways.  My wife and I have had 7 dogs over last 45 years and we loved each one of them and grieved as one died.  The one I have now is getting old and is both blind and deaf.  It will probably be my last.
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|I loved the game but just like a lot of other comments ... mine kept crashing and would not open. You lose all your progress .. start all over and then it crashes again. I had to delete it.  if they would fix it, lots of people would play it. ....kindle fire HD player
B0093ST02E|3.0|This was an unusual husband and wife relationship.  Makes you wonder what they saw in each other.  The second guy was just after a sex partner.
B00BQ1DAHC|5.0|I really like to listen to rock music with great melodies and I'm starting to get more into heavy metal.  This band blends together so many of the music styles that I like that there is never really a point where you get bored of the sound because every song is so different.<br /><br />This is their best effort to date and I can't recommend it enough. 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Each puzzle was interesting enough; some how I felt like I accomplished something, at the end of each puzzle.  Keep your eyes open and you shall prevail.
B00821OX98|3.0|Heard a lot about this series and so I figured trying Amazon Prime would generate more interest in it for me.  The chronic &#34;buffering&#34; as I attempted to watch the very first premier episode, just killed it for me.  I can't see paying for Amazon Prime, if you can't watch a TV program that stops for &#34;buffering&#34; every 45-60 seconds.  I'll pass on Amazon Prime once the free trial period is complete.  I'm NOT satisfied at all, with the streaming quality and the &#34;below average&#34; offering of Prime movie selections.  Amazon needs to re-tool and re-package this streaming video formula.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Orson Scott Card's ability to tell a great story lives on. His storytelling ability keeps you engaged and begging for more.<br /><br />In my opinion, Speaker for the Dead was much better than Enders Game. A must read for any science fiction lover.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Though its billed as a young adult/teen movie, as an Adult, I thought it was very good.  Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress, but Woody Harrelson's character is pretty keen and well played.
B003TTH4IU|5.0|Drama, drama, drama! This never ends! The drama and the plots are even better and even more realistic than General Hospital! I would recommend these episodes for anyone who is looking for a refreshing new soap opera!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This minecraft game is amazing it's like the best game I've ever played ever. The texture is really cool to.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This movie is so deep! It deals with mortality, immortality, spirituality, heaven and hell! This movie also deals with true love, lust , greed and truth and lies and deception<br />  This movie deals with good in its purest form and evil at its worst! In this move, mankind tries to communicate with their dearly departed. This movie reminds us that money and material wealth are only fleeting thing. Love matters most! Without love, all is meaningless!
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book will change your perception of meals and will ultimately turn you in to a much much healthier person.  It's a must read.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|As a general  guide this has some value.  I  was disappointed with the lack of detail.  It just provided an overview.
B0031RS7X6|5.0|This is my first Sophie Kinsella book and I loved it. It was laugh out loud funny,cleverly written and a great fun read. Thoroughly recommend!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|The movie was clean for the most part and funny. My wife thought it represented pregnancy fairly well. It's rare to find a clean comedy you can watch with children.
B00DU73T08|4.0|I love a good romance, so I did like the movie. I am glad that I didn't pay full movie theater prices!
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|I purchased this app because, well, basically, I had run out of outlets next to my bed.  Something had to go, so the ol' alarm clock went.  This app works great, with just one big draw-back for me.  With this latest update (July '13) a new problem was introduced – the screen brightness!  Not sure what changed, or why, but the screen is now (even at its lowest setting) too bright to be a decent night-stand clock.  Used to be fine with the Kindle's brightness turned all the way down, followed by the in-app brightness setting all the way down.  Now it's just too much to sleep next to.  Please fix and this app will be near to perfect again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its so great and its better than other gamed like temple run I love it so awesome to play .and on the behave of me and my family we love it
B000E1JOSE|5.0|very good always been a fan of Roy Orbison with all the great talent this had to be the very best
B0064MGU98|5.0|Julianna Margulies is a classy actress- she really makes this show. Love it!! I'm so glad I have three seasons to look forward to!
0316187216|4.0|It was good, there were a couple things about the ending that bothered me and the whole time I just wanted more bloody nine.
B00BPLDCVM|5.0|The songs are really fitting to the show and you can see the scenes play out in your head. Love it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I really like this book and I thank God that I`m ok today. I highly recommend this book to other 9 year old boys....
B00BJG7H3M|4.0|The second season of Suits gets a little complicated. It still has all the same personalities, but it seems to overdevelop some of the characters (such as Harvey and Jessica) and thrown some curve-balls that seem to come out of left field. The show seems to always have some little file, document, or scandal that magically appears at the most inopportune moments and too many scenes with that end with a dramatic one-liner. It's a little harder to follow and more frustrating than the first season, but all-in-all it still entertains.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I agree to what everyone else says. The graphics are awesome, it's fun and addicting, and the movie turned out  really good!!!!!
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I love seeing what the women are wearing.  I also enjoy see how historical events actually affected people of many different classes.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|My 6 yr old son loves this game and all the cut the rope games. He made me download all of them.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|First heard about this movie seeing Rec3 movie available on netflix, read alot of reviews and decided to check it out, happy I watched it.  Movie is in spanish, you can select english language but its quite obvious that the actors are still speaking spanish, with someone else speaking english and it was overlapped onto the movie.  I ended up just watching it in spanish, and reading the subtitles, as the english overlap was very flat often, didn't fit with the scene not enough emotion, sometimes no emotion at all.
0670024813|3.0|I found this book interesting, but much less awe-inspiring than the previous books by Jared Diamond. It is an excellent summary of Jared's observations in primitive societies, and why those people react differently than we do in more modern societies to certain events. However it lacks I found, the vision and the fantastic eye-opening thesis of his previous books.
1781162646|5.0|King doesn't disappoint. It's not the most complex story in the world, but it was an enjoyable read. Great reading for the beach.
B005K17RU0|4.0|started using after the weather channel one turned to useless after update. easy to use &amp; concise. a much better option
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book (on Kindle) : very believable story of the complexities of human nature and the interaction within a family with a teenage son, and the reactions of the community around them when the son is suspected of murder. Very readable and leaving open-ended questions at the end. Would highly recommend!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is one of those games that is so fun to play, it takes up lots of your time.<br />I do enjoy playing it and would recommend it.  It seems well balanced, allows you to buy speed-ups (jewels), but you can earn then without paying to get stuff.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Lot's of fun!!!  I can't wait to play each day.  I am really looking forward to playing each new level. Fun fun fun!
140006922X|1.0|The author doesn't know anything about Jesus.  He is a Muslim and not a historian. I highly recommend reading The Holy Bible to find out more about Jesus or the books One God One Message and All That The Prophets Have Spoken, again if you are truly seeking the truth about who Jesus is, why He came and what He did for you. Regardless of what one might believe or think about Jesus know this- every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord - including this Muslim author.<br /><br />Philippians 2:5-11 (NLT) You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.  Though he was God, he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to.  Instead, he gave up his divine privileges; he took the humble position of a slave and was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form, he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on a cross. Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honor and gave him the name above all other names, that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
0805053883|5.0|Great book with nice pictures, fabulous for babies hard cover. Great story for babies. I recommend this for babies. Excellent!
B0085BHHOS|4.0|It has Britney songs, that aren't really popular, so i only recommend it for really big Britney fans :) :)
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I'm so happy I made my purchase. The watch just arrived, beautiful color, solid watch, beautiful construction.  I just wore it on my wrist and the compliments already poured in.  I purchased 4 INVICTAS at the same time of this design.  My goal is to purchase one INVICTA watch every month.  I highly recommend this watch.  I LOVE IT.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is a very fun easy game to play. If you get stuck on how to draw any of your word choices you can &quot;cheat&quot; and just write out the word. A couple of times when I have been playing I chose one word to draw but my opponent was sent a different word. For example I chose to draw corner but they thought they were trying to guess gameboy and got it wrong.  That can be frustrating because it resets the game count.
B00BS4PF0C|5.0|Loved this album! Best yet Blake! Excited to see what is next from you. Thanks for being real and being you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much! I get to interact with my own horse and train for compititions! I would recommend this app for everyone who loves horses
B005LAIH4A|4.0|I have always enjoyed Dr Seuss books and to see them animated into movies is a joy.  I love the message of this book in particular and the trees are beautiful to look at too.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I just love the prospect of other worlds that have life.  Also love the Anderson's attitude through the entire show.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|I haven't played this game personally, but my boyfriend really enjoys it. He says it's fun and has a an easy to use interface.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game concept is new to me but very enjoyable. Challenging but not frustrating. Great game! Highly recommended! Please keep adding levels and thank you for making it free!!
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I expected was very nice product, I am satisfied with the product, as they offer, pay the right price, I will continue watching deals, highly recommended!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|Quirky, strange, fantastic characters, costumes and sets. Just good fun. Johnny Depp is amazing as Barnabas Collins. He brings it, as he does in all his movies. A few belly laughs, but mostly, just a constant smile on your face.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Great read....I have been never disappointed with this series.<br /><br />Would recommend the entire Psy/Changeling series as a great summer read.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I think this will make it so much more easily available, and trying to read on an Iphone is ubsurd.  I still don't do it, rarely, and normally wait til I a with my laptop.  I hope it is as great as it appears so far!
B00BRPH4EC|5.0|My kids and I love HIM. We have followed this band for years. No other band is like this, so accessible and timeless and spooky. It is the perfect music of Fall along with Type O Negative's October Rust. This album brings some of the sublime beauty of the earlier albums back while still feeling like a new album that stands on its own. It is an ideal record to turn to when you feel like having a good time brooding over some dark red wine.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I grew up with Star Trek since 1970, I thought this was a fantastic movie that kinda relived some of the original characters and a great cameo by Leonard Nemoy.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Yahoo mail loads much faster on my Kindle Fire than on my laptop. Great app! I highly recommend it to anyone using Yahoo mail.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Thought this sounded like a great idea, but how does this directly compete with the Apple TV or Roku? You must use your own device to stream everything on your TV. Both Apple TV and Roku have everything built in and require zero alternative devices to work. I can see the fun factor selling many of these initially but don't believe this will catch on to significantly effect the streaming market shares.
B006M4F67A|5.0|My husband and I play this most evenings for a bit just to relax. We got this as a free app of the day. Really like that there are no ads.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is such a great game and it is very entertaining. I have played many  great gameloft games and this is defiently one of them!
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|It is somewhat fun and challenging to play.  It takes awhile to save up for some of the major plays in the game.
0425263924|5.0|I REALLY love the CROSSFIRE series!! I didn't want to put the book down. I really hope there will be a Book 4 and 5.
B008I43DYU|5.0|I didn't know that this was available on Kindle.One more reason for me to love my Kindle fire.<br />I don't have to change gadgets.I can do my calculations right here. Thanks Amazon!
0606320873|3.0|World War Z isn't your average action-packed, zombie thriller. The chapters are a series of interviews with people around the world, describing how they (and/or their country/region) found out about, and responded to the zombie epidemic, which in traditional zombie fashion causes a person to become the \\"living dead\\" whose sole desire is to eat people, thus spreading it to others once bitten.<br /><br />The narrator of the book begins with the notation that these interviews were supposed to included in the government's official record of the event, but the govenrment only wanted facts, when the interviews were more personal accounts.<br /><br />Needless to say, it's a little dry. You aren't sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation. You aren't emotionally attached to any one character in the story. Not to say that it wasn't interesting, because I found it to be thought-provoking in a survivalist sort of way. Could this really happen?!? And if it does happen, how would the global powers respond? How would an individul's values impact how he/she responds? World War Z is one person's answers to these questions and it made me think about how I would attempt to survive such an event.<br /><br />While I found the book interesting in the same way I might be interested in various perspectives from any type of major catastrophic event, I do prefer to connect with the characters, so I only give it 3 stars.<br />[Disclaimer - I haven't watched the movie, if that matters.]
B004GYY714|5.0|I do enjoy the convenience of having the radio at my fingertips.I can access the stations that I love,<br />and the reception is wonderful.Don't know why I didn't get it before.
B00CS74W0C|4.0|this series was a toned down version of the Grey books, still very HOT yet the encounters were not as frequent  where you wanted to skip over them (hey I like icecream but 24 hours a day every day makes me want to skip my next serving) The crossfire books did not have that, i couldnt  wait for my next scoop to be served.. job well done Sylvia.!!
1451695195|5.0|I thought since it was written by a doctor that it would be hard to read, but it isn't. Very good.
B005HSL626|4.0|I had fun for a while but got bored soon afterwards.<br />There is not really any point to the game.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This was an easy read.  The concepts are made really simple.  I read parts of this to my 6 yr old and 2 yr old.  They now know the difference between an asset and a liability.  I wish I had read this when I first got out of college.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is great and people who give it one star have issues.<br />IT IS Awesome. I really like it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Fantastic! Was a heartwarming and emotional story that kept me reading. Couldnt put it down! Recommend to everyone! Definately a must read!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I just love this show! Can not wait to finish seasons two, three and four. Half way thru season two and it is hard to stop!
B0034G4P8A|5.0|It' fun, action packed, adventuresome, and has Chis Helmworth, whats not to like. I need 7 more words or they will not accept this review.....that should do it.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I ordered this movie for my 4 year old daughter and she loves it. She had never seen it before and I haven't seen it in a while. Now it's her favorite movie!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I first rented this movie and watched it on my laptop on a flight to portland because the plane didn't have any entertainment. I liked it so much I bought it on dvd.
0061733199|5.0|great book, its very interesting. it gives you tons of information and lots of different climates. i keep it in my BOB and read over it often.
B0018STVHQ|2.0|The acting is so poor in this film for the actors in it...maybe it;s the script but the historical background is also not very correct!
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great variety of games to play with your choice of tiles & backgrounds.  So far it's been the best game app I have added to my Kindle Fire & phone.
0802473156|5.0|Not that I got complete understanding of my wife just from reading this book but I did start to understand her better and what her love language is.  She and I are so happy and it is great!
B00CHMBQ0C|3.0|Purchased this on Blu-ray as I'm an avid fan of spy/secret agent thrillers. I had low expectations as previous reviews have bashed this movie. I like Aaron Eckhart as an action actor. He played the role well, however I think the script fell shy as if the writers had \\"writer's block\\" on some of lines. The movie has a nice Bourne feel as Aaron's character is dealing with a government conspiracy that pits him and his daughter against The CIA. The close combat sequences were well executed. Felt like he really was a \\"retired\\" special agent as he does get his a** handed to him a couple times. I enjoyed it and glad I could add it the collection. I just felt it was lacking in some parts so I give I a C+/B-.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Michael Jackson will always be the soul of pop music. He experimented with so many different genres and we shall never forget his amazing dancing. This entire album makes you want to dance and sing!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I was always looking forward for this movie to finally make it to the big screen, I love the interaction between characters, the action sequences, and just seeing the revival of old school characters making such a huge comeback. I was very pleased with this movie i will certainly be watching this movie over and over again!!!
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|For a late 90s sci-fi action movie Keanu Reeves gets away with being a star character. The Matrix was so innovative and kick-ass for its time.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I love this game. It is worth the money to buy the full version. Have played the adventure mode three times already.
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|when I got so far I was almost at the end but it erased my memory I mean WHAT THEE HECK
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I wanted to buy the book to support Jaycee, thought I'd have a hard time reading it...but I'm glad she survived this and can only wish the best for her and the girls...
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is so amazing and unusual from other books I have read. It makes you think about life more than ever before and to thank God everyday for what you have. It is tragic but makes me smile from the inside out at the same time. This book is defiantly worth your time. My family has experienced many deaths from cancer so I can relate some to how the characters felt, but then again I cant relate at all because i've never been this sick before. This book shows me how horrible cancer is and how hard cancer patients have to fight just to stay alive. Something most of us take for granted in life.
B00B69UQEO|4.0|Fantastic album, still fresh and full of songs which could be immediate classics! Depeche mode are shocking! So many great albums. There is not a single song that I don't like on this album. Not a masterpiece, but in the same vein of Violator, Ultra, Exciter, Playing the Angel.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I have been playing this game for awhile, love it, but don't like the way they have redone how you buy the power-ups. Costs more to buy and you get less. the game at times doesn't give you your credits, it will freeze up.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|This app is pretty sweet. Have you ever been listening to the radio, or watching tv and you hear a song you like but don't know what it's called. Then this app is for you because it solves that problem easily. I love being able to open it and know exactly what song I'm listening to. I have used it while playing classical music and it not only gives you the composer's name and song title but also which orchestra is performing. That to me is crazy! The only thing is you need to have a Wi-Fi connection or it doesn't work obviously. Love it! Get it and you will too.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Decent album, but not his best. Beats are good and the rhymes are pretty good. Magna Carter is way better.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Every game by mobility Ware is very good!!!!  Freecell and Solitaire are excellent also! I play them all everyday and enjoy them.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was wonderful reading.  If we use the word &#34;classic&#34; anymore, I would certainly apply it to this novel in its field.  Emotionally gripping, interesting, fanciful, creative and original.  I recommend this novel highly.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|If you haven't watched the series yet, you should get the whole set.  I loved this show and I miss watching it.  I wish they would have continued this series.
B004LROMWU|4.0|I love this series and just wanted it for my private collection.  We like watching shows more than once.  Love Noah Wylie he is a gifted actor.
B0043RGY60|5.0|I bought this Cd after buying 30STM current album LLF+D. I fell in love with it from beginning to end. My favorite tracks are Night of the Hunter, Hurricane, Closer to the Edge, Alibi and Stranger in a Strange Land.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this game while waiting for appointments or just to relax. It loads smoothly and I must admit I do use the hints.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Dark Archade: Carnival was a great game that would be fun for any level of experience with RPGs.  The graphics were great and the challenges  matched each level of play well.  I found Carnival to be a game I will enjoy many many times to come.
B00005V7CT|1.0|Couldn't get DVD to play in any DVR we tried so sent it back.  The DVD would play in the computer but didn't want to sit and watch it on the small screen.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It was free so I gave it a try.  My 6 and 8 year olds liked it well enough...but not so much to ask to use my tablet to play it again.
0385535147|5.0|One of John Grisham's best to date.  Kept your attention all the way through and was a real page turner.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I'm a grandma and I'm hooked on this series. Even if u think as I did, that the hunger games was for kids think again. It's riveting. U will be hooked too.
0385349947|4.0|She is saying in a contemporary voice what women have been advocating.<br />Rely on yourself, do not buy into the cultural restrictions that limit our goals.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game is impossible to do any thing. Anyway it is not even interesting.<br />There are so many better hairdressing games.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter is amazing! I love the story line for the season, though I assumed that he would have experienced more of an issue with the Deb situation
B008JFUQ3O|5.0|As stated in my earlier review for Despicable Me, this movie was on my 2013 must watch list. So after its near 3 week highly successful run, here is my review for: Despicable Me 2.<br /><br />Despicable Me 2 brings back Steve Carrell as everyone's favorite bad guy, Gru. Also returning are Miranda Cosgrove as Margo, Russell Brand as Dr. Nefario, and Elsie Fisher and Dana Gaier as Agnes and Edith. Newcomers to the movie include Benjamin Bratt as Eduardo, Moises Arias as Antonio, Steve Coogan as Mr Silas Ramsbottom, and although she played a minor role in the first film, Kristen Wigg portrays the lady with the lipstick, Lucy Wilde. The cast did an excellent job.<br /><br />The story line is highly enjoyable, not quite as charming as the first film in my opinion but still very enjoyable. There is the right amount of humor, the animation is well put together, and the minions (as always), are at it again.<br /><br />My complaint that it is not as memorable as the first is easily overlooked Thanks to Despicable Me 2 being so smart. It has the smarts, the fun, and still has the heart that made us fall in love with the original movie. I have a feeling that a 3rd sequel will be made in due time; while in the meantime, the minions themselves will be getting a movie all on their own in July of 2015. To close out my review If you have not seen this movie, What are you waiting for? GO SEE Despicable Me 2! I can guarantee and confirm that you and your family will have a blast.<br /><br />4.5 Stars
B00479SVBU|5.0|Have had 2 previous transmitters (other brands) that weren't worth a crap. This one is fantastic! Haven't used the remote yet because it really wasn't necessary for anything I wanted to do. I need to buy another for the wife's car. You really can't go wrong.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Once I started watching this show I was hooked. I love that Mike cares so much and Harvey secretly cares about other people but refuses to admit it. I can't wait to see what happens next.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love, love, love it! great game, easy game, exciting game, fun game, easy to solve with a little mystery and logic......
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Another terribly boring, predictable movie. Not worth watching. I turned it off after about half way through because it's so boring.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|cool game<br />one of the best games ever I love it awsome cool<br />realy cool awsome awsome I love it
B00ADQCBEY|2.0|Despite the critical acclaim and popularity of this show, I couldn't make it past a few episodes.  The lead character is a dirty cop, and if I'm going to watch something, I want the good guys to win.  There are enough bad guys winning on the news.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses but I've never been able to have one. On this app it's just like taking care of a real horse. You feed it, muck out the stables and even pick up poop! It's great!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great free fun! Simple game play with really good graphics and sound. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT. Fun...Fun...Fun. Go get it now.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game funnest game in the world need to get the game its so awesome and I'm very picky about stuff
B00122L1R6|4.0|I have always liked Mark Knopfler, especially in the Dire Straits era.  His solo work is good.  His unique talent on the guitar still shines through on most of the songs.  His voice is not what it used to be.  (Mine either).
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|Product arrived on time and works better than expected.<br />I am very please with the service and product. Very simple to hook up and got me back on line in no time.<br />Would recommend this product and company.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not read any thing Stephen King in a long, long, time.  This book is as good as any I've read by him.  It is more in the suspense genre than horror genre.  This book does pay homeage to the 50s and 60s like no other book I've read.  This book makes time travel fun, dangerous,suspenseful and exciting.  It is a page turner.
B0014KD46W|4.0|Steve Winwood was one of mig big favourites when he has with Traffic and Blind Faith. I have not followed his solo career very closely. I did enjoy the album \\" Arc of a Diver\\" though some songs tend to be somewhat lengthy. I really loved \\"Higher Love\\" from \\"Back in the High Life\\".<br /><br />On this album his sound is not unlike that of \\"Back in the High Life\\" and his vocals are as strong as ever.<br /><br />For me the problem with his music is that the songwriting isn't up to the standards of his early days; or you could say that there are fewer memorable songs.<br /><br />The standouts on this album are \\"Fly\\" and \\"Dirty City\\". \\"Fly\\" is one of the most melodic songs on the album, almost acoustic - a song that also would have fitted a singer like Van Morrison.<br /><br />\\"Dirty City\\" is the most rocking track, featuring great guitar playing from Eric Clapton.<br /><br />The opening track \\"I'm Not Drowning\\" is also quite strong.<br /><br />All songs are performed with the greatest musical competence, and on most numbers you can enjoy fine conga playing, and of course Winwood's strong vocals
B00D23GXB2|5.0|Revenge of the Orgasm. Greatest Poet Alive. GPA Media Inc. 2013.  64 pp.<br /><br />Revenge of the Orgasm written by GPA takes its readers into many hot and steamy erotic scenes. But these scenes are not fictitious by any means, all having been lived by the author who paints them. And paint them he does, giving enough detail to comprehend the poem, but divulging only enough that the reader must then add to the mental imagery. Genius!<br /><br />GPA does an excellent job of compiling more than 30 pieces of classy and sophisticated poems, telling each piece with sensuality and tact. Revenge of the Orgasm gives its readers more to think about in 64 pages than many authors can do in 300.<br /><br />A DEFINITE WINNER AND MUST READ by all. Revenge of the Orgasm will leave its readers satisfied...and hungry!<br />My favorite...\\"Chocolate, Powdered Sugar and Strawberries\\"... Want to know why...? Get your copy today!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|More fun than a barrel of monkeys, if that was possible. Worth playing. Do not believe me? Try for yourself.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun game  but  like every other game you have money but they have to add the stupid gems! Although unlike other games you can earn the gems pretty  easily but over  all ITS A GREAT GAME!!!!!!! I highly recommended this game
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Strategy and brains are needed for this plague simulation.  On the easiest setting, a game might take as little as ten to fifteen minutes.  The most challenging setting offers at least 90 minutes of game play, I have had a game go as long as 4 hours.  The simulation is engaging and realistic.  This is a great buy for someone who likes simulations.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this game is really different.  I enjoy playing it,  usually every day at least once. I recommend it to all my friends.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i got this app a.d now i cant stop playing it it gets more and more challenging amd another thing it is super super fun!!!!!!!!!!!
B007TK77QE|4.0|Two communities fighting for representation in a fictional area of Britain. Characters are well drawn and flawed, mostly unlikeable though.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|This movie is one of Disney and the Sherman brothers finest works. I am very excited to see &#34;Saving Mr. Banks&#34; this holiday season. The Quality of the film is great and it went all the way through without stopping on amazon instant video.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|This game made my day when I bought it. If you are looking for a medieval type tower defense game this is the game for you. It also has a few features that separate it from most tower defense games. And you don't have to spend more money ounce you enter the game, only the in game currency to buy upgrades and a few other items.<br /><br />Overall it is a wonderful strategy game!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I Loved the main character. She's completely messed up and  in a home for teenagers at the beginning of the story.  She slowly finds her way to happiness and spreads it to others through a beautiful journey of flower language. Beautifully written from beginning to end.
0670026603|5.0|Everyone can relate to this story, no matter how young or old. Provocative, sad, funny, heartwarming. I loved every line.
B000000OU0|5.0|.....and if you love the Eagles, then you will love this. I bought it as a gift and it was so well received the person bought tickets to the Hell Freezes Over concert!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Good well rounded game. Challenging and fun. Natural progression of difficulty. Knew nothing about Magic before playing but game does a very good job of teaching you what you need to know. Definitely worth the $10 to unlock the full game.
145210655X|5.0|The pictures in this book are adorable. Thankfully I bought it for my husband for fathers day since there are no words  in the book. We show it to our infant and make up stories, so this is a great book for creativity.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Enjoying this while on break my Facebook friends hate me for winning every game my road trips have gotten better
B00005YUR1|5.0|I did not realize when I first saw this film that I was seeing Nicolas Gage as a young man, this is a must have for me, it is a really good watch that I will enjoy forever and now I have my own, I do not have to watch the one from the library.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Well worth its reputation as a &#34;must read&#34; classic. Engrossing and thought provoking from begging to end. Well worth checking out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is the epitome of gripping. From the very first line I was hooked and anxious for more. The ending really makes me want to read the other silo books, so well done Hugh Howey. Such an imaginative story and very compelling characters that were easy to identify with. I hope when the movie comes out, if that is still in the works, that it is half as good as this because if it is then it will be great.<br /><br />-R.T. Edwins
B00B2G2RG6|4.0|Interesting story with many surprising twists. Kevin Bacon is great. Ending i thought was not as dramatic as i expected watching the entire show
0515142247|5.0|This story does not fail to deliver.  It is exciting, well written and difficult to put down once started.  Thanks!
1452110581|5.0|required reading! silly, funny, cute, ridiculous, odd, serious, real--  and  always so cat-like! that's it--no more words of praise&#34; required.&#34;
B003L77G8I|5.0|These programs just keep getting better.  They are well written, acting is great and the stories continue to entertain.  Thanks!
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Inspirational book blended with understanding life hardships and plenty of personal perspectives.  I would recommend this book to anyone going through a career change.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've actually had to stop listening to this because I have formed some sort of auditory addiction to hearing this album play on repeat. After I got it in the mail (yes, I waited), I listened to it on repeat for over a month before trying to break my addiction. I love this album. If you dig it or wish you dug it, go watch their videos for the songs and you'll likely love it move.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Only thing missing in plot is how they ultimately turn there pet peeves into a team. It's like magic.Must see
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love this series. I'm almost on book 3, and I usually end up reading while I walk anywhere, and reading myself to sleep, and reading on the bus...basically, I don't want to put it down. It's an awesome read, and even fun when you have the voices from the show to read you dialogue in your head. Recommended!
B007IK44CK|3.0|not a cruise fan, but loved the action and unique stuff that never, ever could happen in real life. and cruise's acting seems to just get worse.
B005MMZ63C|3.0|I like Orson Wells, but based on all the hype throughout the years for this film, I expected something better than what was presented. Maybe it has something for aspiring directors as far as camera angles, but if you want to watch a good movie that's entertaining and makes you think a little, this isn't it. If this is on your bucket list of films to watch, cross it off.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|love joss whedon and a few of the actors in here, so gave it a try. it was fun. and that's okay.
B003BW0CB6|3.0|A little confusing; jumping from one leading character to another. But I Will not give up on the author however.
0446672653|5.0|I read this, gave it to my best friend and now my daughter is reading it. Amazingly poignant and allowed me to forgive myself and accept I have lessons to learn in love and living.
B000SKWLRC|4.0|I did not see the product since it went directly to the third party I indicated.  However, I do know that buying and paying for it was simple; shipping was incredibly fast; and the third party is very pleased to have the book.  She is pre-reading it for school.
B008XG1X18|5.0|a place I can find what I want to look at when I want to look at it..like a customized photo album.check it out you will love it too!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read the entire series and have enjoyed it. It keeps your attention. I love having the kindle app because I can flip between reading it on my phone or tablet.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its actually good. it teaches you responsibility. it was a wide range of variety to pick from. and it keeps you busy.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is challenging and fun it can get frustrating lol it needs more levels as it gets addicting  quick leaving you wanting more
B000HEZF0O|4.0|If ur a fan of mission impossible you will enjoy this collection and be very proud of it. It is pricy which why o didn't give it 5 stars But that's opinion matter. It all depends on how much of a fan u are. The quality of video is obviously immaculate. So u will definitely enjoy it again and again.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|This show has something for everyone and will leave you on the edge of your seat straight through to the epic conclusion of Season 1.  This was my first time watching the Doctor in action and will definately be going right into Season 2.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|Great flick. Great quality and value.since I loved the movie. It was a defense 5 star rating for me. If u like action, Tom cruise. Ull love this combo.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A great read. Not too light and not too heavy.it's different enough to keep you wondering but thrilling enough to keep you going. Just read it you won't be disappointed. Now I must read the next book.
B001E45XT4|1.0|I bought this less than 2 years ago and it retailed 19.99..now at 59.99 this is junk,the hinges are cheaply made..Why this junk was inflated 40 bucks is beyond me but at that price I will buy a better design and name brand..How dare these sellers try to rip off consumers..They buy the headset for less than 20 because they retail at 20 and sell it for 60..Scam pros.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its pretty fun but can get boring after a while... oh well. that's life. I hate this word minimum. there.
B001F6ZIXW|4.0|Great to able to catch up so I can start following regularly. Enough action to keep everyone happy when watching.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|If you're looking for pop songs, look elsewhere.<br /><br />But this release by The National is coherent, beautiful, and, at times, moving.
B001P7HUF0|4.0|There are good guys and there are bad guys and not too many in between. Excellent casting with Devito as a stand out. I saw the movie when it first came out and recently watched it again. Good fun!
3836538725|5.0|Salgado has outdone himself. This is his masterwork. I've been reviewing my copy since the start of June and admire not only the photography, but the editorial, the design, the separate index (which makes is very easy to learn about each photograph without having to constantly flip back and forth from the front of the book to the rear of the book as is the case with so many art/photography books.) I've bough copies for friends simply because I don't want my closes friends to NOT experience this work. This is a must for everyone -- not just photographers and art book collectors, but for every citizen of our planet. What a captivating work of art paying tribute to earth, nature and mankind. I believe this will be considered one of the masterworks of photographic publishing of all time. Buy this book. Every family and household should have a copy available for their children to explore.
B00BD62X14|4.0|I like this album as well as anything she has done so far. Very listenable. I enjoy her style and the CD does not sound overproduced.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app really makes you think about how  to search for and use the clues that are hidden on each floor. Excellent product and extremely entertaining!
140006922X|1.0|Glad I did a little research before buying. Just know before you buy: 1) author is Muslim, 2) author is not a historian.
B005NFJAMG|4.0|Great movie.  Suspense and thriller, keeping you guessing who the good guys are and who is going to survive.  Some really scary moments without excessive gore.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best James Bond ever.  Daniel Craig is the best.. with Sean Connery following very closely behind him.  This movie is by far the best James Bond of the three Daniel Craig movies..  I can't wait for the next one.  The only thing that will top Daniel Craig as James Bond will be when I take over the role.
B00AEFY44Y|5.0|A love story.  Not much else needs to be said with the stars Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore in the leads with an outstanding performance by Whoopi Goldberg.  Just get the box of tissues, invite friends of a same mind and enjoy an evening at home.  Contains wonderful moments of humor too.
B00BR476TG|5.0|I liked the preview so much I purchased the movie it had such a lot of symbolism in it a lot of veiled meanings in it .
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Interesting story and very believable.  It was hard to put the book down wondering what would happen next.  Great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Probably the best app I have ever gotten!!!!!!!: ) It has all of the key elements to have a blast!!!!!! I totally &lt;3 this app!!! No flaws!!!!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I thought the main character was a nut when I started reading her story, but it was captivating and interesting.
B0051MKNV8|4.0|It's a movie about drugs, superpowers and addiction what more do you want. You have to ignore almost everything you know about modern science and drug metabolism to enjoy this movie. If you don't know any of that to begin with then just take it for what it is...a movie to entertain you. Will it win any award for being amazing, not a chance but it does what it needs to and that's make you go. Damn I wish I had that pill,
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Such a cute, modest movie where women were women and men were men. I can watch it by myself or torture husband and kids with it!
B00005R24K|5.0|I've seen this movie at least 10 times now and it never gets old. It's a must watch on my Halloween list and sometimes just when I need a good smile. It's campy, low budget, bad acting at it's finest.
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Our whole family (of 8) end up singing her songs because they are relatively clean lyrics and kind of catchy.
B004A8ZX28|1.0|Cashing in on the fact that Taken was a great movie we put Liam in another scenario that's completely forgettable. Don't waste time or money.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|I have been playing it for a couple weeks, now all of a sudden it won't load. Been trying to play all day, but says it can't connect to network. It also drained my pearls a couple days ago, I had like 5 then poof, next time I was on they were gone. Hope they fix it soon.
B00AIBZM40|3.0|I'm a fan of anything horror so I may be bias in saying the movie lacked the creep factor. It had some decent tension and good acting but it didn't build upon any of it. It just sort of introduces a character and plot within the first 15 min then drags it through the mud for another 60+minutes. Wait for Netflix to get it.
B004LWZW42|4.0|I love, love this movie. I only wish the extras were on the DVD and not just the Blu Ray, however, as I feel like fans miss out a lot of stuff on those extras and I honestly don't understand the point of Blu Ray. Oh well.
B009XTF8JM|3.0|It's not an award winning movie by any means or intention. Rent it or wait for Netflix to pick it up.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Love this book and can`t wait for the second book that comes out in January. Pre-ordered it on my kindle. A very cool story and inventive. Don`t know if it is anything like it around.
B004XQO90O|4.0|This movie was a lot better than I had expected. It kept me engaged and the ending was the best part.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|love the whole set.  i haven't tried the ultraviolet thingy yet but the dve was great.  rec'd quickly and as promised.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Easy read that's fun and kind of mindless. Not much attention required but worth the 2-3 days you might spend on it.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|this was a good book, I liked it, I loved parts of it, but it was a little too quick a read for me.
B001609SQA|5.0|This movie was state of the art sci-fi when it came out,and is still considered one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. All the alien movies are epic sci-fi masterpieces,with plenty of action and very good storyline and  acting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game I can't put it down.<br /><br />Everyone should try to play it and I guaranty that you'll love it.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|I really like this app it was just what I was looking for. I also like all the different notebook covers you have to choose from
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I read The Kite Runner and I felt that that was a better book than this one.  I enjoyed And the Mountains Echoed but it did not have the heart wrenching characters that The Kite Runner explored.

0307476073|5.0|Wild is a brutally honest and soul-searching journey.  Cheryl Strayed has accomplished something most author's have not:  she has bared her soul in a way that touches her readers' souls.  What she experienced in her young adult life can relate to so many other young people trying to understand their purpose in this world.  Reading this as a 50+ adult, I can relate to many of her ponderings of just what brings meaning to our lives.  Thank you, Cheryl, for taking us on this journey of yours which is, also, a journey of our own.

B00DGMVJAO|4.0|a good new twist on jack and the bean stalk. we watched it a few times as it was a 48 hour rental. lots of action.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|This book is for everyone who gets to the end of eight (or ten) hours at work, feeling that they've been very busy and accomplished little to nothing.<br /><br />Keller and Papasan suggest blocking out four hours first thing in the morning to work on The ONE Thing -- the single activity that will make everything else better or easier. This isn't a wild idea. Many readers will respond with immediate agreement: if we could focus on that super-important thing, we could get a lot more accomplished.<br /><br />This book gives insight into how you can actually do that.<br /><br />Section 1 examines false beliefs we hold. Do you think you can multitask? You're wrong. Do you think that getting things done is all about willpower and discipline? Nope. This section will convince you that a little discipline on the front end will result in positive habits that won't require willpower. Overcome the six unhelpful ideas about time management and strategic planning that so many of us share:<br /><br />* Everything matters equally<br />* Multitasking<br />* A disciplined life<br />* Willpower is always on will-call<br />* A balanced life<br />* Big is bad<br /><br />Section 2 helps you determine the ONE Thing in your life, and in each area of your life.<br /><br />Section 3 helps you overcome the obstacles that keep you from focusing on that most important thing. Some of this section involves tips -- get your coffee before you start so you don't end up losing time in the coffee room chatting with coworkers -- and some are more philosophical, like the concept of \\"the mastery approach.\\"<br /><br />It's all an entertaining and inspiring read, and the chances are good that, if you follow the advice in this book, you will be able to get that highly productive block of work time into your day.<br /><br />If you're new to time management, start with this book. If you're frustrated by your current approach to time management, give this a shot.

B008XCM18Q|4.0|This book was written in the early 80s so the writing style is quite different from modern spy novels.  You also have to get past the obvious gap in technology between now and then.

140006922X|5.0|This scholarly unbiased work is the best narrative of the historical jesus out in modern times a real page turner. I never write reviews but the hate and the mere fact that most of the reviewers have not even touched the book of forced me to write this review. Most of negative reviews merely attack the Harvard school divinity graduate for being a Muslim instead of actually saying anything negative about the works in question (a clear ad hominien)<br />Thomas Jefferson once took two king james bibles and cut out the fiction, miracles, contridictions, fairy tales including any story of jesus being God. Leaving only the moral code and declared it the greatest work s of right and morality ever written.<br />Effectively Aslan takes Jesus out of the context of the hard to understand fairy tale and presents him in the real world. Jesus in Zealot uniquely tells the story Jesus how anyone would have viewed him if they lived during that time. There fore if u would like to know accurately the story Jesus instead of the myth this is a must read.<br />P.s discouraging others from reading the book because the author wrote about Jesus while being Muslim is like saying don't listen to Jesus when he talks about Christianity because he was a Jew :O

B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I had a lot of trouble getting through this book.  The plot was inane and didn't involve a murder on the Cote d'Azur, despite the title.  The characters had no depth and I couldn't find even one that I liked.  The author even seemed to have problems herself describing her main character Maggie Newberry.  In the beginning, Maggie was described as having \\"large, green eyes\\" and just a few pages later was described with \\"eyes a pale blue.\\"<br /><br />There were also problems with transitions that drove me crazy at first.  The easiest way to transition from one setting and character to another is to have a chapter break.  However the author (Susan Lewis) often went with an extra blank line only.  When it first happened, I thought there were pages missing from the book--it just made no sense to jump to a totally different time and subject without a sentence or so of explanation.  By about the third time this happened, I realized I wasn't missing any pages, just a reasonable transition.<br /><br />I was terribly disappointed by the end, and didn't even bother reading the fairly long preview of the next novel in the series that was included with this book.  Instead I deleted the book from my Kindle, and can't recommend it at all.

B000ATQYT2|4.0|Honestly the world didn't need yet ANOTHER adaptation of A Christmas Carol, but if it had to happen this is a pretty good one. It sticks impressively close to the original text, adding in elements that many adaptations leave out (such as the rapid aging of the Ghost of Christmas Present.) Some of the Muppets are slightly out of character, having been manipulated to fit the role they have in the story rather than the role being changed to fit the Muppet, but it flows so well you'll barely notice. This also marks the first pairing of Gonzo and Rizzo as a double act and it's a great start to a lovely relationship.

It has very little in common with the movie.Go on, give it a go- you will not be disappointed.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This has easily become my favorite book of all time. Amazingly well written, poignant, and humorous, it's a thoughtful book that will appeal to both Young Adults and Adults, which is a rarity.<br /><br />The characters and writing make this book stand out from the rest. John Green is clearly a master writer, who knows how to twist words and sentences into beautiful prose. The main protagonists, Hazel Grace and Gus Waters are characters that you will never forget. He depicted them so beautifully, that you feel like you know them and ache for them by the end of the book. And also, you will find yourself quoting all the memorable lines from the book, such as &#34;My thoughts are like the stars, which I cannot fathom into constellations.&#34;<br /><br />This book is required reading for EVERYONE who enjoys a good story. It reminds you of why you love reading in the first place.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This is a good summer escape movie.  If you like super hero movies you will like The Avengers.  Builds off previous Captain America, Iron Man, and Thor movies.  In my opinion it is better than Thor and comparable to Captain America and the Iron Man films.

B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|\\"Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth\\" says it all.  In the author's mind, Jesus was a rabid zealot, determined to bring about the kingdom of God by force.  Every page in the book seeks to justify this predetermined condition.  Like so many, many others before him, he carefully selects out-of-context verses from the old and new testaments to prove his point.  An example: He quotes Matthew 12:38 as saying \\"It is an evil and adulterous generation that seeks a sign; no sign shall be given it\\" -- which is the wrong verse!  If this \\"scholar\\" was honest he should have quoted Matthew 12:39-41 which say \\"But he answered them, \\"An evil and adulterous generation asks for a sign, but no sign will be given it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. For just as Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.  The people of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, because they repented when Jonah preached to them - and now, something greater than Jonah is here!\\" (Here Jesus is referring to the time between his death and resurrection.)  When the need arises he provides his own inaccurate and totally misleading translation. Apparently millennia of scholarship and academic integrity aren't sufficient when you have a personal agenda.<br /><br />Forty percent of the way through the book come these statements: \\"There may be no more important question than this for those trying to pry the historical Jesus away from the Christian Christ.  The common depiction of Jesus as an inveterate peacemaker who \\"loved his enemies\\" and \\"turned the other cheek\\" has been built mostly on his portrayal as an apolitical preacher with no interest in or, for that matter, knowledge of the politically turbulent world in which he lived.  That picture of Jesus has already been shown to be a complete fabrication.\\"  By whom?  The author, of course.  He alone knowsthe true Jesus; everybody else is an idiot.<br /><br />Reza Aslan is a talented writer and the book gives a vivid account of life in greater Palestine in the time of Jesus.  The violence of the Romans, the hypocrisy of the temple elite, and the suffering of the masses may be exaggerated but they make for an exciting read.  They also serve to put forth the author's not-so-hidden agenda that his readers are ignorant of the truth, but that he is here to set us all on the right path.  It's very sad that he can write this biography  of Jesus Christ and so miss the mark of who his protagonist really is.<br /><br />As a historical read it's a moderate success.  As a biography it's a complete failure.
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|So I put off reading this book for a long time because I'm not a big fan of overly done fairytale retellings, but the lure to read a YA Cyberpunk lured me in. And, boy, am I glad it did! This book is fast-paced, electrifying, on the edge of your seat good.<br /><br />The main characters are so likeable, that I hurt along their hurt, laughed along with their laughter. The bad guys (or gals) were so detestable, that I cringed every time they made an appearance, yet couldn't look away, like watching a car wreck.<br /><br />Ms. Meyer's writing was so beautiful and alive. After reading a few books that frankly I couldn't finish due to the poor writing, I found Meyer's voice refreshing.<br /><br />I'm so glad I don't have to wait for SCARLET. Coming late to the party after that crazy cliffhanger was way worth it!
140006922X|4.0|My reading of Reza Aslan's Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth<br /><br />Since Aslan's book appeared in mid-July 2013, it has attracted a great deal of press. First of all, I should acknowledge that in my graduate studies in religion, I have had four courses that cover the area of his book and have read many of the books listed in the bibliography first hand. I can state right off that Aslan has done his homework and has made careful use of the scholarship of Amy-Jill Levine, E.P. Sanders, John Collins, Adela Collins, John Dominic Crossan, among others. For those who have never inquired into the scholarship called \\"The Historical Jesus,\\" a thread within scholarship that reaches back into the  18th century with Friedrich Schleiermacher and the 19th century with Albert Schweitzer, his approach, methods, and conclusions may seem a bit foreign. His book is well within the vein of that tradition. Some reviewers have postulated that his conversion to Islam may have lead him to downplay the divinity of Jesus. Those familiar with the tradition of Historical Jesus scholarship will know that the divinity of Jesus is not really what the method is interested in uncovering. Stated explicitly, the method is to uncover the Jesus of history, NOT the Christ of faith. The Jesus of history vs. the Christ of faith is a major dividing line in this kind of study. Scholars such as Rudolf Bultmann thought that the early church developed the words and traditions of Jesus whole cloth; other scholars such as Luke Timothy Johnson--not included in the book references--dispute that it is possible to uncover the Jesus of history and instead urge the acceptance of the Christ of faith instead. Alsan is not writing a faith book, although it is clear he has commitments to Jesus. By the way, as a good Muslim, he would have commitments to Jesus--a fact that some reviewers who know little about Islam fail to acknowledge.<br /><br />Aslan holds a Master of Theological Studies and a PhD in religion. He is no lightweight. Personally, I do wish he had used footnotes, but instead opted for an acknowledgment of the scholarship he is drawing on in the note's section of his book. The book strikes me in large measure as the distillation of a good deal of Historical Jesus scholarship seen through the lens of E.P. Sanders' The Historical Figure of Jesus and post-colonial studies. He gives a rather engaged view of the state of Second Temple Judaism and places the development of the Jesus tradition in the context of experience after 70 AD/CE. Scholars date the gospels after that point, with the understanding that Mark is first, then Matthew and Luke, and finally John. This is hardly controversial; it's basic textbook. Since he also has a background in creative writing, his description of the historical setting is dramatic. I'll bet the burning of the Temple in 70 CE was dramatic too! Many a modern Jewish person has cried at a certain wall in Jerusalem in grief. His Jesus is not Luke's rabbi Jesus, but instead a poor illiterate Palestinian Jew. He disputes some stories in the gospels. For the record, a good number of 19th and 20th century scholars have debated Jesus' reading at the synagogue at Capernum and his discussion with the teachers in the Temple as a boy.<br /><br />Let me quote his last paragraph on pages 215-16:<br />\\"Two thousand years later, the Christ of Paul's creation has utterly subsumed the Jesus of history. The memory of the revolutionary zealot who walked across Galilee gathering an army of disciples with the goal of establishing the Kingdom of God on earth, the magnetic preacher who defied the authority of the Temple priesthood in Jerusalem, the radical Jewish nationalist who challenged the Roman occupation and lost, has been almost completely lost to history. That is a shame. Because the one thing any comprehensive study of the historical Jesus should hopefully reveal is that Jesus of Nazareth--Jesus the man--is every bit as compelling, charismatic, and praiseworthy as Jesus the Christ. He is, in short, someone worth believing in.\\"<br /><br />Becoming a predominately Gentile religion by late in the 1st century into the 2nd, the Church adopted Paul's vision of crucified and resurrected Jesus and that became the focus of history. Paul was never interested in Jesus as a teacher or thinker. In that point, Aslan is right.<br /><br />A warning: If you are a biblical literalist, Aslan is going to be a problem because he will point out myriad problems in the gospels and discrepancies--all of which are there and are often smoothed over by churches I have found. Aslan, I think, provides a significant way of looking at those challenges, but you can't walk away holding biblical inerrancy--an idea that did not develop until roughly 150 years ago as a reaction to the rise of modern critical approaches to the Bible and to the advances in 19th century science. Even good ole John Calvin and Martin Luther did not believe in inerrancy, but Archibald Alexander and Charles Hodge did! Maybe Aslan is the new E.P. Sanders for this decade of the 21st century. Time will tell. It will stay on my shelf.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have enjoyed Hosseini's previous novels and went into this with high expectation. I was not disappointed. Hosseini weaves a rich tale with complicated characters and intriguing sub plots. Couldn't put this one down or stop thinking about it after I finished it.
140006922X|3.0|I cannot give this a glowing review yet, because quite honestly, I have not read the entire book. And frankly, I suspect not many people slamming this have. A few points here:<br /><br />1)How did some decide that this is without scholarship? Did one read the author's acknowledgments or look at the bibliography section? It looks rather well-researched to me. Talking about how this comes out purely out of the Quran sounds more scholarship-less to me.<br /><br />2)Reza Aslan does not have to be a historian to write what what he did. Some great historical accounts of events have come from authors who are NOT \\"historians\\".<br /><br />3)I'm not going to fault a Muslim or anyone for writing a historical account of Jesus. I don't have to agree with everything that is written, but non-Muslims (good Christians and all)have written about Islam and its Prophet for centuries.<br /><br />As a Christian, I confess that when I first learned this book was published, my own thought was \\"Oh great! Yet another book to tell me that what I believe is not real.\\" That thought was very quickly supplanted with another thought: I do not need this book to tell me what I believe is real or unreal, and that is not what Reza Aslan is telling us as Christians that we should do. As Christians, we either can let this add to our belief or not let it affect it at all. Quite frankly, much of the criticism of this book really speaks more to our own behavior as Christians than it does to the author of this book.<br /><br />I wonder how many here hated \\"Mysteries of the Bible\\" as much as this.<br /><br />I hope to read on when it becomes available to me.

B00C7O8TSM|5.0|My wife and I saw the Boys on this tour in an outdoor venue in Eugene, Oregon, on a perfect summer night. (Note: there are no more perfect summer nights anywhere in the continental US than in the Pacific Northwest. Trust me on this.) They were in great form, and their backup band was top notch.  I'm sure there has been some studio sweetening and editing applied to these live tracks, but in my memory, they sounded just like this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is seriously amazing. I love all the puzzles, and I can't wait for the next part to come out. To put it simply &quot;Give me more!!!!!&quot;
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|I love re living these shows, brings me back to times as a kid watching with my dad. Now that I am older, I can understand the stories behind the stories too!
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|As with some of the other reviewers, I was a bit suspicious about all the five star ratings, so I kind of brushed this book off for a while, but the damn thing kept coming up on recommendations, so I finally bought it. I wish I had done it sooner.<br />Very good stuff, totally worth the read. I give it my highest praise: Buy this book!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I wish we could get better results with the seeds since they cost pearls and we should be able to visitmore random users of this app to get better per ks otherwise wonderful app
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very well done and engaging.  Can't wait for the next game in the series. Hopefully it will continue with the same attention to detail.
140006922X|1.0|It's basically a Muslims opinion of Christ (they don't like him); has absolutely no historical base what so ever.<br /><br />I wouldn't waste time or money on this; and I'm glad I borrowed this from a friend.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Really enjoyed the series.  Ending felt very unfinished and lacking.  Wish there had been a mini-movie to wrap up everything in a more cohesive fashion.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this one down!! I had hoped for more...I was still thinking about what happened next for days.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Most of us have spots in our own homes where the wireless is unreliable or dead.  This simple app helps you find the sweet spots in any building or outdoor area.before you start reading or working.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Did not expect the love story.  It is a good family movie and I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B007IYWY3C|4.0|This is a great CD song wise but the mastering appears to be compressed more then other unplugged CDs I have purchased.  I still prefer this to the studio versions of Florence & Machine efforts which are even more compressed.
B00632HWOG|4.0|The four-star rating is given to this app because it is very reliable. As it is not perfect, the app does its job very well and with not much hassle. The text is readable and the interface is easy to use, though it does change often with updates. It is a simple app and is worth having if you need to check your e-mails in a hurry.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Individual stories of people in Afghanistan, France, and the US told as they interlace in unexpected ways over the decades.  Love Hosseini's writing--so evocative of a different time, place, and culture.
B000EULJLU|5.0|I was astonished to see so many low reviews, so I read a bunch of them. There are some well thought out reasons and some pathetic drivel. I'm addressing the former here, the drivel will always be drivel.<br /><br />No, 10,000 days is not as overall heavy as earlier albums. Is it less powerful? No way. As a band grows and matures their style is going to mature with them. I've been a fan for a long time, and I have to say that I love everything Maynard is involved with. Puscifer took a little bit of getting used to but it's now some of my favorite stuff. I still love the aggressive style of tool, but 10,000 days is a more subtle form of powerful than their earlier stuff. I wish the rest of the music industry had 1/10th the lyrical ability that Maynard and everyone else that collaborates with him does.<br /><br />Ultimately, people reading these reviews are going to already be Tool fans and either have already heard the music and decided for themselves or are going to listen no matter what. Any crazy reviews either for or against are only a measure of the appreciation or disappointment of existing fans.<br /><br />Me, I can't get enough, and I don't expect Tool to always be like they were in Undertow or Aenima. They're not the same band they were then... they're not the same PEOPLE they were then and this isn't the same WORLD as it was then. to me a 1-star review is something I'd give to Justin Beiber or some other crap. Even if you don't like this particular flavor, does it REALLY warrant 1 star?
B0064X7FVE|4.0|They have a lot of info and I'm grateful for it, the only draw back is the system they added to ask question it a pain where a pill can't reach. Other than that great
0525478817|5.0|I gave this to my niece for Christmas and she has read it probably 10 times in 4 months. She is 15/16 yrs.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I like it and I'm sure my son will to. the Mrs likes it as well dogs cats and a fish
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Very nice, and could be improved upon. I love the simplicity of the controls. I have not needn't able to connect to anyone online yet also. Not sure if that is a bug or if nobody is playing.
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|I really like this book. It makes me happy inside - happy in a very sad way.<br />Thank you, Sylvia Plath.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. Every time I think that I will play something else I end up back on this. Much harder on some levels then I thought it ever would be.
B006LSZECO|1.0|The concept of this book was good. The execution fell short. I predicted the &#34;plot twists&#34; and didn't even want to finish the book. I finished the book just to see how it ended. I actually liked the ending but the whole book could have been done better.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this because I know many people who have used this dvd. Works well I got a great work out. Would be better if I actually did it every day.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I uninstalled it. It was just not challenging enough.  Perhaps if I had kept going, but wasn't worth the trouble.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|The first time I read this book was when I was in high school. I was laughing so hard the teacher they took the book from me. 11 years later I decided to read this book again and it is still amazing. Still funny and I realized all the things I missed. Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett are masters at their craft and I wish they would write more books like this together!
B006BQNJR8|1.0|Truly bad film, across the board.  I was looking to kill two hours and this actually made them pass slower.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|James Rollins always delivers a thoughtful convoluted and fascinating plot, and his characters are folks you cheer for. Excellent read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is a great book and really kept my interest.  I really had no idea how it was going to end.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|I buy and sell on eBay and this makes it easy to check the status of things without going to the desk top computer. I make good use of this app.
140006922X|5.0|There was a time when being banned in Boston was guaranteed to produce a winner.  Now we have the Christian Taliban coming out in force to condemn a book mostly without addressing it's content.  This means a winner for sure and Aslan will sell many more copies of this book thanks to them.  I was ambivalent when I watched him interviewed about the book.  But as I have read more here and around the web, I have rushed to get my copy.<br /><br />Christ has no meaning unless you understand the times that produced him.  And because there is actually no contemporary record written of him while he was alive or shortly after his death, there are those who postulate he was a mythical creation and not a historical person.  True believers, zealots, really don't care.  If he was not real they would have to invent him.<br /><br />I will be reading ZEALOT and Josephus' ANTIQUITIES OF THE JEWS simultaneously.<br /><br />In addition I will be reading all the one and two star reviews on Amazon to get a refresher on Tea Party Christianity.
B00CKOYVG8|2.0|I am a fan of Angry Birds but there are too many ads and interruptions. The basic game is OK for me.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I liked the old weather.com app on my Kindle Fire, but the new version hangs, runs slowly, is cumbersome to navigate. The AccuWeather app could use some user interface improvements, but it's a darn sight better than the new weather.com. I like it!
B003F48E4W|5.0|Embodies what was actually good about the 80's, with an exceptional soundtrack. The cast really pushed me to give it five stars rather than four. It's not in the pantheon of &#34;great movies,&#34; but it's a great movie for its genre and period.
B00A4TKDKY|3.0|I have mixed feelings on this album.  The live material that is here is fantastic, but only clocks in at a little over a half hour in length.  3 additional studio tracks round out the album.  They are all decent songs, but I would rather have had a full cd's worth of live material to go by.  All that being said, the 8 live tracks that are here are all scorching blues that Guy, even in his 70's, can still kick out better than many younger men.  Having just seen Guy live a few months ago, I think the material here captures the essence of this shows.  I have seen some reviews that criticize the album for the stage banter, but when you go see Buddy live he tends to talk all through the show.  It is all part of it.  Of course his guitar playing is still top notch and his singing voice is still in great shape.  He mixes original material with several cover on this one which again, is pretty much what you see and hear when you go to a concert.  The 3 studio tracks are all pretty good and similar to what he did on his last studio release \\"Living Proof\\".  My only gripe is the shortness of the live material.  I would rather have a 60 to 70 minute live CD of this show rather than the EP's worth of stuff that you get here.  For that I can only give the album 3 stars.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Highly recommend this book. Ken follet is an extraordinary historical fiction writer. The characters are extremely well developed and of great relevance from a historical perspective. You won't be able to put this one down!
B006S01GH2|2.0|English subtitles. Would be much better if I knew the language. I didnt totally read the description on the movie
B009DCOU9S|5.0|At first glance I thought this game would be cheeses but for 99&cent; I figured what the neck I'll give it a shot. Great game challenging puzzles without being impossible.
B005HE5J7I|5.0|History the easy and fun way, wonderful fictional stories, with just the right amount of humor, showing the lives and times of London's rich history.  Readers will learn history well without realizing it, as the stories are so gripping.  If only educators used Edward Rutherfurd's &#34;methods&#34; of teaching, their jobs would be shamelessly easy and richly rewarding.  If you read one in the series (the order doesn't matter), you will hunger for more.  &#34;London,&#34; or &#34;Sarum&#34; by the same author.  &#34;Russka&#34; is next for me.
193700788X|4.0|I enjoyed the series and this book.  It wraps up a lot of the plot lines, but not quite all.  There is another book coming out in the fall that is supposed to be a \\"what happened after\\" for the characters so I guess the remaining plot lines will be wrapped up at that point.
0345803507|5.0|GREAT BOOK! These books were like Disney Princess stories for ADULTS! Can't wait for the movie. Trust me Buy it... &#34;Later's Baby&#34;!
B0037NVM2C|5.0|Perhaps it was because this was the director's cut, but the T-800 (Arnold) had significantly more personality. I suppose this made then ending somewhat more poignant. My reviewing was mostly spurred by reading some news of Edward Furlong's life since. I hope things work out for him.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|This is a great story, good suspense.  The book is an interesting story of teens working together and getting results.
B008OOYALE|3.0|If you use anything but a kindle and a ipad think twice befor getting this game. It will restart a mission after you complete it, and it is very lagy. So think twice.
B00CZAYOWI|5.0|I love The Cult.  I have no use for CDs.  They are in the same category as 8 Tracks in my book...  So I have to purchase this CD then rip it to MP3 to listen to?  Old school.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|Really great show! I really enjoyed it. It is well acted and suspenseful and thought provoking. I got kind of addicted.
B00DHNB5CY|5.0|Awesome, gruesome movie! Not too deep, but deeply enjoyable. Would definitely recommend for horror movie enthusiasts.  Oh, there's so much blood.
1416914293|5.0|Loved this book a great sequel to  The City Of Bones, can hardly wait to read the rest of the series
1400069289|3.0|This book is good from a intellectual standpoint but I was extremely disappointed in its practical application.Its approach was clinical and I was looking for a more systematic personal approach.
B00CUB5PNY|4.0|Liked the levels of this game, although enough time wasn't give for the higher levels . It felt like you would never be able to finish the levels in the allotted time
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app makes looking after horses fun. All you have to do is tap the screen and have fun. I'm almost 16 years old and love this app.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater.  I made it a part of my collection for my use and the enjoyment of my grandchildren.  It has a number of important themes in it and they are bought through in a fun way.  The story rocks!  Frank Bartlett
B00D3XAA4M|1.0|Complete waste of a download/purchase.  Just pictures, no good information to help a traveller.  Not recommended.  Other Lonely Planet guides have been helpful but not this one.
B001TH16DI|5.0|My husband was surprised when I got him this collection for him. We watched a few movies together to enjoy the the memories of the old Star Trek gang.
0670026182|5.0|I love the unstructured and creative look.The pictures and content are so interesting, it is also full of good advice, and knowledge.
1439153663|5.0|This was both an educational and an enjoyable book to read. You just wanted to keep reading - hard to put down.
B009GED3HS|5.0|Best show on tv for twenty-something's to watch. You will laugh until you cry and cry until you laugh. Acting couldn't be better. All the characters are unforgettable.
B008220C56|2.0|With all this beautiful music it was wasted with this crazy story line. The costumes were beautiful, but trying to watch this movie was as enjoyable as going to the dentist.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Love the suggestions made and have found that they are accurate.  It's great to have other travelers input as well.
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Sabbath has been my favorite band all my life and I am super impressed that after all these years they put out such a super album. Long time fans will love it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|not too bad standard time killing game. works well, and doesn't pitch too much pay to play crap. which is nice.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not too hard. Not too easy. Looking forward to more levels. Would play similar games by same company. Nice to play when you want something a little more challenging.
B001NAT05W|3.0|I like these kind of movies for the most part, that being said, this one totally dumbs down the audience and was almost painful to watch
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|I thought this book was very entertaining. I've heard the audio version is even better because it's in her own voice.
B008PE9GSA|4.0|While most of the songs rehash riffs you've heard them play before ,the  Texas boogie formula is tried and true ! I'll tell you what it sounds like; it sounds like the lil' ol' band from Texas can still send it !!!
B00BESCJII|4.0|Watched this with my 17 year old daughter who REALLY liked it.  Good perspective into adolescent behavior.  Worth watching definitely
B00065MDRW|5.0|Truly one of the most important groundbreaking albums of all time . This package with the extras is great !
B00CHILW64|4.0|Very moving but difficult to watch - Great suspense considering I knew at the outset that this family made it.
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is a fun filled action movie. Amusing plot, lots of humor, continuous action and likable characters. If you're looking for an entertaining action film you'll enjoy this movie.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|It is vary fun. I like the noises they make. So lucky its free. Its worth 1.99 or somthing. You make rolle coasters and use cute aminals to put in the train and control them to the finish
0062255657|5.0|Love his work and found this one to be very enjoyable as well. An easy quick read for adults and young adults.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|As with each of the A Song of Ice and Fire books I can't put it down.  I'm sucked in from page one.  Now you have to understand that although I'm an avid reader I've never read any set of books that so totally absorbed me for hours.  Oh, by the way, did I mention that I;m 75 years old, a mother, a grandmother, and wife?  Got my daughter reading them and now my husband, who is 76.  Of course my grandson had already read all of them long before my hairdresser recommended the series to me.  Anyway, I love the set.
0812550706|5.0|I had heard of this novel several years ago and finally thought I'd give it a read. I enjoyed it so much that I ordered the entire Ender's  series. It's up to the next generation to solve many of this generations problems and I'm glad there are writers that write to the younger readers, although every adult should read this. You will love or hate it, there seems to be no in-between among readers for this novel.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this app made you think but not frustrating or to easy . great way to kill some time. can't. wait for more floors
B003U4UNPK|5.0|Love the whole series. Watched it while it ran on tv and now watching again on my prime. If you have never watched this series, I recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I had a lot of fun with this app. Not to hard, not to easy. Looking forward to more levels. Nice visuals.
B00AAQRNQ8|3.0|Not a bad mouse, has a load of buttons and the setup is pretty easy. Like everyone else said its shame that you don't get a CD with the software on it and have to download it. The mouse itself feels alright, not too sturdy but not like its made out of plastic. Its VERY light but the weights that come with it help out fairly well. The software itself is pretty simple and very nice to use.<br /><br />My biggest problem is when I change ANYTHING about the mouse, using the software that your supposed to, it constantly resets the mouse speed. It doesn't change the mouse DPI in the software, but the actually pointer speed on your computer. Every time I change anything whether its the light on it or a button, I have to constantly open up my computer preferences and change the mouse pointer speed. I emailed Anker about the bug but have not gotten any feedback.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game an anxiously await the release of more rooms! Everyone I have shown this game to also downloads it. It is challenging without being too difficult.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this as compared to temple run. The kids love it more as well! I'm glad this is available for kindle now.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was such a great story I couldn't put it down when I had the opportunity to read and couldn't stop thinking about it when I wasn't able to read!
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I gave as a gift to my friend  in Brazil and  she love it! I will recommend as personal or as a gift :)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This story draws you in, and you can't stop reading.  Probably written for a teen or young adult reader, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Loved this book. It started out a little slow for me but I am glad I kept reading!<br />Well done, cannot wait for your next book!
B004ADF7RO|1.0|It's amazing how bad a movie can be, almost 30 years later. I thought it would be a great family movie. I thought I remembered laughing, crying & being a little scared when I first saw it at about 6. So, I thought my kids, being 8 & 9, would be the perfect age. Wrong! I can't believe the bad language & sexual comments (how do you explain to your 8 year old daughter what 'i'm gunna bang her' means?).  Not to mention the figurine with the broken penis (could have been funny if they didn't bring it up over & over again). Bad acting, bad language, bad content, bad script = bad review.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|never been a big comic book fan... movie made me want to read the comics!! Great movie!! Would watch again!
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|I felt that it was all the same and it got boring really quick. It would be fun for very young children.
0345529057|5.0|Watched the series on HBO, couldn't wait for the beginning of the new season so I bought the books. Books are always better than movies/series and this is NO different! Great read! From cover to cover!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think i'm addicted to this game now! It is so much fun and you are always trying to get a better score.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|This game is fun and awesome. I haven't seen a game on Kindle that has a lot of adventure to it.
B00D5YNQWM|3.0|The other reviewers were accurate. This DVD/blu ray is great for the casual fans who enjoy Aerosmith's deeper tracks. It has great visuals and great sound and Aerosmith's performance is great.<br /><br />As a huge fan I was completely disappointed that they showed only the last section of Hangman Jury. It was one of the reasons I was looking forward to this video. I love the song and was looking forward to seeing it and was extremely unhappy that they cut the first 3/4's of the song! Why did they even include it in the movie at all?<br /><br />I was also annoyed by the fact that this has the same snippy style as the You Gotta Move DVD: Every 2-3 seconds the camera angle changes and it's hard for me to pay attention to what's going on. I can't stand these concert videos that change to different cameras with every blink of the eye. I kept wanting to see more of Steven Tyler, Joe Perry, Tom Hamilton, Brad Whitford and Joey Kramer. Every time it focused on one of them, it would cut to another so fast that I couldn't focus on the cool moments these guys were giving.<br /><br />As a fan of the band members as well as their music, I enjoyed the interview parts. But the interviews were so short. I don't really understand why some people are complaining, saying that this isn't a concert DVD because of the interview segments. A large majority of Rock For The Rising Sun is the concert part. I actually would have liked more interviews. I did enjoy the behind-the-scenes segments.<br /><br />I think the song selection is great (I wish they would play some of those deeper cuts live in the US - not only Japan!). They played extremely well and I was happy with their performance. The sound quality is awesome. I would  have rated this 5 stars if only the cameras didn't switch so often, and if only they included all of Hangman Jury! The hardcore fans will be happy to see these \\"more rare\\" songs but there's nothing really exciting to see that we haven't seen before. It's Aerosmith, whois awesome, but I just wasn't blown away.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Captain America is great in this movie.  The cast is all outstanding.  It has a tremendous story that keeps you entertained.  Plus, I love the fact it is available on Amazon Prime.
B003AYMZO2|5.0|This show is as addictive as the drugs it portrays.  I can't get enough of breaking bad, every episode rocks!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Survival craft is much better than the current stage of minecraft pocket edition it would be better if there was at least an hour to play for the demo version just to get the full experience of the game.5 stars
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My daughter and I love this show!<br /><br />The characters are funny, clever, and have great chemistry with one another. I love the story-lines and the unexpected twists throughout the season.<br /><br />Personally, my favorite character is Louis! He's hilarious and so quirky, but unfortunately always seems to find a way to upset those he cares most about. I hope he finds love and much more success and respect in Season 3. I'll be rooting for him!!!
B000SEI230|4.0|I loved this book as usual.  I was a little confused by the ending.  Did she survive or pass away.  It showed that no matter what you must follow your heart .
B00BC24NT4|1.0|Having read everything Le Carre has written, I find it disgraceful that he would write such pap. It demeans his earlier work.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Thoughly enjoyed this novel.  It shows that a person can find love a second time.  You never forget your first love but you can find love in other ways.
B005MMY9A8|4.0|Great action adventure in the great tradition of Marvel comics. Traditional Norse mythology with modern special effects and a story that works.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|I really enjoyed the book as I very much enjoy the Jack Clark character. I recommend the book very highly.
1452113432|5.0|It a great cookbook I've try three of Recipes the Lavender chicken was to die for the Coq au vin chicken was great.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I mean come on, totally great book. I love Anna's character and it's nice seeing Christian fall for Anna entirely. Great series!
140053271X|5.0|It's exactly what I wanted. It's comfortable, reliable, convenient and easy to read. I don't think I will be buying any other readers in the future. This one is perfect for my needs.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I love this version of chess because you can change the difficulty level! I am just a beginner so I like to keep it easy, but my uncle is really good and he has this same app, too. I also like that you can undo moves if you haven't planned out your moves very well. Overall, I love Chess Free!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Keep with it after the first 50 pages. It's boring in the beginning but gets really good afterwards.  Still not as good as Kite Runner or A Thousand Splendid Suns but he is a great writer and this was worth my time
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved this movie! I don't follow all the comics but it's great to see so many characters together in one movie. I was a huge fan of the X-Men comics and original cartoon series but was ultimately disappointed in how they down-played so many characters in the movies. Not so here--if they can keep up this high quality there could be an endless supply of movies from this franchise.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|I'm rounding out my Pixar collection for my son.  This was offered at a cheaper price than anywhere else, and the Pixar movies look amazing on Blu Ray.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|Do you want to know what it's like to be a combat SEAL?  Watch this movie.  I'm married, 37 years, to a former SEAL (they are never ex-SEALs) and he and every SEAL I've talked to about this movie says it's the real deal.  I enjoyed it tremendously.  Having real SEALs star in the movie was a brilliant move.  SEALs can become actors.  Actors can never become SEALs.  I saw my husband in those characters.<br /><br />Watching the interplay between team members and their activities shows how they have to become a team to succeed at the incredibly difficult tasks they are asked to accomplish.  Plus the movie shows the toll it takes on their families.  It highlights how incredibly physically and mentally tough they have to be, how strong the ties between them are, even their willingness to sacrifice themselves for their teammates.  SEALs never quit.  Never.  They will never let each other down.  Never.  If they say so, they will be there.  Always.  That's their brotherhood.<br /><br />Some critics complain about the poor plot or the action jumping around the globe.  I had no problems following the plot or the action.  It was self-explanitory if you paid attention.  It also showed many of the different venues SEALs are trained for.  The action sequences were excellent and didn't dwell on slow-motion, gratuitous violence.  Yes, people were killed, this is a movie about a 'war' on terrorism.<br /><br />Some critics complained about the one-shot one-kill.  This is how SEALs are trained.  It's accurate.  They are very good at what they do.  Would you trust your back to someone who \\"might\\" be able to make the shot?<br /><br />Some critics pan the movie because of bad acting.  This is how SEALs act on missions, how they speak.  If you want to know how SEALS are made (yes, they are made) and what they do read 'Damn Few' by Rorke Denver.  He was one of the stars of 'Act of Valor' and a very experienced SEAL.<br /><br />This movie is closely based on actual events.  Sit back and enjoy watching someone else do the hard work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I so enjoyed the short season 3, and the tragedies were totally unexpected, quite the ccon drum, well written, acting and look forward to see what will transpire next season
B000L53D4O|4.0|Rolls a little too fast on tile for new walkers and it gets away from her but she can control it without any problems on carpet.  She was 10 months when i bought it and is 1 week away from turning one and walks without it now but she still likes to push it around.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the acting, the plot, the scenery, the writing.  Maggie Smith is my favorite actor, she is a breath of fresh air.  This show is the BEST!
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Oblivion is a great film for science fiction aficionados, and it certainly doesn't fail to deliver a captivating world with unique and well developed characters -- most of the characters are well developed that is, though some definitely fall short. With a beautiful soundtrack to match -- which at times can get a little overpowering -- this is an all around great movie. It's not perfect, there are a few plot-holes at times. However, my problem with this movie was that the trailer revealed way too much information. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say this:<br /><br />I understand Morgan Freeman can be a huge selling point to a movie, but revealing his character took a level of surprise completely out of the movie, and actually ended up making the movie's general plot far too predictable. The movie tries to evoke a sense of mystery and intrigue for the first beginning portion. However, having seen the trailer, and being able to piece one and two together, your best educated guess about what's going to happen in the movie is most likely correct. It's a shame, I usually love piecing things together as I watch a movie, but they definitely should have held back more in the trailer.<br /><br />As a side note, Morgan Freeman's role could have literally been played by anyone and it wouldn't have made a difference. Morgan Freeman is a badass actor, but he really didn't need to be in this movie.
B00DURILJ2|4.0|The movie is fine.. But, once again... just towards the end of the movie.. the movie freezes and we have to start the whole thing again.  This doesn't happen with NetFlix so I know it is not our setup.  And now Amazon wants you to buy movies from them instead of rent them.  Guess we'll go back to the old way and just wait till they go on sale at Costco and buy our own.  I'd rather have my video library in my home, not in Amazon's cloud.
B008VBYN80|1.0|there really isn't any way to play this game without making in app purchases, and it seems like it would require a lot of them. I quit the game when I hit the wall and could not go any further with out making a real money purchase.
0345803507|4.0|This book is much better than the previous one's.  Much better written, it does hold your interest for the most part.  Not as much repetition as the first.
B003O86FMW|5.0|IT WAS PERFECT! This book kept me on the edge of my seat. There were so many unexpected twists! Thank you Susan Collins!
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey Stirling creates an amazing fusion of violin and electronica in this tremendously innovative collection of original music. Themes range from deep to cheerful to mysterious, but always in an uplifting manner. I can't help but feel a little better about the world after listening to her music. It's worth focusing on but also delightful for simply playing in the background.<br />For what it's worth, it is also definitely worth checking out her music videos and some of her other work, much of which consists of covers of music like themes to movies and video games. This gives you a chance to see her choreography -- she is able to dance and play a violin simultaneously like I do not believe I have ever seen before. If you've read this far, take a quick peek around the internet and see if you can turn up the videos for Crystallize and Shadows. Listen, watch, and be ready to buy. This is an artist who deserves your attention.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Great movies, but films 1(ROCKY) and 6 (ROCKY BALBOA) doesn't have Portuguese (Brazilian) subtitles. Other than that, great movies. Love it!
B008XCJ03K|5.0|I immediately identified him with the stylings of great songwriters like David Gray and Paul Simon. His lyrics cut to the heart but the music and melodies are simple yet catchy. I've listened to the album maybe 30 times so far and will many more. It's one of those albums that immediately goes into constant rotation. I recommend it to anyone looking for music that makes you long for something.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|This is a die hard movie, you know how far fetched it can be. But if you are a fan of the genre, just have fun watching it. Price was right for Blu-ray.
140006922X|1.0|This book contains an opinion about Jesus based on the koran.  It is not a history of anything but a great example of how islam distorts Jesus.<br /><br />Arabic for Jesus is Yeshua (my spelling might be incorrect) but the Isa of the koran is something Mohammed made up to try to convert Christians at his time.<br /><br />The koran didn't even get the historical time period for Jesus' mother correct and that is only one error among so many other errors.<br /><br />Sorry but an opinion about Jesus is not even on the same level of history.  We live in a country where anyone can write anything but we should also know when someone is trying to denigrate another's religion (Christianity) to glorify their own religion (islam).  Unlike in many moslem controlled countries where believers of other religions cannot even carry a Bible in public, or even hint that they believe in something else other than islam, this book is allowed in our country no matter how false or denigrating it is.  We allow the koran that denigrates other's religions while spouting verse/s that say it is tolerant, those verses were abrogated by the intolerant verses.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is great I play it every day. It is very fun and easy.  I enjoy it alot and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun addictive game and time flies when you get to become a MINION and work for your leader Gru
0316776963|4.0|Another reviewer said it was laugh out loud at the airport, but I only got a couple good chuckles.  One had to be old enough to have memories of days of old, like the 60s.  Easy to read and fun.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|After losing several loved ones all st once in the past year, I feel I can relate to the message of how those left behind are affected. It is also eye opening to have an insight yo cancer and the mind of someone affected by it. This book is a total cry fest creator but is worth each and every tear shed at the truth gained from learning about the dying and those already gone. Thank you John Green for helping me to understand that a death doesn't mean that they were never here.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Great movie must watch,extremely funny,great story line and beautifully created masterpiece of a movie! Really everyone must watch this one!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If you need a small challenge his is the game for you. It's not super hard but not easy. I enjoy it a lot.
B0067R0APK|1.0|bad layout, lot of screen occupied with non essential info,  you cannot customize layout and too many unneeded permissions, accuracy so so even current temperature often incorrect
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is great u should buy it its worth$0.99 and its really fun to play with i really enjoy it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I feel that it is a well rounded show and we just love it :D I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys sitting down to a real show.
B008Y7N7JW|2.0|This movie caught a lot of hype and I expected more from it.  The story line ended up being full of holes and the finish was anticlimactic.  There are a lot better ways to spend a couple of hours of your life.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Overall exciting and fast paced.  May not be suitable for young children due to violence, however, good for adult entertainment.  Compares closely to Iron Man, Thor, etc.
B003XMAD3G|5.0|I had a problem with the motherboard when I tried to upgrade from 2GB to 4 GB of RAM.  Found out it was the wrong frequency so I asked Amazon to find me what I needed.  They did, I ordered it and it works.  What else can you say.
B004J2TPSI|3.0|It serves its purpose but lacks the functionality I desire. The biggest benefit is its universality - it can be used on any device with a headset jack. Other Bluetooth adapters allow the controlling of the phone/ipod etc. from the Bluetooth headset, this doesn't. This just allows you listen to the device in the same fashion as a traditional headset except it is wireless. You can't pause, skip tracks, or control the volume from the headset- which are the functions that many Bluetooth headsets offer. So, when I use this I have to do the aforementioned functions on the device, which for me defeats some of the convenience of wireless listening. You can mute the music from the Bluetooth headset, but the music on the device keeps playing, you just don't hear it through the headsets. The sound also gets distorted. I have to turn the volume up high on the device and then adjust the volume in the earphones, whereas other adapters sync the two devices and you can control the volume of the device through the headset. I keep it because I can use it on anything and that functionality comes in handy.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Really enjoy playing this game.  It can be challenging or relaxing, depending on which mode you choose.  It is a fun game for all.
B009AMANBA|5.0|This is the obvious movie to watch after reading the book Love is Eternal by Irving Stone. The author tells the story of Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln's lives beginning with Mary Todd's life as the daughter of a politician.  Although the book is not a biography of Abraham Lincoln, rather a historical novel, the development of his legal practice to becoming the president of the U.S. with Mary at his side, it is most complete.  Then to see the movie which highlights the end of his life, the viewer is given specifics about what the president goes through leading up to his assisination.<br />I also recommend reading Killing Lincoln by Bill O'Reilly for specific insight to President Lincoln's last days.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Fabulous read, fun, fun and enormously refreshing to read a book that I suspect was almost as much fun to read, as the author must have had writing it. It is so rear to read a book and have no clue as to the likely outcome, or turn of events. A reading memory I will treasure
B00CJGP116|3.0|As one reviewer typed Marc Anthony set the bar so high in the past with his other productions that when you compare 3.0 to others it just doesn't make it. He'll always be my favorite artist but I have to be honest.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|I needed a book that would keep me entertained and I found this one did the trick. I will not place it on a all-time favorites list but it is a good book and I'll look for more from Morton as a result of reading this one.
B00AEFXCG0|5.0|This is a film that has a Plot..<br />I gave it 5 stars because its good.<br />Nothing was disliked<br />I would recommend because its a fine movie its got a plot and lots of adventure.lots of great scenery awesome on BD.<br />So if ya like action check it out..
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Very nice read, I recommend it to anyone who liked Da Vinci Code or Angels and Demons. Same type of suspense.
B00DM11LV6|4.0|I loved this movie it moved me like no other film from Nicole Conn.  Perhaps because it is based on her true romance with Marina Rice Bader.  Perhaps I loved it because it brings hope that true love exists and can survive no matter what obsticle is put in it's way.  These small films are never perfect but this one I will buy and watch over and over again.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|The movie was entertaining, but I thought it lacked a little creativity and the acting was not as good as we'd hoped.
B008MG1E4A|2.0|Maybe I was expecting too much, but I felt this  book was lacking.  I had looked at reviews and was excited to read a first hand account of the raid.  The flow didn't seem natural, I realize he was trying to give us some idea of what the Seals go through, but I didn't really get that feel.  There was a constant use of acronyms and I hardly knew what any of them stood for.  I am sure that he originally gave the name for the acronym early, but I couldn't remember them all.  The actual raid was done ok and the activities following it were interesting.  I just did not think it was as good as advertised.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|These movies are really cool to see. The animation is great and the story line is well done. Watch it!
B00BOX0K0M|1.0|Wanted Polar Pro's Slim Frame Polarizer (Glass) and received this cheap plastic piece instead. This is a plastic cap with a thin film (aka polarizer). It reminded me of a protective shipping cap you would toss before using a device. Tested it anyways and flipping between pictures (bright sunny day) the difference is not noticeable unless you do a side by side, pick points and compare (squinting and saying, &#34;I think I see the difference&#34; is required. Video the same. This plastic filter increased the glare (yes it's shipping film was removed, which looked thicker than the polarizer film layer. GoPro's protunes seemed to have done a better job than this filter. I returned this with less than 5 minutes of use but will try the glass filter.  Glass filters tend to be better quality overall and what I thought was ordered.
B000ICZCZS|4.0|This is a very clever movie in my opinion. We watched it a while ago and both my wife and I really liked it.
B008DVJO7I|5.0|This album is a must have for any 90's rock fan. It is still one of my favorite albums. It is a solid all around album.
B003G4W49C|3.0|Well written and imaginative, but did not connect with the characters on any particular level.  Not considering continuing the journey.
0316247545|5.0|The book was full of great info on characters and quotes from the creators. I bought it for my sister, but between her birthday I got a look at the art, info, and wonderful synapses on episodes.
B0037TPMOA|5.0|Long time Stephen King fan, revisited this classic that I had last read some 25 odd years ago.  I was surprised by how my memory of the story, while retaining the highlights and themes, had lost the richness of the story telling.  So glad I made the effort to pick it up once again.  Looking forward to the sequel.
1609611543|5.0|I Loved it! I think it's an important read, not just for people trying to lose weight, but for people suffering from a whole host of other problems. It's very eye-opening. I've purchased three copies to give out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game... wish there were more levels ... a deffinate recommend .... it kept me challenged..and it was a lot of fun...
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love to play it.  It it a very active game with many different game boards to play .It to needs eye hand coordination and at times if frustrating ,but fun to play.
1582701709|2.0|Reading this book is like watching an american television show. Repeat, repeat and repeat the same thing over and over till you feel like a complete moron.<br />The two messages of this book is if you want something take ACTION which they call the secret. Another thing is be positive and believe in yourself. but it doesn't present you with how to do this so find a better book to practice these skills from fx Anthony Robbins
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|It is ok, but not to many players.  Don't like playing a game when you aare pitted against another person who you cannot see or talk to.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The page looks more like a book than the regular kindle ink.  It was easy to down load and syncs with my kindle.  That's helpful when a device needs charging in the middle of a book.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|The show captivated my attention throughout the season and the development of the characters helped the plot progress. Loved it.
0399162097|5.0|Better not to give too much aways but this is a family that shattered when a sister was taken out of the family, namely a chimp who was part of a science experiment.  Fern is gone but all feel her loss.  Rosemary, the narrator, is the our path into this wonderful family and she tells a wonderful tale.  This is a well written book that was just dreamy to read.  This is one novel that shouldn't be missed!
B00AYB12PC|4.0|As suspense flicks go, this has all the right &#34;screams&#34; covered.  I will have to watch the sequels because, one, I don't remember them that well and two, sequels are seldom as good as the original.
B00170DEM8|5.0|. Bing just makes your heart melt  New movies don't hold a candle to the pure amazing quality of these types of movies
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|A lot of flashbacks, flash forwards. Story is all over the place. It's not until the very end of the movie that you can piece the whole meaning of the story together. It's just an ok movie.
B00942S4OY|5.0|My kids love this CD...my 4 year old is even going around singing these songs now...would recommend to any teen who likes 1D!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|What can you say? If you like Bond movies, you'll like this one. It has all the things you like.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Great movie! Minions are the best part. Funnt enough to keep kids and adult interested. Interesting to go back and watch before seeing the second one.
B007HJ8C6G|2.0|This movie is more of it's time. Back when movie makers were taking the &#34;cool&#34; actors and making these weird, hip love stories.  It doesn't translate well to today's audience. Most young people would see this movie and go &#34;WTF&#34;!  Don't do it to yourself!
0688014291|4.0|At the beginning of the year, Jeff sat down with our team and challenged us to set some goals. We're not really goal setters here. We're working on it, because we see the value of it. Typically goal setting hasn't been the easiest or most intuitive thought process for our team. BUT the one goal that has been really fun for me to work on is a reading list.<br /><br />On the top of The List was The One Minute Manager by Kenneth H. Blanchard and Spencer Johnson. The book tells a story and recounts the 3 main management tips through the story. Set clear goals, praise successes, reprimand bad behavior.<br /><br />That's it. Well, there are a few more tips in how to do it in a positive way that will produce the behavior you're looking for, but it was a pretty straightforward look at how to take minimal amounts of time to create productivity and efficiency in your team. There will be a few things I definitely incorporate into my work. I agree that it is absolutely essential for your team to undersand the goal at hand, and to be set in a direction to be able to accomplish the goal.<br /><br />Secondly, the authors made a big point to look for what team members are doing right. They say to focus on and reinforce good behavior instead of bad behavior. This is something I would really like to work on within my team, and in my personal life. It sounds like a great way to work within relationships in general.<br /><br />[...]
B00A5FPQBI|4.0|A bloody story of two friends that grew up together and decided to be the kings of the drug world. This movie is very graphic. If you don't like a lot of blood and guts. Don't watch.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Makes you use your brain but not so hard to get you frustrated. Many twists in the solutions. Really enjoyed this game. Ready for the next one set of levels. Past the 20 word min and can't get this to submit.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I didn't find the charactors very believable nor the circumstances of the story.  In fact, the more I think about it, the more unbelievable everything was.  Both main characters overcome long held, deeply ingrained, anxieties almost instantly.  They both behave and act far more sophisticated and mature than any high school age kid, in my humble opinion.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show, only thing that bums me out is that I have to now wait until October 13th to see it!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good movie.  Me and my son enjoy it very much!!  I don't know why you have to write so many words, there's only so much you can say about a movie.
B001XVD21Y|4.0|If you like gory action films, this is for you.  Not exactly a theatre movie, but good for a rental.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|Loved it! Laughed so hard most of the way through! I really liked the fact that the story lines all meshed into one small world too.
0425263916|5.0|Wonderful chemistry between the main characters.  Flawed, they may be, you really root for this couple. I couldn't wait to read more in the series.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|When gaiman talks about his characters, you can't help feeling thathe knows them quite well. In this one, I felt it was a story closer to him than ever because of an acacknowledgement that he could never completely know everything that happened or why some characters did what they did.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I loved the acting! The sets, accuracy, philosophy, all of it... a little slow at times but extremely high quality in everything.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I Like this game. Graphics are beautiful. Don't like the way it wants you to buy things but I work around that. I recommend it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great characters and actors. I was hooked after the first episode. I would highly recommend. It has numerous themes and plots blending well with a feature case each episode. I'm glad season three is coming out
B00AQ2G7D6|5.0|What can I say, Its Steve McQueen, great movie, a nice nights entertainment.<br />Enjoyable for the whole family, watch and decide for yourselves.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|How is it possible to cry and laugh within the same page... the writing is absolutely amazing.<br /><br />Hazel is an amazing girl and Augustus (oh Augustus) when can I day, his character is simply amazing - You just fall in love with him ... their story is fascinating (yes very sad.. very sad..) but he has such a good look at life, and what he has and how he just makes the best of an awful situation... just love love it...
B00CSJYYO4|5.0|Una historia simplemente escrita, pero llena de esperanza, de inspiración y lindas ideas q recuerdan q la vida se debe vivir completamente, sin miedo, y disfrutando de las riquezas q ofrece. Una fantasía q me recuerda de la inocencia de la niñez y la sabiduría de la vejes. Un placer leer este libro!

B0084B5TK8|5.0|Classic literature at its' best.  A gripping tale that is timeless in its' scope.  The tale is engaging and brilliantly written.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|loved the twists and the plot - he never fails to get me in the end!! michael connelly really makes you believe you know Haller :)
B0047WJ11G|4.0|The acting is great in this movie and will have you sitting straight up in your seat. I love how I get something new out of this movie each time that watch it. It is not an easy movie to get but if you understand it and don't ask questions  if it can happen jut enjoy it.
B0094CVO2S|5.0|Hans Zimmer and James Newton Howard, (cannot forget him), put together one of the best Trilogy Scores ever!  Not only does the music embody the characters and their dark origins, it also illustrates their pain, struggles, and triumphs.  Every note is a piece of the story and this compilation of all three movies is a great tribute to the Dark Knight Trilogy. The City of Prague Philharmonic always does itself proud. I highly recommend this to anyone who loved the Dark Knight.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|it was fun in the beginning but now I cannot play anymore unless I purchase credits I thought it was free
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Amazing film. I am a doctor- this movie is spot on. I tell all my patients. The world must watch this film.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|I bought this recently, and most of the videos didn't work. This is disappointing-seeing how I was really looking forward to listening to music. This app isn't worth the cost, nor is it even worth downloading.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Even though I'm not very good at video games, this is a fun one to play.<br /><br />Ba Na Na. Banana!
B008KP6ENE|5.0|This is an awesome game. Enter a world where YOU ARE THE SHARK i mean PAPER.<br />The story is simple: You are wandering the hills when you stumble across a civilization of paper dinosaurs. They are being attacked and morphed into monsters by a bigger dinosaur, Paperys.

All this only 99&cent;!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I have a kindle fire and I have 0.7.1 and I don't know when the next version will come.One more thing WHY DO THEY HAVE REDSTONE BUT YOU CAN'T USE IT!!!!!!!!Like really?,it's CRAZY!!!
B007Z58RLC|5.0|This is a great book for self discovery and a guide to a peaceful mind. A book you can read multiple times and always learn something new.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so freaking cool. The only thing is u guys need to have something that u can look back at the instructions. I have a hard time on vector. All n all five star rating
B007TBZ63Y|3.0|Did not show plot in book<br />I like the characters<br />I like the seiries the hero's of Olympus<br />Jack kaplan
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game in one word? Easy imaginative it makes alot of sense in a way that lsd trips do the gameplay is simple but the environment always adds more fun
B003DZX3US|5.0|It is like if I bought it in the store. And I got the movie fast and easy to my home.
B000WYCF6Q|3.0|It's really small.  About 2 and a half inches all the way across, so make sure this is big enough because if you have poor eye sight it may be problematic.  Other than that it adjusts easy and can be attached anywhere, it's just a little too small.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I really enjoyed the graphics I liked that you gathered the banana's and diamonds each level was different<br />great for adults or kids
B008Y768XO|5.0|Fantastic movie. Hachi makes every emotion just pour out of your body. Great acting. Good for the whole family. Have lots of tissues available.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I'm with everybody else here. Why did you mess with the old version??!Hate the upgrade, harder to read, miss the at a glance 10-day outlook. I'm going to try weather bug. You need to fix this real fast or you will lose all your followers. Too bad. Up to now you had a pretty solid reputation going. Giving this update zero stars.<br />Oh I guess you can't write a review unless you give one star...well Amazon, maybe you should create a negative stars category!!
B00687Q0VC|5.0|Be sure to turn the volume up and the subtitles on and pay attention! It's fascinating dialogue and detail oriented. I love it! However, make sure you're awake and ready to follow along.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is super fun i cant stop playing it.The pictures,graphics ,and players are awesome.you can also play with u're friends on facebook.i recomend u buy it.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This CD is a geat mix of pop, rock and motown. A good follow-up to Shout It Out, which was more uniform pop. Overall,highly recommended!
B000JMKOI2|5.0|This is really great literature, fun to read. I enjoy his way of writing, and I think I have enjoyed it 5 times now
B000003TA4|5.0|Love this album.  Bought this one for my 10-year-old nephew and he is now a big fan.  This will be a great gift for generations to come.
B00DNLXDUW|3.0|It is okay.  Takes a bit of getting used to.  I am working my way through it.  Some of the other mobile Gmail apps are easier to use in my opinion.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Super fun read and didn't go where I thought it was going to go.  She sets it up perfectly.  The whole time I was thinking &#34;this would make a great movie&#34; and lo-and-behold, it's in development with Ben Afleck.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|Okay first of all i was drooling over this album to come out because i have heard the rumor of it for a while now,i have every single Pantera,Arson Anthem,DOWN,Superjoint Ritual,Viking Crown,Christ Inversion,Necrophagia as well as the Southern Isolation EP. What i have to say is im an Anselmo fan diehard for life ! I really dig the raw energy of this album,pure in your face no B.S attitude. No metaphors no subtle ways around it,this is against the grain metal ! Phil Anselmo you are a genius,when i am sick this is the album i put on...Bedroom Destroyer,Bedridden,Ursurpurus Bastards Rant. My favorites ! This album from start to finish is blistering loud aggressive music that goes anti-image,anti-everything. I have to say that this album is amazing from start to finish,every song just collides into the other and your left wondering damn where did the song stop and the next begin? But man lemme tell you this album is great,if you love Phil or if you love metal at all this is an album you need to own! Ill say it again YOU NEED TO OWN THIS ALBUM!!! I am fortunate enough to have been able to pick up 2 tickets to see The Illegals & Phil Anselmo on tour. My tickets are for August 14th 2013 & i am super psyched ! I have never been to a Pantera show or a Superjoint show cuz i was too young but damn it now there coming so im gonna see em. I will say i can die happy after i see Phil live.

B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Ok, well the last movie was horrible but the original three and the bonus disc are worth the price. The only change I would have made is the original making of special that was shown on tv after the movie came out (although the one included is quite informative).
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Iv always wanted a horse but my parents said it was too much work. Now whith this app (My Horse) I really can have a horse!!!
B008602KQI|4.0|Pretty much true to the book. Wish it could have been a little longer, still much left out.<br />Looking forward to the 2nd though.
1609611543|5.0|When my fasting glucose level got up to 114, I became alarmed and decided to do something about it, but what?  The title of the book got my attention since I certainly had far too much belly.  After ten months following this plan, there is mostly good news, but I cannot say that the weight has miraculously dropped off as others have indicated.  Yes, I have lost 25 pounds and have gone from size 38 pants to 36.  I look better and feel better.  However, I was expecting a more significant weight loss, but I guess I need to be patient.  Good news:  my glucose level dropped to 99 after six months.  While my doctor was pleased, I think lower would be better.  I am due for another blood test in Sept. and will see then where I am at.  Meanwhile, I continue to follow the program and I have eliminated all gluten from my diet with the exception that I have had Einkorn pasta a few times, but Dr. Davis points out that this pasta is okay.  People have asked me how I lost the weight and when I've told them, they have invariably said, \\"oh I couldn't do that.  I would miss the bread too much.\\"  I thought that too before I began eliminating wheat and after a few days, I never missed it.  I have since eliminated or cut back on other grains as well.  I do coat chicken with a sweet white rice flour (gluten-free) and about once every couple of months, I eat sushi.  I will also eat some fresh corn on the cob a couple of times next month, but otherwise, no grains.  Dr. Mercola's program makes sense, but I can't quite bring myself to give up coffee.  I will write an addendum to this in Sept. after I see my next blood test results.  Meanwhile, I am more healthy today than I was years ago and I look better.  Thank you, Dr. Davis.
B000U6BT40|5.0|Started watching after season 3.  So now just watching how it all started.  Highly recommend everyone to watch this series!!!!
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|It is filmed dark, but it's a good movie.  Love the songs. They all do a decent job at singing.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is very fun and somewhat confusing it's also a brain teaser teaser yet it's very interesting but yet slightly hard
B00821OX98|4.0|I was doubtful of the make up of this storyline but with great support from the cast and the special effects dept. I am sold on this series. Enjoyable, Entertaining and very watchable.
B009WUAK2M|5.0|Good movie, nice to see the antics by the actors and showing age on different points. Bruce Willis tells Arnold you have been back a lot... funny and intense moments... Loved it.
B008BM9L72|1.0|no story to this and even the sex is uninteresting. I hoped the second book had more substance but I have given up. complete waste of money
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|The worst of the Die Hard series, I had to fight to stay awake throughout it. Not recommended at all.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|good story line with an interesting undertone. good characters with defined roles and investigation purpose wanted to read next installment
B009S1FTVW|5.0|Symphony X is one of my favorite bands, so this may not be a balanced review. This isn't my favorite album by them, but it's still very good. :)
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|very addicting!! using your brakes can help even once u have started flipping. play this on my kindle fire and love it
B001CQ67Z8|5.0|If you like epic music, you'll enjoy this album. The Immediate is one of those groups that produces really good stuff.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish there were more levels in the initial version. I can't wait to get the new ones when they come out.
B00532A8JI|5.0|Symphony X is one of my favorite bands, so this may not be a balanced review. This isn't my favorite album by them, but it's still very good. :)
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It's great being able to take my library with me. Since all my Kindle eBooks are now available on my smartphone, I can read them anytime, anywhere. I prefer the size of the Kindle Reader, but when that's not available, or it's just not convenient to carry, Kindle for Android is an awesome backup. Although the my phone's screen is smaller, text size is not an an issue since the font is adjustable.
B0022Y570K|4.0|I liked Beyond Hell / Above Heaven more, but this album is still pretty good. Volbeat has a unique sound. :)
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I grew up on this. Seeing the old episodes again really brings back the feeling of my childhood.<br />You could always count on Star Trek for some type of moral message.
B009XY97VC|5.0|I'm pretty sure I listened to this album exclusively for a month after purchasing it. If you like epic music, get this now!
B00BU3P1NW|5.0|The real Lynyrd Skynyrd. Great mastering. On my system it sounds like you're standing in front of them. I listen to it often. All my favorites are there. Freebird was the theme of my graduation so it really takes me back. Outstanding album. A must have for any Lynyrd Skynyrd fan.  How many 8 tracks of this album did I wear out???? Get the SACD if you've got a player.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|The other day I found this website were you can get this game on your kindle for free. I can get other games 2 for free.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|I rented this cause the previews looked really good.I started watching then fell asleep.Had to go out of town next day so I did not get to watch it.But I will rent again.Thank you.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game! It is super fun! Great graphics and runs very smoothly! Works great on my Kindle Fire HD!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I bough these of WhizTags website I've heard from a friend of mine that they worked well. i was skeptical because the price was so low and did expect problems, but i could not be surprised more that it all worked so well for me on my Samsung 4. I've set it up using task launcher and it was so easy to follow and get them going. if I can set these up, then anyone can, so go ahead and enjoy he benefits of NFC tags. looks like good technology and they stick well. Expect a how i use them update soon.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love the graphics and detail in this one better than 3 but I miss the dual weapon features it made each character more dignified other than mages dual wands
B008E374PO|4.0|Bought this for my daughter and she liked it very much.  I would recommend it for music in this genre,
B00AU15HPC|5.0|By far his best solo work - he seems reborn and energized on this outing.  Stands up to repeated listenings.
B004TSXUWY|4.0|But would recommend this book, I am enjoying it, love to sit out in the sun and read easily.  Looking forward to completing.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a really fun show to watch. It feels like each episode is a cliff hanger -- you can't wait for the next. For those who don't like gore or violence though, skip it.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The Kitchen House is a good book, I really enjoyed it.  I read it a couple of years ago and liked it so much I gave it to my daughter to read.  Then my book club had it last month and I had to buy it again.  I had planned to scan it, but became so interested I read the entire book again and liked it just as much as the first time.  It is a very interesting and well written book.  I am looking forward to reading more of Kathleen Grissom. I vote this a good read.
0938045768|5.0|This book is great, it takes a person on a bodyweight progression that can start with someone who is just recovered from an injury or has a moderate obesity problem up to a high degree of strength and good general fitness.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We love this game !! It's a great game to play with the kids. Can't wait for the update and more levels
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is such a great, feel-good movie. I could watch it again & again!! Family friendly & an awesome soundtrack. Even my husband says it's a great movie!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Very entertaining and the game doesn't lag. Other bingo apps have a lot of issues but I do not see that on this app. Good stuff.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|I have always had a lukewrm appreciation for Herbert Van Karajan.  At times he displayed tremendous power in his interpretations, but there were too many recordings that seemd either perfunctory or overly teutonic.  However, these recordings of the Bruckner Symphonies are some of his best in a repotoire that is his strong suit.  I can't recommend these enough.  The readings are powerful and the playing by the Berlin Philharmonic is outstanding.  Bruckner symphonies are long events that can be quickly tiresome in the worng hands, but these interpretations are captivating and authoritative.  Great recording.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Our family loves this movie. It's a family friendly \\"never give up\\" story line. There is one cuss word early in the movie but none after that.
B006YXTRHY|5.0|Was looking to watch one night out of the blue. Came across this for dirty cheap to watch and didn't even have to leave or drop off at some vending machine. I highly recommend!!
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Great album from start to finish.  Heard one of their songs from this album and decided to buy the album.  Glad I did.  They jam from start to finish.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My son loves the life likeness of the dinosaur. It's very durable and a lot larger then I was expecting.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The app is so awesome and help full to me it tells me when and where the storm or sunshine is coming I love it very much I will keep this app for ever or when this kindle is gone but I will keep it for ever.
B001HBYHFA|4.0|I have watched the entire series so seeing the movie was nice. Good charactes + lots of action! Thats all.
B00CDFWJIG|4.0|I think it could have been even better,  and I hope they continue the story line in another movie, or even continue this one.
B004EPYZUS|4.0|Arrived in great condition.  Haven't viewed it yet, so I don't know if the DVD quality is good or not.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I generally have a difficult time falling asleep at night but this App helps tremendously. It was a great find!  I love that there are no ads and that there is a timer so I can set it to play for however long I want and go to sleep.  Many great combinations of sounds and music one can choose from.  Highly recommend this App!
B007IWG3WC|4.0|Three times the jaws but not as good as jaws itself but on its own accord is a pretty good movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Good puzzles. Relaxing to play.  I would love to see a follow up to this game. It was nice to play a game like this. Not everything needs to be all about action
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great it seems like you are raising a real horse! I have multiple horses in real-life so this game is great!! I love it and so will you..
B00BOUL9DM|5.0|this is one of the most challenging picd games I have loaded and it really makes you think about the answer. the letters are also harder to identify for me. but I really like this game.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|BEST GAME EVER !!!This is my favorite game ever! I play it every night<br /><br />Great game 17 stars!!!Best game ever!!!
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Birthday gift for granddaughter's fourth celebration. She loves it and has watched it multiple times since receiving the movie. Thank you.
0345529057|5.0|It will take forever for me to read all these, but I love the paperback copies and the price was right for four volumes at once in a neat package.
B005LJKEXS|5.0|BlueRigger has made themselves a fine cable. If I were to make a comparison it would be to the generic Amazon HDMI cables I ordered some time ago with a slightly more quality feel than the others. Since it is semi-transparent you can take a look at the outer layer of the cable. It looks tightly woven with no gaps.<br /><br />So far the product works as advertised and although I have no had a chance to test it to the full USB2.0 specs it is currently serving it's purpose so it is money well spent. Great.
B00CZ1HELA|4.0|Well,maybe a finger or a stylus. A good twist on the old pipes game. Some are easy,but some are hard. Makes you try and visualize a solution before you start flipping.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Can watch it over and over again, -I'm a fan both of opera and Maggie Smith. Just wished I'd ordered the blue ray version.
B00CISAPJS|4.0|I enjoyed the movie quite a bit.  Good entertainment.  Lots of laughs.  Different from the norm. Will recommend to my friends.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|This is an outstanding series.  The special features add additional background information that make the series even more interesting.  The care that is taken to making the series accurate and authentic is very interesting.  I am looking forward to Series 4.
B008B68IUY|4.0|Note: This review is by my wife who is a big Monster High can and collector.<br /><br />This is a neat looking toy.  The attention to detail is wonderful - the gearshift is probably my favorite part.  It's designed along the same lines as the other \\"Scaris, City of Frights\\" items; the details look like scroll work, and remind me of wrought iron.  Look closely at the accessories of any of the Scaris dolls and you'll see what I mean.  My guess is that it's supposed to remind one of the Eiffel Tower!<br /><br />My biggest pet peeve with toy cars is that most of them aren't designed to work on carpet.  But this one rolls just as well over carpet as it does linoleum.  You can push it along or give it a shove, and it rolls very well.<br /><br />The car is designed to hold four Monster High Dolls - two inside, and two sitting on the back.  The seat belts can be difficult to wrangle, and the dolls' long hair gets in the way big time, but it can be done.<br /><br />The car has a working trunk or \\"boot\\" to hold the dolls' accessories.  I do not have any of the Scaris dolls out of the box, so I can't say if the little suitcases would fit (though I doubt it).  I did fit one of my other dolls' handbags in, however, and I'm sure a folded outfit or two would fit nicely.<br /><br />The toy is made of plastic, and it is very light weight.  Since the intended audience for this toy is young ladies who play with fashion dolls, it's not built to hang with the Tonka trucks in the mud.  But since I can't imagine the ghouls of Monster High would be \\"caught dead\\" off-roading, very few little girls are going to try this - if today's little girls are anything like I was, the heavy duty toys were kept far away from fashion doll territory and vice versa.<br /><br />This is certainly a toy I would have wanted as a little girl.  I think it's a nice addition to the Monster High line, and something that many little girls would enjoy playing with.
B008ALAHA4|4.0|I bought this to use with the vehicle charger cord I bought. It allows me to charge me '11 MBA in the car with it's magsafe2 port. So far it's stayed on the cord and attached to the magsafe plug without any issues.
B009PU2KIQ|5.0|I saw him play a song on Conan a few months ago, and thought he had a sound similar to Black Keys (which I really like).  I downloaded the Deluxe Version of this albumn, thinking it would be a good distraction until a new Black Keys albumn came out.  I was pleasantly surprised that each song had a different style from the last.  Some blues/rock, some almost rockabilly, some kind of R&B, some fast, others slower.  I've got it in my car's MP3 player, and listen to the albumn about once a week.  I downloaded it back in February, and I still listen once a week.  Now, I'm looking for distractions until a new Gary Clark Jr. albumn comes out.  Highly recommended (get the deluxe version for the extra songs, which I really liked).  I just read a few other reviews here, most comparing him to past music icons and how he doesn't measure up to them.  That's unfair, and total crap (yes, I realized I said he sounded similar to Black Keys, but I never expected him to exceed their greatness in any way).  Give this guy's music a chance (might take a couple of listens to fully appreciate).  It'll make you a fan on his own merits.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|So many things I now understand. Captivating writing style. No preaching. Facts and studies support the theses and let the reader reflect.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|seriously, wow. i have been reading fail after fail, anthony ryan is what an author should be. TALENTED.  buy and read you wont be sorry,
B00CWV9FQA|4.0|My son and myself both enjoyed the movie. Their storyline kept our interest and I thought the movie was well made.
B001NLKT60|5.0|Loved the book. Second book in the series, I found it exciting with every page. Looking forward to reading the last book.
B004KPX4W2|3.0|I loved this cast. They are fun to watch and have great chemistry. As usual, the story is totally unrealistic, but who cares. Prepare the popcorn and get ready to be entertained. After all, isn't that what movies are all about, to take us places that we would not normally go? Enjoy
B00007BH5C|5.0|I love the soundtrack and I relive the movie and find myself referencing parts of the book through the music. Howard Shore has performed the beauty of Tolkien.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Dustin Hoffman's direction of this wonderful cast is masterful. He allowed the natural instinct of the cast members to pour out in this real life story. It may be somewhat slow for some but sit back with a cup of tea and take in the joy. In addition, don't turn off the movie when the credits come on, you will find a lovely surprise at the end.
B009O07NMA|5.0|It has great hits that made us fall in love with this group from the first time we heard them cruising on the radio.<br />Buy this CD.  It is just plain FUN!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's a great game everyone should play I really recommend this game to the ones who loved the movie Despicable me
1452115567|5.0|I decided this and another book would make a great mother's day present, and it does. My mom came up to us all day saying, &#34;How cute!&#34; or &#34;Look at this!&#34;
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book is just worth it. The details, the in depth, but sort of a mystery is just truly amazing. I couldn't put it down until I was done.
030746363X|5.0|I have not finished this book, but Tim's writing style is so personal and easy to read.  So real!  I tried the diet and it was great.  Some of the ideas are very different but seemed to work for me.  Even though he is more of a guru for the young (I heard about him from my nephew), I'm 65 and loved it.  I read his blog for awhile and watched some You Tube videos, too.
B00C3UUZVE|1.0|My child is 2 and a half and she couldn't use it so its not a &quot;kiddy&quot; game. The game could also have more characters because if no one likes the demo who is gonna buy the full version. Am i right or what? (Lol/smh)
B005O7PXNS|5.0|I did not watch this show when it first aired, but fell in love with it after the first few episodes!!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This is a great time killer!  Also great a teaching time management only wish there were more options for help other than Facebook, but otherwise I Love it!
B003WJQ74E|5.0|'Flowers for Algernon' is a fantastic book. Diving into the struggles of the mentally challenged. How they are treated or mis-treated. How they are looked upon and how they are ignored.<br /><br />The story is about Charlie Gordon a man in his early 30s who has grown up mentally challenged. He is happy working in a bakery as a janitor. He is oblivious to how people see him or think of him, but he is happy. He wants to learn and become smarter. To learn to read. Charlie is selected for an experimental surgery and treatment that may increase his intelligence. It was successfully performed on a little white mouse, named Algernon.<br /><br />Daniel Keyes takes us into the mind of Charlie Gordon. From prior to the operation, through the rapid growth of his intelligence and beyond. Charlie struggles with rapidly out growing his 'friends' and soothe doctors treating him. The operation opens doors into his past, revealing very hard memories of how his parents and especially his mother coped with his handicap. It is sobering to see how Charlie changes as his intelligence increases. Charlie realizes something is wrong when Algernon's behavior changes. Can Charlie harness his intelligence to find a way to save himself?<br /><br />'Flowers for Algernon' is a wonderful and moving book. It makes you think about what intelligence is as well as happiness. I was very moved by this book and highly recommend it as a must read.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|i have seend better for sure but it is okay. other wise it is okay. so what up ppl. happt
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I don't personally need a lot of fancy characteristics- just something simple to use that I can set a fairly descent number of times, and feel confident that the alarm and volume will get my attention, or wake me on schedule. Again, this clock is perfect for my needs. The only improvement I would like to see is a very small hilighted clock that appears 15 minutes before the appointed time, and then, counts down from there.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is epic to the Max it kills time and is an<br />addiction the game is just so cool I would try it if I where you
B00AYHKOZU|5.0|Once again, David Bowie has struck new territory just by delivering from life experiences. While so different from his last album, he uses tried and true personnel  from his past, (producer Tony Visconti with Earl Slick, Gail Ann Dorsey, and Sterling Campbell), to add a more reflective personal notch to his repertoire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This app is better than any other minecraft  next update put more block eggspawners and zombies like ender man and ender dragons and be able to mine as dip as you want to make it quick
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Love this cd. Bought it for one song bit the whole cd is great!  Received it real fast. A must buy!
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I have no idea how to adequately describe this, but I loved it.  I recommended it to friends, some of whom asked me why I had recommended such a &#34;young adult&#34; novel.  The problem there was that they just didn't get it.<br /><br />I totally enjoyed it.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|Bought this cd for one song. The whole cd is great. A must buy!  I hate that I have to type so many words just to post a good review
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is a lyrical, beautifully written intermingling of stories primarily about Afghanis and their lives -- in, and outside of, Afghanistan.  Each story could be its own short story, but the characters are all somehow inter-related with the most common thread being Afghanistan.  And not just historical, but modern-day so that I felt I learned so much about the lives of people who live in a country about which, I think, we Americans, know very little.  We may not understand the deep humanity of a place with which we have interacted on such a negative level -- but, this book reminds us of the shared humanity of us all -- regardless of nationality or religion, we long for connectedness as Abdullah and Pari's story makes so clear.  Love is explored in so many ways -- brother and sister, parent and child, friends, strangers, and spouses.  Truly beautifully written and deeply moving.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This one moves much faster than The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo. The final scenes are a bit unrealistic but it is a fun, intense read.
B005LAIHYU|4.0|I didn't buy this for a long time. Just thought the idea of Abe Lincoln hunting Vampires was ludicrous. Boy was I wrong. I watched it last night and loved it. The movie was very well done. Not some goofy spoof like I thought it would be. The acting was good, the storyline was very good. Very entertaining and kept my interest the entire time. They made this movie believable rather than corny....
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Entire family is hooked...we can't wait until Season 4 comes out. Season 3 surpasses our expectations and is better than the first two seasons.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This series is amazing!  I loved every minute of it. I seriously can't wait till the next book comes out.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Firefly is hands down the best sci-fi show ever created. I am totally devoted to Captain Malcom Reynolds and Kaylee.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I really enjoyed this series. Excellent character interaction, good chemistry, fun plot. I thought they very accurately portrayed the aa program and took a really cool take on the sherlock holmes mythos.
B0044XV3R8|4.0|3 Disc for such a good price!! Love it!! But some cover box got ripped. Overall best price and best movie!!
B005544TRQ|5.0|It the very best show on TV...better than MAD MEN!!!<br />It should have been on prime time...ABC...NBC ...CBS.<br />I love it...viewer don't know about the show...why is that?
0062059963|5.0|This is essentially a re-telling of the princess and the pea....and it was VERY well done! I can't wait till the next book!! :D
B0060ZJ74O|4.0|Being a scientist, I like the idea of using data to help baseball.<br />Mr. Bean use math to figure our better players.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This is my kind of book.  I am looking forward to the movie in August.  So far city of ash is just as good.
B00BMUVUZG|3.0|i think this is nice book sort of like an after school special ... but I was disapointed in Grisham because  I expected a more adult book...
B00BGIC2J2|2.0|It had a lot of related situations, but not enough humor, and too much negativity. Funniest part of the whole movie was the mustache comment in the pool.
B00AEFXQ5C|5.0|I had originally watched this movie back in college, during my twenties, and thought it was dull and boring. I just didn't get it then, and so put it aside for more energetic and thrilling movies.<br /><br />Then I watched the movie more recently, in my thirties, and now can appreciate its characters and deliberately slow pace. It is a movie about aging, and therefore is supposed to be thoughtful and slow and even sometimes stale so that the viewer can age with the movie.<br /><br />I now found the characters both interesting and uniquely fleshed out and flawed, just like real people facing problems with growing old and with a restless yearn to repair certain regrets. I could enjoy this movie because I myself had grown up and experienced regret and guilt and lost dreams. These messages are perfectly conveyed throughout the movie, making it a classic that never grows old.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I think this sucks. I download. I play. Then this video I want to see is and  quote &quot;this video is not available in this country.&quot; What the heck? I live in America! How can this be not available? THIS SUCKS. Don't waste your time.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|I am too old to figure the game out.  I got frustrated.  Let a child play it.  I will save it for my grandson.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded it and it took forever to load and freezes up my kindle that I could not go home and hand to shut down my kindle
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Guess it was just not my type of movie. Not used to seeing McCaulihey(sp.???) in such a vulgar role. Was not that interesting as to a story line.  A bunch of bumping and grinding men..lots of curse words being hurled about unnecesarily.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is even better than temple run cause graphics are better and is funnier! So download it, you will LOVE IT!
B003AYMZO2|4.0|I'm not sure about which episode . I enjoyed every episode the same.I mean I really enjoy watching breaking bad.
B00DJXSKWU|5.0|This game is well thought through. You build structures like the refinery, which brings in money by gathering crystals. While some maps are rather short on resources, it generally isn't a problem. The armory allows you to upgrade your tanks. And the turret is... well... a turret. Then you build a &quot;chassis&quot; building, and a weapon building, choosing from five for each. You can actually build all five of each, and learning each's strong points will help you. Once you have a chassis and a weapon building, you can build a tank.
B002ZBPPHA|3.0|I found out about the alternate endings in the book.  And had someone filling me in during the movie.  That was the only way I could really follow it.  Read the book, helps understand what is really going on in the movie.

B0085157B8|5.0|this is a sexy movie and funny with the obnoxious owner of the park. I think this is worth renting.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|I am a life-long sci-fi fan and had heard about this show but was never able to catch it when it originally ran on Fox.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon Prime for allowing me to enjoy this show.  I am actually glad that I was not watching it when it originally ran.  If I had been waiting for a second season I would have been &#34;gorram&#34; disappointed.
B0085OEA9U|5.0|I love this movie is funny and  I already watched it twice in a week. I definitely recommend it. Anna Kendrick is hilarious.
B00DP3IGJ6|4.0|I really loved this movie. I won't bother to go over the plot again as this has been covered in many different reviews and it would spoil things anyway. But, this movie left me in tears in the end. It accomplished what only the best science fiction is able to accomplish - use the genre to get the viewer to question basic premises and assumptions about his or her own life. The beauty of science fiction is that it can use aliens and new technologies as analogy to the questions we all face today that can get pedantic or dreary if it were set in the present day. A movie like District 9, although deeply flawed, can raise questions about our basic views of how we relate to those different from us, especially when they are in our power. Oblivion raises deeper, more philosophical questions: who am I really? What makes me myself? Why am I different from anyone else? Am I doing good in the world? Am I a good person? How do I know? Do I have a soul? If I do, what is it made of? What happens when I die?  Yes, the plot incorporated elements of many different works. So do they all. We all stand on the shoulders of giants. If a reviewer says that this movie is derivative and worn, I would accuse that reviewer of simply missing the point. Don't trust every negative review you see. It reminds me of something Lex Luthor said in the original Superman movie - to paraphrase: some people can read War and Peace and think that it's just another adventure novel. Others can read the label of a bubblegum wrapper and get the meaning of life.  This movie is awesome. Just trust me on this one.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Lots of interesting and good information. He goes off on tangents quite a bit, so it's hard to refer back to some of the great insights.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My 11-year old son couldn't put this book down.  He asked me to read the series with him.  I actually love.  Quick light reading for a busy mom.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really fun and it uses characters from the first movie. The graphics aren't that bad. This game is super fun and enjoyable.

0785153942|5.0|Its an awesome companion to get a look into more of the back story that the movie (also amazing) couldn't fit in
6305428387|5.0|This must be my year to see all the old gentler time movies.  This is another one that is in my library showing the spirit of the sport.  View on.
B00CRMWMZ0|5.0|I never really listened to Daft Punk much...and that may be a the thing that helped me like this album even more. Great album with many different elements, styles, themes, etc.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Very good construction and offers greater product protection. The Kindle was very easy to put into the case and the stand works beautifully.
B00BXHE0CI|5.0|If you like music that is intense and appreciate a band that likes to use different rhythms, then you are gonna love this album by The Dillinger Escape Plan. Be ready to go wide open. You can't listen to this with the volume low. Crank it up!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Extremely well written drama involving a range of protagonists of diff walks of life period of the early Twentieth Century.

B000SEGMAU|5.0|This book helped me with my fear of dying and my understanding of God.  Well worth the read.  I would highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great read and hated that it ended. Yes, you need to start with the first book and then the 2nd before reading this one to really appreciate the storyline.  Hope there is a fourth one to come. Really good read.
0140544518|5.0|this was a great book!  my son loved it and it was funny to hear the wolf's side of the story
B007T8BYWE|4.0|I wish it was pictures of model planes instead of the tools used to make models. I liked that I didn't need to read the instructions.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I am enjoying the game finding it a little difficult but my hand eye coordination stinks. But non the less it's cute and fun.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|If your a Quentin Tarantino fan then you will love it.<br />If not then you probably would not understand.<br />Good movie
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|Rowell's story of two teenagers, forced to sit next to each other one the bus, nicely captures the intensity and innocence of first love.  .
B000HF6XV8|5.0|A great DVD.  Thanks.  I enjoy using Amazon for these products.  Got it fast and very timely.  Amazon is a favorite for us.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a good game and will be great once my son is old enough to play it. Love Minons!
B008602KQI|5.0|Lovely concept, although I am not sure if I should credit the book for coming up with it or the movie for adapting it. Totally worth watching!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria was one of the best things to come out of MTV and i'm glad the show was made available on DVD. I couldn't wait to watch the dvd when I got it and enjoyed it as much as I did when it first aired on tv. Daria's jokes and personality hold true in today's society just like it did back in the 90's.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Best book of all time if you love diary of a wimpy kid you would love this and I recommend it for everyone
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It's fantasy but its not an epic adventure, it's a fairly simply but very powerful story. It doesn't need a sequel, it's complete in and of itself.
