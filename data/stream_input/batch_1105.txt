B004EJUMT2|3.0|Mommas, I've been around for a LOOOOOOONNNNNNNNG time, so much so that I actually saw Mercyful Fate and Venom live in their heyday.  I saw this album cover (which ROCKS!!!!!! by the way) and, after reading some reviews, was intrigued enough to purchase it. Though the first three songs and the last three make the album worth purchasing, this albums leaves much to be desired.  You cannot overstate enough the importance of having a singer who sings with conviction and authority. Though the music is good (some of the songs, unbelievably, lean towards pop)the singer's unaffected and lackadaisical delivery rarely inspire the over the top emotional reaction that one expects in a truly good black metal offering. May the Diabolus be praised. These cats could really do something if they had a singer with charisma.  This is NO MERCYFYL FATE, as has been written in some of these reviews.  Blue Oyster Cult is more like it.  I promise you, you will listen to this album a few times, then forget it.  A three star review means its \\"O.K.\\", and that it is.  May Beelzebubba add to your insight.  Gently.
B00095NX9G|5.0|Rachel Brice's Serpentine DVD is outstanding. The guided practice and instruction is terrific. I wanted to take a class in person but could not find one in my area that matched my schedule. What a workout!! I AM LEARNING SO MUCH!! Great DVD!!
0743277465|5.0|I really could not put this book down when I read it. The story is inspiring and Waitzkin talks with a charismatic wisdom that is highly engaging. His advice would be useful to virtually anyone and especially those who often encounter stressful situations.    That being said, it would be much easier to understand this book if you are either a chess player or a martial artist. (Personally, I am a chess player.) Nevertheless, seasoned readers of non-fiction who are neither can get through this book easily.
0679759328|3.0|It was a bit of a disappointing read to me. Slow in places. Lacking in color. In the end I didn't feel that I really knew who Edith Hope was. Strange irony in her last name as there seemed to be very little hope in this book. Sadness prevails.
B0034G4OZE|4.0|It's Kind of a Funny Story is an uplifting tale about a teenager overwhelmed by academic and social pressures who briefly checks himself into a psychiatric hospital. The lead actor, Keir Gilchrist (Craig), nails his role as a somber and confused 16-year-old. The supporting cast is good as well, although the female love interest is a bit cardboard and the resolution clich&eacute;d. The psychiatric hospital is also much more benign than any I have encountered (See Lemas Mitchell's Amazon review for a list of reality checks). But that's not really the point; it's more of a coming-of-age story about an adolescent trying to find his place in the world. What I liked most is the film's message about the importance of kindness; Craig is truly a kind person who feels for other people, and the other patients and staff for the most part echo that kindness and caring. Another highlight is Zach Galifianakis's creative and quirky direction, especially the scenes when Craig retreats into his active fantasy world as he sings, draws, and reminisces. Overall, I would recommend this movie for a pleasant and humorous escapist jaunt.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|I've enjoyed the Moody Blues since I first heard them in the 70's.  And listening now seems even better. I'm glad Amazon.com has such depth.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I received my preorder of this DVD the other day, and I'm thoroughly delighted with it.  Having seen the original Japanese version, I was pleased to see that the localization to English was well done.  The dubbing is good, the translation natural, and the voices match to the originals quite well.  There are subtitles in a few places where necessary.  You get art cards showing the Oz avatars of the main characters, which are quite nice.  And the extras (interviews with voice artists and original commercials for the movie) are good too.  Besides being a great story in its own right, this'll be the perfect DVD for me to share with family and friends to help them understand what this crazy anime hobby of mine is all about.

055357342X|2.0|I got to half way in the third book, and just got disgusted.  Georgie has a sickness for the trashy and the bad guys just out right murdering...um I am at a lost of words.  He can't even allow an 8 year old girl to get home to her mother. Just let her get to her mother for the love of God!....Clearly he could have made more of the dire wolves and the Starks....I can see that the children of Ned Stark with their wolves could have gathered and conquered at the right time. Nope, he loves bad guys.  He allows the Lasiters to escape all horror, tradegy, and loss, but the Honorable, Loyal, he just writes his death of the righteous. I hate it, and I threw the book across the room. I won't waste the rest of my time. I hope you suffer George, like the Starks......
B002ZG980U|5.0|Yes, this film is a mind bender but you have to pay attention. One of the best movies I've seen in awhile.
0143113100|5.0|This is an incredible book - if you are interested in the develpment of the brain - some of the challenges that occur - how the brain adjusts to those challenges and how this adjustment can be enhanced - this is the book to read - and re-read - Dr. G. Guedet
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I found myself itching for every spare moment to get to read this story.  It reminds me a little of the movie \\"Logan's Run\\", yes I am not a teenager, but a middle aged Mom.  I love youth fiction when well written and Suzanne makes Katniss' character believable.  Katniss was a survivor even before she entered the Hunger Games.  She lost her childhood after her Father died, when she became the family's chief hunter gatherer.  She no longer trusts her Mother to take care of the family.  She takes on the motherly role for her little sister, protecting her at all costs, even sacrificing herself to save her.  She enters the Hunger Games in her sister's place.  The rest of the story is of the Hunger Games itself with 23 other \\"tributes\\" and their fight for survival.  The basic concept of the story is not new, and it can be brutal and violent, but it is not gratuitous.  It is told simply and without a lot of fluff.  It is suspenseful almost from the get go, keeping you reading.  It is a good story that I recommend, even to adults.  Now I am on to reading \\"Cathing Fire\\".
0812973992|5.0|This book nearly destroys one's ability to read run of the mill writing.  The writing is brilliant and lyrical.  The compelling, wonderful characters are truly amazingly drawn and the plotting is fabulous.  The ruminations of the \\"walker\\" are poetic!  This is a great read.
B003XD7ECI|5.0|The beauty in music!   Please, make the sequel... soon!    P.S. The bonus track (Set a fire) doesn 't match much with the rest of the content, so it spoils a little the brilliant atmosphere of the album.
B003L77TZI|2.0|Thought I would like this CD but Katy Perry's music all sounds the same. High pitched voice and winey. Not my sort of music.
0399536108|2.0|I received this as a gift after putting it on my wish list. I loved the title, but Chris' book failed to live up to it. I think Chris is well-intentioned and has lived what sounds to be an interesting life - but - he pretty much provides you with his rules to live by, with little means of accomplishing them (just do it). It is based on traveling and helping others. If you really are into those things (or want those out of your life) then you might find this more valuable than I did.     I have read enough self-help (if you will) books like this, and he offers little original content but repeats mantras from others (i.e. 4-hour work weeks stuff) and places it in here. I like Chris as a person, nothing against him, but this book wasn't too useful to me and was a let down.
B003MZ0I84|5.0|Love Maroon 5. All songs are great, listened over and over.
B004HWR406|1.0|Really? Why do people want to love a movie about a mean kid who hates women? yes he's smart, but he wasn't the first to come up with this idea. yes, the acting was good, but not worth all the hipe. this is much to do about nothing much. boring, over indulgent boys who didn't get enough breast feeding.
030746363X|5.0|Whether you want to change your body, or are simply interested in reading the \\"diary of a madman\\" (author's phrase), this is a great book.  Funny, smart, and full of knowledge, tips and tricks.  The information on avoiding strength and weight plateaus alone is worth the purchase price.
B003YBNREI|3.0|This CD is much better than their last offering \\"Sibling Rivalry\\" which had nothing to offer.  Of course, the best track is \\"Nobody\\", re-done but written 40 years ago, but at least there are other reasonably good songs to listen to as well.  \\"World Gone Crazy\\" is very good, but reminiscent of the modified Michael McDonald influence that began after Stampede.  There are a couple of slow songs written by Patrick Simmons that are okay, but more like his solo efforts than his early Black Water style.  In my opinion, the worst track is the opening track, Brighter Day, which sounds like something Kenny Chesney and Jimmy Buffet would write after a night of bad Tequila.  Overall, if you are a die hard Doobie Brothers fan, this should probably be added to your collection, but chances are this will not be what you pull out when you need a Doobie fix.

B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|In the interview, Hayao Miyazaki say that he had five year olds in mind when he made this. I'm MUCH older than five. I've already seen it several times (without a five year old in sight) and will likely see it more. The only thing I would have liked different is that he needed and extra 30 seconds to wrap up the ending. You have to see it more than once to understand some of the subtleties.     The English translating the Japanese is different from the English on English which you can be interesting to follow. He calls his mother Mommy in the English/English selection and \\"Lisa\\" in the Japanese/English version.    Great for kids and for adults who long ago got over the feeling that kids movies are for kids.    A cute movie which started my collection of H. Miyazaki's films. One reason his films are so good here is because Pixar has taken a special interest and did the work on the English version. Pixar is always superb. And they have made Studio Ghibli my (current) second favorite animation studio (after Pixar).
0061989142|4.0|This is a great book for young women and teens to help excentuate their style more. The color and pictures are very clear and enhanced. Lauren covers all major and some minor aspects of a typical wardrobe. The reason for the loss of one star is that I felt she should have tailored the readers attention more to the necessities, because were all not famous and can't buy everything she's listed. Other than that, amazing book, especially for the price.
B0000013GT|5.0|I'll keep it short. BUY THIS ALBUM. With 5 classic albums under their belt, OUKAST's best works, in my opinion, are  \\"ATLiens\\" and \\"Aquemini\\". They are still the Kings of Southern hip-hop in my book.

0345423496|5.0|A lot of people voted poorly on this novel. I thought it was great. I've read 2001, 2010, but skipped 2061 or whatever it is, and went straight to 3001. I like it because it's the same \\"universe\\", but a new journey. That's what a second, third, etc. novel is suppose to be, a new adventure with the people you already trust and love. Plus, you can pick up the rest of the books within 3001. Overall, pretty gooooooood stuff. I would recommend it if you like sci fi, but reasonable sci fi... you know, stories that aren't so out of this world.
0743486285|5.0|This book is the truest depiction of life on the edge ever written.  I strongly reccomend this book to anyone who is even remotely interested in what life on the edge and loosing your mind looks/feels like.  Nikki is brutally honest about just how far he sank into deprativty and self loathing.  Having suffered through drug addiction many many years ago, I find striking parallels between the life Nikki Sixx and myself.  While I never reached as low as he did, I remember the same feelings that he has expressed in the book.  A must read!
014100018X|1.0|I read this book one Christmas holiday and have rarely felt so utterly cheated out of a few hours. The priest was a cheap target (I say this as an atheist!), a straw man, and the romance empty and shallow. I kept waiting for some depth, something that would redeem the book, some kind of moral or intellectual center, perhaps, and there was none. There are loads of great books out there -- don't waste your time on this.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I have fairly low expectations around lesbian film and was more than delighted to discover a film that centers on the developing story of love between two women that was well-acted, well-written, and filmed in a beautiful way.  I was more than pleased that \\"Elena Undone\\" offers a moving and entertaining look at the story of Elena, a pastor's wife and mother and Peyton, an author.  Set in the post-Prop 8 California, this movie offers viewers a look at the complications that arise for both women as they realize they are falling in love.  For Peyton, it is taking a major risk in letting herself be vulnerable and open to love.  For Elena it is the risk of turning her whole life and that of her husband and son upside down.  Full of quirky and funny supportive characters, the film weaves both a serious tale and a humorous one in which love wins out.  Thanks to the cast and the director, Nicole Conn, for an enjoyable and well-done film!
B003EPPEP4|5.0|I begin this review of Nikki Yanofsky's second album, self-titled \\"Nikki\\" as I did my review of her first album, \\"Ella . . . Of Thee I Swing,\\" with a paragraph of instructions to you, the reader:    If you have bought \\"Nikki\\" and you do not have Nikki's first album (a combination CD and DVD album), set \\"Nikki\\" aside, buy her first album, and--well--watch the DVD from that first, then listen to \\"Nikki.\\"  Do that and you will understand the roots of this young, but already-so-experienced jazz singer.  If you are thinking of buying this album, I absolutely recommend--at the risk of sounding like Nikki Yanofsky's marketing manager--that you buy both of her albums and view and listen to them in the order that I set forth above.    Now, about \\"Nikki.\\"  I will freely admit that the jazz purist in me was ready to dislike some of this album.  Unlike her first album where, with the exception of one of the bonus studio tracks, she stuck to jazz standards and popular tunes penned over a half-century ago, Nikki ventures partially here into singing some pop tunes, most that she co-wrote.  Happily, also included are a healthy dose of more jazz standards.  Gone here, too, is the big band, replaced with various smaller instrumental groups, with and without backup singers.  About those musicians, their playing is impeccable, swinging where that is the mood called for--which, with Nikki's jazz chops, is pretty often.  Still, I miss her swinging that full big band--maybe that will return in a future album.  This is also purely a studio album.  It is mastered perfectly--but, again, while Nikki swings deliciously on some tunes in this album, I miss (and I suspect that she did, too) the electricity of her singing her heart out in front of a live audience.    I fully understand the reasoning behind how this album was put together.  Sad but true, jazz singers who sing just pure jazz may be musically true to themselves, but they usually labor as relative unknowns to all but a small cadre ofjazz aficionados.  We jazz purists may wince at a great young jazz talent such as Nikki (though she firmly contends that she is not just a jazz singer) broadening her scope to include some pop, but it may serve to bring her a wider audience, especially among her age peers, who then may discover that they actually like her jazz side--a lot--and therein some new jazz fans may be created.  Jazz critics at the time frequently growled about singers like Ella Fitzgerald, Frank Sinatra, or Sarah Vaughan \\"going commercial,\\" but a younger singer like Nikki would likely have never heard and been inspired by them had they not.    Briefly, a few highlights from this album:    Nikki brightly swings all of the jazz standards on this album.  After a somewhat \\"schmaltzy\\" syncopated introduction to Billy Strayhorn's tune written for Duke Ellington (and his long-time theme song), \\"Take the `A' Train,\\" Nikki launches into a lusciously swinging improvised solo.  Rework the intro into a swinging straight ahead arrangement and this tune would be near-perfect.    \\"You Have to Swing It (Mr. Paganini),\\" one of Ella Fitzgerald's hallmark tunes, is sung and swung here with the voice and musical maturity that removes any thoughts that Nikki is not a \\"jazz lion\\" ready to help carry jazz's torch into the future.    \\"Bienvenue Dans Ma Vie\\" is Nikki's co-written lightly swinging European-flavored jazz excursion--sung beautifully with both French and English verses.  The listener firmly can feel the influences of a Stephane Grapelli or Jean Luc-Ponty in this tune.    I will admit that \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" is not my favorite tune to hear--it has been sung far too much--often by singers who butcher it thoroughly.  When Nikki sang it on her first album, though, she sang it lovingly and emotionally as a jazz standard that was a highlight of that concert.  She reprises it here, with only piano accompaniment, still as a tender jazz ballad.  Comparing both versions, the listener realizes how muchthis singer's voice, already lovely at age 13, has matured physically in three years.      Which brings me to my last highlight:  Nikki's singing of her co-written tribute song to her idol, Ella Fitzgerald, \\"First Lady.\\"  What we only heard fleetingly in her first album comes to full flower in this tune.  Here we treated to the mournful, sorrowful, and the darker side of Nikki's singing--and what a musically captivating moment it is.  Some of Nikki's critics have opined that Nikki's young age and lack of \\"life experience\\" renders her incapable of singing ballads with the emotional maturity that those tunes require.  Well, this tune should dispel those notions.  We can only hope that Nikki's future releases will include a healthy share of jazz standard ballads.  Her rapidly growing emotional depth, combined with her ever-smoothing lovely voice would make that a real musical treat.    Finally, if there is any \\"immaturity\\" or irony in Nikki Yanofsky, it comes, not in her album, but when she lists some of the current pop stars whose works she admires.  In most cases, my response to her about those statements is this:  \\"Honey, you left them in the dust long ago--they could learn a lot from you.\\"

B00430EQK8|5.0|Of course anyone seriously interested in the Ring should get the whole of this astonishing Spanish production, but if you want to test the Wagnerian waters or are not sure if this production is for you then this disc is perfect.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Great movie but the 3d effects were not that great at times in the movie.
0451205766|4.0|I don't know how I never read \\"The Godfather\\" before. Maybe because I'd seen the movie so many times and hadn't loved other Puzo novels. But for no particular reason I picked it up last week and couldn't put it down. My reading experience was fully colored by the film - I saw the actors and heard their voices on the page - and having read the book changed my film viewing - Coppola seemed even more brilliant for distilling complexity to a few lines, a few quick edits (it also helped me understand parts of the film I had puzzled over, like the close up of Michael's hand outside the hospital). A wonderful synergy.    Fabulous: the first half or so is riveting. The characters are vivid, the plots complex, the dialog convincing, the locations rooted in the details of senses, and I will long be digesting (and writing about) Vito's philosophy of Leadership. The leisurely pace, digressions, and frequent introduction of new colorful characters reminds me of the best 19th century British novels.    Flawed: Puzo wasn't paying attention if anyone ever told him \\"show, don't tell.\\" He beats us over the head with repetitive descriptions of characters' qualities and motivations. He lacks Vito's fine appreciation of subtlety, slapping us with the obvious. Too many characters are not developed sufficiently, and then prove to be either superfluous (what's the point of the doctor and Lucy?) or too easily disposed of (were we supposed to care about Moe Green?). Meanwhile, truly major characters - the Tattaglias, Barzini, the baddies so necessary for the finale - are little more than names on the page.    In fact, the book loses much of its energy in the second half. Compare the fine vignettes of Sollozzo and Woltz near the beginning with the complete failure to make Barzini a foe worth reckoning with at the end. Where we bite our nails when Michael takes on Sollozzo, we don't break a sweat as he prepares to tie up all the loose ends; the build up to the finale lacks tension, the outcomefeels inevitable. It's like Puzo couldn't quite figure out where he was going for a long time, and when he figured it out, never went back to edit and dial up the drama.    Finally, I found most of the sex scenes uninteresting and unnecessary.     Still, I read this book with the greatest pleasure and will be recommending it to friends for a long time.
1582701709|5.0|It's intense to think how we may have to accept responsibility for our lives.  The one thing a person has complete control over is the attitude they approach life with.  There are many people who think on the bright side that there's always a silver lining in that cloud, but the people who master the SECRET don't ever think of the cloud at all!  What you think about... you bring about.  This book contained some fun stories of positive attraction and some negitive stories of how the law of attraction works with whatever you focus on... good or bad.  Worth the read!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|The best thing about this movie is the subtle but funny dialogues. For example, when Bruce Willis asked Helen Mirren \\"Aren't you bored of the retirement life?\\". She answered \\"No, I enjoyed it. I do take the odd contract on the side\\". She meant sometimes she took a contract to kill somebody! There are other dialogues that are far more tickling but I don't want to spoil the movie by revealing them here.  I prefer this kind of jokes than the in-your-face one.    There are also a lot of actions.     In short, it's hilariously entertaining and it deserves 4 stars. I own it.
0307460444|5.0|I just received this book and it is EXACTLY what I was looking for ! Lots of different style cupcakes and delicious looking recipes ! I can't wait to try them ALL !!! There is a picture for EVERY cupcake and if Martha felt you might need a extra tip on completing the cupcake, she posted a how-to picture for that special tip. There's not only standard cupcakes, but filled cupcakes, cookie cupcakes, special occasion cupcakes and many more. All different style frostings and their detailed recipes are included. I've read most of the recipes and they really are easy to follow. If you enjoy making cupcakes, you'll truly enjoy this book !

030746363X|5.0|I preordered the updated version of this book immediately after I found out it existed and I must say I'm impressed. This book is less of a book than it is an encyclopedia of ways to hack your body. Tim even writes in the introduction that you're not supposed to read the whole thing, but rather use the Contents to search for which way you want to cheat your body. I don't doubt that the results written in this book are achievable, you just have to follow everything by the letter.    For all the skeptics out there: this isn't just a \\"weight-loss 1-2-3\\". Every single method is described in great detail, with all the science behind the process, in addition to being laid out in a very simple-to-follow step-by-step manner (for all of us who really don't care for the science).    Anyone can read this and achieve (or at least *partly* achieve) anything written in this book. Understanding the science behind it doesn't matter.
B0002S947K|5.0|I actually purchased this for one particular song and found that I like every single on the CD.  This is pretty rare!

0321543726|4.0|I purchased this book as a beginner/intermediate book on C++. I have read \\"Programming with C++\\" by John R. Hubbard and it is an excellent book to read if you understand the syntax of C++ already. Without reading the previous book, I would be completely lost in regard to basic C++, if that were left to Bjarne's explanation. If you are new to programming or C++ this is definitely not the book for you, I recommend one of Brian Overland's books to start learning the basics. Then move onto Hubbard's book, then this book. Bjarne's explanations are terrible if you are a beginner programmer. Other then that it is a good book to learn basic software fundamentals such as \\"Divide and Conquer\\" and \\"Abstraction.\\" If you take one thing out of this review, know that this book is NOT for a beginner.
B0043U93OC|5.0|All of the season finales of tv shows and cable. This one gets 1st place with White  Collar running 2nd. Not gonna give you much but I can tell you. Its a shocker! I like to thank my friend for letting me know that this show is great! If you like ancient Rome, gladiators and such this it. Being a True Blood fan, Spartacus didn't leave me short  like  the season finale of True Blood's 3rd season. Which I'm leery about 4th season in June. I don't like the Tudors though the lead actor is gorgeous but I can tell you that its a never ending of good looking half naked men, pretty society women that can't keep their hands off the Gladiators even John Hannah impressed me. (I know you like to strangle him in the Mummy movies)I'm glad Peter Mensah is well know for his other movie (this is SPARTA BOOM! down the hole) and he's brilliant. I call this a \\"serious Xena/Hercules show\\" because of the creators. they out did themselves and its a treat to watch it! :)
630542845X|4.0|I saw this movie a few years ago and had to get my own copy.  It's one of those timeless stories as relevant now and most likely the future, as it was 100 years ago.  Sean Patrick Flanery did a great job in this role.  Easy to watch and touching in it's message.
B001AQTWF2|1.0|Wow... how painful is this album?  Ms. Houston it's time to grow up, shift to a new musical style and let the tragedies in your life play through.  One of my all time favorite songs was ruined on this album.  A Song for You?  How could you obliterate this song so completely?  Embrace all of the suffering, don't auto-tune the gravel away.  At mid-forties, you still have years left to find a new audience.  Look at Bonnie Raitt, Tina Turner, Lucinda Williams, KD Lang.  Don't flame out by pushing it to be something your voice isn't any more.
B001R7IH1E|5.0|This album is fantastic. Anyone who has the slightest interest in hybrid rock, hip hop, funk, and whatever else they throw in there should purchase this album. I would strongly recommend going vinyl. You will not regret it. This album has moved the Beastie Boys into the upper echelon of my favorite artists of the past 20 years along with Red Hot Chili Peppers, 311, Incubus, Sublime, Radiohead, DMB, and Nirvana.

B003Q6D1Z6|5.0|First of all, don't expect this to be a horror nor a thriller. IT'S NOT! The ad campaign for this movie was so misleading, but it's also understandable that this movie is pretty damn hard to sell without saying much of the plot. I say watch this movie expecting a kind of expected twist but at the same time very shocking. I believe this movie has one of the most moving scenes of 2010. I don't want to say which one because I'd be spoiling the movie. I LOVED IT!! and I do recommend it for everyone.
0375713751|5.0|I read this even before I had kids and it spoke to all my hopes/fears about being a high-powered working mom.  Now that I have 2 kids (the same age as in the book!) it gets better every time I read it.  It is both hilarious and sad, and any woman who has kids or thinks she will in the future should read it!

It works to get me back into swimwear for a trip in just a few short weeks.It's tough, she tells you it is, but if you keep at it you see results fast. I recommend this to all my daughters and friends. I'm 47 and I can do it. It takes time to work up into it, but it can be done.
B004KPLVW2|5.0|Such is the way of the truly good films. I remember when Tron came out, and it was royally panned by everyone - critics and audience alike - as too deep into plot and the lights were tiring to watch! Yes, the plot is a bit convoluted, but like D.W. Griffith, who showed that the audience was capable of following two and three plots within a movie (Birth of a Nation), Tron was truly one of the first steps toward combining technology and storyline that challenged not only the intelligence, but the eye's ability to absorb truly visual interpretation.The only ones who saw what was coming were the geeks and pinheads, and we bought the VHS, the Disc (yeah, the big album looking one) and for a short period of time, you could get it on DVD for 5 bucks at Blockbuster with a free popcorn, coke and a box of candy!<br /><br />We bought the DVD, and told the clerk that we would have bought this without the frilly food. The clerk shrugged and said with a smirk, \\"Really?\\"<br /><br />I'm looking forward to seeing the new version, but I'm also expecting them to do their magic on the old one, making the shiny \\"shiny\\" and images awesome! If any film deserved it, this one does.
B000003TAR|5.0|Maybe this Seattle trio didn't invent alternative rock, but they sure gave it a swift kick in the pants that some of their like-minded competitors lacked. So much so, they're identified with the style. Singer-songwriter-guitarist Kurt Cobain's slamming artistry is aesthetics-by-torment. He attaches his pain to some of the most bone-crunching rock ever made available. Dave Grohl's drumming and Steve Albini's raw production amplify the fury of the words and music. This isn't pop music per se, but it has the savvy common to some of the finest pop. \\"Heart Shaped Box\\", \\"Dumb\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" are melodic with the best of it, while the harder stuff has a spellbinding quality. Voicing such confessions as \\"distill the life that's inside of me\\" and \\"I miss the comfort of being sad\\", the songs become a debate between Kurt and life itself. The formal logic with his relationship to it is fraught with peril. It's a desperate expression from a major talent that makes this a classic.
B00001ODHL|5.0|I watched the whole Evil dead trilogy and so far this is my favorite of all 3 movies. It's funnier then the first two, plus it has more characters, more fighting scenes and cool re-made stuff, like the car that was made in a battle machine and so on. The whole movie is amazing. What made me sad is that there will be no 4th movie as far as i can tell and the movie is a little over an hour in length. This is it. A very sad thing. Bruce played really good in all the movies. And it's incredibly fun to watch the Army of Darkness. It's a really great classic movie, give it a watch!
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|The Pacific miniseries was as far as I can tell accurate. I was in the US Navy during this period but, fortunately,did not serve in this area. An exciting, sad, well produced series. Would recommend it highly to any student of history.
B003U80I5G|4.0|I've loved this production of Jane Eyre since it was first broadcast on television in 1971. However, I believe it must be difficult for a distributor to find a worthy print from which to obtain a quality digital transfer to DVD. No doubt it could not have been foreseen at the time of the original production how beloved this version would become, and therefore it was not widely or well preserved. Though far from perfect, this transfer is so superior to the scarred, chopped-up abomination I was suckered into buying the last time around that there is really no comparison. As another reviewer has stated, many scenes are dark, but not so much so for me that it impaired my ability to see the action; perhaps the difference is in what kind of TV one has. It's true also that there are a number of color shifts throughout, but the virtue of this effort is that the film itself is intact - no missing or hopelessly butchered scenes. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience of rediscovering a favorite television classic in its entirety, and was glad I took a chance on purchasing this version. Well worth the $11 I paid for it from one of the Amazon Marketplace vendors.
B004NFB4EO|5.0|I think it's a really good song. I don't really know what other people are talking about when they say it sounds like a Madonna song, but maybe it's because I've never listened to that other song.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first began watching this series it took a little effort to reconcile the science fiction with the western theme. However the character development, humor and action hooked me. Loved this series and would recommend it to anyone that likes both cutting edge science fiction and the idea that the future will not be so different for the past and present. Too bad the series was cancelled.

I may not completely agree with all of his advice, but I think most of it is helpful and he gives good examples from great (and not so great) literature to illustrate each point.  His personal story alone was a worthwhile read and motivated me to take my writing more seriously.

B0036S4CTS|5.0|This is the sort of book that spans generations as a fantastic read for anyone. It`s real and touches home on so many levels. On the surface it`s a love story but it`s also a story about life and hardship and how people grow and change throughout life. Anyone with a lost love, is confused about life, or simply loves an amazing read will enjoy this book. It is stunningly beautiful and sincere, not to mention very fun to read. You would not regret buying this book.
B003Q6D25K|4.0|I saw PA2 in the theater and was surprised how good it was -- an uncommonly effective sequel/prequel to the first PA film, which was a surprise in itself.<br /><br />What sets both films apart from so many so-called horror films today is the old-school less-is-more approach, perhaps necessitated on the first film by the shoe-string budget.<br /><br />Sound effects count for as much as visual effects, and there is barely a drop of blood to be seen anywhere.<br /><br />Instead, both films build suspense and terror the old-fashioned way -- slowly.  If you go back and watch the great horror films in cinema, you will see how carefully the terror is modulated.  The first big scares in \\"Alien\\" or \\"Psycho,\\" to name just two classics, don't appear until at least thirty minutes into the film.<br /><br />At that point, you're fully invested in the characters and the situation and wondering what will come next.<br /><br />The two PA films also rely on the static video cameras monitoring much of the paranormal activity.  This technique forces viewers to pay close attention to the screen, to see the scares, which start small and gradually ramp up.  When you hear a low-frequency rumble on the soundtrack, it's demon time... Stop shoveling popcorn in your mouth and pay closer attention!<br /><br />I have deducted a star for the lack of extras on the DVD.  There is an extended version of the film -- which I watched, but couldn't distinguish from the version I saw in the theater.  There are also a few extra \\"found scenes\\", one of which is genuinely scary and worth seeing.  But there is no director's commentary or making-of featurette, the absence of which I will ascribe more to studio greed than an adherence to the \\"found footage\\" illusion of this film and its predecessor.  (And that illusion is blown any way as soon as the lengthy technical credits roll at the end of the second film, shot on a larger budget.)<br /><br />So if you like suspenseful old-school horror films -- not the sadistic blood baths so common today -- see the first Paranormal Activity film and then the second.  You may have trouble sleeping afterwards, especially if you live in a house with a rumbling furnace!normal Activity film and then the second.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|What a good job of raising a kid, giving him direction and morals, rules and standards.  Really.  If you have a child that demonstrates any type of pathology, one that simply cannot be avoided, then at least find a way to lessen its actual degree of evil.  In this case, you either kill your own child (Dexter) or do what Dexter's father did.  His father recognized Dexter's proclivities as being inexorable and potentially dangerous to all.  So raise him up right, I say, if you are a father that is going to let your son live at all.  Do it right? How?  Dexter was going to kill people without a doubt.  That being the absolute then at least his father teaches him to kill only bad people.  Of course, already Dexter has screwed up, killing the wrong guy, and he might have done it before and will probably get it wrong again down the road, but at least he was taught well.  A few mistakes are acceptable in anyone's life's work, right?  It happens to all of us, right?  Would we rather Dexter has no direction?  Would killing randoms be OK?  No, his father saw the deal with which Dexter was faced and pointed him in the direction which was the path least offensive, more socially acceptable, though still not being so publicly, yet more acceptable than no direction, purpose or goal at all, right?  Either teach your kid to kill only bad people, since killing people was inevitable, unavoidable and absolutely going to happen, or eliminate him (Dexter) from the face of the earth.  From a father's point of view it was obviously a difficult problem to solve, but if allowing his son to live then the father might as well mold and encourage the vigilante aspect, a characteristic or tendency, a hidden wish-they (I, we, you)-could do/be that crosses the mind of almost every average person.  Throughout all literature, be it in books, movies, plays or all types of story relating media, the vigilante who would carries out the, \\"righteous kill\\", for and on behalf of society has always been lauded for having the guts to do what you and I can't.  \\"Righteous killing\\", is seen in many instances where the law seems to have failed.  It has been touted as an almost appropriate and socially acceptable way to solve a system error and is a societal problem solving method most of us accept, being just glad \\"it is over\\", the murdering SOB being finally dead, not caring who did it or how.  In the movies this kind of justice is always performed outside the law yet inside the bounds of morally correct action.  Is this not so?  To some, Dexter is the hero of an impotent system and broken society that for some reason cannot get rid of those reprobates that should be gotten rid of.  Society has unofficially made a judgment and Dexter is the executioner for the people, of the people and by the people.  Oh my gad, it is funny!  Funny or not, Dexter, the disciplined and well taught psychopath, is the Zorro we all need and secretly want around to solve certain serious problems that our established institutions cannot.  Sounds like I agree with what Dexter does, right?  I do not, of course, personally, but it makes the premise of the TV Series tenable and acceptable on top of being very, very dark hilarity at its best. We, the facile, the squeamish never want to actually see how it is done.  That is our hypocrisy.

B000RZGFZC|5.0|I think this is the last great album of thrash metal...and the finest moment of Slayer, isn't so brutal as Reign in Blood but not less intense and extremely better album that South of Heaven, considering the evolution is alright, you can't expect that a band produce over and over again the same kind of album...the artwork is great, when I was a teenager I got this t-shirt that I loved 'till it was ripped apart when I finally see Slayer alive...after that there's no more to see!
B004132HZS|4.0|I did not expect this show to honor Doyle's Holmes as much as it does but it does meet that standard. This is critical and so many remakes and sequels do not honor the original material. Yes, this is the modern-day Holmes and for any fan or reader of Doyle's you will begin seeing tidbits throughout that are Holmesian that others will miss. And these little items are jewels! The series is not perfect as sometimes being an hour seems to make it drag longer than it should. Still, we are pleased at what it does and how it goes about it.

B002SG8A56|4.0|Flight of the Conchords is one of those things most people either love or hate: it's very quirky, which leaves little room for lukewarm feelings. I can understand how the odd combination of dry humor and goofy musical numbers would be annoying, but if you've seen a couple episodes and enjoyed them I'd have to recommend the complete series. If not, then... I wouldn't!<br /><br />The CD that comes with this set contains several very funny tracks, including some live stuff that might be interesting to fans who already own the band's full length CDs. If you haven't seen the series, keep in mind this was an HBO show - there aren't all that many episodes.

I ADORED it, watched it 2 times already, and plan on watching it a lot more times.  Christina surprised me: she played the role very well and I dont know how many actresses could have played that role with all the singing there is to it. Christina was simply perfect for it. Cher is dazzling, I loved her, I wanted to hug her throughout the whole movie.  Cam Gigandet is this gorgeous, hot, great actor that I adored (although I dont realy know how I feel about the ending with him).   Well, great movie, it is really worth your money and your time!

1416511946|5.0|I enjoyed reading the Motley Crue autobiography \\"The Dirt\\" so very much that I was interested in reading the individual band members' tomes. I started with my favorite Motley Crue member, Nikki Sixx. Nikki is an extremely intelligent man and you will realize this after savoring his well-written diary entries.  He was the most forthright and generous Crue member for literal contributions in \\"The Dirt\\", so I expected nothing less from his 1987 diary. This was the year he was strung out on heroin and overdosed on two occasions. The book's artwork is sometimes hard to look at: blood-spattered and interspersed with pictures of Nikki and friends from that time period.  His diary entries are in the print of a portable typewriter.  I devoured the book during two sick days I spent at home.  The knowledge that Nikki is long-recovered and successful today makes it bearable to read the depressing status of his life while addicted to drugs.  You will read about a young rock star in a beautiful mansion who spends a lot of his time unwashed, naked, hiding in a closet which contains his drug supplies and  brandishing a gun because he thinks people are coming after him. You will also read about the effect his unstable childhood had on his adult life. As I read about Nikki's childhood, I marveled at the similarity of John Lennon's childhood. Both sensitive, creative, and cast off to be raised by other family members while the real mother establishes a household with another man.  Meanwhile, the fathers disappear also leaving these children feeling unwanted and somewhat ashamed at the different family structure compared to other kids.  As they grow older, they are driven by their art and the chips on their shoulders and get involved with drugs.  They are successful, but it doesn't necessarily make them happy because their foundation in life has affected them so much.  Both men eventually made peace with pasts, swore off drugs, became loving parents and finally reached a sound maturity.  When I got to the end of Nikki's book (when he was finally \\"clean\\"), I loved reading about all the good things that happened to him. Twenty years clean, Nikki discovered these diaries in storage and decided to share them (in his usual generous fashion) to provide an example to kids of what not to do. Hopefully, if kids or even adults thinking of dabbling with drugs read Nikki's diary it will have a sobering effect.  A portion of the proceeds from this book funds Nikki's charity \\"Children Running in the Night\\" which partners with Covenant House..

B001USHRCK|4.0|Growing up Lego's were one of my favorite toys of all time. Beyond that, they were by far the best present to get in my opinion, because after opening up presents Christmas morning, you have something you can play with right away. When I was little however, Lego's came in big tubs to create whatever you wanted, these new lego products are definitely much more detailed than that. It look's like a good sized kit, so I'm sure there's lots to build out of it past the packaged product design, it just depends on the kids imagination.  For any kid age 7-11 who likes to build things, you can't go wrong with Lego's.     \\"(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

A copy editor's manual because if the guidelines are followed it could tell the editor how to correct every imperfection, and more importantly a guide for the everyday writer because it it changed the way I write and think about writing.<br /><br />By the time I got halfway through the book not only did I feel like a new person, but every time I read something, be it from E.B. White's own magazine, The New Yorker, to a school textbook, I would think about the text and its following of the laws of writing again.<br /><br />I am so glad that I was able to learn so much about the English language in such short time, and on the way, earned a whole new respect for E.B.

B002ZG99A4|1.0|Thus movie is HORRIBLE! Almost every shot is a close up, even in parts where it doesn't make sense (such as shots showing around a location to show that the characters are in  a new country). They even do close ups on random people that don't matter! The entire movie feels extremely claustrophobic and left me begging for it to end so I could get out of the theater (personally I refuse to stop watching a movie I've paid for, no matter how bad it was). Also, the main three actors I wanted to see (Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Jett Li) were barely in it. The close ups completely ruined ANY action sequences (which were surprisingly few and far between)and the only good parts were a few cool gory parts. Overall, don't waste your money. This is worth a netflix or redbox rental at most.

B0002TKFRM|5.0|This is my foray into classical music.  I wanted to have a SACD of some classical compositions to see how I liked it.  The recording is more laid back than most music that I listen to, but I enjoyed it.  I've only listened to it a couple of times because it's a matter of having time to sit and listen to the entire disc.  I find that's better than skipping from track to track, which is easy to do.  When you sit back and hear the whole thing, you appreciate it much more and the music brings you in.      The price was right on this one, plus I recognized the compositions, so it was a no-brainer.  I would recommend to any budding audiophile who wants to check out classical and how it varies from other types of  recordings.

I just purchased the beauty and the beast blu ray diamond edition, and received it this past monday. It's amazing, beauty and the beast is (tied with the little mermaid) for my favorite disney movie. I know it word for word, every song, even the dialogue...Belle also happens to be (and always has been) my favorite disney princess. She's intelligent, and self-less when it comes to others, finds the good in others that isn't apparent to everyone else. She enjoys reading..ever since I was little my mom has told me I look exactly like Belle, and that I remind her of this beloved disney princess because I'm not the type to sit up in my tower and wait for prince charming, I'm an adventurer, a bit of a rebel, quiet and low-key. All in all...this movie is amazing, and it felt like I was little again watching it for the first time. It never fails to make me cry. Disney did a beautiful job, and i'm so glad to see it remastered
0393324818|5.0|This book talks about how a great underdog baseball franchise the \\"Oakland Athletics\\" were able to defeat large market teams such as the Yankees and Red Sox.  It exploits scouting deficiencies in baseball and walks the reader through the mind of a true baseball mastermind but also a great businessman.
B0034G4P7Q|5.0|I say this about a great movie that moved me in many ways.One of the best things that happen and I'll try not to give up the ending,is when Mark Zuckerberg comes to the realization that he lost his best friend.Jesse Eisenberg is fantastic in this film,and so is the acting from Justin Timberlake as Sean Parker.The more I watched this movie the more I could see how Aaron Sorkin (Director) did his best to capture Mark Zuckerberg unflinching moves during his decision making,it's still hard to believe that this young man is now worth over one billion dollars.This movie moved in line with what happen to Mark Zuckerberg and how he put together one of the most outreaching web site ever created in the history of the web and social networking,which actually was the coined fazed by Mark Zuckerberg,and the faze now on every web site you go on too.Believe it or not this will be a story that will be told as was the Bill gates,now Mark Zuckerberg until the next one comes along.

6305428352|5.0|This movie came on late last night and for some odd reason I decided to watch it.  I really don't like opera or classical music at all.  Nor do I like musicals.  But this movie took my breath away.  The actors are fantastic as well the story.  It's one of the best stories I have seen in a movie since like Forrest Gump, but this one is more real.  It's basically about a guy who didn't want a music teaching job, but took it in a high school.  He then fell in love with the class, etc.  The whole movie is filled with compassion, love, and pain.  I won't spoil anything else, but I highly recommend this movie to anyone.  Even if you don't like musicals, which I do not.
0307474712|5.0|I saw someone with a hardcover copy of this book on the subway and looked it up when I got home.  I was so keen to read it right away that I ordered it on Kindle for Android -- first time ever.  I absolutely loved this book!
B001UV4XFG|2.0|I don't actually like the \\"Twilight\\" series. I bought this DVD specifically to watch the RiffTrac of it ([...]), which was awesome. So as a movie I gave it 2 stars, but the actual entertainment value I got out of it would be 4 stars.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Bruce Willis is back doing what he does best: action-comedy. The movie opens with Willis getting up as the clock turns to 6:00 AM with no alarm. This quick opening scene shows us his orderly life. He rips up his retirement checks just so he can talk to a woman in Kansas City on the phone, whom he has not met, but has a fascination. Played by Marie-Louise Parker she also writes bad spy romances which Willis reads. As Willis gets up too early, his sixth sense is working, a group of men attempt to kill him. He heads to KC and kidnaps his would-be gf. As it turns out the CIA is trying to kill him for something that happened in Guatemala in 1981. The bulk of the movie is to figure out why and to stop it before they get killed.<br /><br />The dialouge has a dry wit to it. For example when Willis takes a bullet:<br /><br />Parker: \\"This is bad.\\"<br />Willis: \\"People get shot all the time.\\"<br />Parker: \\"No they don't. They normally get paper cuts.\\"<br />Malkovich: \\"I normally get shot.\\"<br /><br />The film moves at a good pace and really gets fun when Malkovich shows up. John was a former CIA operative who was given LSD everyday for 11 years. He is quirky and paranoid.<br /><br />Ernest Borgnine: Plays a CIA records keeper.<br />Karl Urban: CIA agent hunting Willis.<br />Morgan Freeman: Former CIA agent, part of Willis' group.<br />Helen Mirren: Also a former \\"wet\\" agent. Retired and complex. She enjoys baking, arranging flowers, and killing.<br />Richard Dreyfuss shows up near the end as a bad guy arms dealer.<br /><br />As in most modern action films, impossible things happen. But then that is what makes them fun to watch and we all expect it from a Willis film.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|I think the modern movies for kids are sophisticated enough to be written to hold adults interests also.  This was So boring. It was really a huge disappointment I had bought this used for a present and watched it first, now i'm not even sure I can look my sister in the eye after giving her daughter this movie. There are probably better horse moves out there.

B0042816YK|5.0|Seller promptly sent the item.  The item was in excellent condition.  I would use this seller again.  Great movie!!!!  I have watched it several times.  The book is as good as the movie.  A wonderful romance movie.
B000784WMW|3.0|I watched this again as this is one of my favorite stories. This version is the most faithful to the book but I did not like Zelah as Jane; I did not feel any chemistry between her Jane and Mr. Rochester. Maybe because I saw Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens in the Masterpiece Theater version first and their chemistry was so strong and believable (in my opinion). That version (to me) was the most entertaining of the 4 versions I have in my collection.
B000089QEN|5.0|This story was taken from a time when people knew how to write. The characters are fleshed out, the dialog is witty, and the plot twists are worth the journey. I love that there are many shades of grey. I think that enhances the storytelling immensely. I was drawn in immediately and was disappointed when it ended. Love this movie and highly recommend it. It's the best version of Vanity Fair that I've seen.
0151013837|5.0|This is a very unusual book,  I had read the unillustrated  version and   so had to have the deluxe illustrated one to bring to life the story of Pi.    This story will take you places in your mind and imagination and is a book     worth reading...
0790729377|5.0|I have seen this movie over the decades of my life as I grew from a naive and innocent teenager to a blossoming twenty something, then a mature thirtyish, the wisdom of my forties  and now an aging baby boomer.  In each part of my life I saw this movie through different eyes.  Now I have come back to it once more, with much life experience, heartache and losse and have an even deeper appreciation for this brilliant movie.    Elia Kazan manages to make the transition from the stage play that he directed to this scintillating movie version with almost all of the original cast intact.  The casting of Vivien Leigh as Blanche Dubois was the only change, due to the necessity of having a marquee name to get the movie made.  Karl Malden and Kim Hunter were Broadway stage actors and unknowns in Hollywood.  Marlon Brando had only made one previous film, \\"The Men\\", but was also still unknown to movie audiences.  Of course, all that would change after the world saw his mesmerizing, fiery, sexually raw, intense portrayal of Stanley Kowalski.  In the hands of a lesser actor, Stanley Kowalski could have come off as a two-dimensional, cardboard cartoonish caricature of a neanderthal brute.  However, in Brando's hands, he comes across as a multi-layered, complex, ambivalent, mercurial man who can change in a heartbeat from a wife-beating drunken brute to a lost, needy, vulnerable, childlike man who has a surprising tenderness at the most unexpected times.  This is the genius of Brando.  One never knows quite what to expect from one scene to the next and this adds to the already tense, tightly wound, emotionally charged atmosphere.      Vivien Leigh's Blanche Dubois is a faded southern belle, desperately clinging to a lost past, an aristocratic upbringing on the family estate Belle Rive, a life that is dead and gone forever.  Blanche has created an artificial world of fantasy and illusion to hide how lonely and desolate her reality has become.  She has never gotten over the trauma offalling in love with a young man who betrayed her love.  She turned on him cruelly and he killed himself. Blanche is still haunted by this tragedy and has never really been able to get beyond it.  She seems to be a woman incapable of coping with life's tragedies and losses, the setbacks and difficulties that one encounters along the way.  She must pretend to be that ageless southern belle, but in reality she has stooped so low as to seduce a seventeen year old student, causing her to be fired from her job as an english teacher.  After the loss of Belle Rive she took up residence at a second rate hotel and essentially prostitued herself with a long line of strange men, until finally she was asked to leave.  She has fallen a long way, but is determined to keep up the fragile facade of her past, holding a tenuous grip on reality.      Stanley is Blanche's nemesis, the one who discovers the truth about her past. It's interesting how my view of Stanley and Blanche has changed over the years.  I can now understand why Stanley unmasked Blanche and ended her chance of marrying his best friend Mitch.  After the scene in which Stanley beats Stella in a drunken tirade and causes her to run to the upstairs neighbor, but finally come back home, the next morning he overhears a conversation between Blanche and Stella. He hears Blanche describe him as \\"common\\", a \\"survivor of the stone age\\" and say that she has a plan to get them both out of there.  Once Stanley realizes that Blanche is a threat to his very survival, to his territory, his family, then there is no question that he will do whatever he must to destroy her.  The battle lines are drawn between Stanley and Blanche and Stella and her conflicting loyalties are caught right in the middle. However, as I watch this movie today, I see that it is inevitable that Blanche will lose this epic battle.  She is no match for Stanley, who is tough, uncompromising, strong, determined and outraged at this woman who he sees as a two-faced, pretentious hypocrite without a job, money and totally destitute.  I also believe that Stanley is aware enough to realize Blanche's precarious mental state.  He senses that she is on the edge, a woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  All he has to do is help it along.      I no longer see Blanche as a victim.  I feel empathy for her plight and her slow descent into madness.  It's not a pretty site.  However, I can also see that her lies, constructed out of her own necessity to keep up this sham existence, have also caused pain and hurt to others. I can understand Stanley telling his friend Mitch the truth, rather than stand by and watch him make a fool of himself. I don't believe that Mitch or anyone else can ever save Blanche from her fate.  At one point in the movie, after the birthday party for Blanche in which Mitch has failed to show up because of what Stanley told him, we see Stanley and Stella arguing heatedly.  Stella asks what will Blanche do now if Mitch won't marry her.  Stanley utters a line which seems to be a precursor of Blanche's fate.  He says - \\"Oh, her future is all mapped out for her\\". He gives her a ticket back to Oriole and Blanche is devastated and Stella is angered at this callous gesture.      When I watched this movie earlier in my life, I actually felt as someone else did here in their review. I wasn't sure if Stanley raped Blanche or not.  That scene that passed for a rape back in 1951, seems somewhat ambiguous now.  I never read the play and now I wish that I had done so a long time ago.  It would have cleared up a good deal of my confusion.  I totally understand the constraints in which the creators of this movie were working back in the days of strict censorship.  There are controversial and taboo subjects in this story and some of it had to be removed or at least watered down. I have researched the play online and know the actual story as Williams originally wrote it.  Stanley does rape Blanche in a final act of domination andcontrol.  In doing so, he pushes her over the edge and the last vestiges of her sanity are destroyed.      What I have also come to understand, is that Tennessee Williams didn't write a story about good versus evil, right versus wrong.  This is not a morality tale.  This is reality versus illusion.  Stanley represents the modern world in all its raw coarseness, survival of the fittest.  Blanche represents a bygone world, a halcyon existence that has faded into the past, a world of frivolity, elegance, gentility and grace.  She cannot adapt to this new world and retreats into a world of make-believe.  After the scene in which Mitch angrily confronts Blanche and leaves, having found out the truth for himself, we see Blanche alone in the darkened apartment. She has gotten all dressed up with a tiara and ballgown and is conversing with imaginary guests, retreating into a long ago night of partying at Belle Rive. She is once more the southern belle, humming along to imaginary music.  Her reverie is interrupted by Stanley arriving home from the hospital.  The two of them will spend the night alone there together.  The final confrontation will inevitably take place in the ugliest possible way.  Their destinies will collide one last time and, when it is over, Blanche will have gone completely out of her mind.      The original ending was changed at the insistence of the censors, but I believe that they didn't achieve what they intended. Somehow Kazan filmed the ending in such an ambiguous way with Stella running upstairs to the neighbor vowing that this time she won't ever go back. It isn't convincing, not with what we know of her relationship with Stanley.  I always felt that she never really left for good.  Now that I know the real ending, it's almost as though I knew what Tennessee Williams had in mind without ever reading the play.  The censors just succeeded in muddying everything, clouding it with doubt.  That's why the ending never really made sense to me.  I thinkthat people will come away with their own ideas about the ending.  The triumph is that this movie got made at all.  The basic story is still intact, the actors stayed faithful to their characters and Kazan's brilliant direction made it all come together in the end.      Truth has a way of coming through even when some are determined to try to cover it up.  The censors didn't really change the ending.  They didn't take away a powerful story of passion, betrayal, deceit, lust, brutal truth and a climactic battle that ended inevitably.  This movie has stood the test of time and is as powerful and unsettling and relevant today as it was sixty years ago.  Everyone owes it to themselves to watch true greatness.
B003Q6D27S|4.0|What I love about Saw is that every movie is connected. While you can still get enjoyment out of them as a stand alone, there is nothing better than having seen them all one by one and seeing the parallel between movies, characters, friends and enemies. Bell (Jigsaw) is always at the helm (dead or not) and is the glue for each movie, in this one hes finally on the peripheral as his wife moves up. I believe this is the last (but would not be surprised to see another one) but if its not you need a marathon watch of all them before this one. I liked this premise, and enjoyed seeing familiar faces as trap escapees come together to talk about their ordeals. Every movie gives better and more elaborate traps and this one does not disappoint. I loved the carnage. It seemed more innocents died here, which is kinda sad, even loving carnage I dont just want anyone and everyone to die. Still, for me, Saw never gets old. Hit or miss in the a couple middle movies, but I enjoyed this one too. While the ending wasnt as shocking, mouth dropping as the first, or second movies, it ties up loose ends and opens the door for further chapters if they want them. I think real Saw fans will enjoy.

0545123283|3.0|Light easy reading for adults.  Good teen read...except in Linger...Grace, the 17 year old girl is sleeping with her 18 year old boyfriend.  Although it doesn't go into details about the sexual relationship with her boyfriend, it still bothers me that the book is classified for teen/young adult readers and yet these two are having sex at such a young age.
B00005Y6YB|4.0|FOR THE LIFE OF ME, I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY SCENES WERE ABRUPTLY CUT FROM THIS MAGNIFICENT SERIES, THOUGHT BY MANY TO BE ONE OF THE BEST WESTERNS EVER PRODUCED.    IF YOU WERE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE STORY, YOU WOULD FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW AT TIMES BECAUSE OF THESE INAPPROPRIATE CUTS WHICH LEFT NEW VIEWERS PUZZLED BY THE SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE STORY LINE.    I CAN ONLY ASK WHO AND WHY BUTCHERED THIS WONDERFUL STORY???    WHY????    BECAUSE OF THE DISAPPOINTING CUTS I CAN ONLY GIVE 4 STARS TO A SERIES THAT DESERVES FAR MORE THAN 5.

B003PIUBZS|5.0|if you can get past the copius amounts of blood and sex, then you will find a story about a man that starts out defiant and then loses himself. I found that I indetified with spatacus, which was a surprise to me. I knew it would be bloody but I think the sex was just to much. it should have been called \\"spartacus: Blood and Sex\\".
030746363X|5.0|I recommended this book to all of my friends and family.  Not all of it is useful to everyday people, Im not taking Ice baths but Its cool that this guy tried everything under the sun.  Fun to read and will be going back to use it as a reference during different phases of losing weight and gaining muscle.
B0043EV774|3.0|3D effect was bad at times, probably because of all the fast action. 3D looks best during still and slow scenes. The movie was okay, not worth the money really.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Great music from real musicians. Rare nowadays... definitely a good buy. I even bought a copy for my friend!    BUY THIS.
1439181780|3.0|There are some things I liked in \\"The Power\\" but I really prefer \\"The Secret\\".  I'm glad I borrowed it at the library, because this book is The Secret with a few updates. And there is only Rhonda writing. She is very informal and her language is simple and easy.  I suggest that people should read her first book and then read this one.   This is the second time I read this book and what I liked about it is that she says that you have to feel love. Fill yourself up with it.  She repeats herself too much and this book could have been shorter. The first chapters are enough.
B003EV6DBM|4.0|The actors did a better job than the early reviews led me to believe. Sometimes hitting first season quality level. A couple of rough spots for the new Doctor, but not too bad. As someone else said, they did the best with the stories they were given. The overall writing was not as great as previous seasons, though it did have a few good moments. Better than expected overall.
B004ME1C70|5.0|I know the series is about Superman, and in the original Chloe Sullivan was a non-starter, but had the writers known a talent like Alison Mack, I've no doubt he would have written her in as this imaginative crew has done.  When she is there, the stories have a polish. shine and hopefulness that is missing when she's gone.  It will be fun to see how all three of these actors continue with their careers.  Justin Hartly is just superb and possibly the next Clint Eastwood - he'll shine.  Tom Wellington has grown as an actor and behind the scenes as a leader.  I hope he continues to do hero roles as it would be hard to see him betray what he's built so far.  Very much a Giant character like Rock Hudson!  Alison could go all the way and eventually be made a Dame for great works.  She's an awesome talent and just sparkles.

B003VANOFY|5.0|Ive tried the turtlebeach x31's and x41's, the creative HS-1200's, and these are by FAR the most well designed, sounding, and most comfortable wireless headset i've ever purchased.  These things are amazing, the controls are easy to get used to and they dont squish your head!The software coupled with them is simple and has everything you need to configure them which is a huge plus.  I highly recommend anyone looking for a new headset to get these before trying any others.  You won't regret it!
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|Very happy with this seller.  I saved more money ordering the blu-ray version of this dvd online than I did if I were to purchase it in the store.  Very happy and will continue to buy from this seller.
0385737955|5.0|I was hooked on this book from the beginning. From when Thomas wakes up in The Box, everyone who reads this is immediatly interested. Maybe the one thing I didn't like about it is the ending though... But there's a sequal and that makes it worth it.
0061743526|5.0|A marvellous story told from the perspective of a ten year old girl growing up in a small town in Alabama. Does any other story capture so vividly the perspective of a young child?<br /><br />The story is roughly divided into three parts. The first is about the narrator Scout (Jean Louise), her older brother, and their young friend Dill. We follow them as they explore their house, neighbourhood with assorted and eclectic neighbours, and their father Atticus. Gradually the focus shifts to the trial where their father is to be the defence attorney. This is the centerpiece of the book - with strong passages about racial prejudice and intolerance. It is blatantly obvious that their town has two levels of justice - one for the dominant white people and another for the black people. Woe to the black person who transgresses any part of this racial divide (in this case a sexual one) - for \\"justice\\" will be served.<br /><br />By taking a child's perspective the full inequality of the system is brought out. The trial also serves notice that even if a poor white man is \\"victimized\\" by this racial code the black person still has no chance. Scout, her brother Jem, and Dill sit in the segregated black area of the court. Dill's feelings during the trial are most eloquent.<br /><br />After the trial the book seems to lose momentum somewhat - the events after seem anti-climatic. The attempted murder of Scout and Jem by Ewell is somewhat contrived and mundane compared to what has taken place - so the ending is rather weak.<br /><br />Nevertheless this is still an American Classic. The childhood viewpoint makes this an ornate and delightful read.
B003AJKPL2|5.0|There are lots of fruits I don't eat out of laziness.  Cherries were one of them.  Having to carefully eat around the pit and then having to spit out the pit (gross).  And then having to dispose of gross spit covered pits in a bowl.  And then having to dispose of the pits and wash the bowl.... I'd rather just not eat cherries at all.  And for years I didn't.    But then came this cherry pitter.  I can effortlessly pit cherries without trial.  No more dealing with pits that have been in people's mouths.  Any tool that will make me eat more fruits is a good health investment.
B001O5EH4K|3.0|When it comes to re-issuing Digitally Remastered cd's, most companies (like Sire & Quest) do a poor job by simply increasing the input level to make the album sound louder, instead of taking the original master and clean up the high's and improve the over-all clairty; so that the highs may sound a little more crisper and the bass has more \\"depth\\". This album was actually re-mastered pretty well but I just can't say the same for \\"Music for the Masses\\"; the most expensive re-issue with no sonic improvement overall. On Violator and Music of the Masses, I've found that the PCM audio files found on their dvd, actually sound better than the audio files on the album; I don't know, maybe it's just me?<br /><br />So, I'm only giving this album 3 out of 5 stars because of the poor way it was put together. First off, if the record companies want to include all their B-sides or any rare remixes onto an album, you don't put them on the dvd! How's someone supposed to hear the B-sides off a dvd disc if you want to listen to them in your car's cd player?  But don't get me wrong as I find \\"Some Great Reward\\" and \\"Violator\\" to be their best 5-star efforts, yet. But unlike any of the New Order re-issues, which have no cover-art printed on any of the booklets; (not even on the front cover of the booklet)at least the artwork and write-up of making the album are all contained in the cd booklet, which was done pretty well. But if they just included all their B-sides and some additional rare remixes on the album (since they have plenty of space left on the cd), then I'd give this 5 stars, otherwise.. it's 3 stars for this 2007 re-issue.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|it is a perfect book    it makes you think about the differences in greek and roman cultures   the ending was great and it had no umm... lame parts   the last few pages actually explain the most about the two cultures with the name of the gods and goddesses and their different names   im breaking writers code with this last sentence  the lost hero is AWESOME
B000002KKK|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this album.  I'll agree with the other reviewers here when they say that this album takes a more commercial turn than their previous work, but it still retains that distinctive blues-rock ZZ Top sound.  No complaints here!    I think most people will be familiar with the popular \\"I Thank You\\", \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\\", and \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\".  Commercial or not, these are all great ZZ Top songs.    I also quite like the blues-stylings of \\"A Fool for your Stockings\\" and the catchy closing song \\"Esther Be the One\\".  \\"Manic Mechanic\\" is an interesting and distinctive song - does not follow the usual ZZ Top formula.  \\"Lowdown in the Street\\" and \\"Hi-Fi Mama\\" are a couple more fun rockers.  I like the sax work on \\"Hi-Fi Mama\\".    Overall one of ZZ's best albums.  Definitely recommended.
B000059MEK|5.0|The CD itself was in good condition, the case was a little worn but nothing terrible. The CD included the original Daft Club card and a poster/song booklet. The actual CD is great, it is my favorite Daft Punk album.

0385738757|1.0|Maze Runner contained an original idea, the maze itself. Dashner didn't develop it very far, but what he had was about enough for one book. He should have stopped there. Doing a reset in book two - we're in a trial again - was a pretty weak, repetitive start. The unwaveringly hopeful, constructive attitude of the protagonist is not only not believable but gets pretty annoying halfway through the book. The final two sets of monsters in the 'safe zone' were overdone and I bet resulted in groans from many readers. The book went from three stars to one when there was no explanation, and the story didn't end. Setting up yet another rinse and repeat for one more book is just not cutting it.    When Thomas held the gun in the Berg, shooting David and anybody else from WICKED he can find on board would have been the healthy, satisfying, believable reaction :P
0307454541|1.0|Dry Dry Dry - couldn't get past the first few pages before putting it down in disgust.  Waste of a kindle purchase.
B002EULANU|5.0|Thanks for coming back Maxwell. I love this album as it is fresh, organic and heartfelt. Real band, well produced, real feelings, totally enjoyable experience. Its been growing on me, which is a good thing. Would be great to see you live.. I live in Oz though.. Oh, well, keep making music as it nurtures me where it matters most. Beautiful album.. I love it.
B000RZOR2U|4.0|As the other 4 star review says, these have been surpassed.... well some have. But some renderings from this amazing collection from the 70's (the ones I, in high school, 1st became acquainted with Bach) are THE BEST, still. Indeed, I got this because I was looking for a recording of BWV 46 with the closing chorus, with its cascade of recorders between verses, up to tempo and not too slow. Not to mention its bass aria with trumpet obligato that rocks. This is it. But sometimes the boy sopranos and altos are not up to par with the orchestra (probably true in Bach's day). Still, that's only SOMETIMES, not always and not even most times. Like I said, the bass is superb...always. And the woodwinds sound open and full and come to the forefront like they rarely do in modern instruments.<br /><br />If you're gonna get a complete set, get this one. Then supplement it with different recordings of your faves, if you like others better.
0439023491|5.0|&lt;em>The Hunger Games&lt;/em> was such an intense experience that I was looking forward to a little break when I got to the end of it. The end did not allow for any breaks, however. The action did not stop. There was no resolution. Like a tribute in the Hunger Games, I had to keep on.  So I downloaded &lt;em>Catching Fire&lt;/em>, the second volume in the trilogy, and made my way through it in little more than a day.Hunger Games victors Katness Everdeen and Peeta Mellark showed just a little too much spirited independence to please The Capitol of Panem. The despotic government will not leave them to live in peace but devises a strategy to keep in them in check. It must if it would maintain control over the 12 Districts of its country, which occupies a place once called the United States of America. &lt;em>Catching Fire&lt;/em> probes the questions raised in the first volume: How much abuse will people take? How long will people allow themselves to be denied their freedom and their right to pursue happiness?And what happens when the people who have been under very tight control for way too long discover just how fragile is the hold of the people in charge, that the real power-brokers are their people who surrender the rights to the bullies at the top?Suzanne Collins's characters live these questions in a futuristic world as they face concerns that we all face at one point or another--coping with the past, falling in love, living with integrity, forgiving our mistakes as well as others'.I'm a big fan of S. E. Hinton, and I see both women's books dealing with the same themes though in very different settings. The teens in both writers' books must learn to trust themselves and make judgments in a world in which reasonble, reliable adult leadership is wanting.  They are books in which the main charactes come out scarred and weary, but the reader is better for it.If you pick up on &lt;em>The Hunger Games&lt;/em> trilogy, don't make plans to do anything else. You won't want to.ant to.
B003UESJH4|5.0|A terrific trio of actors do a marvellous job in bringing to the screen the story of a reluctant, stuttering King, his wife and his speech therapist mentor.<br /><br />Further to Elizabeth's remark on Wallis \\"Apparently she has certain skills, acquired at an establishment in Shanghai\\"  Edward, the abdicating King, could well have been in need of such skills since in the book \\"The Sex Life of Famous People\\" by Irving Wallace a male acquintance of the King is quoted \\"he had the smallest pecker I have ever seen\\"<br /><br />Another marvellous read on the decades feud that existed between Wallis and Elizabeth (the Queen Mother)(she blamed Wallis and Edward for sending her husband to an early grave) is the book \\"Royal Feud\\" by Michael Thornton.<br /><br />Of such sagas is history made : pity they don't slip in those kind of tit-bits in our school's history lessons.
B0037QGS0A|1.0|Is this what Julianne Moore wants to be remembered as at age 50? May her posterity be cut off. Films such as this muck aren't needed plus are downright shameful. The human race is in a hurry to hold first place than the dirtiest cesspool. May those who produce such rubbish know no further favours in receiving funding to produce such disgusting scum. Shame on the whole thing. All shameless as could be.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|SPOILERS!!!    I found A Discovery of Witches to be a fun read that was hard to put down.  Yes, some of the standard romance and SF fiction tropes were there (e.g. moody, handsome, and rich hero; heroine wasn't just any old witch but an extremely powerful one; the lover' families were at first hostile to the relationship but then won over) but there were enough new ideas here to make it well worthy reading.  The wonderfully haunted Bishop house, almost a character in its own right, was a new idea to me and very entertaining.  Also Sophie, a late-arriving character, quickly became one of my favorites.  My only complaint about the book itself stems from my own ignorance. Before reading it, I had not realized that that it is the first of an intended trilogy.  Being unaware, imagine my disappointment when I realized (around midnight! was too caught up to put it down) that it was impossible to wrap up the story in the amount of book yet unread.  However, I love book series so that isn't really an issue with me, I was just so interested in the results of the time walking adventure that my heart sank to think that the next book probably won't be out for a year or so.      MAJOR GRIPE WITH AMAZON:  Why is the Kindle version MORE than the hardback?  Unbelievable.

0765326353|4.0|My advice to anyone thinking of reading this book is this: it may be slow to start and take a while to pick a direction, but you'll like where it's going in the end so don't give up.   Anyway, for the critique. Right off i must say i was a bit disappointed in the beginning with the assassin scene that screamed rehash of Mistborn, not to mention the somewhat annoying ditherings of armies and lords fighting a pointless battle. i was also bored with the idea of impervious warriors with magical weapons that are essentially phallic symbols. But despite this, i was intrigued by Sanderson's characters, which i believe are a definite strong point of his, and continued reading. i enjoyed Shallan's hidden motives and Kaladin's hope through suffering. However, i agree with previous posts that mention the insertion of needless side characters with no real relation to the main plot. i'm hoping that since this is intended to be an extensive series that those characters with flesh out somewhat or at least prove useful down the road.   That being said, as the book progresses and the terrible reality behind the stormworld is revealed, it definitely piques the interest in a big way. The series of major twists toward the end are extremely satisfying. In all, i'm waiting for the next book with pleasure.

0763644765|5.0|My son was already familiar with some of Leslie Patricelli's books, like No No, Yes Yes and Baby Happy, Baby Sad, so he was excited to read this one. He's 18 months and approaching potty-trainable age, so we look at this book every day (sometimes more than once) and he's learning what a potty is and what it's for, and get's excited at the end when the baby in the book successfully completes potty training. He even goes and gets the potty from the bathroom and brings it out and sits on it sometimes. I really think this book has been good at introducing the potty to my son. Let's hope the rest of training goes so smoothly!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Wonderful Christmas movie.  The only problem is that I'm related to everyone in the movie! I need to see it every Christmas.  It's good the rest of the year too.

0596009208|5.0|This book is perfect if you are new to programming with java, it covers a lot of topics fairly well, at times I wish some chapters were longer, as it seems like topics are explained a bit briefly, but since it's a beginner book, this is fine. I just finished this book, and feel like I got a decent explanation of some of the more advanced topics, and I got a deeper understanding of the more basic concepts. This book is great to read when you don't have a computer around, generally when I read books I like to have a computer around to type out all examples and work on exercises, with this book you can simply read through it and get a great understanding of a large amount of topics. Finally, this book is fun and hard to put down, I would recommend this book to any Java beginner.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This is the longest book of the series, but definitely one of the best. Goodkind weaves together a story and world that is rich and inviting. The book plays like a movie in your head and you'll have a hard time putting it down.    As a side note, there are some current issues as of this review with the Kindle Edition. It lacks all paragraph/tab indentations as well as not having the Mud People's spoken words in italics as it should. I have sent this information to Amazon, and they report that the publisher is fixing these problems, and a new update version will be released as soon as possible. According to them, if you have already purchased the Kindle Edition, you will be able to download the update for free once it is released.
B0042KZJ46|2.0|I'm a *huge* Bob Marley fan and own most of his commercial recordings as well as many bootlegs.  While the playing on this album is tight, it is uninspired, sounding very much like the studio versions of the songs.  Most strangely, the last two songs on the recording are from an audience source, rather than a soundboard source.  These two are barely listenable in my opinion.
B003ZK58WM|5.0|One of the best reads.  Looking forward to the sequels.  The characters were wonderfully developed.   Everyone I know that has read this book highly recommends it.
B000E3LIO0|3.0|Tarantula is another of these '50s sci-fi B movies from the specialist Jack Arnold, where you have to look beyond what you're seeing to get the point.<br /><br />In dealing with issues of world hunger from over-population and the concerns of some people about genetically modified food, the film is surprisingly contemporary.<br />The mild mannered and well meaning Professor Deemer (Leo G. Carroll) and his colleagues mix their new formula with a radioactive isotope to increase domestic farm animals to gargantuan size. Deemer fears future generations are at risk of food shortages...he quaintly predicts that the planet will have an over-population 3.75 billion people by the year 2000!<br /><br />To demonstrate the popular 1950s fear of disaster possible from unfetted science, Deemer's colleagues in pre-narrative  inject themselves with the formula. The drug unexpectedly drives them mad and mutates their own bodies (radiation mutation is another 1950s fear) before finally killing them. A subordinate likewise condemns Professor Deemer to death and mutation by injecting him with the formula as they scuffle among caged test animals in Deemer's laboratory. To literally illustrate 1950s fear of experiments escaping containment and wreaking havoc, one experiment, an oversized tarantula, walks to freedom out a broken door as the laboratory is destroyed by the fire.<br /><br />As with most B 1950s sci-fi movies the standard of acting and character development is subordinate to the plot, so it would be unfair to comment on the acting of John Agar and Mara Corday.<br />There is no point either, in mentioning that the spider ultimate height of 100' utterly defies the square/cube principle.<br /><br />The spider meets its doom at the hands of an very young actor who went on to huge TV and movie stardom...but to say any more would create an unforgivable spoiler.<br /><br />Tarantula is a B movie,after all, where suspension of disbelief is at its greatest, and  intended as prelude to the A movie the audience actually came to see.<br />Jack Arnold's thrust about nuclear radiation and scientists loosing control of the experiments and putting humanity at risk is purely allegorical. Trantula works at the level of showing popular concerns on the day and as an example of B-moviemaking.the A movie the audience actually came to see.<br />Jack Arnold's thrust about nuclear radiation and scientists loosing control of the experiments and putting humanity at risk is purely allegorical.

0756405890|5.0|I was recommended this book by a friend with very high expectations and not only was I not disappointed, I was simply amazed. I know when I've found a truly great book when I choose to stop reading a portion and go back and re-read it again for pure pleasure. The story is simply amazing but what makes it great is that the writing is poetry. It flows smoothly and fluently throughout the whole book with a cast of lovable characters that you can't seem to let go after you've finished reading.     After reading the book three times I went into a local book store to pick up a few new reads when I regretfully learned that Patrick Rothfuss had just been there last weekend. I was initially upset until they informed me there were 2 signed copies left which made it necessary to scrap my original plans of purchasing a new book and picking up a signed copy and enjoying it all over again.     I could not recommend this book any more to any reader. Such a great book!
B001TW69J4|5.0|I have listened to this album over and over...and over and over...    Tosin's musical acumen stands in the forefront.  What distinguishes this from other CDs is the arrangements.  The first couple of listen-throughs you hear Tosin's elite technical skills.  But in each song, there is still a \\"hook\\" that grabs you.  After multiple listens, the melodies stand out.  This is just an amazing album.  As a drummer, I am amazed that Tosin programmed these drums with minimal training.  I'm even more amazed that Navene Koperweis (the live drummer) mastered the songs and his chops add to the arrangements.      Definitely my favorite album of the past few years and in my top 10 of all time.     I can't say enough.  But I guess we all just like what we like...
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I bought this product based on the reviews where people had written that it worked for the Uppa Baby Vista.  I have no idea what they are talking about ...  It doesn't stay up very well on the handle bars and it was always tilted or falling down on one side.  I gave up on it after trying it for a few weeks because my drinks were always spilling.    I did give it to my friend that owns a Bob stroller and she found it very useful.  The Bob's handle bars are flatter on top and therefore the Buggy Buddy doesn't slide down like with the Uppa Baby.      My quest for a good cup holder for the Uppa Baby lives on ...
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I quite enjoyed the film but, in part, for reasons that have to do with past and present politics.  The mysterious and powerful 'Lord Blackstone' is the leader of a secret society that has an obvious resemblance to the Masons.  Together, and through the ceremonies/rites of this society, he has a sinister plan to take over England, America and eventually the entire world.  His plan, amongst other things, involves corrupting the police and other institutions.  Blackstone will, of course, be the literal dictator--King, Emperor--of the entire Earth and will rule by fear.<br /><br />There is a fascinating political tract written by a mysterious individual supposedly named 'Nilus' and published in 1906.  The title is 'Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' [Available on Amazon].  The tract--almost certainly fraudulent--claims to be nothing less than the minutes of a French conference of Masonic Jews and details a plan to take over the World creating a one world state.  The mechanisms for doing this will include the insidious and subversive corruption of our institutions--police, courts, media, politicians.  Monetary manipulation and instability is an important part of the plan.  The terrified and demoralized masses will welcome the peace and stability that comes from the leadership of a benevolent, and all powerful, 'King' who will be chosen by a cadre of 'Wise Men.'<br /><br />The similarities to Blackstone's sinister organization are, I think, obvious and makes me suspect that the writers of 'Sherlock Holmes' are intimate with Nilus tract.  By the way, I DO NOT believe that 'Protocols' are the actual minutes of anything, let alone the minutes of a subversive Masonic organization with Jewish guidance.  On the other hand, many of its assertions and predictions are alarmingly accurate.  I don't know who actually wrote 'Protocols' but, whoever they were, they definitely wanted to get their message out to the world.
B003YDUUH8|4.0|I'm not typically that big on greatest hits packages, unless of course there is new or additional content that makes it worthwhile.  This set is a little pricey, but all the extras (unreleased concert DVD, videos, rarities, etc.) really make it a great gift for the Robbie fan!  The only unfortunate thing is that the songs themselves are edited versions.  Would loved to have gifted and \\"adult\\" version!
B003C1QIO6|3.0|I was really hoping I'd like this CD better, but I can't. It's just ok, nothing special in my book. The songs are all over the music spectrum - some sound like old 50's songs, while others are modern, poppy sounding. I think this definitely isn't his best work.
B001JNNDDI|5.0|We got such a good price on this blu-ray on Amazon, that we ended up buying rather than renting!  The movie itself is one of the quirky, funny/sad films that you can't help falling in love with.  Great cast too!  There are plenty of reviews of the actual movie itself, so I won't go there, but just mention that the blu-ray has great picture and sound quality and plenty of extras to make it a worthwhile purchase.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|\\"Sixx A.M.\\" is the sleaze metal/melodic rock band-project of Nikki Sixx (\\"Motley Crue\\") and \\"The heroin diaries soundtrack\\" is their debut album released in 2007. This studio effort was released as a musical complement to the successful autobiographical book of the same title exploring possibly the most excessive year in Nikki's life.<br /><br />Separating the album from the book, \\"...soundtrack\\" is an incredibly well arranged effort, possibly the most diverse sleaze metal album ever, and I have to admit I did not expect it to be quite at that level of accomplishment. The songwriting features everything from orchestral arrangements, acoustic instruments all complementary to the \\"Sixx A.M.\\" rock band. The line up features James Michael on lead vocals, keyboards and guitar, DJ Ashba on lead guitar and naturally Nikki on bass and backing vocals.<br /><br />Beyond the sleaze metal riffs and rhythm section, `...Soundtrack' has a surprisingly melodic orientation, with emphasis on instrumental harmonies, large choruses, and super catchy vocal melodies. One could only guess that the melodic side of the album is due to the contribution of James Michael being the lead singer and co-songwriter along with Nikki. Favorite tracks include \\"Life is beautiful\\", \\"Pray for me\\", \\"Van Nuys\\" and the beautiful instrumental \\"intermission\\".<br /><br />Overall, \\"The heroin diaries soundtrack\\" effectively pushes the boundaries of Sleaze metal and it is fitting that it is put together by the man that invented the genre in the early 80s. The musical depth of this album is such that you really do not need to have read the book to enjoy, simply if you enjoy Sleaze metal or melodic rock, this is an inescapable must.
B000065AI3|5.0|This is the awe inspiring debut album from Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and showed just how much raw talent they had, which thankfully they've been able to maintain to the present day. This album is relatively short but is perfectly formed. Songs like 'Breakdown' and 'American Girl' were destined to be instant classics and 'Fooled Again (I don't like it)' is one of my all time Petty favourites, the angst and sneering emotion in that song are just brilliant. This is an excellent place to start with Tom Petty and a superb album overall. One of those required albums for nearly all CD collections. WELL worth a buy.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Being almost 35 years old, and having missed The Beatles when they first came out, I missed out on some things.  However, one thing I remember well is listening to their original 45's handed down from family - and these were always mono.  This was the way The Beatles intended it to sound.  The Beatles themselves only personally supervised the MONO mixes of all their albums before \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\".  The stereo mixes were just there, frankly, to satisfy audio snobs who, at the time, refused to listen to anything that wasn't stereo.  However, when The Beatles themselves would hold a listening party for one of their new albums, they always presented the mono version, because you couldn't hear the whole sonic picture of the song unless you stood directly in the middle of the two speakers.  Needless to say, very few people can stand in such a position at the same time.  There was one story of Paul playing a stereo version of a certain album for a friend, and they had to keep walking back and forth between the left and right speakers to hear either Ringo's drums, George's guitar, and so on.  This wasn't the case with the standard mono 45's and mono LP's.  I remember the crisp, exciting sound of these records, replete with hisses, pops, and scratches.  When I got older I, of course, still loved The Fab Four and bought all of their releases in various formats...well, all of the formats to be precise (including 8track).  I must say, and I am in no way being a revisionist, I always thought that many of their recordings in stereo sounded awkward.  The panning was too much!  George's guitar on the right, Paul's bass on the left, even the harmonies were panned in some recordings.  I tried various things, like sitting directly in the middle of my speakers trying to feel the full effect of the recordings.  I was always very 'aware' of the separation left to right.  Well, as I sit here now blissfully listening to \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" from \\"Sergent Pepper\\" in mono, Ifeel my life as a Beatles fan is now complete.<br />  This is how I always dreamed I could listen to my favorite four British Blokes.  I'm not kidding, I remember clearly driving down the road at age 16, listening to the blue compilation on cassette, cringing at the separation and wishing that they would release a better mix someday.  Now I have it!  These selected albums re-released in glorious mono is a godsend to a Beatles nut like me.  I haven't listened to every cd from the set yet, but I'm closing in.  The ones I have listened to, \\"Beatles For Sale\\", \\"Hard Days Night\\", \\"Help\\", \\"Rubber Soul\\", \\"Revolver\\", and \\"Sergent Pepper\\" ALL sound better in mono.  Not only do we have these titles thankfully available in mono mixes, but the mastering of the sound quality is mind boggling.  The only word I can use to describe the mastering of these cd's is \\"perfect\\".  I rarely call anything perfect.<br />  I own the complete Beatles boxed set (in stereo), and the Beatles USB.  Of course I have every video they've ever made.  I now have it all.  And I must say, these mono masters are the keystone in a beautiful Beatles collection.  If you don't like The Beatles, but LOVE The Beatles - BUY THIS before it's too late.  It is, after all, a limited edition.  Now let me hear some of that rock and roll music!
B000000OPU|5.0|As other reviewers have noted 'So' is one of the best places to start with Peter Gabriels work. It has some astounding music on it. 'Red rain' is powerful and evocative, 'Don't Give Up' is plaintive and haunting, 'Sledgehammer' is pure unadulterated exuberance, 'Mercy Street' is beautifully melancholic and 'In Your Eyes' has brilliant lyrics and a great feel. The other tracks are just as good and the album sits together as a whole perfectly. It was very much of it's time and yet manages to stand up against Gabriels complete body of work, both prior and since. This is an excellent album and highly recommended for any music collection. Well worth a try.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B003TT2X72|5.0|First the quality of this Bluray is fantastic. But I feel the consumer was ripped off by all three of the Lord of the Rings Blurays.  The extended versions of the Lord of the Rings was released before the Bluray version and the bluray version should have included the extended versions of the movies.  This is another case of Hollywood taking advantage of the consumer.  I hope it bites them in the butt when they finally release the extended version on bluray.  I hope no one buys them.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|'Kinky Boots' is a great British comedy that shows home talent to superb effect. The story is both hilarious and touching by turns and will keep you watching until the end. The story is original and apparently based on true events. Some of the phrases that 'Lola' comes out with will crack you up and the northern discomfort around transvestites makes for various humorous scenes. Overall it is well acted and directed, with a good soundtrack and is one that the blokes can enjoy as much as (or at least as well as) the ladies. Worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B004MKM8L8|5.0|This is a prereview of this bluray.  The movie was great and we have the other six movies in bluray and they are very high quality and I expect nothing less for this bluray.
B002ZG980U|4.0|`Inception' is one of those films that surprises you by being a whole lot better than you anticipated. I knew the basic premise of the film from the trailer, but this had so much more going for it than I had hoped to imagine.<br /><br />This follows a team who usually enter dreams to steal information from the dreamer (extraction), but in this case go into a dream to plant information (inception). This is the basic premise, but the levels of detail and philosophy behind the idea make this something more than your run of the mill Hollywood extravaganza. I won't ruin it by going into much more detail here, suffice to say there is more to the film than just that basic idea.<br /><br />Everyone in this film is acting at the top of their game and the special effects (whilst reminiscent of `The Matrix' in places) are simply excellent. This manages to come up with quite a complex storyline, but you are never left feeling lost or unsure of where you are, apart from the deliberately ambiguous ending which leaves things open to your open interpretation after leaving the main bulk of the story tied up in a highly satisfying way.<br /><br />This managed to hold my attention for the whole duration (without my mind wandering once) and I was often on the edge of my seat or emotionally involved with the characters. Ken Watanabe is as great as we have come to expect and DiCaprio also turns out a stellar performance. At the end of the day this was an accomplished bit of film making, that delivered a suspenseful, original premise in an authentic and gripping way. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0802798225|3.0|This one was a really sweet and touching story. I was really enthralled with it. I felt immediately for Alex and Brit and how their circumstances often dictated and controlled how they perceived themselves and the world around them. It was hilarious how they would tease and ultimately just get on each others nerves when they were forced to work with one another. The dark side of Alex and his reality is something I was so glad was put in this book. There were things that were not glossed over. They were real. But the message, is what rings true for anyone. No matter who you are or where you come from don't ever let your circumstances or people in your life convince you that you do not deserve better, that you cannot be better, and that your life is worth nothing. Fear is a true prison. And fear without knowlege and wisdom and belief in yourself is a dangerous place to be.<br /><br />Brit's story rings true as well that one should never assume that just because things appear to be perfect does not mean that they are. Perfection is an illusion and that's all. We should never think that a person who is in a certain \\"class\\" does not bleed and hurt and struggle any less than the next person.<br /><br />What I did not like about this story and what left me wanting, is that Alex and Brit obviously had this undeniable passionate love for one another. And some could even argue that it may be borderline self destructive. But I did not really agree with how easy it seemed and how disconnected her parents seemed to be about Brit and her well being concerning her relationship with Alex. This part of the story I did not feel played out in a realistic way. Also she is a virgin and although their \\"interludes\\" in the past were very sensual, when she finally is with Alex for the first time, there was no passion or sensuality present. It made the whole climax of them coming together very disappointing and rushed and completely lacking. It was a real downer for me.<br /><br />I did love the epilogue though. And I would recommend this read.And I would recommend this read.
B00005ABKC|4.0|'Hard Promises' is one of Pettys most underrated albums. It is often overlooked in favour of his earlier work or his mega successful later output, but this album has it's own sound and some great tracks. 'Waiting' is one of the most well known from this album and it really is an amazing track, but tracks like 'Woman in Love (it's not me)' are just as powerful and the lyrics of this particular track are just awesome. The Stevie Nicks duet 'Insider' is a brilliant listen and sits perfectly in the middle of this album. This isn't always the first album I go to when I want a hit of Petty, but at the right time and place it is just superb to put on and soak up. Worth a listen, not essential Petty, but definitely one to add to your collection as you're finding those last gems.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0307266303|1.0|Some friends liked this, so I've tried this twice now.  Both times were abject failures.  I really can't abide this guy's writing.
B000002O1P|4.0|Originally conceived as a double album (but released as a single) 'Southern Accents' delivers another CD packed with that Heartbreaker sound and Tom Petty's unique songwriting and vocals. It is less accessible than other Petty albums but still has some tracks that stand out. 'Rebels' is especially good and although 'Don't Come Around Here No More' is one of the most well known from this CD, it's sound is the most unlike the rest of the album. 'Spike' is a light and fun track and the title track delivers some great lyrics. Overall this is a great addition to any Petty collection, especially as it is so often overlooked. There are better albums to buy if you've not tried Tom Petty before, 'Full Moon Fever', 'Wildflowers' and 'Anthology' are all good starting places, but this album has a great sound and is well worth a buy.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|If you love foreign accents, period pieces featuring a strong female character, and a brooding dark man with gorgeous blue eyes, then I suggest you buy this movie! For me, it is easily up there with Gone with the Wind. Love, love, love this!
B000C20VPA|5.0|Having not seen 'Goodfellas' to compare this to (at the point when I watched this film) I was thoroughly impressed with 'Casino'. A great deal of it is shot with De Niro doing a voice-over, telling the story as he went, which I really liked. The way a casino was run and how it all relates back to mob control was fascinating to see and the various tricks the customers and casino owners use are pretty inventive. Some parts of this film are pretty graphic, as to be expected from Scorcese, but the story overall is gripping and kept me engaged the whole time. The extras disc is excellent, with some great featurettes and bonus material to really add to your understanding of the film. This is a great gangster type movie and brilliantly directed and acted. Well worth a viewing.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|From the first page I was emotionally captivated by Grace...and continued to be with Sam and other characters in this amazing story of a life with dramaticly emotional, and at times, heart-wrenching, personal reality. What a delicious feast!!!
B001R60ESE|4.0|From a quality point of view, both video and audio are 5 stars as many have stated. As for the diverse lineup of artists, I think that pretty much depends on how eclectic your tastes are. I personally didn't have any problems with Steve Tyler and Yo Yo Ma being on the same stage. But that's just me. You would have to listen for yourself.    I had 2 issues - one of which led me to give it 4 instead of 5 stars. The performance of the Ennio Morricone piece from Cinema Paradiso is both captivating and intense. Yet in the middle of one of his solo, inexplicably Chris winks at someone in the audience. This just ruined the whole piece for me. (juxtapose this with the comment he made at the end regarding needing a drink...) This is one of my favorite all time piece but because of this, I will only listen to this piece on CD. This is a case where listening is truly better than seeing.    The other issue was with the disc itself. The initial disc I received was defective in that the \\"special feature\\" wouldn't play back properly. Amazon promptly shipped a replacement which worked fine; typical kind of A+ service from Amazon
0061801313|4.0|I am so glad that I bought the box set, as it takes me a little over a day just to read one book.  I cannot bear to put it down! I was a little disappointed that the TV show differs from the books. It just seems weird, because I keep thinking in my head \\"thats not what happened!\\". I like that the books go into more detail, because it makes it so much more interesting.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I've been waiting a long time to write to Amazon and express how strong and incredible Stripped is. I bought it on my bithday December 30th back in 2003 and it is just incredible to listen to.I love 17 out of the 20 songs.Every song is personal and about life.Christina Aguilera in my opinion has the voice of a mature woman.Her voice is strong and captivating and i just can't stop listening to this album.She's peerless.I have'nt heard any other artist her age that sounds like her. Also she sounds like a trained gymnast doing 4 to 6 backflips in a row wih her captivating voice.I believe Stripped is the best work she has successfully accomplished to date.Stripped is a transformation into adulthood.The best songs on this album to me are Stripped Intro,Fighter,Impossible,Underappreciated,Beautiful,Cruz,Soar,and Keep On Singin' My Song.Her vocal strength is astounding especially on Fighter,Soar,and Keep On Singin' My Song.I refer to her as Captivating Christina because of her striking voice.I have stripped placed first in my cd drawer set because it's my most favorite cd.I can't wait to hear her 5th studio album.Well done Christina stripped is an A+ project.I forgot to mention the song I'm OK is very emotional and healing and it can help any all people heal fom personal,emotional situations in their lives-experiences lived from in the past and continuing into the future.Stripped is a true treasure to me. Thank you so much Christina.

1449382673|5.0|Head First Python is an introduction to the Python language for programmers with a background in other languages.   By the end of the first chapter, you'll have experienced lists, functions and iteration, while moving forward at a comfortable pace.   You will not find detailed API descriptions and edge case discussions, and the book doesn't bog down in esoteric examples.    Programming \\"best practices\\" are not neglected, either.   Code re-use and modules are quickly brought into the discussion, and then on to basic exception handling.  I found that to be a refreshing change from most programming texts,  which seem to expend lots of ink on weird exceptions or the author's favorite math problems, then append slim chapters at the end of the work mentioning techniques that should have been used \\"in the real world\\".    Most code worked as written, and there are active errata pages available.  For the book's target audience, I suspect the failures I encountered would not present any issues.    Overall, an enjoyable read and well worth the time taken to work through the exercises.  I'll be using this at work as the basis of our internal training for one of our support groups which is transitioning from Perl to Python.      Disclaimer: I received access to an electronic copy of this book from O'Reilly Publishing for the purpose of writing this review.
B002P5XXR0|1.0|Very predictable music.    James Horner was only creative and orginal with the music of the Titanic.  I prefer much more Christopher Young, Michael Kamen, Bernard herrmann, etc.For the rest his music is very superficial.    But the public wants it, and it sells good. Who cares?  It says more about the public than the composer.
0143118706|5.0|First off, this book is not for everyone. As other reviewers have suggested, it is not the same kind of tale as Eat, Pray, Love. It is not just a memoir like the first book, but a reflection on what marriage is and what makes it successful.     What I really loved about this was how different Elizabeth's Gilbert's experiences and thoughts were from my own. I can relate to the love of travel and the desire to bring peace, understanding, and love into her life. But I couldn't relate to her intense fear of marriage, as it is described in the book.  (I married well into my thirties and, having no prior bad experiences, wanted to marry my guy with all my heart.) So it was a fascinating read for me, listening to her work her way through her fear through careful research on the institution of marriage. She peppers her newfound research and epiphanies throughout the tale of her and Felipe's wandering the globe while waiting for U.S. paperwork to go through.     She has this ideal and very adult relationship with Felipe, and you can't help admiring this couple as they pull back each onion layer and get to know each other more deeply. And of course, to get to that next layer, you've got the metaphorical tears and pain. It's rarely neat and pretty. Each has his or her moments of frustration and \\"hissy fits,\\" but the subsequent revelations make their bond that much stronger.    If you think about marriage and what makes it tick/work/flourish or if you wanted to know what happened next in Gilbert's tale, you will most likely enjoy this book. If you want a straight story like Eat, Pray, Love, then this book may not satisfy your craving.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I think this movie is fun, inventive, and really cute.  I love to watch the Colin Firth version of Pride and Prejudice first, then watch Lost in Austen and laugh at all the ways that the heroine screws up the classic story.  Then she tries so hard to fix things, which is even funnier.  I think the story remains true to the values and ideals of Jane Austen.  I can imagine that the heroine is Jane, herself, lost in her own book and seeing it from new angles.

Even thin people die of cardiovascular disease, and eating a low carb or paleo diet is likely to prevent it given the current research.    The book is well written, and entertaining. You should read it even if you've already read GCBC, as Taubes has some additional information and pictures.    I stopped eating sugar and refined carbohydrates about 10 months ago after reading GCBC, and I've lost about 40 lbs, but more importantly, I feel great and I'm never hungry. There is a huge online community of low-carb and paleo followers, so there's a lot of information and tips out there to help you. There are so many recipes, it's very easy to eat this way. It's also even easy when you're not at home to follow this diet, if you eat at a restaurant just get steak, or if you eat at a fast food place just get a huge burger and toss the bun.    It's amazing what passes for health research in this country. In my opinion, Taubes deserves a Nobel Prize for GCBC.

B003ZSJ212|3.0|First off, I want to state that I am not one of those Star War fanatics who had a coronary because Greedo shot first when Fox finally released the original trilogy on dvd several years ago. In fact, when the original trilogy first came out starting in 1977, I purposedly avoided them-mainly because I was more of a horror movie fan and not a sci-fi fan. Even though I did eagerly go to see \\"Alien\\" when it was first released  theatrically in 1979 {and loved it, by the way!} I considered Alien to more horror movie than sci-fi extravaganza. Seeing a big monster jump out and go 'boo' was more appealing to me than watching a bunch of space ships flying around zapping each other out of the sky.    Well, I'm still not a huge sci-fi fan, but I have come to embrace the Star Wars franchise {mainly the original trilogy} The stories that revolved around the original characters Luke, Hans and Princess Lea were engrossing, exciting and deeply moving. They were like a throwback to those great fantasy movies from the early sixties like 7th Voyage of Sinbad, Jason and the Argonauts, and the Magic Sword. However, I felt the charecters from the newer entries starting with The Phantom Menance on were rather stiff, emotionless and without true direction. In fact, the main purpose of the newer entries obviously was not to show how and why the conflict between the alliance and The Empire got started, but to show how and why Darth Vader was created. All 3 movies-Menace, Attack of the Clones, and Revenge of the Sith shouldn't have centered on this singular plotline. The original trilogy enveloped us into the lives of Hans, Luke, Lea, Obie wan, Vader and the 2 robots. The newer entries centered on the creation of Vader, and Obie Wan was literally reduced to the thankless role of faithful sidekick.    But enough about how great I think the original trilogy was. My reason for writing this review is to share my feelings about Mr. Lucas, and his constant need to tinker with his movies. Lucas is like a kid with a brand new toy that he doesn't know what to do with. He's been adding scenes and re-editing others in a futile attempt to create what he feels would be the 'perfect movies'. While I applaud him for improving the quality of some of the special effects in the earlier movies, I, like many other fans, totally disapprove of him adding a dubbed in \\"nooooooo...\\"  when Vader tosses the emperor down the shaft. The scene as it was originally shot played well enough. We fans don't need to hear Vader break down like a wimp in a terribly dubbed voice to know that he couldn't bear to see his beloved son suffer an excruitiatingly painful death at the hands of a man he didn't particularly like to begin with. I hate it when a filmmaker thinks so little of the intelligence of his audience that he feels that he has to create dialogue that explains every little scene that is showed.    In other words, if Lucas and 20th Century Fox truly want to create the perfect Star Wars dvd franchise, than they should concentrate thier efforts in putting out an ultimate edition with all the documentaries, deleted scenes, interviews and trailers that are available, and bundle them all in one final boxset. Then Lucas and the folks at Fox could spend the rest of their lives counting their profits and at the same time have a clear concience. If that day ever comes, then may the force be with them!
0312600844|4.0|Jonathan Franzen gives us another great read with this book. He returns to the Midwest to portray the American family of the decade - from pre-2001 to today. I could identify with his characters, was engaged by the plot, and looked forward to returning to the story each day. I wouldn't go so far as say it's the Book of the Decade, but Franzen can write and I enjoyed this book.
B000BSLU2S|3.0|I got this product along with a cpu cooler that turned out to be too big for my case so I had to reinstall the stock cpu cooler.  Core temps were no lower with this product than the original setup.  I later installed a different after market cpu cooler using this thermal grease and saw little if any reduction in core temps.  Certainly there's nothing wrong with Arctic Silver but it didn't live up to the hype.
0312427646|4.0|I was completely unprepared for this very amusing novella by Alan Bennett. Queen Elizabeth II discovers the mobile library while chasing after her corgis and, guided by the kitchen boy, finds herself lost in BOOKS! Every passionate reader will identify with her joy-in-reading-discoveries, and the complete lack of understanding of this joy by her family and surrounding staff. It was a pleasure to read.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|Good movie but all the talking that really wasn't needed could have been taken away. This isn't a bad  series it  is addictive but the thing is it's suppose to be a movie with vampires and wolves but the vampires where are their fangs they just gave the vampire different eye color and made them pale and call it a day even when they are angry I saw no fangs. Other than that nice movie love the action towards the end.

B0010KHOS0|5.0|I have been a casual Johnny Cash fan since I was a kid.  My main musical interest is classic and progressive rock. However, I have always really liked Johnny's music.  If you watch the extra's, you will see comments of love for Johnny by an odd array of artists including Kid Rock, Ozzy, Kris Kristofferson, Trent Rezner and others, proving Johnny trensended all muscial interests.  I also really like biographical movies such as The Aviator & A Beautiful mind and now I Walked the Line.  This is an outstanding movie, and like Johnny, it is very honest.  It was quite disturbing to learn of the depths of Johnny's drug, alcohol, relationship problems, and the pain of a youthful upbringing where his brother dies from an accident, and his Dad blames Johnny and emotionally tortures him throughout his life.  It is a story of a tortured individual who poured all of his life experiences into his songs.  Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon are absolutely amazing in their respective parts as Johnny Cash and June Carter.  They sing all of the songs themselves, and did an outstanding job.  The Extended Cut 2-DVD version has a 2nd disc that covers a lot of history about the making of the movie and the history of Johnny Cash.  Yes, it would have been awesome to see actual video of the Folsom Prison taping, but still contains an amazing amount of history and information.  The video quality is excellent, not sure it could be any better on Blu-Ray.  In summary, I would highly recommend this version of the movie due to the brutally honest and ultimately heart warming love story between Johnny Cash and June Carter, fantastic acting, great video quality, and lots of extra's, I love Johnny Cash and I loved this movie
B002ZG98UA|3.0|It's not bad the beginning took a while, I think the series is dwindling a bit the action are less and less and this set of cast was ok. I think they should quit while they are ahead now. It's still watchable and a good movie to watch but not the best.

044024367X|1.0|I have been reading each of Lee Childs' books in order, and to be honest, I am not sure what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />His writing is so-so, and his \\"mysteries\\" obvious and predictable. If you are interested in a truly great mystery writer, try Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch detective series, and if you like more violent action, Robert Crais' Joe Pike character.<br /><br />His lack of understanding of the military mind is irritating. Childs needs to study the American military subculture, as he makes so many obviously wrong statements on the general views most military officers share on politics and religion.<br /><br />As a retired career Air Force military officer and pilot who also spent a lot of time with the Army, I think Childs does not understand what a member of the American military officer corps thinks like or believes.<br /><br />This book was especially \\"out there\\", having Reacher (raised by a Marine father and a former MP himself) strongly support deserting from the service because he (Childs, obviously) disagrees with conservative politics and the war in Iraq. Talk about unrealistic?  He completely lost me from the book at that point.<br /><br />He also throughout the series makes a big deal out of an MP officer being \\"the baddest of the Bad\\" and trained to be an over the top street fighter.  Not so much.<br /><br />I like for a book to draw me in to its world, make me believe the things in it could really happen.  When an author is so heavy handed that his characters become preachy and excessively talky about ideas their character type would never espouse without the author's intervention, he loses me and my interest.<br /><br />His take on religion was also offensive, and his use of the term \\"Anglican\\" for one of the religious figures in the book was also wrong-- in America, this denomination is generally called Episcopal.  The character's description of the process of the writing of the Book of Revelation also is absolutely in error, and reflects Child's uneducated opinion of the process of early Christian writings becoming part of the Canon of the Bible.  (For the truth, read \\"From God to Us: How We Got Our Bible\\", by Dr Norman Geisler and William Nix)This is to be expected, I guess, when Childs tries to make Reacher the \\"smarter\\" atheist whenever he comes up against a person of faith, who is without exception psychotic, brutal, stupid, two-faced, corrupt, venal or weak.<br /><br />Childs needs to have someone edit his writing better for Anglicisms versus Americanisms, also.  Every book has some awkward Anglicisms in it that jar one out of immersion in the story-- how many Americans know what a \\"spanner\\" is?  If I hadn't owned a Jaguar in my misspent youth I wouldn't.  Or how many Americans know \\"binned\\" means thrown in the trash (\\"rubbish bin\\"), and isn't a misspelling of \\"bent\\"?<br /><br />I am also pretty tired of his obligatory sex scene in each new book.  His earlier books handled the subject in a more effective, understated way.  The sex scenes in his later books seem to be aimed at the teenage boy audience, with way more explicit detail than is necessary to get the point across.<br /><br />Childs' Reacher books have become so predictable in so many ways, they remind me of the formulaic Louis L'Amour westerns-- when the pretty girl is introduced early in the book, you know Jack will end up sleeping with her several times;  when the evil boss-man shows up, you know Reacher will beat him up at the minimum and most likely kill him;  when the big enforcer thug-type shows up, you know Reacher will beat him within an inch of his life or kill him.  The \\"big mystery\\" of each new book will be obvious early on if you pay attention to details, and from that point on, you might as well save yourself time and skim the pages until you get to the end.  There's always plenty of fluff you wouldn't need to waste your time on-- it adds nothing to the story line.  For instance, in this book Childs brings up many times that \\"Reacher knew that the average time for someone to answer their front door in the evening is 20 seconds.  Twenty three seconds later the front door opened.\\"  Oh, come on now.<br /><br />This book finally hit my gag reflex on so many levels.  I'm done spending my money on Childs' books.  If only Robert Crais or Michael Connelly could write faster!

0618918248|1.0|Various candidates have been put forward for the position of \\"the last man who knew everything\\". Richard Dawkins shouldn't be on the list. He wouldn't even qualify for the long list of runners up.  However brilliant he may be as a biologist and notwithstanding his gift for prose, he is a poor philosopher and an attrocious theologian. Perhaps he has spent more time studying in these fields than his book would lead you to believe.  If so, I respectfully suggest he spend more. He seems ignorant of major discussions in philosophical theology and traditional theology.  Or else he is so hell-bent (if you'll pardon the expression) on debunking the idea of God he is simply sloppy.  People inclined to be impressed by Dawkins' case should, I humbly submit, find the best theistic philosophers and theologians, read them, and then read or reread THE GOD DELUSION.  I'm no atheism but, frankly, atheism deserves better than the case Dawkins makes.

B000001EXB|5.0|I was a little shocked to read Elton in his Rolling Stone interview refer to this album as a perfect example of one that was done \\"just to get an album out.\\" These songs have a stylistic link to what Elton did in the Lion King songs that once again rejuvenated his image and brought in some new fans. Initial resistance to these songs is easy to explain. Long gone is the roots rock of the 70s. Thankfully gone also is the generic pop that marred many of his 80s albums.  There's very little electric guitar and the piano seems to be mostly reserved for solos toward the end of the songs. Like Madman Across the Water, strings play a big part in the sound and they are done very well. Big Picture doesn't have the two monster hits like Madman but overall the songs maintain a very high standard of quality that rivals all but the best of Elton's classic albums. There are 6 or 7 songs here that belong in any good career spanning collection. My faves being I Can't Steer My Heart, Recover Your Soul, and Live Like Horses. Its his best album of the 90s and catches him still in excellent voice.

B00192IV9U|5.0|My body decided for me.  Each time I listened to this album, my body would betray me.  My body did not care that these songs didn't get MJ's stamp of approval; it didn't matter if the songs weren't completed; and worst of all, my body didn't care about the controversy of a MJ poser singing these songs.  The only thing my body did care about was dancing, snapping my fingers, my mouth curving into a smile whenever I'd hear the verse \\"I Am Forever.\\"  Yes, MJ, you are forever.  I am digging these tunes. I'm loving it!  I don't know why these songs didn't make it, but sometimes what should get the artist's approval, doesn't and what does, shouldn't.  So there you go.  This is a rockin\\" album.  At times, MJ's voice is so young, the rawness is sweet.  There is something good about the imperfections. This album sounds fresh to me.  I think it belongs in every MJ lover's collection.
B0049OSQ18|4.0|After a couple of listenings the album started growing on me even though it is fairly different than the last few Decembrists CDS. the King is Dead & a couple of other songs I think are quite radio friendly (but probably won't make it on routine rock stations). I always seem to really like the songs with the accordian lead giving a sort of country-maritime flavor to a few of the songs. If you did not like Maloy's faux English accent on the prior CDs he does not use on this album. Much more \\"rootsier\\" along with Peter Buck's guitar on a bunch of tracks. I really believe this is one group that should be much more famous than it is.

B00005UT84|5.0|Haven't had any Caravan live albums since the New symphona album back in the early 1970ies. did not even know about this album until I started exploring Amazon for Caravan. I think it is phenomanal. If you like Caravan buy it now. If you never heard of Caravan might be a good first CD. But if you are not into the 1974 Canterbury jazz-rock-progressive-classical-pop sound you might not like it so much. And the extended guitar/viola sections are really spot on.

B0046UGSNS|3.0|When I first saw the trailer for the movie, I felt like it was a \\"been there, done that\\" type movie. After several \\"award show\\" nods, I decided to see for myself. Maybe I was wrong in my pre-assessment of another \\"Annette Bening/Julianne Moore\\" type movie (not a fan of either). So, I rented it and as expected, it was exactly as I expected. Boring, with a \\"California\\" liberal vibe (ie we are \\"different\\", so we'll make a movie about it). Guess what? This is just trite. Maybe if this was produced in the 90's instead of 2011, it might be of more value, but I didn't see anything interesting or redeeming about this movie. Maybe if you're still stuck in past era mentality, this might shed a bit of light on the subject of gay relationships with a family, but I'm not gay, live in a very conservative area, and still think this was just predictable and boring to watch (ie, been there, done that). I do have to say, the performance by Julianne Moore in a few scenes was surprising...and made it worthwhile (on a boring day) to watch, just to see a glimpse of a sometimes different character portrayal for her. It's not a horrible movie, but it was very predictable and well...boring for the most part. Mark Ruffalo deserved better.
B000Y7U98C|5.0|I *loved* this movie.  Probably because I knew nothing about it going in, and because I first saw it on the SyFy channel.  Believing it to be a SyFy original (which means horrible), I had low expectations.<br /><br />What I loved about the movie most is the singular focus displayed by most characters in the movie.  I was caught up in the hard choices and sacrifices that were made for the sake of their mission.  It was inspiring.  I thought Chris Evans was magnificent in projecting his character's fierce dedication to the mission.<br /><br />Oh yeah, the soundtrack was wonderful.  I'd rank it up there above some of my favorites: Jurassic Park and Braveheart.<br /><br />Sure, there are some technical inconsistencies, the special effects were average at best, and the plot got a little off-track near the end.  But I'm willing to let that slide.  I *loved* this movie.
1439148953|5.0|Rose and Eilis Lacey are sisters.  Eilis has had bookkeeping classes.  She is given a job working at a shop on Sundays.  Rose works in an office at Davis Mills.  Her mother has a pension.  The boys, Pat, Martin, and Jack, have gone to Birmingham to find work.      Rose is thirty.  Most of her friends are married.  Father Flood points out that there is work for someone like Eilis at good pay in the United States.  He says it would be a good opportunity and it would not be dangerous to live in his parish.  Eilis gives notice.  She is going to America.  Eilis's going to America means that Rose can never marry.  Their mother cannot be left alone.      Eilis lands in the United States in possession of a full work permit.  This is unusual.  She stays with Mrs. Kehoe in Clinton Street.  Tea and milk taste strange.  Eilis is reminded, when she receives letters from home,  that her own life in Enniscorthy has been lost and she may never have it again.  Eilis has a problem at work.  She cannot smile.  She is homesick.      The book is a wonder.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was the best of the three different versions I have seen.  The scenery, the clothing, etc..... Everything just made you feel like you were there, wtching it happen.  Done superbly. Acting is wonderful as well.  One not to miss.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|Megadeth used to have a harmonic sensibility but somewhere along the way they gave it up to make loud noisy sounds and call it music.  Slowly though they have been returning to making what I would call music rather than noise.  This album is ok, but look for their next release because it should be a great album if they continue in the progression of taste.
076115728X|5.0|This book is by far the most touching book for a jaded adult/child as myself.  If this book had been read to me by the jaded superiors in my life I would have had so much more confidence within.  Thank you so much!  I have handed out a number of these books hoping the parents will read and be able to be touched too!
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Im going to say right off I was never a Metallica fan until I saw them live with GNR and Faith No More.  All my friends loved them to death, and I had been forced to drive around aimlessly for hours on back country roads listening to their tapes.  Then I saw them live and it all clicked, and I found that I unconsciously knew every song.  Anyway, I still didnt rush out and buy their albums, I think I owned the Black album but sold it off, and didnt follow them at all until I found their whole catalog for a buck each at a rummage sale.    I listened to their post Black material and thought \\"hmnn this is pretty good stuff\\", and then I put in St Anger and gagged, wondering \\"could this be the same band?\\"    The last album I played was Death Magnetic.  The best way to describe this is to compare it to the frenetic energy of  ...and Justice for all meets the pop sensibilities of the Black album (shorter, catchier lyrics). The thing about this album that outdoes the other two is that it is incredibly intelligent, as they are constantly changing riffs and tempo within each song. Just when you think the song peaked they raise the level of energy that much higher, taking you on quite a ride.  If you like hard rock, metal or intelligent sounds, you will love this album.
0465043577|5.0|I didn't know who Mandelbrot was, I just knew his name from Taleb his books on randomness. I also red his name a few times in the market wizard books, and was kind of curious at his findings.<br />This book is a terrific read. It's really good structured and written. If you like to read on statistics, the mathematical models employed in the financial world or the distributions of prices you'll certainly like reading this one. I already had a rather good understanding of the financial models from the past years, like CAPM, APT, Black & Scholes and VAR models. I  had already heard before something was wrong with these models their assumptions on prices following a normal probability distribution, but not exactly what. This book made it completely clear to me. The whole assumption on normality is completely wrong. As if that ain't enough, a lot of the other assumptions are also fundamentally wrong. Like Mandelbrot says, it's a house of cards.<br /><br />Most helpful in this book are the explanations from the author on what a normal distribution is, how Gauss developed his probability curve and how it's widely used in a lot of scientific fields. Also how he demonstrated why prices aren't normal distributed (with the n sigma examples) and how he tried to figure the probability distributions behind cotton prices.<br /><br />I really had a great read with this book and think everyone who works on the financial markets should read this book.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This one is harder and more dancey, and catchier than her first album.  I remember when I first saw the Fame on the shelves and thought \\"I should probably buy that\\" but I resisted and then Poker Face blew up everywhere and I still didnt buy it until Amazon had a special on her two CDs a few months ago.  I bought them and they are great, lots of fun, but this one is far superior.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi is an exceptionally riveting movie about the last 50 years of Gandhi's life and more notably the story of overcoming adversity and racial discrimination.  The movie shows us the prejudice and discrimination norms against Indians in not only India but in South Arica, both controlled by the British Empire. These immoral acts against fellow man sparked Gandhi's lifelong journey to bring peace among all races and eventually the independence of India from British rule.  The story brings to light the personal sacrifice people are willing to make in an attempt to bring peace to a race or culture that is seen as inferior to another.  There are scenes that are similar in nature to events that took place during Martin Luther King's era and the African American's march to freedom.   The story begins with a 24-year old Gandhi riding a train in first class.  After being confronted for being an Indian in first class he is thrown off the train, even though he is a London educated lawyer.  He then realizes that there are several South African laws that are biased against Indians and decides to take a stand.  He begins a non-violent protest campaign which quickly draws followers and popularity among Indians in South Africa.  After numerous arrests and the unwanted attention of the world, the British government gives in and gives right to Indians.  He is seen as a hero in India and is invited back to his homeland to aid in the fight for independence.   After returning home to India he takes time to travel and witnesses the state of poverty that his people in are.  He agrees to help fight for freedom and starts another non-violent, non-cooperating civil protest campaign.  This time around seems to be more difficult, however, given the millions of Indians nationwide and the uncertainty that all will conform to such non-violent ways.  There are several setbacks including extreme violence against the protestors and the occasional imprisonment of Gandhi himself.  Nevertheless, thecampaign generates huge attention from all over the world the British government come under great public pressure.  After World War II, Britain is too weak to continue controlling India and grants the country independence.  Gandhi is now seen as the father of India and is greatly admired.   Even though Indians are now free and able to establish their own country, they have many tasks including keeping peace between Hindus and Muslims.  After much discussion, parts of the former western British India, where Muslims were the majority, were separated into Pakistan.  This is something that Gandhi did not agree to because he wanted all races to live together peacefully.  After India and Pakistan were separated into their own countries, violence between Muslims and Hindus erupted through all of the two countries.  Equally so millions of people between both cultures were displaced and forced to move into either country.  This disturbed Gandhi deeply and declares he will fast until all fighting stops.  He does so and almost to the point of death.  This causes violence, at least on the side of the Hindus, to slowly cease.  There is a scene where an angry Hindu man approaches a very weary Gandhi.  He states that the violence has stopped and tosses a piece of bread onto Gandhi demanding he eat it.  The man then admits to killing a Muslim child because Muslims had killed his son.  Gandhi tells the man in order to avoid hell raise a child, whom Muslim parents are dead, and raise him as a Muslim.   Peace exists between the Muslims and Hindus and Gandhi returns to his motivated loving ways.  It seems that most people who are successful in bringing some form of peace leave this earth too soon, as is the case with Gandhi.  In the movie he talks about how ruthless, murderous rulers die and their ideas with them.  The only philosophy that lives on is peace and love for everyone.  Gandhi is shot at point blank range three times by angry Hindu doing the work of someone else.  Though Gandhi is murdered, his ideas of peace live on.  Peace always wins.    Steven M. Christin

B001HN6940|4.0|Give Johnny Depp a chance to don fantastic make-up and costumes and pair him up with director Tim Burton, and you can expect something bizarre and creepy. \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (2001 in 3D and IMAX) takes great liberties with Lewis Carroll's books, and drags them into the world of the surreal, the violent, and nuttsyland. There's a lot of claptrap and scary stuff in this one, and I think it will frighten some younger tykes. The bad Red Queen with a huge head literally and figuratively is played by Helena Bonham Carter. \\"Off with their heads\\" is her constant refrain.<br /> At the beginning of the movie when Alice is among ordinary people, she doesn't look well with those dark circles under her eyes, kind of a haunted look. Mia Wasikowska plays Alice. A young woman, she is at her engagement party, and she doesn't want to marry the foolish fop her mother is pushing on her. She wanders off and drops into the world she had been in as a child, Underland or Wonderland with its weird characters. Alice's father had told Alice all the best people are mad so she shouldn't worry about her fanciful imaginings.<br /> Johnny Depp plays the Mad Hatter, and he becomes a pivotal character. There's Tweedledum and Tweedledee, the fat roly-poly twins, the March Hare, the disappearing Chesire Cat, the hookah-smoking Blue Caterpillar (Abosolom), and the White Rabbit. At one point Depp recites part of Lewis Carroll's famous poem \\"The Jabberwocky\\" in which Carroll used some of his invented portmanteau words. The jabberwocky is a species of dragon that Alice has to slay on a Frabjous Day.<br /> If you are looking for a faithful rendition of Carroll's 1865 masterpiece, you best look elsewhere. This is kind of a mishmash with fantastic colors and special effects. Alice grows to giant size by drinking a potion and then shrinks to tiny size by eating cake. The Bandersnatch is a monster pursuing Alice, The aim is to depose the evil Red Queen and reinstate the good White Queen.<br /> On its own terms, disregarding fidelity to its source, this movie can be fun and also enlightening because of all the interesting vocabulary introduced. It's a deluscious treat. Carroll might turn over in his grave, but Disney would probably be pleased by the result though it's not as tame as his original stuff.ing fidelity to its source, this movie can be fun and also enlightening because of all the interesting vocabulary introduced.

B003Q6D25K|1.0|All the people that believe demons are responsible for some percentage of the 150,000 people reported missing each year and that demons have an obsession (despite all their beyond human imagination powers) of getting off on falling kitchen utensils; opening/closing doors; using remote control toy cars; watching pool vacuums jump out of the water; have an affinity for female Spanish speaking maids all of whom have a unique insight into demon behavior; think that they have nothing better to do than drag people by their feet or toss them about like a doll (how convenient for cameras) then you need to incorporate your highest educational level obtained into your five star rating review.     As far as the docudrama it's another ripoff with the customary infant to add some vulnerability; bouncing hand held camera; security cameras with time displays of course; some animal (for their astute hearing). By the way does that mean that all the animals of the world are continually freaking out for what must be millions of demons floating about and why is it always a dog or cat? Why not a hamster or a turtle?     Horror movie? Let me think. The first half hour is watching a swimming pool vacuum move about. Second half hour - same thing with added falling kitchen utensil and kitchen cabinet doors opening. Third half hour the remote toy car moves and a couple of people get special effects dragging for a few seconds. End of movie with the usual disclaimer that someone disappeared - see the above number. By the way a high percentage of missing people are kidnappings by family or friends.
B003Y5H51K|3.0|The biggest, deepest cave in the world, lots of water, rumblings, a cyclone up above--danger and perils everywhere. If you are claustrophobic, fear tight underground spaces and being breathless under water, and if you fear clich&eacute;s and stereotypes, it might be well if you avoid \\"Sanctum.\\" If you're short of cash, you may not want to pay a premium to see this epic in 3D (It's also available in 2D).<br /> This is almost one of those \\"And Then There Were None\\" sagas, because characters are drowning very regularly in this one. There is a classic battle going on between a strong-willed father and an equally determined son. The stubborn, tyrannical father has spent his adult life exploring caves with great danger to himself and to those around him. He's a cold-blooded, some would call a maniacal spelunker. Cave exploration, it seems, involves mountain-climbing skills, underwater diving, toying with death, and conflict-management.<br /> Of course in such an endeavor you have to have an ambitious, willful, selfish, risk-taking villain who defies orders, is nasty and puts others at risk. For most of the 109 minutes of movie running time, you are in these caves that are lit well enough to see the actors, and it's bright enough to see them get knocked off. There are no creatures down there to threaten them which may put off some animal enthusiasts in the audience.<br /> The actors all do a credible job, but I never heard of any of them. James Cameron was executive producer, but it doesn't look as if he played a very active part in the creative end of the production. The special effects are not particularly noteworthy.<br /> There's excitement, suspense, and you can't help becoming involved, but somehow it lacks that creative spark that's needed. It's non-stop action which younger viewers liked. One thing I discovered about 3D movies. Look at them without the glasses and the picture is brighter, the colors are sharper.
B00110K62U|5.0|I was skepetcal about this DVD because of some of the negative reviews.  We LOVED it and have watched/listened to it several times...the music is wonderful and the video was perfectly fine.  Maybe we're not picky enough...but we really enjoyed it!
B003XWEQ1G|4.0|Having not read any extensive reviews prior to seeing this movie, I went in a little blind - so I was pretty surprised that the story was basically a prequel to the kind of Robin Hood stories we all think of when we hear that name. While most Robin Hood media focus on his time in Sherwood Forest tormenting the Sheriff of Nottingham with his steal-from-the-rich antics, this movie actually tells the tale of how Robin Longstride, a common archer in the King's army, eventually became the outlaw known as Robin Hood. Disappointingly, they never really say how he managed to become such an incredible archer. He already seems to have mastered that art before the start of the movie. The screenplays & special effects of some of his shots are quite nice, however. I really enjoyed the way Ridley Scott worked hard to keep historical accuracy present in this movie while preserving key elements of the Robin Hood tale. As you progress through the historical elements of the story (Richard the Lionheart sacking castles & eventually dying; King John's greedy rule), Robin's personal story leads him to meet people like Little John, Friar Tuck, Marian, and several other familiar names. The movie was terrifically cast, gorgeously costumed and designed, and overall very enjoyable to watch.    In short, I'd say it was one of the more underrated movies of its year, and it deserved way more credit than it got!
B000RZIGVS|2.0|Well, I purchased a copy from a very well-reviewed marketplace seller on here, and sure enough - it was a bootleg version.    Since I contacted the seller and they seemed to be as legitimately shocked as I was that they were selling bootlegs, I promised them I would not reveal who they were here on the promise that they would stop selling their copies immediately and contact their wholesaler.    Anyway, there's a few things to look for that will indicate you have the bootleg:    - The insert and poster are missing from the set    - The discs are packaged in lime-green (instead of transparant green) casings with two discs on the same side (Paramount's official version has one disc on the front/one disc on the back of each casing).  The bootleg discs also have plastic sleeves over each DVD.  While Paramount's casings are molded together (much like the Voyager season sets and other releases), the bootleg copies are merely held together with some tape.    - The bootleg discs are single-layered, while the legit discs are dual-layered (you can check this on your computer...if a disc says it has 4.7 GB of info (or 4.8 GB), you've got yourself a bootleg!)    - Finally, some posters have claimed that if the back (shiny part!) of your DVD says \\"STAR TRER\\" around the inner circle, you have the bootleg.  This may be true, but mine DID say \\"STAR TREK\\" and were the bootlegs...so this typo seems to have been fixed by those sending out the faux versions!    Hope this info is helpful...does anyone know/can confirm that Amazon sells the LEGIT sets.  Would like to hear from those who bought directly from Amazon and see if they got the bootleg copies as well.
B003UBTX7C|4.0|After reading some of the reviews on this book, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by this book. While it is not as good as some of the previous books in this series, it was a good read. Kept me interested and was a good if somewhat predictable read.
0470913029|4.0|The Paleo Diet is another version of a low-carb diet that focuses what ancient man (cavemen) probably ate.  The author contends that the human body was created to eat those kinds of foods and will be healthiest as a result.    What I liked about this book is that what is allowed is healthy: lean meat, fish, and seafood; some nuts and a little \\"good\\" fat, fruit and non-starchy vegetables, and no processed or refined foods.  The author makes the case that most of our modern diseases, including allergies and digestive problems, are the result of processed foods and ingredients that are non-foods never meant for human consumption, calling the American diet a nutritional nightmare. I agree. He also promotes eating local, organically raised and grown meats and produce, something that makes sense if they are available and affordable.    However, anyone considering this diet should know that it is quite strict and eliminates all cereals, grains (including rice) and flours and anything made with them; legumes (beans and peanuts), dairy products, and salt.  That may make this plan unrealistic for many people to follow in the long-term, as usually happens when a diet eliminates complete food groups.    I know from personal experience that a low-carb diet works for people like me who are insulin resistant so as plan to kick-start weight loss, get back on track nutritionally, and to help reverse things like metabolic syndrome, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, this book has good information.  While I don't see it as a plan I could realistically stick with for long periods at a time as presented, I do like the book as a reference and came away with ideas that will help me with a low-carb diet.
B003ZK58WM|1.0|As we have seen over the past few weeks in Egypt, our voices can make a difference.   The way to make an impact on high e-book price gouging is simple.  Don't buy this e-book or any other book from Penguin Publishing    I don't care how good the book is, that is more than I will spend and the only recourse I have is to try and convince others to make a difference by boycotting and being vocal about it through social media.

B004K4IZ3G|2.0|first - this review is simply on the unavailability (so far) of digital copy without having to buy the 3D disc along with it. sad marketing ploy if you ask me. we deserve the choice of getting a digital copy without being forced to buy a 3D disc we will never have a use for. im fine with the dvd + blu-ray combo though..i just know without a shadow of a doubt i will never purchase anything 3D related. im optimistic that they will put out another package option before release date hits...i hope.    second - it was only shown in 3D near me at theaters, so i wasnt able to go see it. sure i could have but I refuse to perpetuate 3D as a good thing, because its not. 1 in 4 people get sick, or get headaches when they watch a 3D movie. not to mention some people already have to wear glasses to watch movies, and dont want to wear another pair making the first uncomfortable. along with the other obvious problems such as increased PRICE because thats all 3D is: just another excuse to increase the price of something.
B002ZG981E|5.0|I truly had no idea what to expect when I first saw 'Inception', but I was amazed at how mind blowing this film was. The best advice I can give is, the less you know about this film the better, I've tried to explain it to friends and family but its hard to put into words. I highly reccommend this film to anyone who wants a truly unique movie going experience, however don't ask what is it about, just watch this incredible film and judge it for yourself. I guarantee you will not be disappointed!

Who can resist \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" and \\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\\" and the wonderful \\"Gabriel's Oboe\\"? Yo Yo Ma is at his best and when paired with the amazing talent of Enzio Morricone you truly have a beautiful CD, worth playing again & again. You will love it!
1594202842|5.0|This is a book about a mother's love for her daughters and her family. As a story of one family's challenges and triumphs, it's a vivid and moving portrayal of the values that come from having immigrant parents. Chua, the daughter of Chinese immigrants, was raised in a loving home but one that demanded hard work and discipline -- values she saw her own parents exhibit in spades as they made a new life in America. The strength Chua cultivated in herself because her parents had high expectations enabled her to recognize her own children's strength, too. Her love for Sophia and Lulu meant giving them the same gift of resilience. As a mother, Chua was in the trenches: she went to all the recitals and lessons, wrote (unbelievably) detailed notes for her daughter's practice routines, had an insane schedule flying across the country, and put in hours of hard work to make sure her daughters did the same. This is not the story of a \\"show parent\\" setting high expectations and sitting back. For Chua, you practice what you preach. And when Chua's sister fell ill, and when her mother-in-law was ill, her daughters saw Chua practice patience, compassion, and, above all, love and loyalty to family.      Further, Chua didn't just set high expectations for performance in music or school. She had high expectations for her daughters as people. When her mother-in-law passed, she made sure she did everything she could so that her daughters wrote heartfelt and moving statements. She took them on world travels and exposed them to other cultures, pushing them to try new experiences. She returned the quickly fashioned birthday cards her daughters gave her -- because she took her obligations to her family seriously, she expected her children to do the same. And, after that, they did.       This is such a vital contribution to the national dialogue because Chua's values are at heart the ones that America was founded on: strength and toughness, but also basic goodness and compassion. Love too often today is equated with permissiveness. Chua knows that love also means recognizing that strength, skill, and good character don't arise merely from knowing that you're loved and affirmed -- they arise from determination, hard work and actually being tested by the world. Whatever others say, it's more than clear by the end of the book that Sophia and Lulu can lay claim to that.     This book has changed the way I will think about parenting when I start my family.

B003AYDPYQ|5.0|Breaking Bad plays out more like a segmented movie than a television series.  There are episodes that delve in to the human psyche, those that question beliefs, those that expose the reality of human responses and others that surprise the hell out of you.  Expressive, intellectual and ingenious writing... beautiful cinematography and direction... unforgettable acting... these are the cornerstones of a gripping, compelling and addictive show that i can (have) watch over and over again.  Don't start with season 3 if you are a first time viewer.  It will pull you in from the first 10 minutes of episode 1, season 1.  Have fun...
0143036424|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed THE COLD DISH and its protagonist, Sheriff Walt Longmire of Absaroka County, Wyoming. It combines a page-turning \\"who-done-it\\" with intelligent humor, a completely flawed but likable protagonist, his wise and patient native American friend Henry Standing Bear, and wonderful evocations of the setting in the West.<br /><br />I laughed out loud at some of the dry dialogue between Longmire and Henry. Henry, a Vietnam vet, is deeply spiritual and steeped in native American traditions and beliefs...always understated in his pronouncements. Walt is a widower with a grown daughter who has, since his wife died, slipped into slovenly living conditions and habits. Henry is determined to get him to shape up and open up, and this is the source of some of the funnier scenes, especially when Henry is pushing Walt to start dating again. There is a hilarious scene after Walt has been invited by a woman to dinner in which Henry is trying to coach Walt about how to select a wine to take.<br /><br />There's a surprising amount of depth to this book -- philosophical musing by one character or another that is touching and thought-provoking. The thread of native American spirituality is interesting and rings true. The plot itself includes some dark elements that involve the brutal rape of a mentally handicapped girl and the apparent revenge killings of the young men involved. In his tracking of the killer(s), Walt finds himself embroiled in complex and competing loyalties that plumb the depths of both human depravity and courage.<br /><br />I'll definitely be reading more of the Walt Longmire books in the future.
B0040T77D0|4.0|What a great one shot at a musical career for Linda Perhacs. The songs are very deep in thought and the music is smooth. The way this album came out it is to bad that Linda did not record more. To find this title remastered was a treat for me. The 60's were very creative with or with out the help of other substances. If your looking for a Psych / Folk album then this one is worth buying. I rather listen to vinyl then cd because it sounds better, but that is my choice.    A very enjoyable album and worth a couple of plays everytime I bring it out.
006097625X|5.0|This is a book on comics \\"theory\\", as in \\"music theory\\". It is exactly what the title claims: a breakdown and analysis of what comics do, as a communication medium, and how they do it. McCloud examines comics as they are now and demonstrates-believably-how comics operate in ways that text alone cannot. For example, it isn't a history of comics or a how-to book for aspiring comics artists, but McCloud does show different ways of drawing the same thing, and points out how each different style carries a slightly different message for the reader. So the same aspiring comics artist won't learn how to draw from this book, but he or she could learn how better to make the point he or she is trying to make. This book is a serious, thoughtful, clear, and well-researched essay presented as a comic book.
B003AYBC64|5.0|The Heart of Saturday is a very nice follow up to Closing Time.This is a vinyl pressing that was remastered in 2010 and is as quiet a pressing as I have in my collection. The one thing about Tom is his voice. If you do not like a gruff sounding singer then stay away for all of his music. The stories he tells with his music keep you interested from start to finish. The music on the album, as is on most of his album's has a lot of bass and it is not miss placed at all.   If you like a type of Jazz / Rock sound I believe you will like Tom Waits. Just sit back and absorb  all of the sounds of this album,the next thing you know your very relaxed and wanting more.
B002SL4PKK|5.0|Prior to buying this product I had heard a lot of hype about Dawkins but never really paid any attention. I was raised as a firm believer in Creation and taught the reasons why Evolution was so 'ridiculous', after losing my earlier faith I began to wonder what the other side of the story was. This CD book was wonderful it explained the theory of evolution in a manner that I had never heard before, for the first time I learnt that the theory doesn't teach we came from monkeys, but that we had common ancestors. The writer is extremely erudite, but at the same time manages to keep the information at a level that doesn't go over the listeners head. Many people had told me that Dawkins is very anti-religious, but I didn't get that impression from listening to this. He evinces a dislike for a certain type of religion, doesn't seem opposed to all religion.    14 CD's seems like a lot and it took me a while to get through, but the benefit of having it on CD was being able to listen to it in the car. I did end up buying the book later for the ability to make notes in the margin something that CDs can't replace.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|and yes, when tron legacy came out, freaks who didnt have nor seen the original movie, went ahead and bought the first dvd edition of tron. some payed 80, some over 100 dollars,(the nerd rage was too much). i blame both the sellers and buyers. the sellers for taking advantage of the high demand situation, the buyers for being so stupid and desperate.    well look now!!  only 2 months away you can buy the newest, restored special ed for less than 20 bucks..    this is why waiting is important. sucks to be a nerd doesn't it ????    i'l wait my sweet time to get the blu ray copy.. ;)
B001MYIXAC|3.0|This is the Swedish movie that was remade into the US version of Let Me In.  It is dubbed in English. I did not feel this movie had enough action, compared with today's vampire movies. Also maybe the dubbing to English took more depth and understanding from the movie.
B003L20IJM|3.0|This one didn't have the \\"atmosphere\\" that the first one did. Didn't seem to go as deep. I enjoyed the very beginning and the end, with a few giggles in between. My 7 and 9 year old liked it, but would rather watch the first one again.
B001KX50BK|3.0|Naysayers damn this movie as fantasy, fantasy lovers like it for its fairy tale. Yet I think its the truth in full color. How many powerful rich men do you see with gold-digging arm-candy wives?  Answer: All of them. If not yet, then soon, or they have them on the side. Why? Because they can.   So enough with the pseudo-intellectual criticisms of this movie; its true enough.   Julia and Richard just make it look really good.  Julia's performance is the only good one in this flick, seconded by Jason Alexander.  You see Julia's character change and her simpler nature come through. And there's the music.      Take it for what it is, a glossy piece of entertainment.
B0049GYXDG|1.0|Be careful if you plan to pre-order a DVD. Amazon charged me $24.99 [[ASIN:B0049GYXDG Alice In Wonderland (Two-Disc 60th Anniversary Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]] to pre-order the Alice in Wonderland 60th Anniversary two-disk combo. Now the actual after-release price is $19.99. I will never pre-order again. The DVD is OK. Amazon's business ethics are not.
B000Y7U98W|1.0|THis DVD will only play on blu -ray players.  If you have a PS3 blu - ray player, the movie won't work.  No where on the movie cover/label itself does it have any kind of info saying this.  It was a waste of my time, THEN I got charged from Amazon the return shipping fee!  Not fair!
B004MDZWOU|5.0|This was a great episode. I was disappointed with earlier episodes this season. Too often, the producers decide to separate the brothers and place them in unfamiliar settings. Also, earlier this season, wonderful side characters like Bobby and Cass were missing from the show. Now - the producers are finally working with the formula that fans like: interaction with the brothers, a hunt, Bobby, Cass -- plus an intriguing ending. Do more like this -- rely less on gimmicks.
0062024329|5.0|Though the story is slightly different here and there, it stays true to the original tale. The illustration is great and I like the characters. All in all I am pleased and recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the original tale and likes graphic novels.
B00005JN0T|3.0|I don't think I've yet to see an Isaac Asimov story successfully brought to film.  With the exception of Fahrenheit 451, I could say the same for Ray Bradbury.  Anyway, leaving behind all references to the original material, I was initially disappointed in the screen adaptation of \\"I Robot.\\"  To no great surprise, within a short time I forgot everything about the film.  Curious to take a second look, I did so (on DVD) and found that I enjoyed the flick more sitting at home than viewing it in a movie theater.  Maybe upon a second viewing, I came into it expecting little and, therefore, wasn't nearly as disappointed.  Knowing there would be almost no \\"heady\\" material, I just sat back and watched things getting thrashed around.  The FX seemed fine to me.  In keeping with the lightweight material, I enjoyed Will Smith's performance much more.  He has some good one-liners, and maintains an almost light-hearted demeanor throughout any catastrophe, which some may claim as campy.  I decided to purchase this DVD because I knew that in another several months or a year, I'd forget everything about the story entirely.  This is fine with me because I'm not always in the mood to watch something memorable.  Maybe I'm nuts but I sometimes enjoy popping in a DVD that rings no bells, sitting back and thinking, \\"Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah,\\" as if being brought to remember some half-forgotten dream of no particular significance.  I find it fun.  So, for those who have a short-term memory problem, go ahead and buy this film (which can be purchased for a pittance).
0385528752|5.0|Once i started reading it i couldn't stop.  I brought along a pen and paper and started taking notes.  While reading it, I started applying the Heat's ideas like directing the rider, motivating the elephant on my team of 18.    The first results are remarkable...    The book is clearly written, removes ambiguity and helps shape the path for change.    I simply love this book and i recommend it to anyone who struggles to achieve change and wants ideas on how to get it done.
0880793082|2.0|The description of \\"Small\\" is misleading.  This deck comes in three sizes and this is the MEDIUM one.  I wanted another copy of this deck in the small version, and these arrived.  Granted, I should have looked up the dimensions, but I was in a hurry and trusted the title.  I read full-time and these medium and large decks are very hard on my hands.  The truly small ones really work best.  The Crowley deck is fantastic.  Unfortunately, this seller is misrepresenting the size.
B002NS2HBM|5.0|Even though this series began in 2001, it's incredible to see how well it is done, even now.  The actors are phenomenal! I've never been addicted to any TV series but Alias was able to hook a guy who never thought it possible!  The story line is incredible!  10 stars!
0061353248|4.0|Mr. Ariely provides interesting and funny examples of biased behavior, like the psychological effect of \\"free\\" or the role of preconceptions in our perception of cheap vs. expensive. He also gives interesting examples of how a relationship can be perceived as a social one vs. an economic one and how this perception alters completely our behavior. When you bring some economic factor into a social relationship it immediately turns into an economic one and our behavior changes accordingly. To turn the realtionship again into a social one is more difficult. This section really made me think...    \\"Predictably irrational\\" and [[ASIN:0070504776 The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making (McGraw-Hill Series in Social Psychology)]] excellently complement each other. Whereas Mr. Plough's book explains how we deviate from what would be a \\"rational\\" decision making, it does not explain the process we really use to make decisions. Mr. Plough makes obvious that we are not very \\"rational\\" (defined as optimizing net value); Mr. Ariely explains some ways in which we actually do make some of these decisions.    The book is a very easy and interesting reading, but does not form a coherent whole; it is more like a selection of examples that illustrate the way we behave. I would say a comprehensive theory is still to be established. Since more and more people are now devoted to the study of neuroeconomics, behavioral economics, heuristics and other related fields, we will probably and hopefully soon witness the emergence of a more integrated theory of decision making.
030745455X|2.0|I swore, after reading the \\"Girl/Tattoo\\" that I wouldn't read the sequel! Even a long flight with a long layover shouldn't be enough to explain why I'd waste several hours on this 'trash' thriller. What's trashy about it? Well, it's utterly mindless and there's the empty violence and the sadistic small-core porn aspects, but who could be bothered by any of that these days? It's the prosaic writing that's trashy... never a pause in the trudge of sentences, never an outline that's not eventually filled in, no uncatalogued clues, as dreary in its sobriety as a worker's compensation evaulation. Was there ever any doubt about the outcome? The quirks of paternity were unexpected but too contrived to be other than boring. And yet I read the whole drab sprawl, 500 pages ... I'm a glutton for words.<br /><br />My only excuse is that I like reading in Swedish. The only part of the book that brought a brief smile to my weary face was when Salander went shopping at IKEA and our complusive Swedish author listed every item of furniture with its absurd catalogue name.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Easily one of the best fantasy novels I've read in a long time. Right up there with George R.R. Martin as far as quality of storytelling. Maybe even better in some ways because of the unique way that the story is told. Hearing the main character's life story told from the perspective of the actual character really gives you the feeling of being there.<br /><br />The bottom line is that I spent a lot of time looking for a good new story to read and I definitely found it. I can't recommend this one enough and am very glad to know that I only have a few short weeks to wait before jumping into Book 2.
B00000IQC8|3.0|Everybody has probably seen Clerks 2 before this one because of its popularity. Clerks is in black and white the entire length of the movie, that is not to say its bad.  It does have its funny moments, but nothing that will make you curl over laughing like Clerks 2.  I believe this first movies kind of introduces Randal's and Dante's personalities.Not a bad movie, but overall maybe 3stars.
0140557741|5.0|This book is fabulous and can be used for a great team building game.  Members of a group are given pictures from the book and they must put them in order without showing each other their pictures.  The group I bought the book for had a great time!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|The Social Network is one of those movies where you see a comercial for and say \\"How can that be good\\", well i have to say this is one of the best movies of 2010.

B004NFB4EO|5.0|This song is really great and people should look past the gossip about it. It slightly sounds like a Madonna song but to say that it copies Madonna is far fetched. This song has a strong powerful message and it is good to hear a Lady Gaga song that is not about sex or partying. If you want a great song then this is the one for you, so put your paws up to great music.
B0042KZJ46|4.0|as there are already many reviews which say everything (it's a historical document with very good sound quality and although not being Marley's best show, it's definitely worth buying it as there are great renditions of many well-known hits and fans' favourites), I just want to share some further information I have gathered for those who are interested in more background information about this release and this concert:<br /><br />the original soundboard tape covers the opening I-Three set, and the whole Marley set until the tape runs out about 30 seconds before the segue from \\"Work\\" to \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\". for this release they remastered the whole tape to the best quality you can get, but they cut out the incomplete part of \\"Work\\" and instead took the two last songs from a \\"secondary\\" source which is actually an audience recording.<br /><br />Most illegal bootlegs cover \\"Natural Mystic\\" to \\"Is This Love?\\". they used to be sped up, and have the audience cheering between the songs cut out, so it can fit on one disc. on this release most transitions have been preserved uncut.<br /><br />What still remains a big mystery to me is the quality of the audience recording they used for the last two songs \\"Work\\" and \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\". the original audience recording (which also covers the audience noise after \\"Could You Be Loved?\\" and the following song \\"Is This Love?\\", as well as the noise of people leaving after \\"Get Up, Stand Up\\") has much better sound, clear and very crisp and well-balanced regarding the fact that it's an audience recording... they definitely worsened the sound for some (legal?) reasons... if you want to get hold of the above-mentioned original audience source you can easily find it in the internet.<br /><br />Another interesting fact not mentioned anywhere is that Ian Wynter replaced Earl Wya Lindo on this show for some reason. you can hear Junior Marvin shouting \\"Brother Ian\\" while introducing the band towards the end of \\"Exodus\\".<br /><br />if you are interested in the source of the photos on the album cover, they were made by Peter Murphy. the front picture and the one inside in the middle (Marley stretching out his right arm) are both from Zurich, Switzerland at the Hallenstadion on May 30, 1980. the one with Marley carrying his guitar and shaking his dreads as well as the one on the back cover are most likely from Copenhagen at the Forum on June 18, 1980.n the album cover, they were made by Peter Murphy. the front picture and the one inside in the middle (Marley stretching out his right arm) are both from Zurich, Switzerland at the Hallenstadion on May 30, 1980. the one with Marley carrying his guitar and shaking his dreads as well as the one on the back cover are most likely from Copenhagen at the Forum on June 18, 1980.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|Damon Medic says, \\"The Polar Express\\" is one of the most uniquely original films of our time.  It is certainly not your typical Christmas movie.  In fact, it has a very mysterious, dark overtone to it, even when it comes to the depiction of the North Pole.  Santa and the Elves create a spectacle of monumental significance.  The mere scene of the amount of elves seems overwhelming!  It is hard to explain, but the view of the elves \\"en masse\\" as opposed to individuals adds a mystique to this film that makes Christmas itself seem more magical than it is normally presented.  Tom Hanks plays the train conductor who picks up the children who need to believe in Christmas again, or perhaps even for the first time.  He punches the childrens' tickets in the form of words that are customized to the needs of each child.  Eventually, the children are delivered back home with a new faith in Christmas.  True to it's unique flavor, the star child in the movie receives the \\"first gift of Christmas\\" which is a bell from Santa's sleigh.  Those who don't believe, cannot hear the bell, and believe it to be broken.  Those who believe, will never stop hearing the bell ring!  This film is a must, to complete your Christmas movie collection.  Wonderful for the entire family, to be watched year after year.    ---Damon Medic

B0042YHC38|1.0|This armband is awful I am surprised Adidas or Griffin would put their names on this thing.    First, it barely fits on my arm and I weigh 165 lbs and my arms are not huge.    Second, the material is thin and cheap and the flap on the top tore on day one.    Third, the plastic screen cover is cloudy and too small.    Fourth, it is uncomfortable.    Just a terrible product all around.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|I had been looking forward to seeing this movie since I enjoy suspense and thrillers but it did not qualify as either. I can't imagine why George Clooney wanted to produce this film much less star in it or what he thought the reaction of audiences to this non-story would be. The movie didn't hang together; the viewer can't develop empathy for Jack since he shows very little warmth and no redeeming human characteristics. The protagonist has no friends (one friend he did have he killed at the beginning of the film--- evidently because she witnessed him kill someone trying to kill him. According to this movie, prostitutes that \\"Jack\\" encounters are all young and beautiful and he doesn't need them to fake enjoyment since he is there \\"to be given pleasure, not to give it\\".  He portrays an unhappy, solitary, amoral sociopath who leads a miserable existence. There is very little dialogue and what dialogue is included is very confusing to follow.  The nudity and sex scenes were gratuitous and didn't seem to achieve anything other than to get an \\"R\\" rating to entice people who like seeing both frontal and backside female nudity and simulated sex to pay to see this film. Clooney should really refrain from showing his body without clothes on--he is very thin and his muscles are underdeveloped--certainly not the physique you would think George Clooney would have. I kept watching the film thinking it would get better and the story would finally make sense but it didn't. The film ended and I was left thinking I had wasted a perfectly good evening watching this bomb.  \\"He who lives by the sword, dies by the sword\\" is the moral to the story. The irony at the end is that when he has decided to quit this solitary criminal life and run off with a prostitute and start over, he is shot in a gun battle. Although he killed the other man, he dies too. You can't identify with the character and there's no sadness at his death.  There was no reason given the audience to like or care about thecharacter. This is a low-budget film with very few actors and it should never have been made. If I had known then what I know now, I would never have rented it. Wait for it to be shown free on television if you want to see it, don't waste your money renting or buying this DVD.  This is the second bomb Clooney has starred in recently; he needs to pick better material.
B00000IZOR|4.0|I didn't ask for this toy, but my 10 month old daughter received it as a gift for Christmas. She loves moving it around on the wheels, turning the rotary numbers (mostly for the sound it makes) and holding the receiver up to her ear. When I first saw the toy, the first thing I noticed was how ridiculously short the cord from the phone to the receiver is! I was a bit annoyed that they shortened it. BUT then I went into the basement of my parents house and found my old version of this toy and THE CORD ON THE OLD ONE IS THE SAME LENGTH! I was born in 1985, so maybe previous versions had longer cords, but a 25 year old version of it didn't. I think it's funny how we all assume that \\"parents today\\" were too worried about their kids strangling themselves on the cord, but apparently parents back then thought the same thing. I'm not sure how my daughter even knows what this is because she's never seen a phone like that before, but she still likes it! Long story short, my now 11 month old daughter still loves to play with this toy.
B004LRZ2YC|5.0|I watched the Swedish version first and it was good but there I think this version is much cleaner and the drama is more tight. The differences add to the experience of seeing the new version, rather than take away from the original. I loved the changes and the eliminating redundance such as him going to his father in the Swedish Version.    Good Movie to watch...even if you've seen the original!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Stating that this is one of the best books I've read in a long while is really saying something seeing as how I'm a voracious reader and am consistently happy with the books I order.  This book was exceptional though.  It's a historical/science mystery romance all wrapped into one.  First there is the protagonist Diana Bishop the last of the famous Bishop witches - her ancestor was burned at the stake in Salem.  Both her parents who were witches were killed when she was 7 years old and she grows up determined not to use her powers.  She gets her PhD in History and becomes a well known and respected professor.  During her summer at the Bodelain library in Oxford she comes across a very old manuscript which has been sealed by magic and she accidentally opens - this is a lot like opening Pandora's box because of all the creatures the opening of this text calls to Oxford.  Next meet Matthew Clairmont, a well respected scientist who also happens to be a vampire and he is doing his best to protect Diana from the daemons and witches who are out to get her because she opened up this old manuscript.  However Diana is head strong and doesn't know the danger she is in and attempts to get away from Matthew and the others.<br /><br />Eventually Matthew and Diana start having breakfast together or at least Diana eats while Matthew sips tea and then they go to a private yoga class which just happens to be on the estate Matthew owns.  Finally they are thrown together for good when a witch named Peter Knox threatens and then sends Diana a picture of her slain parents and she calls Matthew for help.  He quickly gets her out of the country and into France at his family estate where she meets his mother, who is a sworn enemy of all witches, and the housekeeper, also a vampire.  But alas they are not safe even in this fortress in France.  Diana is kidnapped and Matthew and his brother must attempt a rescue.  I won't tell you what happens but let's just say there are many more adventures along the way.  As far as the romance between Matthew and Diana is concerned, I thought it was very believeable and beautiful and I couldn't wait to get back to the book to find out how they were going to turn out.<br /><br />This is a wonderful thought provoking book with a beautiful romance written into it.  I certainly hope there will be another one after this one as the ending kind of leaves you hanging with what is happening to Matthew and Diana.  I would give this 6 stars if I could!the way.

B001853NZK|5.0|I bought this for my nephew's birthday and he really loved it.  was packaged pretty good . . . had a mark across the front where it was pushed against something else but over a day or two the mark went away and it was good as new.
B003Q6D1YW|1.0|I kept waiting for something to happen that I didn't expect, but it didn't happen.  I can't believe the word \\"thriller\\" was actually used.  In reality, it bored me to death.  I think the storyline was stolen from a Law and Order episode, which wasn't particularly thrilling either, but at least had a little drama.  The word \\"disappointment\\" is not strong enough.  You'd think the principles in this expect that everyone on the internet is exactly who they say they are.  In case you didn't figure it out, there's no guarantee anyone on the internet isn't making up everything they relate to you.
B0033QEQGW|3.0|This is a pretty good set of Mozart's string quartets. The musicianship is excellent. The recordings were made between 1963 though 1976 and there are some sonic anomalies. In particular the Andante in the E-flat major, K. 171. It is very muted. This might have been a 5 star review, but for that. Still, this a good collection of Mozart's string quartets and I do recommend these recordings.

B000209ZAE|4.0|Like the ease of setup and use of this drill stand. Several problems stand out. The vertical pole came loose after several uses, had to re-tighten the nut. Secondly, there is too much play such that accurate drilling is not possible. I could not figure out a way to get rid of the play or looseness of the stand when it holds the rotary instrument in place. The drill bit end moves at least 1-2 mm, which is quite a bit when working in small scale. That said I'm satisfied with my purchase. Also bought the Dremel brand drill stand, which had more plastic parts on it and made it feel \\"cheaper\\" than this stand. All in all this proxxon stand is more accurate and easier to use than the Dremel stand.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|The movie does not make it entirely clear as to who started this program, how many were involved, and why none of the unfortunate donors can ever strike out on their own and leave England altogether. (Perhaps they were being tracked via the microchips that set off the sensors?)<br /><br />However, the rest of the story is very sad, thought-provoking, and emotional without being syrupy or preachy at any point.  The three leads do a great job of showing the anguish of these ill-fated young people, whose sole purpose is to donate organs. (I am not spoiling anything--this info is on the back of the DVD box.)  Imagine what it would be like to be one of them and know that you are going to die before you turn 30 because of repeated donations.<br /><br />There is no reason for an R rating for this movie, incidentally.

B001IAOEXU|4.0|These clip on/snap on triggers for the PS3 (by Pelican) work well and are worth the money. At first they may the trigger buttons feel a little to high up and it may take you a little while to get used to it. But you should get used to them pretty quick. They snap on pretty good, but tend to fall off whenever i drop the controller. They're worth it though.
0618526412|3.0|Based on the good reviews and the subject matter I was expecting this to be a great read but in the end I can only give this book a lukewarm review. The age of the author is apparent to me when I read this book. The characters are not well rounded and the dialouge is lacking. The story takes awhile to move along and none of the characters ever seem to truely develop. I did like several of the characters and the writing style was nice enough. 3/5
B004DK49DW|5.0|At first listen I wasn't sure if this was what I was expecting from a Social D disc.  But after a couple of times around it really grew on me. Can't Take It With You sticks in my brain all day long.  Kind of like I Was Wrong did many years ago.  \\"Never see a hearse with a luggage rack\\".  Great lyrics.  Play it loud, play it proud.  Machine Gun Blues, another SD classic. This is really good stuff, just a bit different than their past releases.  All bands have to evolve a bit or they get stale.  Social D still rocks!  This disc is in heavy rotation in my system. BUY IT!

B002VECM6S|1.0|I have to agree with some of the 1 star reviewers on this one. Even though  it's supposedly a true story, Sandra Bullock gives a one-note performance, as somebody  else commented, and it's hard to believe she won a best actress Oscar for this. The characters in  the film seem to be one-dimensional or two dimensional. Seemed like a TV \\"feel good\\" film.  The real-life story couldn't be as \\"schmaltzy\\" and simplistic as this movie, I'd guess.  I haven't read the book, I admit. But as a movie, it's bad, in my opinion.  If you loved it,  good for you. I can't change your mind, and you won't be able to change mine.  For those who haven't seen this film, I'd suggest renting it before buying it.  Sandra Bullock has been good in a few films, but this performance didn't deserve a best actress  award - sorry to repeat myself.

B0006GAI6Y|4.0|It's a quiet Saturday afternoon and I was going through some DVDs to take to a friend who is fighting breast cancer.  She requested some with no violence and I know she doesn't like bad language or graphic sex.  I ran across this one, not even sure of how it made it into my collection.  It was still sealed.  Not wanting to take it to her and find out it was offensive, I decided now was a good time to watch it.<br /><br />This isn't an academy award winning piece of work, but it was an enjoyable way to spend the afternoon.  It was your basic Richard Gere/Jennifer Lopez romantic comedy.  I didn't realize Stanley Tucci was in it, or I might have watched it sooner.  He is one of my favorite character actors.  I first became aware of him in [[ASIN:B000089736 Undercover Blues]], which will always be an all-time favorite because of him.  He did not disappoint.  I was also pleased that there was nothing offensive in the movie (there were a total of 2 four-letter words, spoken by Stanley Tucci's character).  I would feel comfortable watching this movie with my children present (although they probably wouldn't like it) or even my parents.  Anyone who enjoys chick-flicks will enjoy this movie.
B004NFB4EO|5.0|People keep crying over how unoriginal this song is, but it is my opinion that Lady Gaga was giving a nod to all the songs you hear mashed up in BTW. She's taking the music I heard growing up and giving it to a new generation of music lovers. This song is campy, yes, but nothing feels better than screaming out the lyrics along with the track; it's empowering, it's exciting, it's Lady Gaga.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Remembering how much I enjoyed Toy Story when it first came out, I imagined that it would be something my son would enjoy just as much.  He's only a toddler but he already knows all the characters in the movie, and of course, he wants to watch it all the time now (which I don't allow him to do--haha.)    The Blu Ray transfer of the movie is fantastic!  Everything looks crisp and clear on our 50\\" Panasonic 1080p HDTV, and the sound is high caliber as well.  That's important because Toy Story has a great soundtrack composed by Randy Newman--an integral part of the movie.  There are lots of special features worth watching as well.  I appreciate these 2-disc Blu Ray + DVD combination packs because, well, who wants to buy another Blu Ray player for the other room?  Having the companion DVD is a nice luxury and Toy Story looks great on DVD as well.  Thanks Amazon for having a great price on the package.

B00328G4V6|4.0|All the complaining about this release that I've been reading is pretty absurd. Even if this actually WAS a cynical ploy to milk money from fans with sub-par material, this is JIMI HENDRIX. Everyone who releases music would like it to sell and make money and this one is no different. C'mon people. It's always worth hearing Hendrix play guitar, whether it's an alternate version of a well-known song, a studio outtake, a rehearsal or even just noodling around. This is likely the greatest guitar player who's ever lived and ever will. Think Hendrix was a perfectionist who never would've allowed these songs to see the light of day? Well, maybe he'd feel differently now that he's gone but we'll never know will we?<br /><br />To be sure, he DID strive to achieve perfection and he was never completely satisfied, particularly with his first two albums. But they were released anyways and we can all be grateful for that. The public demand to hear what's in the vaults exists for a good reason - even if it doesn't measure up to his best work, this music is well worth hearing.<br /><br />Breakdown:<br /><br />\\"Stone Free\\" - This is the first original song Jimi wrote for the Experience and it was used on the B-side of his first single, \\"Hey Joe\\". The version presented here is arguably better than the original release. It's funkier - the drums have more swing, the guitars are more energetic and the guitar solo is scorching. New bassist Billy Cox replaces Noel Redding and greatly improves the bass lines with dexterity and added muscle. The whole song is more organic. The only minor drawback is the ending where the song loses its momentum and becomes a bit repetitive. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Valleys of Neptune\\" - This song was still a work in progress before Jimi's untimely death, but you wouldn't necessarily know that just from listening to it. The guitar parts exemplify the sophisticated direction Hendrix was heading toward in 1969 and the song itself is gorgeous. ****<br /><br />\\"Bleeding Heart\\" - Jimi covers an old song from blues guru and Hendrix influence Elmore James. It's a bit rough, particularly the vocals, but it's quite spirited and Jimi's guitar is on fire. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Hear My Train A-Coming\\" - is a classic blues penned by Hendrix. According to the liner notes, this version was recorded live in the studio in just one take. It definitely has a loose, jam session feel to it. Fantastic! *****<br /><br />\\"Mr. Bad Luck\\" - This is the earliest recorded track of the bunch - 1967. It was made during the AXIS:BOLD AS LOVE sessions and was understandably discarded although it's still a good song. It's a straight-up rocker that any fan of Hendrix's guitar playing should appreciate. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Sunshine of Your Love\\" - This is a very solid instrumental version of the classic Cream song, using the arrangement created by The Experience for the stage. It's not the best version I've heard, but it's virtually flawless and Hendrix still blows Clapton out of the water. The middle of the song gets quiet and subdued which isn't exactly engaging, but it allows the band to build up to a climax before once again launching into that classic riff. ****1/4<br /><br />\\"Lover Man\\" - is derived from BB King's \\"Rock Me Baby,\\" a song Hendrix positively TORE UP at the famous Monterrey Pop Festival. This track, to my mind, is only notable for Hendrix's guitar playing. Quite frankly, I got tired of this standard 12-bar blues chord progression ages ago, but it's worth hearing in the hands of a guitarist as great as Hendrix is. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Ships Passing Through The Night\\" - a song that's a little off the beaten path, kinda funky with angular guitar figures. As always, it's all about Hendrix's guitar and there's an unusual little guitar freak out at the end of the song. Recorded in 1969, this is another track that highlights the way he was playing towards the end of his life, especially on \\"Night Bird Flying\\" which this song resembles in certain ways.****<br /><br />\\"Fire\\" - Recorded in 1969, this is a well done if not particularly remarkable blast through the ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? classic from 1967, save for the red hot Hendrix solo. It's looser than the album version, thanks especially to the confident, swinging and colorful playing of drummer Mitch Mitchell in a style he developed in live settings. ****<br /><br />\\"Red House\\" - a fine, extended reading of Hendrix's classic blues original. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"Lullaby for the Summer\\" - is a cool, rangey instrumental that would eventually evolve into \\"Ezy Rider.\\" Stands as a unique piece of studio experimentation. ***1/2<br /><br />\\"Crying Blue Rain\\" - begins as a soulful instrumental that picks up the pace towards the end of the song. Yet another studio experiment off the beaten path, worth hearing for anyone who loves Hendrix. ****e ARE YOU EXPERIENCED? classic from 1967, save for the red hot Hendrix solo.

B0041KKYEM|4.0|Natalie Portman is one of those stars who has been with us since she was a child.  The usual scenario is that these child actors are history the minute they become adults.  Some of them, for one, were cute children and are not especially attractive adults yet they are caught in an image business.  Natalie Portman did not have this problem.  She grew into a beautiful woman with her acting skills finely honed as she came into adulthood.  She also studied ballet until she was 12 so this role was especially well suited for her.  I think she may well get the Oscar for it because she is able to inhabit both parts of the swan from Swan Lake, the ballet. When we first meet her she is the virginal, pristine, rigid princess type white swan.  The black swan is the evil swan so she has to bring out a whole other side of herself in order to dance the black swan.  Her sequences onstage as the black swan are some of the very best in the entire film.<br /><br />The plot is very simple and hinges entirely on the Natalie Portman swans.  It is that she starts cracking up as she pushes herself to become both swans.  This going nuts aspect of the movie is a bit over the top. I almost would have preferred a supernatural basis to her becoming the black swan. As we hurtle towards the ending, I'm reminded of the all time weeper of ballet movies, \\"The Red Shoes.\\" This is not a weeper like that film but they both deal with the passion and obsession of the dance over the dancer.<br /><br />I've always liked Darren Aronofsky's work and this film is no exception. One warning: if you hate ballet, this movie may not be for you.  There are very few moments in the movie where there isn't some aspect of ballet going on.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the most awesome show ever to grace the airwaves.  Damn those executives that canceled it in the first season for being too original!  You can watch the movie before you see the show but I don't recommend it.  Both the movie \\"Serenity\\" and the show \\"Firefly\\" should be in every sci-fi fans dvd collection!    Screw Captian Kirk AND Captain Picard.....Captain Mal is the BEST CAPTAIN EVER!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is fantastic! Right from the beginning I knew that this book was a good book. There is something special about this book that makes me not want to put it down.It is one of the best books I have ever read.Seriously, it is a very good book.  ~ Kaylia McIntyre
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After the morons at Fox canceled \\"Firefly\\" (The best tv show EVER) the outrage of the fans resulted in this film which answers 1 of the many questions the end of the TV series leaves you with.  I continue to hope against hope that we will see one more Serenity film to get the closure all of us browncoats are dying for.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This video kicked my butt! It works but only if you give it your all and do it at least every other day. Jillian works you hard, but she gets you into shape!
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I gave this one 5 stars even though the first few times I listened to it I was less than impressed.  If your looking for Demon Days 2, sorry, you'll not find it in these tracks.  Plastic Beach has it's own sound.  After about 3 or 4 times listening to the album I let go of my Demon Days expectations and began to really enjoy this album for it's own unique qualities.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|it was one of the best books i have ever read! i thought collins gregor series was great, and now she brings out this? utterly amazing.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Absolutely LOVED the video.  Jillian really works you hard.  I just completed 29/30 days today and have seen and felt a tremendous difference.  This is the first exercise video I have actually carried through on.  I loved the different levels and variety of exercises.  Well worth your money and time.
B0049OSQ18|5.0|The Decemberists are the greatest band in America today, IMHO.  This album has less of the full sound evidenced on their last concept album, \\"The Hazards of Love\\".  \\"The King is Dead\\" is clever and catchy, and it consciously shows American bluegrass and folkrock roots.  Peter Buck of REM and Gillian Welch of bluegrass fame play on the album, and Sarah Wadkins of Nickel Creek has joined the Decemberists on their current tour;  I saw them in New York and loved the show.  This record is definitely American;  it is also just plain fun.  It is good enough that you can play it over and over and not get tired of it.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|I'm not sure what it says about me but \\"The Professional\\" is one of my favorite movies. I'm ashamed to admit that I didn't know there was an extended/European version till now. The \\"extra\\" footage does an excelent job of providing more back story and character development. The extra Mathilda materiel changes the whole movie.
1932907009|5.0|I found this book amazing,  so I was surprised to see a few low ratings on it. I clicked out of morbid curiosity, and the two I read made me wonder--did they even read the book?<br /><br />One complains that Snyder was a \\"loser\\" who didn't write any good movies. Another griped that the book promises to make you a multi-million-dollar scriptwriter. Neither contained any mention of what's inside the book.<br /><br />What's inside the book is a fun read and a wealth of understanding. I've read a lot of writing books, and there are few I've read more than once. I've read this one three times, and I'll read it again.<br /><br />The beat sheet along with its explanation, some thirty pages of the book, is worth the price of this book and more. Of course Snyder gives more than that, and hence I rate this book five stars.<br /><br />Most structure books either bore or confuse me, and some do a great job of both. Snyder writes as if I didn't spend the last ten years studying writing and scripts in a college program. As an alumnus of only the school of hard knocks, I appreciate it.<br /><br />[...]
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|this is most definitely the best book i have ever read. when you start reading you are truely sucked into the life of a young girl named katniss everdeen who lives in district 12. once again amazing
B0000844I8|5.0|Who the heck wrote the editorial review for Amazon?? Whoever it is, they sure don't know much about movies! \\"Hokey\\"? \\"Senseless\\"? Obviously, not only is the reviewer no lover of science fiction, but he, she, or it has no knowledge of current science whatsoever! Listen, this is one of the best movies I've ever bought. You could do worse by latching onto \\"The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane.\\"    Laugh that one off, Amazon Reviewer!
0060776579|5.0|I have been introduced to many motivational and self improvement authors, but this is the one. I connected to this more than any other book or CD I've ever read.  I listen to it and do the affirmations daily. I have had it for one month and I feel differently, thinking differently and I truly feel more positive than I had prior to listening to the CD.  If you want to think like a Millionare and know how to self evaluate. This is the CD. Buy it now!
B004AHNIGM|5.0|Even after all the tough times he's endured, Gregg can still bring it!  Floating Bridge is one of my all-time favorite blues songs, and this was a great cover.  Just Another Rider was easily the best song on the album, though.  JAR is further proof that Warren Haynes is an incredible songwriter.  Doyle Bramhall II's presence on guitar was great, as well.  I would highly recommend this product to any ABB, dTb, Gov't Mule fan.  Buy it!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|It's a necesary material to understand and appreciate Cameron's and all his crew work. The history is complemented whith the deleted scenes. And the box set is A m a z i n g!
B000002A3T|1.0|The music on TDB is perfect for the grocery store. It's smooth, generic pop music that evokes sensations of cellophane and artificial flowers and bright shiny linoleum floors and cold steel buggies. It really fits in well with our society, I think.  I gave it a low rating, though, because I was expecting to hear the Pink Floyd.  But now that I think about it, TDB may be a Gilmour/Mason/Wright excursion into postmodern irony.  On that level, it certainly succeeds. Okay, I get it now.  Well done, guys!
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|I have to say - I only watched this movie because it had Greg Kinnear in it. It turned out to be a nice little movie - a couple things were a bit hard to believe (the kids finishing the stained glass window for instance) but overall a nice family movie.    Miley Cyrus has a bit of way to go as an actress - but she did pretty well. But the male leads in the movie were just outstanding! Greg Kinnear turned in an elegant, understated performance and Liam Hemsworth and Bobby Coleman lit up the screen (can't wait for more from these two!). Sorry, but Kelly Preston just is so incredibly boring to watch, she was the negative here for me.
B003WWZ1R0|3.0|This music CD wasn't exactly what I was expecting.  The music is good, it was just not the music I was looking for.
0439023513|3.0|I'll try to brief since I see how in-depth the surrounding reviews are. I enjoyed the first two books, especially the first. I found it engaging, interesting and an easy read.  However the general consensus of the people who had a problem with book 3 are right on target.  It's as if Katniss takes a back seat to the bigger picture and never truly takes control of her own path. Major plot points, major characters and major issues are concluded rather abruptly and without the in depth feel of the rest of the novel(s). There is far too much time spent sleeping, drugged up and recovering in the hospital, hiding or alone in a dark room thinking and I, as a reader began to feel cheated out of a satisfying ending.  I would suggest fans of the first two give it a try but don't let your high expectations of Katniss get in the way.
B004CLYKLI|4.0|My father recommended this book to me. We always have discussions about the education of our oldest son. He always things that I should be stricter, while I think it is not appropriate for my son. (My youngest son I do apply the stricter style and that works)     This book confirms for me that even for a very \\"Chinese\\" mother \\"submission\\" is not always possible. Each child is an individual and should be treated accordingly. I recognise myself as the Western parent, who thinks confidence is important etc.. But I also think it is ridiculous if a child is praised for acting normal. What I take away from the book is the insight that it is good though to have ambition for a child, that a child can grow from a \\"critical\\" attitude, that it learns to prioritise, and it is proper to show respect.    The book read like a train. It was very extreme (humoristic for the reader, not the daughters), but Mrs Chua realised this, and this made it entertaining. The book ended rather abruptly...I would love to know how the daughters view their mother in say 10 to 15 years, when they are a mother themselves.
1439153663|1.0|I have to tell you I hated this book and half way through I realized I had already read it.  I finished it, reluctantly, and then was told they changed the selection for the book club without telling me.  I would not recommend this book.
0786856297|1.0|I hated this book. I have read many fantasy books and this was the worst of all. I would have given it a 0 star if that was possible. I thought the story was totally predictable, the descriptions were not up to the standard I would expect from a published book (more like an amateur school assignment). The characters did not have any depth and some of the main characters are obviously influenced by Harry Potter series. So in all a book where I did not like the basic story or descriptions or characters, hence nothing good about this book.
B0036S4CTS|1.0|The premise of this book sounds like it would be enjoyable. I cannot seem to find a reason to go from year to year with these characters. I do not find any character remotely likable, nor do I care what happens to them. I have re-read chapters to try and find a plot, but it keeps eluding me. I hate to give up on a book and kept reading hoping something would \\"grab\\" my interest. The chapters seem to be short stories on their own except there is no start and  finish, one chapter does not lead into the next.   There is nothing that makes me want to find out how this ends so I will quite at 80% read. Glad I did not pay 12.99 for it!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Superbowl, Schmuperbowl - while everyone else was watching the game, I kicked back with \\"Elena Undone.\\" I totally understand all of the awards - great film!! Captivating story, completely believable characters.  Beautifully acted, directed, filmed, and scored. Music supervision was outstanding - you will definitely want to pick up the soundtrack too!  Looking forward to Nicole Conn's next big project, \\"A Perfect Ending\\"...
031603438X|5.0|This book reads a lot like you're sitting down and listening to Keith jam on the guitar.  He floats from idea to idea, as though he's searching for a riff.  Then he latches on to something and tells a story or two, followed by more - somewhat random - thoughts.  It took me a while to grasp his style, but once I got it, I was hooked.    Yes, Keith Richards does talk about drugs and the influence it had on his life and the lives of those around him.  However, this book is not dominated by drug stories.  Richards provides a ton of interesting details about his life, including the evolution of The Rolling Stones, his relationship with his family and the other members of the band, and even briefly touches on some of the guitar techniques and modifications that make his sound unique.    There is plenty to learn from this book.  For example, many of us know that The Rolling Stones were heavily influenced by Chicago Blues.  However, it was news to me that the Stones didn't originally intend to become a global rock and roll sensation.  They didn't even write their own songs at first.  They just wanted to be the best blues cover band in London.    Life is an interesting read that does a great job of demonstrating that Keith Richards is so much more than a rock and roll star and a junkie.
0061367036|5.0|Hi to all the Supernatural fans,The Supernatural Book Of Monsters,Spirits,Demons,and Ghouls is a great read and if you believe in anything Supernatural in reality,this a great book if in reality you happen to come up against anything remotely Supernatural because this book is the key to defeating everything Supernatural.I would highly recommend it to all the fans of Supernatural.
B003EYVXUU|4.0|It's rare that a remake equals the original but whether or not you're more of a fan of the original movie \\"Let The Right One In\\" or the remake, both films offer a unique creepy film about Owen (Kodi Smit-McPhee from \\"The Road\\")who finds himself bullied, alienated from his peers and his own family as he is caught in the crossfire of divorce. He befriends a new girl named Abby (Chloe Grace Moretz in a marvelous performance)who is a vampire and while Owen suspects something is off with the girl he bonds with her immediately inspite of the hositility of her \\"father\\" (Richard Jenkins of \\"The Visitor\\" and \\"Six Feet Under\\" fame). There's not a huge deviation in the basic plot but the interpretation and portrayal of the characters brings a different element to the story.<br /><br />Perfectly cast, \\"Let Me In\\" captures the odd vibe of the original film while adding its own textures. Director Matt Reeves in adapting the novel and original screenplay turns the story some what on its head by telling it in flashback form. Set during the certainty of the Reagan presidency in the 1980's, \\"Let Me In\\" also nicely captures the atmosphere of innocence and cynicism that existed pre-9/11.<br /><br />\\"Let Me In\\" is a nice return to form of former horror stalwart Hammer Films.

Where the image is soft it was an intentional choice and, for the most part, the images are crystal clear and sharp as a vampire's tooth.<br /><br />There are also some really cool extras for fans who like those sort of things including a commentary by director Reeves who doesn't shy away from discussing the marvelous original film.

B002SOFAE2|5.0|[[ASIN:B001A2ADGS Hysteria [Vinyl]]]    Hysteria is just one of those albums, you put it on and their is not a skippable song on the record. I own the CD and the vinyl of this record. The vinyl gives you more of a atmosphere but the CD is just produced to a T. One of the best produced, written and performed albums in the history of music. It was well worth the 4 plus years it took to make the record. Truly some epic songs with Gods of War, Hysteria and Pour Some Sugar On Me at the top of the class in rock music.

B003Z2LAAO|3.0|My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.<br /><br />Not counting a few shallow effects, there are 11 out of screen effects. 4 that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer and another 3 around 25%. Bubbles float around extending up to 50% for 90 seconds. Grinding sparks shoot out for 15 seconds up to 50%. A fishing net hangs out 35% for 15 seconds and there is a floating window at about 20%. The effects in the menu are also very nice.<br /><br />No real complaints about the in screen 3D. Most of the footage is clear and excess parallax only showed itself a few times.<br /><br />*** Nice scenery and wild river shots ***<br />*** The bubbles floating around in mid air are pretty cool ***<br /><br />MY 3D RATING = GOOD (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)<br /><br />Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%.

1594488843|5.0|Couldn't resist the title Daniel, but of course your book has nothing to do with the movie Driving Miss Daisy.<br /><br />What is does have is four decades of research to explore the gap between what science knows...and what business thinks about motivation. It is full of case studies of companies who are motivating well--and those who are not--and provides a welcome road map for leaders looking to learn more about what motivates not only employees, but also themselves.<br /><br />We are a society that motivates itself based on external factors--money, fame, glory--but is that really the most effective motivation? Those of us who have been in business for many years know that those external motivators can only take you so far (usually that's not very far).<br /><br />Interesting Daniel!<br /><br />Stefan Swanepoel<br />Author: [[ASIN:0470947802 Surviving Your Serengeti: 7 Skills to Master Business and Life]]

193413712X|5.0|This novel focuses primarily on George Washington Crosby and his father and the recollection of their experiences. As the book opens, George is dying but the narrative alternates between his life and that of his father, a man who had epileptic fits. Although the events described may seem to be relatively minor, not major episodes in history, the details makes this book a standout. Because of the relatively short length, it would be a perfect choice for the type of book club which focuses on novels which aren't light and easy. It is well worth discussing.<br /><br />It is important to keep up with the varying episodes which jump through time, going back and forth, not always in chronological order. But don't worry. This isn't as confusing as you might think. You're likely to be struck by the rich characterizations - particularly those of George and  Howard Crosby (Howard is the tinker in the family, repairing tin and copper pots and more). But you're also apt to be drawn into the portrayals of minor characters as well, from the local doctor to the father of George's friend, Ray Morrell. Then there is George's mother, a woman noted as having \\"a contrary heart.\\"<br /><br />I'd urge you to take time to savor the way the descriptions of the natural world in Tinkers.  They make up so much of the novel and I was taken by how the beginning of the book focused partly on George's sense of losing himself in the \\"blue of the sky\\" and the stars, \\"the ornaments of heaven shaken loose.\\" The transitions from day into night - and vice versa- are told in lush and lovely prose. Don't rush over these sections. This is a worthy addition to the list of Pulitzer prize winners, primarily for the way Howard and George Crosy - and those around them - capture the imagination and leave behind a sense of a world entire, beautifully written, with no spare words.

0385523912|5.0|Much has been written about North Korea and the politics of the odious Kim dynasty.  But if you want to get a real flavor of what life is like for the \\"ordinary person\\" there, you won't find a better English-language read than this.
B003DZX44I|5.0|In this Oscar season for Toy Story 3, it is well to remember that Beauty and the Beast (as is repeatedly mentioned in the extra features) was the first animated film to be nominated for Best Picture (and it won the Golden Globe for musical/comedy).  It was well deserving!  There are no weaknesses in this movie: The songs are the best in any Disney film (and who'dve thunk, considering the two most important songs are sung by Angela Lansbury and Jerry Orbach....), the voice acting is great, the animation is astonishing (especially for its time).  Sure there are occasional weird, off-model moments, but not nearly as in Little Mermaid (and you get the feeling they may even be deliberate, e.g. when Gaston is flexing in the pub).  Certainly, this is the best pre-Pixar Disney film for animation, and although I have a soft spot in my heart for Ariel, Mulan, Aurora, et al., Belle is clearly the greatest of the Disney Princesses - plucky, great voice, brave, and looks better in a ballroom than even Cinderella in her Fairy-Godmother-enhanced dress.  Granted, Cinderella had to stand next to Prince Charming, whereas Belle's comparison is the \\"horrible, hideous Beast!\\"    The story, in short (spoiler alert! - but as in most musicals, the plot is not really the point) - Belle's father (Maurice) seeks shelter from a wolf attack in a strange castle, inhabited by enchanted objects - Lumiere the candlestick, Cogsworth the clock, Mrs. Potts the teapot, etc.  The castle had been enchanted because the master of the castle, now an enormous, angry beast, was unkind and treated a disguised enchantress badly.  Belle finds Maurice in the castle, sick and dying in the dungeon, and trades her life for her father's.  Through the help of the servants (the enchanted objects), Beast and Belle learn to live together and even to enjoy each others' company.  Meanwhile, Gaston, the local narcisistic bully has decided he will do anything to marry Belle (\\"In town there's only she/Who is beautiful as me/So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle\\").  Ultimately Gaston and the Beast do battle, and Belle's love redeems the Beast and breaks the enchantment.    Thus, on the surface, this is a standard Disney adventure, good vs. evil, seen in everything before it from Snow White to The Little Mermaid.  However, there are a few key points that make this film rise above all the others.  First is the quality of the songs, and their integration in the plot.  They are catchy tunes but also efficient storytellers, especially the \\"Something There\\" montage that shows Beast and Belle turning from a state of mutual dislike to one of friendship.  There is also a clear redemption story parallelling the good-vs.-evil story, which is rare in Disney films (only Ratatouille, the Lion King, and Cars have such an integration of a redemption story, and of those only Lion King can compete with Beauty and the Beast for sheer emotional effectiveness).  The third key is Belle herself - she is a true hero and makes her own happy ending.  Let us compare her to the other classic Disney Princesses: Aurora is never given the opportunity for heroism and is simply rescued by Prince Philip, Cinderella suffers much but has given up to dispair when the Fairy Godmother finally appears to rescue her, Ariel selfishly and foolishly jeopardizes her own life and her father's kingdom, etc.  Snow White does bravely pull herself together and rescues herself when cast out by the Queen, but she then naively allows herself to get poisoned (and again a Prince needs to rescue her).  Only Mulan shows a degree of moral fortitude similar to Belle when she, too, saves her incapacitated father's life by taking his place (but, as pointed out in another Amazon review, who remembers any of the songs in Mulan?).    So, given that you simply MUST buy this film, the question becomes Blu-ray or DVD-only?  (in these Diamond editions, the Blu-ray also comes with the DVD)  I'm not sure which of these extras are included in the DVD-only version, but the full suite of Blu-ray extras are impressive (second only to the greatest Blu-ray I've ever seen, which is Snow White).  There are many many extras detailing the making of the film (and of the spin-off Broadway musical).  Of particular interest to me is the degree to which this is actually Howard Ashman's film.  Sure, he is listed as Executive Producer, but that could mean anything.  In this case, it appears he exterted the kind of control that, say, George Lucas did in Return of the Jedi.  He even ruthlessly cut one of his own songs when it wasn't working and replaced it with \\"Something More\\".  The excised song - \\"Human Again\\" - is seamlessly re-integrated into this Blu-ray (you can watch the \\"Original Theatrical Version\\" or the \\"Extended Version\\" which includes the new song).  It's fully animated and (since it was recorded before it was cut) contains the original voice actors' singing.  There is the original 20-minute \\"treatment\\" that was shown to Katzenberger and the other Disney executives (which led to a change in the creative leadership of the film)  Finally, like in Snow White, several extra animated shorts from Walt Disney himself are included - two Silly Symphonies and four Laugh-o-Gram fairytales (including a 7-minute Cinderella).  Unfortunately, it is difficult to find some of these special features as they are buried under multiple menus of non-intuitive location.  Even more frustrating (indeed, almost enraging) are the Blu-ray technical issues that have plagued every Disney Blu-ray yet produced: there is no \\"resume play\\" feature - if you stop half-way through you can't re-start from where you stopped, you even have to watch the anti-piracy warnings again.  You cannot even fast-search through the special features!  Are you telling me that my $30 Walmart DVD player has these features but my $400 Sony-built PS3 does not?  Even my old VCR  from 1980 could fast-search....  Exactly when will Blu-ray technology manage to be able to do the same technical things that were common 30 years ago?
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|The Concert for Bangladesh film is extraordinary, and the DVD version is quite excellent. The sound quality is superb, with great mixing and balance. The video quality is also high. The performances are outstanding. George Harrison is great, calm and resolute though somewhat serious and humble. I think he felt this befitting the seriousness and gravity of the situation that inspired this first rock benefit concert. The other stars also have a somewhat serious approach, except for the delightful performance by Billy Preston (who can hardly contain his joy and enthusiasm!). Bob Dylan's voice is great. He looks very young as he performs some of his most famous early pieces. Clapton plays very well in a supporting role and does not seek the spotlight.    The bonus material is very good. The duet by Harrison and Dylan is a great. Interesting insights into the production of the film, and other documentary info.    Highly recommended!
B000Q66HBE|4.0|BFMV is simply awesome. I would've given this five stars except that I reserve five stars for CD's that I like every song on. There are a couple on here that I'm not all that crazy about. Tears Don't Fall, All These Things I hate, Cries in Vain, and 10 Years Ago are the must hear songs on the album. The deluxe edition has extra tracks that are well worth it. The remake of Metallica's Welcome Home is wonderful and the acoustic version of Tears Don't Fall is a great edition. The bonus DVD has live concert footage as well as music videos. Definitely worth the $6 or so it's running on amazon used right now. I believe the regular edition is running about the same price so why not grab this one?
B003PIUC02|5.0|I love this show, was a bit frighten by the pilot somehow but the last 10 min sold it!! The rest of the show is awesome, but not for the faint of heart!!!  Blu ray bonuses are ok though they could have gone deeper into the training, fight choreography preparations and a documentary in the real spartacus.  I do recommend this set if you watched it on Starz!!!
B003OF3R0S|4.0|I fell in love with one of the songs on this cd and decided then I wanted it. When I found it on here for the price I got I was shocked. I bought it and have been happy ever since. This cd is really good. Hard songs mixed with soft ones just to make the cd more enjoyable.
B003Q6D25K|5.0|An excellent prequel to Paranormal Activity. I loved the first movie and I loved the second! Paranormal Activity 2 keeps the audience focused and scared throughout, while the first (which is still very good) keeps the audience bored at times and not very scared, til the ending. Paranormal Activity has more characters and somewhat bigger budget (than the first) with low-budget actors. The sequel is good and keeps you entertained. And for the low price you can get it at, it's defiantly worth buying!
142314189X|5.0|I purchased the boxed set for my grandson who is 12. He is an excellent reader who has a tough time getting enough books he hasn't read. This set was perfect for him. He enjoys the stories and it is his first complete set which he has owned. The stories kept his interest and he was able to enjoy each of them. Finding books that appeal to boys of this age which are not extremely violent is difficult. This set has enough action to keep him interested.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|A very good horror movie. I liked the original version of the movie. But I loved the American version, I liked it better and it was just really good. The stuck to the original story and kept the scene very similar (except for a few exceptions). The movie was enjoyable and good. The child actors where excellent actors. The movie is scary-sad and overall great! It will be a classic like the original.<br />The DVD includes a comic (In select packaging) and a see-through slipcover.
B003SWNRU2|3.0|Beat the bastards, Teutonic Terror, Blood of Nations, Locked and Loaded, Rolling Thunder, No Shelter & Bucket full of Hate are worthy of an MP3 download. The rest of the songs are just filler.    Production is good. Solos are great. Singing is very good. It's just a lot of the rhythmic guitar parts are on the basic/simplistic/generic side. Some of the transitions are a little awkward, like after the guitar solo when it leads back to the last chrous. Drums are there, but no Neil Peart.
B0037QGS0A|5.0|Chloe... An excellent & haunting movie. I love it. It is an odd movie. It has a great cast and really enjoyable. I loved the plot. It has good soundtrack and the movie is by far one of the bests of 2010. It was really good. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It's kind of like a Lifetime movie, but dirtier. This movie will be on the LMN (lifetime movie network), but it won't be the same without it's explicit (but fits into the story) language and scenes. It's a must buy.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've been looking for the right, compact headphones to wear around the city that won't sit like two bricks on my ears. I can't wear buds due to the shape of my ear holes, but I still wanted them to be inconspicuous. They are also practically unbreakable because the headband is incredibly stretchy.
B004D7GU3C|5.0|Ricky has done it again ... evolved, found new sounds and amazing drums.  Awesome album.  Get the bonus CD on the Target version if you can.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|This film is pure cinema. A computer world come to life with stunning visual effects, a pulse-pounding soundtrack, and inventive action scenes that get your blood pumping. The acting is decent -the standouts being Jeff Bridges \\"Dude-like\\" reinterpretation of Kevin Flynn, Michael Sheen as the Ziggy Stardust wannabe Castor, and Olivia Wilde who burns up the screen with her huge-anime inspired eyes, leather outfit, and Dora meets punk rock hairdo. Very entertaining film that will surely push the boundaries of what blu ray can do at home.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|this is my fav book in the world! i literally couldnt put it down! i could read it all day only stopping to eat (but i probably wouldnt even stop 2 eat i probably would read it when i wuz eatin) and still b entertained. ive been tellin every1 2 read it and it wuz published on my bday. ya i thought it wuz cool my fav book wuz published on my bday, april 28! im definetly goin 2 get the nxt book in the series. well basically itz like percy jackson kinda but itz with egyptian gods. personally it wuz soooo much better than percy jackson.  sadie and carter find out theyre hostin gods and they try 2 defeat the evil god set but itz just sooo good. i think every1 could read it like kids and adults so ya byeee and read this book  xcept theres like 272 comments bfore mine soo u probably wnt read this and really IGNORE ANY BAD COMMENTZ even tho thre will probably not b any cuz it soo good
B003L20ICE|4.0|I loved the cast, but I thought this was going to be a comedy, or at least a light hearted movie.  I was not prepared by the commercials for what I saw.  Great cast and the acting was superb.
B001BANK32|5.0|This novel was a real treat.  I read Stephen King's \\"On Writing\\", and it made me want to read one of his novels.  I had not read one of his books since Junior High.  The Shining did not disappoint.  Stephen King really knows how to get inside a character's head, especially when that character has a murderous dark side.  One of the things I really liked about his character development is that he makes the characters seem real; but he just takes those dark thoughts normal people have one step further into the abyss.  I actually had nightmares while I was reading this book; finding myself staring my mortality in the face, etc...; if a novel has that kind of effect on me, it gets five stars in my book.    After I read the book, I went ahead and watched the movie our of curiosity.  The movie pales in comparison to the book; isn't that normally the case?  The depth of character is just not in the movie.
0670022411|5.0|First of all, I feel really bad for the author that the book has three stars here because of the Kindle edition being $15. The cost of the actual printing of the book is not that much. What you pay for when you buy the book is all the people who earn a living making these stories available. And authors do not get rich on writing these books. If the author is very, very lucky they may make $30K over the course of a successful book unless they are Stephen King or sell the movie rights.    As for the story, it isn't easy to put a different spin on the whole vampire / witch / human storyline. Kim Harrison has done it quite nicely as has Patricia Briggs with werewolves. The author has done a marvelous job blending the paranormal with political intrigue and complex characters along with fascinating aspects of history.     I can't wait for the sequel!
B001BL4RAG|5.0|Coldplay is a great group and they make the most beautiful music. What can I say I love music and so I no Great Music when I hear and Coldplay epitomizes Great Music. Viva La vida!!!
0345505387|1.0|I gave this book one star because I decided they should get some credit for getting the names of the characters right.  If you loved the Outlander series, this book has nothing of what you loved: the depth of the characters, the intriguing and compelling plot, the suspense, the feeling that the main characters' relationship was unique and special. If you never read the series or the first book, you won't really get the story because The Exile is so disjointed. It also has an extraneous character that wasn't even in Outlander. I found it insulting because I have bought and read the entire series and I was suckered into this because I thought if Gabaldon's name was on it, it was going to be good...VERY GOOD.  I was wrong. Don't waste your money on thin characters, weird artwork and a chopped up attempt at reproducing a piece of quality entertainment.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|I found The xx 2 days ago. I've heard of them for a while but I've never listened to them. I'm glad I recently did, because I am in L O V E with The xx. Reviews from this album might say it's \\"dull\\", \\"bland\\", and \\"boring\\", but they really need to LISTEN to this album. This is, in my opinion, a really heartfelt album. And it might take a few listens to realize that, but it'll be worth it. Amazing.<br /><br />-:)
B000066AXE|5.0|Someone suggested I see this movie, Russell Crowe had not been one of favorite actors, but he did an outstanding job of John Nash, great movie, great acting.
B003XU02QG|4.0|Lots of blood and gore but comes with a story! A movie with a story seems to be a rare find. I liked this movie when I rented it from Netflix. I will end up buying it later. The acting was not bad and the country side was breath taking!
B001EN71CW|5.0|This is simply a review of the blu-ray for fans thinking if worth upgrading from DVD. The answer is very much so! There are times when the picture looks a little soft compared with what one expects on blu-ray (although partly intentional effects I think) but there are others, particularly group internal scenes which just blow me away and the most thrilling tv visual experience I have ever had. It almost seems as though the actors are physically with me!     As a fan I may be getting carried away but as someone very familiar with all these episodes I felt I was watching them anew and noticing new things and detail.    Suffice to say that as a newbie HD viewer this is my most exciting discovery over and above watching my favourite films.    And it works fine on a UK machine.    BTW the series itself is a beautiful gem! If you haven't seen it you owe it to yourself to try!
B0015DROBO|5.0|The story grabbed you and didn't let go from beginning to end. Very smartly written and entertaining to say the least. Characters are well developed with a very unique heroine. I was happy to see a male author write about such a disturbing matter such as the mistreatment and abusive behavior of men towards women in every level of society and the vindication of this real bada&*! girl. I eagerly awaited the second installment and the third when I was done with the previous.  I'm only saddened by the thought that the author couldn't revel in the success.
1848566190|5.0|I advice to all the people love the Cinema to buy this amazing inspiring book, not only people like graphic and design and art drawing but this book is for everyone!! ..Drew Sruzan an artist timeless...
B001AQO3QA|5.0|As stated by other reviews this collection is awesome in every aspect.  Great blu ray transfers check, great sound check, tons of extras huge check.  If your a fan of the series this is the must have edition.  The case is really cool too kind of a booklet thing but it works well.  I won't blather on because other reviews can give much better detail.  I just wanted to put in my 5 stars truly an impressive box set.
B002A2RDRO|5.0|This is a great album from a great band. Gavin Harrison had mentioned them in some interview and I decided to check them out. Very happy I did. I can't put a label on it other than \\"progressive\\" but that doesn't do the band justice. The style of music changes from song to song, showcasing incredible musicianship while perfectly blending styles that would normally clash. The songs/parts can change from something resembling coldplay, to A Perfect Circle, to Meshuggah and back again seamlessly. I'm very picky about vocalists and this guy is amazing. His voice is melodic, and haunting while changing to suit the song. Great range. This band/album is a great choice for anyone that's into complex music as well as fans of some of the bands I mentioned just looking to expand their horizons. A+
0061703087|5.0|I have only read the first few chapters and so far the tension is building up and I'm liking what I am reading. Get this book if you enjoy Michael Crichton because this one is just as good as his best sellers.
B0034G4P7G|3.0|The Social Network, in my opinion, successfully delivered the story of Mark Zuckerberg and his climb to fame and fortune.  However, I thought the movie failed in it's effort to tell us who Mark Zuckerberg is.  For that matter, I didn't feel that I invested too much emotion into any of the characters in the movie.  I felt as though I were watching a documentary that didn't focus on people, but the acts of people.  Because of this, I didn't really care who's idea Facebook was.  I didn't care who got the credit or the money.  In addition, the dialog in this movie was extremely fast, making it difficult to follow at times.  I certainly didn't hate the movie.  Remember, I said that it \\"successfully\\" delivered the story.  But in the end I realized that I just didn't really care.
B004498KPU|5.0|it has been almoxt 2 years, but the music, the mini movies. bring back clear and concise memories.  memories we will all cherise......
0307463745|5.0|It's rare that I read through a book in a few days. I typically lose interest. For this one, I read it in about 2-3 days. Light. Insightful. A good reminder or the fundamentals. I even learned a few new things/perspectives.<br /><br />Totally recommend reading it.
B003W5C0VW|3.0|Definitely vintage cinematography, but if you can get past that (which took a little while) the music is great and I loved seeing the YOUNG Stones again,
B004132HZS|5.0|The only possible way to follow Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes was to not try to outdo or imitate him. This did neither. My wife and I found this re-imagining to be creative and not derivative in the least, while remaining true to the intended original characterization of both Sherlock and Dr Watson. I expected to be disappointed and instead was vastly entertained. I hope to see many more of these...
B001UV4XFG|5.0|While this is a really silly movie, I had to have it.  Much better than the 2nd and Bella actually has some expression.  The commentary by the 2 actors is better than the directors commentary of New Moon (dull).  I like buying my DVDs from Amazon, this was a good buy as usual.  Simple to get and good delivery.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|I have had dreams like this movie and hated to wake up. This is such a heart warming movie all the while everyone in the movie is struggling with finding their own identity.
B000PHOY0A|4.0|This was an extremely informative and thought-provoking book.  It was a selection of my book club and it has reviewed to our club members by a retired teacher from the Highland Park schools in Dallas.  She was superb!  She made the book contents come alive and certainly made it more meaningful to me.      The book arrived in great condition and took on the challenge of reading it and I even referred it to my daughter as she is in the health industry.  Thank you for the great service.
0307454541|3.0|It is pretty much a readable, not really entrancing, crime story, packed with cliches, as they tend to be. Since it's swedish, it has the scandinavian cliche, the respectable family with it's dark secrets, side to side with the standard ones, the strong middle aged protagonist, and the other, strong troubled protagonist. To be fair, it is a genuinely sympathetic book, with an array of left-wing, feminist, anti-fascist, anti-corporation motives, supported by the author's professional experiences, and if one has decided to read a crime/thriller something, this would probably be a good choice.
0060853972|5.0|I bought this for my Girlfriend who is a huge Neil Gaiman fan and she loves it, great story and the book arrived quickly and in excellent condition. All in all, I am pleased with this purchase and would buy from here again.
B00006AUIG|1.0|I watched this with a friend because it got alot of positive reviews and was a free instant movie on netflicks.  We both sat there and were tempted to hit the fast forward button.  The movie is very slow.  The feel of the movie is even slow...sort of like they are trying to build up to something but never accomplish it.  The scenes are very disjointed so we were trying to figure out who goes with what and when. Some of the storylines were just dropped.  One worker got interested and rather obsessed with recordings of a patient.  He listened to all the sessions and the audience was introduced to the multiple personalities or \\"demons\\".  Then he just stops listening and the audience is to find out who is killing off the crew.  The \\"villian\\" and reasoning behind it were rather lame.  This isn't a horror.  I would not think of it as a supernatural thriller either since there is not anything supernatural about it except the lame reason the guy killed everyone.  I'm guessing it is more of a mystery even through the who done it part is lame.  It never really explained why him...the world is not nice so evil seeps in....ok....well then why not the other workers on the crew?  The main characters have done things that were not nice but yet only one person was the \\"villian\\".  I don't necessarily want to say the motivation behind his actions because that would be giving away the whole movie and if you do want to watch it I don't want to ruin it too much.

B0036TGSIK|5.0|If you loved Clueless and Ghost World, and miss movies like Heathers and The Breakfast Club, then this is the teen flick for you (regardless of your chronological age!).    Many of the characters are intelligent, cool virgins, both male and female, and are not in a rush to \\"lose it,\\" which is a refreshing change. I imagine I'd feel comfortable watching this with my daughter when she's a teenager-- more so than most teen movies out there!    If you are looking for other movies for tween or teen girls that are sassy and romantic without glamorizing casual sex / gross humor, try the Prince and Me series, Bend It Like Beckham, and Wild Child with Emma Roberts.     For elementary and middle school girls, I wish someone would release Scout's Safari on DVD, with the riveting, gangly, gorgeously unglammed Anastasia Baranova. It's about an American girl in South Africa, kind of a Little House on the Prarie meets The Crocodile Hunter! Very sweet.    Enjoy this one! Let's hope there's more like it somehow, some day...

0316098337|5.0|The premise of Emma Donoghue's novel, Room, is certainly off-putting. The child of a young woman and her kidnapper is being raised by his mother in an eleven-by-eleven foot prison located in the kidnapper's backyard.  And the kidnapper has visiting privileges.  Jolly, yes?  Ok, so now that you know the worst, I can tell you why you should read this remarkable novel.  The novel is narrated by the child, Jack, which could be annoying, but in Donoghue's capable hands is brilliant.   From the limited perspective of a five-year-old, all seems well in Jack's world.  He is happy.  He has an extensive if uneven vocabulary and an active imagination.  He loves Dora the Explorer  and hates green beans.   He and his \\"Ma\\" have a close relationship. She maintains a daily regime for him that includes Phys Ed, reading, drawing, and nap time.  But early on, despite the seemingly normal activities, we realize something is not quite right about Jack's home life.   Ma never talks about her past or explains to her son that they are actually prisoners in Room. For Jack, Room is the entire world, along with Wardrobe, Rocker, Skylight, and Lamp. But it becomes increasingly hard for his mother to keep up the illusion.  Ma knows the time has come to explain and escape.  Suddenly at age five, everything Jack thought he knew about home, identity, and reality is called into question.  An exquisite novel about love and the meaning of existence that transcends the subject matter.
142311339X|5.0|Loved the Percy Jackson books, but this was his best one yet!! Great read that keeps you guessing the whole way through! Lots of spelling and punctuations errors, but still great!
B002GTZSZU|5.0|The additional scenes added in this cut are interesting, and fill out some plot holes in the original film. Good pickup and good picture quality.
B003VQETL6|5.0|I am reviewing this for my grandson, as he was constantly reading it. He was introduced to it in school, but alas they took it away from him, as he was reading it when he was supposed to be paying attention to the teacher, or doing his classwork. I purchased it for home reading as he couldn't read it in school anymore. I had to get the rest of the series as he finished this one really fast. I am glad to see him wanting to read.
B0034G4P7G|2.0|This movie received a lot of hype, so I actually ended up buying the Blu-ray.  While the movie seemed well-scripted and the story telling seemed well done, there really was not much story to tell.  Pretty straight-forward plot about an ambitious coder who used a clever marketing strategy to tweak an existing idea to make lots of money.  He makes some poor decisions, which costs him a good friend.  I could have read about it on Wikipedia.    If you want to see a good story on the evolution of technical superpowers, watch the Pirates of the Silicon Valley.  I actually learned something from watching that one.    Bottom line, Netflix this movie, don't buy it.  Unless you buy into the hype, because that's all there is.
B00001W9G0|5.0|Unlike some love angles of diseased lover gone bad, Way We Were is concerning love dissolve, and maybe perhaps, wondering if love ever did happen. Clip of Barbra swiping away RR locks is jerker in name of release of non working affair. And movie song is legendary.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|It was a joy to listen to the interviews with three impassioned guitarists who are masters in their genre, each bringing a different style and attitude to their work.  For me it was the interplay between them as they discussed how and why they do what they do. I am not a musician, but this film was absolutely fascinating and enjoyable.
B000GIXLO8|1.0|I won't buy any other dvd from this seller. The dvd said \\"BRAND NEW!\\" But it looked like the seller bubble wrap themselves,the dvd was scratched in several spots and was unplayable. So I bought it at a nearby store same item exactly! This one had papers in it explaining scene selections and more, plus it wasn't bubble wrapped, it was covered in clear plastic which unused dvd's are with a sticker on it saying \\"Theater version and Extended version\\" Be weary of people saying product is Bubble Wrapped\\" ' cause anyone can do that!

B000XUBFE2|5.0|I had seen a review of this book on GMA and planned on buying it. For Christmas I received a Kindle from my husband. When scanning through the book options I came across it. As my first book purchase I am enjoying it. It is a story about a young girl during the beginnings of Nazi Germany narrated by death.
B00003CX8Y|1.0|Ordered on Amazon. From seller Jay Booklet this item, a birthday gift for a little girl.  She never received it.  Weeks later it is \\"in transit\\".  We emailed Jay Booklet asking why, and did not get the common courtesy of reply.
B00005JO20|1.0|Besides the fact that I liked both the original and the 1976 version and that this one stinks in comparison, there are two main reasons why I hated this movie.  1.Jack Black.  I don't know how the rest of you feel, but Mister Black has thoroughly overstayed his welcome in the public arena.  I cannot stand him.  I couldn't stand him six years ago.  When will he shuffle on back to his little \\"band\\" and his core audience of frat boys?  2.Naomi Watts' character.  In the original, Ann Darrow wants to get the hell away from Kong.  She wants to see him killed.  But in this version, she loves Kong and doesn't want him killed.  For those of you who think Peter Jackson has tapped into the spirit of the original and that the 1976 version is an aberration, you just consider that.  Jackson's film has far more in common with 1976 than 1933.  Then there are minor qualms: Adrian Brody and his nose, the black dude on the ship who says every last line as if he's pissed off, the nonsense about \\"The Heart of Darkness,\\" the fact that there really was no need for a plot at all: just as with Jurassic Park, I would have enjoyed watching the CGI dinosaurs without the bother of any human characters' presence.
B000HEWEE4|4.0|Very different, a little sci-fi, a lot of romance!  Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves were great as usual, but the story itself was what made the movie really great!  My husband and I both loved it!  Yes it starts off slow, but just keep watching, and pay CLOSE ATTENTION!
B001UV4XI8|5.0|I went to the local regal movie cinema and saw this one. I stuck it out with Harry Potter from beginning to end. Well considering I couldn't read the first 4 books until a later age because they came out when I was in grade school and I was only beginning to learn to read. I however did see the first movies from beginning to end all in theater. This is one of the best Harry Potter movies. I am glad they are doing the movies in parts because it just makes more since since the book is so long. If you are a Harry Potter fan you are sure to love this movie. After about 4th grade I started on the Harry Potters and went to every book release. I have also borrowed the audibles from the library to read. I own the 7th \\"this movie\\" on audible only because I got it on release day party and it was like 20% or 50% off since I had it reserved :D
0307588335|4.0|I have rated the book 4 Star, because it does give us an excellent step by step account how  Lehman Brothers (and several other banks) buried themselves in spectacularly large amounts of  frivolous mortgage risk. It is incomprehensable how the banks, even without proper regulation  were allowed to perpetuate this total fraud that required U.S. taxpayers to bailout all of this  worthless debt to prevent our financial system from totally collapsing. The book provides insight  on how the builders, the mortgage companies, the rating agencies, and the investment banks all  colluded to create these fraudulent packaged mortgages that paid off huge bonus commissions to   unscrupulous people throughout the entire chain.    My problem with the book is that the author seems to think that only he and a few admired friends  were the only people intelligent enough to see the collapse that was coming.  I believe that there were  many of us who knew that the  U.S. economy was a house of cards built on the huge amount of consumer spending  that was totally dependent on the housing bubble. What most of us didn't know was, just how much fraud the  banks were involved with in an attempt to prolong and magnafy the size of the bubble. I find it unbelievable  that no one in our government was privey to how out of control our bank lending had become.  There should be many  people in jail for this travisty and those bonuses should be reimbursed to the government. Ignorance or not,  the bonuses were paid on corrupt products, which nearly ruined our Country.
B003UYUQZW|5.0|Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is entirely a sword fighting, adventure type fantasy film.      I have to be honest though- the first 20 minutes led me to believe I was going to be entirely bored by one generic action segment after another, however this soon changed once we got acquainted with the actual characters.      Plus all the side characters that seemed jammed together incoherently in the beginning eventually made sense once we discovered more about them.  At first I was afraid this wouldn't be the case and that I'd be spending all my time trying to figure out who's who.    The storyline is pretty simple- a magical dagger has some time travelling abilities.  That's basically all there is to it.  Of course such a special weapon needs constant protection, which is how the adventure gets underway.    Many of the action scenes are quite a spectacle to watch, such as one specific scene near the end where waves of sand appeared to be flowing downward all the way to a black hole, and the princess and prince had to grab ahold of something in order to save their lives.  It kind of messed with my head a little bit watching the whole event take place, and I mean that in a totally positive way- very unique special effects.    There's also some fairly entertaining humor with ostrichs, snakes and chickens that come into play.  Mostly however, the storyline focuses on constant sword fighting.  It's a bit much, and I'm tempted to take away one star exactly because of the overabundance of it, but I won't.      Overall, a nice piece of family entertainment.

B004E547D8|2.0|Previews looked good for this movie.  That's about all that is good.  I was very disappointed.  Just not what I thought it was.  It took well over half an hour just for me to find one good thing in the movie.  Then, it was flat-line.  There are no realy highs or lows its just flat line.
B000VNMMWA|5.0|I bought this for my 18 year old son for his birthday. He loves British comedy and had not seen the movie. He has watched it several times and I always know when he is watching it because you can hear him laughing through the whole house.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Have heard great reviews from a number of sources. I'm also an avid Kindle user with over 700 books I've purchased. As many other reviewers, I refuse to spend more for an electronic version than a hard copy. I'll wait for the price to drop along with the others.
B004AR4WVM|5.0|I have this on both CD and vinyl formats. I'm a vinyl junkie, but both formats are excellent and the material very well mastered, as are all of Loreena's releases. I found this one quite refreshing and some of Loreena McKennitt's best work yet, but have never been disappointed by anything she's put out. The voice of an Angel. Highly recommended.
0811876373|3.0|I love the photos in the book, and I love that it is spiral-bound so it lays flat. However I tried the Valentine's conversation hearts, & they look awful! I thinned the candy melts with vegetable oil, but I think the cake pop itself wasn't flat enough to create a nice surface. (And I tried shaping them with a cookie cutter, and in heart mini cupcake-type pan).     BTW do NOT use the Wilton food safe markers on the candy melts. They won't write at all. Use a different brand. I have no idea how all the reviewers got these to come out nice. My son wants me to make some for his birthday, but I just don't think I want to spend another 5 hours for a mediocre outcome.
B00026WU7I|5.0|How can Amazon not list the track titles (as well as samples) for this phenomenal album? Unbelievable, possibly Dylan's best.
1608870081|4.0|Firstly, let me state that my 9yo Harry Potter fanatic daughter LOVED this book, upon receiving.  I can still hear her screams of joy when she opened it. :)  Having said that, she DID notice something off about the cover of this book, as did I.  -The Harry Potter on the cover looks nothing like Harry.  His mouth is sort of odd, and not quite the same as the \\"real\\" Harry would be.  If a 9yo can notice this, then surely the authors of this book noticed, and should have made sure it was more accurate.  Yes, it's a minor flaw, but still a flaw, nonetheless.      Additionally, on the page where the dragon pops up, and Harry is flying on a broomstick, it's inevitable that Harry will tear off and you'll have to tape him back on.  And not from carelessly opening the page, but from poor construction.  We have many pop-up books, and this one isn't the best quality overall, but still very enjoyable to look at.  It truly gives a feeling of \\"being there\\" for the reader/viewer.    Overall, while it's not the best pop-up book, I'm still very pleased with the purchase.  It's a wonderful addition to any Harry Potter fan's collection.

0385341679|3.0|I, too, looked forward to the publication of final fever book - in fact I had the date circled on the kitchen calendar! BUT - as an avid reader of KMM since I bought her debut novel, I found it to be, surprisingly, a let-down.<br />*SPOILER ALERT*<br />I must admit that I was looking forward to what would become the Fever Series since finishing Cian's story (\\"The Spell of the Highlander\\"), where in the final pages the Queen alludes to world chaos and \\"placing her five Druids in position\\" to save the world because the walls between the human and fae had fallen. Maybe that's why I was disappointed - so many of the threads so tantilizingly left dangling in her prior books were not tied together satisfactorily, or even mentioned, in this series. Why was Adam (\\"The Immortal Highlander\\"), who hated Darroc, gave him his scar, and was the reason Darroc was made mortal, not given more than just a paragraph in this story? Why was he not the 5th Druid instead of Christopher? If anyone would understand the gravity of the situation and have some insight into a possible solution, it would be the former Seelie Black Prince! And why include Christopher, who is an undeveloped character in this series as well as the Kelter series, at all? He apparently becomes so horrified by what is happening to Christian and the world that he denounces his Druid heritage. Really? During a time of his son's and the world's greatest need? How UN-Kelter!. I find it unthinkable that Adam, of all the Highlander characters, would hide from the chaos when the walls fall. His wife is a \\"super\\" sidhe-seer - where is she in all this? The Keltars are portayed as a petty, bickering lot, who try to communicate with the Draghar in the Fever series, (which goes against their beliefs so firmly established in their own stories)and for some reason, despite their Druid arts and powers, can not make a correlation between Mac and the book. For characters so well-written, defined, and revered in prior novels to be treated so poorly by their creator is disappointing at best.<br /><br />I realize that the Fever series is Mac's story alone and is therefore told from her point of view. I found her to be a semi-likeable character despite the annoying immaturity and constant self-doubt. I do believe that the story could have been told more effectively without Mac's constant introspection and by weaving together this story with all the plot lines from prior novels. The books are well-written, very imaginative, and do have Oh My God moments throughout. However, in this series the whole world in chaos cried out for the Kelters, the sidhe-seers, the Seelies and Mac to come together to save the world, and it should have been done without sacrificing the personas established in prior novels. I believe that persons who read the Fever series without having read her prior novels will enjoy it more than those of us who have read, and love, the Kelter series.
0446607274|4.0|The Bosch series just continues to get better with each book.  I thought Angels Flight started out just a little slow, but once the pace picked up, it really got rolling.  Connelly is a master at this genre, developing believeable plot and side storylines and producing characters with depth.  I have no intention of stopping here - gonna keep reading all the Bosch books in order.

0618918248|5.0|Brilliantly articulated, Dawkins outlines the lack of reason in religion and the terrifying willingness of people to attach themselves to things without thinking. This book should be read by everyone.
0312600844|2.0|There are enough factual errors in this book that could have been avoided with very little research, and I don't appreciate this lazy type of \\"literary license\\", so originally I was going to rate it 1 star, since I firmly believe a 500+ page book should not only be well written, but that references to geographical locations and current events should have some link to reality. In retrospect, I'm thinking Franzen may have made these errors on purpose, and is likely laughing his ass off at all the eggheads gushing over this book. For that, he gets the second star. My one word review is \\"messy.\\"

B0021L8UQ2|5.0|We've seen these kind of evil kid movies before.  From \\"The Bad Seed\\" to \\"The Good Son\\" to \\"Daddy's Girl (1996)\\"; yet somehow director Jaume manages to squeeze out something more from the genre. I watched this movie with low expectations, which it then, turned out to be the best thriller movie I've ever seen!!  Orphan not only has great acting, but very touching moments too!  This is one of the few horror/thriller movies that actually has  characters that you CARE about!  The actors were perfect for their roles and each has character depth too.  The best part about this movie is the TWIST AT THE END!  That completely caught me off guard and surprised me!  It was very realistic and made me think \\"wow, that could actually happen!\\"    If you haven't had the chance to see Orphan, then make the time to see this masterpiece!

0061726826|5.0|A Dystopian type romance that caught me off guard, and reeled me in. Lauren Oliver does an amazing job with her character descriptions and story lines with a smooth flow from the begging to end of the story. We meet Lena, who seems like the happy person, till her friend tells her a few simple words, things slowly sink in and you see Lena let go of the way life should be as told to her all her life and learns of what life really is. She falls in love, and learns of all the ups and downs that come with it.<br /><br />A fantastic story that will captivate you and make you feel what she goes through each and every moment, learning who Lena is and what makes her tick... not to mention having Lena learn who she is herself and how much stronger she really is than shes portrayed. I would certainly recommend this to you, and look forward to getting a copy for my own bookshelf.

B0049OSQ18|4.0|\\"Uh oh,\\" I thought right after I first dropped the needle on the new Decemberists' album, The King Is Dead. \\"This sounds like `You Don't Know How It Feels' by Tom Petty\\".<br /><br />When I first heard that song when back in 1994, I thought, \\"Tom Petty is obviously trying to sound like Neil Young...who was himself trying to sound like Bob Dylan.\\" Young trying to sound like Dylan is inspired. But The Decemberists sounding like Tom Petty was a portentous beginning for the sixth full-length release by one of the two or three best new bands of the new millennium's first decade.<br /><br />Fortunately, \\"Don't Carry It All\\" sounds like Petty for only about a single bar. Then The Decemberists get to the point of The King Is Dead: stripping away all of the prog-rock obsessions and mining different musical territory. According to front man Colin Meloy, R.E.M. was his biggest influence when writing and recording this album.<br /><br />In order to assure the authenticity of this claim, Peter Buck was good enough to play on the opening track and its follow-up, \\"Calamity Song\\". On the later, the guitar is so obviously Buck's that one almost need not read the credits to be certain that it is. However, the foot-stomping inspiring beat is also reminiscent of early R.E.M. songs like \\"Sitting Still\\", \\"7 Chinese Bros.\\", and \\"Pretty Persuasion\\". The lyrics, on the other hand, are pure Meloy, his tongue firmly in his cheek when he follows \\"Queen of supply-side bonhomie bone-drab\\" with a parenthetical \\"Know what I mean?\\"<br /><br />\\"Rise To Me\\" slows down the record's tempo a bit, and guitarist Chris Funk plays a fine pedal steel guitar. It also addresses someone named Henry, which, as music critic Greg Kot (Chicago Tribune) smartly notes in his review, is the name of Meloy's young son. Then the album picks up without missing a beat for \\"Rox In the Box\\", a dark but enjoyably existential sing-a-long which will please longtime fans with its use of according and violin. \\"January Hymn\\" ends the first half of the album on a melancholy note, and includes rueful the lyric, \\"What were the words I meant to say before you left?\\" (This and \\"June Hymm\\", which appears on the second half of the album, recall some of Richard Thompson's slower numbers.)<br /><br />Then comes the first single from The King Is Dead, the uptempo \\"Down By the Water\\". This song also features Peter Buck on guitar, as well as the wonderful refrain \\"The season rubs me wrong/The summer swells anon\\". R.E.M.'s influence is as obvious here as it is on \\"Calamity Song\\". As always, fortunately, Colin Meloy is clearly inspired by his influences. He does not simply imitate or copy them. Fans of both R.E.M. and The Decemberists, of whom I hope that there are many, will be happy to hear the two forces at work.<br /><br />No sooner is the influence of Athens, Georgia's finest obvious then comes \\"All Arise!\\", on which echoes of The Band--whose spirit weaves its way throughout the record--are also apparent. While this is an inspired effort, it is not one of the album's better songs. Meanwhile, \\"This Is Why We Fight\\" is lyrically less potent than it could have been, but Meloy choses his words economically, and the hard-rocking guitars and percussion help drive home the song's anti-war message.<br /><br />I first came to truly appreciate The Decemberists with The Crane Wife, the band's fourth full-length album. I was working in a record store, and the guy working behind the counter put it on. Although I was born in 1976, I was a huge fan of English progressive rock, especially Jethro Tull, in high school. (No, I was not the coolest guy in my class.) This helped make The Crane Wife the perfect place for me to belatedly become a devoted fan of The Decemberists.<br /><br />After working my way through their albums and EPs, with Picaresque (2005) and The Crane Wife standing as twin columns of brilliance, I was convinced--even a bit worried--that The Decemberists could do no wrong. Fortunately, I learned thatMeloy and company were mere mortals with the ambitious 2009 album The Hazards of Love. Don't get me wrong: that was a very good album, and was the next logical step in The Decemberist's creative growth. However, it was also the band's first album since its 2002 debut (Castaways and Cutouts) that did not hold together as seamlessly as their other ones.<br /><br />The King Is Dead, like The Hazards of Love, demonstrates that Colin Meloy--with the support of his band of top-shelf musicians--can achieve whatever he sets out to. It is not as good as Picaresque or The Crane Wife, but even when the songs on it are not great, they are admirably executed given Meloy's goals for the album.<br /><br />(Oh yeah, and you are less likely to need a dictionary to understand the lyrics this time.)Meloy and company were mere mortals with the ambitious 2009 album The Hazards of Love.

B003OTLVAW|5.0|I only have two complaints about this release.<br />1) The price<br />2) No multi-channel mix<br /><br />That's it. What else could you complain about? I have never heard S/T sound so good, from the opening track right through, this SHM-SACD delivers. Brilliantly open and natural highs particularly in the cymbals and hi-hat, defined and precise lows, Mark's guitar sounds simply incredible and the vocals are more cohesive than the SACD of Brothers In Arms, perhaps because the source material is on a better medium?<br /><br />I wish North America had these releases domestically, because everyone deserves the chance to hear how good this SACD is but at $55+ it will not help high resolution adoption at all.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about the SHM-SACD's because you're not sure about the cost and the fidelity, this isn't a bad option to take a chance on. These aren't priced in a range where I could order a few a month, but I definitely don't regret having this one in my collection.

He may even be a jerk in real life but who cares, the book is wonderful.   He gave me a few new ideas and that makes his book worth way more than the $14 bucks I paid for it. Some of the ideas I am using:  1) Slo carb diet - have lost 19 pounds in four weeks  2) Kettlebells and Turkish Get Up - Simple and quick workouts. My wife is using them also.    3) Running faster and further - goes hand in hand with the strength-building  4) Total Immersion Swimming - Getting the hang of it  I'm sure I'll institute many others. That is the greatness of this book, you can add a new idea each week and it'll take a year to go through it. Other books have only one or two good ideas and they stretch them over 250 pages.

0743486285|5.0|I have already read this book twice and I have recommended it to my co-workers. Rarely do you get to see someone bounce back after such excess drug use but Nikki Sixx made it happen. Not only do I want to commend him on achieving sobriety but having the courage to show himself with such honesty during the most turbulent part of his life with the Crüe.  The rest of the band also provides great insight to the life of rockstars who, with an endless amount of sex and drugs, still managed to come out on top after hitting bottom. Nikki Sixx also created a soundtrack for this book and it is the perfect other half for the memoir.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|For an expensive piece of technology, this product needs to go back to the design stage. Figure out what you want to work well and focus on it.

But there's nothing intuitive about this product. I can't recommend it.
B00006F7S4|5.0|This is simply an uncanny masterpiece! Yes, it's a break up album. but one of the best ever made. I'd give it six stars if I could. Beck doesn't have the greatest voice (but it's good), he's not the greatest guitar player or instrumentalist or any of those things. He knows however, how to take the most subtle elements and sonic touches and put them together in the most masterful way. His recorded voice is extraordinary. The string arrangements are some of the best I've ever heard in pop music Then there's the songs; Brilliant in a melancholy sometimes Neil Young kind of way. Song by song there is not even one mediocre tune. The standout for me is a tune called 'Round the Bend'. It's a bit of a homage to Nick Drake. Gently strummed guitar, voice and acoustic bass with lush strings that sweep across the arrangement like soft clouds. It's mournful, yet hopeful in it's effect

0307454541|4.0|I decided to read more contemporary fiction this year, and I started with this one.<br />It is not the best book I have read, yet it is not the worst either.<br />It's an interesting story with interesting characters. It took me a little over 2 weeks to read, without dedicating myself completely to this book.<br />Not exactly what I expected from the fame it has, I admit it got a bit predictable at the end but overall nice plot.<br />The story is very narrative and the switching viewpoints kept things very interesting. There is a lot of violence mentioned in this book, so it becomes a dark one for moments.<br />I think my overall favorite thing about this story is the use of elements so common in our daily lives (computer, internet). I think in terms of portraying current society is very accurate and very well written.<br />I haven't continued with the other two, I'm debating if I want to know more about the characters and see if its worth my while. Specially because I think the ending for the book was appropriate in giving us a glimpse of these character lives and the even that entwined them without making the reader desperate for more.

B004HAEGP4|2.0|I cannot believe that such a great video game franchise and existing story frame work cannot receive a decent film.  This movie is as cheesy and dumb as the rest of the Resident Evil films, complete with poor acting, a lame and inconsistent storyline, terrible characters, ridiculous effects and just plain stupidity.  I am amazed that they still produce these movies and that after so many attempts, it is impossible to make a decent one.  Please stop making such ridiculous movies...all your doing is killing a great franchise....don't waste your time on this film.

B0041KKYCY|5.0|I only rented this movie for $3.99 and it was well worth it. better yet, just buy it! I have nothing bad to say about this movie. it's worth every penny! if you can tolerate blood and gore, and enjoy suspense thrillers you should definitely watch this movie. her revenge was so sweet!!!
B0047S1KMS|5.0|DEAD SET is a fabulous miniseries. Only the U.K. could have made something so worthwhile in the miniseries aspect. The gore is great, the cast is fabulous, and the overall content I enjoyed. I saw 15 minutes of DEAD SET and I bought it right away without watching the rest. This definitely paid off. I would recommend this to anyone. I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
0735619670|5.0|I will be short as possible and say yes, you really should read this book if you want to improve the way you think about software construction. Now everyone says you should read it, but why? Well, here's my contribution to that question: Author has a unique way of explaining things through metaphors which is really helpful in a way that it lets you understand the concept quicker cause you can relate to this metaphor.<br />As a short conclusion, I really can't recommend this book enough.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|JJ Abrams' re-imagining of \\"Star Trek\\" is one of the most exciting films released in the action genre for some time.  He achieves a terrifically entertaining film through both holding close to the elements that made the original series so popular and taking it to the next level and allowing it to be sexier, glitzy, and best of all, the action and special effects are truly exhilarating.  The Bluray package is fabulous.    Abrams made the savvy choice to shoot \\"Star Trek\\" on film and not digitally, and the PQ is beautiful. The 1080p picture offers stellar contrast and exceptional fine detail from the pores on the actors' faces, the countless sources of brilliance on the sleek interior of the Enterprise to the tiniest bit of grime on the enemy ships.  CGI effects are dazzling to behold.  The soundtrack is mastered in Dolby TrueHD 5.1, my favorite codec.  While the soundtrack isn't as pounding as we might expect, the sound design favors a more realistic sound field and never exaggerating the effects.  The result is truly spectacular, and I'm not saying this is without bass, the LFE will shake your house when called for, and it excels at delivering the ambient effects whether its the murmur of voices in the Star Federation or the pinging and beeping of equipment on the bridge.  This is a reference grade disc and it makes a case as to why bluray is the format to go with.  Check it out on BD and if you haven't invested in a player, you will just to see films like Star Trek in all their lossless, 1080p glory.

030746363X|5.0|Let's start with a disclaimer...personally, I've been doing his \\"slow carb\\" diet for only one week.  I am writing this after my first \\"cheat day\\" session.  I have lost 7.6 pounds (not earth shattering, but certainly not bad) while eating more meals and a larger quantity of food than I have for the last 15 years.  What's more interesting than the pounds dropped is the inches missing.  2 inches off my chest, 2.75 inches from my waist, 1.5 inches from my hips...etc.  I want to reiterate...I haven't eaten this much food in years.  I haven't done any exercise to speak of.  My total commitment this week was walking, at a regular pace twice for 3.5 miles total.  About me: 57 year old male, 6' tall, starting weight 237.4, weight this morning 229.8.  I'm a desk jockey, hunched over a keyboard 10 - 12 hours a day, I have fused vertebrae in my lower back, chronic sciatica, mangled rotator cuffs in my shoulders and a lot of basic aches and pains stemming from an over ambitious and daring youth. This method is \\"brain dead simple\\" to follow and at least initially, it seems to be working.  I miss my loaded coffees (at least 4 a day with a pink and blue packet accompanied by Hazelnut creamer). I had a sweet tooth roughly the size of the Yukon Territory. This doesn't seem to important any longer.  I feel better, the pounds are disappearing, I'm shrinking and it's easy...as for the other parts of the book.  I've experimented with a few of the \\"techniques\\" (refining what I had already been acknowledged as being very adept at) with surprising results.  Timothy might be a \\"kid\\", but quite literally, he can be a force to be reckoned with and is changing the world, one under motivated individual at a time.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|I watched this for a second time today. I forgot how much I liked it the first time I saw it. It really is a tribute to the music of the Beatles. In a way it reminds me of The Wall (Pink Floyd). Both movies do a great job of portraying the art and imagery of the music. What a creative work of art! I highly recommend this movie.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Okay, I'm very late to this series, as you can tell from the date of this review, but I have to say, I'm thrilled I found it, so much so, that I absolutely had to write a review. So moved was I....    For one, I mention the five-star rating....normally, nothing (and I mean nothing) gets a 5-star review from me unless it is a classic for the ages (e.g., the German film \\"Das Boot,\\" the internationally acclaimed \\"Gloomy Sunday,\\" etc etc.), however, I moved from a 4+ star review to a 5-star review because of *just* one element in this entire series that by far epitomizes what's best about SPARTACUS, and that is, easily and handily, Andy Whitfield. I knew I was not going to be able to change my mind when I also started (again, belatedly, and just recently) to view the \\"prequel,\\" \\"SPARTACUS: Gods of the Arena.\\"    Andy Whitfield makes the film series magical; surely there is plenty to feast the eye upon from the get-go, I imagine ----- .... but for those who want something a bit more cerebral and rising above the sensationalism, exploitation, and voyeuristic feeding frenzy this series spawns ..... well, then, you need no look further than to Andy Whitfield's performances. Gutsy, more understated/reserved than the usual over-the-top-ness the series loves to deliver, and extraordinary in the displays of skill, from physical, mental to psychological. This actor has it in spades.   Whether it's a battle scene, a one-on-one fight to the death, a conversational interlude amidst the gore and action, or an 'ordinary' dialogue, Andy Whitfield delivers. Like. No. Other.    I won't likely see much more of SPARTACUS in the future. I think of Andy Whitfield and am beyond grateful that he elected to do this ... may we be so fortunate again to see his return. There is no Spartacus without \\"Spartacus,\\" there is no Empire without Rome - nor Rome without the willful Thracians.

1599218011|4.0|This is by far the best all encompassing book I've found about natural, holistic eating and overall health yet on my journey towards better health.  I feel inspired by Kris Carr's story and her health and happiness shines through her writing.  My only problem  with the book is that there is so much I want to implement in my life, but it's all going to take some time and money. I'm graduating from college soon and don't have the funds I'd like to have to get a good jump start. I also feel that some of these things may take time to implement into my life.  All in all though a great book.  Emphasis is on a vegan diet that also eliminates gluten and refined&alternative sugars/sweeteners.  Kris understands though if you don't want to give up everything that this entails but asks you to at least try to cut down and find healthier things. Like lean meats or organic, raw peanut butter.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in changing their lives, in all areas.

0316010669|4.0|Everyone makes snap judgments about people, places, and events. Sometimes those judgments are correct, other times not. But what if you're forced to make a big decision in a matter of seconds? What processes in your brain help you make that decision, and how do you prevent bad decisions from happening?<br /><br />Through fascinating studies and real life examples, Malcom Gladwell explores these concepts and much more in this book. As Gladwell states, there are three purposes to the book. First, to show that quick decisions can be just as good as decisions made after slow, careful deliberation. Second, to identify when we should trust our instincts and when we should be wary of them; and third, to persuade the reader that snap judgments and first impressions can be educated and controlled.<br /><br />To demonstrate Gladwell's points, plenty of pages are devoted to studies and examples that made the book sound like a marketing textbook at times. Descriptions of the many types of facial expressions were so detailed that it became monotonous. Also, I would have liked more tips about how to control snap decisions, but the book certainly gave me a better understanding of why and how first impressions are made. Having said this, Blink is a worthwhile read, and the concepts will compel you to reevaluate those snap decisions you make in your life.
B004529NKM|4.0|This movie is just about everything I don't like in a film. It's trite, it's stupid, it's got an insanely dumb plot, two-dimensional characters, and a checklist of cliches a mile long. It's a wonder it doesn't collapse in on its own pretension and turn into a black hole. And yet... I rather liked it. Oh, it's far from a great movie. But it has a certain amount of charm.    The plot, such as it is, centers around two rival dance troupes. They have silly names and call themselves \\"houses\\". One is lead by the handsome and charismatic Luke while the other is lead by the handsome and charismatic Julian. We know Julian is Eeeeevil because he wears black and has a sinister look about him. They take their dancing so seriously I kept having flashbacks to the \\"South Park\\" episode \\"You Got F'd in the A\\".    Into their world wanders a boy with the unfortunate nickname of Moose. Apparently he was in the other films, where I sincerely hope his nickname gets explained. He's played by Adam G Sevani, a very attractive, talented young dancer who gives the distinct impression of a gay person trying to play straight and falling short. He's cute and charming and very good at dancing.    He gets recruited into Luke's little dance troupe and we soon find out that Luke's home/rehearsal space is about to be foreclosed on. Thankfully there's a dance competition coming up soon and the prize is $100,000. It's astonishing to me that could possibly be enough to cover a mortgage on a large space in New York City, but whatever.    The plot goes from there with dancing, betrayal, dancing, romance, dancing and dancing, with only enough plot as needed to move the film forward. Really it reminded me of one of those porn films that pretends to have a plot when really all the audience wants is for the movie to do what it's meant to do. It's much the same here. I would have been far more interested in two hours of dancing footage and zero plot.    Speaking of the dancing, oh, goodness. Yes, it's quite impressive. It is what makes the movie worth seeing, and it really is worth seeing just for that. People do things I didn't know where physically possible. It was frankly astonishing what some of these people can do with their bodies.    But I do have an objection with much of the dancing. There's several scenes where we see dancing but it's so heavily edited it's very hard to tell exactly what's going on and to follow the action. That's a shame, because there's some real talent, but the camera doesn't take enough time to showcase it. This is less of a problem toward the end of the film, but it's a major issue at the start.    Ignoring that and the really, really stupid plot, this is a fun little movie. If you can just put your brain into neutral and coast along, you'll be just fine.

0385342047|3.0|Synopsis: Rebecca Brandon (nee Bloomwood), our favorite over-spending heroine, is now a mother to a precocious 2-year-old. Living in with Rebecca's mother and father, Becky and Luke have fallen on difficult times. Luke has had a tricky situation on his hands with a former client. Becky is still working at The Look, which is doing well after Becky's brilliant plan involving her designer friend, Danny.<br /><br />But a financial collapse in the London banking system makes Luke and Becky's situation more dire. No one is shopping, except perhaps Becky, so The Look is suffering. Luke's clients are in an uproar over the financial collapse. And in the midst of all of this is little Minnie Brandon, who is quite the opinionated, and possible out of control, toddler.<br /><br />Trying to brighten a dreary situation, Becky decides that the perfect thing to do is throw a surprise birthday party for Luke. Nothing lightens a mood like a good party, right? But can Becky handle the birthday party and a child that is running amock?<br /><br />Review: I have truly enjoyed this series, but I have to say, this is my least favorite book in the series. All of the things I adored about this book are true of the entire Shopaholic series. I love Kinsella's writing. Becky Bloomwood Brandon is a totally loveable and dynamic character. I love that the series is set in London. I totally dig the British slang and expressions.<br /><br />With this novel, though, I felt like Kinsella became confused during the telling of her story. The title of the book is Mini Shopaholic and the novel begins by highlighting some spectacular behavior on the part of Minnie Brandon. I had assumed from the title that this book would be about Minnie turning into a mini-Becky.<br /><br />Instead, the story really focuses on Becky trying to throw a surprise birthday party for Luke. The surprise party is 90% of the plot of this book. It should have been titled Shopaholic Throws A Party instead of Mini Shopaholic.<br /><br />I found the idea of Becky struggling with a smaller version of herself to be a much more compelling storyline than the one I ended up with. Reading 300+ pages about someone trying to plan a party is very dull. The small bursts of Minnie's antics and Jess', Becky's sister, unfortunate love situation were the only things that added levity to the long stretches of dull.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? I'm not sure. I guess if you are a fan of the series, then yes, I would. But get it from the library. I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.smaller version of herself to be a much more compelling storyline than the one I ended up with.

0385737955|5.0|This book was so hard to put down. It took me a while because I had to put it down at times to get school work done. Yet today I had some time and finished it in one swoop. I got hungry but was so addicted to this book that I didn't eat (a very rare thing for me, of which I don't advise ;). I really enjoyed his writing. Dashner's characterization was beautiful; I felt a connection to the characters and really cared what happened to them. The mystery in the maze and it's origins fascinated me. What I also really liked was that every chapter ended with some kind of a \\"bang\\" or \\"wow\\" that made me want to read on. I even found myself skimming ahead so much that I had to pull a bookmark out to block myself from reading ahead. I really enjoyed it and am excited to know that it is to be a trilogy and is even going to the theaters. I love a good distopian read, ever since reading The Hunger Games, and really felt that this measured up to a good addicting distopian read.
0439023491|5.0|After reading The Hunger Games, I didn't think Suzanne Collins could blow me away anymore than she already had. Turns out, I was completely wrong. The Hunger Games are far from over for Katniss and Peeta. President Snow and other individuals in the Capitol are extremely angry that Katniss was able to outsmart them and force them to declare two winners of the Games when there should have only been one. President Snow puts the blame for the uprisings in the Districts on Katniss's shoulders and threatens her and her family, and Peeta too, if she isn't somehow able to squelch the rebellion on their victor's tour.<br /><br />What proceeds from there is non-stop, unputdownable awesomeness. I could not put this book down. The drama and suspense of Katniss and Peeta's predicament and how they will manage to get out of it this time was positively riveting.<br /><br />Aside from the amazing plot, Collins continued to develop and grow the characters. The Katniss we know at the end of Catching Fire is a very different girl from the one we met in The Hunger Games, and that's a good thing. If the action of the story doesn't keep you interested, the fantastic characters definitely will.<br /><br />This book was amazing. I 100% recommend it.
0385528752|5.0|Why is it hard to lose weight? Well, if one of your very good friends is overweight, you are far more likely to become overweight. Want to start any new change at work? Then, you better understand herd mentality. This compelling book teaches us that the rational mind (the Rider) constantly jousts with the emotional mind (the Elephant) to make change (find a Path). Written in a light, entertaining, and immensely readable storytelling narrative--while drawing on a raft of sociological and psychological research that will astound and amuse readers--this is a book for all leaders. The simple bottom line for the authors (two smart brothers on faculty at Stanford and Duke respectively) is that in order to be successful change agents, we have to Direct the Rider, Motivate the Elephant, and Shape the Path. The authors present the struggle between these three elements. The Rider gets overwhelmed by data, so give him or her clear direction. What appears as pushback and resistance from Riders is simply that they're confused and lack clarity. The Elephant wants instant gratification and has no patience for strategies or rational plans. So, give the Elephant a feeling or passion he can associate with the effort--otherwise the drudgery will turn the Elephant (and the Rider) into two exhausted hombres. Finally, the Path--what looks like a people problem is often not and is more of a situation problem. Consider what lines on a highway do for the Elephant in us all...keep us on the path and out of others' paths.<br /><br />[...]
030745455X|2.0|I enjoyed this book much more than I did The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. That is not to say that I loved it, though. I found the plot of this novel to be better and more engaging. However, I find these books to be extremely long winded and bogged down in details that really don't affect the primary plot.<br /><br />This book did nothing to help me like/enjoy the characters anymore than I did with the first novel. The bottom line is that these books are just not for me. I won't be reading the third book in this series. I know many people have enjoyed these novels, but I am simply not one of them. I would recommend getting these books from the library if you are compelled to read them.
0312570740|1.0|will be honest when I say that I did not get through this book. It is so poorly written that I had to put it down. For other interesting books on oil industry see bryan burrough, daniel yergin, matt simmons, or tom bower.
0061733199|5.0|This book does a fantastic job of touching on a slew of subjects in a concise, easy-to-read style.    As an example, you can write a whole book (probably a few volumes worth) just on edible plants. But this book does a great job of covering the basics like: what to eat, where they grow, what they look like (complete with some illustrations) and just as importantly what NOT to eat.    This book covers everything from knot-tying to first aid to arctic survival to traps to signaling and everything in between.    If I could have only 1 survival book, this would be it. The gold standard, for me, was the U.S. Army survival field manual. This book is better in every way IMHO.      PS One thing the author says and I agree with 100%: it's not enough to KNOW this stuff, you have to practice.   Do some of this stuff in your backyard just to familiarize yourself with the basics. Plus most of this stuff is pretty fun. :)  I mean, you don't want to be learning how to build your FIRST fire in the dark of night after having survived a plane crash with a broken leg...

B003LZ5B7S|3.0|The entire first season feels coarse and jumpy as if cast and writers were both struggling to get the feel of Doctor Who right.  They never did.  And it is almost painful to watch the male lead. (I know he is a fine actor but it's clear that he could never connect with this character.)     I recommend buying this season, however, just to get the characters and back stories straight so you can better understand some of the plot elements in the FABULOUS season 2-5. That really adds (even though it feels more like doing homework than entertainment).
030726999X|4.0|** spoiler alert ** Following with my Star Wars analogy in from my last review (of The Girl Who Played with Fire) - this book is a \\"Return of the Jedi.\\" It's a great book that, if I objectively graded it on its own, is a really just a good book. The greatness in it is derived from the first two that sell you so well on the characters that your interest in their actions carries along through the story.<br /><br />Let's face it: the star character of this book series (Lisbeth) spends most of her time confined to a hospital bed in this volume. It's not exactly the most action packed of the three books. It is, though, engaging from the point of view of Lisbeth's story. She has become so interesting in TGwtDT and TGWPwF that we want to know more about her as a character.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson spent a lot of time in this book (and the previous) very obviously setting up for future stories: what became of Lisbeth's sister? What about her other half brothers and their crime circles? There was so much more to tell - but this is a solid ending to a series that will have to do.<br /><br />Alone, this book is three stars. As part of the trilogy: it's a solid four.

0307269752|4.0|WARNING! This book starts out really slow. Seriously. I almost considered giving up but all the hype behind The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo kept me going. The beginning is a conversation, in detail, about industrial espionage and corporate business drama that drags for bit. You just have to get yourself through it.<br /><br />Why?<br /><br />Once you do - the book becomes what everyone is buzzing about. TGwtDT is a great mystery novel and the set up for an engaging trilogy of books. Some of the cleverness in the writing comes from the fact that the author KNOWS the type of mystery he's writing (and even references it when discussing the fact that no one could have gotten off the island.)<br /><br />Per the sage words of bumper stickers on soccer mom cars across America: \\"Character Matters!\\" The characters are vividly detailed and Lisbeth Salander is a mystery unto herself. As you slowly learn about the unusual brain trapped in this VERY unusual girl, you become attached to the story she is involved with. This narrative is as much about her struggles as it is a missing person mystery.<br /><br />The book lives up to the hype and (if you haven't already) be sure to see it before the American film is made so you, too, can be \\"that guy\\" bitching about how the written version was better.

0743497465|3.0|After reading [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]] a few years back (along with the rest of the world) I became interested in Dan Brown and decided to read some of his previous works.<br /><br />This book involves proof of alien life that may or may not exist in the Arctic circle and a government conspiracy involving the evidence.<br /><br />Why yes - it DOES sound like the plot of an episode of [[ASIN:B0007X7044 The X-Files: Fight the Future]]. As a matter of fact, this entire book could have been retooled to be a two part episode with Mulder and Scully seeking out \\"the truth.\\" Instead, we get an oceanographer named Michael and an Intelligence Analyst named Rachel.<br /><br />Like reading the early works of Michael Crichton (an author I've begun comparing Mr. Brown to) this book allows a glimpse into what has become the formula for a writing style that is revisited in his future works: the well researched thriller. Dan Brown does his due diligence for each topic he writes about so the reader doesn't feel talked down to.<br /><br />Timely topics with intelligent details.<br /><br />I enjoy books that feign me into thinking I *might* be learning something, so I'd recommend this as a fun read... especially if you enjoy The X-Files.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Ah, love. There wasn't too much when initially contemplating this film : I didn't think much of Edgar Wright's other efforts ( the overrated \\"Shaun of The Dead\\" & \\"Hot Fuzz\\" )and had given up on the comic very quickly. Plus I'm not a gamer. Yet now I'm in love with SPSTW, & it's all about the F word.<br />As in FUN. This is such a giddy rollercoaster of cleverness, humour, snazzy visuals, wonderful acting and real HEART that it's failure at the box office becomes a tragedy of massive proportions ( hopefully it'll achieve cult status on video if there's any justice on this pathetic planet ).<br />Is it Michael Cera ? Are people sick of him playing himself ? Perhaps, yet here he's such a sincere & likeable presence that you can't help wanting the best for him. Winstead is also winning in what may be her most substantial role thus far. Not a conventional babe though quietly charismatic, she's the yin to Ellen Wong's ehthusiastic yang and you feel that Scott will be fine with either. Special mention to Chris Evans for the enjoyment he displays in sending up his superhero bread and butter but truly, all the players are great.<br />Wright's stylish use of his camera ( his DP is Bill Pope from \\"the Matrix\\", which can't hurt )also extends to lots of witty shot transitions, and the crisp clarity of the images is beautifully captured on blu-ray. The music, courtesy of Beck writing the band's songs is another plus and hey, here's a movie which doesn't struggle to last past the 80 min mark ! A quality piece of art should last as long as possible, a lesson which the makers of Cera's \\"Youth in Revolt\\" sadly missed.<br />So back to LOVE. Was there too much of it here for the WoW gaming crowd ? Not enough monsters and bloodshed ? Was SPSTW just too chaste for the geek hordes and was the gaming theme too much for the non-gamers ?<br />Hmm, I'll leave these thorny debates for the textbooks. In the meantime, sit back and have FUN. When was the last time you did that with a movie ?
0307269981|4.0|This book is what we film geeks refer to as an \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\" It's a sequel that is very much the superior piece in a trilogy that, no matter how good, couldn't have existed without part one.<br /><br />THWPwF is a great book that takes the intrigue behind the character of Lisbeth and elevates her from a part of the story to THE story. There's more at play than just a hacker/social misfit when it comes to Salander, and Stieg Larsson did a great job setting up the some of the details in \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" to help make this story suddenly move with breakneck speed.<br /><br />Part two of \\"The Millenium Trilogy,\\" it makes for great reading. The whole story seems like it could have been told with Mulder & Scully walking around in the wings: government conspiracies; cover ups; computer technology wizards; and secret family histories.<br /><br />This is my favorite of Steig Larson's books and the one that most makes me wish he were still around to keep the story going.
1400052173|5.0|This book is incredibly amazing and can appeal to a wide range of people. It brings up many important social and ethical issues and is definitely a must-read.
0807126063|5.0|You can credit the South Florida radio talk show The Love Doctors with my reading this book. \\"Doctor Rich\\" Dickerson would constantly bring up A Confederacy of Dunces as an influence in his life, so I figured I might as well dedicate some time flipping through the pages.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.<br /><br />I bring a unique perspective to this book as a self-proclaimed pop culture geek. It's from that mindset that I realized that this book is (wholly by accident) about the genre convention stereotype: \\"the fanboy\\". The main character, Ignatius Jacques Reilly exhibits the following qualities:<br /><br />1. Socially awkward to the point of being overly social. You know the type.<br />2. He dresses outrageously and is never without his mismatched hunting cap (much like cosplayers out of costume.)<br />3. He gets into long winded nonsensical arguments with about random things via letters (very much akin to online \\"flame wars\\" on fan forums.)<br />4. He cites Batman comics as the only impactful literature of the time.<br />5. He still lives with his mom while in his thirties.<br /><br />A Confederacy of Dunces is a satire that depicts the ridiculous antics of various folks in New Orleans on the 1960s. It is profounds in its biting commentary on people and essays have been written about the book and the deceased author (if you haven't read the story behind him, DO IT) - yet none that I have found point out the obvious (at least to me) connection to current stereotypes in fandom culture.<br /><br />If you've ever walked the around San Diego Comic Con or Dragon*Con, I suggest you take some time to read this and see how alive and well Ignatius is in today's society.
B000EXZH5G|4.0|I had heard tracks from Green Mind first, but Where You Been was the first DJ album I really absorbed and loved. I mean...you know ten seconds in it's gonna rock. Some of the songs are rather chill though. \\"Out There\\" is a great opener, and I might like \\"Start Choppin'\\" even more. I'm sure some fans of the early stuff don't dig this album as much, but now that DJ is active again, this could really be considered the mid-years. Another all-time fave of mine is \\"Goin' Home\\". You'll easily enjoy this album if you like Without A Sound, Green Mind or Hand It Over. I have the vinyl. It's almost frame-worthy.
0441172717|4.0|I recently realized that there are a numbers of \\"standard\\" books that, as a bona fide geek, I somehow missed. Dune was one of those books. Sure, I saw the eighties-tastic movie eons ago like everyone else, but I barely remembered a thing about it.<br /><br />With that in mind, I decided to see if Dune was all hype (as sometimes happens in literature linked to popular fandoms) or a legitimately good read. I'm happy to report that it is the latter. Dune's pulls off the political intrigue of interstellar royalty with a compelling narrative. The characters are vivid in their actions and words and you're left questioning, all the way to the end, whether Paul will live or die as part of his role in it all (since either outcome serves the greater purpose.)<br /><br />I couldn't help but wonder if this clever mix of politics, royal houses and science fiction is what George Lucas was attempting to achieve (and failed) with the Star Wars prequels. Dune makes for a great space opera... Jar Jar not included!
B0010VD7EO|4.0|This album I listened to based on the buzz when it was new and took a chance on it. Soooo glad I did. The first half of the album is about perfect. It is just pure pop. I think Kids is what hooked me first. It's like nothing I've heard, before or since. It could be loved equally by any child learning piano, or by any stoner totally baked. I figured that would remain my favorite song until I really absorbed Time To Pretend. What an opener, what an anthem! It builds and builds and is...yes, almost orgasmic. Such killer lyrics. Those two tracks are worth the price of the album, but Electric Feel and The Youth are amazing also. I have around 2000 albums. I'd call this one a top ten pick of the last few years. It really stands alone.
0792844882|4.0|i lved the movie, amazing choreo. sexy. short mysterious dialogue. just what i was hoping for.<br /><br />however, there is a rape scene in it, a gang rape scene near the end. so if you, like me, have problems veiwing such things, watch out for it. molly goes into a room w the guy w the long hair. just mute it and close your eyes for about 3-5 minutes and you'll be fine.<br /><br />minus that, it's a great movie very artistic and intreeging. shows how dance and sex can be the same and yet not. just how i feel.
B002RVZV9K|3.0|Well after hearing the White Stripes officially split last week, I was moved to rent this. This was a fun and easy watch, but I'm one of those fans of all three guitarists and bands too. I think Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White were well chosen for this. Three different generations of men, that love and rock the guitar well. I think the film spent about the same amount of time on the three of them, maybe Page was shorted a few minutes. I did enjoy the moments they just sat around and played their own songs, as the other two watched with smiles and appreciation. When Page cranked-up Whole Lotta Love you could see the Edge smile like a little kid. The opening minutes was Jack White making a guitar out of spare parts including a soda bottle, MacGuyver-style. That was cool. Are you a rocker? If so you'll dig this.
0307577589|3.0|I have listened to the 1st and 2nd books on the audio CD and the reader is excellent. This book is not nearly as good as the 2nd, but you really need to have at least skimmed this one to know the characters and their stories. I would recommend actually reading the book form for this so that you can skip some of the descriptions of places that go on forever. I think it would also help with understanding some of the Swedish names of people and places. I had a hard time keeping the characters straight because their names sound very similar and I had never seen them in print. I have a problem with books that go on after the climax(I didn't even finish The Lost Symbol by Dan Brown), but I stuck this one out. I'm glad that I did, because the Girl Who Played with Fire is definitely worth your time and it resolves some of the issues that were left undone in this first one. I would not recommend this to young readers as it is extremely graphic in places.
B0013FSL0C|4.0|As a psychologist, I really like the nuanced feel of this show. I find myself alternating between sympathy for Paul as he deals with his extremely difficult clients (I would hate Mondays if I had to see a patient like Laura every week), and frustration at his complete lack of his own self-awareness. The hostility that pervades each and every session and personal encounter in this therapist's life is EXHAUSTING to witness - but I'm sure that will play out in future seasons towards explaining his character more fully. I find myself hugely annoyed by him, rather than inspired as a psychotherapist - his rapid-fire interpretations, his stone-faced passivity towards the hostility and personal attacks by patients every day, his own childish anger-dumping and lack of insight with his therapist. Despite that I will keep watching the series because, well, it's still quite entertaining!

B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I thought I'd be getting a clean-cut look at how the Marines methodically move across the Pacific in WW2 to defeat the Japanese. I'm only through episode 4 and what I'm seeing instead is a dark and dreary depiction of this story showing slovenly looking Marines even when not in combat. Although Marines do use \\"racy\\" language I see no need to depict it so blatantly for the sake of realism. Also, in the episode about the Marines taking R&R in Australia after the Guadalcanal battle, the emphasis seems to be on sex showing one of the main characters being seduced by a girl in her own house no less the first day they meet; shortly after they are shown actually screwing together as if that's just a normal thing to show in such a video. The story is a little hard to follow as there's little supporting narrative. In particular the battles seem like just a confusing and chaotic set of scenes. Granted that's probably the way it was but it makes it difficult to figure out what's really going on. There's little indication of who's in charge and what the various commanders are trying to accomplish. I feel that this video, something like Band of Brothers but much worse, is simply a Hollywood version of the war emphasizing sex and violence for its own sensationalizing sake vs. what could have been an uplifting story about  this great accomplishment. Watching it leaves me depressed instead of being uplifted and proud of what the Marines did which I know is really the case! Again, Hollywood strikes again and makes a proud moment in our nation's history look like something we should be ashamed of. Maybe it will get better if I can bring myself to continue watching but I doubt it. When I'm finished I will probably trash it despite the cost as I wouldn't feel right about passing it on to anyone else!
0375703764|2.0|As a horror and Creepypasta fan, I was recommended House of Leaves many times, and unfortunately came to find it (upon purchasing it, I was SO sure I was going to love it) an enormous disappointment, as well as a complete and total aggravation. I regret to say that I'm fond of comparing the journey taken throughout this book to wading through waist deep garbage: You wade, you wade, you wade, and then \\"Oh! Hm. That's interesting.\\" You pick up a little something of interest, examine it, and continue to wade, wade, wade, wade. Then you literally repeat this process for about two weeks.    This book is heinous, and not in a good way. It's the single most frustrating piece of literature that I've ever come into contact with. One of the reasons being that, if I had to take a guess, I'd say a good 60% of it is near incoherency. At first, I was delighted by the madness of the format and the narrative. Later, less so. Upon about the 450th page, I was found the formerly delightful madness simply... maddening. From the irrelevant, fictitious sources, to the pages of blank space, to the incomprehensible (though I'll admit at least creative) compilations of letters and random, scattered, and repeated words. There is a scattering of story, but unfortunately I found very quickly that the time in between the tidbits you'll receive is greatly overshadowed by the time you'll consume reading through what isn't the story and has little (if anything) to do with the story. The layout does create a certain ambiance of mania or derangement, but the thrill of the absurdity dies swiftly at the hands of the sheer monotony. For me, this sums up the total experience of the book quite well.    I found myself yearning over and over for a normal version of this utterly insane book, so that I could at least see and read the story within without what metaphorically could be compared to blinders, sunglasses, and an eye-patch worn all together on the face at once.  To further add to my irritability, there was a point somewhere near the 300 page mark that the narrator, Johnny, began having an awful lot of sex. And when I say a lot of sex, I mean *a lot of sex*. Now, I have no problem with explicitness, but rather the fact that the frequency of this man's sexual escapades was taken to a point of pure ridiculousness. I can vividly recall seeing that a portion of Johnny's narrative was coming up, going downstairs to where my husband was on our computer, and reading aloud to him (literally as a running joke) the sexual endeavor we'd come to expect again and again from this character. It only added to the waves of tediousness I was already experiencing.    Though I love the idea of this book, the execution is literally an \\"execution\\" of itself. It's as if the book commits its own suicide.  I have the unpleasant desire to come face-to-face with the people who recommended this to me, along with the people I've heard say it's \\"The scariest thing I've ever read.\\" and stomp on their foot. I found nothing about this book scary or frightening, and I have difficultly imaging how something so heinously slow-paced and tiresome could ever be construed as such. I'd take a Creepypasta (which are completely free, by the way) over this book absolutely any day of the week.   Not only would one cost me just a tiny fraction of the time I spent reading House of Leaves, but the level of enjoyment and actual creepiness would easily be greatly exceeded.    While a small portion of the occurrences in House of Leaves were interesting (and, as I said before, admittedly creative) I found it very difficult to find anything about this book frightening when I was, god's honest truth, literally falling asleep each time I attempted to read more than twenty pages. In saying this, I kid you not; I fell asleep on what I'm sure was more than ten occasions of fifteen minute reading sessions. Had I needed a sleep aide, I can assure you, this book would have worked magnificently.    Long story (literally)short, I THOUGHT I would love this book. I bought this book. I wanted to open gunfire on this book.  Though I respect and am envious of those that enjoyed this book, I, regrettably, did not.
0061353248|2.0|The book had its moments, but in the end, was a disappointment. It seemed to have started with a conclusion, then interpreted various experiments as a means of supporting them. For example, the author demonstrated that more cheating occurs in certain situations, but failed to explain if it was large scale cheating by a few or widespread cheating by many. The same types of errors were made in regard to consumer behavior. Whether the irrationality was widespread, or simply extreme irrationality by a few was a distinction he never attempted to make.<br /><br />He then correctly states that the free market works well when each person acts in their own rational interest, but since we are all irrational, we need a central planner to tell us what to do. And, of course, he sees himself and his ideas taking on such a role. He even concluded at one point that we are willing slaves at heart (not his words) in that we truly yearn to be told what to do. However, if he is right, he is advocating a system where a few irrational people make decisions for the masses. Is that really so appealing?<br /><br />A prime reason why the free market should be left alone is that it is an incentive for people to act rationally. Isn't rationality a commodity in short supply already? Giving credit where credit is due, this book is somewhat entertaining thanks to a great job by the narrator. However, like perfume, it should be sniffed and not swallowed.
B0018PH3L0|5.0|This is the best movie of all time.  Lengthy (6 hours) but worth every minute.  Robert Duvall, Tommy Lee Jones and Dianne Lane had stellar performances as usual.  Angelica Houston was the only weak link.  Very poor acting on her part.  Definately should have found a better Clara.  However, the movie was wonderful.

B0041KKYCY|4.0|I remember in the earlier part of the decade, I ordered the original I Spit on Your Grave on VHS off of Amazon. I found it difficult to endure even for a diehard exploitation fan. Yes Im talking about the notorious rape scene. The rest wasn't that good, especially the pathetic handicap character. This brutal remake though, was pretty damn good. The story remains pretty much the same, with a twist of adding a redneck with a camera and a twisted small town sheriff. The handicap is there too, but not as pathetic as the original. It starts off slow and tense, and you know its the calm before the storm. Rape scenes aren't too bad because frankly Sarah Butler isn't that great of an actress. Bloody revenge scenes are a delight especially the infamous eyelid scene. Better than the original in my opinion. I cannot comment on the disc itself because I watched it on PPV, I am only reviewing the film itself. 4 out of 5.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I am fan of Harry Potter books. I love the movies, but sometime I feel something is missing from the movies. However, this one...so true to the book. The ending make me more eager than ever for the second part. It can be slow but smooth. Not even one bored part in the movie.

B00005K3O4|5.0|KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE is a clever, fast-moving scary/comedy that takes place during the course of an evening in Santa Cruz, California.  The movie was filmed in Santa Cruz, California, location of an amusement park, but in the storyline, the location is anywhere in the United States.  The movie is a complete original, but one can find similarities in THE BLOB featuring Steve McQueen (teenaged boy) and Aneta Corsaut (teenaged girl), ALIEN TRESSPASS featuring Eric McCormack (scientist), Jenni Baird (young waitress), and Robert Patrick (sleazy policeman), and INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1956).  (Please do not bother with the color version of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS (1978), because it is decidedly inferior to the original.)  One might also find similarities in the many films where clowns are depicted as pernicious and evil. The special effects and the music in KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE are unexpectedly good.<br /><br />GENERAL PREMISE.  KILLER KLOWNS begins with teenagers making out in their automobiles, just as in the opening sequences in THE BLOB and ALIEN TRESPASS.  The heros of the story, Mike (boy) and Debbie (girl), noticed a shooting star, investigate, and discover a circus tent.  They go inside, and discover that it is really a rocketship, complete with colorful buttons, bubble chambers, a vast hexagonal chamber several stories tall, and pink pods.  The pink pods are made of cotton candy, but inside are human beings being incubated.  During the course of the movie, the clowns amble into town, entice the townsfolks, and play various tricks on the townsfolks and then zap them with ray guns.  Mike and Debbie spend much of the movie trying to convince the townspeople that they are in danger.  Eventually, Debbie is captured by the clowns, and Mike finally acquires the cooperation of a young policemen and two young men (Terenzi brothers) driving an ice cream truck, where the goal is to rescue Debbie.  The Terenzi brothers are a recurring themein this film, but they eventually prove crucial to the resolving the danger of the Killer Klowns.<br /><br />CLEVER IDEAS.  The movie overflows with an abundance of ideas.  Here are a few:<br /><br />(1) After Mike and Debbie discover the circus tent spaceship and explore the interior, they are discovered by the Killer Klowns and they run out and escape into the forest.  The Killer Klowns follow them, with the help of bloodhounds.  But the bloodhounds are really colorful balloons that are twisted into the shape of dogs (we have all seen clowns making twisted balloon animals at parties).  The balloon-dogs act like real dogs, and run, and sniff the air.<br /><br />(2) A clown walks down mainstreet.  It wants to avoid detection by shoppers.  The clown spots a motorized gorilla in front of a drugstore, waving its arms slowly around.  The clown then stands near the gorilla, and mimicks the gorilla's arm-waving actions, thereby avoiding detection.<br /><br />(3) A clown sets up a little puppet shown in the town square.  A teenager views the puppet show, which features a boy puppet and a girl puppet.  The boy puppet wants to get romantic with the girl puppet, but the girl puppet pulls out a ray gun and vaporizes the boy puppet.  (The teenager laughs at this.)  Then, a Killer Klown stands up, holding the girl puppet and the ray gun, and the Killer Klown vaporizes the teenager.<br /><br />(4) A small Killer Klown rides a toy motorcycle into a dark alley, where a motorcycle gang is meandering and loitering.  The small Killer Klown parks his little motorcycle, and one of the gang members decides to have fun and pick on the small Killer Klown.  The gang member says, \\"What are you going to do?  Knock my block off?\\"  Then, this is what happens, the small Killer Klown actually knocks the man's head off, and it lands in a trash bucket, and the headless body collapses.<br /><br />(5)  In a scene at a burger restaurant, a Killer Klown stands near the door, beckoning to a 6-year oldgirl who is inside dining with her mom.  The 6-year old girl approaches the door.  The Killer Klown plays peek-a-boo with his hands covering and uncovering his eyes, in an attempt to attract the girl.  (Whoever wrote the screenplay has a high degree of awareness of little children.  This scene was very, very accurate in this sense, and scary too.)<br /><br />(6)  A group of elderly people, perhaps in their 80s, are waiting at a bus stop at night.  A Killer Klown begins to entertain them with hand-shadows.  The old people are charmed.  They smile and laugh.  Then, the Killer Klown makes a shadow-puppet of a tyranosaurus rex, and the shadow eats the old people.  Gulp!<br /><br />THE PLOT MOVES FORWARD.  In addition to the clever episodes disclosed above, the storyline features Dave (young policeman and protagonist) and Mooney (obnoxious older policeman).  The teenagers complain to Mooney about the Killer Klowns.  Mooney receives various phone calls at his police desk regarding the Killer Klowns.  But Mooney dismisses all of these as pranks.  Mooney curses at the teenagers.  But eventually, one of the Killer Klowns pays a late-night visit to Mooney, and that's it for Mooney.  At about this time, Debbie is shown getting undressed at home in her bathroom for a shower.  Nothing X-rated is shown.  There are not even any cheesecake scenes.  The bathroom scene is entirely appropriate for the juvenile audience. (So don't worry, parents!) As the plot moves along, the storyline returns now and then to the bathroom and Debbie, and eventually the Killer Klowns overcome Debbie in her bathroom and encase her in a large yellow balloon, and bring her to their rocketship tent.<br /><br />Another recurring theme is where the protagonists (Mike and Dave) encounter more and more of the cotton candy pods.  Yet another recurring theme -- more a running gag -- is the Terenzi brothers, and their goal of using a large ice cream truck as a way to attract girls, so that they can find girlfriends.  While the Terenzi brothers and their truck appear to be merely a running gag, they eventually provide crucial to resolving the problem of the Killer Klowns.  (I DO NOT GIVE AWAY THE ENDING.)<br /><br />CONCLUSION.  The various plots and sight gags are skillfully woven together.  The plot moves along with the velocity of hurricane.  The colors are abundantly splashy and a treat to the eye.  The interior of the circus tent rocketship is detailed, colorful, and was (in part) inspired a typical amusement park fun house. The movie is clever and well-organized in the same way that a Mozart sonata is clever and well-organized.  The only negative thing that I can say about this film is that the clowns are too scary for children under seven years old.

B00005JMJG|5.0|(sigh)<br /><br />Thinking just isn't in style in this country anymore, is it?  Reading the negative so-called \\"reviews\\" of this gem is like reading a page or two of historical \\"wisdom\\" from a certain attention-craving, ex-(part-time)-governor from Alaska.  It's just sad to realize that our education system has failed THAT badly.<br /><br />Ah well, pointing at lemmings never makes them anything but sillier.<br /><br />About the movie:<br /><br />This critically acclaimed and Oscar-winning screenplay provides a typically brilliant, quirky and chancy role for Kate Winslet, who has opted to be in some of the most interesting (and intelligent) flix in the last two decades (and I ain't just talkin' 'bout Titanic, folks).  The supporting cast is also very good, and well-selected.<br /><br />The real surprise here is Carrey, who is almost exclusively known as a master of silly, physical comedy.  With the possible exception of The Truman Show, this may well be his best (and is certainly his most sensitive) role, ever.<br /><br />Entertaining on several tiers, this movie definitely has its hilarious moments, and is continuously entertaining. Though billed as a \\"romantic fantasy\\", the film also crosses into the realm of smart, speculative fiction-- reminiscent of Harlan Ellison, or Phillip K. Dick. Yet it also manages to keep its plot points grounded in the emotional realities common to anyone who's ever suffered for love.  And there are some quite touching moments, which might just have you in tears, as well.<br /><br />Well Done!

B004B8DH98|5.0|Very well done movie....I see why George Clooney chose to be in the film.  And Clooney delivers a very deep character that only Clooney can pull off.  If you watched Michel Clayton, then you will see glimpses of that portrayal in this movie too.  It's more about what is not being said and the underlying feelings and currents that makes this movie exceptional.  You actually have to pay attention to nuances instead of being spoonfed.  I watched this movie 2 months ago, and it echoes even now.  If you are looking for an action, knock 'em sock 'em type of movie then this isn't it.  If you are looking for a heavy duty plot like Inception, then this isn't it.  But, if you are looking for a movie that delves inside a man caught between what should be and what is...Man against himself, Man against Nature and Man against Man...then you will love this movie.  And from an artist's viewpoint, this is a masterpiece.  Well done!

0062064304|5.0|I was really overjoyed when I received my copy of 'The Art of District 9'. After having watched this movie for the 8th time, simply can't get enough of it, I thought this book a nice extension to the visual experience of the motion picture. The book is divided in clear, thematic chapters, full of sketches, models, color studies, linguistics, uniforms, etc... It's a delightful book, beautiful finishing; a must-have for sci-fi artwork lovers.
0061120073|5.0|This is a coming of age story and I know that is such a cliche - especially for a debut novel. But this coming of age story is one set in a world that I had never read about before. How is that possible, you ask? It's set in Brooklyn, right? Every story about Brooklyn or NYC has already been told, millions of times. But I'm telling you, this one is different. The main reason it's different is because this Brooklyn story is told through the eyes of young Francie Nolan, one of the most glorious characters ever created in literature. Truly, she's almost indescribable. She's smart without being precocious, at times sad but never maudlin, and traversing the world of Brooklyn at the turn of the 20th Century with her is one of the greatest reading experiences I've ever had. I will love her forever.<br /><br />This book is about family and community and love and education and poverty and strength and mistakes and triumphs and growing up. It is filled with the most amazing characters and paints a picture of America that is utterly new to me and leaves me believing there IS magic in America, magic in the neighborhoods we call home, magic in our childhood memories . It will make you laugh and cry (I cried three times, a record for me, while reading a book) and as soon as it is over you will vow to return as soon as you can.<br /><br />So if you've been putting it off, or if you've never heard of this book before, or if you haven't read it in years, do yourself a favor and read it now. And then reread it.
0786955570|5.0|This seems to be a very good remake of HeroQuest! We bought this for a friend for Christmas (they love board games and we play D&D together) and we all set down and played it one afternoon. I haven't played all the modules yet, but here's our opinion on the product.<br /><br />Like: Overall it was very fun, challenging, and required teamwork.<br /><br />This game requires you to work together as a team (if more than one player), so it's great for playing with kids to build teamwork skills.<br /><br />Cooperative play means you aren't playing against each other. There aren't many games out there that don't pit you against a friend. There isn't even a DM.<br /><br />This game was challenging without being too difficult. There were times we came really close to losing, but we always scraped through.<br /><br />The minis are good quality plastic (similar to minis out of the D&D Miniatures Collection) though unpainted. We did not find this to be disappointing however, as our friend enjoys painting miniatures himself.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br /><br />There are a lot of pieces (though not as many as [[ASIN:1589942108 Arkham Horror]]) and they're made out of cardboard. They are good quality but frequent use can degrade paper pretty fast. I highly recommend little snack ziplock bags to keep all the pieces separate. A large table is definitely needed for this board game.<br /><br />Overall this game was great fun. It's important to note it is NOT D&D. However, it is similar in style to D&D 4th edition, but the rules are not the same.
B00008CLOA|4.0|This is a technical review only on the merits of the sound quality and the mix itself. I give this release 4 stars for the sound quality, what you would expect from the high bit rate SACD format. Too bad this format did not survive - this is what the CD should have been. The high end sparkles, good bass and no mud. Some of the vocals are a bit shrill but that may have been distortion on the source tape itself. BY the way, you need an SACD player to play this disc. I have the Sony DVP-NS775V which is a great model from around 2005.<br /><br />From my perspective having owned four different formats of this classic Floyd album since the early 70's, no one could improve upon the original 2 channel and 4 channel mixes, which Alan Parsons worked his magic on. The 2 channel mix here passes- I didn't notice anything glaring. But I am disappointed with the Surround mix. Compared with my original Quad tape from the 70's, this mix is too blended for my taste. So instead of discrete instruments panned to their own channels, mostly what you get is a blended ordeal. For example, while the bass, vocals and drums are prominent in the front, about 20% of that is mixed to the rears on every tune. Now you and I know that most audio setups have lesser quality speakers in the rear, and we should not have any bass or main drums going back there. There are some good moments here though such as the sax solos (front only), some background vocals (rear only), the 'lunatic' and a few instruments here and there being isolated to one or 2 speakers. The mixing engineer James Guthrie did manage to keep Parsons' brilliant Money cash register sequence intact - sounds emanate from all 4 corners just as the original Quad mix. Surround mix engineers who blend like this must assume we're going to play a surround disc without some of our speakers connected! This was the same deal on a few (but not all) the recent Genesis (dts) Surround releases- they missed a great opportunity there too. Want to hear some great, discrete Quad mixes - check out several early Moody Blues available on Hybrid SACD or Steely Dan's Gaucho on DTS (nothing in the rears but horns, backing vocals, percussion, some guitar riffs and organ - now that's what I'm talking about).<br /><br />Still, the Surround mix presented here is probably the only one available today, the sound quality is high end and this is more satisfying than listening to a dry stereo mix. So go for it and enjoy.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown has created another entertaining novel, this time focusing on the symbology of Washington DC and the FreeMasons. He uses the same style as Da Vinci Code with a new setting. It may not be new or different, but it is enjoyable never the less.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Da Vinci Code, you'll enjoy this one too! (This will also make an interesting movie.)
031603438X|5.0|This is a superb biography.  Sort of like sitting down with Richards and having him tell you everything about himself.  It wasn't catty, and he doesn't blame anyone for his druggie years other than himself.  You don't have to be a huge Stones fan to enjoy this.  Ronnie Woods bio was quite good, but can't hold a candle to this one.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|Eminem is BACK with his genius wordplay, flowing incredibly through each beat with finesse in syllable emphasis. Just as you thought the highest selling artist of the decade has fallen off with his skills because of Encore and Relapse, this album recovers in a big way! I'm SO glad this album is a departure from Relapse/Encore. IMO, those CD's were going a different direction for Eminem that wouldn't have been good if he kept it up.<br /><br />To this Day, The Marshall Mathers LP and The Eminem Show reign supreme as my fav. Eminem albums, both different in MANY regards, but Recovery finds a way to be different and a whole new type of 'new'. This is one incredible album and shows Eminem's skill as the G.O.A.T. I can't wait to see what he comes out with next.

0765326353|5.0|I tend to enjoy Brandon Sanderson's works though he does have a pattern of the weak and/or oppressed ending up having power. This isn't distracting in this book and lends flavor to the work so far. I liked the way he wrote the sections in this one, allowing as at each beginning of a section to know what characters we could expect to read about in the following chapters. The characters were well written, even if they weren't the most well rounded. I am not disappointed by this, as I expect there to be quite a bit of development in the rest of the series, especially if each book is as long as this one.<br /><br />I liked having so much material to read, but I will say I wish I'd has an e-reader! I was pregnant and I'd planned on reading in the hospital, but the book was so big and thick it was very difficult to read on the table provided. In addition, after I had the baby, it was really hard to hold him and the book and since it was so large I was very worried about dropping it on my newborn. I did have some wrist pain while reading it and for about a week after, thought that is in combination with my baby. I do recommend the digital version if you have an e-reader.
B003L77G10|5.0|The exquisitely written and stunningly executed CBS drama \\"The Good Wife\\" (created by Michelle King and Robert King) airs here in Australia on Network TEN, and I love it!!!! Season One certainly set the tone for what was to come in Season Two with just the right texture of family and legal drama. But it is the intrigue of intra-office politics taking center stage in Season Two which takes the viewer captive, and leaves you with a thirst for what is to come in the next episode.  If this tv show was a novel..... it would be a real page turner.  I highly, highly, highly recommend it.  And I look forward to the DVD!!!!

0439023521|5.0|I'm in my twenties and this book, as well as the other two in the series, is the best story I have read in a long time. I couldn't put the book down and read all three in less then a week. It's been two days since I finished and I am still thinking about the characters and their stories. It's not for the faint of heart, but almost everyone should read this book.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have all of Josh Groban's albums.  I bought this one the day it came out.  I listened to it, and thought yuck...what the hell?  Nothing like his first few albums...but wait.  I played it a few more times later, more and more, and WOW this album grows on you.  What a wonderful voice and choice of songs.  I can't help not listening to it all of the time now...almost daily!!!  I WANT MORE JOSH!
1439177783|5.0|Like everyone else, I knew that Portia de Rossi is Ellen's wife. I loved her when she was an attorney on Ally McBeal. But, I was not prepared for the level of honesty and truthfulness, she used in \\"Unbearable Lightness.\\"<br /><br />Portia is quite candid about her self-image issues and how she dealt with them. She does not shy away from discussing in detail her bouts with binging and then purging. She even discusses that at one point in her life, her meals only consisted of wine.<br /><br />This is a great story for all young women and young women at heart to read. We all deal with self-esteem issues just like Portia and this book delivers on how to conquer our demons. She truly deserves all of the happiness that she is experiencing now.

044654759X|4.0|Nicolas Sparks is one of my favorite authors.  I've read all his books so it was just a matter of time till I read this one.  I must say he seems to be changing his style somewhat.  Instead of a tear-jerker, this time suspense is the word.  The beginning is kind of slow but as it progresses, the reader becomes anxious for the eventual confrontation.  At one point it's hard to put the book down.

B0000029AP|5.0|Toys in the Attic, along with Rocks, is the best of Aerosmith.  While I'm partial to Rocks as the band's best album, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry's songwriting really blossomed here and every track is a winner. The opening title track was their most blistering song to date and bordered on punk when the genre was in its infancy. \\"Uncle Salty\\" and \\"Adam's Apple\\" are great tunes with double entendres galore and the latter's horn lines complemented the song's dirty groove perfectly, \\"No More No More\\" is a strong mid-tempo joyous rocker similar to \\"Sick as a Dog\\" from Rocks while the spirited cover of \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\" is top notch and still gets some classic rock airplay. The album's second half spawned two hard rock classics and staples of AOR radio. \\"Sweet Emotion\\" would give the band their first touch of Top 40 success and its bass line and guitar riff are still very recognizable today. \\"Walk This Way\\" is the quintessential Aerosmith song with two super hooks in its guitar line and simple yet effective chorus. By contrast, \\"Round and Round\\" with its menacing delivery, shows the band at their heaviest and is one of their best deep cuts. \\"You See Me Crying\\" is one of the band's many album ending ballads (\\"Home Tonight\\", \\"Mia\\", \\"Darkness\\", \\"What It Takes\\", etc) and while not on the level of their classic \\"Dream On\\" is still pretty good. Toys in the Attic is pure 70's hard rock heaven and one of the great classic hard rock albums ever released. Highly recommended.
0312600844|5.0|Janis Joplin, I was singing along with you all the while I was reading Jonathan Franzen's hefty new novel \\"Freedom.\\"  As someone who decidedly did not care for The Corrections, I approached this 550 page tome with a prejudice. I was a skeptic. As I turned the last page, in what was, for me, record time, I came away contemplative and appreciative. Contemplative in that I sensed that this was a very complex, ingenious and provocative work and appreciative in the masterful means by which Franzen had accomplished his goals.     This novel isn't so much a novel about freedom as it a novel about the lack of it that we have in reality. We are at the mercy of our upbringing, our parents and siblings, our wives and lovers, our children, our employers, the world in general. Franzen deftly reminds us, time and time again that every one of us sees things through a different perspective and that each point of view has its very own history, giving it at least superficial merit. We can argue our heads off trying to explain our point of view but as no one else on earth sees through the same lens, the more we fail, flail and self-destruct in the attempt. It's one thing to listen patiently (or impatiently) to a differing view. It's quite another to admit to yourself that you don't have the gospel. Franzen reminds us that our customary responses of violence, aggression, passive-aggression, avoidance, denial, whatever, are all doomed to outright failure and may make matters even worse.     This is, superficially, a story about the long and rocky marriage of Walter, an environmental lawyer and Patty, a college basketball star. To say \\"it was made in heaven\\" is far from the truth, but it is equally far from hell -- although when you're in the moment it may seem very much like one or the other. I think it would be difficult to find a reader, other than one orphaned at birth, who didn't find resonance in the nuances of parents' favoritism or neglect. Similarly, any of us with a sibling ormore will recognize the familiar themes of sibling rivalry. Indeed they play out daily in probate courts across the land. Children wish, as always, to be free of parental control, only to find that they end up behaving like their parents, even as they attempt to fling themselves to the opposite end of spectrum. We try to do good. We think we are doing good. Convince ourselves. Rationalize. And it the end, we find that we've compromised our integrity. Such themes are the universal bane of imperfect mortals, and the author explores each one masterfully.     As I hinted, this weighty book moves fast. It captures interest and doesn't release it, even after the story comes to an end. You know in your heart though that the story really hasn't ended. I can never end. As Patty says, \\"Mistakes were made.\\" Being the creatures we are, we will continue to make them. All we can hope to do is to learn to recognize that every story has multiple perspectives, each worthy of a good looking at before we make a final judgment. ... And learn that if, after you should have cooled down, you are still bothered about the outcome, maybe the best option for you is to forgive.     Freedom has been on my mind since I read the last words. Enough said.     Barry S. Willdorf, author of Flight of the Sorceress.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|not only were there some interesting shots of the fields  and one small almost medievel town in Italy, the film begins in a snow filled field in Sweden, when the main charecter of Jack is walking with his girl friend.  suddenly there are shots and Jack engages a hidden (?) assasin who he  easily dispatches.  for good measure Jack then dispatches his girl friend.  after quickly getting rid of the assasin's assistant, Jack flees to Italy, where his boss (?) sends him to  a remote town to hide out.  Jack doesn't seem to trust the town he's sent to so he goes to another  nearby town, where he meets the Italian version of the Irish priest usually played by Barry Fitzgerald.    he  tosses the cell phone given him by the boss but calls him to check in.  the boss gives him a job of building a slienced assault weapon.  somehow another Swede shows up to finish the job  begun in that snowny Swedish  field, but naturally Jack takes off his shoes, and after  an innocent bystander is killed, he again dispatches his attacker.  now he's wondering how the Swedes found  him in the hills of Italy, calls the boss who tells hime \\"He's lost his edge\\".  will Jack prevail and survive  till the  movie's end.  by this time, who cares?    if i went any further, i'd \\"spoil\\"  the ending if this film which i won't do.  if  you want to find out  just what's going on, then waste the entire   hour and forty five minutes yourself and watch this whole boring mess of a film.      no where is there any explanation of anything.  why are the Swedes so angry at Jack? who exactly does he work for and why?  is the Boss behind all the attempts to get rid of Jack?  Why?  no one is going to tell you.  Maybe the butterfly that  is thrown in your face knows, but he's  too busy flitting around to tell us.

B000SO7OM0|5.0|I love Loreena Mckennitt music and have owned few of her albums for the last couple of years. But it was amazing to see her sing and watch all the other (some unusual) instruments in the DVD. Some of the songs are simply masterpieces. Highly recommended.
B0048LPRD2|4.0|Since many people have gone in depth on the story and aspects of the actual movie, I will keep my review brief and to the point. I love this movie. I have seen this movie in three different formats now, a very good quality rip, the \\"HD\\" streaming version on Netflix, and this Blu-Ray that I just purchased. I am sad to say that I would almost rather watch the rip than my blu-ray copy. The blu-ray suffers from the frequent grain problem that has plagued a variety of blu-ray releases. There is definitely more detail in the picture, but since the majority of the film has a dark backdrop... a heavy layer of grain is almost constantly on screen. With a movie like this in particular, one in which the viewer is immersed in the experience of the character, it definitely pulls me out of the story and makes me realize that I'm watching a movie instead of living an experience. I don't regret buying the blu-ray for the sole fact that it is the full-length director's cut, but it is disheartening when the \\"highest quality\\" version of the film is hidden behind an annoying layer of grain. I am almost contemplating trying out the DVD version to see if it looks better up-scaled by my player without the high-quality grain.
B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater has a consistently strong catalog of music. All of their albums are different while retaining their signature sound and stellar musicianship. However, if I were to recommend one album to a new fan, it would be Awake. While their last few albums (except for some of Octavarium) have featured more emphasis on their impressive chops, Awake boasts great melodies to go along with their strong musicianship. \\"6:00\\" is a killer opening track that is carried by a chugging rhythm and awesome keyboard work by Kevin Moore. The tracks \\"Caught in a Web\\" and \\"Lie\\" both got some airplay on hard rock stations and are great songs as James Labrie's vocals shine on both while John Petrucci's wicked riffs and solos carry the latter. \\"Innocence Faded\\" is one of their best songs and features a great chorus, a catchy melodic guitar line, and a cool jam at the end. \\"Erotomania\\" is a strong instrumental with plenty of drama based on the main theme to keep you intrigued. From this point, the album is a whirlwind of emotions as \\"Voices\\" is full of bombast while \\"The Silent Man\\" is mellow and reflective. \\"Lifting Shadows of a Dream\\" is a strong ballad while \\"Scarred\\" changes tempos and stays exciting throughout its 11 minutes. \\"Space-Dye Vest\\" is a very emotional closer highlighted by its poignant vocals and Moore's somber piano lines. While all of Dream Theater's albums have something positive to offer, Awake is their best.
B004D7GU3M|1.0|When mastering an album you do a totally different mix for digital (ie, CD, mp3) and vinyl.  The reason for this is the different formats have different characteristics and matching your final mix to take advantage of them yields a superior listening experience.  In this case, no effort was made to produce a different mix for vinyl - as far as I can tell this is the digital master pressed onto a record.  Ironically, this has produced a release that sounds considerably WORSE than the CD.  If your main concern is audio fidelity avoid this release.  In fact, I can't even listen to it - after two plays it will never leave the package.  My digital copy sounds superior (which is a massive disappointment because I was dying to hear 'All of the Lights' on warm, rich vinyl).  I am incredibly disappointed considering this is one of the best albums I've heard in years and I'm frankly appalled that Kanye would sign off on this one after spending so much time crafting an amazing album.    As for the packaging, a lot of work went into the artwork, but no effort went into the materials.  The cardboard is flimsy, the vinyl is not heavyweight and for some inexplicable reason the artwork is censored.  It's just a painting and not even that suggestive - we better keep America's youth out of our many fine museums and art galleries as well lest they be exposed to anything thought provoking.      Album 5/5  Vinyl 0/5
B000AJIF4E|4.0|If you are used to $5 earbuds, these headphones will blow your mind. Since they deliver very high and low frequencies that earbuds cannot reproduce, and do not emphasize some frequencies wildly more than others, music sounds startlingly more lifelike through them. Their soundstage is much larger as well, so instruments are more separated and easier to hear.<br /><br />However, despite their many strengths and their sterling reputation in professional circles, the 7506s have a piercing resonance peak in the 10 khz region that renders them less suitable for fun listening. On quiet recordings where a single instrument is playing, this peak can make the headphones sound thrillingly \\"detailed\\". On busier recordings (especially poorly produced, wall-of-sound rock) the headphones can be quite fatiguing. On the worst recordings, it feels like someone is stabbing my eardrum with a tiny needle.<br /><br />These peaks can be equalized away. I found some suggested equalizer settings on a forum and adjusted them to my own tastes:<br /><br />10 khz, -3.5 dB, 0.14 bandwidth<br />4.3 khz, -3 dB, 0.3 bandwidth<br />200 hz, +2 dB, 0.3 bandwidth<br /><br />Voila! The hard edge is gone, and some other oddities (at 4.3 khz and 200hz) are evened out.<br /><br />As everyone's ears are different, one equalizer setting will not work for all. Some adjustment is needed.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final volume in the explosive Hunger Games series is an incredible, fast paced read. Just like \\"Catching Fire,\\" this book takes place practically immediately after the events of the previous volume, finding Katniss Everdeen with the rebels of the \\"lost\\" District 13.    With our heroes in their new underground environs the author presents a new mission: Can Katniss become the Mockingjay and ultimately defeat the evil administration of President Snow, ushering in a new era of peace and democracy? Will she recognize herself if she does? And what of Peeta and her tenuous feelings for him?    Pacing on this novel is just a little off, as it seems that the author had just a bit more to say about the characters than is evidenced here, though the detailed action sequences come fast and frequent. It's almost as if the author had more chronological time that she wanted to cover in this volume than in the previous two novels, leaving room for past characters to be fleshed out just a bit more but offering few new ones. The end is satisying but vague, leaving both a few loose ends and the reader wanting a bit more.    There's not specifically room for a sequel, but I for one would enjoy another volume in the Hunger Games series. 4 stars for this volume.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|When the season premiere  began, I told my mom what can season 8 do to top it up for it's last season. This may not be the 1# best season, but what a ending, I am so mad at the directors. Why can't you give Jack a break, after all he's been though, Why couldn't you give him a happy ending. The bad guys in this show was so stupid to kill renee, they were done.. She wasn't no threat. And that's when you saw jack as saying you cross the line, it may me and my mom kind a laugh seeing everyone worying about jack coming after them and actually crying. As for president taylor, What on earth was she doing, selling her soul to the devil. She let that snake Charles Logan in, & mess everything up for her. She would be the second best president next to David Palmer(which we all love). But I'm glad she made it right at the end and tim woods help her. Chloe, becoming head of CTU, Hastings at first mom & I thought we wouldn't like, but end up getting used to & wasn't so bad. Chloe, would she be up to it. I didn't even think of her taking over. Everyone was spectacular. The Hassan family as well. And don't ask me why, but I think Jason Pillar was pretty handsome.cute! So, there better be a 24 movie. I mean it. GIVE JACK BAUER A HAPPY ENDING THAT HE DESERVES.
B000FC2PKG|1.0|So convoluted that I ended up not even caring who did it.  For me, the author just through too many subplots in without really developing them.  Then she would go off on tangents describing minute details that added NOTHING to the plot.  Very disorganized and hard to get into.

The two people he wakes up next to, Pyper and Leo, claim to be his friends, but he has no recollection of who they are.<br /><br />When the group he's with arrives at the Grand Canyon, strange things start happening.  Jason has a run-in with Wind Spirits, but has no idea how he knows that's what they are.  During their life-and-death battle with the spirits, Coach Hedge, the teacher in charge who turns out to have goat legs, gets taken away by the creatures.  Shortly after, a girl and a group of followers show up on winged beasts and whisk them off to a place called Camp Half-Blood.<br /><br />The three soon discover that they are demigods.  Jason is the son of Zeus (but he keeps calling him Jupiter, Zeus' Roman name), Pyper is the daughter of Aphrodite, and Leo is the son of Hephaestus.  Still coming into their powers, the three are whisked away on a quest.  Their mission: find the missing Hera before the Giant King (the Greek gods' greatest enemy) raises a force so evil that mankind will be utterly doomed.<br /><br />The trio only has three days and has only one clue to go on: find Boreas, the god of the North Wind.  Will Pyper, Leo, and Jason be able to save the world?  Will Jason ever figure out who he really is?  Who really took his memories?  Why does he keep calling gods by their Roman names?<br /><br />A great new addition to the PERCY JACKSON & THE OLYMPIANS series.  The characters are well-developed, the plot is thick and mysterious, and the action is intense.  Although the story will make more sense once the reader has read the first five books in the original series, those who are fans of Rick Riordan, mythology, fantasy, and adventure will all enjoy reading THE LOST HERO.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Kira M
6305428425|5.0|Romy and Michele's High School Reunion is one of the funniest chick-flicks of all time. Just plain funny is it's claim to fame, and it is a movie I can watch again and again. Karmic debts are paid at the high school reunion from hell, where the nastiest of adolescent bitches have grown up to be much older bitches. They still live to judge all who do not meet their standards. The nerdiest of nerds has returned a triumphant millionaire. The baby-in-black angry chick reconnects with her tormenter, who confesses his love for her. Every pay-off you can imagine is acted out with players who are not much more than charicatures, but it's all great.<br /><br />Enter Romy and Michelle, desperate to show everyone that they have acheived great success, but the best they can come up with is that they are the inventors of post-it notes. (Duh.) Obviously, the truth comes out, lessons are learned, and there is the happiest of happy endings.<br /><br />If only my high school reunion had been this entertaining!
B0041KKYCY|2.0|I'm am only writing a review of this movie because it was directed independently Not a big budget Hollywood (lack of ideas), Remake! I'm a fan of old School campy, yet gory late 70's early to mid-80's Slasher films. I don't dig Torture films at all and feel it's to real life especially in these times! However, I liked the original \\"I spit on your grave\\", better than \\"Last House on the left\\", I thought the original Last house was kind of mean and too dark even for the time. I feel \\"I spit, was a time period piece and making more gore and more revenge in a New film was Not necessary. I like my Horror a little Campy and Silly yet very well acted. This film \\"The original\\" was an exploitation film not any more to it at the time. If your Not a fan of Exploitation and want a more serious version yet (I'm sure not as well acted because they used older more experienced actors and Actresses back then, then you might like this better. I was impressed with some of the reviews here for this movie! Very well written! I have a copy of this but saw the beginning and thought as I usually do; The actress is too young, It looks like it might be silly because of that fact. I'm a fan of Older Actors and Actresses player younger characters like in the 80's and then discovering a Molly Ringwald or John Cusack or Crispin Glover Etc. It made the films not just in the horror genre such Classics. For instance James Spader was 30 in \\"Pretty in Pink\\", Judd Nelson and Emilo were late 20's or 30 in \\"The breakfast Club\\" that was a directors secret at the time and made some Amazing films with great acting! So Going into this, if I do give it a try will be to see if the acting is good and if it's low on that and Camp, I may stick with the original. \\"Irreversible\\" was foul and disgusting shock. I like Horror movies. I guess in a a generation were we've been through wars and tougher times, young people want more torture and gore less plot or style? This was just a little exploitation film from the seventies that had a real tough subject matter. Film makers need to get more a creative stop making remakes, Please. Give the independent directors a chance at the Theaters and make some fresh stuff in the horror genre and put more backing behind it. 80's forever!.......Took a chance not a good movie, drags forever, male acting as bad as was in the Friday the 13th, Remake! Bad. Skip this one especially if your an exploitation/Horror fan it's just Not a good film. If your interested in the the story or original film get that one if not, look elsewhere! I watched the original twice and almost fell asleep during this. This doesn't hold a Candle.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|By far the most engrossing TV show I've ever watched. It is impossible to just watch one episode at a time, I'm hooked!
B003Y5UP44|5.0|I am surprised that other reviewers gave this movie such a poor rating. I thought it was very well made and the actors spot on for the parts. The costumes and setting looked authentic to me. Now, I am not a fan of the book, Jane Eyre. I read half of the book and couldn't finish it - the book dialogue was too \\"over the top\\" for me and Jane was simply too long suffering. This movie used much of the exact wording from the book, but a two hour movie was much easier for me to deal with. There is a new Jane Eyre movie coming out soon, but after looking a the trailer for it, I think this movie is a much better choice.
B002ZG99NG|1.0|Has all the trappings of a very good action/adventure/drama: excellent director/actor in Ben Affleck...John Hamm, Jeremy Renner. Interesting plot.  The whole thing is subverted by the absolute lack of a moral compass in the plot structure and characters.  We are supposed somehow to identify with Doug, a career criminal who, with his co-conspirators, rob banks, destroy property, put lives in jeopardy, kidnaps and terrorizes an innocent witness. Then, after accumulating all this money decides to leave \\"the town\\" with Claire and leave his life of crime.  Is it due to remorse over his antisocial, criminal life? Not hinted at.  Just tired of it.  I was actually angry as I left the theater, and cannot to this day understand how rational people think this film is so great. If you want great Ben Affleck, watch Gone Baby Gone.  Big thumbs down to this one (sorry, Roger Ebert for stealing your copyrighted phrase).
B003YFIUW8|5.0|This was my first Emma Donoghue novel...I am now a big fan. I have downloaded a few more of her novels I found on Amazon. I love the way she told this story from a child's point of view. While I was reading I could actually picture in my mind everything the little boy was describing in the room. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommended read.
0802473156|5.0|My then fiance and I read this book together before we got married. Actually, this was an assignment from our pastor who married us =;) It was very insightful and opened new lines of communication for both of us. We were so impressed we bought a copy for my sister. A must have for any couple no matter how strong the relationship is.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|this was a gripping tale that reached a climax about halfway through and still held me in its clutches.  It is emotional and tender, with characters who struggle with their limitations and rise above them.
B00447G2T8|4.0|It has taken a little longer than usual for this particular album to soak in for me. The songs are less melodic than Gambling With The Devil and there seems to be more emphasis on speed this time around. My favorite song on first listen was Who Is Mr Madman? I also like the lyrics to If A Mountain Could Talk. And I must say, Far Into The Future is one awesome song.    Not taking anything away from Helloween - I do think that Accept's monstrous release Blood Of The Nations, which came out about a month before this did, kind of put a shadow over anything else released for the remainder of 2010 and even into 2011 (see my review for Blood Of The Nations).     I love Helloween's music and 7 Sinners is no exception. After a few listens....four and a half stars. As a comparison, it only took one listen to the masterpiece Gambling With The Devil for it to earn a solid five stars. Rock on Pumpkinheads!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are a few books that come to mind that grab you and don't let you go. I knew this was one of those books within the first five minutes of picking it up. I read it in five consecutive hours, page turning with a sense of urgency I haven't felt in a while.   The book involves you on a very serious emotional level, you identify and sympathize with the characters immediately.
1588167461|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I am no \\"fashionista\\", and do not live around a major city here in the US, so I thought this would help me bone up on some good adult style choices. This book was both up to date without being extreme, and really allows for one to build a classic yet modern wardrobe without breaking the bank. LOTS of good advise here; particularly if you are struggling with making a style of your own.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay, like its predecessors in The Hunger Games series by Suzanne Collins, doesn't let you come up for air. Plot complications come one after the other until there's no putting the book down.  I found more than once I thought I knew how a scenario would play out only to find it didn't.<br /><br />That's because the characters are complex and believable. They are teen-agers and friends and sweethearts who live through incredible circumstances that cause them to do unthinkable things, and they win the reader's sympathy. Those emotional storms that blow through a normal adolescence move through theirs even as they make life-or-death judgments in a time of war.<br /><br />In the end, the novel illustrates how war--adult games at their basest--does more to rip apart interior landscapes of a society's most vulnerable members than it does to the real estate that becomes the battle ground.  In the end, isolation and reticence and a reluctance to look the truth squarely in the eye are the biggest obstacles to recovery.<br /><br />But Katniss Everdeen, Peeta Mellark, and Gale Hawthorne are three young people capable of looking at themselve and asking the big question of how much of their humanity they are willing to surrender to the whims of sadistic, greedy adults who have lost all sight of what it is to take heart and embrace life.<br /><br />If, when, and how these characters climb over the obstacles the despotic political players in their lives relentlessly throw at them is the story of Mockingjay.<br /><br />It will take your breath away.  Promise.
076790592X|3.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a very simple read, by that I mean the story line is very general in its morals even though it is about a complex, deep and sensitive matter. I thought before I bought it, the book would show more principles and wisdoms but it was very simple in its knowledge. This does not take anything away from Mitch Albom whose writing style gives a very easy and smooth read. It may help some to understand and overcome their similar positions or help others with similar positions. It is a story of struggles in facing death whilst reflecting on life. It looks at life and death as a two way mirror as a moral compass but shows you it may be too late to do this when you are old. The book may help some to start young in being wise and doing good when alive so the after life is good too.
B004GNYGTI|5.0|This was real intense!  You can see a woman doing the action thing and you don't often find that in a film.  Some of the things will just about make your jaw drop!
B00005JOFQ|1.0|In the years since I've seen this film I have held a quiet dislike for it that was hard for me to voice, particularly due to the fact that so many of my friends admire it.  It has much to like, I think: the acting, the pacing, the themes, cinematography, great story, etc.  However, as a gay man, my personal reaction to it was that it was disingenuous--that this film is not true to life, that it was incredible and unconvincing in that it does not agree with what I know to be true about love between people and love between men.    When two people love each other, and when that love is a great love, like the one depicted in this film, that love gives courage and enables the lovers to overcome certain obstacles, like fear.  In this movie that doesn't happen.  Mind you, it is not that I am addicted to happy endings.  I was not, at the outset, hoping for the two lovers to end up together and happy like in straight soap operas.  I expected them to be together because my own logic led me to that conclusion.  I thought, well, if their love is that great and strong, they'll find a way.  The love between the two men had that quality of greatness that, naturally, would lead me to think that way.  When that did not happen, and the men never really come together, never overcome their fear, it just didn't seem real or true to me.  Either their love was really not that great, or the story is lying at some level.    Let me tell you, when two closeted gay or bisexual men in their situation (married to women) fall in love, they can and do find ways to be together.  One of the most common ways of doing so is by going into business.  A business partnership between two men can become an unofficial marriage, granting the men ample time together and also many opportunities for traveling in each other's company for business related reasons and pretexts like: business conferences and fairs, meetings with investors, business expansion endeavors, etc.  Men in such a partnership can hope to enjoy a high degree of marital closeness, even though they have to be discreet about it.  Watching this film, I remember having the expectation that at some point the lovers would go into business together and manage to stay close to each other that way.    So, when the lovers do not come together, yes it was disappointing, and for a long time my mind searched for a reason why because the reasons given in the story were unconvincing--even untruthful.  And finally, I struck on what may be the answer--director Ang Lee's Chinese cultural background, with it's eastern philosophical tenets of individual self-sacrifice for the social order and a nebulous \\"greater good.\\"  Is the subtext here, I wondered, that gay love does not serve the \\"greater good,\\" and is the greater good equated with the social order and, by extension, mysteries? Sacredness? God?  You must admit, the characters possessed a great reluctance and fear to upset society.  The whole idea of a great love that existed but was not known nor acknowledged by anyone outside of the two lovers, is a concept that is very Asian--the lovers who cannot consummate their love because society forbids it, and that there is something spiritually beautiful in that abnegation of their love.  There are Chinese folktales that run like this, and it is this very type of romanticism that I find both disagreeable and dishonest.  Because the fact is that every single day, human beings have to find ways to subvert the social order in order to snatch some of the rewards of life for themselves, and they are also often successful in doing just that.  The failure of these lovers to do just that is incredible, untruthful, and dishonest, and does not serve any mysterious and deceptive \\"greater good.\\"    It is worth noting here that the lovers in the film are not cowboys by mere accident.  They are cowboys because the cowboy is one of the chief and most respected stereotypes of masculinity in America, and as such they make a convincing pitch for the heartstrings of those who believe in that stereotype, in John Wayne and the Marlboro man.  Imagine for a minute if the lovers in \\"Brokeback\\" had not been cowboys but instead had been truckers, or better yet, beauticians.  Could viewers have taken their love as seriously?  I don't think so.  The movie hinges on the idea that the cowboy-lovers are \\"real\\" men, and that it is the love between two \\"real\\" men that the story is about.  Why?  Well, to augment it's subtle but devastating insult to gay men.  It says to gay men that they are not men, that they are something less--because they do not conform to trite masculine stereotypes.  And the clincher is that the moviegoer is complicit in this insult because, if the movie had been about the love affair between two male hairdressers, far less people would have cared to see it.    I resent this movie because it represents a great put-down of gay men and of gay love.  It suggests that love between \\"real\\" men is not really possible, even as the \\"real\\" men in question are mere stereotypes.  It insults gay men by refusing to acknowledge their manhood.  It is ridiculous in it's belittlement of gay love because it suggests that even when that love is great, gay lovers are incapable of asserting and establishing that love and that closeness in some way, even subversively.  In the end, you may believe whatever you want to believe, but when men really love each other they find ways to be together, whether they are closeted married cowboys or high-powered businessmen.  And the social order be damned.
B00406UK7S|2.0|Centurion passes on the old myth of the disappearance of the 9th legion after it marched north into Scotland.  In fact there are records of the 9th after the period of the movie.  It apparently was stationed on the Rhine where it was probably lost due to attrition. The inspiration for the movie is an old children's book.  The myth of the 9th legion is popular in England and Scotland for obvious reasons.  And the fearsome female Pict warrior seems more based more on anime films than any historic precedent.  The acting was good, but I never believed this script for a minute.  If I wanted to see false British history, I'd watch a King Arthur film.
B0042816YK|5.0|I loved this movie in the theater; I couldn't wait for this to come to DVD and I can't stop watching it!

B004G600A4|5.0|I will admit that I am a Disney sap, but Tangled is perhaps the best movie of 2010, or even this millenium. The characters are great, well developed, and fun. The art is beautiful. The story is a twist on the classic that everyone knows so well.     And then it happens. Mid movie. You'll know it when you see it. That piece of Disney Magic that you know no other creators could make. That scene that was written just to touch your heart. Your eyes light up, you might get a little teary even though it isn't sad... It's just magic.    Tangled is fantastic. I preordered it. I saw it in theatres 8 times. I bought the soundtrack.     I don't do that with movies that aren't amazing. In fact... I've never done that before in my life.    Buy this movie. It doesn't matter if you're one or 100, you'll love it.

0446195529|2.0|My First Camel Club book!!!  Oliver Stone??@*#   Never name your main character after someone known and/or living. I kept seeing this 'Oliver Stone', as a puggish faced rotund guy with black receding hair, wondering if Sheen or Beringer would be showing up!     Anyway, first chapter, our hero is kidnapped by some tough guys...or at least allows himself to be. Second chapter, they take him to see the President, who all alone and by hinself, recruits Oliver Stone (\\"I'm to old for this\\"),to go against a Russian drug/gov't drug cartel...and it appears the Pres is driectly running the op! Next 3-4 chapters build up the British PM's attempted assassination in Lafayette Park (across from the White House), hence (I guess) Hells Corner.    By now, I've left the scene of the crime...my last and only Camel Club book. Two stars, as I did not finish this boring story...out of respect to a well known writer.
B00026ZG10|5.0|This movie is an incredible funny movie. Arnold and Jamie Lee make a wonderful team.  I would definitely recommend this movie to be added to your collection.
0307719774|5.0|Love this journal. I am super busy with two kids and I rarely have time to collect a thought, much less right a journal entry. This little book is perfect. Each day there is a different question. Some funny, clever and even thought provoking, on a deeper level. I have actually been able to keep up each day and I have found it to be really fun. The best part is this is a 5 year journal so you can look back and see what you said each year. This would make a great gift for anyone.
B003VR5PPY|3.0|One thing noteworthy about 999 is that it's about 80% visual novel, so interaction is pretty limited. Basically, come into this game expecting to read lots and lots of text, some of it baffling and seemingly unrelated to what's going on. While I did end up completing 4/6 endings and plan on finishing the rest, I would've been a LOT less frustrated and willing to quit if I had known this going in. One thing I can't overlook however, are the puzzles - excluding one box-related puzzle, they were ridiculously easy (at least, for me). In fact, many can be solved by simply tapping things with your stylus until the characters figure it out themselves. That being said, I wouldn't say the game is a waste of time. Patience pays off as some of the unlockable endings are downright disturbing and combining items to bypass tricky situations is pretty fun. If you have a soft spot for horror and don't mind slogging through text, the payoff is well worth it.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|This book was far better than I had expected. It was recommended to me by a friend and this book contained so much useful information that I have been even referenced it in some of my college papers. All the information presented in the book is done so with great care, detail, and a bit of humor. It's an approach to transforming oneself with and without the scientific jargon. The \\"Slow Carb Diet\\" in the book has been instrumental in my own successes and I still continue to adhere to it. The 4-Hour Body has definitely transformed me and I definitely recommend it as a \\"must-read\\" for all.
0143038583|4.0|This book was one of the reasons I began farming. [[ASIN:0983271704 The Accidental Farmers: An urban couple, a rural calling and a dream of farming in harmony with nature]] is where my own story is described. Food choices in America, as Pollan eloquently points out, is...well, a complex matter. Like politics, there are those on each side of the spectrum. On the one end is the industrial food system, which has managed to increase yields, production and products to such a degree that we produce FAR more calories than we need. On the other end is the local, so called sustainable food system, the end that I'm largely on. I say \\"largely\\" because I'm still a part of the industrial empire.<br /><br />The important take aways from this book for me was the knowledge I gained about corn, how it's produced, dissected and reassembled into so many constituent ingredients for common products. There's just no escaping it. Of course, many people get caught up in the argument \\"can organic/sustainable feed the world?\\", etc. I believe the answer is, of course, yes, since it did for thousands of years. Can it feed an unlimited number of humans? No, but that becomes a population growth issue relative to resources.<br /><br />This book is an eye-opener. It's absolutely worth reading so that you can think through your views, your values, and make the food choices that are right for you.
B004G6009U|4.0|I saw Tangled in the theater in 3-D.  That may have been a slight mistake as it does wash out the color impact of the film but I do appreciate how far 3-D technology has come.    While Tangled was probably a very smart balancing act between emotional depth and quick-paced breezy comedy to keep the kid's attention I left the theater feeling there was a missed opportunity.  Although there is probably a strong cross-pollination between DreamWorks and PIXAR now, I'd love to know what a PIXAR screenplay could have looked like.  Something darker, maybe even Shakespearian (with an up-beat ending), could have created a true CGI classic (although Toy Story 3 was getting close).      The simple incorporation of some true emotional problems experienced by anyone locked in a tower for 18 years by a self-serving witch could have been a step off in a totally different direction... but, yes, it's hard to sell dolls that way.  If Mother Gothel in the original story was a kind of witch-for-hire then what if Rapunzel were a witch-for-hire-in-training?  This would be her excuse to have a mission to leave the tower, even if it wasn't technically authorized.  Madcap mayhem, cold terror, and redemptive love would ensue.    While comparisons with Aladdin, Little Mermaid, and Beauty and the Beast, are obvious and relevant, this was in many ways a much more intimate film.  The entire film was based around the initially divergent interests of three people, and other than a very short production number in a bar and an equally short and spontaneous dance in the village square there were no big crowd scenes having to do with oddly dancing to choreography or carrying pitch forks and torches.      Unfortunately it's hard to appreciate the subtleties of all aspects of the animation in one viewing pass and there are certainly things to appreciate in Tangled that can easily be missed the first time around.  That's why they invented DVD's.
B000BTJDGC|4.0|The Exorcism of Emily Rose leaves many unanswered questions for me, especially how the possession occurred in the first place.  However, the film does a fair job of telling a true story without unnecessarily dramatizing or sensationalizing it.  The accompanying CD is quite interesting.  It is a documentary with interviews by exorcists and psychologists as well as footage of real life exorcisms.  It's almost worth ordering it just for that.
030746363X|5.0|No matter what you are looking for in changing your body, the 4hour body can help. If you are looking to gain muscle mass in a short time, there's an section for that. If you are looking for sustainable weight loss with an easy to follow diet, there's a section for that. If you are looking to fill out your tush, there's a section for that. And if you are looking to be more skillful in bed, there's a section for that too.    Plus, everything in the book has been well researched and tested out on the author and in most cases, multiple human guinea pigs, so you can rest easy in knowing what Tim recommends is not just pure theory or based on limited data.     I cannot recommend this book enough.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|I have been waiting to get these movies on bly-ray. Finally got them and I am very happy. They look great on blu-ray. Although, upon arrival, it seemed like something heavy was set on my package and the Ocean's 12 case was damaged. The actual blu-ray worked fine. I don't blame that on the seller. Blu-rays are great and it's is also a great price. Less that Wal-Mart and Target.

B0015DROBO|3.0|Ok, over hyped.  Fun, brainless read, but I really can not understand the hype.  Would not recommend for a serious literature fan, but perhaps for someone that seeks out books by Robert Ludlum or John Grisham, then this will do just fine.  Someone that likes an Emmy movie will enjoy this, but don't expect an Oscar caliber performance (well, ok, those can be politically chosen, but are rarely bad performances).  You get the picture.  I have the other two, because I am obsessive about finishing series, but I am not expecting much.  Basically, buy and read if you want some light weight entertainment.

B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|It can be painful watching some rock bands get old, and their material get progressively weaker and weaker.  Aerosmith is one band that musically stopped being relevant immediately after \\"Done With Mirrors\\" and decided to regurgitate \\"Toys In The Attic\\" for the remainder of their career, the back half truly embarrassing for fans of the '70's era.  KISS are simply getting too old for this game as their music too has suffered, although not as bad as Aerosmith.<br />  Which brings us to Motorhead.  Lemmy Kilmister is 65 rocking years old and hasn't slowed down one damn bit.  Motorhead remain prolific and release Cd's of pure heavy rock and roll nirvana on probably the most consistent level of any long term band.  Call it metal, thrash or extremely loud rude rock and roll, or as I prefer, Motorhead music.  After all, nobody makes music quite like Motorhead, though there's no telling how many bands have tried.  Likewise, the number of bands influenced by Motorhead are incalculable.  Sodom and High On Fire recall the fire of the early days, but few others get within ballpark range.<br />  \\"The World Is Yours\\" is a CD I practically knew what would sound like before I got it unwrapped.  I wasn't disappointed, and you won't be, either.  With the dedication and love they put into their music, no formula twisting is necessary.  Only through 35 years of an immense catalogue can we see the evolution from the earliest original lineup to today's, the longest lasting one featuring Phil Campbell and Mickey Dee on guitar and drums.  Like recent releases, \\"The World Is Yours\\" is stripped down, loud and inspires the listener to stand up for himself and not be a pushover for anybody.  \\"Rock And Roll Music\\" is not the Chuck Berry classic, although I'd like to see it given the Motorhead treatment.<br />  To put it short, you either love Motorhead or you don't.  This CD won't blow your mind, but you'll get exactly what you came for, a great kick ass rock and roll album.  Can't argue with that, can you?um.   Can't argue with that, can you?

B00013RC8O|4.0|The 70's was a time of confusion, unrest, and rebellion that saw many Americans questioning some of the basic tenants of society.  With some similarities to Easy Rider (1969), director Richard C. Sarafian`s Vanishing Point (1971), features a daring driver in a white Dodge Challenger hitting the open highways in a quest for freedom, cruising at high speeds, staying just ahead of the law.  Along the way, a few facts about the man behind the wheel are revealed, gradually filling in some of the details about his colorful past.<br /><br />An ex-professional race driver, Kowalski (Barry Newman) now makes his living delivering cars from one place to another.  Picking up a supercharged Challenger with Colorado plates OA-5599 in Denver on a Friday night, Kowalski intends to arrive in San Francisco by Sunday afternoon.  Early on in the approximately 1300 mile journey, Kowalski refuses to pull over for the state police, and then spends the rest of the film on the run from the highway patrol of several states.<br /><br />Barry Newman's understated performance brings some sensitivity to a character who appears cool, sexy, and likeable, even though he is an outlaw of sorts, and at times recklessly endangers the lives of others with his maniacal driving.  Fueled by uppers, and driven by forces unknown, Kowalski eludes the cops, leaving a trail of disabled vehicles in his wake.  Reaching the open highway, he rips through vast desert expanses and western prairie country, trying to remain free.<br /><br />Along the way, Kowalski meets some interesting individuals who help him to continue on his journey.  Veteran character actor Dean Jagger plays a snake hunting prospector, while Angel (Timothy Scott) is an easy riding free spirit, who provides both drugs and much needed aid, at a critical juncture.  Paul Koslo is a highway patrol officer who takes a very personal interest in the chase.  By far the most quirky character is a blind radio disc jockey named Super Soul, played by Cleavon Little.  Identifying with Kowalski's defiance of authority, Super Soul tries to aid him on his journey, however not everyone is pleased when his broadcasts bring Kowalski's exploits to a public stage.<br /><br />Vanishing Point is an offbeat joyride that is a blast while it lasts, although the longer things go, the smaller the chances for a favorable outcome become.  Well structured, the story unfolds nicely, with Barry Newman giving a terrific performance, rarely seeming to lose his way.  Much is communicated without words, as his main costar is often the Challenger.  Flashbacks are employed to reveal critical elements from Kowalski's past.  By the end of the film, he still remains mostly an enigma, but enough is revealed to piece together some picture of the man.<br /><br />The music featured in the film, a combination of funk, rock, country, gospel, and soul, is a major contributor to the movie's footloose vibe.  Very much a reflection of the times, the film examines a particular slice of Americana, and one man's attempt to find peace of mind and freedom, in what is a precursor to the Smokey and the Bandit type pursuit films that would soon follow.<br /><br />The DVD includes both the American (99 minute) and British (106 minute) versions of the film.  The British version is the one to see, as it contains some additional scenes, primarily one where Kowalski picks up a hitchhiker played by English actress Charlotte Rampling.  A terrific bonus is a commentary track by director Richard C. Sarafian, which is very down to earth, and full of fascinating, sometimes risqu&eacute; stories, and warm remembrances regarding the film that is not to be missed.ng with Kowalski's defiance of authority, Super Soul tries to aid him on his journey, however not everyone is pleased when his broadcasts bring Kowalski's exploits to a public stage.

B002SF9YNO|4.0|This is a film that I had intended to watch for a long time but kept on postponing. As I have consistently heard great reviews, I finally watched it and I was not disappointed. The story is about a cello player who has recently lost his job as cellist because the orchestra went bankrupt. To make ends meet, he has to move back to his hometown and ends up taking up a job as a Nakanshi, the people who prepare the dead for the funeral. Metaphorically rich, there are several themes in this wonderful film, such as going back home, making peace with one's past, death and dying, value and dignity of human life, the career of your dream may not be the one that you may end up pursuing, family support, value of life and many more.<br />In many ways this movie is flawless and like all great movies makes you think and ponder. The main character is a cellist and the musical pieces that accompany the film are great and have been used effectively to propel the story forward. `Departures' is a film that you will love to watch again.

Once you read this book you will become completly obsessed and won't be able to stop. Then you will know what I am talking about. These books ARE pain. They ARE struggle. They ARE love, hate,betrail, and kill. I read the series and spent my whole weekend in hysterics. The story inspired me to be more than me, and make something of myself. Then they killed off most of the characters I fell in love with and riped the books from under my feet. I'm going through a depretion spiral. Then when you hear the music, Rue's lullaby and the hanging tree, on youtube or the soundtrack....something clicks and you'll never be the same again. Three weeks after I was done I was watching TV and it was on a commercail when my sister (who didnt read the books) went on youtube and looked up the books. She played Rue's lullaby and almost immediatly I began to get misty eyed. As I began to assened the stairs I heard the phrase \\"This is the place where I love you\\" slip through my covered ears and the hysterics began. These books will completly change YOU. You'll never look at anything the same way again. For better for worse they get stuck inside you....clawing away at your insides until you can't stand it and break into tears.       Best book ever....NEVER READ IT!

B00005JKLZ|2.0|Herbert George Wells (H.G. Wells) along with Jules Verne was one of the pioneers in the genre that would become science fiction.  The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, and The War Of The Worlds, are among Wells' most famous stories.  Produced by George Pal, the film version of [[ASIN:B000AOEMWS The War of the Worlds (Special Collector's Edition)]] (1953) starring Gene Barry, became a science fiction classic, and won an Academy Award for special effects.  Pal produced and directed the 1960 version of [[ASIN:0790747324 The Time Machine]], featuring Rod Taylor, which also became a sci-fi classic, and likewise won an Oscar for best special effects.<br /><br />This update of The Time Machine (2002) was directed by Simon Wells, the great-grandson of H. G. Wells.  While featuring some of the key elements from the 1960 film, including the iconic sled-like time machine, and a trip into the future where the Eloi and Morlocks inhabit the earth, the similarities are mostly superficial, as the story undergoes a mass reworking that emphasizes adventure, romance, and special effects.<br /><br />Guy Pearce (The Proposition) is Alexander Hartdegen, a mechanical engineer interested in theories involving time travel.  When his fianc&eacute;e Emma (Sienna Guillory) is tragically killed, Hartdegen devotes his life to developing a time machine to go back into the past, change what occurred, and save Emma's life.  Amazingly, Hartdegen successfully travels back in time, but his spirit is crushed when despite his efforts, Emma perishes again, only in a different manner.<br /><br />Still seeking a way to successfully change the past, Alexander travels into the future, and after several stops, he winds up in the year 802,701.  There he is taken in by people known as the Eloi, who live in an area that was once New York City.  Hartdegen is under the care of Mara (Samantha Mumba) and her brother Kalen (Omero Mumba).  When the Eloi are surprise attacked by the Morlocks, creatures who live underground, Mara is captured and dragged below the sands.  There in a strange subterranean kingdom ruled by the Uber-Morlock (Jeremy Irons), Hartdegen has a strange and dramatic confrontation that settles his fate.<br /><br />This remake of The Time Machine is a slick, big budget science fantasy adventure with ample special effects that although driven by romance, somehow doesn't have much of a heart, and is largely founded on pretentious nonsense.  Apparently all the events in the future, depend on Emma's death spurring Hartdegen's efforts at time travel.  Even if you buy that premise, with a future so bleak, it's hard to conceive that there are no better options.  Still, if man is even around in the year 802,701 perhaps any kind of existence might be welcome.  Alexander Hartdegen is inconsistent, written as something of a dandy who never gets his clothes dirty, who occasionally gets courageous.  The whole freaky Uber Morlock storyline complete with Jeremy Irons in whiteface and Hartdegen's watch collection, with the muddled mess of an ending, than features the apparent annihilation of  an entire race, is just silly.  Not to mention the holographic librarian played by Orlando Jones (MadTV), who somehow still has a source of power 800,000 years later.  The special effects are at times impressive, but not very believable.  The same also goes for the rubbery suited Morlocks.<br /><br />This version of The Time Machine is mildly entertaining, but is not particularly memorable, and not an effort that many would regard as being close to the same class as the original.d dragged below the sands.

B003Y5H4SY|3.0|M. Night Shyamalan takes a break from direction and writes this story about five people in an elevator one of which happens to be the devil.  Comprising entirely of fresh faces, there are many hooks in this story to keep us engrossed. The characters were believable and the drama is mostly about these people in an elevator, which is stuck between floors. The storm clouds gathering over Philadelphia added to the creepy atmosphere. Three stars. 1/27/11
0670022411|4.0|I was initially drawn to this book because Deborah Harkness is one of my favorite historians, and because of the premise of a historian working on alchemical texts at the Bodleian library.  I was initially expecting a sort of \\"historical mystery\\", and I should \\"warn\\" readers that this book is definitely not that. It is much more about witches and vampires, magic and  relationships - but  while history is certainly a part of it, it is not at the center of the book. At least not yet. Another quick warning is that while I found the book very satisfying, it is evidently a setup for a sequel, because the central problems of the book are not solved at the end of it. That being said, however, the story itself is so complex and rich that I most certainly did not feel cheated at the end of it.     So, overall my impression is quite positive. Now here's a more detailed explanation:     As a historian myself, I greatly enjoyed  Harkness' remarkably accurate descriptions of archival work and archival research. Some commenters here have called it \\"academic nonsense\\", but I found the description very real and true to life. After a series of books and movies that described the work of historians as some sort of action movie involving running around in ancient caves, being chased by murderers etc. - it was nice to read a description of the historian's work that actually rang true to life.     Then as the book progressed, I got a little worried. It definitely followed many of the classic cliches of vampire and sorcerer literature, including a witch who is uniquely powerful yet knows little about her powers, and a vampire who is ancient, gorgeous, brilliant and fabulously wealthy. There were parts in the first half of the book where I was worried that it would be a kind of \\"twilight for adults\\", complete with an overprotective vampire and a female heroine who submits to his commanding nature too easily. These fears lasted until about half-way through the book. Even so, I still enjoyed it because it was well written and had some complex and interesting ideas about history, science etc.     And then, at about the half-way point, the book took a dramatic turn for the better. First, the plot went up a few levels of interest and complexity. Second, the various threads of history, science etc. which before had seemed a little bit like \\"showing off\\" began to finally tie together into the plot in a way that made sense. Third, the relationship between Diana and Matthew finally began to be more equal, with Diana proving herself a true, complete and full heroine (no more flashbacks to \\"twilight\\" here!). Even the sexy romance stuff, often a weakness in a lot of these books, were moderate in quantity and exceptionally well written.     As the book drew to a close I found it increasingly difficult to put it down, and when I reached the end I felt at once that it was good, well rounded ending - and that I really wanted to read a future sequel. Especially taking into account the fact that (without giving too many spoilers) it is very likely to take more advantage of Harkness' talents as a historian.     So, overall I would say that while this book is not perfect, I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good supernatural story, especially one that is richer and more intelligent than the usual drivel in this genre. I would also say - if somewhere in the middle you get a bit worried that this is just your average vampire romance, stick with it. It will be reward the continued reading.    Quick update:   I've noticed several reviewers complaining that they were expecting a romance novel and this wasn't it. Let me make it clear: this book is (thankfully) not a romance novel. It is a novel which, among other things, involves a romance. However, the romance is by no means \\"hot and heavy\\" and this book is absolutely not a romance novel. If what you are looking for is a romance novel, look elsewhere.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|You can write with a focus on good science fiction, or you can focus on writing a good story that contains science fiction. This series of Doctor Who is the latter. As a lifelong Doctor Who fan who likes a good story first, I rate this as Best of the Best. Besides a science finction story, it is a children's story, a love story, a fairytale, and an inspirational story. I would also recommend it as a place with which to introduce someone to the series who has seen little or no previous Doctor Who . It stands very well on its own. Each episode is distinct but also tied together with a common thread that, unlike some other series, is well resolved in the final episode (I'm talking to YOU, Battlestar Galactica writers!).     The soundtrack is also above and beyond any adjectives this reviewer can summon.    A few minor negative points, just to be critical:  - The box came apart as other reviewers have mentioned. The plastic holding the stack of discs comes separated from the outer box. But holograms are cool, so we'll let that slide.  - The audio balance of the DVD opening screens and the show itself is way off (the opening being far too loud). In a few cases the music was too loud in the show relative to the dialog.  - You've left any future writers of the series pretty well screwed to do better. GERONIMO!
0375850864|2.0|This book was very well written and entertaining--until the ending which was one of the biggest disappointments I've experienced in the fiction world; to put it mildly, a piece of crap which canceled out the book's other positive attributes!!  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1401310400|4.0|I'm a fan of the \\"Castle\\" on TV, and this related collateral material was obviously written by the writers as a fantasy version of Richard Castle's books - same titles, same characters (Rook instead of Castle), same backstory, etc.    The biggest difference is that \\"Rook\\" gets into the detective's pants, which Castle fantasizes about (and well he might - Stana Katic is a total fox).    All things considered, I like it - a clever way to promote the show, and not a bad book on a standalone basis.
0316044695|2.0|It was hard to get over the endless SEAL hype and liberal bashing.   Marcus Luttrell is not a deep thinker, by his own admission.   He's a super-trained Texas=loving soldier that just wants to be unleashed on whatever he's pointed at.    His talk about Rules of Engagement is poorly thought out, since he also was saved by a local village.  Seems like this whole mission was poorly conceived and it calls into question the abilities of the planners and strategic thinkers.  This \\"holy and righteous\\" USA war is going badly and we'll leave there just like the Russians did, with nothing to show for it.
B0000E64TR|5.0|I first purchased this as a vinyl recording back in 1973.  I enjoyed it then and even went to the concert tour.  Elton was just at his finest hour during this period of time. I put away the record and pretty much forgot about it. When Princess Dianna died Elton remade candle in the wind. Even this rendition was good. I swore to myself I would NOT  duplicate my catalogue of records when CDs came about. Well  I just had to have this recording after hearing Elton again playing with Leon Russell.  I am very happy to have this in my CD collection, Again this was Elton's finest work!  Do NOT pass this one up......
0670022411|3.0|I really enjoyed the first 75% of the book. Yes, the author did get bogged down in repetitious details... the decriptions of Diana's sad wardrobe, what she ate or didn't eat, attending yoga classes, tedious descriptions of the Oxford University complex, and so on. I also agree with another reader's comments that Diana seemed totally immature and helpless, especially for someone who is an expert in ancient medical text and alchemy, fluent in multiple languages, and has a PhD. One could understand this if her character was a cloistered, nerdy academic, but she turns out to be the babe of the millenium for our handsome, intelligent alpha vampire Matthew Clairmont.    On the plus side, I really enjoyed the book's premise that all of the earth's creatures (humans, vampires, witches, daemons) could share some ancient genetic link. During her adademic research in one of the Oxford libraries, Diana stumbles upon a magically protected book that may contain secrets vital to saving the creatures from extinction. Approaching our interaction with non-human creatures from a scientific point of view is an interesting perspective on which to base the story.    On the minus side, the romantic scenes were tepid. Did Diana and Matthew ever \\"do it\\"? To me, it seemed they did everything but... I don't need explicit detail, but I do need to feel that there is a real passion between the main characters, and it just wasn't there. The last 25% of the book dealt with Diana and Matthew going back to the States to stay with her aunts. Once again, no passion, no danger, and it verged on being Harry Potter-esqe.... the house growing additional rooms if company was expected, the house spewing out lost family artifacts whenever it felt the urge, the house needing to get to know the visitors or strange things may happen.... this was a really juevenile concept and illustrated the biggest problem of the book... the author lost focus.    Will I run out and buy the second book at soon as it comes out?No. Unless, the author really injects some excitement into this story and remembers what makes paranormal romance books sell (blood, sex, romance, mystery), then I'll just wait to purchase the paper-back when it goes on sale.    Pet peeve - why do people use the book reviews to complain about Kindles prices? This is quite annoying. Please contact Amazon customer service or another appropriate department to vent your dissatisfaction. This is not the place to do it.
0670022411|5.0|This is a completely engaging story of witches, vampires and demons, and it is so much more. It leads the reader to muse on the origins of life, on the meaning of science, of the psychological motives for love, war, and everything in-between. All the while, the author reveals fascinating snippets of times long past with humor and effortless grace. All this and a kick-ass heroine makes for one of those books that I not only couldn't put down, but kept mulling over for days.     Most of the 1-star reviews (unfairly) complain about the Kindle price, not the book's content; I hate Kindle books over $9.99, but at nearly 600 pages, this is one e-book that is worth the extra $5.
0307593525|5.0|Like many people in my age group, I hadn't heard of Julia Child until I saw the movie \\"Julie and Julia.\\" It was a big surprise to me to read the book that the film was based upon and to have my enthusiasm utterly muted by that work. While that book was less than stellar, it certainly turned my attention to the Grand Dame of cooking: Mrs. Julia Child.<br /><br />What a legend she had become! As I came to study her life over the past year I became more and more interested in cooking. My daily schedule not only encouraged this interest but my budget required it! This past Christmas my parents gave me this boxed set, and I have hardly put it down in the past two months. I ALWAYS have something cooking now, and thanks to Julia I haven't had a single recipe fail. Well... except lady fingers, but I botched a few steps in my haste which was completely my fault. While learning to make poulet a l'estragon, and gnocchi aux sauce mornay (among dozens of other things) I have found in food what Julia found; sheer joy.<br /><br />While I started my gastronomic journey many months before I got these books, they have simply acted as the key that unlocked the door to my happiness. I can't tell you how much fun I've had following Julia's words, and kneading dough for french bread, and shaping puff pastry, and whipping cream into creme chantilly! She has given unto this world easily accessible recipes for heaven on a plate. While reading these books, and her autobiography 'My Life in France' I have felt impressed to follow her footsteps by entering the culinary industry. I am applying for admittance to Le Cordon Bleu right now, and prospects look good.<br /><br />Thank you Julia for sharing not only your recipes with us, but also your life, and your sense of joy in these pages. They have certainly changed my life.
1856697061|5.0|This book (along with the first volume) may be the best references I have ever seen for innovative, ground-breaking design and pattern-making I've ever seen.  Tomoko Nakamichi is a genius!!  With that said, this book is definitely not for the novice or timid patternmaker---you definitely need to know what you are doing before tackling any of the ideas in this book.

B00361DR4Q|4.0|I thought the production was very good.  Staging was different from those familar with Met-based Operas.  Unfortunately there is, I guess, a bad spot on my disc.  The third act had several freezes.  My equipment skipped over them, but it detracted from my enjoyment.  Since I didn't open it until after the return period expired, I can't send it back for an exchange.  Don't delay watching it after you get it.  If I had a good copy it would be a terrific deal and well worth it.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|is one of those movies where you aren't really given a direct story line to follow up front.  You sort of have to piece it together as you go along.  And as the layers to the plot are discovered, you have a good laugh and lots of fun and surprises along the way.<br /><br />Bruce Willis plays Frank Moses, an ex CIA agent whose file has been stamped RED - Retired, Extremely Dangerous.  He lives a quiet life on a quiet street, ripping up his pension check just so he can call in and speak to the lovely Sarah Ross (Mary-Louise Parker) at the Pension office.  They talk about books and traveling, and then Frank's house gets shot up by the bad FBI guys.  Frank kicks butt and gets the heck out of there.<br /><br />After picking up Sarah, who might find herself in trouble with the CIA just for talking to him, he sets out to find why he's suddenly become a target.  Along the way, he reconnects with some old, but deadly, colleagues played by Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren. Together, they find out the black-ops are out to kill a list of people who were present in Guatemala when the now Vice President committed war crimes.  With his plan to run for President, he needs to get rid of some dirty laundry, and Frank's name is on the laundry list.<br /><br />John Malkovich is superb as a crazed gunman who fears everyone is out to get him - the government, the web, the satellites, the helicopters flying over. The government tests involving daily injections of LSD back in the day didn't help much!  The gun chases are over the top hilarious thanks to John, his big guns, and classic one liners!<br /><br />Morgan Freeman is...well, Morgan Freeman who never disappoints.  But Helen Mirren, a bread-and-breakfast flowering arranging, meal planning, elder is also a deadly assassin who loves to kill people.  She's also in love with their Russian adversary who has always wanted to kill a U.S. President, played by highly versatile Brian Cox.<br /><br />This is a movie not intended to be taken too seriously.  The big guns and big explosions often had me laughing out loud at times because the characters take the action very seriously, and you can't help but laugh at the old Western-like face offs. See this movie for the unbelievable cast, and for its hilarity.<br /><br />Bruce Willis followers won't be disappointed, although Bruce's character is a bit reserved this time. There's not a lot of classic emotional connection in the storyline between you and the characters or with between the characters themselves, but that's okay.  You'll still walk away like you've just had a great day at an amusement park.<br /><br />I'd give it 4 stars for entertainment value, 4 stars for action, and 3 stars for writing and plot.s and big explosions often had me laughing out loud at times because the characters take the action very seriously, and you can't help but laugh at the old Western-like face offs.

B0006B2A42|5.0|I love this movie!<br /><br />The acting is first-rate.  I was never a fan of Rock Hudson, but was very pleasantly surprised at his performance in this movie.  However, Patrick McGoohan, one of my favorite actors, stole this movie. His character was so calm cool and collected until that great scene in which he explodes with a diatribe that ends with \\"Just get me there!\\" The way McGoohan delivers those lines is superb.<br /><br />It's also a movie that keeps one guessing about who the good guys are, and the final showdown is a nail biter. I don't think I took a breath until it was over.<br /><br />I saw where someone said it's a good \\"guy movie,\\" but it's also a great movie for us females who like a well-written, well-acted and well-directed movie, even an action-adventure one.<br /><br />I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see what a really good movie looks like.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I really did like this movie and hope it wins at Academy Awards.  I liked it  so much, I watched it twice.Back to back evenings!

B0015DROBO|5.0|My husband bought me my Kindle for Christmas and purchased this book as a sample to try out as far as down loading to the Kindle etc. I started reading The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and could not put it down. As soon as I finished the book I went and bought the Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest. These were the best books I think I have EVER read. It is 2 months later and I am still thinking about Lizbeth Salander. OMG what a character. I have never written a review about a book before but these books made such an amazing impact on me I had to share my opinion. I am so disappointed that these are the only 3  books Stieg Larsson wrote because he is an amazing author. I promise you if you read the Girl With the Dragon Tattoo you won't be able to stop there. You will race to purchase the other two novels.
B00150B2SS|5.0|How do I begin to tell you about Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, by John LeCarre except to tell you that I've read it for pleasure numerous times and that you may want to also - or at least once or twice.    What's it about?  In Spanish translation the book's title is El Topo (The Mole) because the British secret spy service, \\"the Circus,\\" is failing, and some believe that a bright young man, secretly a communist, has signed up with the Service out of college and has worked his way up to senior vice-president level, at which height he has begun to sabotage the Circus's major initiatives.  Missions are unsuccessful, valuable foreign networks of spies are being exposed, imprisoned, and shot, and the Circus is losing the respect of the intelligence services of friendly countries with whom they might trade secrets.  Anyone at the Circus who suggests that there may be a deep penetration agent inside the agency is fired on the grounds that pointing fingers without evidence is detrimental to the morale of the enterprise.    However, in the early chapters of the book a low-level agent on a low-level mission accidentally discovers strong evidence of the existence of such a mole.  (These few chapters which tell of the agent Tarr and his mission and discovery are in themselves fascinating reading, and are about as close to a Micky Spillane thriller as the methodical LeCarre has ever written.)  Tarr's mid-level boss with whom he shares the evidence is wise enough not to inform the Circus superiors of it, but takes it to the Ministry office that oversees the agency.  In turn, the Ministry secretly calls upon George Smiley (recently a senior v.p. of the Circus but fired for voicing the possibility of a double agent), and persuades him to follow up, test the evidence, and lay some trap to expose the mole.  Although the innocents at the top level of the Circus will be unaware of Smileys mission, the mole would know that Tarr has briefly exposed him; therefore Tarr feels himself to bein extreme danger, as will be Smiley and his team if the mole gets wind of the investigation.    The tremendous emotional punch of the book comes from the story of Jim Prideaux's betrayal as a means of protecting the mole.  Sent to a winter hunting lodge in Czechoslovakia to meet secretly with a discontented general, he is ambushed, shot, imprisoned, and eventually sold back to England a not-quite-broken man.  You meet Jim in Chapter One; his greater story comes further on, and I promise you will never forget it. This is LeCarre, a former secret agent, writing about the life, its tradecraft, self-doubt, realities, and courage.    Smiley must secretly look people up and gently interrogate them about Prideaux's betrayal.  In one lighter chapter Smiley gets the recollection of sports writer and part-time secret agent Jerry Westerby, who bought some beers for a young private in the Czech army and his girl and their friends at a lively bar and came away feeling that Prideaux's betrayal was orchestrated by Moscow,... and was seriously chastised for reporting that to the Circus.  Several others tell Smiley their stories, which are tied together in Smiley's plodding, accountant-like analysis, each one leading closer to an understanding of who the mole is and how he may be caught before more good people are shot, or tortured and shot and killed.    Tinker Tailor is one of those excellent, complex books for which you might want to jot down names as they are presented. When I first reached the end I knew I had read a fascinating book with very interesting people and amazing stories but I had lost the logical thread somewhere around the introduction of Colonel Polyakov, which is to say, very early on.  Eventually I read it enough times to see the whole picture, and now read it every few years for pleasure.    The book is a banquet, not pub grub:  one needs time to digest the various courses and deal with the few bitters that are served in between.  There is the powerful Prideaux course, the lighter Tarr course, the Westerby and Esterhase and Max courses and other pleasing courses; and for bitters there is brief, boring verbiage here and there (Guillam's ruminations about his girlfriend, Camilla, come to mind, for example) and Smiley's visit to Connie Sachs was not wonderful for me (but necessary for the tale).    In an interview, John LeCarre said that of the twenty or so books he had written, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy was one of his best, along with The Spy Who Came in From The Cold.  Having read all of his books, I would agree, and encourage you heartily to enjoy Tinker Tailor for yourself.  -Rob E.
B003Q6D25K|1.0|As a die-hard Sci Fi fan I was anxious to see this movie.  I suffered through it in the theater, waiting for my date to admit it was a waste of money so we could leave early.  It was not to be, I suffered through the whole boring film.  It has no redeeming value.  Acting is bland, story is weak, special effects are minimal, nice dog and a good size kitchen for those into real estate.  Don't waste your money.
0735619670|5.0|This book is among the most recommended books in every book list I crossed. So, one year ago I bought it, and it was one of the most useful books I've ever read.    The book covers a lot of subjects related to software engineering, more specifically the coding process. It does not deeply cover \\"high level\\" software engineering issues - like integration, architecture or requirements - it just gives a brief overview of those subjects. However, it mentions a lot of other books on each subject at the end of the chapters.    If you are a programmer, you must read this book! Even if you know most of what this books covers (like I knew), it is still very profitable, because it formalise most of your programming knowledge. Most of the details and rules of thumb that you acquired along you journey, are written in the Code Complete. This is important to organise the things you know, that can be easily remembered.    The only thing that really annoyed me in this book, was the quote of old researches. Because I don't think most of them are still valid for today's software industry.

B0007MWZEK|1.0|This swivel sweeper was advertised \\"As Seen on TV\\". It is a very shoddy imitation. It is very noisy compared to the real one. It doesn't empty like the real one. AND it is not as sturdy as the one I had purchased two years ago. I used it once and threw it away. I should have saved the packaging and returned it, but I had already disposed of the packaging by the time I had charged the battery. It also took the seller about 12 days to get it in the mail according to the post mark. I live in HI so it was a long time coming. I would recommend everyone to stay away from this seller and his product.

B003YK42LQ|5.0|I don't understand some of the mediocre reviews for this album.  I feel Kings of Leon have made a masterpiece better then anything they have done before.  The album has diversity and depth and flows from one song to another with ease.  There are many amazing moments in this album.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I'm in love with this movie.  With a six foot bunny predicting the end of the world, a bad girl teacher (Drew Barrymore), teen angst that isn't annoying, a 100 year old deep thinking neighbor woman...and a time traveling jet engine that crashes into our protagonist's bedroom, you won't mistake this movie for some other one you've seen before.  It's wonderfully dark and manages to be a coming of age story with intense psychodrama, but with bits of satire and irony that made it that much richer.  Insightful and creepy turns out to be a surprisingly compatible combination.  I'm a sucker for skillful cinematography (that supports but doesn't upstage the story) and a powerful (but not overpowering) music score.  This film made great use of both, which made the overall effect extra gripping.  I saw the original movie, but the director's cut gave me lots of new perspectives that make the movie that much more meaningful to me.  It's too bad that this film didn't do well at the box office: a lot of people missed out on a gem.  (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B001JV5BIA|1.0|Although I love Wes Craven, I could only get thru 15 minutes of this.  Even though it's from the early 70's, I really thought I would love this since I enjoy 70's movies.   This is so boring all I could do was laugh and the \\"horror?\\"   I gave it to my cousin who also love this kind of movie and she got thru less than I did.  I do not recommend this unless you need something to put you to sleep.

B00005QGAT|5.0|Off the Wall came out 2 years before I was born. But since the Michaelmania that came up with Thriller this album was played all thru the 80s. No need to say I burned this cassette,simply cause I loved every song at only 5 years old.  Now I'm 29 years old and going back to listen to this album I ahve to say its brilliant. its an album of contrasts.You got MJ high pitch voice in contrast with hose deep bass lines. To me this is his prime vocally. all that extensive touring ended hurting his vocals in folowing albums.Plus he was only 21 here.  So the freshness,and the sweetness in his vocals while changing to a lower smooth range sometimes its..refreshing.To me is one of the best things in this album. His incredible range and power. The songwriting and compositions are brilliant,the positive energy in the MJ written songs is great.So all that combined with quincy trumpet arrangements,african percusion and MJ beat boxes(Yeah the man was genius enough to beatbox in 1979).  -Dont Stop till you get enough is a dancefloor banger that quincy took to a whole new level.   -Rock with you showcases Rod tmeperton wonderful songwriting and MJ vocals at his best.   -The album track Off the Wall has a wonderful disco feel to it,postitive energy and again 5 star vocals.I have to mention the intro.  -She's out of my life,once again MJ showcasing his diverse vocal skills if you still had any boubt about his talent.  -I cant help it is a treasure a colaboration between 2 of the most influential musicians in last 40 years. A smooth jazzy song that takes this album to the masterpiece category.  -Girlfreind brings that innocent Michael.once again CONTRAST.He could pull out ana gresive funky disco hit and a mellow ballad like this.  -Its teh falling in love,again that disco positive feel for a wonderful composition.The intro is worth mentioning too.  -Burn this disco out,Get on the floor,workign day and night are so funky. Quincy let Michael explore new avenues in these tracks.You can feel him having fun playing with his vocals like he never been alowed before.     Theres that freshness in this album.MJ didnt had a previous album to top,he didnt want to come up with something nobody heard before. He just recorded great music and thats what you get in this album. This album doesnt brake any mold and is not recorded with a music video in mind.You all know the rest of the storie,but this is plaina nd simple music. with real bass,real drums and its definately one of the best albums of R&B in history if not the best. Released in the late 70's right before MJ himself the synthtises,pop music and MTV changed the music industry forever.A legend was born. even tho Thriller is considered the best album,due to sales,the music video phenomenon etc a lot of fans and music lovers rnak this as his best album. And tehres definately a reason for it. Althou Thriller appeals to a much wider audience including rock,the futuristic Wanna be starting something and so on the truth is when it comes to music or MJ vocals...its not an easy statement to say Thriller is better than this album IMHO

B000002AP1|5.0|No need to listen to all of the self called recording \\"experts\\" reviews and bashing. This remaster sounds great.. period. And you have to remeber that this is the final product that Iggy was pleased with. Keep in mind this is his piece of art, and he has the final say. The bass, drums, and guitar are more pronounced than the original. Exactly where they should be. It's a ROCK album. And this re-mix brings that element front and center. Whether I play it in my car or home, it sounds awesome. And I have top of the line equipment in my car and at home. So....Just get it and crank up one of the greatest rock albums ever made. And for the record, I do sound for a musical venue in the Northeast. So I do have some background as far as what sounds good..and what does not. I'm 53..been rocking for quite some time, and this album always gets my heart pumpimg!!! Enjoy!!!
1439152780|2.0|This book was recommended as enjoyable if you liked Diane Setterfield's The Thirteenth Tale.  I would have enjoyed a re-reading of the Thirteenth Tale more than reading this.  While the stories were different, there were too many points of correspondence for my taste.  Twins, fires, castles, relationship with parents, remote locations were a few of the similar plot elements.  This may be a personal bias, but I prefer originality.

014241543X|4.0|If I stay is my first book by Gayle Forman, and I must say I like her already. This book is remarkable.<br /><br />I wasn't sure how the story of a dead girl would end up being intriguing, but Forman portrayed a beautiful picture of a happy family, friendship, relationship, and life choices. I like what she did with the story: the fact that we don't ONLY get to read about Mia's life or death situation, but also, we get to know Mia, her family, and her relationship with Adam (her boyfriend) and Kim (her best friend), very well. Plus, it made the book more appealing and entertaining.<br /><br />Every character has unique personality, and I liked that. I liked Mia's relationship with her family--so simple and open--and with Adam and her grandparents and Kim. For some reason, I expected the story to be full of sorrow and tears; however, that wasn't the case. Instead, this book was full of life. Mia was relatable and realistic--with all the sadness, happiness, love, quarrel, laughter, and tears made it more realistic and engaging, if you will. Forman created this believable characters and situations, and it draws me in to their world. It feels like you're one of them. You're the member of the happy family. And that made the book more alive and loveable.<br /><br />Overall, if I stay is an amazing read that anybody would enjoy. It's a beautiful told story, and I look forward to read her next book.
B001FB4VZS|4.0|If only SMALLVILLE were as good some seasons ago... I've got a Benjamin Button thing going on with this series. The Justice Society of America episode compelled me to watch the rest of Season 9, and I liked Season 9 enough that I took a chance with Season 8, which is also watchable enough that I'll now be checking out Season 7.<br /><br />For all the myriad of sub-plots floating around in Season 8, really, there are two core story threads. One is Clark's assuming the role of Metropolis's mysterious guardian known insipidly as the \\"Red-Blue Blur.\\" The other is the coming of Doomsday who, if you know your comic book history, once upon a time killed Superman.<br /><br />The show's biggest knock, I think, will always be that it took its sweet time getting Clark in the iconic costume. Maybe Lightning Lad says it best: \\"No glasses? No tights? No flights? So far, he's nothing like the Man of Steel.\\" And Tom Welling is, what, fifty-seven years old now? Still, SMALLVILLE's getting closer to seeing eye to eye with Superman's established continuity. Clark Kent has made it to the Daily Planet as its mild-mannered and newest copy boy, a position which finds him working even more closely with Lois Lane. Clark theorizes that working at the Planet would give him a heads-up on criminal activity in Metropolis, and he's not wrong. Seems our boy scout Kryptonian is finally ready to embrace his true calling.<br /><br />This is also around the time that Clark begins to look at Lois in mushy fashion, and we also track Jimmy Olsen and Chloe's engagement and upcoming wedding. Cast regulars Michael Rosenbaum and Kristin Kreuk have amscrayed, although Kreuk returns for a few episodes. But new players step in. With Lex presumed dead, Tess Mercer becomes the new LuthorCorps CEO. The other new recurring character is Davis Bloome, a paramedic whose own arc ushers in Doomsday.<br /><br />More characters from the DC Universe are featured. In \\"Instinct,\\" the beautiful alien queen Maxima comes to Earth looking for a perfect mate, but her kiss is lethal. \\"Hex\\" introduces the reverse spell-casting Zatanna in a nifty tale in which she grants Chloe's wish to have Lois's life. SMALLVILLE's version of the Justice League shows up in \\"Odyssey\\" and \\"Doomsday,\\" including Green Arrow who takes on a semi-recurring role. The Martian Manhunter appears several times. Kara Zor-El returns in \\"Bloodline.\\"<br /><br />But let's not kid ourselves. The jewel of this season is the terrific \\"Legion\\" episode which has the Legion of Super-Heroes time hopping from the 31st century to present-day Smallville to kill Brainiac. Comic book writer, the mighty Geoff Johns, pens the screenplay and manages to cling to the show's \\"No tights\\" policy, the Legionnaires stepping to Smallville sporting cool leather jackets that bear their individual, easily identifiable insignias. I love this episode. As they say, \\"Long live the Legion.\\"<br /><br />Other favorite episodes: \\"Stilleto\\" in which Lois assumes a superhero identity. \\"Infamous\\" is a time travel/alternate reality tale in which Clark is forced to reveal his identity to the world with horrifying repercussions. \\"Hex\\" is a hell of a lot of fun, with Serinda Swan muy sexy as Zatanna.<br /><br />3.5 out of 5 stars for this season. Pretty good, but with flaws. Season 8 suffers from an inability to produce enough strong episodes and from Tom Welling's continued blandness (being so self-sacrificing is really annoying) and the unsatisfying season finale. Props, however, for the ever increasing influx of DC characters and for showcasing Brainiac in a bridal gown. With Rosenbaum gone, Allison Mack (\\"Chloe\\") takes over as the cast's strongest actor, and I'm liking how Erica Durance is interpreting Lois Lane. Justin Hartley's take on the Green Arrow keeps on irking me.<br /><br />SMALLVILLE - THE COMPLETE EIGHTH SEASON has the following special features: audio commentary on two episodes: \\"Identity\\" (with actress Cassidy Freeman, director Mairzee Almas, andexecutive producer Brian Peterson) and \\"Legion\\" (with writer Geoff Johns and producers Darren Swimmer & Tim Scanlan); Deleted/Unaired Scenes from 10 episodes: \\"Plastique,\\" \\"Instinct,\\" \\"Legion,\\" \\"Power,\\" \\"Requiem,\\" \\"Turbulence,\\" \\"Hex,\\" \\"Eternal,\\" \\"Beast,\\" and \\"Injustice\\"; \\"In the Director's Chair: Behind the Lens and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack\\" - a peek at the actress directing the episode \\"Power\\" (00:19:13 minutes long); \\"SMALLVILLE's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster\\" delves into the creative process which brought this incarnation of Doomsday to life (00:15:23 minutes).executive producer Brian Peterson) and \\"Legion\\" (with writer Geoff Johns and producers Darren Swimmer & Tim Scanlan); Deleted/Unaired Scenes from 10 episodes: \\"Plastique,\\" \\"Instinct,\\" \\"Legion,\\" \\"Power,\\" \\"Requiem,\\" \\"Turbulence,\\" \\"Hex,\\" \\"Eternal,\\" \\"Beast,\\" and \\"Injustice\\"; \\"In the Director's Chair: Behind the Lens and Calling the Shots with Allison Mack\\" - a peek at the actress directing the episode \\"Power\\" (00:19:13 minutes long); \\"SMALLVILLE's Doomsday: The Making of a Monster\\" delves into the creative process which brought this incarnation of Doomsday to life (00:15:23 minutes).

B003Q6D27S|3.0|Jigsaw's master plan finally comes to a close in SAW 3D! Detective Hoffman survives the trap set by Jill Tuck at the end of the last film, and initiates the largest game yet in order to lure an ex-partner into delivering Jill into his possession. Hoffman chooses a con-artist that has been posing a Jigsaw survivor to place in the center of his cruel new devices, but who will survive, and how will it all end? Rather than tying up the loose ends that were set up in the six previous entries, SAW 3D goes back even further in the series and re-opens closed story threads in order to further complicate the plot. If the terms convoluted, contrived, and utterly preposterous ever applied, it would be in this seventh installment. Sadly, these new twists add nothing to John Kramer's original designs. There is hope for the film yet, despite the disappointing storyline! As ridiculous and implausible as the elaborate traps may be, they even bloodier and more sadistic than ever before, with the most gore the series has ever seen. Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan's rushed attempt to write out the remaining characters and fit the final piece to Jigsaw's puzzle inevitably fails, and SAW 3D is unable to provide the epic end that fans were hoping for in the series finale.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
1594202842|5.0|A standing \\"O\\" for the courage of Amy Chua, her daughters and husband for collaborating on this funny,touching and thought provoking memoir. Of course, I had read reviews that were less than flattering...then I saw Chua interviewed. She did not fit the monster mother profiled by the critics pen. Now, having read her book, I very much respect her decision to parent the very best she way she knew. She provides a cultural perspective that is invaluable. Those who claim to \\"embrace diversity\\" are the very same who spat out negative reviews as though to do so would cleanse their palates of the bad taste her truth left in their mouths. I anxiously await a Chua family sequel.

Color and Light has bite-size nuggets of information about specific topics in painting that can be generally applied because of the depth of the explanation.

B004BA55VE|5.0|This novel is about the story of five daughters with an elderly father and an opportunistic Mrs. Bennet, their daughters will never pronounce the word mother.<br /><br />Mr. Bennet having five unmarried daughters is preoccupied because, according to the law a daughter (if not married) cannot inherit the estate where they actually lives.<br /><br />Another aspects of this novel is the centrality of the letters and their messages fundamentals for the develop of the story.<br />The most important letter is those written by Mr. Darcy to Elizabeth nor for his amorous declaration but for explain to Elizabeth why he has refused Jane and the Mr. Wickham's heredity.<br /><br />In my opinion the pride and prejudice of this novel revolves around the main characters, in particular when Elizabeth is conscious and recognise her prejudice in the confront of Mr. Darcy, the pride is to have discovered a true and unconditional love.<br /><br />The main characters are Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, the most hated is Mr.Collins.<br />Elizabeth is intelligent romantic generous determined sensible and rude girl, in brief she is the antithesis of a homophobic world.<br /><br />In my opinion Mr. Collins an handsome guy but he is a person full of hate and his aim is engage on  his suffering the people around him.<br /><br />The opposite is Mr. Darcy, his external appearance is rude and provocative, but his soul is noble romantic and altruistic and surprisingly he is against the classism of the British society, the souls of Mr.Darcy and Mr. Darcy are very similar.<br /><br />Cheers<br /><br />Italo

0740785508|5.0|This is not a book on drawing skills, such as gesture, contour, etc.  It is about the larger process of creating and the preparation for drawing itself.    The title may be bit misleading since drawing something that doesn't exist seems to me to imply drawing out of your head without models.  In other words, more of the mannerist/animator style than naturalism/the academic approach.  Instead, the author is demonstrating how to create models of people and objects that you can copy from.  I did find it interesting to see how much work goes into a professional production like the Dinotopia series.    I still don't know or really care exactly what Dinotopia is,this is the first I really heard of it, but fans of the series will love this book.  It is designed beautifully and I almost want to make myself a Dinotopia geek in order to enjoy it more.  So, while it isn't my thing, it may be yours and I won't penalize the author with any less than 5 stars it deserves.
044654759X|2.0|I have a challenge for this author. Write a great novel. Send it to publishers anonymously. No agent, no credentials at all. See what happens. I believe if not for the name recognition of this author, this novel would have been filed appropriately in the dustbin, or at least have been re-written until its many flaws were addressed.  It somehow managed to be entirely predictable, and unbelievable at the same time. It was repetitive, how many times do we need to read the exact same dialog, actions? Example: Gee, it must have been hard raising two kids on your own. Yes it was, but I love them. Multiply times 10. He drank vodka. He had a headache. Multiply 20 times.     Then, you have the unrealistically perfect love interest, Alex, who does have a huge flaw, but somehow the author misses it entirely. That is, he's an experienced detective from his army days, but does absolutely nada with this skill, failing to do anything proactive to prevent the inevitable. How much more interesting if Alex had been stalking Kevin at the same time?    Then there's the plot hole of the sleepy little town, where everyone is supposed to know everybody's business, yet (spoiler alert) a crazed gunman wanders the streets, points his pistol at kids, drives drunk and erratically,  buys a whole lot of gasoline in cans, sets fires, etc. And NO ONE calls the police or interferes in any way.    The odd twist at the end was completely out of genre and a cheap attempt at rescuing this mess. I give it a second star only for the wonderful descriptions and visual writing. Mr. Sparks, your editors and publishers have done you a disservice. You can do better. Get yourself a pen name and start writing again. Forget the eventual film you're planning. Let it go through the normal hoops an unknown author would go though. Maybe then, your true talent will shine.

B003EV6DBM|5.0|Original Rating comment was:   \\"Item was advertised as \\"New\\". Item was stretch wrapped, however inside discs were not in the numeric order as previous new purchases of Dr Who. The disc holders were taped together. I am satisfied with the quality of the disc appearance. Concern is that these should have been advertised as repackaged used. \\"    Extended comment with revised rating:  The day after comment above, Vendor called to inquire. DVD Amazon Vendor was going to remedy this immediately. There was no need to.    Today, after I researched product cover and packaging from retail big stores, BBC changed its packaging format. The new format and disk holder inserts is ineffective at best (probably Cost Savings); thus I determined not the vendor's issue.     I am changing my rating because the Customer Service from this Vendor is exceptional. The fact that the vendor called timely and was concerned,and the remedy vendor offered commendable.

B00000JTB2|5.0|'In Session' is a unique album in as much as that you get to hear two amazing blues guitarists playing a host of songs with their usual flair, but in a much more laid back and intimate way. You get some example of SRV's exuberant talent, but I'd say he plays with more feeling rather than showmanship on this CD and it is a delight to hear. It is almost the perfect counterpoint to other live albums by him. Albert King plays with his usual distinctive touch and this is almost a blues masterclass on one CD. I love hearing SRV and Albert King banter in between tracks and as they play, you get a real sense of their friendship and mutual respect. Overall this is an excellent CD and comes highly recommended for all blues fans and those SRV devotees who want something a little different.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
1400031524|2.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"The Man From Bejing\\" and \\"Faceless Killers.\\"  I was intrigued by Kurt Wallander and decided to read my way through the series.  Then came \\"The Dogs of Riga.\\"  What a disappointment.  For the vast majority of the book, Wallander wanders around, lamenting his life and inability to crack a case.  He spends most of the novel in Latvia, aimlessly moving from one building to another, waxing about dark plots, lies and conspiracies.  Did it never occur to Mankell that if his own character grows tired of his worthlessness at solving a crime, his readers might also grow weary of him?  Plus, the romantic subplot, such as it is, is terrible.  Out of nowhere, based on nothing more than two rushed meetings, Wallander falls in love with the widow of a murdered police officer?  There was nothing about that plotline that remotely rang true.  Frankly, I finished the book because I only had about 50 pages to go when I realized that the plot was never going to turn around.  I may try one more Wallander novel because every author has an off day, but this book did not live up to its predecessor, \\"Faceless Killers.\\"
B00000IFWE|4.0|'Echo' is another top album from Tom Petty. It has a more melancholy, down beat feel to it than previous albums, probably due to his recent divorce, and I found it took a few listens to get a feel for it. This isn't one to judge on first listen and is definitely a grower. Songs like the album opener 'Room at the Top' are great straight off the bat and get better and 'Swingin' is excellent, especially with Howie Epsteins descending background harmonies on the chorus. Unfortunately this album was around the time of his drug addiction and he isn't in the album photos due to missing the flights to the shoot. The title track is superb and the album closer 'One More Day One More Night' is a perfect way to end this underrated and overlooked gem. Give it a try and give it a chance to grow, you won't be disappointed as long as you don't expect the exuberance of 'Full Moon fever' or Tom's early career. A different, but equally worthy addition to his catalogue.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000OLGCI4|5.0|I have fond memories of this film from my childhood and was delighted to receive a copy for Christmas. It's just how I remember it, beautifully animated, toe tapping music, great characterisations (although this was less of a concern when I was 5!) and a good story to boot. Modern animations, although impressive, seem too polished sometimes and I love in this film how you can see the pen strokes on the screen and get a feel that there was a person behind the artwork. The songs in this film are some of Disney's most famous and rightly so, 'Bare Necessities' 'King of the Swingers', even the 'elephant parade', they really are that good . I tend to find Disney films too saccharine sweet, but The Jungle Book is just the right balance of cuteness and story. Overall a great film from the Disney back catalogue and one not to be missed.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000000OTY|5.0|'Secret World Live' is a brilliant example of Peter Gabriel in concert. You can hear how he performs the songs live and how the audience react to them. This collection includes all his major hits, as well as some songs that are less known commercially, but which are just as, if not more, impressive. This tour was highly acclaimed for it's innovative stage set, as designed by Robert Lepage, and although you can't see the set, you get a feel for how it affected the performance from the audiences reaction throughout. If you want a better idea of this, check out the DVD of this tour. This is a great album of Gabriel doing what he does best, performing simple, honest songs with passion and integrity.

If you hate it when you spend extra money to own a Blu-Ray and they only include trailers and snippets of \\"making of\\" on it (can you say, \\"Inception\\"?), you will NOT be disappointed with \\"Scott Pilgrim Vs. the World.\\" This has production extras, casting videos, video-blog entries, break-downs of the music, fight-scenes, animation, CG shots (done step-by-step--so cool), deleted scenes, bloopers, looong documentaries, and at least four separate video commentaries. I've spent most of the weekend watching and still haven't seen everything. If you love extras-- this is well worth the money!
0307346617|5.0|'World War Z', like Brooks 'Zombie Survival Guide', draws you in until your actually start to live the story. It is written in an interview format, where various people recount their experiences during the zombie war, but half way through you really start to live the story and imagine it could be real. The level of detail Brooks adds to this story is staggering and really adds to the overall reality in the book. It is extremely easy to read and looks at all aspects of life around a zombie outbreak, army response and mutiny, new society development, government plans to escape and then fight back, living on water, eradicating the zombies in water, how civilians fought back, dealing with being stranded in a zombie infested area etc etc the list goes on and is exhaustive. If you like zombie books and movies and if you enjoyed 'The Zombie Survival Guide' (which I kind of recommend you read first) then this is the very book for you. Highly recommended.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B00280LYIC|5.0|OMG!!!!!!  I LOVE this book!!!!  This is like my favorite book.  It made me want to be a demigod to.  I was such an addict to this book so badly.  I even want to learn more about greek mythology and trvel to Greece one day.  Percy in the book is so awesome plus annebeth.  I wished so much that i could be a demigod too.  i would sink into the book so much.  When the last book came out, I literally ran into the store.  Even for the new series!!!!!  Now the gods are so interesting to learn plus the heros.  Plus i am so lucky that right now in my 7th grade english class we are in greek mythology.  i love that class now.  Even my teacher, she is an awesome techer and makes our classroom like Greek!!!!!!!!!
B000001ZSE|4.0|'Images' is a pretty good place to go if you want your first hit of Jean Michel Jarres studio work. It's not necessarily the best place to go for your first taste of his music though. I tend to feel he is best heard on a live album first and 'Destination Docklands' is my personal favourite and recommendation. Never the less you get a good taste of Jarre from this CD. You get all his best known hits and you'll be surprised just how many you know. Of course 'Oxygene', 'Fourth Rendez Vous' and the excellent 'London Kid' are here, but you get a good selection of his other output as well. I guess it's worth noting here that Jarres music is very much electro pop and may be an acquired taste, but his music can be extremely powerful and stirring. The songs often build up as they progress and finish with an intensity lacking in other music of this genre. Again, that is why a live album is better as a compilation of his work, as you get the build of music and atmosphere throughout the show. Overall this is a good selection of Jarres music and a good example of his studio sound. If you like this then get out there and hunt down a live album or three!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0316067938|2.0|Breaking Dawn was only interesting in the beginning to see what happens after Bella & Edward are married. Then it is a strange and downward spiral. I found myself entirely bored 3/4 of the way through and couldn't care less what happened next. That was last year and I still haven't finished it, but I will eventually force myself for completion's sake. All the characters around Bella including Edward became so one-dimensional and agreeable saying \\"yes\\" all the time like little robots from the Stepford Wives. The previous books in the series were better. This one was just disappointing.
B000065V9Y|5.0|'Us' in the acclaimed follow up album to 'So' and while it was less commercially successful, many fans hailed it as return to Gabriel's true sound. It has many great songs, from the popular single 'Steam' to 'Digging In The Dirt' which was inspired by his marital break down. 'Blood Of Eden' is a beautiful ballad that shows Gabriel's songwriting talents fully. There are fun tracks as well like 'Kiss The Frog'. Overall 'Us' is a good album, with something there to delight new and old fans alike. Gabriel doing what he does best, writing top songs and performing them with passion. Well worth a buy.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Having read the first two, and happy with the second, I embarked on the 3rd and final story.<br /><br />It picks up immediately, just like The Girl Who Played with Fire, which I liked.  However, like the first story, it got a little held back by all the detailed pages on the conspiracy/politics and Lisbeth once again isn't in the story all the time like the second. She's such an interesting character.<br /><br />Like the first book, it took me a while to get through this book.  I trudged through the first 60% on my kindle in a couple months. I just wasn't drawn enough to my kindle to read it.  Instead of was doing New York Times Crosswords or Every Word and my kindle became a gaming unit. However, once I got past that part the story picked up I read the next 40% in a day and a half.  Like the first, it was worth it in the end to finish it, it just took me some time to get to the point where it grabbed my attention and finally held it.<br /><br />Overall I'm glad that I read all three books. Together they do tell a good story.
B000002MUN|5.0|'Wildflowers' is Tom Pettys second solo album and is the one he has gone on record as saying is probably his favourite album that he has made. Considering the amazing wealth of material that he has produced that is high praise indeed. This album is very chilled and laid back and yet it has the power to move you at a very fundamental level. From songs such as 'Crawling Back to You', 'Wreck Me', 'You Don't Know How It Feels' and one of my all time Petty favourites 'Time To Move On', you find yourself completely immersed in the story Petty is able to weave. Coupled with fun and lighter tracks such as 'Honey Bee', you have the makings of a classic album. Whenever I fancy a hit of Tom Petty and am unsure just what album to put on, I always reach for this. It seems to have the ability to be just right at any given moment that you play it. If you haven't this album in your collection then all I can say is buy it immediately. You won't be disappointed and more than likely your life will be richer for having done so. What more can I say?<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I wasn't immediately interested in this trilogy.  I looked at them several times on the Kindle Top List.  But, the idea of kids killing kids is not really enjoyment for me, and I wasn't a huge fan of the movie \\"The Running Man\\" (based on the Stephen King Book) and I was afraid that this book was going to be like it or remind me of it and feel like a knock off.    Then I had several friends tell me how amazing the books were.  So I sampled it on my Kindle and was intrigued.    I bought the book and read it in a a day and a half.  I read every free moment I had.    My friends were right.  It was a great book.  It was an intriguing story and it was fast paced.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end and immediately sampled the next book just to get me by until I have time to read again, when I will buy that one too.    I think what I liked most about the book was that Suzanne Collins writes in a way so that you are not reading a story so much as immersed INTO it by how she tells the story.  It reminds of the Twilight Series in how they are written in first person and detailed in a way that you feel you are the character and experience as they are.  You simply get lost and feel like you are on Katniss' side as a silent partner as she goes through this crazy experience. The characters are all interesting as well and how they interact is equally entertaining.    WARNING....if you want to get through The Hunger Games with no spoilers, don't read the description for the next book, \\"Catching Fire\\" until you are done.  While I had a feeling how the story was going to end before it was revealed, I read the description for Catching Fire and found via the description I was going to be right.   It didn't ruin the story for me but had I known that I wouldn't have looked at it.
B0000C9ZSV|5.0|This CD is an amazing live performance by Jimi Hendrix. Although I love the Woodstock concert, I feel this is a better example of Jimi Live. His playing is more coherent, the sound is better, the band is tighter and the choice of songs are perfect. As usual with Experience Hendrix releases there is an excellent booklet with plenty of information and pictures and the overall packaging is great. 'Stone Free' stands out for me on this CD, but to be honest the whole collection is just superb. If you want to a great example of Jimi's live work then you can't go far wrong with this, well worth a listen.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.

B000008J3I|5.0|Elements is probably one of the best places (along with Tubular Bells, of course) to start with Mike Oldfield. This has a great selection of his music over the years up to his Tubular Bells 2 album. You get a fair range of his instrumental stuff, as well as his other songs such as the excellent 'Family Man' which has one of the best Oldfield solos ever, in my opinion. He has always been an original, enigmatic character and this collection goes some way to introducing you to the music of this unique songwriter and musician.

1439107955|5.0|The heralded \\"war on cancer\\", fought through the '60s and '70s with unprecedented levels of government funding and much fanfare, failed to reduce the number of deaths from cancer. In fact, cancer deaths actually increased during this period. The war on cancer was spearheaded by Mary Lasker, a socialite activist with strong marketing credentials and Sidney Farber, an accomplished scientist and physician who had developed some of the first effective chemotherapy regimens.    Chemotherpy drugs are essentially poisons which preferentially attack cells which are prone to divide. Some of these drugs had proven effective in causing remission of certain types of leukemia and lymphoma. The emphasis of the \\"war\\" was the development and testing of cocktails of chemo drugs.    Unfortunately, these drugs didn't work so well on many other types of cancer, but it took a long time to establish this through meaningful trials. Since the underlying mechanisms of cancer was not really understood, the trials were essentially shots in the dark.    Moreover, at the same time, the rate of smoking continued to increase in the US due to compelling advertising campaigns by the cigarette companies and the effectiveness of their lobbying at forestalling any preventative actions by congress.    So the increase in rates of lung cancer overwhelmed any decrease in cancer rates achieved in other cancers by chemo.  The unfortunate focus on treatment, rather than prevention, given the state of knowledge at that time, is a cautionary tale.    This book is excellent. It is very readable and insightful, and gives the reader an clear understanding of what is known about cancer. The subject matter is, of course, grim. The personal stories of cancer patients are wrenching and often very sad; this book is not for everyone.     The author, who has been both a research and clinical oncologist,  makes it clear what different worlds these two disciplines are.  He describes conferences where there is no interaction of any kind between the two groups.    The story is told semi-historically, looking at the history of each of the different major approaches to attacking the disease: surgery, chemotherapy, targeted drugs.    The final portion of the book, which focuses on targeted therapies based on our understanding of oncogenes (genes which cause or prevent cancer) and their pathways, is hopeful, but not rosy. We have come a long way in our understanding. Their are some common characteristics that all cancer cells have: they divide rapidly, they travel, they stimulate the growth of blood vessels to feed themselves, they resist cell suicide (apoptosis) and live a long time and keep dividing.    In order for a cell to take on these all characteristics, mutations (typically several) in certain genes (oncogenes) must occur. There may be many causes for this, including carcinogins like tar, soot, DDT and many other chemicals, radiation or viruses. However, many potential onco-genes have been identified by comparing the genomes of normal and cancer cells. In most cases, it remains to be determines which of these are crucial is the causal chain. Even in cases where a causitive oncogene is known, it is very challenging to produce a drug which   which is deliverable, targeted and potent. In addition, many cancers mutate as they divide, often thwarting the drugs' means of attack. Moreover, drugs are often particular to a cancer with a particular genetic signature. Since drug development is expensive and uncertain, big pharmaceutical companies are often hesitant to invest in a targeted drug program unless it is clear that the affected population is large enough to make the drug a blockbuster.    Nevertheless, effective genetic therapies exist: Herceptin for certain types of breast cancer, and Gleevec, for certain types of leukemia. They do not have the broad toxicity of chemotherapy. And there are at least 20 more such drugs undergoing clinical trials.    The authors view is that we willnot \\"cure\\" cancer in the foreseeable future. It is too multi-faceted a disease to find a single silver bullet. However, he strongly believes that between better prevention and drugs targeting particular oncogenes, we will substantially increase and improve the life of cancer patients.
B000002O5L|5.0|I grew up on this album and it is the place where I heard Tom Petty first. This album is light and fun and will have you hooked from the word go. Jeff Lynne's production and co-writing abilities compliment Tom's style perfectly and the album they crafted has become a classic. This has such wonderful tracks as 'Free fallin', I won't back Down', 'Runnin' Down A Dream' and many more. In fact I'd go so far as to say that there isn't a dud track on this album. The slowest track on the CD is 'Face in The crowd' and for sheer melancholy and feeling it can't be beaten. This album may be short but every second is perfectly crafted and you'll never want it to end. You can't go far wrong when buying this CD, you may be bitten by the Petty bug, but boy is that first bite delicious!<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0375842209|5.0|When I first started the book, I was not sure it was going to go anywhere....but, I stayed with it, and soon found the \\"voice\\" of the very unusual narrator to be unbelievably heart-wrenching. The time period and events deal with those surrounding Nazi Germany and the Holocaust; however, it contains incredible dimension, and goes so much deeper through the character formation... the writing is breath-taking and, as I mention in the title of my review, mesmerizing. I read a great many books and find few that match the richness found here. I actually went back and re-read the first few chapters after I finished the book. And, it stayed with me a long time. A last note: for anyone who is hesitant about reading another story about the Holocaust, don't-- this one is different-- very different. This book is worth your time, money, and heart.
B000I5X81A|5.0|'The Road To Escondido' is the brilliant collaboration between JJ Cale and Eric Clapton, and like his previous album with BB King, this is a match made in heaven. The playing is smooth, relaxed and yet full of the flair that makes them both so highly respected. I found particular tracks, such as 'Hard To Thrill' and 'Don't Cry Sister' stood out first listen, and 'Who Am I Telling You?' has a wonderfully laid back feel to it, that soothes me ever time I hear it. 'Ride The River' is a superb album closer and leaves you smiling at the end of a Cd's worth of top music. This album gets better with repeated listening and after EC's slightly lack lustre 'Back Home' album, this is a welcome tour de force. The playing is sharp, the songwriting is spot on and the blend between JJ and EC is pretty unbeatable. A great album and well worth a listen.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0375842209|5.0|Welcome aboard the Hitlerian Titanic Apocalypse. Your guide will be Death himself collecting the souls of the fallen, no matter how. And keep on mind this Death has fallen in love with Liesel, the main character in the story. Let's follow that girl from 1938-39 to 1943-44 in Germany next to Munich.<br /><br />That book, I dare not call it a novel because it seems to be a lot more than just a work of fiction, is going to wring pangs, tears and all kinds of suffering moans from you. It is going to show that from 1939 to 1943 Germany was the heart of history. Human history changed course in these four years, never to come back to what it used to be.<br /><br />This short period of history is going to be described from inside Germany and from the point of view of some of the poorest Germans. You will see the effects of the propaganda and the war on them, on their souls before these souls be delivered to Death for some kind of exit from real life. Restrictions will be something real and the result of these on food and especially the scarcity of food.<br /><br />Liesel and her brother, who will not see the end of the trip, are sent to some foster family because her mother (the father is already long gone) is taken away to an unnamed destination with no future return. It is murmured the parents were communists. The foster family is poor and have two older children who are ferocious supporters of Hitler, whereas the parents are just following the trend, more or less, with a few \\"less\\" moments, such as painting the doors of Jews when they are soiled before the Jews are forcibly removed. We really feel how this society, when finally purified of all that is declared not properly German, is unified in the cult of a man, of a policy, of a future.<br /><br />The children are forced to be members of the Hitlerian youth movements and they are brought up in the spirit of offering their best deeds and achievements to Germany and Hitler. It's not because they like Hitler, really, but because they love Germany and Germany had been run down into the mud for quite a while. Hitler provides the Germans with pride in their being Germans. This basically human desire to be proud of oneself and one's country or society is described in small details and moving situations.<br /><br />Yet the book centers on a visitor. Hans Hubermann had fought in the First World War and had survived because a Jew had decided to tell the officer who wanted a volunteer who could write that Hans Hubermann was the man he was looking for and he needed. Hans did not go to the battlefield on that day. No one came back from it. This relation is conveyed in the book via the accordion of this Jewish soldier that Hans had recuperated and learned how to play and is playing regularly for money, for entertainment and for nostalgic pleasure.<br /><br />The son of this Jewish soldier arrives some day in 1938-39 as the sole survivor of his whole family who accepted to spare him on the day of their arrest. Hans Hubermann and his wife Rosa do not even question the wisdom of harboring a Jew in 1939 in Germany. They just do it as a personal debt, as a personal duty: to pay back the sacrifice of the dead father. Liesel and that Max Vandenburg become accomplices and the keepers of their own secret. Hans had taught Liesel how to read and write in the basement. Liesel is going to read and write stories for Max, of Max and about Max in that basement.<br /><br />To compensate this ferocious period, Liesel and her best friend and neighbor Rudy Steiner, a young boy and then teenager who wants to be a new Jesse Owens and nearly is in 1942 in honor of Hitler himself, become thieves: apples, potatoes in a gang, but books in Liesel's case from the personal library of the Mayor's wife. She steals books to read them, then to read them to Max, then to read them to everyone in the bombing shelter in 1942-1943, and encouraged by this Mayor's wife along with the two \\"books\\" Max had written to her on recuperatedand painted over Mein Kampf pages, she finally writes her own story on a diary given to her by the Mayor's wife, during the night in the basement, which will save her from the bombing that will kill everyone else.<br /><br />And yet this summary is hardly ten percent of the book. Three poignant scenes, among many ohers, punctuate the story. Regular parades of Jewish prisoners were marched across Munich and Molching to go to Dachau, the Concentration Camp. Such parades were fulfilling many objectives: to satisfy the need for barbarity in the SS and other German military; to humiliate these Jews into parading animals in a victory march for Nazism; to educate the people who are watching and no one would miss one parade for any price under the sun.<br /><br />Once, Hans Hubermann gives a piece of bread to one of the Jewish parading prisoners. You can imagine the consequence. Another time Rudy and Liesel deposit stale pieces of bread on the road where a Jewish parade was going to pass. You can imagine the result. Finally one day Liesel watches the last Jewish parade to check as usual is Max is among them since he left after the first incident. And that day he is. You can imagine the scene. At these moments the book is so strong that we could even put it down: it is more than soul-raking, it is soul- breaking and who wants to have his soul shattered? If you're not afraid of that, this book is the book you have to read. Good night and good luck.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUs her own story on a diary given to her by the Mayor's wife, during the night in the basement, which will save her from the bombing that will kill everyone else.

0446579939|5.0|I have become a fan of Nicholas Sparks. I love this story, the research involved, and most of all, I love his writing style. The smoothness of the sentences is amazing.<br /><br />This is such a sweet love story. I love how Thibault, the main character, protects Elizabeth. He never comes on too strong and is always attune to her feelings.He befriends the grandmother, Nana, and the son, Ben because they are good people and he comes to like them.<br /><br />I do plan on reading more books by this author. I find his characters genuine, well rounded, and refreshing.
0439023491|5.0|These books to me are characterized by at least one moment in each book where I feel so upset/agitated/bothered that I feel like I cannot go on reading.  In a good way of course because those feelings show how involved with these characters I have become.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD!<br /><br />The moment that happened in this book was the announcing of the victors for the Quarter Quell (Peeta and Katniss included).  I honestly put the book down and thought, \\"I CANNOT go through this again.\\" That is how upsetting The Arena is/was for me.  But I pushed through and am so glad I did because to meet the other victors, most notably, Finnick, was a wonderful surprise.  Also, it helped this time around that everyone around Katniss was falling victim to the Capital horrors including wise-fashionista mentor, Cinna.  It made the arena seem less of another Poor Katniss! moment than it could have been because everyone at this point is suffering.  The Arena introduced a totally fresh, interesting turn of horrors which glued me to my seat throughout.<br /><br />I thought the victors were rescued at the perfect time because we obviously needed a different (less brutal) end to this Hunger Game.  I also wanted more Finnick (and Annie).<br /><br />As for the Peeta/Gale triangle, Peeta continues to unflinchingly adore our Katniss (which I love) and we see so little of Gale but for some reason I am Team Gale.  I can almost feel Gale's eyes on her in the arena even though he is so removed from her always.  The only complaint I have is that Prim and Katniss's mother remain mysteriously absent of personality in this book (as well as Book 1) and Katniss's martyrdom for them (other than the blood-relation aspect) remains unclear.<br /><br />This is definitely a strong follow-up to the great first book and I have such a clear picture in my head of the Quarter Quell Beach/Jungle Arena.  I'm excited to see it pop up on a movie screen in a preview sometime in 2012/2013. Anyway, if you loved the first book, you will love this one too!irst book, you will love this one too!

I found a Discovery of Witches to be a refreshing and fun read.  After reading the first few pages, I was completely hooked!  Even though I found that some parts of the story were slow and I would have liked a little more action, the writing was excellent and I was still fully engrossed in the characters that in the end, I really didn't mind the slow parts.    I was super bummed when I realized that this book is the first in a series.  I usually like to start a series when all the books are out so that I don't have to wait to continue the journey.  Can't wait for the next installment!!
1416594795|5.0|Dawkins does an excellent job of giving a broad, yet in-depth, survey of the massive amount of evidence for evolution. He does a remarkably good job of making each line of evidence intelligible and intriguing, leaving one in eager anticipation of the next wonderful example. Although his book focuses on biological evolution, he does take a few detours to explain concepts like radiometric dating and plate tectonics, which are necessary for understanding things like the fossil record and bio-diversity. By doing so he anticipates uninformed counter-'arguments' that attempt to challenge these pillars of evolutionary evidence. By the end of his book, the reader can no longer claim ignorance on the topic. He or she must either acknowledge the mountain of evidence that demonstrates the fact of evolution, or else dispense with reason and reject it out of illogical faith.     Although Dawkins maintains a slightly polemical tone throughout his book, he makes it clear from the outset why this is: roughly 40% of Americans reject the theory of evolution, despite the fact that it has been accepted by the scientific community for over a century. Many of these \\"history-deniers\\" (as he calls them) are actively seeking to ban evolutionary theory from public schools, a tragic situation given that evolution is the great and only unifying theory of biology.     Another great book on the evidence for evolution is Jerry Coyne's [[ASIN:0143116649 Why Evolution Is True]]. His work overlaps with Dawkins' book in some areas, but he takes a somewhat different approach and includes plenty of fascinating information not found in this book.

What Ozzy wants you to know, well, you get the full serving of it from the man who lived it. THAT is what I look for in a bio, not some smooth, scripted version from a hired dress up artists. The title says it all and those interested in the Alpha (as in the first heavy metal singer ever) need look no further. The other books on him have their moments, but this one is entirely Ozzy! And anyone who has ever heard his singing knows he's the best that's ever been...

Iron Maiden will now appeal more to fans of progressive metal bands such as Dream Theater, Queensryche, Fates Warning and Rush rather than the old school NWOBHM fans.  I think this change in style works well with their maturity; after all, Bruce, Steve and the boys are smart guys- they can't keep churning out 80's metal forever.  If you want the nostalgia of 'Number of the Beast', go and put that cd on, its a great 80's metal album. I still play it myself. But this is 30 years later, and Maiden have gotten more sophisticated.  This is some seriously dense, complex, intellectual metal, and takes a few listens to really begin to sink in- much like classic prog albums such as 'Tales from Topographic Oceans' and 'Images and Words'.
B002KKCXTE|3.0|In case no one has noticed this is an import from either the UK or EU.  That is the reason for the \\"ridiculous\\" pricing.  Also the only person that has actually purchased the box set gave it a 5 star rating.  Frankly Amazon needs to sort out their reviews.  Personal recommendation:<br /><br />1. Separate reviews for each release.  When I am buying a Blu-ray I and I am sure many others hate wading through a bunch of VHS, DVD, and previous releases to get to an honest review of the product.<br />2. Either eliminate the ability of persons who have not purchased the product from leaving a review or completely separate their opinion from persons who own the product.<br />3. Imports should be well marked.  Even Region Free Discs if they are DVDs will not play unless you own a PAL to NTSC converter.  And Blu-ray releases need to be marked Region A or Region ALL as a standard for sales on the US website.  If you do not have region A or All they will not play obviously.  And finally when purchasing a ALL region Blu-ray discs keep in mind that if the extras are Standard Def they most likely will be unviewable as they will not be in NTSC format.  I have personal experience with this when I purchased Ghost in the Shell 2.0/Ghost in the Shell: Innocence from the UK site and when I went to see if the extras that were clearly marked as SD did not play because they are PAL format.  I did not buy them for the extras but for the main features so it was a no biggy for me, I just wanted to inform anyone reading this of the differences in purchasing import items.<br /><br />If you do not own the item and have not personally viewed the product keep your trap shut.
B0018BB21G|4.0|Another big hit from The Moody Blues.....and this time, I don't admire it as much as Days of Future Passed. The songs don't seem completely memorable to me, and the lyrics aren't as creative. Maybe it's because I didn't have the right mood while listening from beginning to end. But still, this is a very good one from the band, and it's high praise is well-deserved. The music sounds enchanting most of the time, the lyrics are pretty solid (even when compared to lyrics from DOFP), and the sound quality from this 2008 reissue is really nice (the bonus tracks are essential for those who consider The Moody Blues to be their favorite). In Search of a Lost Chord isn't at all that bad; it's just that it's not the most endearing album created from the band. Here's hoping that the next album (On the Threshold of a Dream) is a bit better.<br /><br />Grade: 7.6/10
B0041KKYEM|5.0|A-<br /><br />A bizarre combination of art-house drama and psycho-sexual thriller, Darren Aronofsky's \\"Black Swan\\" is really an allegorical account of a young woman's descent into madness. It's also a variant of sorts on \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,\\" exploring the evil twin that lurks deep inside each and every one of us.<br /><br />Nina (Natalie Portman) is a sheltered, intensely disciplined and sexually repressed ballerina who's just landed the role of a lifetime - that of the Swan Queen in a major New York ballet company production of \\"Swan Lake.\\" Yet, while her innocence and formal perfectionism make her a natural for the part of the White Swan, she may lack the fiery, hot-blooded temperament and life experiences needed to convincingly portray the Black Swan. Or so the company director (Vincent Cassell) tells her, a man with an obvious interest in Nina beyond the purely professional. But Nina clearly has more pressing issues to deal with than just a lecherous dance instructor and a mother (Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer herself, who clearly wants to control every aspect of her daughter's life. Nina seems to be losing her grip on reality, as she begins to hear muffled voices, starts bleeding mysteriously from various parts of her body, and appears to be two different people when peering into a mirror. In fact, the idea of dopplegangers becomes a major visual motif throughout the film - reflective of the White Swan/Black Swan, Jekyll and Hyde, Good vs. Evil dichotomy - with one minor character even at one point assuming that Nina and a fellow ballerina are sisters because they look so much alike - as most ballerinas, almost by definition, have a tendency to do. Subtly at first, then with greater intensity as the story progresses, Nina begins to reflect a person deep in the throes of a nervous breakdown.<br /><br />With a screenplay by Mark Heyman, John McLaughlin and Andres Heinz, based on a story by Heinz, \\"Black Swan\\" borrows quite liberally from earlier movies. There's a touch of \\"All About Eve\\" in its tale of an up-and-coming newcomer (Mila Kunis) seemingly intent on usurping Nina's lead in the production; there's a hint of \\"Carrie\\" in the dysfunctional mother/daughter relationship; and the whole young-woman-slipping-into-madness scenario is eerily reminiscent of Roman Polanski's film \\"Repulsion\\" from 1965. That being said, Aronofsky brings a great deal of his own to this work, keeping the horror movie hokum down to a minimum (though some does creep in from time to time) and effectively plunging us into a dizzying alternate reality in the bravura, brilliantly shot and edited scenes towards the end of the film. In fact, the closing stretches of the movie represent cinema in its purest form, as the pacing builds to a frenetic crescendo, perfectly reflective of Nina's mental state at the moment. Nina ultimately finds it in herself to truly become the Black Swan, but at what cost to herself and those around her?<br /><br />The movie is obviously intended as a cautionary tale about the dangers of obsession and of avoiding life, and about the way in which single-mindedness when carried to the extreme can lead to psychological damage and even insanity for the individual involved. And who is more single-minded, disciplined and obsessed than a prima ballerina?<br /><br />To say that Portman delivers a tour-de-force performance in this role would be to minimize her accomplishment; she throws herself so deeply into the character that it's hard to decide which is more impressive: the sheer overwhelming physicality of it all or the wrenching emotional conviction. This is clearly her movie, and she has given her whole heart and soul to it. Kunis is equally impressive in the Eve Harrington role of the far more easygoing, but clearly manipulative soubrette whom Nina is convinced wants to take her place in the show. And Hershey brings a compelling mixture of jealousy and concern to the role of a mother who's been where her daughter is now but whose influence over her seems to be waning over time.<br /><br />Like Nina, we like to show only the White Swan aspect of our personalities to the world at large, choosing to hide - whether consciously or unconsciously - the Black Swan side from public view. Yet, as Nina soon discovers, the Black Swan will at some point insist on having its day, perhaps going so far as to kill off the White Swan in an effort to assert its preeminence.<br /><br />Freud would have had a field day with this movie.to be waning over time.

030746363X|4.0|Lots of crazy ideas that may work. I have been going to the gym for 7 months. I started doing 15 minutes on the treadmill 5 days a week. I can now do 60 min on the treadmill or elliptical for 3 days. I do weights 2 days. After 7 months I have lost NO weight. I'm still 330 pounds! I eat healthy 95% of the time. I was getting more than a little frustrated, then I downloaded your book. On Monday I'm going to try the kettlebell. I saw one among the dumbbells at the Y but I didn't know what it was. I've been watching videos on UTube all weekend to learn the correct form. I'll also ask the trainer at the gym to show me how it's done.    I'm going to give it a go.    Thanks for an easy to understand book and making me feel that things can change.
B003YUC2FE|3.0|The positive- It was great to get all 3 blu-rays, dvds, and digital copies at one time.     The negatives- As many reviewers have already said, the packaging is terrible, I had to buy jewel cases to store the movies in. That, in itself, is not that big of a deal, the real problem is with the blu-ray discs. The first time out of the box all 3 blu-ray discs skip at a particular point in the movie. There are no scratches on any of the discs, it appears to bad write-to-disc on the part of the production company.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This show is just funny.  It's about nerds trying to cope with real life, girls, and society.     We all have had one of these guys in our past or present.  We all wonder how someone so smart can have so little sense.    This show portrays that concept and makes it funny.  The casting is perfect and the cast dynamics just work.  Kaley Cuoco is perfect as the female lead.  She has matured nicely from Brigette on 8 Simple Rules.    Every episode makes you laugh and finds you rooting for the geek to win.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Gandhi was an incredible movie about a man who believed in world peace through nonviolence.  He began his work in South Africa and later in India where he helped both countries gain independence from British rule.  He had charisma that people followed to his death and I was impressed how he helped people by becoming one of them.  Gandhi dressed like them, would walk for hundreds of miles, take third class trips, and was front of the line when it came down to all the acts.  He had small villages created where people had to perform all work duties down to the lowest duties of society.  The belief was that all the citizens were one and apart of each other and that no one could make a stand without fully understanding one another.  He was arrested countless times for simply creating a movement among people and embarrassing the government officials.  His nonviolent acts included marches, burning English cloth, taking multiple blows without giving one back, and making salt that is an essential substance to Indian ways of life.  The end of the movie was a battle between Hindus and Muslims and even they were willing to set aside violence for temporary peace.      All religions are powerful and beautiful in their own way.  In the movie, Gandhi states that truth and love always win in the end and that tyrants and murderers are popular for a while, but fall in the end.  This concept was proven several times because Gandhi always taught that if we love each other like a brother, then there will be world peace.  Gandhi also talked about how all religions come down to the same God and the different books such as the bible or Koran don't make much of a difference.  The movie was heartbreaking to watch because it is hard to imagine a world or a particular place with so much violence.  In this movie, all citizens including women and children suffered and were killed due to British brutality and civil war.  Infrastructure such as trains, buildings, and automobiles were destroyed as well.  I've had the pleasure of studying Hinduism in my religion class and I've learned that it is a subtle religion that looks for the good in people and maybe we can have world peace in the future.

0670022411|5.0|A definite keeper on the shelf!   I opened this book expecting the usual vampire and witch love  story but this book is in a class of its own. There are so many authors writing about vampires and witches now that it's very hard to distinguish yourself apart from other authors  in a genre that is now over flowing but Deborah Harkness has done just that. By adding the history element to the storyline Harkness adds a bit of substance and interest to the  storyline.  This book has been dubbed the adults version of Twilight and although i liked that series, i feel that this just doesn't give it justice.... This vampire certainly doesn't sparkle!   This book is a start of a series and I cannot wait until the journey continues, this novel was definately setting the foundations for a promising new series. I finished the book and immediately wanted more, i hope its not a long wait!!  A MUST BUY!!

B004EI3ON4|5.0|I watched this movie, and I heard that the story had issues, but I went for the visuals, which I was super excited about. The movie was surreal and awesome to watch, and the music was so perfect for the visuals. I dug the music so much through the whole movie that even as I watched it I was planning to go home and buy the soundtrack off Amazon.   Imagine my surprise and delight when I looked it up only to learn that DAFT PUNK was responsible for the whole soundtrack! No wonder it was so good! It's so nice to have certain artists that will keep bringing it, again and again, even when you didn't even realize it. GO DAFT!    This album is like an electronic/orchestral score. Several nonconsecutive tracks musically reference and reflect each other, like movements in one much larger piece. Everything is very electro and feels seriously 80s yet very futuristic. When I listen to it, I imagine myself on a glowing motorcycle, racing through the grid. A surreal experience and an interesting offering from Daft. Enjoy!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|There's basically two routes I take with headphones:<br /><br />1)Buy extremely cheap headphones, with a limited shelf-life, and hope for the best.<br /><br />2)Fork over the extra cash and go for premium.<br /><br />I've found that its not even worth it to buy head phones in the $20-$80 range; they all break easily, unexpectedly, and all prove too fragile. These Sony MDRs, however, are a steal at $84, and they're durable as hell! It's so worth it to make the investment at the current price, because any less money spent on a single pair will eventually lead to numerous replacements, and probably quickly.

B001UE27X8|5.0|The quotation is coincidentally Keats (\\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\"); literally, or factually, they're the last words Bill Evans ever spoke to Tony Bennett (as reported by Evans' biographer and repeated in the program notes by writer Will Friedwald).  Having recently worked like a mono-obsessive madman to accompany a vocalist (with Pavarotti chops) accustomed to big band vocal tracks, I decided to order the latest complete version of the two sessions laid down by Bennett and Evans--what did these two giants do to pull off a deceptively hazardous--seemingly impossible--endeavor, with such undeniably stunning success?  When one of the alternate tracks is listed as \\"Take 18,\\" that in itself speaks volumes. These two extraordinarily gifted musicians worked hard and long (obsessively so, it would appear) to achieve a result that practically belies the fact that the expressive source is two musicians, not one: their musical relationship is as tight, unified, of an organic whole as humanly possible.  Bill eschews walking bass lines while strictly limiting even his use of explicit two-beat sections to make up for the absence of bass and drums.  The latter are present, but in a \\"virtual\\" sense that can exist only in the empathetic imaginations, or psychic relationship, of two distinctive voices who, for these extraordinary moments, are of one mind.<br /><br />The time is there, but it bends to fit words, mood and the moment, taking on a life of its own, serving as an invisible muse whose presence animates the proceedings.  Perhaps it's safe to say that this is the most \\"mystic\\" of albums by a jazz vocalist.  Sinatra's mastery of the big-scale album is counterbalanced by Tony Bennett's claim that nothing was more satisfying to him than his duet recordings with Bill Evans and small group recordings with Ralph Sharon.  After listening to the evidence, and after reading the especially inspired, detailed and instructive \\"program\\" notes by Will Friedwald, I feel all the wiser, despite my possession (in LP and CD formats) of the previous editions.  If you don't have this session, by all means this is the one to own.  If you have the session in an earlier format, give this one serious consideration nonetheless.  It has not only doubled my appreciation of the two performers but offered fresh insights into the mysterious process of communication that can occur only when two brilliant musicians agree on a single priority above all others: the music.<br /><br />Tony's two sessions with Bill Evans arguably represent the apex of his career and justifiably bring higher prices as used copies than any number of his big production albums (like the \\"Duets\\"), the relaxed sessions with his trio (led by pianist Ralph Sharon), or the many \\"Best of,\\" \\"Ultimate,\\" or \\"Essential\\" anthologies.  There are close observers of the Great American Songbook and its primary caretakers who feel that the most inspired, exemplary and significant expressions of this indigenous art form are to be found in the \\"concept albums\\" of Frank Sinatra and Nelson Riddle.  Each is thematically and musically organized, resulting in stunning, unified, organic \\"tone poems,\\" or \\"suites.\\"  To name just three striking examples, there are the swing-themed occasions, like \\"Songs for Swinging Lovers\\" (Capitol); the introspective, often gut-wrenching, unflinching and elegiac torch albums (Sinatra called them \\"wrist-slashers\\" or \\"suicide songs\\") like \\"Only the Lonely\\" (Capitol); and finally the Broadway, Rodgers and Hammerstein-inspired, semi-operatic (and dramatic) blockbusters, like \\"The Concert Sinatra\\" (Reprise).<br /><br />I would argue that Tony Bennett's meetings with Bill Evans comprise his equivalent of Sinatra's transformation of a poorly understood popular form into art of the highest order.  Now that the smoke has cleared concerning the last 50 years of jazz history, it becomes ever clearer that the music's direction and language have been shaped, above all, by two seminal geniuses: pianistBill Evans and tenor saxophonist John Coltrane (for the first 50 years, three musicians must be viewed as having a similar, possibly greater influence: Louis Armstrong (perhaps Tony's primary influence), Charlie Parker, and Duke Ellington (in whom Tony finds a \\"spirituality\\" that many younger listeners identify with Coltrane).  And none of the foregoing is meant to take anything away from the undeniable influence of Miles Davis--less as a soloist (though he was much better than many listeners realize) than as a facilitator, standing at the vanguard of every important movement from bebop to fusion and hip-hop.<br /><br />The point is that just as it's become a no-brainer to identify the greatest recording ever made by vocalist Johnny Hartman because of the presence of John Coltrane (\\"John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman\\" continues to win new admirers with each passing year), the presence of Bill Evans lessens the greater difficulty of selecting a comparable outstanding moment in Bennett's far more numerous discography.<br /><br />It used to annoy me that many listeners familiar with the first of the two giants' meetings were clueless about the second, which may be even slightly stronger in its programmatic and musical elements than the first.  Now that oversight has been corrected, and it's about time that after all of these years, conflicts between two different labels do not deprive the discerning listening public from discovering the glowing, singular, inexhaustible life and beauty of both sessions.<br /><br />If you have the two individual sessions, it may be a tough decision--the \\"Complete\\" version has numerous alternate takes that will not necessarily fit the needs or priorities of many listeners (I know quite a few musicians who have come to resent alternate takes and bonus tracks).  But just as I found it necessary to order \\"The Complete Bill Evans Vanguard Sessions\\" (from 1961, with Scott LaFaro), despite possessing the two LPs and two CDs of the same Sunday afternoon date, I'd recommend the same consideration for this latest complete package of a rare moment, or landmark (make it two), in America music.  On the other hand, if you have both Evans/Bennett sessions in their original format and have yet to experience Bill Evans' \\"The Last Waltz\\" and \\"Consecration,\\" the priority has to be given the latter two  performances. Be prepared to become absorbed--deeply and lengthily.  There's nothing-- on record or in American music--comparable to either box set.  (Think Mozart's death-bed \\"Requiem\\"--heavy, deep, urgent, equally sublime and tragic, yet affirmative of the creative, unstoppable human spirit--all centered on a dying, depleted human specimen with nothing more than ineffable melodies to sustain him. But the music had to be played--and miraculously it was--if by the narrowest of margins.  Putting Tony Bennett (or any vocalist) in the presence of such a musician may be the equivalent of singing with a scintillating Riddle or Mandel orchestration and ensemble--or better.

It's what is known as a demographic shill. What's missing is any kind of real excitement, any kind of development, drama, groove, or inspiration. Pick up a Sly Stone album, or an earth Wind and Fire album, and find out how to produce a great album. Mojo gave this album an instant classic review. For me, instant classic is  by James Brown at The Apollo, or Small Change by Tom Waits, or early Aretha Franklin, or Dark Magus by Miles Davis, or Wholly Earth by Abbey Lincoln, or the soundtrack to City of God, or the best of De Phazz, Charles Mingus' Saint and Sinner, or Harry Nilsson's The Point, Joanna Newsom's Milk Eyed Mender, Stan Getz' and Eddie Sauter's Focus, or Tom Waits Mule Variations, or Muddy Water's Folk Singer, or well, it goes on along time...Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Hermeto Pascoal, Crosby Stills Nash and Young, Ry Cooder, Ella Fitzgerald, Eric Dolphy, Tristano, Patty La Belle, Michael Jackson, Jorge Dalto, Hans Zimmer, Hilario Duran, Bernstein, and on and on.

0061726826|5.0|Lena cannot wait for the day that she is finally cured. She lives every day in fear of the amor deliria nervosa, or the disease of love, afraid that she will be consumed by it. She knows that once she finally gets the cure, she can live without the fear of pain, and that she will never have to worry about its devastating effects again. However, that all changes when she meets a boy who is not all that he seems. Lena finds herself drawn to him, and quickly does the one thing she has feared all her life; she falls in love. In a society that would persecute her for this in a heart beat, she scrambles to reconcile her head and heart, but her head is losing the battle. She learns firsthand the all consuming effects of love and its ability to control her every decision, but she must hide her new condition at all costs, or she will lose what she has come to cherish the most; the ability to love.<br /><br />I can see where the government got the idea that love was a disease, as love will irrevocably change a person. Love makes people do crazy things, as well as having the power to completely destroy someone. However, in their quest to remove the negative effects, they also lose the good. In order to truly enjoy something and appreciate it, you also must know the pain of loss. What is the point of living if you can't experience the good and the bad? Without emotions, people may as well just be mindless shells, no more than animals that can talk, which I guess is the point in the end, as it is all about oppression and control.<br /><br />Lena's journey is one heck of an eye opener as she slowly realizes everything she has been told is a lie meant to keep the people oppressed and completely obedient. It is a slow process, but this is very realistic considering what has been drilled into her head for her entire life. I enjoyed seeing her slowly opening up to Alex, and accepting the \\"deliria\\". Once she finally gives in, it is like a floodgate opened, and she realizes that the loss of this love will do exactly as they said; it would destroy her. However, she also realizes something else, something not in their books and teachings. That love would also save her.<br /><br />When I finished this book I had two thoughts in my head, \\"Wow that was phenomenal\\" and \\"That ending should be considered cruel and unusual punishment.\\" Now you might think that might ruin the book, but even though the wait for the next one will be agonizing, the ending as is, brought the book from really good to absolutely amazing.

B00163XX0O|4.0|Although this is a cult classic, despite how popular it has become, I can't believe it will ever be mainstream. I saw the film numerous times in my less-literate punk-rock influenced youth, which does follow the book closely enough--up to a certain point. However, as is usually the case with books subsequently made into films, &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; far exceeds Kubrick's interpretation (of whom I am a fan, but &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; is certainly not his best film). Enough about Kubrick--going forward, I studied Russian for 2 years, so I understand the most common words of simple Russian that Burgess converted into his slang speak. So I'm glad I read the book after having studied Russian, instead of before. Which is not to say that I would have been lost with knowing any Russian. Despite the unique ambiance created by the &#34;Nadsatsprache&#34;, the overarching theme of the author's disillusioned view of humanity takes precedence. Alex is more precocious that any 15 year old I've ever known. However, since he inhabits a vaguely futuristic dystopic society, I'll assume that the youth of that world grow up even faster than in our current time. A 15 year old with violent tendencies who listens to classical music also seems oxymoronic--especially in the context of the present day, when the notion of the &#34;classical arts&#34; is fading into oblivion more quickly than ever. Nonetheless, in the case of Burgess's fully fleshed out and credible pseudo-fascistic-fantasma-fantasy world, suspension of disbelief becomes that much easier. And Alex is a classic anti-hero, a leader with a fierce, aggressive intellect, ironically probably the same kind of person that becomes a CEO, which would involve taming the wild animal (IE Alex) with the proper indoctrination so that he grows up to become a powerful, albeit mainstream, and savage corporate beast. After all, nature rewards aggression, provided that impulse can be correctly channeled--ultimately, &#34;A Clockwork Orange&#34; ponders the possibility of finding that balance. The final chapter does hint that the previously anti-social characters of this world will be absorbed into mainstream society.<br /><br />Stephen C.

B002BY77CW|5.0|Very different from many books I have read. As a teenager, I have of course watch the Hills, so I am a huge fan of Lauren Conrad. For a reality TV star, she truly has talent in writing, which can be shocking. This book has not only LA life included, but incorporates how teenage girls are attracted to the fame and excitement of attention and how we tend to trust people way to easily sometimes.    Very happy with this book and cannot wait to purchase the sequel!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I very much enjoyed this movie, as I like just about anything French.  Quite different and inspired, colorful and with many enjoyable characters.<br />And if you like food, well then - savor this.  ahhhhh, Magnifique!
B0041KKYCY|5.0|To start my review, I want to say that I rented this movie about a week ago (twice) and I still can't get it out my head. It moved me that much. What I meant about my title is, there's no guy with a mask (Jason, Michael, Leatherface) running around with knives, axe, or chainsaws. Also, there's not that unbelievable fictitious, severely burned character running around with blades for fingers. The story line of this movie, can really happen in real life, except for some very minor bits. Brutality, rape, and revenge happens all the time in our life. The producers just put it together remarkably on screen. Now I know, this a remake of the late seventies version and it copies someone else's work, but I am pretty sure I would still favor this 2010 version over the original, though I heard it was good.    I am the typical type of guy who roots for the male character and enjoys watching the action and violence that the male actor can bring. But after Jennifer Hill's rape scene, when I am anticipating her revenge ,I was really anxious to see the havoc and carnage that she was going to come back with. I was on edge, because there was good portion of the movie after the rape that she doesn't appear. Then BAM!! There she was! Her retribution was original and unexpected. I was in awe. To me, I thought it was genius in the way writers came up with the ideas for her revenge and it was pleasant to see carried out by Jennifer/ Sarah. Again, not your typical slice and slash. Puts ideas for revenge to a whole new level.     Even though it really wasn't that scary, I really felt on edged throughout the whole movie, up to the end when she is just sitting there. The actual rape scene was disturbing and I felt really sorry for Jennifer Hill. I kept thinking, what if she was someone I knew or cared about. If this movie had been real life and there was a young lady that was raped (especially the way she was), I would say hell yeah! Wreak Havoc! Put them through Hell, then send them to it.As for  Sarah Butler, well when watching the Special Features (The Making of ISOYG), during the interview, one of the other characters mentioned that they couldn't find another actress to play the part of Jennifer Hill. I have to disagree and I say this hesitantly. I could think of several actress who could play this role quite well.  BUT!!...BUT! !!And I want to emphasize this when I say it-  I am SO glad that Sarah Butler played the main character. I have never seen her before in any movies. She was like a breath of fresh air as an actress. Her part in this movie and just her presence just knocked me on my a**.  I guess this is what I mean when I mentioned that I couldn't get this movie out of my head. She's not the typical main stream hum-drum actress you see in the tabloids or media.  I guess that's what makes her original. She was a complete surprise. Not only is she beautiful, she played her role well (Before, during, and after the rape scene). I am grateful that she didn't portray a dumb nitwit who became submissive to the antagonists. Instead, her character immensely symbolized the Phoenix in the Fire. I enjoyed her role as a smart focused athletic young lady. Well, besides the fact that in the movie she lit up a Mary J. But even then I thought that was hot.    Well, I think after submitting this  I might rent the movie again. Hell, I might as well just go purchase it. Hope my review helped. Didn't want to mention the actual plot, because I didn't want to ruin it for anybody. Enjoy!
6304712944|5.0|This is a complete work of art!  Astoundingly gorgeous production. Every frame looks like a painting. Legendary songs, staged and sung with heart and vigor.   There is too much to say about this movie. It simply must be seen and experienced. It also contains my favorite protrayal of Merlyn.      There are reviews herein that say the DVD release cuts into the misty loveliness of the tale, making it too contrasty, highlighting some detail but obscuring others.  I think that is worth considering when deciding which version to purchase. I myself bought the VHS years ago and love it.     This is the most beautiful presentation of the story ever made.    I HIGHLY RECOMMEND it, for general audiences.
B003NSBLFY|2.0|So I had it on dvd, now I have it on blue-ray. Love the movie and still do. The main reason for this purchase was the picture, which is very crisp and comparable to the rest of my blue-ray library.     This product has quite a few extras: Some fun extras. Some tedious: the alternate film wake up Ron Burgundy... pedestrian. Some senseless, purposeless, and crass for the sake of crassness alone: the commentary sounds like Will and the director filling time talking about anything but the movie. I listened to the first 5 minutes, then skipped ahead a few chapters and each sample had less to do with movie than the last. I usually get a big kick out of commentaries. This commentary was no more than a ruse so they could print \\"commentary\\" on the cover of the box. People who like commentaries: hold no false hope for some behind the scenes insight into film making motivations, the creative process, or style of direction. Not included. It wasn't even funny... maybe that is the joke...    I would have happily given up most of the extras to save some clams. My main squeeze and I split the cost, otherwise I would not have paid more than $19. Knowing what I know now about the \\"quality\\" of the extras, I would have liked to have waited for the price to drop, or found a used copy.    Value: $12 for 1080p version. $17 for fluff.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|It made me cry, it made me laugh, and I came out of the theater with a smile on my face and oddly the sky and clouds looked just like in the movie. :-D    This is a movie for All ages, young and old alike.  I enjoyed this movie more than any I've seen in a long time.  You'll watch it often.  Enjoy!
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|This book sounds reaaly good, but I can't bring myself to outspend the hardcover addition. I suspect eventually Amazon and the publishers of these books will come to some understanding, but not yet, and so I will wait............
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|Brown has his characters deliver far-fetched and tiresomely repetitive lectures on symbolism, mixed in with them being subjected to gratuitous violence. This book is one hundred pages too long, and should have ended at it's overwrought and disappointingly lame anticlimax, but, no, Brown subjects the reader to more silly pontification about symbolic nonsense.
1439102813|5.0|Having watched my mom go through all of these stages of Alzheimer's from the time she was about 67, I found myself crying as if the story told the decline of her.  Every painful moment is explicitly explained in a very readable form.  I couldn't put the book down, and cried through the last half of it.  Perhaps those of us who have gone through this journey with a parent or other loved one are even more affected, but the book is a must read for everyone to understand this horrible disease. Do I want to know if I will develop AD?  I don't want to know.  I want to have that hope that I will not have the gene, and can continue to enjoy life for the moment.
B001P9EQH8|4.0|This device's small size and light weight make it a good match for the iPod line, and practical for use during exercise.  (Be honest, how often do you want to tether your iPod to a headphone amp several times its size?) The designers have shown admirable restraint with the bass boost function; the bump is useful but never overwhelming.  I would consider it ideal if it intruded just a little less into the lower midrange.  Some people have complained about hiss with this product, but mine is dead quiet.  Any improvement in the sound quality is subtle.  I believe I detect a little more clarity and depth, especially when feeding the amp with the line out rather than the headphone output, but I haven't done a double-blind test and I know how easy it is to deceive ones self in these matters.  I don't have any headphones that present a particularly difficult load, so I can't comment on that aspect of its performance, but with the headphones I do have, it doesn't seem like the total power out available is dramatically greater than the iPod itself.
B0045NXMJE|2.0|This movie is just not good. The plot is overly simply and uninteresting.  Jean is usually such a good director it is very hard to imagine what happened here.  I don't usually write reviews but I thought it was necessary here.  Fans of Jean beware this is not him at his best or at any level really.  If you have to see it rent it but this is not a movie to see more than once, if even that.  I would simply recommend skipping the experience in it's entirety.  I tried to make myself like it and really wanted to but there is nothing there.<br /><br /> Another reviewer mentioned Fantastic Mr.Fox.  This film is nothing like that.  The plot involves trying to take down arms dealers.  That's not really comparable to fighting to survive or steal from farmers.  Ignore that comparison.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was an awesome TV Show! I love my collection :)  We watch it over & over! Hate that it was cancelled :(  But with the movie and the complete collection, we can  enjoy the laughter & action forever! Classic in Sci-Fi!

0060594896|1.0|This book would only appeal to the most sophomoric and novice reader. 500 pages filled with the same old regurgitated mantra of \\"TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR SELF!\\". The difference between the masterpieces of Dale Carnegie or Napoleon Hill, for example, is that Jack Canfield is a bogus money-loving media man who brings nothing new but a couple of trite moronic phrases in this supposed \\"secret to eternal happiness and riches\\". Insipidity abound.<br /><br />I really couldn't stand passing by his face on the shelf so I just gave it away. Steer very clear from this, unless you are really desperate and/or dumb.

B00393C47M|5.0|While the movie was okay when HB0 behind the scenes mention that there was changes made from original book for the film I knew I just had to read original version.  The original story is so much better than the movie. It's obvious the movie tried to down play the scariness for the kids.  All the characters in this original version of the book was much better. That includes the odd man upstairs, the dogs belonging to the old ladies down stairs. Coraline's other father and such characters were also better in this version.  I also like how in this book Coraline wasn't going in and out of the other mother world every night. It focus on the events in the real world then finally had her pass through the door to the other world through a door she could walk through not crawl through as she did in the movie. If you and your kids like the movie you'll appreciate this book that much more.

B003L77GRO|5.0|I too came into watching this amazing series late. I quickly watched every episode I could get my hands on, thanks to Netflix. As if this was not enough... I had to own my own complete set of seasons 1-4 so that I can watch and rewatch this series. Seems a bit strange to cheer the antics of a serial killer on, but hey... it does save tax payers money! I can't wait to see what season 5 brings our way.  I have followed two story line series this past year, and both have been rated tops. Dexter and Sons of Anarchy.
0525951652|2.0|I'm not even sure why I gave it two stars.  I did not finish the book and I hardly ever stop reading a book half-way through.  I just didn't want to waste my time reading something that I could not get into.  Not entertaining at all.  It started out strong, but went completely down hill.  I loved Pillars of the Earth and Wold Without End, so I thought this would be a good book as well.  I was wrong.
030745455X|4.0|In the first novel of his Millennium trilogy, Stieg Larsson introduced us to journalist Mikael Blomkvist who, with help from researcher/hacker Lisbeth Salander, solved a decades-old disappearance and exposed a financial giant for corruption. In the second book, \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\", the focus shifts to Salander and a series of puzzling murders.<br /><br />Blomkvist and his magazine, \\"Millennium\\", are preparing to simultaneously run a story and publish a book about the sex slave industry between Eastern Europe and Sweden. Thanks to the research of a young reporter named Dag Svensson and his girlfriend, Mia Johansson, much of the industry has been uncovered and several key players in law enforcement are about to be exposed. However, a month before the publication date, Svensson and Johansson are found murdered in their apartment. A lawyer across town, Nils Bjurman, is also discovered to have been shot. The only clue is a revolver found at the apartment building with Lisbeth Salander's fingerprints. Why would she want to kill the couple? And how is Bjurman involved?<br /><br />The discovery of the bodies sets off a nationwide search for Lisbeth, who appears to have gone to ground. Blomkvist and Lisbeth's former boss, Dragan Armansky, are both unwilling to believe that she is capable of murder without provocation, but the police are convinced. Can they help clear Lisbeth's name and catch the real killers? And what does a mysterious man named Zala have to do with it?<br /><br />In \\"The Girl who Played with Fire\\", Larsson leads readers through a twisting journey through the troubled past of Lisbeth Salander, revealing what makes this unusual heroine tick. And while the book is definitely well put-together, it lacks a certain something that made the first one so special. I missed seeing the unusual partnership between Salander and Blomkvist. I do appreciate, however, a sequel that doesn't merely re-hash the first novel with different details. While good, it's not quite as great as \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".
B001IAOEXU|5.0|These are AWESOME! Couldnt get used to the different set up between xbox and ps3 when playing modern warfare, ps3 triggers were horrible. these things have made the game so much more fun! Well worth the few dollars they cost. I read other reviews saying that they popped off easily, but that hasn't happened to me yet. Been using them for a couple months now (every day, several times a day) and i think they are fantastic. Highly recommended.

0385341679|5.0|Honestly, I thought Karen did an excellent job with this book.  She gave us more insight into Barrons and his \\"men\\" (fallen angels maybe?  Think about it!), Dani, V'Lane (shudder!!)and of course, Mac.     One reviewer mentioned that the fact Karen wrote that the Barrons and Ryodan \\"liked\\" Mac's mom's cooking when Barrons and his men don't eat, sleep, etc.  Perhaps they were just being POLITE to Mrs. Lane to make her feel comfortable in the setting they placed her in?  I thought it was kind of charming and unexpected behavior out of these two totally deadly males.    You can't really say a lot about this book without ruining it for other readers, so I'll just say I really liked it and would recommend it and that I am HOPING Karen continues to evolve this series.  Would love to know more about Ryodan for instance, and the continuing story of Barrons and Mac.  Seriously, this series should be made into movies the way Twilight was.  Just imagine Barrons on a big screen.......
B002ZG98UK|5.0|There was in my opinion, very good 3D effects throughout movie. The movie was pretty good too. I like a 3D movie to have as much (come out at you effects) as possible. Sometimes I don't pay real close attention to the plot... that's just me, If you say a movie is in 3D, I expect to see a lot of effects. This movie for sure has it. On some occassions it did'nt need the effects, but I still rather see more than hardly any. I'd say get it!!!

B003ZYU3TG|1.0|Before someone else has to learn the hard way, I wanted to point out that this is NOT the original theatrical release of Modern Times, but the hack-job edited version Chaplin put together later in his career to appeal to the resurgence crowd. It's rather shameful that this isn't noted on the packaging. If that's is the version you prefer, than you'll be happy. The restoration is lovely, and most of the edited parts are available as bonus features. But for those who want to see this film as it was original released, it's best to look elsewhere.

B001D8W7CW|4.0|Carrie is a bona fide horror classic. They don't make horror movies like Carrie anymore. In my opinion, it's one of the best Brian De Palma movies. I recently bought the blu ray and I enjoy it very much. HD losless sound and picture quality are great. However, I am disappointed by the lack of special features. There are no special features on this blu ray. I think they really should have included a director's commentary and making of featurette which have come to be standard special features nowawadays. It's a shame that they chose not to include any bonus features. I also recently purchased A NightMare on Elm St. Blu ray and they did a great job with with special features. They should have done the same with Carrie. If you want to get the ultimate version, you may wait for another edition (I saw a 2-disc version on Amazon.com and I don't know the difference). This review is for the single disc blu ray version.
B003UBTX72|5.0|Reading this puts you in the presence of a kind, insightful, and funny guy, with the calmest demeanor, that makes feel like you're reading a book written by a friend.

B00005V7CT|2.0|Wonderful cast, costumes, setting-what is wrong with this picture? It's a non-movie, that's what. Sooo disappointed. I don't like making up my own endings. It's as if the director called \\"cut,\\" because he lost interest.
B003UESJH4|5.0|[This review is for the theatrical release.]<br /><br />First Impressions:<br /><br />The King's Speech was surprisingly good!  I was surprised because usually these historic dramas tend to be dry & boring with only a history aficionado really appreciating the time period shown or the characters being presented, whether in good light or bad.<br /><br />The film does not concentrate on the whole of history or England's errors and falling into war against Germany and I'm glad it does not.  That's been done.  It's a story of a reluctant prince and later, a reluctant king who through good luck or bad, and thanks to the support of his sympathetic wife, comes upon an Australian speech therapist.<br /><br />Except this speech therapist has been trained in the \\"school of hard knocks\\" during the First World War.  His techniques are unusual and usually very effective.  His most effective method is to make friends with his patient.  But how do you make friends with a monarch?<br /><br />Film Style:<br /><br />If you've any training at all in film technique, you will be amazed at the tension drawn with angles, cuts and positioning.  \\"Bertie\\" (the prince) is almost always presented in the lower left of the screen and Logue is almost always placed at the right, in an unusual display that draws the eye to a corner of the screen.  This is a visual representation of the tension between the two characters which is quite amazing and not a technique you normally see in modern films, as you would in the old Hollywood films.  It was refreshing to see.<br /><br />Plots!<br /><br />The subplots are all suppressed in favor of the story between reluctant friends as they struggle to cure the prince of his speech impediment, made more urgent by the fact that the prince's brother is abdicating the throne to marry a woman (quite the scandal at the time) and the prince, now king, needs to be able to speak well as the country falls into war with Germany.<br /><br />And let's not forget the music!  The classic greats of Beethoven, Mozart and Brahms are prominent.  Great soundtrack!<br /><br />The emotions run high at times which I found refreshing.  The \\"R\\" rating for vulgar language is undeserved and prevents younger teenagers from enjoying this film -- language they hear in the schoolyard all the time!<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />An unusual presentation of an unusual time in English and Western history.  The struggle between friends is reflected in England's struggle against Hitler's march across Europe.<br /><br />The newsreel of Hitler's speech is unnerving and you can see the man's power.  The prince's daughter turns to her father and says \\"What is he saying, Daddy?\\"  The prince says, \\"I don't know, but it says it rather well.\\"  The king needs to say something just as \\"well\\" to rally the country.  Can he do it?  And with the help of an untrained Australian speech therapist and failed actor?  Quite a story!<br /><br />Cast & Crew:<br /><br />  * Colin Firth - King George VI<br />  * Geoffrey Rush - Lionel Logue<br />  * Helena Bonham Carter - Queen Elizabeth<br />  * Guy Pearce - King Edward VIII<br />  * Timothy Spall - Winston Churchill<br />  * Derek Jacobi - Archbishop Cosmo Lang<br />  * Jennifer Ehle - Myrtle Logue<br />  * Michael Gambon - King George V<br />  * Tom Hooper - Director<br />  * Emile Sherman - Producer.

B0012GTZC0|5.0|I just started Follett's 'Eye of the Needle.' I also just finished it! It's been years since I've stumbled across a book which I just could not put down. 'Eye of the Needle' was like that for me. I read the entire novel in two days (very fast considering it normally takes me a couple of weeks for a book its size), and was thrilled to the last page. Here's why.<br /><br />My first Follett experience was (like many people, I suspect), 'Pillars of the Earth.' There's a fantastic book for you if you're into history, particularly Medieval England. Lots of twists and turns, deep and dynamic characters, and plenty of action -- at least enough to keep me occupied. When I read its sequel, 'World Without End,' I came away still pleased with the work, but without the sentiment of \\"I must read that novel again, and right away!\\" It was good, but not great -- worth the read, but I could've lived without it. That being said, I was hesitant when I started 'Eye of the Needle' for two reasons. First, my experience with Follett being limited to his Dark Ages novels, I wasn't quite sure how he would stand up in a more modern era of historical fiction. And second, as 'Pillars' and 'World Without End' seemed to have been much more widely known (or at least publicized), I don't think I had ever heard anything (reviews good or bad) about his WWII stuff.<br /><br />That lengthy soliloquy being stated, if you are: 1) A Follett fan 2) A WWII history fan 3) A general historical fiction fan or 4) Just a fan of good fiction... You MUST read this novel!<br /><br />Characteristic of Ken Follett's work, the characters are believable and dynamic. That's my first major \\"Thumbs Up.\\" Whether the scenario involves: the spy killing a seemingly innocent character, or the housewife bedding the antagonist, or the professor deciding to go 'all in' and work for British military intelligence... I personally felt that, given similar circumstances, being in that character's shoes, I probably would have taken similar actions. There are spots in the book which seem a little thin (i.e., Godliman once met Faber at Canterbury Cathedral before the war, etc etc), but they are small enough, and spread out enough, that they don't have a negative impact on the work. I confess (call me slow-witted if you will), that I had absolutely no clue how Storm Island would play out, how the lives of David and Lucy would eventually connect, to the main plot of the novel -- at least not until I found myself out at see with Faber.<br /><br />Perhaps the best part of the book, for me, the most memorable part, is the battle between David and Faber on the island. The setting is (more or less) in the \\"Eye\\" of a storm -- rain is pouring, no chance for help to arrive in the foreseeable future, Faber has just slept with David's wife, David has just found out the truth about Faber, etc etc... The reason this scene struck me so hard was because David is supposed to be the protagonist; Faber is supposed to be the bad-guy. But during their battle, I found myself rooting for Faber, the German spy whose intelligence report could win the war for Nazi Germany! I don't know how, but Follett had me so twisted around that I wasn't sure which character I should stand behind! David is portrayed as such a bitter and resentful man, and Faber as such a smooth-talking and tough anti-hero, that the roles get seemingly reversed. Really threw me for a loop -- I physically had to set down my Kindle and take a moment to think about it. Again, call me dull if you will, but I credit Follett's writing for my confusion!<br /><br />I'll end this review, which has probably been far too long since the first paragraph, by saying this. If you have never read a Ken Follett book, start with this one! It will get you hooked, and itching for the next one. I know I am.<br /><br />Cheers!ilar actions.

0446195529|1.0|I don't believe that I have read any of this author's previous work, and this book was a gift, so I came to it with an open mind. None of the characters had any real substance, and the author failed to create that all-important bond between this reader and the main character(s).  The book is full of twists, turns and dead ends - many of them contributing nothing to the story as far as I could see - merely serving to pad out a rather short story. There are also too many characters in this book. The central plot, however, was quite clever (not giving anything away), although it took a long time to unveil it.   I know it's a work of fiction, but credulity was stretched quite a bit: although we're told that the central character, Stone, trusts no-one, he seems to seriously misjudge - and quickly trust - some of the individuals who come his way as the action unfolds; although these \\"Camel Club\\" people all seem to be as poor as church mice they have access to all sorts of fancy (expensive?) technology; the speed with which information came to hand was not credible, even in this instant-access internet world we live in.  Three-quarters of the book is quite tedious and it only takes off towards the end. And the final twist (after about four \\"final\\" twists) is nonsense.

031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards should have been dead many times over, yet somehow he survives while the young punks who would claim his throne as the drugged-out Guitar God of Rock fall by the wayside. How come? Well, according to Keef, he gets only the best drugs. Also, he's a very hard worker.<br /><br />\\"Life\\" is by no means perfect, but it doesn't have to be; it's refreshinly honest, something that you would hope from other luminaries of rock music's past and present but really don't expect when publicists and agencies often control what a celebrity says. Richards has laid bare the past almost seventy years of his life to show us the lonely kid who grew up to be one half of the Other Great Songwriting Duo of the Sixties (behind those guys from Liverpool that you may have heard of), as well as a genuine survivor of all the excesses that his particular lifestyle and profession can offer. He's candid about his drugs abuse, his attempts to maintain a relationship and a family while constantly being on the road, and his near-death experiences and the friends he lost along the way (Gram Parsons perhaps being the most famous of the \\"Friends of Keith\\" now pushing up the daisies). Through it all, he writes in a rambling fashion that grows on you.<br /><br />The story of the Stones is here, of course; Mick and Keith's first meeting, first songwriting session (in manager Andrew Loog Oldham's kitchen), and the first rush of success, followed by the conquest of America, the death of Brian Jones, the horror of Altamont, and the excess surrounding \\"Exile on Main Street.\\" If you're looking for a blow-by-blow account of the Stones' career, sorry. This is Keith's story, and the Stones play the biggest role (especially the on-again, off-again partnership with Glimmer Twin Mick Jagger). But I found his descriptions of his childhood and his time as a solo artists in the late Eighties just as interesting as the stories behind \\"Satisfaction\\" and Altamont. The fact is, he's more than just the guitarist in the World's Greatest Rock and Roll Band, and \\"Life\\" fills out that portait.<br /><br />Like the best rock memoirs (John Densmore's \\"Riders on the Storm\\" and John Lydon's \\"Rotten\\"), \\"Life\\" isn't content to rest on the oft-repeated tales of debauchery, though those crop up. The real meat is the parts of the story you didn't know, and Keith is a great tour guide to some of the highs (and highs) of his life. The man speaks the truth, and he's damn entertaining at it. A hard skill to acquire, for sure, but Keef has it in spades.<br /><br />So do yourself a favor and get \\"Life\\".

B003O86FMW|5.0|If you read the first one and enjoyed it, there is no questioning the need to finish the trilogy. The good news here is that each of the books is very strong - I couldn't put them down. Kudos to the author for defining a story line and writing accordingly. The plot and pace for the trilogy are superb. I have started reading series lately where the author will continue to write, not because there is more story to tell or the storyline is being pushed through an arc, but because more books will sell. Buy the series. You will likely finish it wanting more, but be grateful the author had the foresight and fortitude to write a great story in three books, and didn't drag it out with week plots, wide margins, and tedious writing just to make more money.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|This is a great collection of some of Phil Collins' best pop songs.  This isn't my favorite stuff by him-- that would be with Genesis.  For the pop period he had though, this is a very, very good collection.  It's like a time capsule from the 80s.  Just about everything is here.  Really slick production that makes you think he was in the studio for months, crafting every little bit of each song.  If you like that kind of thing, you'll like this album, because every song is like that.
B0041KKYD8|5.0|I bought both the original 1978 and this one on bluray.  I watched the original two days ago and just finished watching this one.  In comparison, the original has more graphic scene.  Camille Keaton gave an outstanding performance.  The remake however, has a better flavor to it.  The revenge scenes on the second one is better than the first.  I really can't say one is better than the other.  IMO, both versions are pretty good.  I thought that the remake is pretty well done.  I've seen alot of remakes and some of them are a dissapointment.  Not this one.  It is worth watching so if you haven't seen this one, I recommend to see the original one first.
B003UESJIS|5.0|I'm not going to give a summary of ANOTHER YEAR because other reviewers have already done that.  I will tell you what I thought about it.  Like THE SOCIAL NETWORK, the thing I liked the most about ANOTHER YEAR was the amazing dialogue.  The actors don't do much in the film, but I understood who they were and what they were like from what they said to eachother.  In some ways, the dialgue reminded me of something Harold Pinter would've written--especially THE HOMECOMING.  Check out the conversation between Mary and Ronnie.  You can tell how awkward and uncomfortable Mary was talking to Ronnie through her dialogue.  To me, that was the brilliance of ANOTHER YEAR.  For a lackluster year, it was definitely one of the best films of the year for moviegoers who appreciate good writing snd acting.  Don't bother seeing it if you have a short attention span.  I'd recommend you see 127 HOURS or BLACK SWAN instead.  But if you like films about the human condition--see this one or BLUE VALENTINE.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I read the first two books of the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and was hooked! I could not wait to get my hands on Mockingjay. But when I finished reading it, I have to admit I wasnt truly satisfied.    I think the beggining could have been better, we find out that Kattnis is now living in district 13, that Cinna, Bonnie, and her friend have died, and that the rebels are starting to gain power all in one or two paragraphs.   The ending is similar. I have to say that I LOVE Peeta and was verry happy that Kattnis chose him, but it dosnt go into detail about that, she just says it as an after thought, also with her kids, it dosnt seem like she is happy about having them, in fact, it seems like she wishes she didnt.    Also, I think the auther should have talked more about some of the deaths. I mean, ONE short paragraph on Finicks death?    But other than that, it was a nice read, not as good as the first two, but a nice ending. I am difinitely looking forwad to Suzanne Collins upcoming work, including the &#34;Hunger Games&#34; movie!
B00006F7S4|1.0|have I been so repulsed by someone's singing voice, and it's so much worse when (as here) the person singing (Beck) thinks he's sounding really great and revels in it. He doesn't; and he's not a guy who should be relying on his vocals.   Others call it a narcoleptic drone but that doesn't convey the sickening sense I got that Beck is immensely self-satisfied with the sound coming out of his mouth.  I cannot begin to fathom the people (and evidently Rolling Stone magazine) who raved about this CD  -- do they allow family members to write reviews for Amazon?  Beck's agents?    A few nice moments with the cellos, but other than that, please let me sell you my copy of Sea Change.  In fact, send me postage and it's yours, FCFS.  BTW I own and like Odelay.

B000003CMD|5.0|After losing 2 founding members, 1973's \\"Brothers and Sisters\\" was the first release of the new Allman Brothers Band. Keyboardist Chuck Leavell gave a different sound than Duane Allman, and Lamar Williams replaced Berry Oakley 2 songs into the record after Oakley's death.  Whether by accident or design, a different style emerged here.  Gregg Allman released his excellent solo record \\"Laid Back\\" in 1973 and some of his songs he was writing at the time were used for the solo record. So there was a need for more songs from someone else and Dickey Betts more than filled the bill.  Allman's \\"Wasted Words\\" and \\"Come and Go Blues\\" are excellent but it is the songs of Betts that carry this record. \\"Ramblin Man\\", \\"Jessica\\" and \\"Southbound\\" are all Betts at his best. Interestingly, this LP became even more popular than the earlier releases with Duane and a surprise #1 record. It may be just a slight notch below the Duane records but it is still one of the best releases from any band in the 70's.

B0049GYXDG|4.0|\\"I'm going to be late...very late\\" is a quote from Alice in Wonderland that I think I have heard almost all my life.  Alice in Wonderland has captured the hearts of generations because Alice's dream seems so real yet so different from she is used to.  Alice is a child who is being pressured to act and enjoy things that older children enjoy and her dream puts her into the world of childhood fun and adventure.  Alice in Wonderland has now released for its 60th Anniversary on Blu-ray with never before seen parts and stunning color.<br /><br />Synopsis: ALICE IN WONDERLAND is a story about a young girl who grows bored listening to her older sister read aloud from a history book about William I of England. While dozing off, she dreams about falling down a rabbit hole (\\"Wonderland\\") that is populated by a peculiar series of misadventures. The always sensible Alice whirls through a world of contradictions, imagination and surprises where she encounters amazing creatures - including a pocket watch-toting White Rabbit, the imperious Queen of Hearts and her army of playing cards, a Cheshire Cat with a lingering smile in an unforgettable fantasy, and the off-kilter Madhatter - and tests her sensibility and courage. In the end it's all a dream, she is awakened by her sister's voice, and as the two of them return home for teatime where she realizes that perhaps logic and reason exist for purpose. And in return, her sister realizes affectionately that Alice is still young, but will grow-up in time.<br /><br />Brand-New Blu-ray Features:<br /><br />  * Through the Keyhole: A Companion's Guide to Wonderland - View the movie in this special mode and discover references to the original Lewis Carroll classic. Kathryn Beaumont introduces.<br /><br />  * Disney View - Watch the movie in this expanded viewing experience with new Disney art in the wings of the screen.<br /><br />  * Painting the Roses Red Game - Help paint the roses red in the Queen's garden. Careful, or someone could lose their head.<br />  * Walt Disney Color TV Introduction (1959) - A never-before-seen color TV intro by Walt.<br />  * Reference Footage: Alice and the Doorknob - Kathryn Beaumont, the voice of Alice, provides an introduction to this newly discovered reference footage of Alice talking to the doorknob.<br /><br />  * Pencil Test: Alice Shrinks - Kathryn Beaumont introduces a newly discovered pencil test of Alice shrinking.<br /><br />Plus, Classic Features:<br /><br />  * \\"I'm Odd\\" Newly Discovered Cheshire Cat Song + Intro<br />  * Thru the Mirror Mickey Mouse Animated Short (Now in Hi-Def)<br />  * Art Gallery (with new design and new images)<br />  * Reflections on Alice<br />  * Operation Wonderland (Now in Hi-Def)<br />  * One Hour in Wonderland<br />  * An Alice Comedy: Alice's Wonderland<br />  * Original Theatrical Trailers (1951 & 1974)<br />  * Walt Disney TV Introduction (1954 & 1964)<br />  * The Fred Waring Show (Excerpt)<br /><br />Deleted Materials:<br /><br />  * Deleted Scene: Pig and Pepper<br />  * From Wonderland to Neverland: The Evolution of a Song - An entertaining look at how a song originally written for Alice in Wonderland, finally found its home in another Disney favorite, Peter Pan.<br />  * Deleted Storyboard Concept: Alice Daydreams in the Park - Deleted storyboard sequence set to music.<br />  * Original Song Demos: \\"Beware The Jabberwock\\"; \\"Everything Has A Useness\\"; \\"So They Say\\"; \\"Beautiful Soup\\"; \\"Dream Caravan\\"; \\"If You'll Believe In Me\\"<br /><br />Movie Download Bonus Features (SD & HD):<br /><br />  * Pencil Test: Alice Shrinks<br /><br />  * Thru The Mirror Mickey Mouse Animated Short<br /><br />  * Reflections on Alice<br /><br />My Opinion:  It had been a long time since I had seen Alice in Wonderland and viewing it from the eyes of an adult versus a child made the movie watching completely different for me.  The White Rabbit has always been my favorite character.  His veracity for time makes him lovable yet obnoxious.  It made me think that the White Rabbit really relates to many adults as we rush around with our time lines and agendas.  We never have time to play and enjoy life.<br /><br />Alice shrinking has always been a favorite part for me especially as a child because I dreamed of being a smaller size and entering a different world other than my own.  The Queen of Hearts also scared me as a child and I believe that a small child could definitely still be afraid of both the Queen of Hearts and the Mad Hatter.  It is not a movie that my children any time soon because of their age and lack of understanding.  I love how Alice's sister realizes that Alice is still just a child and not to rush her into adulthood.  This is something that I need to remember as I work with my children.<br /><br />Disney has taken Alice in Wonderland to new heights of color, sound, and quality by putting her on Blu-ray.  I loved seeing the movie in a new way.  This special edition with its new games and special intro by Walt is definitely a great addition to collector's edition and for those who have never seen the classic Alice in Wonderland.time to play and enjoy life.

0545123267|5.0|I am a Twilight fan, and that's how I came across Shiver. But if you are expecting something that is really similar to Meyer's Saga, you will be surprised.   For me, Shiver surpasses Twilight.   It has a beautiful romance, yes it does. It has drama, yeap, that too. But it has suspense. Tension.   You feel the heat and the cold along with the characters, Grace is far, far more interesting than Bella, and Sam... Well, Sam is as awesome and sad as Edward is, but not to the point of being stalkerish (which was tiresome for me.)  This will keep you on your toes in a wonderful way. I can't wait to read the rest.
B0000X61VE|5.0|My boyfriend gave me an old VHS of this and I did it for fun. It soon became the ONLY workout DVD that I consistently came back to when I didn't have time for the gym, traveling, or I just needed some good toning.     The specific exercises target my muscles in such a way that I see and feel the effects immediately. I also find that the exercises stretch me in such a way that I feel a sense of balance when I'm done with them. (Not to the degree of a yoga class, but still great.)     I finally upgraded to the DVD after many years of the old VHS and I am STILL doing these three workouts. The arms day is a little easier and quicker than the chest and back.

B0000X61UU|5.0|Easy to follow, as it's not aerobics or dance, but still challenging in a great way! I LOVE the Cindy Crawford workout DVD. LIke her first one, I find the exercises that Radu and her do, incredibly effective and I can see the results immediately. This one makes me sweat a bit more than the others. It's longer and more intense and I so I don't do it as much as her other DVD's because I use DVD's in general when I don't have the time to go to the gym. There's a longer legs segment in the beginning of this one, with more jumping so be careful if you live in a building with neighbors below you. (it's just a little and the rest of the workout is still worth the buy)     I feel like I'm stretching while I do many of these exercises- it feels that good! I strongly recommend this awesome video!

0061433047|5.0|I love Pratchett's \\"Tiffany Aching\\" novels. This one is another installment in her adventures, and is perhaps one of Pratchett's wittiest and most delightfully satirical novels in recent years.<br /><br />I think the Witches have always been among Pratchett's most popular characters, and Tiffany is almost a glimpse into what Granny Weatherwax may have been like in her early years. I remember reading in an interview a few years ago that Pratchett finds Granny Weatherwax difficult to plot for, since she's such a complex character whose development has taken on a life of it's own. Tiffany Aching is a fresh, young version of Granny, as she may have been years ago.<br /><br />'I Shall Wear Midnight' is amazingly well crafted, and incorporates so many of Pratchett's most beloved characters (in cameo) flawlessly. I read this novel in one night because i HAD to get to the end.

B003L77GG0|5.0|Smallville has always been one of my faverote shows of all time. I discovered it back in 2004 when it first aired on ABC family, and has loved it ever since. With each season, we see clark getting a year closer to becoming superman, and now in season 10, we see that happen. In season 10, clark must put away his fears and deal with the darkness within before he reaches that point of becoming who he is to be.              The one thing that truely stands out in season 10 from anything else is the cemistry between Clark and Lois. In the first five seasons, Clark was intrested in Lana. That was good for the time being, but I feel that Lana should have left the show after season 5, so that the Clark/Lois connection could have started eariler then it did in season 8. I hate thhat the show is ending because I feel that it will end with several cliffhangers because of the events that have already unfolded.  I don't want to give to much away but I will say that season 10 is the best season ever.     Edit: To the ones who are wondering why he hasn't flown yet or why he isn't wearing the suit. You must remember that the story follows clark kent BEFORE he's superman. His flying and wearing the suit happens after he becomes superman.
0312330537|5.0|I was not even aware that this book was based on a true story, but this is an adventure which is rare in books. I read that Roberts took 13 years to write this book and they are making a movie out of it staring Johnny Depp. Horrible casting you ask me, as much as I like the guy.    The story takes you on an adventure in Mumbai India and the extraordinary life led by Roberts.    This was a book that gave me bad dreams I have to say. That's a good thing. I couldn't put it down.    Highly recommend this read.
B003GK22HA|5.0|I have to say that this book hits the mark from every angle. The writer takes you into ancient Egypt to the point where the book just flows and you don't even realize that you are reading. The characters are so well defined and I found myself hating the bad guys with so much passion.    The writing style of Wilbur Smith has always been easy to read and this book doesn't disappoint either. The book is action all the way, you have to stop to breathe.    The only good thing about coming to the end of this book is that Warlock awaits.    Exciting, thrilling and spellbinding. My compliments to the author.

I need not explained the sexual revolution and the rise in drug use in the 1960s: the whole culture of the west became to the highest power more dirty, more frightening, more elicit.<br /><br />We can debate if rock and roll caused this or was an exponent of the change, but it really does not matter. Whatever, rock was seen by most in churchgoing America as a truly scary beast, more so as the culture changed.<br /><br />\\"Love Love Love\\" The Beatles sang--and the Rolling Stones would have none of it. They were dirty and drugged and sexed by whoever they pleased and just didn't care. Except to shove everything that scared you  right in your face on twelve black vinyl inches.<br /><br />\\"I've got nasty habits,\\" declares Mick Jagger on \\"Live With Me.\\" Jagger here presents himself as a drugged out, child abusing king, with a ticket to do whatever pleases him. \\"Crazy Horse,\\" here referrers to heroin, which he uses with the stripping maid.<br /><br />This was 1970s indulgence before the decade even began. The Stones, as presented here, were certainly not part of the establishment, but they were not marching for peace or eating granola. They were the lawless with money and power. God save the queen, God save the Red White and Blue from these amoral savage mongers. There were riots in the streets, riots on campus, murder riots on Spawn Ranch,  and now, riots on record. All of a 1969 piece.<br /><br />Now when you talk 60s Rolling Stones you're talking blues,R&B: all that which many whitebreads still considered \\"race music.\\" Even the country here is out of the African American idiom. The Stones were selling America the culture of the people America was resisting assimilating into the culture--and yeah, their were riots in the street over that, too.<br /><br />Listen to Merry Clayton's shout on 'Gimmie Shelter.\\" The Stones open Let It Bleed talking about the sheer danger and exhaustion of it all. The playing here, as on the entire album, is detailed and complex--listen to the percussion alone. Listen to the druggy, shimmering guitar. Or hear how, on the title track, Jagger seeks refuge with a little \\"coke and sympathy.\\" with the girl he can \\"cream on.\\"  Jagger's cry in the thick of the storm, the 1960s at their darkest, is for more indulgence, more chaos.<br /><br />Listen to \\"Midnight Rambler\\"--a fuzz bass ode to murder. These were the days of Nixon dropping millions in  napalm on Vietnam, of Manson sending scads of cult hippies to slaughter the rich, of Kennedys and Kings shot point blank. What more were the sadistic prowlings of a knife wielding maniac. These were WITCHY times, and the folk tale of the \\"Midnight Rambler\\" seemed to fit the backdrop perfectly.<br /><br />Or listen to the pristine slide guitar of \\"Love In Vain,\\" or the sheer blues of Richards singing \\"You Got The Silver.\\" The Stones tranending the form they mastered. \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want,\\" is rockified blues brought to a classical grand sweep, complete with choir. \\"I went down to the demonstration, to get my fair share of abuse,\\" may be one of the tamer lines on Let It Bleed.<br /><br />With Jagger at peek form, Richards and Mick Taylor the essence of blues playing, and help from friends like Nicky Hopkins and Bobby Key's, this is rock at its most distilled.

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Having made a strong impression two years ago as Charlize Theron's younger guilt-ridden self in Guillermo Arriaga's [[ASIN:B002S5N052 The Burning Plain]], Jennifer Lawrence brings such a primal, haunting stillness to her performance that she singlehandedly transcends the dispirited tone of director/co-writer Debra Granik's small-scale regional 2010 film. At first, the movie, co-written by Granik and Anne Rosellini, appears to concern itself with the spartan existence of a dirt-poor family in the Missouri Ozarks, but it turns into a far more personal story of one girl's intractable dedication to her family and how she faces life-threatening challenges in keeping her family home together. This is much more a tale of survival than spiritual uplift because 17-year-old Ree Dolly has to care for her two younger siblings while contending with a near-catatonic mother and a meth-making father who has apparently disappeared.<br /><br />Even though she harbors dreams of entering the military to secure the $40,000 promised in the recruiting ads, Ree has to deal with the harsh reality that her father has put up their house as collateral for his bail. If he doesn't show up for a trial in a week's time, dead or alive, they will lose everything. She is determined to find his whereabouts from his criminal relatives and associates despite the fact that she gets the same constant warning to mind her own business or face the consequences. In fact, her stubbornness is at such odds with tribal ties and local customs that she faces revelations she could not possibly be prepared to handle. While Ree remains undaunted in her search for the truth, she also discovers how she cannot break entirely free of her surroundings.<br /><br />Just as she did with an unknown Vera Farmiga as a coke-addicted mother in 2004's [[ASIN:B000I0QL7I Down to the Bone]], Granik extracts a sharply realistic, emotionally precise performance out of Lawrence. For example, when she listens to the soldier tell her to stay home to care for her family, she registers her character's resignation in a most economically searing manner. In smaller roles, John Hawkes etches a menacing presence as Teardrop, Ree's meth addict uncle who brutally warns her that her father may be dead, as does Dale Dickey as a plain-spoken woman who turns out to have more in common with Lady Macbeth. Michael McDonough's stark cinematography captures the bleakness of the rough, depressing terrain. The 2011 DVD/Blu-Ray includes a robust commentary track from Granik and McDonough, an informative 45-minute making-of feature, an alternate opening scene, and four deleted scenes.for her family, she registers her character's resignation in a most economically searing manner.

B0037UUZQY|1.0|I ordered this product WEEKS before Christmas and never received it. After contacting Amazon I was told that because it was sold through another store they weren't able to say why it was taking so long to ship....likely it was due to the high popularity since the movie had just come out.....so the order was cancelled and I was then unable to find another Tangled doll to get my niece for Christmas. I was pretty bummed as I had taken her to see the movie as a special day for her birthday and wanted to follow up with a doll for her. Amazon was great about providing a speedy refund, etc. but I may have been able to order another Tangled doll if I had known this one was not going to ship in a timely manner.
1883217040|5.0|This book is a must for every jazz lover. Its very fine for beginners and advanced musicians. Very handy with ring binding. I read a lot of jazz books. However, this is like a \\"bible\\" in jazz theory.
0545123275|3.0|Shiver, the first book of The Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, is about a girl, Grace and a werewolf, Sam. It's a touching love story between a wolf boy that saved Grace from a brutal wolf attack when she was young. Since then she hasn't been able to get the startling yellow eyes out of her mind and has been obsessed with the wolves that roam outside in the woods by her house.     The love story is definitely intriguing and romantic, though a little rushed in the beginning. You are introduced to Grace's obsession with the wolf that saved her and when she finds that he is human, she seemed to take it all in stride with really no surprised reaction as if she had anticipated it to begin with.     The relationship is then grown showing that they are learning about each other but the timing of all of this takes place within a couple of months. It's surprising to see a couple fall in love so quickly and can't bear to be apart but I guess that's where the similarities with Twilight come in.     Sam is fighting between his supernatural state and human state. He despises being a wolf but wasn't given a choice to become one, a la Edward Cullen. He can also read people well without the mind reading ability. And he has yellow eyes. Hmmm ...     The wolves in this story are just regular wolves though with healing abilities and they don't have supernatural powers or anything.     There is a bit of intrigue and mystery surrounding the wolves and why they become wolves and if there is a cure. The real action begins closer toward the end of the story where Sam is resisting to become a wolf afraid to be stuck in his wolf form forever. And as the winter draws closer, you're left wondering what will happen.     It was a quick read and I enjoyed it. It still sparked my interest and I thought that the relationship between Sam and Grace was cute. I was also wondering the whole time what was going to happen as the winter got closer and it was Sam's last year to turn. It does have angst toward the end but you're left with a surprising ending.     I'm planning to finish this series but I might wait until the last book comes out next year so I can finish the next two at one time.
0553154540|5.0|What an absolute joy this book is. If your only exposure to this is through the films, you really owe it to yourself to give this a read at some point. The story is pretty familiar to anyone at this point - the eccentric chocolate factory owner, the golden tickets, the four bratty children and the one impoverished good child, the gleefully bizarre fates and sights inside...is there anyone who isn't at least passingly familiar with the story? But the story itself is absolutely packed with treats, and first and foremost is Dahl's wonderful imagination that's on display on every single page. Charlie's a fable, no doubt; there's some heavy satire going on, and a lot of points about children and their parents as the real cause of many of their problems and issues. But reading it with my son was a nice way to remember just how wondrous and imaginative the entire work is, and watching his eyes widen and his jaws drop with some of the sights in the book was an absolute joy. And, as an adult, it's fun to see Dahl's sharp sense of humor shining through, most notably through the songs of the Oompa Loompas, which have a nasty, twisted wit to them. From the wonderful sketch drawings to the memorable characters, it's no wonder that Charlie is the classic that it is; what's nice is remembering just how much of that comes from the book rather than the movies.
0547258305|5.0|Graceling, is a story about a girl, Katsa, an eighteen year old Graceling and her special ability. She is a lady killer and feared among everyone living within the seven kingdoms. As a thug of Randa, King of the Middluns, she struggles with right and wrong and a sense of her own independence.     The beginning of the story, immediately captured my attention with a mysterious mission that you follow Katsa on. Someone has been kidnapped and Katsa is trying to find out why he was kidnapped. On her mission, she mets another Graced fighter, Po, who intrigues her making her wonder who this person is and what he is all about.     You soon find out that Katsa is part of a secret group that she formed called the Council. The Council was setup to achieve balance among the royal power of the seven kingdoms. They work on missions to ensure that the kings are not abusing their powers and soon you're following Katsa on her mission to unravel the mysterious kidnapping.     In this fantastical world that Kristin Cashore creates, you're immediately thrown into a story of a strong heroine as she learns about herself, love, friendship and sacrifice.     The romance in this story is touching and I enjoyed reading about Katsa's incredible journey. I would highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to immerse yourself in a unique world where select humans have special abilities, hence, known as Gracelings, and a twisted world of kings and power with castles, dungeons, and sword-fighting.
0307472590|5.0|I didn't know the writer before purchasing this product/ who is absolutely brilliant. His method of writing makes you feel \\"being a part of the happenings\\". You become one of them.
0439023521|5.0|Suzanne Collins creates a unique and twisted world of Panem seen through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen. A 16-year old girl who was forced to grow up early and take care of her family by hunting for food (illegally) in a world where starvation is the norm. The Annual Hunger Games starts up and Katniss is thrown into an arena to fight for her life.     I was initially shocked at the violence that the story creates around the Hunger Games. 24 kids (called tributes) are chosen from 12 districts. One boy and one girl aged anywhere from 12 to 18. They are to fight to the death until there is only one left standing. And the disturbing part is that the entire world of Panem is forced to watch this for their enjoyment.     The idea of something so horrible makes you sick but you are glued into wanting to read every page of this book. You want to know what happens next as each chapter leaves off on a suspenseful note. In addition to that, there is love thrown in and yet, what happens if you end up having to kill each other off?     The book is really good. Definitely one of my favorites. I absolutely enjoyed every page of it. The twists and suspense has you on edge every minute.
B003L20IFQ|3.0|I really like Ryan Reynolds and he was great in this movie. I enjoyed the movie but got a little bored. I wish they had more of a story line outside of the coffin. The whole film is 1 actor, 1 scene. I would have enjoyed the storyline leading up to the moment Ryan Reynolds character was put in the coffin. Overall good but definitely a rental movie rather than a purchase as I can not see myself watching it again.
1416972250|4.0|After having finished both City of Bones and City of Ashes, I decided to continue reading and finishing up the rest of the Mortal Instruments series. There is also a sort of cliffhanger in City of Ashes which makes you want to read City of Glass.     The book follows up with Clarissa Fray, being told that there is a way to wake her mother up from her coma. She has to travel to Idris to find a warlock who has placed her mother under a spell.     You follow Clary and her journey into Idris which is not an easy journey and forbidden since she has entered Idris illegally along with Luke, a werewolf Shadowhunter, who is sort of like her father figure.     From there she meets a cast of new characters. She is introduced to Sebastian, another Shadowhunter who is mysterious and willing to help her but things don't seem right about him. She also meets Amatis, Luke's sister and some other Council members, in which some have been corrupted by Valentine.     I did get frustrated again with Clary for being irrational and making stupid decisions but in a way she has to be like that in order to find herself stuck in certain situations in the book.     There is a lot going on in this third book of the series. You're constantly wondering what will happen next as Clary and Jace unravel more and more secrets about their past and their family history while trying to stop Valentine from completing his task of eliminating the world of Downworlders and creating a pure race of Shadowhunters.     There is still the growing relationship between Jace and Clary in which it's difficult to think of them being brother and sister and yet they have a strong bond to each other. Overall, I was originally turned off by their relationship from the first book where I didn't want to continue reading the series because I thought it was disturbing but after reading some spoilers online and finding out that they aren't actually brother and sister, it made me want to continue with reading the rest of the series. I did enjoy reading this last book because you find out all the hidden secrets and what really happened and everything comes full circle at the end.    I thought there was a lot of intrigue and the constant movement of things happening that there wasn't a boring moment or slow moment that would've turned me off from it. This last book did a great job in answering a lot of unanswered questions from the first two books.     I was surprised to find out that there is now six books in this series and that the fourth book is scheduled to come out in the Spring. It seems as if this third book really ended on a good note but if there is still more, I am interested in continuing to read it.

0545140323|4.0|Penny Lane Bloom, a sixteen year old girl named after a Beatles song, has had her heart broken repeatedly. She turns to The Beatles to help her with her coping and then decides to give up on boys and creates the Lonely Hearts Club with her friends. It becomes a safe haven for girls to come together and focus on friendship and more. The club decides to give up on dating until they graduate high school but what happens when Penny starts to grow feelings for someone. A good guy and not someone like all the other guys at her school. Will she abide by the Club's rules? Will she disappoint her friends?     I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Lonely Hearts Club. I'm also a Beatles fan so I liked the references and the ties with one of the greatest bands of all time.     You can't but help feel for Penny and the struggles she goes through with trying to be loyal to the club she created but also for her feelings toward a certain someone. I also liked that the girls in the club really focused on trying to change themselves and be who they wanted and not succumbed to the pressures of high school. The focus on friendship being first was great and I liked that the girls stuck to each other throughout the book without all the drama that comes with too many girls being in one place at one time. The book is empowering and I had only wished I had a club like this while I was attending high school.
B00005N6KG|3.0|I like this product, but when I used it while on the treadmill at the gym and plugged it into the outlet on the treadmill to listen to a TV show (tv screen is attached to the treadmill), I realize how short the cord was.  I was disappointed.     Otherwise, I think this product is comfortable and decent sound for the price. If you're using your ipod with a arm band or something, it would be fine.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|A quick and compelling Kindle read. Patti Smith's perspective on life and art was refreshing and enlightening. This book opened my eyes to what was going on in NYC during the 70's, and really helped to explain where Mapplethorpe was coming from with his photography. Patti is so much more than the SNL parody most people associate her with - (Gilda's disturbing, albeit hilarious, 'Candy Slice.') Also, her connections were serendipitous! Truly an intelligent, gifted, and surprisingly compassionate artist/poet/musician.      Smith's incongruous traits make her all the more likable... the earlier chaotic & unkempt demeanor contrasting with her eventual marriage and family. Her shyness vs. her bravado. Both muse and artist.  Robert is no doubt smiling from beyond.

But I found it very realistic in the fact that Antonio \\"CHE\\" knew Madonna \\"EVITA\\" for what she really was and still was there in his own way. She was your modern day gold digger climbing higher and higher on top of man after man to get where she wanted and expected the people to love her anyway. Brilliant acting, singing & design. The music is so unforgettable I just ordered the double soundtrack again as I lost the original I had.

0375842209|5.0|I always scoff at anyone who writes a review before finishing a book...How can you tell me what you thought if you're not even done. I am not finished, I have a long way to go, and I couldn't hold back.  I fell in love on page 1, the prologue. I read more than the average person, and I read a great variety of works. By page 2, I thought I had never read a book like this. I still think I am right. It is so beautifully written. The words truly do paint the story. It's a work of art. I cannot get enough of the flow and usage of the words. I want to soak this book up.  I am confused as to how this is a YA book, though. I was very surprised. As a middle school teacher, I read my fair share of YA and this seems so different, so much more adult in style. SO if you're put off by the categorization, don't be, at all.   That's enough, I have some reading to do... :)
B00000IFP6|2.0|I don't know what's worse, the stodgy-paced renditions of old or the hurry-it-up contemporary ones. When I hear those slow, hulking giants, I can barely stand it. But the newer quickies, of which the Zinman 9th is an example, just make me laugh, then cringe. The 2nd movement does have a great opening rhythm, however. Unfortunately, the winds and brass are not clearly reproduced, robbing the recording of excitement. And at about 6:35, there's a weird speedup that's pretty disconcerting and odd. That section ends at about 8:45 and it's back to the original tempo. The ending of that movement is positively undramatic. As you might expect, the 3rd movement moves along briskly. It kind of changes the mood of the movement to that of a pleasant little trifle. You wouldn't think the composition's anything too special if you'd only heard this rendition. Interestingly, though the speed of playing would imply the end will mercifully come sooner, it seems to go on forever. I'm reminded of a subscription patron that used to sit next to me at the Boston Symphony. When he arrived he immediately began reading the program and didn't stop until the music started, whereupon he fell deeply asleep. One time his wife had to poke him out of a snoring episode. All music must have felt like this movement to him, neverending and saying nothing. The quickie pace continues in the 4th movement, and the playing seems to have no *moment*. The voices appear a good match for the orchestra. The chorus is pretty much a blur in the background. After the little march, the orchestra rushes the singer awfully and pathetically, then continues its racing pace. Then there's a slowdown and one is reminded of the 3rd movement's interminability. The \\"release\\" section plods along... Now back to the rushing voices. And the finale...ends. But wait, there's more! The last movement, starting with the march, plays again, but with some difference. So, if you were really enthralled by the first 4th movement, you'd getan extra treat!    This may be the end of my review. I don't think I have the stamina for the other symphonies.

030746363X|5.0|I was looking for a different diet and exercise book when I happened to pick up The 4-Hour Body.  I had never heard of Timothy Ferriss, but was intrigued by the claims on the back cover.  I ordered the book from Amazon and have since changed my life.  I now eat Slow Carb every day except Saturday (the best day of the week!) when I eat whatever I want. I've lost eight pounds and six inches in the past month. Oh, and I drink lemon juice before each meal, put cinnamon in my coffee, and have a nice bowl of sauerkraut each morning before breakfast. I'm also taking PAGG, but not in the doses recommended.  It made me sick so I had to cut back. I have never felt better.    I had been doing another extreme exercise program six days a week but I was getting burned out and wasn't seeing results anymore.  I was skeptical of just swinging a kettlebell around a few days a week.  I finally purchased one last week and my body is sore in places I didn't know existed.  I'm excited to see the results.    This book is easy to read.  Tim's sense of humor and his way of just saying it as it is is refreshing.  I haven't read every chapter, but I'm going to encourage my husband to read at least one chapter...the 15 minute one.  Just for the sake of science, you know.
B003ZVJFFM|5.0|I put a dvd copy in. I forget what format it was... anyways the quality sucked I could barely see it. I had borrowed it from a friend. Anyways, I went and bought this one once I saved up the cash because I am a huge disney fan and I love A christmas carol. The blu-ray quality is way so much better! I wish I could watch it in 3d! I have recently upgraded to blu-ray in August or around that time. The picture and sound quality is so much better. Of course I've been watching them on my ps3 because my original blu-ray I need to buy a sound cable for. or sound bar I am not sure which one. The sound on the blu-ray picks up so much easier and I can here all of what their saying even if their just whispering. I saw the blu-rays and then went and saw a movie in theater and honestly I'd rather wait for the blu-ray then watch it in theater now even :D

Bummer because we just don't get too much use out of the big sets.  Hopefully they will have more like this!

0393338827|4.0|Michael Lewis's books always enlighten and entertain. His writing style is absorbing. He makes the arcane world of finance accessible, without burying readers in numbers or jargon. He boils things down to essentials, and brings to life key characters.<br /><br />He did it before for the 1980s bond market and for modern baseball. He does it here for the subprime meltdown. He understands the issues, he looks at things with a skeptical eye and he finds sources whose quotes illuminate the scene, with brevity and wit equalling Lewis' own.<br /><br />So why, here, has he failed so egregiously?<br /><br />His story is honest as far as he tells it. The subprime mortgage disaster which wrecked the US economy evolves in two different life cycles - one in the 1990s and the more recent and disastrous one - as various financial sectors develop increasingly complicated ways of packaging debt and laying off risk, creating the sort of \\"everyone-wins\\" scenario essential to bubbles and Ponzi schemes. As they do so, those close to the game - participants, bystanders, analysts - are less and less able to grasp what's going on, are given less and less data, and fail, except for a few oddball prophets who are the book's heroes, to properly interpret what data they do have correctly, to wit: enormous numbers of risky and failing mortgages are a disaster waiting to happen, no matter how creatively the risk is laid off.<br /><br />And, as the plot thickens, the big investment banks get stung by their own sting. Unregulated, opaque, releasing little information about their subprime mortgage bonds and CDOs and in many cases having little themselves, they end up holding billions in shaky investments they'd meant to stick others with.<br /><br />What Lewis can't be forgiven for is his whitewashing of the first principle of this whole mess: the decision at the public, not the private level, that such loans must be made, and more of them, and many more of them, for social justice reasons. This is the epitome of liberal fascism: an expanding government, going where it should stay out, paving the road to hell with its good intentions by forcing its will through the private sector. And the private sector, complying, figures out how to implement the process, making fast and often spurious fortunes in the meanwhile.<br /><br />Lewis mentions Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac only once or twice, in passing. There is no discussion of the government policies that helped create this mess. In a book with this level of detail - where Lewis sorts out and describes the most complicated transactions and the chronology of their downfall on Wall Street, where he makes collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps comprehensible, where he lets you know about Steve Eisman's golf attire and Michael Burry's glass eye - it is an inexcusable lapse.<br /><br />Lewis has an agenda, and this plays no part in it. Disillusioned after a few years' work for Salomon Brothers fresh out of the college in the 1980s, and writing \\"Liar's Poker\\" which made his reputation, he is more interested in tracing elements of the subprime mess to Salomon. One former Salomon trader created the CDO. Another first bundled subprime mortgages. Lewis sees Wall Street as a den of wickedness dating back to this period, gloats over its demise and basically says, \\"See how right I was?\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, he has numerous fine insights - particularly that first Salomon and then the other investment banks going public created this culture, as investment bankers gambled now with stockholders' money rather than their own.<br /><br />And his interweaving of the work of Eisman, Burry, Lippmann, Cornwall Capital and other major players into an effective chronology is magnificent.<br /><br />But what's his political agenda? He seems to sympathize with Eisman's accusation that the financial markets exist to rip off poor people, but other than consumer finance and then the subprime mortgage era they have hardly ever dealt with poor people. And in the subprime era he recounts, their crime appeared to be loaning money to poor people who weren't good for it, who got to live in houses they couldn't have otherwise afforded and in many cases later just walked away from.<br /><br />This book makes a fine case for better regulation. Regulation of bonds similar to that of stocks. Regulation of investment banking similar to that of commercial banking. Regulation of the complicated instruments that led to this disaster, such as capital requirements.<br /><br />But Lewis glosses over what these markets have done year in and year out for decades - package capital, make it available for investment and thereby fuel the economy's growth. He finds those echoing his own bitter position - that this is a horrible and useless thing to do with one's life, that it has no \\"social utility\\" - without considering that the option of doing things with \\"social utility\\" is a luxury primarily enjoyed by the rich or idealistic in an economy where others create the food, clothing, shelter, transport, medicine and new wealth to support loftier pursuits.rime appeared to be loaning money to poor people who weren't good for it, who got to live in houses they couldn't have otherwise afforded and in many cases later just walked away from.

B0030ZOYHC|3.0|So I bought this for my brother who's in his late 20's and loves Anime. Apparently Evangelion is a really big deal as far as Anime goes. We even visited a small Museum in Japan that was entirely dedicated to the show. He had already seen the movie but wanted it on blue ray anyways. I'm personally not into anime that much but felt the movie was about decent. I did however get tired of the main character very quickly. He's suppose to be the hero of the story but wines and cries like a little girl way too much. Bottom line, even though this is a highly rated anime, I've seen better.
B0042816YK|4.0|I'm one of those people who actually really liked this book.  Well, to say it better - I really enjoyed \\"eating\\" and \\"loving\\" - the \\"praying\\" was a little lost on me and seemed a little lengthy in comparison.  I finally got around to watching the movie this past weekend.  I liked it.  It wasn't my favorite movie..... but I thought it was decent.  I do think the book is a LOT better.  It's just too large a subject matter to try to cram into a 2 hour long movie.<br /><br />Julie Roberts was the ideal choice for the main character, Liz.  I thought she brought a lot to the character - after all, this story is based on a real woman's life experiences.  At times, the movie seemed a bit rushed, but again, I think that has more to do with the fact that you're cramming a year long journey into 2 hours of film.<br /><br />A lot of people didn't like the book, and subsequently the movie, because they felt that it was all me, me, me and that the author was self-centered or self-righteous.  Newsflash - the book is a memoir - which is autobiographical writing.  Did those people not realize that?<br /><br />I personally enjoyed the movie - but then again, I really enjoyed the book.  A friend of mine hated the book, but liked the movie - go figure!  It's hard for me to judge because I actually have read the book, but I think I was able to get more out of the movie because I knew a little bit more about what was actually happening - the parts of the story that the movie only touched on or didn't include at all.  My only real disappointment was that the Florence + the Machine song wasn't even in the movie - only the trailer!
0670022411|5.0|This is not your average creature novel. Its engrossing world-within-a-world story line is notable for its mix of historical and science fiction. It pulls the reader into wondrous places - the secret shelves of a world-class library, a perfectly preserved French castle - introduces us to witches and vampires and daemons, tosses in the inevitable cross-species romance, tears us back-and-forth through history, into modern day scientific and evolutionary theory and still manages to keep the story pacing taut throughout. Simply put, it's a tasty, immersive read - highly entertaining, escapist fun. I couldn't put it down.     Sure. If you're a reader of these genres, you'll see the character archetypes and expected plot developments unfold as you've seen before, but you'll also find some nice surprises. Harkness does a fine job of research and storytelling, so if you come to this book open-minded and looking for well-told tale of above-average intelligence and wit, you won't mind at all. Do clear some time for yourself, however. I deep-sixed my life until I finished this novel.    I'd like to point out that many (actually, at this point, nearly ALL) of the negative reviews for A Discovery of Witches are complaining about the ridiculous price of the e-version of this book; this is not at all the fault of the author, and should have zero bearing on the star-rating of the book itself. The star rating is designed to inform prospective readers at-a-glance as to whether or not the book is a worthy read. (As it certainly is.) Complain to Amazon, my fellow reviewers - but don't punish the author and her work.    Meanwhile, I am very much looking forward to the next book in this series.
B0041KKYCY|5.0|Jennifer: (Sarah Butler) is a writer and she needs a little piece and quiet retreating to the solitude of a cabin in the deep country. Some \\"good ole boys\\" (Jeff Branson, Daniel Franzese', Rodney Eastman, Tracy Walter and Andrew Howard.) are about to make all their dreams come true when they rape Jennifer and leave her for dead. Jennifer comes back for a little more of the old \\"in out, in out\\" and will be these perverts worst nightmare!     I Spit On Your Grave is a Remake FROM Steven R. Monroe. Based upon MEIR ZARCHI's 1978 film DAY OF THE WOMAN. From start to finish I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE will leave you breathless and perhaps haunt you for days.       This entire movie is about rape/revenge... It's all pretty super unrealistic in a fantasy sense. Enough cannot be said about the originality and double standard of this films message upon its viewers. Anyone of I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE'S detractors should wake up and smell the coffee; the best plot, pacing and special effects I have seen in the horror genre in a while, especially because it is a remake. I just watched this on Blu-Ray and I have two words for ya... \\"HOLY S---!\\" While this movie lacks in shock value during Jennifer's brutal rape scenes from the original; it makes up for this with Jennifer's Revenge scenes and it accomplishes this in spaids! Most importantly this movie provoked much thought and even as a \\"horror gore-hound\\" had me like the creative kill scenes; while I was cheering for Jennifer I felt a sense of guilt for doing so. They did a really good job and I couldn't have been less or more enthusiastic about what these filmmakers did for a fairly stagnant movie comparing this to the original is pointless... Or is it?       I wonder what I would have thought of this if I had never seen the original. I watched this film with a close friend of mine and he reacted just as I suspected he would. Laughter and \\"tough talk\\" ensued during Jennifer's rape but total confliction and disagree with what Jennifer did and suddenly it wasn't so funny... Hah, ha, ha, haaa. The original is nothing more than a sexploitation film and hardly was anything \\"scary\\". The remake actually made me feel nervous or apprehensive to imagine what Jennifer would do next. It does take the entire \\"underground\\" thrill away from the original; before it was rare to find someone who had seen it. Now \\"I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE\\" should be a mainstream success. This could have been ruined if it were any more sexploitive than it is. The movie worked for me on a very deep emotional level.       Jennifer is quite the dominatrix type and could it be that that's what those men were lacking to begin with? They needed a woman to treat them like the dogs they were or could this just be my own point of view based on a sub-conscience fantasy of my own? Let's be honest here... While I don't enjoy rape all of my male friends agree there is something darkly humorous and slightly enjoyable about watching someone get bent over a rock and sodomized while one of the attackers sets back and plays the harmonica. That is if they're all being honest. Something can be said about a man's primal instinct to laugh or secretly enjoy the sensational sexual situations and then be chastised as a viewer for feeling that way later. Anyone EVER having had thoughts like these and it forces the viewer to see this from a male and female point of view. So, what lets all of us overly aggressive males off the hook? Jennifer's over aggressive retribution. A retribution that is an over dramatized version of every woman who has been raped, ultimate fantasy, regarding revenge against her attacker(s). NONE of this movie is very \\"believable\\". I'm not so sure I agree with Jennifer's methods here on a moral level even as a victim. Hearing someone say \\"help me Jesus\\" would be enough for me to show at least some level of mercy even with a quick bullet to the head. How anyone could live with the guilt of having been so sadistic in the method of rape or revengethe way Jennifer or those men did is unfathomable and it reduces Jennifer to a mere sick and twisted killer like her attackers and nothing more. So what if you think this movie is nothing more than arbitrary filth? What a powerful feeling it is to disagree.       It wasn't hard for me to quickly appreciate the effort put into making a \\"good\\" rape/revenge movie. Awesome kill scenes in this remake and this is where the original lacks. Complex on a strictly imaginative and ingenious level because the kill scenes were something I have not seen before this movie. However, shock value could have been intensified I feel by including more of a sexploitive approach like that of the original because we are living in a sexually desensitized world and I doubt much more than a muffled \\"oh my god\\" would be heard by the viewers. This would have left me with a greater appreciation for what JENNIFER did and perhaps in some ways justified her decision to enact her twisted revenge. Jennifer is every mans worst nightmare and I absolutely love what this fresh new filmmaker did for this movie. That being said... IT'S ALL IN THE SCRIPT and I absolutely loved it!
0545265355|5.0|I bought The Hunger Games trilogy after reading the first book, The Hunger Games. I couldn't put it down. It was amazing - suspenseful, easy to read, interesting story, and captivating characters. I was completely obsessed and highly recommend this to anyone. I finished each book in just over a day and wished there was more.
B00005JLKN|2.0|Now I know that Dino DeLaurntiis passed on recently this isn't ment to be mean at all but back in 1986 Manhunter flopped at the box office for whatever reason De Laurntiis said \\"I do not like Manhunter it is not Red Dragon.\\" So he had no involvment with Silence Of The Lambs but when that movie was a hit he saw money so he produced the sequel which I will admit it was a decent sequel but honestly it would've been like when Hallloween III flopped when John  Carpenter & Deborah Hill stopped producing cause  everybody wanted Michael if you remember.  Then   when H4 was a sucess Carpenter & Hill decided to come back & produce the Halloween movies.   A year & a half later Red Dragon was released many aren't aware that this is a remake of Manhunter based off the novel by Thomas Harris. I say watch Manhunter 1st if you haven't saw either movie. It has a huge cast a great cast great job but that's really it. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Edward Nortan plays Will Graham Ralph Fiennes as Francis Dollarhyde Harvey Kitel as Jack Crawford Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Freddy Lounds. Basically you start off \\"Will Graham is looking for a killer \\"Graham\\" thinks he's figured out he's dealing with a cannibal. So it can't be good \\"Graham\\" finds a book how to cook people while at his friends house Dr Hannibal Lecter. I'm thinking why wasn't this cut it is so predictable cause William Peterson talked about it in Manhunter. Both \\"Graham & Hannibal hurt each other we go to a few years later & FBI director \\"Jack Crawford\\" asks for \\"Graham's\\" help. so he goes looking for a killer named \\"The Tooth Fairy\\" It really does feel like most of the lines are reused from Manhunter like when Ed Nortan says a line the William Peterson delivered much better the way Norton does it & his facial expressions are too laughable. The scene where \\"Graham\\" talks to Hannibal is line for line just like Manhunter. While William Peterson was intemidated by Lecter in Manhunter cause of there history he stood his ground even Jodie Foster stood her ground Ed Norton looked like a nervous wreck like he was going to hide in corner. Were introduced to \\"Freddy Lounds\\" only it's not as cool as Manhunter. & \\"Francis Dollarhyde\\" I'm sorry compared to Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde Ralph Finnes Dollarhyde is wuss. Noonan was more interesting they mentioned his messed up life but they didn't totally dwell on it. A lot of his actions througout the movie he's begging to be caught. Finnes \\"Dollarhdye\\" is just way too cliched hearing voices & all. Tom Noonan's Dollarhyde would have no problem kicking Finnes \\"Dollarhye's\\" a    z   z.  I mean there is a scene where he is at this newstand the guy tells him to come back later he purchases a paper anyway looks at the guy with a threating look. Lecter giving out the Graham's address is still there \\"Dollarhyde\\" takes \\"Lounds\\" has him in that wheel chair sets him on fire & goes down the same street where that newstand was at gee that guy at the newstand could put 2 & 2 together. The Brooklyn Musem scene was a giant WTF?! The finish is different cause \\"Dollarhyde\\" makes it look like he kills himself it turns out that it is the guy that he killed in Reba's yard. Basically the movie thinks it's smart & it is pretty predictable cause a lot of the lines & scnes are used from Manhunter. Basically \\"Dollarhyde\\" shows up at The \\"Graham house & we get a lame duck finish.  The Ending Dr Chilton tells Hannibal that there is a lady from The FBI & Lecter says \\"what's her name? LOL brillant not! I know it's closer to the book then it's a s hi t  t  y  book then. Ted Tally why didn't you just make a Hannibal sequel get Jodie Foster back or even William Peterson & end it on a good note. Brett Ratner wasn't a good choice to helm a Hannibal movie. I like Rush Hour 1&2 even X3 is better. Edward Norton is a good actor but he doesn't cut it for Will Graham. It's worth watching for Anthony Hopkins. Harvey Kitel was ok but he's done better like Bad Luitenant. Ralph Fiennes is I'mnot farmilar with but he didn't cut it for me. Phillip Semour Hoffman is just there. It's wathcable it's just not up to par with Manhunter. I mean if you like this movie that's fine but it's my opinion.

B00003CXSP|3.0|Hannibal 10 years after Silence Of The Lambs this had a lot of expectation lot of people hate this movie I'll admit I didn't care for it when I saw it the 1st time but I saw it again I have to say it was a decent sequel not a good sequel but I find it decent espically when compared to Red Dragon which I don't care for or even Hannibal Rising which is s hi t  t y. Directed by Ridley Scott he directed Alien Thelma & Louise Blade Runner GI Jane Black Hawk Down among many other films. Starring Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling Ray Liotta as Paul Krendler Giancarlo Giannini as Pazzi & Gary Oldman as Mason Verger. Story is about 10 years or so after Slience Clarice Starling is a veteran FBI agent you open up she & a team are going after some drug dealers they see the head girl of the gang she is carring a baby she calls the sting off but the Washington DC polic e jump the gun so to speak they get fired upon we get a big shoot out Clarice tells the head girl to surrender she shoots Clarice but she is wearing body armor of course she shoots & kills that head girl which lands her in hot water cause she was carring a baby. Meanwhile you got this cop in Florance Pazzi who is suspicous of this guy who he finds out that he is Hannibal Lecter. This 1 guy Mason Verger figures into the plot cause he has a bit of history with Hannibal cause he crippled him & had him mess his face up pretty good. So he'll use anybody to get back at Lecter. Clarice sees a survalance tape where she sees Lecter she tries to warn Pazzi in Florance not to go after him cause Pazzi is trying to catch him & get the reward money. While is trying to take Hannibal down Pazzi gets trapped he gets a brutal death. A cop is checking the area to see if Hannibal is ok of couse he did it & we get a good gore effect with the throat slicing. Clarice calls to try & warn Pazzi again but Hannibal is on the other end & we get \\"Hello Clarice.\\" Hannibal travels to the US stalks Paul Krendler & Clarice. There is a great scene in the mall where Lecter is playing mind games with Clarice but some guys working for Verger capture him Clarice trakcs them down but is hurt & it then results in Verger & his henchies being eaten by these hogs or whaterver. Hannibal takes Krendler & drugs him Clarice too we get a Hannibal style dinner with a great effect with the brain. The screen play had to be rewritten 15 times which I'm going to admit there are some problems. At this time it had the highest body count of any Hannibal movie. Christopher Reeve was offered the role of Verger but he dropped out of the project. After Jodie Foster & Jonathon Demme dropped out of the project Hopkins was reluctant to reprise his role. David Fincher was slated to direct but dropped out I can understand cause of bad luck with 3rd installments. Hopkins had no say in who would play Clarice. Reviews were mixed. Over 30 minutes of footage was cut some of it was put back in for the TV version. Ridley Scott did good enough cause he was directing a sequel to Silence Of The Lambs. Anthony Hopkins was great they were going for a slasher icon vibe but I was ok with that & I was fine with upping the gore. Julianne Moore was alright I'd rather had played a different character she looked sort of like Jodie Foster but she played too different from her. I mean they could've changed some of the plot points around made it a sequel to Silence & made her, her own character. So no where near as good as Manhunter or Silence but at best it's decent sequel & I'd say go for the 2 disc version.

B001EN71DG|4.0|While a cost-effective version of the original Trilogy is finally available, there is little to no digital remastering: while I'm happy to do without a musical interlude or a bird-beaked Sarlacc, it could have afforded some touch-up on light and coloring to restore its rich, vivd qualities for optimal viewing pleasure.<br /><br />That, and very little in the way of Special Features. Audio Commentary being a basic staple of DVD's, it doesn't include any behind-the-scenes docus, specifically for \\"Jedi\\", which is worth a viewing for any SW completionist.<br /><br />All-in-all, very pleased to have the originals on DVD, but definitely could've gone further for the die-hard fans.
0711986746|5.0|Peter Freestone was Freddie Mercury's personal assistant and friend for the last twelve years of Freddie's life.  Mr. Freestone's book is a great behind-the-scenes report of Mr. Mercury's life, loves, and friends.  After reading this book, I do feel I know the type of person Freddie Mercury was.  The author details the good and the bad--though there was not much bad about Freddie.  He was a generous (he bought lavish gifts for everyone in his life, including his maids), kind (he never fired anyone no matter how incompetent), and very humble man who valued his friends more than anything else in life.  The end of the book describes the last days of Freddie, and it is quite a tear-jerker.  However, Mr. Freestone manages to put Mercury's life into perspective.  He says Freddie would have hated getting old (I believe that) and he was surrounded by people who adored him till the end.  Though Mercury loved life and obviously wanted to live, it almost makes sense that he died so young.  Mercury was a brilliant musician and lived his life for the moment.  He packed a lot of life in 46 years, and went out as the diva that he was.  His exit from life was orchestrated and dramatic, just as I think Freddie would have wanted it:)
B0042RUMEQ|1.0|See, what I don't understand is why so many people had to buy this cd to realize it was GARBAGE.  You honestly couldn't tell from her singles and who her crew is (Lil' Wayne, Drake, and Young Money. . .really people, REALLY?)?  Her first single was entitled Massive Crap.  Her lyrics are sub-par at best and she has a stagnant, choppy rhyme style.  She's nowhere near the caliber of an emcee that Jean Grae or Tiye Phoenix (google them) is.  You want a real emcee, listen to them.  And for the record, I didn't buy the album, didn't even listen to it to have to know it's low rate pop garbage.
0061726826|5.0|Back when I read Before I Fall by Lauren Oliver, everyone was raving about it.  And while I liked it, I didn't think it was as great as everyone was claiming.  So when I read about Delirium, I didn't get my hopes up.  But boy was I surprised!  This book was way better than Before I Fall!        Right off the bat, I was engrossed in the story.  A world without love?  I can't even imagine having to live and not being able to feel things.  I really can't fathom it.  I am a very emotional person, so the idea of being \\"cured\\" of the \\"disease\\" is astonishing to me!  But the way the community was written made it feel so real.  Very scary! ( I loved the quotes that were at the beginning of each chapter--they were from \\"real\\" books talking about the disease.)     I quickly grew to love Lena.  She tried so hard to be good and follow the rules, yet she knew something was wrong and she followed her *gasp* heart.  And I loved Alex too!  What a sweet guy!       There are several surprises in this story.  I have to say that I personally didn't like the ending.  But that doesn't stop it from being an amazing story.  The ending is good and it fits, its just not what I thought was going to happen.        **SPOILER***                    I read about Alex getting shot and caught and all I could think was \\"NO, NO, NO\\" over and over again!                      It's been awhile since I have felt that strongly about a book and thought about it so much afterwards.  This was almost a 5 rating..so close (and I'll be giving it a 5 on Goodreads, Shelfari, and Amazon)!
0446195529|1.0|Normally I like Baldacci's books but this one was a disappointment.  I kept waiting for the book to get interesting but it never did.  Very slow going.  I gave up about 3/4's of the way through and skimmed the rest of the story.  I would not recommend this book.
B004HS1L9U|4.0|I personally have not seen the film yet,\\" the way back\\" but I have read the book that the film was modeled after, \\"The long walk\\", by Slavomir Rawicz. I am not a touchy feely kind of guy. But this book really got to me! Many times I had to fight back the tears, and the emotions this story brought out in me. I look at my freedom, 'here in America,\\" in a different light now. I hope I never take it for granted again. We read many books of the POW camps that the Germans had but little is said about the atrocities of the Russians, now you well get a small taste of it. This book is filled with the courage, tears, and the unconquerable human spirit.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|This is one of the best that HBO has ever done except that it ended too early ... I want more!  The writing is excellent, the acting superb and the historical accuracy is wonderful.  I know it sounds corny to say that it makes history come alive, but it does.  Some knowledge of the Roman Republic is helpful to really appreciating the work but it's not mandatory.
1433524619|5.0|Of the making of many study bibles there is no end as perhaps Solomon might have said today (Ecc. 12:12)! While there are many study Bibles that in my estimation would be better off having never been printed there are also some study bibles which are extremely useful to the Bible student. One such useful study bible is the ESV Study Bible which was released a couple years ago. The study bible was embraced by many as a faithful study tool which served a comprehensive guide to the Bible including such features as notes, introductions, essays on OT and NT theology and literature, maps, concordances, and illustrations.<br /><br />A complaint that is commonly raised by those who use the ESV Study Bible is the size and weight of the book. If any Bible qualified as a \\"tome\\" it is definitely the ESV Study Bible. The size and weight was of course understandable in view of the amount of content placed between its 2700+ pages. I have used the ESV Study Bible profitably in the past and continue to do so but the size and weight always made it somewhat unwieldy. I was therefore glad to see that Crossway was releasing a personal size edition which is significantly smaller and lighter than the regular edition.<br /><br />I decided to compare the two editions to see what the differences were.<br /><br />- The content of the two editions is exactly the same except that the articles found in the back of the book (i.e. \\"Bible Doctrine\\", \\"Biblical Ethics\\", \\"History of Salvation\\", and \\"The Bible and World Religions\\") have been removed in the personal size edition. While these articles are of good quality, they take up about 150 pages and thus add more bulk to an already large book. The personal size edition is without these articles making the book far more manageable.<br /><br />- I cannot verify the page thickness on both editions but they feel quite similar to my fingers and are both thick enough to not make bleed-through much of an issue.<br /><br />- The concordance has been somewhat reduced in the personal size but still includes enough words to be useful.<br /><br />- The wonderful articles contained throughout the Bible such as the introduction to the Pentateuch, Wisdom Literature, the Gospels, and NT theology among others have all been retained. This was a wise decision since these articles are quite pertinent to the study and interpretation of the Bible itself and are a significant element of the study tools found in the Bible. All the notes remain the same in both editions and have not been reduced at all. The amount of cross references also appear to remain the same.<br /><br />- The dimensions of the new edition make it a worthwhile purchase for ESV SB owners if they desire to carry the study Bible around. The dimensions of the personal size are almost exactly the same as my ESV Reference Bible (except for the thickness). It is also much lighter. You can comfortably hold the Bible in one hand.<br /><br />- The font size of the Bible text is 7.7 which is still quite comfortable. The study note size is 6.3 which is a bit more difficult but it is a fair trade off for the size of the book and the amount of content one receives. The amount of notes and study tools in such a small size is astounding.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this study Bible and especially the personal size as a great resource for studying the sacred Scriptures. The notes and other study helps (while imperfect) are quite helpful in the study of the Word. The study notes and helps should never become a replacement for one's own diligent and prayerful examination of the text but they should instead support this task. This study Bible is a good choice as a companion as one seeks to fulfill that task.<br /><br />Thank you to Crossway for providing me with a review copy!t reduced in the personal size but still includes enough words to be useful.<br /><br />- The wonderful articles contained throughout the Bible such as the introduction to the Pentateuch, Wisdom Literature, the Gospels, and NT theology among others have all been retained. This was a wise decision since these articles are quite pertinent to the study and interpretation of the Bible itself and are a significant element of the study tools found in the Bible. All the notes remain the same in both editions and have not been reduced at all. The amount of cross references also appear to remain the same.<br /><br />- The dimensions of the new edition make it a worthwhile purchase for ESV SB owners if they desire to carry the study Bible around. The dimensions of the personal size are almost exactly the same as my ESV Reference Bible (except for the thickness). It is also much lighter. You can comfortably hold the Bible in one hand.<br /><br />- The font size of the Bible text is 7.7 which is still quite comfortable. The study note size is 6.3 which is a bit more difficult but it is a fair trade off for the size of the book and the amount of content one receives. The amount of notes and study tools in such a small size is astounding.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this study Bible and especially the personal size as a great resource for studying the sacred Scriptures. The notes and other study helps (while imperfect) are quite helpful in the study of the Word. The study notes and helps should never become a replacement for one's own diligent and prayerful examination of the text but they should instead support this task. This study Bible is a good choice as a companion as one seeks to fulfill that task.<br /><br />Thank you to Crossway for providing me with a review copy!
B001GKJ2E8|4.0|\\"Wanted\\" neatly fits into the high octane, shoot `em up action subcategory that movies like \\"The Transporter\\" have filled over the years. Movies like these are certainly enjoyable for those who love fast cars and dangerous stunts, but in most cases someone who is looking for an action movie with more substance (like \\"The Dark Knight\\") should probably look elsewhere.     Google \\"Wesley Gibson\\" and no search results will appear. Or at least that's what the main character by the same name would have you believe. Wesley lives a rather mundane life working as an account service representative (or \\"account manager\\" as he often corrects himself) for an abrasive boss who causes him to have panic attacks. Every day is exactly the same for Wesley, as he skates through life feeling too apathetic to confront his cheating girlfriend or to stand up for himself at work.     Meanwhile, in one of the cooler action sequences of the movie, we witness a man literally leap across a city block, from inside one building to the rooftop of another, to fight off would-be assassins. Special effects are in full force in this scene: slow motion cameras capture him running full-speed down a hallway at an impossible speed, causing paper and office supplies to scatter in the process; small shards of glass break away as he bursts through a window shortly after; bullets fired mid-air literally curve around the columns of a building to hit a target.    Wesley is later approached by a woman named Fox who unconvincingly tells him that his estranged father, a member of an elite group of assassins called \\"The Fraternity,\\" was this man, who was later killed by a rogue agent. Following a fantastically choreographed shootout staged in a grocery store and a thrilling car chase, Wesley is introduced to Sloan, head of The Fraternity, and many of its members. After being provoked at gunpoint into performing the impossible task of shooting the wings off of several flies, Wesley is asked to join. While at first resistant, Wesley eventually relents and joins with the promise that he will have the opportunity to avenge his father's death.    James McAvoy, who stars as Wesley, gives a solid performance to a character that is meant to be quiet and unassuming, qualities that are certainly not consistent with your average highly trained agent. McAvoy gives an honest credibility to Wesley that other actors may not have been able to provide.    Acting aside, the movie looks great and is filled with plenty of subtle humor not normally contained in an action movie like this. While most of the action scenes are admittedly farfetched, as is the concept of a band of assassins that follows orders based on fate, the movie is still highly entertaining.    Filled with great action sequences and humor, and supplemented with a fresh take on an otherwise typical revenge story, \\"Wanted\\" is a unique and memorable movie. Going into the movie expecting to see an intelligent and realistic thriller will likely lead to disappointment; rather, by allowing yourself two hours of fun to absorb a reality where bullets can curve, \\"Wanted\\" then becomes a really cool movie.
0375826742|3.0|I would have to say that I give this book 3.5/5 stars. I have the same issues with this book as I did with the first two in the series. The book starts out really fast paced and ends in a flurry of action. The problem is that all of this action at the start and the finish comes at a price in the middle. The book is so slow through the middle that it is almost unbearable.    I appreciate good character and world development as much as any reader does, but there comes a point when you go too far with it. Paolini reaches that point and perhaps goes over it. I'm not an author, far from it in fact, but I feel like he could have accomplished the same effect he got with about 100-200 less pages. Don't get me wrong, it's a great story but it takes him too long to tell it.    I will get off of my soapbox now. He does a great job of storytelling at the end and completely makes up for the dragging through the middle. So, I will get the 4th book when it comes out. As far as I know he hasn't set a release date yet for the last book. I hope it's not too far off because I don't want to have to read through all of these books again to remember what happened and why. I guess we'll just have to see how it goes.    Rating: 3.5/5
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I bought this bag for my Canon HF S200 and all the accessories I carry with it. I needed to fit the camera, a Zoom H4 Handy Recorder, an Audio-Technica shotgun microphone, my external hard drive, a pair of over-ear headphones, and various cables, filters, etc.<br /><br />It all fits perfectly! There's just room to spare for a couple more things.<br /><br />The only things I have problems with are that the tripod loops are on the side, which overbalances the backpack when you carry a tripod. They'd be better on the bottom. Also, the front pocket doesn't open far enough to really see what's inside and rummage around. It would be nice if the pocket would open all the way, like the main backpack interior.<br /><br />But those are minor, minor caveats. This is a great bag!
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Great movies, especially Tremors!  The others are a lot of fun too though.  AssBlasters lol, gotta love it.  I got lucky and found the attack pack at walmart for $13.99.    I didnt realize people were looking for a collectable set or anything like that, but judging by some of the reviews, they are.  This isn't that type of set.  But if you want to have all 4 movies, this is the way to go.
1594202842|4.0|I think Amy is right about alot of things...and I am one of those Western indulgent parents.  My son and I have had fights about KUMON, homework, swimming and guitar...I have said some nasty things...I wish, on some level, I was more like Amy...I don't know where she gets the energy!  She is definitely the Tiger Mother.  I enjoyed the book; laughed and cried out loud.  Thank you for sharing your story, Amy.
0553801503|1.0|This series was wonderful starting out and i was hooked on book one.  The books have been getting weaker and weaker with this latest installment making me feel as if i have wasted my time.  Too many characters in and out of the story without little development for the reader and after thousands of pages without proper reintroduction to the reader.  Disjointed and weak effort on this book that started weak already in book 3.  I have formally given up on this series after such great promise in the first two books.
B00004YA66|5.0|The acting & directing could have stepped it up a notch but I'm still giving it 5 stars because it is one of the most creative screenplays I've ever seen without forcing the audience to suspend their disbelief too much.  Twisted plot which is very entertaining.  Highly recommend.

0670022411|4.0|I waited for this book to launch after reading review after review before it was published.  I was not disappointed and feel bad that the author is being negatively reviewed because people don't understand where to complain.  The characters were fun to read.  Once in awhile the main characters were a little over the top with their conviction and determination to be brave.  The characters at times veered toward the cliche side of the road with being strong willed.  At times the plot had silly mistakes that put them in danger...outside to get an apple...really?  That being said, this was a good escape and I am eagerly waiting for the second book.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|When You Reach Me i not just the average time travel story that every kid reads. It talks about the social issues that kids go through everyday in fear of not fitting in. It is a perfect balence of relistic fiction ans mystery, because its show the main charecter Mirandas every day life, along with her trying to understand the notes she keeps getting.    When You Reach Me is my favorite bookand will be for a really long time.
B000W91RUG|5.0|When this show first aired, I did not want to watch it. The first few of episodes were dry and not at all funny. My husband was really intrigued, so I continued to watch it and I am so glad that I did. This has quickly become my favorite television show and I am not one to watch sitcoms. This show is laugh out loud hilarious and the best way to use 30 minutes of your day. You don't even have to be a scientist to enjoy it. Each character has an interesting personality that brings something to the show and of course there is Sheldon. Whoever has not seen Jim Parson's play this role is truly missing out. There is a reason Sheldon wins awards!  I am not the type to purchase seasons of TV on DVD and I already own all available seasons of Big Bang. On Christmas day, when we opened Big Bang we began watching and didn't stop till we finished the first two seasons...it is that addicting!
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|Perfect for Twilight fans... But one disc for dvd and blue ray was a surprise; even though definitely more ecologically correct, limits simultaneous usage...
B003V1WUKS|2.0|Ok this is a hard review to write as I am a huge fan of James Franco and I wanted this book very badly for Christmas so when it was purchased for me, I had no idea what it was about...I didn't even read the back. So at first, I was stunned that it was short stories...so if you are like me and do not read the synopsis of books, don't be surprised when you see short stories that do not connect to one another. I know a lot of the reviews are very poor about this book but I can't say I was horribly disappointed. I was shocked and not at all ready for what I was reading but I thought it was well written if what I got out of it was his reasoning. This book is very much stream of consciousness, and very in the moment. A word of warning: be ready for the words, thoughts and actions of the characters as they can be very disturbing. Once I was over the initial shock of it, it was easier to digest. While I would hope that people out there are not like the characters in the book, I am not naïve and I realize that there are people like this...even kids. Therefore, the best way I can explain it is that this book is very real and occasionally that might make you cringe. This book will not leaving you feeling good about the world in general and even might leave a sickness in your mouth. If you are interested in reading it, just remember this and you might be able to get through it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend this book, so I provide this review in hopes that you are prepared to read if you choose to do so.  Would I purchase again? Probably not to be honest as it didn't leave me feeling good and that is not what I want from a story, especially fiction. The real world can be hard enough as is; I don't need to live it in fiction as well.
0765326353|5.0|This is the best epic fantasy I have read since [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]] - I have to admit to being burnt by doorstopper fantasy series over the years that start well and that steadily decline in quality, and I know other readers who avoid these big fantasy series now as a result.  For me, despite greatly enjoying Sanderson's previous books, starting a series like this, after I had found it is going to be 10 books long is taking a real chance that this author is up to the task of actually writing a quality series of that many books. Not many authors are capable of doing this, but given Sanderson's writing speed and quality so far I'm going to take chance.    Having said all that - I am, however, impressed by this first book and will be recommending it to friends.  Kaladin, sold into slavery by a betrayal and Dalinar the warlord whose eyes have been opened to ethics and honour and Shallan a thief and a liar apprenticed to a renowned scholar are the main characters in this book.  Kaladin is probably the most compelling character in this instalment with a strong runner up with Dalinar.  I won't go over the plot points in detail as other reviewers have already done so, but for lovers of fantasy I highly recommend this start to what looks like it could be a classic fantasy series and I'm eagerly awaiting book two in Stormlight Archive series.
B002ZG983M|1.0|Nicolas Cage your should be ashamed of yourself! He should never have ever thought about being in this dreadful movie.  The script should have told the entire story.  If this isn't the very worst movie ever released than it must be a close second.    Avoid this one like the Plague!!!!!
0307266303|5.0|I loved this book, so much so that I've read it twice already. As a keen runner the whole book is interesting from front to back covers.  I would recommend this as a great read to anyone, runner or not.    Reading about the culmination of Caballo Blanco's dream race was exciting and inspiring. It made my legs twitch just imagining being able to run through the Copper Canyons.    The implication that the more advanced the running show the more injuries a runner suffers makes perfect sense. Having tried to adapt my running to more along the lines recommended in the book I've found it easier to run faster without actually noticing or feeling any additional stress on the body or lungs.     I can feel a third read coming on...
B000JIHP88|3.0|First the good:<br /><br />It seems to soothe my baby and help him sleep, or entertain him enough that he won't fuss before falling asleep.<br /><br />Very colorful (though you can't see that at night) it does have a light up part that I like<br /><br />I like that it has the ability to be sound only or motion and sound, and that it has two sound settings, louder and quiet.  We exclusively use the quiet though.<br /><br />Has an automatic turn off feature so batteries are not wasted.<br /><br />I like the remote, I don't have to go over and risk disturbing baby to reset the music when it turns off.<br /><br />3 song style choices or rain-forest sounds<br /><br />Now the bad:<br /><br />My mobile is supposed to have the turn-y bottom part with the animals and the three leaves are supposed to fluctuate up and down.  Only one of my leaves move the others get \\"stuck\\" in the up position.<br /><br />I wish there were more options for length that the music stays on.  Sometimes the time is not enough.<br /><br />The clicker remote button is actually kind of loud.<br /><br />UPDATE:  now the motorized rotating part of the unit does not function at all.  So I'd probably have to lower my original rating to 1 star now.
1906694176|5.0|This book goes full circle with the others.  The Trilogy was great reading.  It's sad that there aren't more. Be prepared for disturbing images though.
B00122HTT0|5.0|This is an incredible landmark from my college days, when I played it unceasingly on my stereo and in my head during study breaks and philosphical walks on the beach or in the woods. The semi-depressed yet edgy and sometimes rebellious songs are Young classics for me from that period of my life. The power of music! One of my all-time favorite lines from many Neil Young favorites is on this album:  \\"Though my problems are meangingless, that don't make then go away...\\"  I use that one all the time.  Thanks, Neil!
B002BU0DPE|4.0|Not having ever owned a headset for a PS3 or other gaming system I was out of my realm (I own a Razr for my PC) and unsure based on all of the mixed reviews of headsets that I kept running into.  This headset has turned out to be perfect for my needs.     As a woman even buying a headset for my PC was a bit of a trial, though they are adjustable many will fall off of your head when they are cranked all the way to the tightest setting.  Most headsets will also be so large (ear cups) that it is aggravating trying to keep them centered with good sound quality, or their weight - being so large - hurts your head after about an  hour of gaming.      Luckily this Turtle Beach headset didn't have either of these problems, you can crank it small enough to fit around a woman's head and the ear cups are comfortably padded.  You won't have a huge weight dragging you down and they don't press so tightly that they begin to get uncomfortable.  Obviously after several hours you are going to feel a little pressure, but that just goes with the territory.      I did not notice any serious hissing or feedback from the headset, and it was very easy to hook into the television.  The fact that I could couple it with my HD cables was a huge plus, and setup only took a few minutes, I spent most of my time configuring settings on the PS3.  The clip that keeps the controls in place is sturdy and not prone to breaking though I haven't had much use for it, I find it easier to simply reach down and flick the mute or other volume options myself.      The chat boost can be annoying as much as it is helpful, though that is more a problem of other people practically shoving their own mic into their mouth and screaming through the speakers than the headset itself.  I like the function, especially since I like to keep the game volume down minus ambient noises and hear my team/party members clearly.  The adjustable mouthpiece is easy to adjust but sturdy enough to stay in place without drooping and having to be repositioned.      As for the quality of the headset let me start off by saying I am not terribly gentle with my electronics.  I have had this headset for over a month and rage-quit once in that time and it still works just as well as the day I got it out of the box.  I also have a tendency to leave my headset on the floor around cats, and their affectionate nibbling on the wires has produced no problems.  I've had the wire tripped on, dropped the headset onto the floor, and tossed it across the room (ala rage-quitting) and it hasn't shown any wear or tear, nor has the sound quality suffered in the slightest.    I am sure that if I were to compare this product to others in the higher price rage ($150+) it wouldn't come out on top, but for the price and function it's well worth it.  I really can't see any specific function it is lacking (aside from surround sound simulation but that's just greedy of me to expect on something of this price, or wireless which means I'd be buying a different headset entirely), or any defect in the craftsmanship.  While I am sure that given enough abuse the wires connecting the headset to the PS3 may wear or pull causing a problem but thus far it has stood up very well and I expect that it will continue to do so well into the future barring something catastrophic.      This headset is well worth the cost and functions surprisingly well for the cost.  If I had to get another headset for the future I would pick something wireless for the sheer convenience factor, but I'd probably be spending a lot more money than what this Turtle Beach is priced at.
B0026OE2O8|4.0|As others have said more capably than I ever could, the images in HOME are breathtaking. My wife and I are fans of nature programs, enjoying Nature for decades on PBS, and National Geographic, and David Attenborough. We now have many of their programs on DVD. Yet HOME showed us scenes of Earth we'd never seen before, moving us deeply.<br /><br />We were unhappy with the narration. Can't put my finger on what bothered us, just that it did. Maybe the earnestness, maybe the muffled monotone. (My player feeds audio to an above-average sound system, so that's not the problem.) Am going to wait before buying a copy of HOME in hope a reissue will provide another narrator. I know, fat chance.<br /><br />The music was mostly excellent, especially when it sounded like Philip Glass. Not so good was the lamenting female voice, just caterwauling to our ears.<br /><br />In the film's closing minutes, the screen goes to black with words providing dire statistics and urging action. I wish they had been omitted altogether -- hadn't the point already been made? aren't we already among the convinced? -- but if it was felt exhortatory slides were needed, then much better to have presented graphs or charts, giving us numbers with cold, convincing facts.<br /><br />Still, the above are just quibbles I'm a little ashamed to even bring up. HOME is a monumental record of our world in the 21st century. Much of the film astonishes the eye, making us ask for more information (Dubai, the skyscrapers of China's new cities, the camel caravan, the agricultural revolution).<br /><br />It's a film your teenager needs to see before flying the nest.
0064407667|5.0|Lemony Snicket's book, \\"The Bad Beginning,\\" is the story about the Baudelaire orphans (Klaus, 14 year old Violet, and baby Sunny) who are forced to live with a distant cousin, Count Olaf, a struggling actor, in his terrible home environment.     The author does a very good job in moving the story quickly along to allow the suspense to begin. Count Olaf is a terrible man, the children learn but he's a relative. He has a vicious, evil plan to inherit the Baudelaire fortune.    Without giving it away, the good and bad people are easy to learn in this story. The characters are colorful like Count Olaf, Judge Strauss, and Mr. Poe. The kids are also well-written to help move the story along.    The book only took me less than an hour to read at the most. It's an easy fun read even for adults.
B002RBZ13Q|3.0|The sound of this blu ray seems a bit dull or lacking in crispness on the high frequency.

0307346617|3.0|The First time I read this book, I thought it was amazing.  However, the second time I read through it, I noticed things I didn't before.  Like, how this book seems to be based more of the author's opinions, assumptions, and personal politics, rather than real thorough research. I know it sounds oxymoronic to say 'that's not what would REALLY happen in a ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE'.  But still...    My first beef with this book are some of it's portrayals.  Some of his descriptions of countries and the people from them seem to be based more on stereotypes than real research.  Case and point, he largely portrays Russians as regressive, neolithic subhumans, with a pathological inclination towards suicide.  After the war, he has Russia become some kind of fanatical religious empire.  Who turn their 'apparently few' surviving women into broodmares and sex slaves. The Ukrainians use nerve gas on their own people, 'just like the damn, dirty commies they are!'  Please... I think Ronald Reagan could have depicted them better.  Also, his descriptions of China seem to be a bit on the stereotypical side too.  An archaic, backwards, oppressive government, with fake space stations, AND the plague originates there?  Come on.  Oh, Iran and Pakistan also destroy each other with nuclear bombs.  This sounds more like a wet dream from the Bush era, or something.    Though I like in the beginning of the book how America's current system was highly destructive to it's early survival.  With it's unchecked, runaway capitalism. It's corrupt, incompetent government.  And, it's amoral business practices, which makes a killing off of stupid, short sighted people who die in droves because of their blind, unwavering trust in the system.  This I could honestly see happening.      The one thing I didn't like is the way that the US conveniently gets the perfect leader at the perfect time, who makes all the right decisions, early in the war.  While every other country on Earth seems to be suffering from terribly incompetent leadership, who sometimes appear to be nothing more than sociopathic, genocidal, morons. It's not that I didn't like that the US pulled through the war.  I just don't like it how they were able to get through it relatively scot-free rather than painfully collapsing and reforming, like so many other countries do in this book.  Oh, and Israel is the only country smart enough to prepare for the zombie menace and are generous enough to invite Palestinians back for safety...  I almost laughed at this part, 'welcomed with open arms' my ass.      *sigh*  In the end, I have to admit that this book, despite all it's faults, is still pretty good.  The general concept for it is old, the zombie apocalypse thing.  But how he tackled it was rather unique and very engaging to read.

B003UESJH4|5.0|The Prince Albert, Duke of York (Colin Firth), known as Bertie to his family, finds himself repeatedly made to address the nation with radio broadcasts becoming something of great importance. Since Bertie suffers from a rather severe stammer, this is problematic. With his father King George V (Michael Gambon) nearing death and his brother David (Guy Pearce) considering abandoning the throne in favor of marrying a twice-divorced woman, Bertie is under immense pressure to please the monarchy. Having tried several techniques and doctors to no avail, Bertie's wife Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) consults the unorthodox Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), a failed Australian actor who believes he can cure Bertie of his stammer. While initially skeptical of Lionel, Bertie eventually comes around with the realization that Lionel may be the only person who can help him with this problem. Their dynamic friendship forms the backbone of the entire film.     The King's Speech is one of the most acclaimed films of 2010 and has stolen the thunder once held by The Social Network, making it the favorite to win the Best Picture Academy Award. The film makes an interesting companion piece to The Social Network in that both films deal with new ways to reach people and the effect that those advances have on personal relationships. In some ways, the friendship between Bertie and Lionel is the perfect flipside for the friendship between Jesse Eisenberg and Andrew Garfield. While The Social Network more closely reflects personal relationships of today and is a closer representation of the attitude of today's society it's obvious why the Academy would favor a film like The King's Speech, which is an inspiring, crowd-pleasing film with a positive portrayal of friendship at the heart of it...And is a hard film not to like.    This is very much a character-driven piece that is only as good as it's actors. Firth is a lock for Best Actor and is in rare form giving a convincing and charming performance that presents the daunting task of holding your interest and gaining your empathy while playing a character with a stammer. It takes a talented actor to not only make the stammer convincing, but not annoy the audience with it and still create a triumphant and fascinating character. Firth does all of this and will be a very deserving recipient of his award. When it comes to the Best Supporting Actor race; my heart wants John Hawkes, while my head says Christian Bale but I believe Rush has some serious stake in this race. Arguably, Rush gives the most likable performance of the five nominees and his character of Lionel Logue was probably not an Oscar-worthy role on the page. I'm sure that it is Rush's charming and likable performance that scored the nomination and not the pre-written role. The other nominee is Bonham Carter as Bertie's assertive, supportive wife. Bonham Carter is effective and she's a favorite to some, but I'd give the edge to Melissa Leo this year. All the bit roles are well-played and even Guy Pearce is good in his small role, although his casting is a mystery. Pearce is seven years younger than Firth and is noticeably younger, but is cast as Firth's older brother. It really is the dynamic and great screen chemistry between Firth and Rush that elevate this film however. The two play off each other terrifically, delivering some of the wittiest lines, all while displaying remarkable comedic timing even while one actor must do so with a stammer. I'd like to see these two work together again and while Firth will definitely be seen accepting his gold statute, I will be pleased to see Rush up there as well.    Unlike most historical films, cinematographer Danny Cohen hasn't shot a sprawling epic that allows the audience to take in every historical re-creation. The King's Speech differs significantly from this historical film template by shooting the majority of the film inside with tight shots that create the illusion of everything towering over or closing in on Bertie. The cinematography here is absolutely elegant, while the score by Alexandre Desplat is a sweeping, Oscar-baiting score that serves to heighten and intensify the film's most dramatic scenes and does so admirably.     The man overcoming personal obstacles to achieve greatness is such a familiar storytelling cliché, but one that frequently succeeds at connecting with an audience. Yes, The King's Speech is based on a true story but that doesn't mean it's wholly original. It's a crowd-pleasing, historical film that is funny, charming, and accessible with themes that everyone can relate to and it happens to be very well-made and well-told.  Frankly The King's Speech is predictable, Oscar-baiting fare and a first-rate crowd-pleaser. However familiar its story may be, I can't find a cinematic misstep though. It really is very well-made. Don't let my complaints about Hollywood politics overrating this film dissuade you from thinking it's not a great film. For all the familiarity, it is a great film but it's not a film that will be discussed years from now. I have found it difficult to resist the film's charm however and I admit that there are actors here doing career-best work and it's an uplifting film that's guaranteed to put a smile on your face.    The film is inexplicably rated `R' for `some language,' which actually means `a scene of sustained strong language.' In the film, Lionel discovers that Bertie doesn't stammer when he swears and he incorporates this into the sessions. The MPAA has a policy that the `f' word can only be used up to three times in a non-sexual context to get a PG-13 rating. The fact that it's used in a non-sexual, historical context and is a film that may actually be accessible to a younger audience who can't see `R' rated films seems to not influence their decisions. This is a very unfortunate rating and is yet another reason why the MPAA needs to be reformed.    GRADE: A-
0545123275|3.0|This book takes a lot of patience to get through. The story is a very slow one and its very mellow, but its also a very nice story. I enjoyed the book very much, just wish there was a little more thrill to it than there was.

B000ETQR3Q|4.0|Definitely one of the most durable and best mechanical system of all the nerf gun's when it come's to range and power - especially if you mod for a hobby.  Although I'm a bit miffed at the price - considering that I saw prices as low as 35 dollars at some store (then again, you don't know how may distributors those products went through).    Overall, this was definitely the best nerf gun I've purchased in comparison to the newer models.    What I liked:  -Range  -Power  -Bolt action (easier to lock compared to other nerf guns - without modding them)  -Weight: feels a bit more realistic    Disliked:  -Accuracy once you add the extension  -The adjustable stock (can only adjust to 2 settings)  -the grip when you put down the legs for the tripod  -the durability of the streamlined darts - they wear out pretty fast
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I found this book on a recommendation from the Lovely Bones.  I'm sure glad I did.  Read it in 2 sittings.  Each chapter changes from the present time to the past.  It's about Emily and Chris growing up together, love, and Emily's death.  It starts out with the parents meeting for their weekly dinner and then receiving the call from the hospital about their kids.  It then turns into Chris on trail for murder.  Slowly Emily's depression begins to surface and it becomes clear Chris wasn't feeling the same way.  This book will grab your heartstrings and pull them and pull them.  I had tears on a few occasions.  I couldn't tear my eyes away and I was thrilled with the ending, it was worth the wait.  The truth of this book is, Emily was selfish.  If she loved Chris as much as he thought she'd never have done this to him.

0670022411|5.0|I won't get into the plot of this story as others have already covered it.  I just wanted to say, I loved this book.  The intelligent writing, historical detail alongside the modern (Oxford, Bodleian, etc.), and the cast of characters...wow.  My only complaint: how long I will have to wait for the second book in this trilogy.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I just finished level one for the first time 30 minutes ago and the sweat is still pouring off me. Hardest workout I've ever done but knowing that it was only 20 minutes kept me going until the end. Jillian explains all the movements in detail and even at level one there is a beginner and an advanced level. Even though you aren't doing cardio the entire 20 minutes your heartrate gets up quickly and stays up. What a great work out. I'll be back tomorrow for more.
076532413X|3.0|The idea of the story was very interesting, and fresh. The writing is so-so. Nothing great or bad. Towards the end of the book I was speed reading more then enjoying page by page as the story was losing its appeal.     The book is a short read, entertaining for the first half, but hard to finish the last half. It loses its momentum towards the end and gets bummed down by mediocre writing.
0061537969|5.0|This book is the first I read about a dog, having never had a pet. I loved it and also the racing parts as I live behind Dover Downs in Dover. It was unique in that it came from the mind of Enzo the dog. I read some aloud to family and friends and everyone enjoyed it, funny and sad. This book has everything and I'm going to read this author again. I like the way he writes.
0525951652|4.0|Overall I enjoyed Ken Follett's \\"Fall of Giants\\" and look forward to the second installment in his century trilogy.  Most of the fictional characters in the book (Earl Fitzherbert, Lady Maud, Ethel and Billy Williams, Grigori and Lev Peshkov, Gus Dewar, and so on) are believable in the sense they could have actually existed in real life and, if they did exist, would probably behave the way they do in the novel. The weak link in my opinion is  probably the German/Austrian Von Ulrich family, especially the young Walter, who is not that credible  from a historical perspective.     Generally speaking, for narrative purposes, fictional characters in the book are frequently involved in actual historical events interacting with real-life historical characters like Lloyd George, Winston Churchill, Woodrow Wilson, Vladimir Lenin and others. Barring that, which is inevitable in any work of fiction, Follett is reasonably faithful to historical fact and gives readers a pretty accurate description of European and, to a lesser extent, American society and politics in the 1911-1923 period, going through the traumatic events of World War I, the Russian Revolution and the early days of the Weimar Republic. Having said that, Follett's obsession to depict the European landed aristocracy as the \\"villains\\"  behind the war and, conversely, to glorify the working masses as both the innocent victims of that villainy and the heroes of the post-war brave new world is somewhat contrived.     The role of the aristocracy in the events that unfold in the book is particularly exaggerated in the case of the United Kingdom. Yes, Britain was a monarchy in 1914 (as it still is today !) and did have its own share of  hereditary dukes, earls, viscounts and barons, whose descendants are still around by the way and who, like Earl Fitzherbert in the book,  were wealthy landowners. By 1911 however, political power had been already transferred from the aristocracy to the upper middle-class as the House of Lords was effectively stripped of its power to veto legislation passed by the popularly elected House of Commons. Starting in the early 20th century, all British prime ministers and most of the key cabinet ministers who ran the daily affairs of the empire (e.g. finance, foreign relations, defense, etc.) were drawn from the Commons and did not hold peerages while in office. Likewise, senior civil servants (i.e professional government bureaucrats) and most military officers/commanders were also recruited from the middle classes, and not from the landed nobility.     That is not to say that Britain was a fully-fledged democracy by 1914. As mentioned in the book, parliamentary suffrage was somewhat narrow: Follett claims that only roughly 50 % of the adult males had the right to vote before WWI, although 60 % is probably a more accurate figure. In any case, a significant section of the working class and, most importantly, all women were excluded from the political process. One of the major topics in the book is precisely how the war led to the introduction of universal adult male suffrage and limited voting rights  (conditioned on certain age and property requirements) for women (women wouldn't get equal voting rights as men in Britain until 1928 !).      Although his interpretation may be over-simplistic, Follett makes a deliberate effort in the book to contrast the post-war fates of Britain on one hand, and  Russia/Germany on the other. Britain, victorious in the war, but economically crippled and facing domestic social unrest, did not descend into revolutionary chaos precisely because, as Follett argues, the political aspirations of the working classes and the trade union movement were ultimately accommodated by the parliamentary system with the rise of the Labour (U.S. spelling 'Labor') party. That eventually allowed a \\"socialist\\" government to co-exist even with the King and the hereditary peers, not to mention the ruling capitalist class. Follett, having been himself married to a former Labour member of Parliament, seems very comfortable describing the rise of the British Labour party to power in the general election of 1923, where both of his working-class sibling characters, Billy and Ethel, are elected to the House of Commons (a truly socialist Labour government wouldn't take over in the UK though until the general election of 1945 !).       By contrast, in the continent, as the autocracy of the Tsar and the Kaiser were swept away by the war, the lack of properly functioning democratic institutions that could accommodate social tension contributed to the early rise of communism in Russia in the 1917-21 period and, later, to the Nazis seizing power in Germany in the 1930's. Follett will no doubt elaborate more on this as his second book in the trilogy guides us through the 1930s, World War II and the horrors of Nazism and Stalinism.     Follett's depiction of America, the rising global power in the early 20th century that was destined to replace the old European empires as the world's most influential country, is also curious. Compared to his own sober and overtly negative description of the European societies,  Follett paints a mostly positive and upbeat picture of the United States. Given the author's own aforementioned anti-aristocracy bias,  it is unsurprising that he would see the United States, a federal republic without a landed nobility, as a comparatively more democratic and egalitarian society. That was BTW the predominant view  probably shared at the time by most European immigrants,  especially those from socially backward countries like Follett's own Lev Peshkov,  who were attracted to the United States not only because of its idea of freedom, but also, more significantly, because of its promise of material wealth and economic prosperity.     Follett, however, also strives to make the point that America's \\"equality\\" and \\"freedom\\" only went so far. Not only was there a social class divide in the United States (as seen in Follett's Buffalo and as expected in any capitalist society), but also, more significantly, as the book stresses, \\"equality\\" did not extend to African-Americans (\\"negroes\\"), who, at the time, were legally segregated and, in many states, effectively barred from voting due to the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other similar mechanisms. Even U.S. president Woodrow Wilson, the idealist intellectual who came up with the 14 points for peace, is paradoxically described by Follett as an overt racist who introduced segregation in the federal government and suppressed free speech during the war with the Espionage Act. The social problems of America, including the early rise of gangsterism and organized crime following the introduction of alcohol prohibition, are also vividly and competently described in \\"Fall of Giants\\".     Just to conclude, perhaps the book's biggest shortcoming in my humble opinion is that we do not get to see the French point of view, as there is no major French character in the novel. Given that France was the biggest contributor to the allied forces in the western front (fought mostly on French soil) and probably had the most casualties in WWI after Germany and Russia, that omission is regrettable. In any case, like most English speakers, Follett probably sees the French as \\"irrelevant\\", so we, non-anglophone readers, have to live with that !    PS: Other Brazilians who might be reading this review may be interested to know that \\"Fall of Giants\\" has been translated to Portuguese under the title \\"Queda de Gigantes\\". Surprisingly, the original book in English is actually cheaper than the translated paperback version in Portuguese.
0792838912|5.0|Excellent film...it had been several years since my initial viewing, now I'm glad to have added it to my DVD collection of fine film works (and soundtrack to boot)!
0385341679|2.0|I guess it's my fault that I expected some GREAT ending to this series.  But honestly, how could the author possibly live up to the hype and expectation of ALL us readers after 4 previous books?  I'll tell you how, by answering the big questions and having the main characters grow and evolve and not regress.  Unfortunately, that's not what happened here.  It's almost impossible to write a review for this book without including spoilers...because to show why I feel the way I do about this book, I would have to include spoilers to do it!!!<br /><br />Here goes.  For the last four books, we've watched Mac 1.0 evolve into Mac 5.0.  However, there were several instances in this book where her decision making was Mac 1.0 all the way.  I mean, why would you think something heavily warded and chained would not be dangerous!!!  Also, after being willing to remake the world and \\"sleep with the enemy\\" for Barrons, how quickly she went back to playing that Mac 1.0 game....\\"I love you but I'm scared to tell you or show you!!!\\"  For four books, we've watched Mac try to take on the Lord Master and then here...WHAM!!<br /><br />NOTHING!!!!  Can you say \\"ANTICLIMACTIC\\" !!!<br /><br />There were a few things I liked about this book.  I liked the idea that not everything or EVERYONE were who they appeared to be.  I liked that Barrons and Mac sort-of, kinda, finally expressed how they felt for each other.  But the bad outweighs the good.  So much of the previous books seemed irrelevant based on this final book.  And just like always, some questions were left unanswered.  What's to become of Christian, Dani, Ryoden, and the others?  And who is Dancer???  Well I'm done!  If answers to these question are in other upcoming books, I'll just have to get them from some other readers spoilers.  I've given all the time I am going to give to this series.  I feel like the sheep Dani accused the sidhe-seer of being.  LOL.
0684833395|3.0|I bought this to re-read for my Book Club. I had read it many years ago and had loved it. Now, a couple of decades +, it just didn't hit the same level. I guess it's true that life changes your perspective on the past.
0307272702|5.0|The title of this review is  \\"one of the most interesting books I've ever read\\" and I've read a bunch.  Hundreds.  And some of them have been about diets.    Anyways, I used to think when I was a kid \\"there must be some sort of pill we could take that would just tell our body to do something else with the calories\\".  You know, besides turning them into fat.      Well, that pill does exist, for the some of us that have so much trouble with weight control - avoid carbohydrates as much as possible.      There are two things I've grown accustomed to eating too much of over the years - saltines and ice cream, chips and bread.  Lately, add beer to the list.  I remember when I was young  - maybe sixteen - I'd get in this horrible moods.  One day, I went into the breakroom at work and had a doughnut.  Instantly, I felt like a million dollars.  Clearly, I have some sort of blood sugar issues.    Regardless, I haven't read `Good calories` but I find it crazy that it's more dense than this book, which also tends to be a tough read at parts.      Thanks Gary.
0307346617|3.0|I did not enjoy the way this book is written.  Is is many mini encounters/accounts of what happened during World War Z.  Just you are getting into a character and what is happening after 2-5 pages... Bam! It is over and you don't go back.    Writting is good, but a big part of what makes a Zomibe book good is a connection to character, which you can't have in this book.
0545128285|4.0|Always thought that Rowling was a genius.. And these books add even more colour and definition to the world of witchcraft and wizardry in harry potter.
0312600844|2.0|Somewhere in here is a great novel trying to get out. Unfortunately the good - and even great - parts are smothered. I was so disappointed because at times I felt \\"this is great\\", suddenly to have my hopes crushed a few lines later by clumsy irrelevance. Where is the editing? Was this a first draft that was allowed to escape?   The premise is fine - a story of a dysfunctional family through the decades, up to the present day. But it's hard to keep your interest going throughout the novel simply because none of the characters are appealing, none of them are engaging and none of them make you want to champion them. As other reviewers have noted, Patty's \\"autobiography\\" sections are written in the same voice as the narrator, so these become merely a contrivance for her character to put \\"her thoughts\\" (actually the narrator's) into her husband's hands.  I read this having just finished John Irving's latest novel, \\"Last Night in Twisted River\\" and it struck me what a gulf in quality there is between both these authors, even though they use similar stylistic devices.
B0041KKYCY|3.0|Save your money a pale comparison to the original.  Lighting is poor throughout, acting almost as bad, none of the suspense or karmic retribution that you would expect.  As with most remakes leaves a lot to be desired, buy the original if you have yet to see it, much better investment.
0670022411|5.0|The book, should appeal to those who love Twilight but were hoping for a more adult version instead of teenage angst.  This book will pull you in with its writer's quick wit and emotional self awareness.  I read it in 3 days.

B003U0AHBO|2.0|This movie should have worked.  The story of Robin Hood has been effectively retold in countless films.  I expected a raw, more historically accurate portrayal than I'd seen in previous efforts.<br /><br />The film presented 2 great actors at the top of their games: Crowe, Blanchette. The action came heavy and often.  The scenery was beautiful.<br /><br />How could they mess this up?... Well, they did... It just didn't click.<br /><br />I'm reluctant to criticize the length of a film.  I've watched many 3-hour movies and wished they were longer.  But, this film stretched a 90 minute story into 150 minutes.  It REALLY dragged.<br /><br />There was zero chemistry between Robin and Marion.  Both actors seemed far more interested in posing than they did in each other.<br /><br />Bit characters play a significant role in story.  I don't enjoy films that portray one-dimensional parts around the main stars.  Other than Robin and Marion, every character was a cardboard cutout.<br /><br />Compared to great period-pieces like 'Braveheart' (I could have watched full films on the bit players) I felt no connection to anyone in this movie.<br /><br />Perhaps a fast forward button will make this film more bearable, but I doubt it.

B00006AW2J|2.0|Many people believe this album started the Stone's \\"greatest winning streak in rock\\", ie, the albums Let It Bleed, Sticky Fingers, and Exile On Main St. I think the following three albums are great, but without a doubt I would say this is definitely the far inferior one of the bunch; in fact, it comes nowhere close to the three following albums.    I will of course agree there are gems here. But what one notices when one first sees the tracks on Beggar's Banquet is excitement. You have never seen most of theses tracks before; THAT IS FOR A REASON.    \\"Sympathy\\" is of course a Stone's classic, which I think deserved Single status. But the most of the album is awful.     The only tracks worth bothering with are Stray Cat and Sympathy.    The main problem with the other tracks is they are built around central, very repetitive, crappy riffs.    Dear Doctor, Parachute Woman, Jigsaw Puzzle, Street Fighting Man, No Expectations, Factory Girl and Salt are absolutely bloody awful.  They are so annoyingly repetitive that you may want to simply change albums. Parachute, Street and Jigsaw are in fact so annoying I simply turned my iPod off.     I don't recommend this album. It is a classic example of an album that, because everybody SAYS it is good, is accepted as good.  This is not true, and this album should be considered in the same group as the other \\"wobbly\\" Stones albums, along with Buttons and Satanic Majesties.

B002436WFI|5.0|A fun movie for everyone. You don't need to have read Pratchett's books to enjoy it but it does add to the fun.  It's not a spoof, it's not satire, it's a good (and funny) fantasy all by itself. Highly recommended. Note: no gag reel.
B003V4AK8E|2.0|I wanted a PS3 controller with a form fitting design, and one with proper triggers.  Power A got the form fitting part right, but the rest of the controller is a downgrade from the Dualshock 3 and really feels nothing like the 360 pad.    Pros     - Ergonomic shape, fits the shape of your hands better than Sony's controllers  - Analog placement matches the 360s.  This is only a pro if this is your preference.  I find both layouts equally comfortable.  They just take some getting used to.  - Light-up buttons.  Sure they have no practical use (anyone can memorize 4 buttons in a short amount of time) but it's kind of cool.    Cons    - The Triggers.  It's the main reason I bought this controller and it is the biggest disappointment.  They are spongey and pressure sensitive like the DS3, but they are way too stiff and give too much resistance when pressing.  They are also smaller and have less depth than either the Dualshock 3 or 360 controllers triggers.  About the only thing they did right with them was making them concave.    - The Analog Sticks have a very noticeable dead zone, and they sit way too high on the controller.  Being about 6 ft tall my hands are not small, yet when holding this controller my thumbs really feel like they are stretching to gain control of the sticks.  I am fully aware of the benefits of taller analogs, I use FPS Freeks with my 360 pad.  Unfortunately these sticks stretch out your thumbs much more awkwardly and the dead zone kills any benefit taller analogs might have given.    As for the rest of the controller, nothing else stands out as overwhelmingly good or bad.  Just average.    This is a disappointing product and I do not recommend it.  I've since learned to stick with the Dualshock 3, despite the convex triggers (there is a product called Real Triggers that helps remedy this) and the small non ergonomic shape it's still the best option for PS3 gamers.    Side Note:  With FPS games on the Playstation 3 you never know whether the developers will opt for the R1 or R2 to shoot.  We can only hope they let us customize it, but I can assure you that using R1 to shoot using this controller feels as weird as trying to use the Right Bumper to shoot in Halo 3.
B004EQAVFU|1.0|I just painfully sat thought this movie and I wish I read spoilers before purchasing this movie.  For one thing this movie made almost go asleep.    For the outside of movie, I thought this would be good love story, in fact it does not leave much sympathy for any of the characters. I could understand this if this was taken place in the future - but in the past just makes it so unrealistic - why didn't these characters get up and leave - or complain to some orgainization of something.  In todays world this would never have been allow which makes the movie pretty stupid.    Recommend the following movie instead.  [...]

0307272702|3.0|I thought this book was good, but I thought it was extremely frustrating to have to get 80 pages in to read that, yes, in fact, Taubes thinks that we shouldn't overeat (because he was basically going on and on about how he disliked the \\"calories in calories out\\" advice we get from all sources) and that we shouldn't under eat our daily recommended intake of calories. But that's because I realize that undereating isn't healthy; so, if you are like me, stick with the book it's still informative. I loved all the historical research and the scientific facts as to what goes on inside the body when the calories we eat are absorbed (or not absorbed, based off the quality of food we eat). I liked knowing the relationship between insulin, hormones and fat as well as the extra information I didn't know about good and bad cholesterol. But, I did have to remind myself that it's not a diet book and that it was explaining the processes of how the body metabolizes food and what we need to eat so that our bodies perform the way they should; it's easy to get wrapped up in wondering when the diet and exercise information will start to pop up if you are used to reading diet books. If you are looking for a diet book, the basic information in this book translated into a diet book can be found in a south beach, atkins, or zone diet books. If you want to know the \\"whys\\" behind the advice these books recommend, read this. I find it's easier to follow marching orders if it's understood why they are given.

Carrey does a remarkable acting job in this serious role; he is sympathetic and convincing as the writer whose life takes a turn for the unexpected.<br /><br />The female interest, Adele Stanton, is played by Laurie Holden while other supporting roles are played by seasoned veterans of movies and TV such as Martin Landau, Hal Holbrook, David Stiers and others.<br /><br />When Appleton is accused of possible communist connections he reacts by getting drunk, going for a long drive, crashing and losing his memory. He is discovered and taken to a small coastal community where he is mistaken for the son of a local man and nursed back to health.<br /><br />The story focuses on his gradual rehabilitation and his increasing involvement in the small town's life. Things take a turn for the worse when his wrecked car is discovered and the FBI starts looking in that area of California for their missing man. From that point on the pace picks up as the viewer watches the conclusion of the movie and what would have to be considered a happy ending.<br /><br />The movie is worth seeing, especially if you have an interest in seeing right triumph over bureaucracy.
0515141429|3.0|In honor of Jack Reacher, I have left my family, sold my worldly possessions, and quit my job. I am now aimlessly wondering the lower 48.  And who knows, I may end up in Alaska living off the fat of the land, or Hawaii working as the body guard to a physician who specializes in controversial, yet legal, medical procedures. That is, if my ever dwindling money roll allows for trans-oceanic travel.    I digress.  My point is that while it is entertaining and enjoyable, Killing Floor lacks the versimilitude that some of Child's other novels subtly incorporate.  I would also submit that it is short on the ingredient that arguably made this series, i.e. action.  And I found some of the detail trivial and meaningless, while several of the action sequences lacked the detail that I found so enjoyable in, for instance, Worth Dying For.    This is the fifth of the Reacher series that I have read.  Each of the books have been entertaining, however, I am still looking for the same rush that I felt while rapidly consuming the aforementioned Worth Dying For.
B0011UF79C|3.0|In a future where genetic manipulation has reached the point that most sicknesses and defects can be eliminated at conception, one man (whose parents didn't opt for this procedure) faces discrimination from more \\"perfect\\" people. He finds a way to pose as a genetically perfect person so he can pursue his dream of being an astronaut, but a murder investigation stands the chance of exposing him...<br /><br />Although competently made, the film suffers from being overly-preachy -- based (intentionally?) on a misunderstanding of eugenics -- and in itself has a couple of gaping plot holes. Add to that Uma Thurmon's utterly lifeless performance and lack of chemistry with the rest of the cast, and you have a film that has a hint of potential that it fails to live up to.<br /><br />I *tried* to like this film, too. I'm surprised there is such a \\"cult\\" following for it. At best it is worth watching once.
0679735909|4.0|I loved the combination of modern and historical fiction and the multiple ways of telling the story: third person narrative, poetry, journals, and letters.    The title, \\"Possession\\" is germane to more than one aspect of the story.  The word relates to the feelings of possession and protectiveness experienced by scholars of those they research and study and love, the possessiveness of collectors to have things at all costs not from a great love or concern but solely for the game of acquiring, and it explores the questions that arise about dominance, control, and independence in the relationships between man and woman as lovers and colleagues.    The book in its dual nature of past and present also explores the dichotomy of our modern world with that of the Victorian.  It imbues us with a sense that many things have changed but many fundamental instincts have remained the same and we are still grappling with those issues today.    A wonderful read and highly recommended!
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is in a 16mm format which of course cannot utilize the right and left part of modern televisions which is a good thing as that means that we are provided with the whole original image as opposed to what so many editors do when converting older video to a new format, namely crop out a large portion of the image in order to have it \\"fill\\" the screen.  What a travisty that this is ever done, but then there is never a dirth of poor taste in this industry.  This documentary is dated in some ways, but why would it not be as it was done in 1970s.  The advantage to this is that many people were still alive to interview.   Though possibly a bit Great Brittain-centric this is the most complete video documentary of the second world war and is well worth the reasonable cost.  It's one to watch when one cannot sleep at night and wants to see something to make us feel better - aint it nice that we are not in the middle of a conflict such as this war was ?

B004NFB4EO|4.0|At first, I didn't really like the song.  I felt there was no melody and it was just derivative.  Certainly not Lady GaGa's best work.  But then the more I listened to it, the more I liked it.  The peppy message certainly helps things along.  It's just a really fun and energetic song.      I'm a straight woman, so the gay theme doesn't speak to me personally-- but I think the \\"born this way\\" theme can be applied to anyone.      And at least Lady GaGa has a song with a message-- it's speaking from the heart which I respect in an artist.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I had not been a frequent viewer of Glee, catching it every now and then in re-runs over the summer. But when I had a bit of Christmas money, decided to order the First Season on DVD thinking it would be a great way to brighten the winter days and evenings. I was not disappointed! My only complaint is that I got so into the music and antics of the cast that I kept watching and ended up staying up WAY TOO late on several evenings. The kooky characters only add to the fun of these episodes. Definitely worth watching and am glad to have added it into my collection.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|Garth Brook's Ultimate Hits is a strong and high-quality collection. The bonus to owning this collection is that you get two cds and one dvd of Garth Brook's greatest hits.  This cd does have many of his greatest hits.  Here are some of the hits that are my personal favorites in this compilation:<br />\\"In Another's Eyes\\"<br />\\"We Shall Be Free\\"<br />\\"Shameless\\"<br />\\"The River\\"<br />\\"The Dance\\"<br /><br />  The one thing that I am suprised about is the fact that the song \\"You Move Me\\" was left off this compilation. The other songs included are great and make obtaining this greatest hits collection worth it.  However, the reason why I feel like \\"You Move Me\\" would have been beneficial to include in this compilation is because it is a loving, beautiful, and uplifting song about how his lover touches him. The theme of \\"You Move Me\\" would have went wonderfully with the other love songs that are included on this Garth Brook's greatest hits collection. This collection is best to get if you enjoy country music and/or you are an occasional country music listener who enjoys collecting greatest hit compilations of talented musicians.

B00005NTN5|4.0|Jennifer Tilly and Joe Pantoliano steal the show in this run-of-the-mill noir crime caper movie from the Wachowski Brothers. As to the rest of the cast, unfortunately, poor Gina Gershon is relegated to co-star status and given a woefully too-small role and Christopher Meloni shines in another unfortunately too-small role.<br /><br />Bound was well plotted and stylishly directed and filmed, and had a satisfying climax, when it was all said and done there was nothing that separated this from the pack for me other than the lesbian relationship between Tilly and Gershon. Unfortunately, I never felt a real connection between the two of them and while the sex scenes were hot, they left me feeling that they were included more as a gimmick then anything else.<br /><br />It's really difficult for me to criticize this movie other than to say the caper plot wasn't original and it makes me just a little sad knowing that the Wachowski Brothers followed up this fun movie with the Matrix stuff.<br /><br />I'd recommend Bound to anyone with a warning for violence.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is the HBO miniseries adaptation of Stephen Ambrose's book of the same name that detailed the actions of the 101st Airborne Division's Easy Company during World War II. The story starts during paratrooper training and takes us to D-Day and Bastogne and eventually to the end of the war. I don't know how the miniseries holds up against the book, but as a stand alone series, this is some great stuff and is about as close to \\"must see\\" television as possible. The drama of individual characters is sacrificed for the drama of the war itself so this is no star vehicle for any one actor and the stories of the soldiers themselves are never brought into the plot. The tension in the battle scenes is palpable and because of their realism, they're very difficult to watch.<br /><br />Congratulations to Stephen Spielberg, Tom Hanks and HBO. This is about as close to perfect as anything on the screen can be. Each episode starts with some brief comments by actual members of Easy Company and each episode ends with a brief written summary of what was happening in the war after the time frame of the episode. The inclusion of these two pieces helped frame each episode beautifully.<br /><br />Please don't turn away from Band of Brothers because you don't like war movies because this is an amazing series that goes beyond being \\"just\\" another war story. As the title implies, this is ultimately the story of soldiers, ordinary men in an extraordinary situation, who live through, and deal with, some horrible situations and how they cope and survive and become really more than brothers. It's also an easy-to-swallow history lesson.<br /><br />I'm still going to hold out on I, Claudius being the best miniseries ever made, but Band of Brothers is right up there. My only complaints with the series was that I would have liked more individual character development of the soldiers and I felt that it was assumed the viewer had at least basic knowledge of the events being covered in each episode which seemed a little unfair to some viewers. However, the Field Guide in the DVD extras and the performances of Donnie Wahlberg, David Schwimmer and Neal McDonough (three actors I've never cared for before seeing them here, but who all turned in brilliant performances) were enough to counter any small complaints I may have had.<br /><br />Recommended for everyone with the caveat that this miniseries contains scenes of very graphic violence and intense combat action.<br /><br />Also recommended for anyone interested in movies about some of the events covered in the miniseries are Battleground (1949) and The Longest Day (1962) and A Bridge Too Far (1977).a little unfair to some viewers.

B00003CWN3|2.0|I really have mixed feelings about Boys Don't Cry. The acting was great (Hilary Swank and especially Chloe Svigney) and the story was interesting, but I couldn't help but feel manipulated by the movie's director. The characters were either all good, or all bad and I didn't think anything in the movie was presented objectively.<br /><br />Brandon, despite having many prior arrests (and mental illness?) was never presented as anything other than good, albeit confused. When you boil the person down, what was Brandon besides a liar? Help was available for her, but she didn't want it. Despite her feelings toward everyone, all she did in the end was lie to them. Granted, she had a reason to lie, but why wasn't anyone hurt by her lies, especially Lana?<br /><br />And what was the deal with the accents? This was Nebraska, not Texas, but everyone was talking with a really strong southern accent.<br /><br />The rape scene was horribly brutal and the sex scenes were pretty hot, but for me this was just a depressing movie about some very sad and depressing people and not nearly as well written as another very sad and depressing movie about sad and depressing people: Midnight Cowboy.<br /><br />I also don't know what urgent social issues the movie explored. Gay hate crimes? Yeah, for maybe ten minutes out of the whole movie. Homosexuality? Not that I ever saw. Gender issues? Again, not that I ever saw.<br /><br />I would recommend Boys Don't Cry only to someone who either wants to watch a depressing movie that doesn't make a lot of sense, or to fans of Chloe Sevigny and Hilary Swank.

B00004RJ71|4.0|At three hours and ten minutes I think Blood In, Blood Out should have come with a Certificate of Completion to hang next to the DVD player. I don't say that because I thought the movie was bad, but camping out on the couch for half a day (I like bathroom and snack breaks) requires a big commitment.<br /><br />Blood In Blood Out (which seemed like a really corny title until I watched the movie) is the story of three 'carnals' (brothers) growing up in East Los Angeles and, as in Angels with Dirty Faces, the different paths their lives take from their beginnings in a local gang after one fateful night. The movie covers about fifteen years in the lives of the brothers and I don't want to give anything away, so I won't talk about any of the characters, or their paths, other than to say that one of the 'carnals' winds up in prison and it's in these prison scenes where I think the movie really excels.<br /><br />I thought Blood In, Blood Out was a very good movie and I can honestly say that at no time during the 3+ hours did I find myself bored, or the story lagging, and off the top of my head I can't think of another epic movie where that didn't happen. Even during Brian De Palma's Scarface there's a scene where I always start to get a little bored.<br /><br />Blood In Blood Out is a good movie that's well directed and manages to balance the three stories quite well while never once losing the focus of the power of the bonds of honor that binds the three brothers, or other family, together. The three main characters are fully fleshed out and real and regardless of your personal feelings for them, you care about them.<br /><br />I thought Blood In, Blood Out was a fascinating story of a group that I find interesting and will never be a part of, and I truly felt that this movie brought me as close to this culture as I'll probably ever get. Unfortunately, with the good comes some bad and one big problem I had with the movie was the acting. I thought the lead actor (Damian Chapa) was pretty bad and he gave one of the worst performances I've seen outside of a direct-to-video, grade B, zombie movie, in a long time. Why he was cast in the title role is beyond me. Many of the other actors were also guilty of overacting, and since I've seen some of these actors in other roles (Jesse Borrego, Enrique Castillo) where they weren't overacting, maybe that was the way they were directed to act for some reason? Ving Rhames, playing some sort of gang specialist working in the prison was not guilty of overacting, but since he can't act in the first place it's not an issue. It was nice to see Richard Masur in a bit part as well as one of my favorite actors, Danny Trejo. Overall, despite what I thought was some subpar acting, this was a good movie. To clarify my definition of subpar, I thought Benjamin Bratt was the best actor in the movie and that's a scary thought!<br /><br />I recommend Blood In, Blood Out to anyone with a caution that some may find some of the language objectionable.one of the worst performances I've seen outside of a direct-to-video, grade B, zombie movie, in a long time.

B00005JOFQ|2.0|Is beautiful cinematography enough to make a movie? This was a beautifully filmed movie and a joy to watch from that standpoint, but it was also overlong and very slowly paced and offered no real character motivation or development. Brokeback Mountain is based on a 20-page short story, and I learned more about the characters in those 20 pages than I did in this two plus hour movie and that bothered me. The other thing that bothered me about the movie was while it took place over the course of nearly 20 years, there were really no visible signs of aging in the two main characters. Longer sideburns and a mustache on Jack and that was supposed signify the passage of time?<br /><br />In the short story it's very clear why Ennis is so hesitant to pursue his relationship with Jack and I really think they needed to do more in the movie to make that information known than the thirty seconds they gave it. For whatever reason, they decided that information wasn't important, or maybe they wanted us to try and come to our own conclusions, but as a result, the tragedy of the love story is completely lost along with all the social issues surrounding their relationship. I can't deny the movie was emotional, but I think with some character motivation it could have been much more that it was. It could have been a love story that was remembered for the relationship between the two principle characters. As it stands now, it will be remembered, but only because it dared to deal with a taboo topic and that's not only unfortunate, but insulting.<br /><br />I thought Heath Ledger was very good in the movie and I think he deserved the Oscar nomination. After seeing the movie I wouldn't have been unhappy had he actually won, but maybe that's based more on my bias of rewarding actors with Oscars for doing impersonations in movies, as opposed to acting a character. Jake Gyllenhaal proved to me that he's nothing but an average actor who's yet to move beyond his work in Bubble Boy.<br /><br />Brokeback Mountain wasn't a bad movie, but it also wasn't a very good movie, or a movie that made a lot of sense and I think most of the attention it received was because of hype. Too bad, because, as I mentioned earlier, with some character development and motivation this could have been a really good love story.<br /><br />I understand how the movie won the Oscar for best screenplay from previously published material since the writers had to take a 20 minute short story and convert it into a 2 hour and 10 minute movie.<br /><br />I recommend Brokeback Mountain only to someone interested in seeing beautiful cinematography.a bad movie, but it also wasn't a very good movie, or a movie that made a lot of sense and I think most of the attention it received was because of hype.

I must say I was pleasantly surprised and highly entertained by their version.  It's not exact but close enough, I will not nitpick.  They captured the spirit of the books and that's all anyone can really ask when going from one  medium to another.<br />The look of this movie is stunning.  The acting is universally welldone.  I am definitely keeping this in my vast DVD collection for future viewings.  I'm only sad that it appears, at this stage, that the movie is but a one-off, the series will not be finished, nor does it look like there will be a director's cut forthcoming.  Oh well.

B001SS3JS8|3.0|I don't really know what to think of this book. When I read the back of the book I was really intrigued and since I've read some of Picoult's books before, I thought this one would be as good as the others. It was. Sort of. I feel like the whole suicide thing was kind of unnecessary, given Emily's issues. Honestly, there are people that go through far worse, and don't go as far as suicide. But I understand that people carry their weight in different ways. I just think it's a hard think to judge the book, mainly because I've never been in a situation like it, so I can't criticize Picoult's view of some of the characters. Take Melanie for example. I started getting really pissed at her by the way she reacted, and then I thought that I didn't lose a child, so I don't know how she feels. Everyone had a different reaction to the tragedy. It annoyed me though, that Emily really did have everything. She had love, not only from Chris, but from everyone around her. She was smart, talented, beautiful. Whatever happened to her in the past, should've been dealt, so she wouldn't get where she did. Just the fact that she kept her mouth shut, angers me, because maybe what happened to her, happened to more girls, because she didn't speak up. But that's another matter entirely.  It's amazing to see Chris and Emily's love. It's deep, it's pure, and somehow dark.  THis is a good book. Not amazing. And definetely not a can't-put-down-book. Just so so. 19 minutes was a lot more interesting.

B001DJ7PR8|5.0|Spanish guitars<br />Penelope Cruz<br />Scarlet Johansson<br />Ancient Spanish Architecture<br />Good Wine<br /><br />I thought the movie was too silly the first few minutes and was starting to doubt the wisdom of the Hollywood Foreign Press for giving the best comedy and musical award to this film but after listening to the narrator and soaking in the beauty of Spain and the cultural differences between polite Americans and romantic Spanish painters, I was hooked. As I write this, I'm watching it for the second time.<br /><br />Juan Antonio is everything I'm not, confident, forward, colorful and an artist. His candor makes him interesting and he is not afraid to act instinctively. Seducing the two American tourists in the restaurant is a classic scene and should be required viewing for any man wanting to get over inhibitions and breaking the ice with women.<br /><br />The movie makes me want to drink a large goblet of red wine and rethink my conservative, Catholic views of sexuality. Set against the beauty of ancient Spain, flamenco guitar cords and Johansson and Cruz's charm and beauty, Woody Allen does a great job of contrasting our American everyday insipid lives to the volatile colorful ups and downs of Europe's artists.<br /><br />If you are feeling somewhat down and need a shot of confidence against the backdrop of colorful paintings and the small flower shops in Spain, this romantic comedy will surely inspire.
B0018TLRTK|3.0|Considering Billy Idol has a single disc Greatest Hits already, which is pretty similiar, I think a nice 30 track double would have been a better choice. Most of the essential 80's stuff is included, but why not a couple from his first band Generation X. Also, throw us a track or two from Vital Idol. That remix album was huge when it came out. My favorite album front-to-back is Charmed Life, so why not give us \\"Trouble With The Sweet Stuff\\" or one of 5 other kick ass songs from that release. The Doors cover is ok, I suspect it's here to remind us he was in that movie. We could have also used a few more tracks from his last two albums, and kept that \\"Don't You Forget About Me\\" cover from the Greatest Hits. Oh right...I'm reviewing this disc. Good set, maybe a hair better than the last one. Depends on which songs you prefer.

B00006J9OT|5.0|Since Canadian jazz singer/pianist Diana Krall burst on the popular music scene around two decades ago, I've always been amazed that much of the \\"buzz\\" about her has centered on her singing.  What I will say about her singing is that she makes the best of a limited range and less than stellar vocal clarity.  In voice, she is bested by her fellow Canadian pianist/vocalist Carol Welsman or 16-year old (in 2011) Canadian singer Nikki Yanofsky--both have more pleasant voices, better vocal clarity, and both can swing a tune vocally on par with Ms Krall.  Certainly, Ms. Krall's singing is passable and better than about 90% of the pop slop out there and that may account for some of her vocal popularity.  Some of Ms. Krall's albums have pandered too much to those popular audiences to suit this jazz purist, as well.  Fortunately, this album does not do that and this, in my opinion, is her best album to date.    If Ms. Krall's singing is less than stellar, the same can not be said for her piano playing.  In fact, she is without doubt one of the best, hardest swinging jazz pianists alive today.  If she never sang another note, she would still be a top jazz lion.  (A jazz musician friend is more direct about it--he says that Ms. Krall shouldn't sing at all because it distracts the listener from her superb jazz chops on the piano.  He adds that if Diana the singer and Diana the pianist were two people, Diana the singer would be angry at Diana the piano player for stealing the show.)  The song choices on this album are also excellent--mostly jazz standards that suit Ms. Krall's playing perfectly.  Another huge highlight of this album is her band--an all-star group of swinging musicians.  Unlike some vocalists/pianists, Ms. Krall is not afraid to feature them prominently during the course of this album.  The audio qulaity of this albume is excellent, too--exceptionally good for a live recording.  All in all, this album is best characterized as a first-rate jazz pianist and supporting group making a passable singer look pretty darned good.    One final note--having reviewed Canadian singer Nikki Yanofsky's two albums recently, I have to pose this question:  How is it that a country with a population smaller than that of California consistently produces a disproportionately large share of fine jazz musicians and popular singers compared to what we in the United States seem to be able to muster these days?  For me, that is an open question . . .

If you have not read the book yet and intend to, do not read this review.<br /><br />It is very evocative of a time... the 1950's looking back at the three decades beforehand... and gives you a feeling of what it must have been like to be in a convent,  on mission, or work in a hospital during that time...  The inner struggle of Sr. Luke is well done.  Certain incidents seemed quite realistic..  Ditto what all the other reviewers said.  Because someone brought up the issue of colonial racism in the book, I would argue that yes, it's there all right, but as another reviewer has said, it's true to the perspective of what a white Belgian or perhaps a white American or English person would have thought during that time period..  Because a book has this perspective, does this invalidate it as not being worth reading? That's for the reader to decide.<br /><br />One of the things I did not like was the way the book ended..  Not to give a spoiler, but I found it extremely unsatisfactory and really not in keeping with the rest of the book.  I realize that this book is based on the life of an actual person who ended up doing what Sr. Luke did, but in terms of the novel, Sr. Luke's struggles and character development, it did not seem consistent with what came earlier.<br /><br />It did seem quite believable that she would make this decision DURING THE WAR, a time of incredible stress.  BUT I did not see why she did not ask for a temporary leave of absence to discern things,  It seems that the strain of being in that place at that time basically distorted reality for her.. she basically imploded in on herself in a way that was tragic in light of all that came before...  Her decision seemed impulsive based totally on self will.  Also, given the time period and the excellent formation she received, it is especially sad that she would really want to give up her vows.  There  did not seem sufficient motivation for it.  It is TRAGIC that she left and TRAGIC that she could not have dealt with this crisis in a better way.<br /><br />As a side note,her prayer life at one point (towards the end of the book) became arid, and she takes it as sign that she should leave religious life.  A good counterpoint to the nun in this novel is Mother Teresa's private writings, Come be My light, where spiritual aridity added rather than detracted to her striving for holiness.  The ending of the novel makes the reader think that maybe Sr. Luke all along was trying to please herself rather than God; but that message is not in keeping with the rest of the book..  and even though the author is dead now, this was a work of fiction, not a biography, and I am not sure why she did not choose to fictionalize the end, i.e., have her stay... as it would have made for a better story.<br /><br />Finally, the ending was prophetic and especially tragic in light of what was to come in the next 20 years, the mass exodus of nuns from religious life in droves for perhaps reasons similar to Sr. Luke's.  The author could not have known this in 1956.hat she left and TRAGIC that she could not have dealt with this crisis in a better way.

B001RIY4WE|5.0|The definitive T2 release for your collection. Throw out all your old ones (including the first Blu-ray release with its horrible transfer.) Beautiful transfer, audio, and all the commentaries and versions of the film. Amazing. Every extra ever released all included.
B002ZG994U|4.0|This movie is a fun movie, but an absurd one -- and it makes no secret of the fact. It is, therefore, enjoyable as comedy-action.<br />The characters are a band of misfits, weirdos and even a mentally unstable individual...but they're also super loyal, super skilled, super warriors. The adventures they go on are completely outrageous, but so are the characters...this is comedic action, after all. The storyline is a mediocre and implausible, but nonetheless entertaining, one -- in keeping with the rest of the film.<br />This was by no means a CGI masterpiece (nor did I expect it to be), but there were times when things looked way too fake...like in the scene where everything was collapsing at the dock. There was also (spoiler) the cliched evil military contractors, Black Forest, up to no good, which was a little distracting by virtue of sheer overused stupidity...I donno who out there is thinking, \\"Gee, how about *another* movie/TV show/book about some ultra-villainous group of inept, abusive contractors who will have a name that hints to Blackwater, because that's sooooo original!\\"...but they need to get on with it. As it is, in A-Team, they refer to the Blackwater, errr, Black Forest guys as trigger happy frat boys...I don't know what planet they live on, but, in real life, inept kids in combat die...they don't become super villains. But I digress...<br />Anyhow, the A-Team characters were all pretty likable, the adventures were entertaining, and the story was interesting enough to keep you watching. Again, this is NOT a serious attempt at a military intrigue/action film...this is meant to be a fun, silly movie, and it achieves that.<br />4/5 stars, for an amusing film that doesn't pretend to be anything that it's not
B003DZX44I|5.0|BEAUTIFUL HI-DEF TRANSFER OF DISNEY CLASSIC. The quality will leave you with your jaw WIDEopen. And the movie is the best animated movie ever, period.
B000QEIORG|5.0|I have loved this album since I first heard it, almost 15 years ago.  From beginning to end, it is absolutely incredible and it has an amazing range of styles for an hard rock/alternative rock album.  After the tender beginning, the breakdown on \\"February Stars\\" sounds absolutely gigantic.  As teenagers, my brother and I agreed that \\"Everlong\\" was the best rock song of all time, and to this day, after much more music experience, I'm not exactly convinced that this isn't true.  I could go on and on.  Like all truly great albums, when I listen to The Colour and The Shape, I feel like I've been transported to another place and time.  An epic achievement.
0920668372|1.0|O.k..I get the whole moral/parable/message the author was trying to convey...and believe me, I have read HUNDREDS of books to my 2 girls....Guess How much I love you....The Giving Tree...But I am sorry - this book is just plain WEIRD.    O.k..I just don´t know where to begin....perhaps at the pschyo Mom (long black dress , white hair) who crawls on all four to go into her teenage sons room to rock him...to getting in a pickup in the middle of the night, tieing a ladder to the truck and climbing into her ADULT son´s window to rock him? Whatever happened to 1. the door and 2. there are others ways of showing your love...I swear I thought the author was going to add that the Mom wore a diaper so she would not have to stop driving one second!    Its just weird. period. I was like o.k. til the 7th page and then I was like huh?      The funny thing is this book was passed to me by another Mom ......she said read it and tell me what you think... She thought it was so darn weird she had to ask me what I thought!    Bingo!
1439190275|5.0|Great book.  Leave preconceived notions at the door.  Very Healthy, and you will most likely end up eating more vegetables than you do now.  One week, down 12 lbs.  But excited about the future and staying healthy.  Book really explains very well how the body processes carbs, proteins, and fats.  Very interesting how the body fuels itself with high insulin levels (after eating a lot of carbs.) vs how it fuels itself with a much smaller amount of carbs.  Sure, we heard high fructose corn syrup is bad, but now I know why I want to take a more active role in avoiding it.  Overall, I feel great and believe that this Atkins book simply describes a way of eating that has a lot in common with other diets, such as WWatchers and the Zone.  The later stages of Atkins would easily fall within other diet's guidelines.  So it makes sense that the best and most effective diets would have one eating similar things in the 'maintaining healthy for life' stages.  The Atkins path lets me get there without calorie restrictions that left me hungry in other \\"diets\\" when I chose to eat a larger portion of my daily calories in the carb category.  Atkins eliminates the bouncing blood sugar levels and cuts the cravings for sweets.  By doing so, you will eat less and feel much better.  If you think you cant be healthy and lose weight by eating all the bacon, cheese, and meat you want, you are right.  And while that was not the old Atkins, it did have that vibe.  But for sure it is not the New Atkins.
B004DTLK8A|1.0|For some reason I have a soft spot for STRATOVARIUS.  Maybe because I find the first CD I bought by them \\"Visions\\" to be such an exceptional CD.  Maybe because I have seen them live several times and they are always outstanding in that environment.  I need to let it go.  They have not released anything decent since \\"Infinite\\" (1999) and even there you could already sense the softening and weakening of the band.  This latest album was a horrible mistake to purchase.  It is mainly soft radio rock.  You can't even blame Timo Tolkki and his bizzare personality anymore! Sure there are a few moments of excpetional musicianship found here, and rarely there.  Gone is the energy and passion this band once had.  There is not even a fragment of metal remaining.  That, in and of itself is ok.  But this album just lays there with absolutely no character or soul.  Its as if they needed to record something, went into the studio, and came up with this uninspired waste.  I keep hoping that I'll be surprised by STRATOVARIUS and they will go back to thier roots.  I guess not.  If this is the real STRATOVARIUS please sit down, and stay down.

B003EYVXTG|2.0|This movie could have been a meaningful look at the scourge of meth in America, but instead becomes a hackneyed 21st century hillbilly tale. The lazy shoeless hillbilly moonshiners have been replaced by cruel unfeeling clannish losers. This is like so many movies made, a stylized artists conception of life in these poor ozarks hills. I have spent the last 26 years working in law enforcement and the emergency medical field in southwest Missouri, and the reality of meth(crank) is all to pervasive, but this is not a blighted wasteland. The rural areas are primarily agricultural, and the majority of meth people I have dealt with,(and there have been hundreds) are involved with meth because they became addicted from recreational use, or they don't want to work for a living. Don't get me wrong, the reality of meth on the family is devastating. Total loss of all the family has and complete breakdown of the family itself, but this is a choice made by people involved to use and manufacture meth, not that there is no way far a family to make an honest living in the Missouri ozarks. The cost of living here is actually quite low so you can live well here on much less than most of the country.
B004HD2ZK4|5.0|What a long strange journey its been for ...And You Will Know Us by The Trail Of Dead; A band that seemingly reinvents itself with each new album. Tao Of The Dead finds head-Dead member Conrad Keely channeling his prog-rock affectations into a remarkably cohesive set of songs that works best when listened to as two epic song cycles. Tao Of The Dead Part I is so good that at nearly forty minutes it almost feels too brief - you're almost tempted to hit the replay button once the final notes of \\"The Fairlight Pendant\\" trail off into the ether... thankfully that lingering is quickly satiated by the equally impressive sixteen and half minute \\"Strange News From Another Planet,\\" a song that moves from roaring punk anthems to beautiful, shimmering soundscapes almost in the same breath. It all adds up to one fantastic listening experience. I can't recommend this album highly enough.

0312600844|4.0|As John Updike did before him, Jonathan Franzen is capturing an era, detailing its public upheavals and personal concerns in ways to which readers can easily relate--at least those of us who have been middle-class adults since the century began. Freedom is a long book, much of it focused on personal minutae, and it is a testament to Franzen's talent that its pace rarely lags. Inasmuch as fiction writers can contribute as much as their non-fiction colleagues to the chronicle of the times in which they live (which obviously is true), Franzen is a worthy contributor to ours.<br /><br />complete review is at marywwaltersbookreviews at wordpress dot com

B000UAE7RW|5.0|Instead, check out the excellent contributions here from Marc Mayerson, Dennis Mccafferty, and my main man, C. CRADDOCK. What can I say that hasn't been said already? Indeed, two hundred out of the 254 reviews are 5-star. Essentially then, my review is a vote *for* Amazon's review system as much as it is for this classic film noir.<br /><br />Just a note from a technical perspective: my release (2007's \\"Special Collector's Edition\\") is very nice in terms of picture and sound. The only important feature it lacks from the more recent 2009 [[ASIN:B002HK9HR8 release]] is a commentary track. Conversely, I prefer the cover art of the even older 1999 [[ASIN:B000022TSF release]]. But that is a tiny preference; you won't be looking at the DVD case while you watch the film. Instead you will be wondering how the direction, script, acting, score, costumes, lighting, and everything else came together so perfectly. Too bad Chinatown was up against The Godfather: Part II for the Oscar, because it would have won for Best Picture virtually any other year.
B000001EL3|5.0|This is the 1st KISS album I ever bought, and yes I had it on vinyl in 1976. I was all of 10 years old at the time. Up until that point I was raised on AM radio to the likes of Barry Manilow, The Carpenters, Neil Diamond and what seemed like an overkill of mediocre soft rock/easy listening music. Destroyer changed my life and my musical interests completely! I had never heard anything like this before and I was enthralled. Not knowing what a concept album was, I reveled in the journey Destroyer took me on. Once I got turned on to KISS, I was never the same. I played this album over and over until the grooves wore out. The opening track Detroit Rock City is a hard driving, heart pounding release of aggression. What a great cruisin' tune! God Of Thunder with Gene's demonic vocals and Ace's doomsday guitar riffs stands in a class by itself. On Flaming Youth and Shout It Out loud, Paul is singing exactly what I was feeling as a pre-teen. Then I heard the ballad Beth by Peter which at first didn't seem like it fit but is a gentle cry for love and tolerance amid the wild Rock God lifestyle. The album closes with a kick in the teeth - Do You Love Me is the perfect ending to what I consider one of, if not the best KISS album (CD) ever made. If you want a taste (or a mouthful) of what Kiss is all about you must get this, you won't be disappointed.
B002ZG99N6|5.0|Let me say upfront that I had never been impressed with Ben Affleck's acting abilities as I have always found him somewhat wooden and limited in emotional range.  However, I was quite impressed with not just Ben's acting but also his directing skills in this movie.  The plot has enough twists to keep you guessing and the acting is excellent all around.  Perhaps its because many of the recent movies I have seen have not lived up to my expectations, but I think this movie stands out among a lot of the other movies that are being made.  Highly reccomended.

B00006LLLN|5.0|I first heard Alison Krauss on, of all things, a hi-fi demonstration disc, which included \\"New Favorite\\" with its outstanding production. At the time, I wouldn't have known Alison Krauss if I'd fallen over her, but I bought the CD, expecting a typical collection of pop diva stuff, one good song and the rest filler. To my surprise, it was bluegrass, which I've always enjoyed. So I tried this one.<br /><br />This is stunning stuff. This girl can sing. B'gosh, This Girl Can Sing! If she sang \\"Baa, baa, black sheep\\", I think I'd be tempted to buy it. Not only that, but she can also play a mean fiddle. And to cap it all, she's part of a band of outstanding ability. The result is an absolute aural treat. Even \\"New Favorite\\" is sung with almost complete fidelity to the original. And the final number \\"Oh, Atlanta\\" just about brings the house down. Alison Krauss is a good-looking doll with so much talent that she can just stand and sing and has no need to prance around in her underwear, as apparently do other popular lady vocalists. She also comes across as a pleasant, unaffected person. Highest recommendation.<br /><br />P.S. Can any of you Stateside folk please explain to a poor Yurpeen why, in \\"Oh, Atlanta\\", she pronounces \\"Georgia\\" as something like \\"Chug-a-chew\\"?
1594481717|5.0|I absolutely love this book!  Though I agree with another reviewer that he doesn't delve deep into explanations on how the principles discussed lead to business success in the specific sense, I can certainly see how they can enhance one's personal and spiritual growth (depending on how \\"spiritual\\" is defined for you personally).  In addition, much of what he says rings true to me with regard to cultural changes and how they impact current and future marketability of goods and services.  He discusses three things and their impacts on business success -- abundance, Asia, and automation (i.e., too much to choose from to the point of sensory overload, outsourcing, and computer takeover).  Well, he kind of discusses the impact, but doesn't really lay it out completely.  Nevertheless, he does well enough of a job to get the point across.  I don't think he needs to write on each topic ad nauseum as some seem to suggest.  In fact, much of what is written here seems like common sense to me.  With that said, most who know me well will agree that I engage in more R-directed thinking than L-directed thinking.  Suffice it to say, there are many people who could benefit from reading this book even if deep explanations are not provided.  It may be an eye opener for them.  This book presents the basic business concept of setting yourself apart from the crowd in an enlightening and inspirational way (that sentence has a double meaning).  It contains scores of fun suggestions and exercises that I'm going to put into practice very soon (these range from suggested readings, web tests, magazines, museums, spiritual endeavors, quirky clubs, and the list goes on ...).  As someone who is starting a new business, I found this book inspirational, but at the same time, it wasn't really about business.  I found it to be more about finding my happy place and learning how to spend as much of my life as possible living in it.<br /><br />Even if you don't find the book to be the perfect cup of tea for you, you will likely find a few little gems, so it will be well worth the money you spend on it.  Even one gem would be worth it.or you, you will likely find a few little gems, so it will be well worth the money you spend on it.   Even one gem would be worth it.

078881172X|1.0|I was totally mislead on this purchase.  I saw no where that it was a VHS.  I was under the impression it was a DVD.  Due to the fact I have no VHS anymore, it has never been used.

B0049OSQ18|5.0|I never really listened to this band before this album but I was intrigued by the ads on IFC's \\"Portlandia.\\" I had always heard they were a \\"prog\\" band so I was kind of initially turned off by the concept of the Decmberists but the snips I heard of this album sounded great.  When I finally heard this in its entirety I really liked it--and after multiple listenings I have come to love it.  What I hear in them among other elements is the inspiration of Richard Thompson era Fairport Convention, especially that earlier band's love of folklore, The Byrds, and The Band.  I then went back to to listen to \\"Hazards of Love\\" which confirms my feelings about this wonderful album.  If \\"Hazards\\" is their \\"Liege and Lief\\" then this is their \\"Shoot Out the Lights.\\"  Witty, timeless, deceptively simple.  I write this in case other people of my age--I am in my 50s--have not listened to this band because they were expecting some pretentious attempt at prog rock.  Yeah, its smart--but it isn't pretentious. Oddly, I didn't like \\"The Crane's Wife\\"--a fine record by the way-- nearly as much as these two later recordings.  On that I heard the band's influences on the surface of the music.  Here their influences are simply inspirations, imho, and they are creating something really exceptional and uniquely there own.

0719079276|4.0|There's no denying that this book is a good, standard, all-encompassing Lit Theory book, especially for British literature studies. It mostly translates well into American Studies, with a few differences in names for some of the theories. The major \\"miss\\" that American teachers wishing to use this book should make a note of is that it lacks any information of African American literature studies. It touches on colonialism, but African American culture and literature is distinct to the US. American Lit Theory/Studies professors should be aware of this, and African American literary theory should be accounted for with supplemental material. Otherwise, the book is reader-friendly and thorough.
B000G0O5N2|5.0|With the great story telling of that fateful day in 1993, what I got out of it is definitely the \\"No Man gets Left Behind\\" message, and conveying home to those that don't believe in the war but follow-up harassing the soldiers in the front line. So much appreciation and admiration to those that not only fought, but keep going back to help until everyone is home.    I'm not in military, nor have any family member affiliated with the military. So I can only judge as someone feel being protected by these brave folks. So this movie was an eye opener - same or more so than Saving Private Ryan.    The blu-ray pictures are pretty good quality for blu-ray standards. Sound effect is quite good as well foot steps and flying bullets can be felt with a good home theater setup.
0307387178|4.0|In Jon Krakauer's riveting account of Chris McCandless's odyssey to find himself, the author does an amazing job in collecting evidence and portraying the life of a young man out to get away from society. Into the Wild is set over the course of three years around the country as Krakauer retraces the steps of McCandless's cross country trek. The year is 1991 and young Chris McCandless, a promising young man, is fed up with the materialistic values that framed both he and his emerging generation. Ever the iconoclast, he graduates from Emory with honors and immediately sets out to find his inner self by living off the land while baptizing himself with a new name, \\"Magic Alex.\\" In response to people who had gone \\"into the wild\\" before him, Chris embarks on the journey of a life time, only to be found dead in the wilds of Alaska in an abandoned bus ten miles from a road along the famed Alaskan Stampede Trail. Krakauer takes you on the life and death adventure of McCandless as he pieces together the fascinating journey of this young man who left behind an invaluable diary that forms the basis of Krakauer's research. The people Chris encounter will never forget this astonishing, idealistic young man, an individual so determined and so focused on his goal that he never left the minds of those he impacted. McCandless was not your ordinary hitchhiker, nearly every person he met on his \\"Great Alaskan Odyssey\\" noticed how noticeably bright this kid was. One man who picked McCandless up on his final journey to Fairbanks, comments to Krakauer, \\"`Alex was clean-shaven and had short hair, and I could tell by the language he used that he was a real sharp fella. He wasn't what you'd call a typical hitchhiker. I'm usually leery of'em. I figure there's probably something wrong with a guy if he can't even afford a bus ticket.'\\" (159). This was what was different about McCandless, he was a smart young man and yet he made some serious blunders in his logic and reasoning. Krakauer did hisresearch on this one as he stitched together a web of first-hand encounters and experiences with Chris McCandless, who was hard to follow as he changed his name every place he went. Many people who read Chris's story call him insane and others call him a purist gone too far. Krakauer makes sure that you can come to your own conclusions on the mental state and reasons for Chris's erratic behavior. I see it as this: a boy turned man fed up with society and trying to get away from it all ventures cross-country and tries to survive off the land in the wilderness of Alaska. I do not believe he is crazy, just enormously driven and focus-oriented; in the end, he wants to live off the land in the wilderness and would not take no for an answer, even if it meant endangering himself. Overall, Jon Krakauer fashions a genuine winner with his remembrance, Into the Wild. The tome combines the information of a news article and autobiography with the interesting and enjoyable reading of a novel. I found this tract to be very interesting and an overall great read. I definitely recommend this book as reading Krakauer's account of a young man out to find himself and break free from the norms of society is interesting and overall it is a great volume that is truly hard to put down.

006029129X|5.0|We have this book checked out from the library and it is the first book my son wants read to him every night.  This set contains 4 different story/adventures of Harold.  I would definitely recommend this book.  My son is 3.5.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Like most Disney films, it's good for the child in all of us, not just for children.  I really like the overall message of the film about teamwork and protecting the environment.  Romance isn't too sappy.  Creative storyline.  I love all the robots and the outer space scenes.  I highly recommend it for your Disney collection.
B001GCUO5M|4.0|Going, going, going, then BAM, veers off in a different direction at the end. Fair to say I didnt have this one figured out. It opens strong with an ominous music score as we first approach the island which sets the chilling tone. Also, the movie really captured the 1950s era feel. Chilling movie.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|I have complained to many publishers about overpriced kindle or ebook editions. It is absolutely insane to charge the same price as a hardcover or paperback.  I refuse to pay these prices.  I just reserved a copy at my local library and will wait for a free copy!  I hope authors are reading our complaints.  At some point I will just stop reading overpriced books all together.  Someone between the author and publisher should take responsibility for the book being overpriced.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|I am a big fan of the Twilight book series, so buying the movies was a natural step.  A movie is hardly ever as good as the book, so it's not surprising that a good bit of the book is not on the screen.  Nevertheless, the screenwriter did an excellent job of capturing the Eclipse world, with Edward even \\"hotter\\" than he was in the first two movies. Jake and Bella are more beautiful, too.  This movie has more action and deeper romance than the first two movies.  There is a lot that is deeper in Eclipse: you see the back stories for the characters Jasper and Rosalie.  You also see some of the horror of vampire life, so this is not a movie for young children.  But it is a must-see for a Twilight fan.    A note on the Special Features commentary:  Robert Pattinson hasn't quite got the knack of commentary.  He is evidently embarrassed by his character, Edward, who is earnest and passionate.  Pattinson's comments are cynical and satiric and tend to ruin the romantic atmosphere, so my advice is not to listen to the commentary until after you have watched the movie several times.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|Yes, the plot isn't all that fresh, but so what.  It's quite funny, and the casting is great.  While I loved all of the characters, I think Mary Louise Parker shines with her loopy, adventure-deprived conversion to mayhem and chaos. If you want dark reality, watch Patriot Games, Day of the Jackal or any other of many.  This one is entertaining and amusing.  Having had an uncomfortably close stint of employment with the secret squirrels in Washington DC, I can assure those who care that the excess of paranoic, law-defying, unquestioning sociopaths and psychopaths in all the various permutations in what is now euphemistically called Homeland Security is far from off the mark.  If the average Joe Citizen had any idea who's supposed to be defending our righteous way of life and what really goes on, he/she would fall on his/her sword.
B0017VG69U|5.0|I was concerned that the remastered version might impact integrity of the original, but I was pleasantly surprised. Loved the home videos!
0374158460|5.0|I don't think that this is meant to be a tale about real life.  It is a story about characters and events that mirror modern America. It is not a perfect novel, but which novel is perfect?  It took me a while to figure out whether the book was a passable literary soap opera, or a masterly piece of modern fiction.  Before I finished it I decided it was the latter.  I judge any piece of art by whether it stays in my mind for weeks afterwards, and seems to echo in experience.  This book did that.  Read it.
B001G70M6S|1.0|I am giving one star because I was told this Fuji instant film would work for a Polaroid 600 camera but it does not. I have not actually used the film to know it's quality because it doesn't fit said camera.
0385341679|5.0|Read the first four fever books from the local library, loved them and decided to buy them. Couldn't wait for this one to come out. Pre-ordered this one, was delivered the day of release and read it in less than 48hrs.did nothing else, but couldn't wait to see how everything tied together. ABSOLUTELY ENJOYED IT. YOU WILL TOO. Thanks Karen Moning.
0140277447|5.0|This was a really good book.  If you like to read about descriptions about atrocities and how people are killed, you will really like it, but if you don't like to read about atrocities, you should not read it.  It can be emotionally painful to read at some parts.
B00140PK6O|5.0|I and my entire family thoroughly enjoyed this sequel to CRANFORD.  It tied up all the loose ends and we all loved it; hated to see it end!  Very, very well-cast; a window on that time in history, and kept us glued to our seats til the end!  It arrived promptly and in excellent condition; great customer service from this supplier, and I would not hesitate to order from them again.
0385341679|3.0|Oh my god. Just finished in like a day and must blurt to someone! So here's the excessive drivel. I liked dreamfever. I thought this book was a little long-winded but there were definitely some what the f moments? If you've been following the series and have been dying to get all your answers answered, you will not be disappointed. Biggest disappointment is who she ended with. Never when gaga over him. Like I was like, too old. Bleh. Worth reading but doesn't up dreamfever.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|Excellent compilation . Opened as a gift yesterday & enjoyed it very much.  She is listening to it on the morning drive to work!
B004IDYK0G|2.0|Loved The Script's first album, was on it while it was still in Europe, getting all my friends and family into it. Saw them touring and was seriously concerned they toured to the point of hurting lead singer Danny's pipes. I have seen them do a lot of bad versions of their songs on TV shows where I thought they should shine. If he hasn't done permanent damage, he is sure risking it, though I know they are pushing hard to get established... Its just that his voice is truly special and I worry that he is doing himself in long-term.    This album is not anywhere near as good as their debut. I see they are now getting b.o.b. to punch up Walk Away, as For the First Time peters out on the charts. That may be necessary, as the other songs on this album are basically throw-aways. I bought the actual CD when it came out overseas and now am frustrated, as well, as only one of the bonus tracks is available to download. I am not re-buying the CD and the only other song I am interested in is not available. My reward for being anxious to get their new CD before it came out in the states is now I have to re-buy the product to get all the songs. The Script told a friend of mine they only sing songs they pen themselves. I fear they have used up all their good stuff on the first album.    Frustrated by the quality of the songs and that I can not download this bonus track by itself...    I hope they take a rest, let Danny's voice come back, and solicit a few songs from quality writers outside the group, so that they can get together a great third album. I like this band a lot, so this was a true disappointment.
B000W74EQC|5.0|They said it was just like new and they were correct.  I have yet to be disapointed when buying an item through Amazon...and we love saving $$$ with them.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I just want to say that I really enjoyed the movie \\"Elena Undone\\" with Necar Zedagan and Traci Dinwiddie. They did an excellent job in the movie and playing their roles. This film blows away all of the lesbian films. Nicole Conn did a great job writing this one as well as directing it. I like lesbian films when they are realistic and not so over the top.
0385341008|5.0|I wanted the letters to continue.  It was wonderful!  Such personalities and wonderful friendships.  It was the friendships that helped them survive.
0307454541|3.0|I decided to read this book based on the hype it was receiving, and that it was being made into a movie.  I found that the book was incredibly hard to get into.  The first 100ish pages were very slow and talked quite a bit about Swedish currency, something that I know little about.<br /><br />Once the book finally picked up and started to formulate a plot I could follow, it ended up being a pretty fun read.  There is quite a bit of very sexually explicit material including rape within the book which I wasn't thrilled about.  Other than that and having a slow beginning, it was a decent book.
0307272702|5.0|Just like \\"Good Calories, Bad Calories,\\" which I read cover to cover in almost one (very long) sitting, this book is life-changing. I was neither overweight nor unhealthy, but since I began applying these principles in my own life I am leaner and healthier. My husband, three children and I have been enjoying wonderful meals filled with healthy fats and good quality protein for two years, and we are all thriving. I would like all my relatives and friends to read this book.  Thank you, Mr. Taubes, for all the great work you have done.
