0800141660|5.0|This is my favorite movie.  I have watched it several times and I always feel like I have learned something new about the characters or story each time. This movie is an emotional rollercoaster.
0307455874|5.0|Written in a style that is easy to read, I found The Audacity of Hope to be very insightful. The author has a simple, but not simplistic, perspective on the world. Since he is our next president, everyone should read this book.
B001BMKOZW|5.0|As we all know, SOAD broke up a couple years ago due to internal tensions within the band. Many fans and, most likely Serj Tankian himself, felt that Daron Malakian was taking too much control over the band. On the Mesmerize/hypnotize records Daron sang quite a bit more than he had before; it didn't bother me and it sure as hell doesn't bother me now.       After listening to this album it's crystal clear who the genius behind SOAD was. Although Serj delivered wonderful vocals, it appears that Daron has the incredible sense of melody and songwriting that made SOAD so great. This album is less metal and more in your face hard rock.              Unlike the choppy sound on SOAD records, Scars On Broadway brings a much more streamlined melodic sound to the table. The songs are extremely catchy; there isn't a single track that I don't like, and it flows together as an album very well.      I was pretty dissapointed with Serj Tankian's solo record because he tried to make a record that sounded exactly like SOAD, but it didn't work; the guitar work was flat and uninspiring and the melody was almost completely gone.       Scars on Broadway is just Daron writing what he wants to and doing an incredible job. Buy this album now!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I had heard a cut or two from the CD and figured that I would like it, but I like it a lot.  It is one of my favorite CD's and I listen to it a lot. You would not be making a mistake ordering this.
B001IDZJFO|5.0|I am a pediatrician who was schooled years ago on the traditional mind maps and felt as I read this excellent summary of clinical and scientific work that there is truly hope on the horizon for those who have had little in the past.   We have done a lot for those with heart ailments including transplantation, which is obviously not the brain's potential, however, with the concept of plasticity of brain and retraining there is something real that can be offered.   The wonderful summaries of the scientific work are done in an inspirational readible format.  I particularly like the way in which the author has personalized the investigators and their dedication to their work.   These gifted men and women have worked in an area that will benefit us all given time, energy and committment.   I would recommend this book to any professional who wants to provide more hope for their patients, as well as to those who want to help themselves and others who may have or may want to provent brain atrophy and replace it with the potential of brain growth at any age.   I particularly like the concept that we can do more with children who have mental or brain diseases.  The future of helping the mind is possible.  Thank you for bringing it to our attention!    Rod Pollary, M.D.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Mamma Mia review.   What a good movie !!   We have always liked musicals and this one did not disappoint.
0743454537|1.0|Like so many other reviewers, I would like to reiterate that this book is wonderful. Jodi weaves a web of conflict that is both beautiful and terrible, where the answers are never right and never wrong. I applaud her for her characters that come to live inside of you, characters you learn to love and hate. When it comes down to it, the book teaches so many lessons about the human condition. I cried a few times and stayed up most of the night trying to get to the end.<br /><br />That being said, the ending was so bad that I want my night back. I wish I had never read this book and would discourage anyone from reading it. The ending to this book is like in a soap opera when they bring dead characters back to life. It's just plain terrible and I will not ruin it for anyone whose curiosity has been piqued by this review.<br /><br />Please, for your own sake though, do not read this book. I say this with the best intentions. You will come to hate the author and I'm sure she has other great books.<br /><br />By the way, it says in an included interview with Picoult at the back of the book that her twelve-year-old son read this book and was crying at the end. He incredulously asked her why it had to end that way. She responded it was the only ending that really made sense. I definitely disagree.
B000EQHHJW|5.0|I love Verdi operas and Rigoletto is one of my favorites.  This production is slightly different but very enjoyable.
0810979772|5.0|I purchased this for my 10 y/o son who adores the writer Jeff Kinney. I am impressed with the way this writer has captivated my son's attention. My son has been reading his books since the 4th grade and we are anticipating the arrival of his latest book due to be released this month. Amazon service was excellent as usual.
B000VNMMR0|4.0|Live Free or Die Hard is the flashiest and most outrageous of the Die Hard series but it has not lost the original candor and humor which makes the older three classic action films. Bruce Willis delivers a great performance that makes you forget his age and he's in terrific shape (if I'm in that good of shape at 50, I'll be perfectly content).<br /><br />Everything in this film is slick and clean, though it requires a healthy suspension of disbelief to enjoy. It is the action film of the nerd, but the old-school cop delivering old-school justice to the villain wins out in the end, like all good Die Hard movies.<br /><br />This movie falls slightly below Die Hard with a Vengeance, but only because Samuel Jackson is not present. The villains are great, and the femme fatale is stunning in every respect.<br /><br />Buy it. Watch it. You won't regret it. If you know and love the old Die Hards, this one will be right up your alley. It's different in tone, less gritty, but still Die Hard.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|One thing I love about Loreena McKennitt is her ability to find old forgotten tunes, make them her own, and bring them to us. She writes melodies that sound as if they have been around for centuries.    Far too many \\"holiday\\" albums nowadays sound alike, in part because they use the same tunes over and over...Frosty, Rudolph, and Santa. We forget that Christmas has been celebrated with music that goes back a long time. We also forget whose birthday we're really celebrating. Loreena remembers both of these facts by bringing old carols from around the world and giving us \\"new\\" songs to celebrate Christmas.
B001IDZJFO|5.0|This book is highly readable and very encouraging. I work in the field of Traumatic Brain Injury and found this book full of powerful knowledge about neuroplasticity. The brain can and does recover from injury and insult. This is wonderful news for all of us!

B001GZ6QDS|5.0|No one can deny the incredible performance of Ledger in this movie, but that shouldn't overshadow the fact that this was the best movie of 2008 period.  It transcends the genre typecasting of \\"comic book\\" movie, and becomes something bigger, better, more mythological.  There was no other movie in 2008 that did this, shook off the shackles of genre pigeon-holing to become something other than it was originally perceived to be.
B000059T00|5.0|The first super band althou that is not realy true,it should be THE CREAM,but with two thirds of Cream,completed with Steve Winwood(Spencer Davies,Traffic)and Rick Grech(Spooky Tooght).Ginger Baker and Eric Clapton are at their best.This is Blues Rock before the term was invented.Even today there are a lot of musicians that count Blind Faith as one of their inspirations.Cranck op the volume and enjoy

0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins and his team did a great job of breaking down both business and leaders into factors that helped make them successful.  Thought Collins markets his book as a business book I believe, like those of Covey, the theories in this book will serve you well in both business and personal aspects of your life.  This book was actually used as a text in my MBA studies at Fairleigh Dickinson University's Silberman College of Buisness, a nationally top ranking entrepreneurship school.  As such I've engaged in many hours of discussion with both students and seasoned professionals about the merits and short-comings of this book.    First, I'll start with where it comes up short since everyone loves that and I'd prefer to finish on a positive note anyway.  Some people feel that Collins's findings just aren't possible to implement in real world work environments.  Others argue that most of this material just doesn't apply to anyone that's not a senior executive in the organization.  Last, and my favorite, is the rational that success, especially in these companies, is random and luck based.  I contend they're all wrong, and I'll tell you why.  The only criticism of this book I do accept is Collins's criteria for a successful company is purely financial, which I don't agree with, but he does address hi s reasoning right at the beginning.  I understand why he had to do it, but I still don't agree with it.    To those who argue Collins' methods are not implementable in the real world I say quit arguing the metaphors and learn from the principles.  Try not to get stuck duplicating the examples Collins uses in the book, they are just examples.  Read between the lines and just pull out what he's trying to say... \\"first who...\\", \\"The Hedgehog Concept\\", \\"The Flywheel\\", and, if you have the audiobook, pay close attention to the student question in the epilogue.  These are simple concepts that can have a great impact on you, your organization, and your career.  I contend that eachand every one of the theories in this book can be implemented in business at all levels, not just at the top, as well as everyday life.  I believe you can be a level five leader in life, not just in business.  The book \\"Leadership and Self-Deception\\" by The Arbinger Institute is a great book to emphasize this point.     And finally, for anyone that feels success is random and/or we can't break it down into a set of rules or principles I'd recommend reading Taleb's \\"The Black Swan\\", (a great book btw) which might make you feel better about yourself.  I'd also recommend \\"Outliers\\" by Gladwell, another book which does in-depth research into success.  Look specifically at the 10,000 hour rule and see how well it fits with Collins's Flywheel concept.    Now for the pros of this book.  There are too many to list.  Collins's principles of level five leadership, the fly wheel, the doom loop, build-up to break-through, etc., etc., and so on, and so on are all very good points.  Again, these principles don't just apply to business, they also apply to life.  I'm currently a technology marketing professional, but not a sr. executive.  Build-up to break-through and the flywheel concept are just two great ways I've made a difference in my organization from the bottom up.  I'm also an entrepreneur and own my own business and one of the best things I found about Good To Great was The Hedgehog concept and how it applies to Gladwell's 10,000 hour rule.  Overall a good read with great theories.    As always the metaphors and examples can be argued until you're blue in the face, but if you attempt to do that then you've already missed the point.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|My wife is a fan and while I can't say that I am a \\"fan\\" per se, it is a very good album and the guy is really talented. Well worth buying.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie was delivered fast and according the the product description. Well worth the cost especially if your a batman fan.

B000I5X81A|5.0|Having spent a great amount of time listening to Mr. Cale's work I believe there's a certain timeless quality to it - its never obstrusive yet always engaging and ultimately, great fun.  I felt some of that on the material on this record.  For that alone, I recommend giving this disc a chance even if Clapton's tightness sometimes gets in the way.<br /><br />I strongly recommend Cale's solo work for its pureness and authenticity.  The word \\"joy\\" only begins to describe the experience.
B0018CWEYY|2.0|You could really tell there was a writers strike going on~~the storyline was scattered and this was made worse by the fact that there were only 15 episodes on this long awaited for 6 disc collection.  Why did it take until December to receive this when the first 3 seasons were avalable in September and they had more episodes?  Was it because they needed filler?  These problems along with no reduction in price made LOST the 4th season a disappointment. We will probably rent season 5 instead of buying unless we can get more bang for our buck.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|Amazing documentary - not so much for the filming, which is rather amateurish, but for the capturing of the spirit of an extraordinary individual.  One man soaring above the dominance of the physical structures, almost angelic compared to the demons who could only destroy them 27 years later.
1416595546|5.0|For the six decades since the end of World War II, the fight against Nazism has been the backdrop for countless novels. Russia under the Communists was just as evil but has failed to evoke anywhere near the same level of interest. Simon Montefiore has taken a small step in bridging the gap with Sashenka, the story of a upper-class Russian girl who becomes a dedicated Marxist and revolutionary only to find that she and her family cannot themselves escape Stalin's terror. I couldn't put the book down.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|The kids love Kung Fu Panda, that's all they want to watch while in the car.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is really a fun movie.  My family watches it once a year and it's funny each time we watch it.  I highly recommend it as a \\"pick me up\\".  Many times Christmas is a sad time for some and if you watch this movie, you'll laugh.  It's a \\"must\\" for the holidays.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Once you start watching this series, which contains ten 55 minute episodes on three discs, you're tempted to watch the entire series in one sitting.  At our house, we did it in two nights.   I purchased an additional set as a Christmas gift and it was well received.  Henry VIII was a son-of-a-gun and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers does an outstanding job proving that. As a matter of fact, the entire cast does a fabulous job.  Can't wait to watch Season 2 and 3.
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We've owned this movie in other formats since it came out many years ago, and still enjoy watching it!  The detail of the Blu-ray version brings to life all over again.  Well worth the money.
1416562605|4.0|The novel was very well done, which is why it won a prize.  The notion of enterprenuership in a country as disorganized as India is intriguing, and the lengths to which the narrator has to go to be successful are extreme.  The characters are flat, but the message  Adiga wants to convey is the rage of the common man in India.  well done.
0517687801|5.0|Charles Dickens was formulative in the creation of the image of an Old Fashioned Christmas for our culture and  \\"The Christmas Carol\\" was instrumental in that movement.  It is second only to the Gospel in Christmas literature.  But there are many points that we tend to gloss over because we don't live in either England, or in the Victorian culture.  The \\"Annotated Christmas Carol\\" is a gem because it explains many of the points that we miss -- the significance of much of the symbolism, especially during the Ghost of Christmas Present's visit. What is Brawn, for example?  This is a fascinating addition for those who love this wonderful story.
B000WM725C|4.0|If, like I was, you're concerned about purchasing \\"Live Rust\\" again but in different packaging, you're partially correct.  You can go to \\"neilyoung.com\\", click on \\"Archives\\", then \\"Discography 1\\" and finally \\"Live Rust\\" and discover that half of the songs were performed at the Cow Palace in San Francisco on 10/22/78.  The remaining 8 were performed during the same incredible tour but in 4 different cities between October 4th and the 19th.  \\"Thrasher\\" (in which he temporarily forgets the lyrics) and \\"Welfare Mothers\\" are excluded from \\"Live Rust\\".  It's also worth it for me to have the other 8 songs performed at the Cow Palace that were performed in different cities on \\"Live Rust\\".  The packaging is great and the sound quality is good.  A must, in my opinion, for any Young fan.  It's too bad we couldn't buy the 10 songs individually and exclude the 8 already on \\"Live Rust\\".

B001KVZ6BG|4.0|The camera pans the white monoliths baking in the glaring Indian sun as Jamal's street smart brother Salim waves his hand towards the burgeoning panorama of construction concrete and dust and in a manner of introduction (he has not seen his sibling for years) explains that the site of this savvy new business park in Mumbai's boomtown of finance and commerce once contained the unbelievable (from a Western stance) dichotomy of vibrant patchwork color and dingy garbage-fill filth that like a Bizarro-World sunburnt vision of Legoland constructs the mire mosaic slum in which the Brothers Malik were born.<br /><br />In director Danny Boyle's 2008 film \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" one gets the impression that as the apprehensive Jamal, the child-to-teenage protagonist, struggles to emerge as a viable force with which to be reckoned in his own right--he consistently overcomes one trial of urban treachery after another as all the mythic heroes from Hercules, Jason and Krishna do, literally rising from a sludge of excrement in a moment of quasi-lightness as he imperturbably pursues a coveted autograph from a Bollywood actor helicoptered into the capital amidst a scattershot of plastic and cardboard garbage fluttering as innocuously as autumn leaves--so does modern day India strive to reinvent itself, wishing to shed its reputation of over population and poverty with the apparent ease of a bulldozer flattening acres of slum dwellings to reveal a real-time optical illusion of power and prosperity shimmering with the promise of world-class commercial status after the dust settles.<br /><br />Whether or not Boyle had this analogy in mind, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" fascinates with its vivid depiction of a transitional India in a twist on the typical rag-to-riches storyline where grossly-over-populated-slum boy makes good and, of course, gets the girl of his dreams. Jamal, a chai-wallah (tea maestro) for a large telecommunications firm inadvertently finds himself on India's version of \\"Who Wants to Be a Millionaire\\" complete with smarmy jokes and a slick Bollywood version of Regis Philbin. Unlucky Slumdog, with just one question to go to win 20 million rupees, is arrested for cheating and spends most of the film's running time in the police station explaining through life-lesson rather than lifeline vignettes just how he knows the answers to questions that have stumped far more educated contestants. Through the devise of flashback, the audience cringes as Jamal and his older brother Salim played initially by younger child actors, watch their mother murdered by a marauding group of Muslim-hating crazies and as orphans fend in a horrific stomach-churning world of harsh endurance that seems more hellish than anything Dante could imagine.  Somehow they survive some downright disturbing almost vomit-inducing entrapments escaping from personifications of evil that Dickens would have loved to make you hate.  On average Boyle dishes up an extra huge serving of fraternal devotion with zings as tangy as an expertly concocted chutney as the brothers and Jamal's love interest, Latika, barrel through the underbelly of their country undergoing two other actor reincarnations before the final denouement revolving around the television game show studio hot seat.<br /><br />Bottom Line?  \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" gruesomely depicts an India that few would want to visit.  Set in Mumbai's Dharavi slum, the otherwise could-be predictability of the boy-meets-girl, boy-conquers-adversity formula escapist fare takes on the additional nuance of the travelogue, introducing the viewer beyond the Pillars of Hercules to an unfamiliar world where dragons lie and commerce wants to reign.

1582701709|5.0|I would recommend to anyone that you purchase this book. I have not finished it but everything in it makes complete sense. They also connect the Bible in all areas which is wonderful. It makes a difference in your life if you read it.
1598561634|3.0|There may be another Hebrew Bible available than this one, but I am not aware of it; I know that there is a wide-margin edition that has come out recently, but the font-size remains the same as in the narrow-margin version I have.  The marginalia are in what looks like about 6-point!!  Considering that the diacritical marks for the consonants are already themselves sometimes difficult to identify without getting the book a half-inch from your face, a magnifying glass would be an excellent investment when purchasing this book.  Other than that criticism, this is a beautiful book and it is a beautiful thing to be able to read these biblical books in Hebrew.
B001BYBAQC|5.0|Fleet Foxes is my favorite new band of the last couple years.  Their debut self-titled album is a hook-laden masterpiece of arrangements and harmony.  Fleet Foxes manage to blend genres of pop and Americana with indie rock sensibilities, and a unique melodic algorithm that is enchanting.  My sister first turned me on to Fleet Foxes, describing them as \\"The Shins had sex with My Morning Jacket at a Renaissance fair.\\"  I would probably throw in some Nick Drake and Beach Boys for good measure, but pretty close.  If you haven't listened to this, you should definitely try to get an earful of \\"White Winter Hymnal\\" and \\"Ragged Wood\\".  You will become a believer.

0765316897|5.0|What can I say that already hasn't been said. Just a thoroughly satisfying trilogy.  One of the   best (mini-epic) series I've ever read.               For those who complain  about more character dialogue and development, it's only a 3 book series!  Get   real! You are suffering from Jordan or Goodkind syndrome. You can't cram a bunch of stuffy dialogue into   a short series like this. I personally thought it struck a good balance of character development with plot and   action.         This is the problem  that R. Jordan eventually ran into in the Wheel of time series. Exhaustive over   verbiage and not enough action and plot completion. Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of   time as well.  The Mistborn series is a wonderful breath of fresh air.       Religion complaints        For those who complained about the alleged religious connotations or agenda of the author offer no real   logical explanation for there feelings. Religion has been a part of our world for thousands of years. So it   should be no surprise it would find it's way into fantasy or other works of fiction.  More often then not I   find those who make these complaints have some anti-religious axe to grind. Yet, they are hypocrites.     EVERYONE is religious. Religion is a world view. Even if you don't believe in God, that is \\"your\\"    religious world view and you operate your life according to that world view just like a person of theistic   faith operates according his worldview.  So spare us the anti-religious bigotry in the reviews.

031606792X|5.0|I, for one, cannot complain about the happy ending that disappointed the other readers. Ms. Meyer set up a fantastic plot over the course of the first three books, developed that plot and her characters more fully than I ever expected in the fourth, and - yes - it is a fairy tale.  A modern-day fairy-tale intricately woven in legend and fantasy.  Enough suffering takes place in this series - real life suffering to which any ordinary human can relate, not the least of which is that brought on by undeniable love for another who is, for whatever reason, unavailable.  The final installment rewards with the reader with intrigue and then resolution.  I didn't want it to end, but if it had to, I'm happy with the ending.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is a must have for everyone. The series is informative, beautifully done, and captures some of the most amazing footage ever. Each hour long episode is as interesting as it is informative and visually captivating. I would recommend this for anyone, and it makes a great gift.    One note about the version. You will want to get the BBC version narrated by David Attenborough, as it is much, much better than the American version narrated by Sigourney Weaver.
B000EUDAWG|5.0|Tara the Tarantula provided loads of fun for my husband, who is an entomologist. Seems to be anatomically correct too! My cat, who is too sophisticated to play with most toys, suckered for it too -- at first recoiling, then chasing it!

B001GZ6QC4|4.0|What! Where are the Special Features? This DVD should have been packed with interviews, deleted scenes, how the special effects were done, etc.  I loved the movie (I've seen it 8 times) but was so looking forward to the DVD's special features.  What a let down!
B000002J0N|5.0|The story of how David Crosby and Stephen Stills, jamming in a house in Laurel Canyon, were asked by Graham Nash to repeat 'Helplessly Hoping' enough times for Nash to come up with a perfect high tenor part has been told quite often.  The generalization that their personalities did not always blend as well as their voices once the honeymoon was over is a given.  The first album, CROSBY, STILLS & NASH, deserves its niche in rock music history.  And fans of the trio can go on and on...<br /><br />But this is a review of CSN.  It's at least as good as the first album, and besides, the cover photo shows them in the proper order this time!  Remember when 'Just a Song Before I Go' first got radio airplay?  The wonderful, unmistakeable sound of those three voices delivering catchy, fresh material worked magic again.  Our heroes, more than out of a slump, seemed to have worked out a few of their problems.  Highlights of their updated sound:  the cool jazz of Crosby's disarming 'Anything at All', tight harmonies in Stills' 'Run From Tears' and more versatility in general on the part of Nash, whose beautiful 'Cold Rain' grows on you as much as 'Cathedral' can bowl one over.  Lightning has struck twice, but CSN are in a different place, and look how far they had to go to get there!<br /><br />Take both discs mentioned here to that desert island and turn 'em up.
B0007TKNCY|5.0|This is one of my favorite classics and certainly one of my favorite Katherine Hepburn movies.  I don't understand why it did not do better in ratings when it was in theatres.  Katherine Hepburn is the funniest ditzy heiress ever and the movie has a nice quick pace.  My kids even enjoyed it.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|These bluesy, jazzy songs attracted me in the movie \\"Venus\\". Very soulful. The CD was a favorite of the director's daughter. He originally chose one of Corinne's song but ended up using her music for most of the film. I ordered the CD from Amazon and I play it all the time - a first for years!

B00005JLKB|4.0|Season Review-    After over 70 years, Superman has become more than just a pop culture phenomenon, but an international success and an iconic symbol that still holds strong even today. From his first appearance on Action Comics in 1938 to George Reeves's live action series of the 50s to the stunning Richard Donnor films of the 70s and 80s to the romantic action comedy of Lois and Clark in the 90s as well as the animated adventures, Superman has been successful in all media. The story and journey of the Last Son of Krypton has become an American classic and no superhero has been more successful than the Man of Steel. In the fall of 2001, The WB went on to debut the latest and probably most refreshing tale of Superman yet with \\"Smallville\\". Created by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, \\"Smallville\\" would tell the journey of a young Clark Kent before he would put on his signature tights. With an intriguing premise, a stunning looking cast and a good budget to back up its storylines, \\"Smallville\\" premiered with the highest ratings the small network has ever had, a whopping 8.4 million viewers tuned in to see the pilot episode simply titled, \\"Pilot.\\" \\"Pilot\\" is such an impressive introduction to the series that still remains strong `til this day. The ingenious idea that not just has baby Kal-El arrive on Earth in his spaceship, but with a meteor shower caused by the destruction of Krypton was the perfect set-up for the rest of the series.     The cast all fit their roles and do a fine job when interacting for the first time. A then 24 year-old Tom Welling is very convincing as the whiny, moody, mild mannered 15 year-old Clark Kent. You really feel bad as he just wants to be normal, yet his extraordinary abilities make it even harder for him to be a teenager. John Schneider (Dukes of Hazard) and Annette 'O Toole (Lana Lang in Superman III, ironically) are just perfect as Clark's loving adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent. Sam Jones III is fine as Clark's energetic best friend, Pete Ross and Allison Mack is lovely as Chloe Sullivan (who besides Lionel Luthor is the only other character not from the mythos, but an original character). Then you have a very innocent yet cute Kristin Kruek as Lana Lang, Clark's high school sweetheart and Eric Johnson as Whitney Fordman, Lana's boyfriend. The last of the cast is the excellent John Glover as Lionel Luthor and Michael Rosenbaum as a young Lex Luthor. Probably the other impressive aspect of the first episode is how Clark and Lex first meet, which involves Lex running Clark over on the road and Clark saving his life. After that traumatic event, both men become friends! Wait, the future Superman and Lex Luthor friends? That premise alone already made \\"Smallville\\" much more unique than any other Superman adaption before it.    Season 1 is mostly about Clark dealing with the discovery that his an alien as well as developing into Smallville's unlikely hero when meteor freaks (humans infected by the meteor rocks of the meteor showers) begin terrorizing the town with their unique powers. \\"Metamorphosis\\" sees Clark battling a boy with insect abilities, \\"Hothead\\" features a football coach with fire manipulation, and \\"Cool\\" has a meteor freak with a Mr. Freeze-type ability that sets his sights on Chloe. The meteor freak of the week type storylines are both the season's strength and weakest. Some are excellent (\\"X-Ray\\", which Clark discovers his X-Ray vision) while some are plain sub-par (\\"Reaper\\", a mess of an episode where a meteor freak can literally turn people into ash.) But while Season 1 has its jittery and not so pleasant moments, the character development and growing relationship easily shine through. Episodes like \\"Leech\\" already shows exactly why Clark will grow up to be the greatest hero of all time, \\"Zero\\" is a nice introduction into the dark world of Lex's past and \\"Rogue\\" tests the bond of the Kent family when a renegade cop sets his sights on Clark. Other memorable from this series'freshman year is \\"Jitters\\" with Tony Todd's unforgettable guest appearance, the mysterious invisible killer storyline of \\"Shimmer\\", and the suspense driven finale, \\"Tempest\\" with tension filled cliffhangers which one that sees Lana's life hanging in the balance when tornados hit Smallville.    It's funny looking back at the first season, seeing as how everything was so innocent and grounded back then. Clark and Lana's growing friendship with hidden signs of romance was great to watch, who would have thought it would have been dragged out for the next 6 seasons. Also, Clark and Lex's friendship was at its prime with no signs of animosity but genuine brotherly love for one another. Season 1 is a solid first season with great introduction, memorable character development and a lot of signs of promise for the rest of the series.    Season Rating: 8/10    Video and Audio review-    All 21 episodes in the first season are shown in widescreen which fits the series.  The episodes look nice with vibrant colors and the audio is just fine, although nothing special.    Video and Audio: 7/10    Extras:    The first season box set has some pretty average; you have 2 commentaries for \\"Pilot\\" and \\"Metamorphosis\\" with the show creators which are just okay.  The Storyboard extra is decent but unnecessary look as making the \\"Pilot\\" episode. The Interactive Smallville extra is pretty boring and the 2 WB spots are a cool look back at the old WB promos.      Extras Rating: 5/10    Overall Score: 7.5/10
B0018PH3L0|5.0|GREAT MOVIE IN ITSELF BUT EVEN BETTER FOR A STORMY RAINY DAY.GREAT SERVICE IN GETTING THE MOVIE ALSO
B0013FSL3E|2.0|I like Pixar. I think they consistently make good movies--good in terms of narration, character building, and animation. The Incredibles is one of my favorite movies, and I thoroughly enjoyed Finding Nemo and Toy Story 2. I wanted to like Wall-E and I waited to be blown away.<br /><br />Now even I think that the Pixar hype has gone to a silly level. This movie is NOT the best movie of 2008. It's not the best of anything, with the exception of its animation--which does not, can not, make a movie succeed all on its own. In fact, what this movie ultimately reminded me of was a Pixar television special that was about 68 minutes too long. Wall-E's biggest problem is that it was overwrought.<br /><br />The basic plot is that humankind has \\"made too much trash\\" (killed the Earth with their blasted industry and consumerism, those cads) and has blasted off into space to hang out on a spaceship, teeing off and drinking slushies. Meanwhile, down on Earth, little Wall-E units work hard every day to clean up the trash. Let's zoom through 700 years to the present day. That's when we meet our intrepid hero, an adorable Wall-E robot--arguably, the last of his kind. Apparently, he's been working for centuries (one of several \\"um, what?\\" moments), fixing himself with spare parts. Over the centuries, he has developed individuality and a personality; he is friends with an adorable cockroach and collects interesting junk in a trailer. He happens to meet a probe called \\"Eve\\" who has been sent to Earth by the star-bound humans for a secret purpose. He falls in love with her. They have an adventure. Will Eve return his affection by the end?<br /><br />So is there more than that? Well, uh, technically... no. It's a love story between two robots and yet another preachy narrative about how terrible humans are at taking care of the environment. Oh, Wall-E is cute and instantly lovable, absolutely. The intermittent slapstick is laugh out loud, and the animation glitters. The problem is that it's an incredibly basic story with incredibly basic characters and yet another obnoxious \\"save the environment!\\" theme. I was bored out of my mind most of the time.<br /><br />What Wall-E really reminds me of is Studio Ghibli films, which I suppose shouldn't be a surprise, thanks to Mr. Lasater's closeness with Hayao Miyazaki. There's a quiet, understated, delicious kind of optimism about Ghibli films--most characters are inherently good and cheerful, and everyday life is infused with magic. Wall-E attempts to capture this same pleasant spirit and fails miserably, veering into hateful saccharine territory instead.<br /><br />The problem is that the characters in Wall-E have been dumbed down. Whereas Ghibli's characters generally tend to be complex and flawed--heck, just as the characters of The Incredibles and Finding Nemo were complex and flawed--Wall-E's characters seem just... stupid. Obnoxiously stupid, obnoxiously one-sided, optimistic only because they are incapable of feeling anything else. When human beings of the future see Wall-E--this filthy, antiquated little machine--they show no surprise at him and ask no questions about his appearance or why he's there. Wall-E simply bumbles from one mishap to another, unwittingly teaching little \\"life lessons\\" (ugh) to random people and robots, none of whom seem capable of thinking on their own. It's like a series of bubbly Pixar shorts, plot be darned. Heck, there is only one \\"villain\\" to surmount--and it's not a particularly impressive one!<br /><br />Add to this some heinous dialogue (\\"Get ready to have some kids!\\") and some very blah character designs for the humans (all of the fatties look alike, even those of different races... whatever happened to the fantastic character designs in previous Pixar films?), and you have a very bland movie indeed.<br /><br />Am I really supposed to believe that human beings don't ask questions in the future and that they lose all of their intelligence? That consumerism blinds themall and that they all turn into miniature Jabba the Hutts? Yes, I know it's supposed to be a light-hearted judgment at Americans and consumerism in general. How very cutting-edge of them! This has only been the judgment thrown at Americans for at least twenty years.<br /><br />My favorite silly moment in this very short-sighted movie is the future portraying the humans' return to Earth, which is shown during the credits. A utopia featuring a green and flourishing Earth is seen. Humans are seen fishing with the help of robots, farming, etc... but no factories building said robots are shown, no energy sources for the robots, no houses for the people. Is Pixar serious? With technology comes waste. Heck, with human life comes waste. So it has been ever since the first human set foot on this Earth, so it will ever be. Anyone showing otherwise is painfully short-sighted and ignorant.<br /><br />Enough of this mindless eco-babble already! We all want and need nature and we need to take care of it, but we all want luxuries and need technology, too. There should be a happy medium; there probably never will be. Hey, I have an idea to chew on--where would Pixar be without the trucks and planes shipping its movies to movie theaters all over the world? Or the cars and SUVs that its animators drive to work every day? Or the movie-goers who drove to theaters to watch Wall-E, the trucks that delivered that popcorn they so blithely bought? This is arm-chair preaching. It will affect nothing. It only feeds into the same well-oiled machine it hypocritically decries.<br /><br />Here's another thought. Who did they make this movie for? If it's for kids, it's too long and boring for them. If it's for adults, it's too simple. Commercials seemed made to appeal to the younger crowd, which was misleading. I'm honestly shocked people DO like it to such an incredible degree.<br /><br />All this movie is is a heavy-handed morality tale related in a series of frustrating Pixar shorts, headed bya cute little robot who simply can't carry the weight of it. Some movies, like Ghibli films mentioned beforehand, manage to teach these themes without effort. After watching My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away, you want to see pristine forests; you want to make sure the rivers are clean. My Neighbor Totoro inspired the Japanese to set aside a special reserve of pristine forests and it didn't have to beat anyone over the head with Captain Planet theology to do it.<br /><br />I don't need or want lots of action or explosions or shiny things. All the Ghibli films I've seen and enjoyed do not rely on heavy-handed plots, for example; they rely on delicate, delicious character development. That's why most of them succeed where Wall-E fails; Wall-E is just not that complex. It offers nothing that hasn't been seen before. It goes from point A to point B to point C, character unchanging, simply adorable -- as though cuteness and slapstick could carry a 98-minute long movie!<br /><br />I hope Pixar moves forward and makes something a little more substantial next time, hopefully with the deep characterization I loved in Finding Nemo and The Incredibles.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|This is the best Batman ever. It's the way the Batman movies should have been made. Christian Bale blew Michael Keaton out of the water as Batman. Much better than Batman Begins. It is more in line with the comic book. Plus there are no more cheesy lines or stupid villians. Heath Ledger killed as the Joker. He really got into the role that he became the Joker.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|I loved Batman Begins. It was fun, with wonderful characterization, cool Bat gadgets, and fun bad guys. A thrilling run from start to finish, and most certainly a movie I hope to someday own. So, needless to say, I couldn't wait to see The Dark Knight.    I quickly discovered that The Dark Knight does not have the same spirit as Batman Begins. It is not a fun movie; it is a dark, \\"heavy\\" movie. Heavy themes, heavy thoughts, enough depth to drown in, carried by excellent actors and sharp dialogue and deep ethical questions. That's great. I usually look forward to movies like this -- movies coupling art with entertainment, one of the highest callings entertainment can aspire to and one of the hardest to achieve.    That said, this is the only movie that I could not say simply, \\"I liked it\\" or \\"I hated it\\" after watching it. I simply felt drained after watching it, like I had just sprinted down a steep road for 2 1/2 hours and hit a wall face-first at the bottom. I thought that perhaps after a few days I'd figure out whether it was my thing or not. At the end, no. It's not my kind of movie. I must add one thought to this: I could also not say it's a bad movie by any means. In fact, in some ways, rating it below 5 stars is a crime.    There's great acting here by everyone, even secondary and tertiary characters. Batman does have some unintentionally humorous moments with his rasping, slurring \\"bat-voice\\" -- sometimes you can't tell what he says, and it borders on over-acting -- but overall, he does a fine job. The Joker is downright perfect (perhaps a little too perfect) -- a character you'll love to hate.    The characters are great, the plot is excellently crafted, and the dialogue is great. It's not just solid, it's a masterpiece.    But do not be fooled by the title of this movie. This is the Joker's film from beginning to end. In fact, that's my main complaint. Where's Batman? Why is everyone so powerless in Joker's schemes? Why is Batman such a failure? Joker is apsychic; everything goes according to his plans, and I mean everything. He foresees every movement, every feint, and every plot. After a while, this gets very, very silly. As another reviewer so aptly stated, when he DOES get proven wrong, it seems more contrived than anything else -- merely a way to end the movie. The Joker gets more screen time than anyone else; Batman and all the other champions of Gotham City fail time and time again before his onslaught.    Because of this constant struggle, with the \\"good side\\" never giving up and often so close to victory, the tension never drops for a second. Every moment the Joker is alive is a moment you can't relax. It's like a nightmare that never ends -- every time you think there will be a moment of brightness, the Joker backhands it and everything falls black again. It's tiresome. No, you can't stop watching it, but it's terribly draining and depressing.    Harvey Dent is another con for me. He is Two-Face for such a short time that he doesn't deserve the moniker. That wasn't Two-Face; that was just a scarred up guy who killed, what, two people? Not scary, not very impressive, not worth a \\"super villain\\" title.    Pacing is yet another con for me. As I stated before, it is constant, draining tension from start to finish. There's not a single moment of reprieve, not one -- false starts, sometimes, but never truly a moment to breathe. And there's almost never a positive moment to be had!    In the end, this isn't entertainment. This is an experience and an exploration of the natures of good and evil. What I wanted, and thought I was going to see, was a fun ride with an uplifting end; what I received was a riveting, dark thriller that essentially states that evil is all-pervasive and nigh insurmountable. Even with the Joker captured, one has the sensation that he has won anyway -- every second he is alive, he wins. Indeed, according to The Dark Knight, there is no good -- only different kinds and different \\"strengths\\" of evil.    In the end, The Dark Knight just not my kind of thing -- not for its lack of quality, and not because I deny the fact that \\"evil's\\" successes are more prevalent than \\"good's\\" -- but because I go to the movies to see evil smacked in the head at the end. I want to see something work for once. I want to see good triumph; I want to think there IS such a thing as good. I wanted Batman to win completely, without question.    This is certainly no feel good movie; it has most certainly raised the bar for super-hero movies. There are more philosophical and ethical questions to ponder here than in many of the dullest art movies. However, I do hope that in the inevitable sequel, there are a few more bright points and positively charged thrills... and more of the Batman himself.
1401308201|5.0|It's great for anyone who loved the magic of the play. It has all the information about how the Broadway original was created. It is a spoiler for those people who haven't seen the play though. It has amazing pictures from the original Broadway production. Plus lyrics from the songs and dialogue from the acts. Plus extras. Everything all in one book.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I was very impressed with this HBO series. I'm a history buff anyway and love anything related to the early history of our Country.  I thought this was a well produced, well thought out miniseries and I would recommend it very highly.  I learned alot about John Adams and his relationship with other founding fathers.  Once you get past the first scene of the movie where you can't really see anything because its filmed in the dark, it improves from that point on.
B000K8IDF6|5.0|This is one the Rolling Stones best albums.  The song \\"Dead Flowers\\" doesn't appear on any other albums that I know of. This album was produced during the height of the Stones popularity.  It will not dissappoint you.
630170648X|5.0|This classic film of the 30's was ahead of its time, considering that Poland would be invaded by the Germans -- the concept has a seriocomic take on what the Poles had to do when their country got invaded.  This VHS package was a delightful surprise and thank the vendor for sharing!  Thanks
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I was not going to write a review since so much has been said about this series, but felt something this good deserved even another review of praise.<br /><br />My daughter and I started watching this series on DVD in August of 2007.  We rented them and were only able to get one disc at time which left us in a constant state of aggitation while waiting for the next one to arrive in the mail.  We quickly decided that wasn't workig out well so we borrowed the first 4 seasons from her best friend.  Pretty quickly we realized that was going to be a problem so when the complete series was coming out, I pre-ordered it.  What a wonderful value !!!<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about the show.  My daughter (now age 14), my husband (age 51) and I (somewhere older than 35) all think it's one of the best things ever.  We have watched them as a family and it's definitely not chick-lit for television.  The writing is so fast-paced and witty with hilarious characters -- this series is for anyone who wants to think versus being given crude humor for a laugh.  We have watched the entire series twice and my daughter has started through it again for the third time.  Even with that much viewing, we still enjoy it and it's not stale.<br /><br />Wonderful, wonderful series.<br /><br />Warning to those with young daughters wanting to see it: This series does have some mature material in it.  Nothing usually very explicit, but the whole story is around the main character who had a baby at 16.  My daughter and I have been able to have some excellent discussions about choices and consequences after viewing this and age 13 and above are fine in my opinion.  Much younger than than, and I think I would not have allowed her to watch until she was older.
B0014Z4P6U|3.0|Children of Men is a surprisingly well done movie, with good set design, a good script, good acting, and high production values.  It is a cinematic gem whose reputation is likely to grow over time.    That is all I will say about the movie itself, because the primary purpose of this particular review is more limited:  to let people know about the Blu Ray that Amazon sent me.    I received a Scandinavian import.  While the quality of the picture was good, the opening screen was simply for the viewer to choose which of four languages (Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and Finnish) the subtitles would be in (luckily it was not dubbed but was in English).  There were no extras that I could find, so it is truly a bare bones Blu Ray.  As a result,  I was disappointed with the Blu-Ray even though I like the movie itself very well.  Caveat emptor, folks.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|The Dark Knight was truly a wonderful movie! My husband and I have become very selective on which DVDs we purchase for our library--this movie was an obvious winner! I, and I know many others, are sad about the fact that we won't be able to experience Heath Ledger's involvement in future movies.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|In \\"Big Lebowski\\" (1998) -a weird, nutty, outrageously funny and deliciously twisted movie, the brothers Ethan and Joel Coens, known for their unique dry and more often than not dark humor, sit back, laugh out loud, and have fun. Big Lebowski is IMO one of the top funniest comedies ever made. It is funny because of the incredibly off-beat characters, their weirdness, flaws, their interaction, the surreal situations they found themselves in, and perfectly written and delivered hilarious dialogs. There is the story of course which is based on the case of mistaken identity with the following kidnapping, villainous nihilists, vanguard erotic flying painter, the bowler named Jesus, etc but the story is truly secondary to the beautiful craziness of the movie. I've read many reviews that call Big Lebowski a mess, saying that the story is convoluted, call it misfire and deranged, with the characters we would not care about a bit. It was also interesting to read the reviews that were written upon its release and compared it to Coens' \\"Fargo\\" that had been made a year earlier than the adventure of Jeffrey \\"the Dude\\" Lebowski. I agree that \\"Fargo\\" is Coens' masterwork but it does not make BL any worse. It was dismissed as the inferior film and was predicted not to stand the future re-watch. How wrong the prediction was. \\"The Dude\\" Lebowski - middle-aged pot smoking, White Russian drinking, bowling enthusiast -ex hippie and his friends, Polish Catholic converted Jew, more Jewish than Tevye Viet Nam veteran Walter with anger management problems (John Goodman) and timid, little slow, \\"sweet prince\\" Donnie (unusually quiet Steve Buscemi) have become the cult figures, the beloved characters, even more than just the characters for millions of film lovers of different generations, not only the baby boomers. Our younger son came home for Christmas holidays couple of weeks ago, and we were talking about and quoting BL, one of his all time favorite movies in our conversations - we always do. He gave me the DVD couple of years ago for my birthday, and the movie has become one of my favorite comedies since that time, too. Ironically, I did not like it much after the first viewing ten years ago. It seemed too surreal, loud, and strange. Now it is different - I can't get enough of it. While our son was visiting, Big Lebowski was shown on TV in the beautiful crisp HD presentation. Once again, I laughed so much and so hard that I was afraid to ruin my rug which really ties the room together in the same manner Dude's was. Great and immortal fun, THE cult picture for as long as people watch movies.<br /><br />While writing about Big Lebowski, I looked up the Coens' resume. They've made only 13 films, and all of them are treasures, including their contribution in the 2006 anthology, Paris, je t'aime (2006). I've seen all their films and I want to repeat the title of my review on their latest, \\"Burn after reading\\" - Brother Coen don't make bad movies, they don't know how. Their films should not be missed - they all are clever, darkly funny, and beautiful without being pretty pictures, in short, first class entertainment. There are only two working directors whose movies I always see upon release in the theater, preferably, during the first weekend - Woody Allen and the writing/directing team, Ethan and Joel Coen.s do.

0689853491|2.0|I never grew up with this song but got the book since it had such great reviews.  Well, the drawings are lovely and I can understand the interest in the sounds used but all in all, my daughter and I never found a good rhythm with this book's words/lyrics since we did not know the song.  She has no interest in it really.
B0000714BP|5.0|My mom had mentioned that a few years ago there was this movie that had Patrick Swayze in it and he dressed as a woman and went on this road trip with other cross dressers.  The hardest thing about this movie is knowing and remembering the title.  I ended up finding it by dumb luck. since owning this movie from the end of December 2008, I have watched it 5 times.  Great movie and it just cracks me up!

B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is our favorite version of The Christmas Carol. We love the Muppets' charming twist on the classic.  Gonzo is a perfect narrator (accompanied by Rizzo the rat), Kermit and Miss Piggy are a great fit as the Crachits, and Michael Caine is a perfectly nasty Scrooge. The songs are fun and catchy, and the message of the original comes through plainly. Treat yourself to this fun rendition!

B000O179FO|4.0|Dreamgirls was the very first musical I ever had the pleasure of seeing live on Broadway.  I loved the story and music then and, with a few reservations, love it nearly just as much now.  I won't spend time reviewing the content of the movie beyond saying that Dreamgirls has some truly great musical setpieces, mired in a fragmeted, episodic presentation that I do not remember being so prevalent in the stage production.<br /><br />As far as this blu-ray release goes, this is 5-star demo material through and through.  The source is literally flawless, with colors, contrast and black levels all rock solid.  Images are crystal clear with stunning texture detail and depth of field.  Like Hairspray, this film appears somehow more colorful than real life.  This appears to be the intent of the filmakers and is not a knock against the excellent transfer at all.<br /><br />Regarding the audio, there is NO HI-RES AUDIO on this disc!  This is inexplicable given that it is a musical.  However, the included 640kbps Dolby Digital 5.1 surround track is among the best non-hi-res soundtracks I've ever heard.  It just makes me wonder how much better it could have sounded in a lossless format (sigh).<br /><br />In summary, I have some issues with the film overall but would own it anyway for the great music and setpieces.  The hi-def video is unadulterated demo material, but the lack of corresponding hi-res audio is a criminal oversight and costs this review one star.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|beautiful box and well organized, this series is just as I remember.Great writing and fabulous acting. It's great to have these episodes to watch and share with others.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I have no personal experience with the Settlers of Catan board game. I purchased it as a Christmas present for my daughter and her family. It was on her \\"wish list\\". She has reported back that they have enjoyed playing it and give it high marks for being fun, entertaining, and challenging and educational in terms of strategy, planning and management. The ages of the players in the family range from 11 to adult, making \\"Catan\\" a good family game.
0345472640|5.0|This is an excellent book, from which a great movie was made, written by the Commanding Officer that was there - not a revisionist's account.  Brutally honest, heart wretching at times, this page-turner is an outstanding read.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Movie was excellent, i actually saw this 4 times in theaters lol.  Managed to get it in the mail the same day it came out on dvd.  Since then i've watched about 10 times or so.  The only problem i had was two face.  I feel his role should of had more to it.  But other than that, i consider this one of the best batman movies ever made.  And i've seen all of em :D
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|A young woman, raised by a single parent mother, prepares for her upcoming wedding on a Greek island. Upon finding her mother's old diary, she discovers that her unknown father could have been one of three men. She invites all three to attend her wedding, on the juvenile assumption that she will \\"know\\" her father when she meets him. Of course she tells neither her mother nor the three men of her plans. The plot is similar to the much better \\"Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell\\" (1968).<br /><br />The story is woven around a large number of songs from the 70s musical group ABBA. The film's shortcoming is that there are simply too many songs and not enough story. The thinly-plotted story is merely an excuse to sing and dance, which is why I called it a revue. Consequently, we learn very little about the three men, surely the past lives and personalities of her potential fathers would be of great interest to the girl. All we learn about them is that one is a sort of adventure-travel writer, and the other two are suit-wearing businessmen - one of whom is gay, the other divorced.<br /><br />Acting, from both youthful and veteran actors is at the flamboyant, gushy, everything is a crisis, teenage level. The singing and dancing are good, though not the original ABBA recordings. If you liked \\"High School Musical\\" you will probably like this one too.
B001H5X7KC|5.0|My wife said this was the funniest Ben Stiller movie she'd ever seen.  I don't know if I'd agree with that completely, but it's one of his best, as a director or star.  \\"Tropic Thunder\\" begins with fake trailers for fake movies and fake products of the characters, and play like bits from the old \\"Ben Stiller Show\\" on Fox.  (You remember, right?  From around 1990?  10 pm on Sundays?  With \\"Flying Blind,\\" it was the funniest hour on TV.)      Then the movie kicks into gear.  Imagine a loopy \\"Hearts of Darkness\\" with some fake blood and guts, and you get the general idea.  While Stiller, Downey and company keep the plot moving, Tom Cruise steals the show as the demented, over-the-top studio head.  As much as I don't care for many of his off-screen antics and causes, he has to get credit where credit is due.  Nick Nolte and Matthew McConaghy also do very well with the small amount of screentime they get.  The plot progresses pretty much as you would expect, with some funny surprises along the way.      \\"Tropic Thunder\\" is not for the easily offended, and is not suitable for young children.  This may be why this movie garners so many 1 star reviews.  But if you don't mind a little offensiveness in the service of excellent comedy, you will probably like this film.  It's at least worth a rent.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is an awesome game. It is almost like playing tetris but on a board. Each person has color shapes and you have to fit as many as you can on the board by only touching your corners. My 11 year old loves to play it as do my husband and I. Its a great family game.

B000002L9J|5.0|I must confess my sin of having entered college from a small New England town where my music diet was classic rock, classic rock, and more classic rock.  Did I mention we listend to classic rock?  Things started to change when I became a fan of Big Country, which I am to this day....  The Queen is Dead was dropped in my lap the first week I arrived at KSC and there was no turning back from alternative/indy music.  Marr's guitars, Morrisey vocals, and the rest of the band had a groove, a voice, and general sound that is still being copied today.  There is not a single Smiths record NOT worth owning.  Go for it!!!!!!
1592289444|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I sit back and wonder how a true story such as this one can't be #1 for years.
B000000WGL|4.0|After the release of Dirty Work the Stones were on the verge of a breakup with the Glimmer twins not on speaking terms.  As always, Keith wanted to rock and Mick wanted to wonk... listen to She's the Boss and you will get the picture.  Keith put together a band very much in the Stones mold...heck, Bobby Keyes is the sax player.... release an album and hit the road, which they did for this album and Main Offender.  If you love the Stones and have always had a special place in your heart for Keith's vocals...  Think Happy and Little T&A.... this record is for you!!!!!  I saw the Winos on the Main Offender tour... awesome.

0061120073|5.0|I read this book last month....should have read it while an adolescent.  Setting is pre-Depression era about the struggles of the American 'family', some born in country, others immigrants or first generation. You gain a tremdous appreciation for what we have now, AND on so many levels. Social stigmas related to accepting 'charity', the cruelty of those with money against those 'without' and the sheer STRENGTH of the human spirit when facing adversity. THis book led me to examine my own reality and realize how fortunate I am to have all that I do.
B0011N1WE8|4.0|A great message given with an exceptional story and cast. When wealthy young ladies parents try to find her a husband there is only one catch, she has the nose of a pig, literally. This cute almost fairytale story is a romantic look at what would happen if in fact a typical NY baby was cursed by a wicked witch today. The cast includes Christina Ricci, James McAvoy, Catherine O'Hara, and Reese Witherspoon. The story unfolds telling us how the curse on the family began and shows some of what Penelope endured as a child. Then we get to see her life as an adult and how she copes with it daily. Most of her time is spent in her room, but when one of her suiters seems genuinely interested in her and shows her the outdoors she starts to brave it on her own. Good quality DVD with good replayability. This is a family friendly movie. If you enjoyed this, catch \\"Legally Blonde\\".<br /><br />CA Luster
B001EOQWEO|4.0|Disc 1 was a little scratched, jittery at the beginning of the movie, but no other problems
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I love Taylor Swift.  She is a very talented song writer and singer. I hope she stays around for a long time.  She is what young girls need to look up to this day in age.
159448385X|5.0|Prior to reading A Thousand Splendid Sons,  Afghanistan was a flash on the TV screen or maybe an in depth story on the NPR station.  Now it is a human story about real women and their families.  The author is a vivid story teller and tells and unforgettable tale of tragedy and triumph.
B0000549B0|5.0|I watched this movie with my son (who is 24 years old) and his friend.  We all were laughing all the way through the movie and it was a great movie with a mixture of comedy and a heart warming feel.  It was great for all, even my son who had never even heard of the movie.  James Stewart was great.
B001F12J0C|5.0|Fast Shipping, Great Price. Highly Recommended. Excellent Transaction.    Movies were awesome! Bonus features worth watching.
B00005JPS8|5.0|My husband had this on his Christmas list.  I bought it we watched the movie the next night and I even thought it was great.  He sat up after watching hours of \\"the making of\\" and \\"deleted scenes\\" and such.  For those who like action, effects, and super heros Iron Man is a great pick.
B001CQONKY|5.0|Season 8 doesn't disappoint.  The series gets better all the time.  I can't wait for season 9.
B001KMB6X2|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty good. A pretty generic first sentence for a review, but that sums up my thoughts fairly well.     Babylon A.D. had its pros and cons.     As far as pros go, it kept me entertained and wanting to see how the story would end up. In other words, it was interesting. The actors did a great job as well. I thought the special effects were beautiful and realistic.     As far as cons go, the movie was confusing. I found the plot hard to keep up with, especially towards the end. There was no real closure when the movie ended, and left you wondering where the plot was supposed to be ending up, and whether or not you really grasped what was intended.    But overall, I enjoyed watching Babylon A.D.
B001DPC52C|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Within Temptation, love pretty much all their songs, Sharon has to me one of the very best vocals out there. If you like symphonic, melodic metal and have never heard Within Temptation, buy this cd/dvd, there's no way I can imagine you won't be totally satisfied in your purchase. There is no \\"grunge\\" in there songs, just Sharon singing beautiful sounding songs. They're Danish,but all their songs are in English. I only hope someday they are touring USA's east coast, I would love to see them in person.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is an outstanding series, very well researched.  Acting was outstanding and they did an excellent casting of characters.  I would highly recommend.  I viewed the three discs on three separate nights but when I watch it again I'll probably do an all-nighter to keep the flow better.
6305511055|5.0|Condor is one of my all time favorite movies. I try to watch it at least once a year--always on a rainy Sunday afternoon in November (to really get into the Condor setting, I suppose). I have watched this movie at least twenty times throughout the years, and think I fully understood it for the first time in the last viewing. There are so many nuances of the film that one needs to watch it several times to fully appreciate the film.
0740748475|5.0|I bought this for my 16 year old daughter for Christmas this year!  She loved it. Best books ever. Complete collection. Quite heavy though.
B000WCBPOG|5.0|Over the llifetime of a body of music there will be cover versions.  This album goes beyond the cover and finds the spirit of invention.  Each track interprets the original song with fresh vision.
B000002UAF|1.0|The CD was not in new condition case had 5 cuts, music skipped. Tried NUMEROUS times to contact business but NEVER heard from them.  Don't buy from them!
B00011F5DK|5.0|I'm a Mom of two children. I've bought this game for my 5 year old daughter and I'm hooked on it!!! I enjoy it as much as she does! She got the idea of the game pretty fast. My 2-year old son likes to \\"play\\" it as well, he builds diffrent shapes from unused pieces and gives them names. I reccomend this game for all families!
B000R7I3LY|2.0|\\"Love Song\\" is catchy, and the most likely reason people have listened to this album.  After giving it a try, I have to say that no other songs have any strong melodies or hooks.  Nothing is grating or annoying, but nothing sticks out either.  The piano playing and instrumentation are quite simple.  The other songs generally blend together, and I've listened to it enough to make a fair judgment about that.  There are better albums out there.
B001L7TDQ8|5.0|This is a worldwide musical highlight of New Year's day. I watch it on TV with my wife every year. This year (1/1/2009) a children's ballet sequence (absolutely brilliant) was interwoven into the fabric of the concert/video during the orchestra's performance of The Blue Danube. Vienna has a depth of creative music and artistic talent that boggles the mind. Apparently it is boundless. Wonderful.
B000UX6THK|5.0|david lynch was ahead of his time. a great dvd, but a better show!  much better than the crap on network tv.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|The is one set of DVD's that I would say is to buy.  It appears that they have cleared up the movie graphics a bit and the extra DVD's give the Matrix series greater depth.  This is a moust have for any collector.  I, for one, am glad that I did buy this
157492589X|4.0|I had a difficult time finding this VCR tape. It was for a Christmas gift  for someone who doesn't yet have a DVD player. I couldn't find it ANYWHERE.  But, Amazon.Com came to the rescue !!!  The person I gave it to, said it was absolutely fine, with the exception of a few tracking  problems.  This is a beautiful story...a classic...even better that  \\"Brokeback Mountain\\" !!!!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Love this movie, no wonder it ended in all critics top picks for the year.  Great short included in the DVD too.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|paul mccartney and youth(ex-killing joke bassist) are collectively know as the fireman. their first two albums were very ambient sounding and eno-esque. the vocals bring a new element to the fireman's music. the first cut is heavy, reminds me of helter skelter(the slower alternate version on anthology 3) or early wings like mumbo or the mess (from wild life and band on the run respectively). only complaint is the packaging. almost broke cd trying to pull it out of case
B00006DEFA|5.0|My friend and I love this film (and the original play).  I got this for him for his birthday.  It arrived promptly in great condition.  My friend is thrilled to own this Director's Cut Two-Disc Special Edition.
031606792X|5.0|This books is awesome!!! I read the other 3 and had to finish the set.  All 4 books were page turners. Couldn't put them down.  Hopefully Ms. Meyers is writing more.  You can't help but want to find out more about the characters-where they are and what they're doing!!!
B0000X61VE|5.0|This is an excellent way to get into shape.  I have never had another video or gym membership work faster at getting me into shape. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for great results.
B000W9DTG6|5.0|Each and every installment to this film was great in it's own way. I am very happy with this set and glad I got it for myself.
B000QUEQBS|5.0|I need to add a positive review for this movie.  It was definitely my second favorite movie of 2008 (I liked Saw V better).  This movie has a lot of action and explosions in it and kept me wondering until the end.  I really like Walberg and he does not disappoint in this movie.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This is an simple but awesome strategy game.  Makes you think in new ways. From the 11 yr old to the 59 yr old - we enjoyed playing this game!
B001EIOOVS|5.0|Crowe and Washington really make a great movie in this one.  There is a lot of action and it is based on a true story, which always makes movies more interesting, in my opinion.  The movie is somewhat longer than normal, but that is ok because Im kind of tired of 85 minute movies anyways.    This is a great movie and is not very child friendly, but that should be obvious by the rating.
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I'm a huge fan of the new & the old Doctor Who. I find that Doctor #10 paired with Donna Nobel is the best pairing since #2 & James Robert McCrimmon. Both sets of Doctor/Companion could carry out the saddest, most dramatic moment right through the funniest comedy with everything that might happen in between.  I give this season two really big thumbs up!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is one of the best sci-fi shows ever.  Fox's inability to air the show in order and in proper times caused the show to be canceled after one season, but it is still an amazing show!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|Great movie. Wonderful premise, exceptionally well-written. One of the smartest romantic comedies I've ever seen. This is one of those movies that makes you feel smart if you get it, in part because all of the characters are smart (all of them are named after engineers or mathematicians). It's a calm movie, but not slow - every minute is interesting. It has one of my favorite quotes of all time:<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman: \\"Let's start at ridiculous and move backwards.\\"<br /><br />And the perfect cast is just top-notch. Emma Thompson and Queen Latifah play off each other brilliantly, as do Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. And Dustin Hoffman, of course, is always a pleasure to watch.
B000000OSG|5.0|Use Your Illusion part 2.  Many say that comparing to the first part, this one has more substance and less filler.  Others say the band should have just combined the two albums into one, with the best material of each.  However, if the band did that, those same people would compalin that we got a slew of unreleased songs and should just make an album of them as well.  Oh well, you can't please everyone.    That said, part II of this theatrical masterpiece is considered by many to be the last great effort by the band.  If that were the case, then they pulled no punches!  An album that had it all; great rockers, heavy ballads, deep lyrics, and heavy GnR style riffs!  There is definetly no shortage of what makes GnR one of the best bands of all time!    1. Civil War - Starts of haunting, with a portion from the movie Cool Hand Luke as soft whistling comes in.  Awesome way to open an album (which GnR have always been good at) with heavy riffs and deep, meaningful lyrics; really sets the tone for where the album can go.  5/5    2. 14 Years - This song did take me a bit to get into fully, however I feel there is some great harmony on this track.  Aside from that, there is very solid bass playing as well.  Could this song have been some serious forshadowing for how long it would take to release Chinese Democracy?  Haha, with GnR you never really know.  4/5    3. Yesterdays - I would consider this song to be the first ballad on the record.  To me it has that tone of the heavier portion of \\"November Rain\\" and there definetly is that element of having had more production.  Making is sound grander and bigger for the final product.  Again, the bass is what stands out for me here, and really brings everything together in a very solid song.  4/5    4. Knockin' On Heaven's Door - Although this is a cover song, this may be the most recognizable version.  In my opinion it is one of the best covers ever heard.  The band may have over-produced this song in spots again making it soundvery large and theatrical, but it works because the lyrics are very powerful.  Everything gels together so well here, and Slash's guitar work shines through!  5/5    5. Get In The Ring - Now, many people may think this song falls a bit short for the bands standards, but I'll tell you, I like it.  In the beginning, you hear a crowd chanting \\"Guns N' Roses\\" with a bluesy overtone of Slash's guitar, then the heavier riffs and drums blast in for that classic GnR rockin' feel!  What I also like about this song is the fact that it has that straight-up rockin' feel, but maintains that bluesy over-tone!  The entire band gets into the act here, and it just seems like an awesome song to write and perform!  5/5    6. Shotgun Blues - This song picks up right where \\"GITR\\" leaves off.  Heavy rocker, with solid guitar playing from Slash.  Duff also stands out pretty heavy here!  Another solid song that seems like it was fun to create; a lot of RAW emotion.  4.5/5    7. Breakdown - Another song with a slightly softer bluesy tone.  Starts with awesome whistling from Rose (ala Patience) then comes in with pretty solid guitar work.  I think the piano is what brings everything together on this track, one of the under-rated gems on the album as a whole.  5/5    8. Pretty Tied Up - An awesome track!  Truly a Guns N' Roses rocker! The way Axl sings is very slow and kind of sinister.  When the guitars and drums kick in, you know this is going to be a killer tune.  Very solid, and very cool!  5/5    9. Locomotive - Another solid track here.  Has the essential heavy riffs, almost like \\"Appetite\\", yet again has a sort of bluesy influence within it.  Axl also adds a new trick to enhance his vocal technique on this song; not sure if that fits in the end, but the lyrics are amazing and really fit the rest of the album.  4.5/5    10. So Fine - It took be a few to get into this song, but feel it is pretty powerful within the context.  Duff McKagen again stands out here and shows that he is very essential to the overall flow of the band.  4/5    11. Estranged - A very, very powerful ballad from the band here.  In some ways I think it could beat out \\"November Rain\\" I hear a lot of emotion from everyone in this song, and Slash does an amazing job brininging that emotion out through his guitar.  Drums also play a key role in this song as it keeps everything on pace and really stands out against the screech of the guitars.  Amazing!  5/5    12. You Could Be Mine - This is just one of those killer songs that you'd expect GnR to put out.  When I saw them in concert back in '06 and this tune came up, the crowd just erupted.  Amazing track with heavy lyrics, heavy guitar, heavy and raw emotion!  5/5    13. Don't Cry (alt. lyrics) - For those with UYI part I, you know this song,  Good track, but really I do feel there is no need for the same song to be on a double album of work, alternate lyrics or not.  Good song oversll, and a GnR classic.  4.5/5    14.  My World - I hated this track at first, but the more I listened, the more it caught my attention.  Very heavy, very raw.  GnR captured that raw feel that listeners heard on \\"Appetite\\" and close out the album on a very, very heavy note!    There you have it, two albums of masterpiece work.  Was this the end of the GnR golden era?  You be the judge!
B000W04S6U|5.0|I got this cd four days early. It was my first online purchase and I was pleased with the package tracking. All of the music is good quality and it's very different from most music I have in my collection. The pace of the music changes a lot. Track 3 of disk 2 is my faveroate beacause it motivates me. If you like veriaty then I recomend it to you.    Sorry if I can't spell great.
B000N6TYLW|5.0|What an appropriate ending to the best show television has seen since the days of Seinfeld! You cannot beat the wittiness of the Paladinos' writing and the speed of the show just makes it that much more entertaining. Love it, and can't wait for the movie (fingers crossed!).
B0011UBDTK|3.0|Amazon offered a great price for the set.  Unfortunately, one of the DVD's was bad and had to reorder another set.  Amazon was great in handling this transaction.  Immediately sent out another set and is giving me a month to return the old set before charging for the 2nd set.
B00000K31Q|4.0|\\"10 Things I Hate About You\\" is a film I find myself renting every few years; so I should probably break down and buy a copy.  As Heath Ledger's first major film in the US, it has become the starting point for one of Hollywood's most memorable careers.  Ledger of course was nominated for an Oscar for [[ASIN:B00005JOFQ Brokeback Mountain (Widescreen Edition)]] and seems likely for another nomination for his work in \\"The Dark Knight.\\"  As Patrick Verona, he's the hard-edged kid who falls for the girl least likely to be romanced.<br /><br />As Kat Stratford, Julia Stiles won an award from the Chicago Film Critics Association as \\"Most Promising Actress.\\"  With her work in the Bourne series and her new film \\"The Bell Jar,\\" she's continued to be visible.  She does a great job of walking that fine line between the shrew who disdains pretense and a girl to whom we can still lose our hearts.  Her dance scene is hysterical.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt who was a regular on TV's \\"Third Rock from the Sun\\" and who I have watched recently in [[ASIN:B0013FSL1Q Stop-Loss]], [[ASIN:B000FVQM2Y Brick]] & [[ASIN:B000F6II1M Mysterious Skin (Deluxe Unrated Director's Edition)]] plays Cameron James, the love-struck teen who must get a guy to date Kat before he can go out with her sister.<br /><br />Larisa Oleynik who appeared several times on \\"Third Rock\\" plays Bianca as a superficial party girl.  Their dad is played by Larry Miller who was on the \\"Joe Day Afternoon\\" episode of one of my favorite TV shows, \\"Medium.\\"  Andrew Keegan who was on TV's \\"Party of Five\\" plays the narcissistic Joey Donner who pays Patrick to date Kat.  Allison Janey from TV's \\"West Wing\\" has a delightful cameo as the assistant principal Ms. Perky who moonlights by writing romance novels.  Daryl Mitchell has a very funny role as the teacher Mr. Morgan who seems to dislike his students whenever possible.  David Krumholtz who is the mathematician on TV's \\"Numbers\\" and who was in [[ASIN:B000WZEZGI Superbad (Unrated Widescreen Edition)]] looks youthful as the brainy Michael who suggests to Cameron how to get a date with Bianca.<br /><br />Gil Junger directed the film.  He has done extensive directing on television for series like \\"Dharma & Greg\\" & \\"Ellen\\" & is currently directing a TV update of this same film.

B000002UAO|5.0|I am a Beatles fanatic. I own every LP (for you younger folks, that stands for Long Play (vinyl) record) and I own every CD. Of course, it's impossible to pick a favorite Beatles CD but Rubber Soul is one of the best.  It's a great transitional album between their pop, bubblegum years (think She Loves You) and their psychedelic years (think Sgt. Peppers). In order to determine which Beatles CD I thought was my favorite or at least one of my favorites, I checked my Ipod to see which Beatle's CD has the most songs on it (my Ipod).  Rubber Soul has the most (12 of 14 songs). Need I say more???

0345409671|4.0|In the dark futile recesses of my once lurid imagination there existed a place close to what Memnoch would describe as hell. I was fascinated by this character and the world he hid so easily in. This book gives a strong presentation of what I always enjoyed about Anne Rice's novels. It envelopes the reader into the shadows of soggy street corners and mysterious silhouettes only to reveal a hidden underworld that makes even vampires cringe. Are we being inducted into an alternate theology or introduced to a feeling that can only be visited by our souls? That is up to the reader to decide. Either way, it was one of the few stories that truly pulled me from this reality and into another that appeared unlike anything I have ever read before.
B00009YOQW|2.0|My son loves anything to do with drums, but he really isn't into this toy. I think he'd like it better if it came with two drumsticks instead of only one. Also, I find it interesting that the drum is cut to make three different tones, but the choice of tones is off-putting.
B0016PM722|5.0|This was a gift from Santa.  This lightsaber is beyond amazing.  From the illumination it provides in a room at 5:30a to the sounds it makes when swished five feet in front of you.  It has provided hours of imagination, which has encouraged stories in Writer's workshop in our son's classroom.  If you are a collector, of any age, this is a MUST.  I, myself, enjoy the heaviness of the handle and the precision look.  Sturdy beyond belief.
0316143472|5.0|This is the first book I have read by David Sedaris. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I am a big fan of his sister Amy, and enjoy her writing too.
B000MRAAJW|5.0|Ordered well in time to receive and TEST out before giving as a gift.  Certainly glad I did!  The DVD's did not work. Four discs, tried out on 6 different DVD players and /or computer disc drives. Seller had snarky comments about my issue and we are currently trying to get replacement.  Very inconvenient, irritating and disappointing. I still have not given the gift and the holidays are over.......
B0011Z5CV0|1.0|This toy could possibly interest an infant.  Having said that, my daughter is 17th months and did not look twice.  His trunk plays a single note with every shape pushed... big deal.  I tried to interest her in the recording option, but she was not interested in hearing a bunch of random notes played back to her.    For $[...] this is a complete waste of money.
B001F12J48|1.0|As it's our favorite Christmas movie (we also have it on Blu-ray), we thought it would be fun to see it in 3-D.  It is UNWATCHABLE!  The colors are beyond awful and the 3-D effects pathetic. We tried through different scenes and finally gave up after a couple of minutes.  The glasses which are provided can only comfortably fit people with tiny heads.  By the way, we have a brand new Philips LCD 42\\" and followed all the guidelines.  Do not buy in 3-D. Just enjoy this great movie on regular DVD or better yet, on Blu-ray.
0060763280|5.0|This book has some really good ideas and if your goal is to become wealthy, this book is a good read.
B0017YDPI2|5.0|This product I am highly recommand to every one who like mystery movie.  Unfortunately, this product doesn't carry any Chinese subtitles as what they told you.  This is the only one thing which make me feel disappointed.
1563894696|5.0|This has become one of my favorite Batman stories of all time, and I've been reading Batman for 35 years.<br /><br />The story-telling is crisp.  The artwork is beautiful.  And this builds a great foundation under the Batman mythos that has grown over the past decade.<br /><br />Since this story is built around Batman's encounters with the Falcone and Moroni mob families, I love the homage paid to our greatest mob movies (The Godfather I & II, and Goodfellas).  I re-read the book just to see how many scenes and lines I could connect to those movies (as well as its tribute to another of my favorite movies: The Silence of the Lambs).<br /><br />This really shows us the descent of Harvey Dent into the psychopath known as Two-Face, but we root for him anyway.<br /><br />One of the all-time best!
B001HDO4Z6|3.0|nothing is really great as parachutes and arobtth...i hope coldplay will do other songs like all the songs written and played during the parachutes and arobtth period...they were coldplay....i love them...i still love them and their songs...but no song of x&y or viva la vida will ever be like parachutes or arobtth...  all parachutes is perfect in my opinion, a rush of blood to the head is superb. they lost they essence but we have to consider that they couldn't do always the same songs...i miss parachutes but i think it has been good for them to have tried a new way...the problem is that i think it is not the correct right way...    anyway i like prospekt's march...i love glass of water, i like litii and i like prospekt's march..now my feet won't touch the ground is too much similar to til kingdom come but it is not bad..i often skip on rainy days...    anyway, please coldplay please play more parachutes and arobtth at your concerts!!!!!!!
B001GKYBXA|4.0|What a nice surprise this album is! Sure I've been a Beatle fan all my life so I think I \\"owe\\" it to Paul to at least check out his albums-and I end up buying them! This project was a little different and I approached it reluctantly..I'm glad I did have a listen to the tracks because they're some of the best things Paul has done for  quite a while. There's a freshness and vitality that belies his (slightly) advancing years.let's face it-he just lives and breathes music-and the spontaneous approach of this album works beautifully. Buy it-and play it loud!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is my all-time favorite Christmas movie!!  I can watch over and over again!!
0743298039|5.0|This truly is one of the finest novels I've ever read--well worth all the hoopla.<br /><br />The main narrator has a smooth voice that is easy to get lost in, and I loved the theme of the importance of \\"story tellers\\" in our society.  I loved the stories within stories within stories.<br /><br />This is a clear and easy read, but the multiple levels of the novel and character development are brilliant.<br /><br />I would highly, highly recommend this book for anyone to enjoy with a cup of hot chocolate on a rainy afternoon.
B001DPHDCY|5.0|Always a hit! It's a very cute movie and kids seem to love it as well as adults!
0810979772|4.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old Godson and he loved it.  I gabe it to him along with the novel... so he got into the novel right away so that he could start filling in the diary.

0140120416|5.0|Why are there 5 stars next to nearly all the reviews? Because this text is most deserving of them. I'd give 6 stars if I could. Russian, like any inflectional language, is an especially difficult one to grasp but this book dosn't miss a beat and is most excellent for the novice and self-taught types. It is exceedingly well organized and all inclusive and you notice a rapid progression into advanced reading. There are parts that are skippable (is that a word?) if you are only interested in reading but so much detail is in the footnotes, etc. that it is worth reading every little thing. Tons of material of interest is also included as well as the many nuances of the language. I absolutely recommend this as a first text. The first obstacle will  be the alphabet. Having learned ancient Greek, I had less difficulty than some others might have but you will soon grow used to the oddities of Cyrillic. You won't be dissapointed, I promise !
B000002I77|5.0|I've owned this release as an album and wore it's grooves off.  It opens energetically and goes thru several interesting mood changes but is never less than melodically inspiring.  Cobham surrounds himself with top-drawer players with Bolin being a truly awesome choice on guitar.  But Hammer is no wallflower here either and I think some reviewers may be confused as to whose soloing but it's often Hammer.  The quiet cuts are short and a welcome break from the intense longer pieces.  My favorite comes at the end with a truly funky RED BARON but in reality I can listen to this from beginning to end.  Billy Cobham IMHO fared much better than any other member of Mahavishnu Orchestra (excepting McLaughlin) and this solo debut proved it hands down.  A true rock/fusion masterpiece that has aged well because the band was tight, the material sterling.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I expected Dark Knight on blu ray to be a wonderful addtion to my small collection and I was not disappointed. The quality of the images are incredible, and I enjoyed the contrast ratio change as the film went in and out of the filmed Imax ratio.  It was very cool to see the 1080p resolution fill up the entire screen for much of the movie. The special features are good as well and most if not all are also in HD. If you liked the movie, then there is no better see it again than on Blu ray.
0765342294|5.0|I bought this book for my boyfriend, because he's just starting ot get into reading. But I read it before him! It was great!
0793518326|4.0|I am a 25+ year guitar player and bought this for my 14 year old daughter who has been playing approx 1 year. I find the tabs to be very accurate.  For a guitar player, the complete scores are almost too much information and the font size is small compared to guitar-only tab books, but it is not a major issue. If you want to learn to play Beatles songs, complete with chords, leads and riffs, this is the book to buy. I would have rated it 5 stars had is just been for guitar.
B000TGJ7ZY|4.0|I will refrain reviewing the film here (as obviously it's one of my favorites or I wouldn't have purchased it on Blu Ray) but instead concentrate on the transfer and content, which I found satisfactory but not exceptional.  Firstly, the deleted scenes were a great addition to the Blu Ray disc. I only wish there were more! Being the nerd that I am, I had purchased a companion book to the film back in 1992 that had the whole script and now finally I get to see those scenes I had only previously been able to imagine.  The transfer was decent, but honestly I would have wished for a little more in the way of brightness. I ran this simultaneously with my old Superbit DVD and kept switching back and forth to compare. Now while the obvious clarity and sharpness of HD, along with greater color depth was apparent, I did notice that the Blu Ray was markedly darker. Some shadow detail was lost as a result, and oddly enough I found myself seeing small details in the DVD that were rather obscured on the Blu Ray. Somewhat disappointing.  The other thing was odd - the English subtitles that are displayed in the opening sequences had changed in font from the original. On this version they are in a very standard looking font, whereas the old VHS and DVD versions had a more old fashioned style font that I personally feel matched the look of the film more effectively. A very minor gripe but still, stylistically speaking it seems a little incongruous and unnecessary on the whole.  Part of me hopes that perhaps a special edition or director's cut may lie in the future. I'd love to see the deleted scenes restored, a slightly brighter transfer, and those original subtitles back in action.
B00080ZG1A|5.0|This is an outstanding, expansive, detailed portrait of the enigmatic and eccentric billionaire playboy and aviation enthusiast/Hollywood producer (Hell's Angels) Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) in the years (the 1920s through the 1940s) leading up to his bouts of insanity and decline from the spotlight. It's ambitious and never disappoints. It is bound to become a classic. The Aviator is a riveting film with a thoughtful, provocative script that delves into the many aspects of Hughes personality: the explorer (he bought TWA and flew planes and constantly planned on building bigger and better airplanes), the playboy (he dated and love Katharine Hepburn (a commendable performance by Cate Blanchett who embodies all Hepburn's traits and her accent) and Ava Gardiner (Beckinsale) and squired many other starlets around town), the germ-o-phobe (he constantly washed his hands and became obsessed with touching and cleanliness), the consummate businessman (he fought Congress and Pan Am for the right for TWA to fly abroad) and the perfectionist who analyzed everything he did. DiCaprio is amazing as always as he sheds light on this strange, wonderful and wealthy man. He brings so many layers to the character. We feel sorry for him, we root for him, and we get upset when he doesn't win.  It's mesmerizing.
031606792X|5.0|I loved it! I am 100% addicted to Cullens. I hope that Sephenie will write more books. I finished my last book less than a week ago and I am very sad that I am done.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|[[ASIN:B0002F6AH0 The World at War (30th Anniversary Edition)]]    I have this series in VHS but don't have a player anymore, so I was surprised to find it on Amazon. I never expected to find the series on DVD. Amazon's price is the best around. I almost paid $30 or more for it in stores. This is an excellent, historical, series on World War II.
B000T9OP7G|4.0|Hello,    i was very happy with the time of Delivery and the product itself.    don know what more to say ....    thanks Craig
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I just shot a roller derby practice with this flash and didn't run into the thermal shutdown issues others have had. Perhaps they got touchy units. I love the different flash patterns. There are three: Even, Center-weighted, and standard. \\"Even\\" truly lights up the entire frame evenly. I really like the fact that this flash zooms to 200mm as that is my farthest reaching lens. My only complaint is that in FX mode, it will only expand to 17mm (with the wide angle filter out) and I have a 16mm fisheye. Needless to say, the corners are dark. My SB800 will accommodate down to 14mm. I will hang onto my 800 for that reason, plus the Nikon Creative Lighting System rocks! The more flashes in your bag, the better.  Cameras used: D300, D700, and F100
B001BKG9SK|5.0|Excellent show. I've witnessed Pink Floyd live many times and David Gilmour solo. The best I have ever seen.    Juda
0783225903|5.0|well heres a film that ill never get tired of seeing. when i was fourteen i liked it but didnt really get it. at 18 i found it amusing and nutty. at 21 its resonates to the core of my soul. really good movie to see every few years.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This was purchased for a Christmas present.  The price was great and it arrived faster than expected.
B001GQACGE|1.0|I'm so glad I only paid 1/2 price for this double CD. And maybe that was too much. There are only about 3 cuts in total that are worth listening to. I just expected more from a super star like Beounce.
B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I cannot believe all the 5 star reviews. I was looking forward to this movie because EVERYONE LOVED IT! I guess I am in the minority, because the movie had no plot plus the singing is really bad. Meryl Streep, a great actress, is not right for this part as is most of the cast. It is almost like the cast is having a ongoing party and forget they are making a movie.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|The DVD is functional and damage free.  The DVD case is made of cardboard and is different than those purchased at retail locations.  Very disappointed with the commercial packaging - makes it difficult for storage with other DVD boxes.
B001DDBCUK|5.0|i loved it, but then again, i would watch these women read the phone book for 2 hours! just a terrific continuation of one of my favorite shows.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|As a collector of old movies, this is one I have wanted for a long time.  Whenever I want a hard to get movie, I come to your company.  Thank you for the movies I have gotten through you and thank you for being on the look-out for ones I still want.  Forbidden Worlds is a \\"classic\\" Sci-fi.
B000002KK2|5.0|I know she continues to have her followers and rightfully so. I always give her recordings a chance because of how much I like this first one. \\"The Horses\\" is also great but this one simply gets the most air time in my household. All of the songs have a deeply personal tone sung from the heart. My favorite is \\"Young Blood\\" and the lyrics to \\"Last Chance Texaco\\" is brilliant. I can't imagine anyone doing a cover of any of her songs. Only she can sing them the way she does. Her music is as unique as her name.
6305212112|5.0|Although the film's title makes perfect sense, when the film is viewed, it is nevertheless a most 'off-putting' title prior to viewing the film.    The film, however, is excellent! A very well formulated story line is accentuated by superb acting - particularly by the main characters.     Placing anything in order of merit is a mugs game - so much is variable. However, in my estimation 'Fried Green Tomatoes' comes in the top 10% of movies ever made in  the English speaking world - to date.     It is most enjoyable, if one likes fine acting and a rollicking good story.
0060797509|3.0|The book was great and my grandaughter loved it, but the neckless chain was broke inside the book.I had to go buy a new chain the day after christmas.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|My daughter and I love kicking back and watching the Gilmore Girls series from the beginning. The clever bantor and interesting characters make for a very enjoyable show.
B000V86OKG|5.0|This is one of my favorite series. I like the way in which you \\"hear\\" what he is thinking and how he comes to his conclusions. The series is highly entertaining. (I think the subject matter is not suitable for children under the impressionable age of 18.) Nice thing about this show is there is very little \\"gore\\". Things are implied and shown in a very tasteful manner. 5 stars all the way! Wish we had more real Dexter's in the world. I do endorse what the character is doing........cleaning up the trash!
B001F0VHEM|5.0|Probably more lighthearted than some of Pink's earlier albums.  Lilting and fun to listen to.
074356619X|5.0|I enjoy the Cd's that I listen to when I drive - after reading the book several times, I like to hear the CD.  Excellent quality
0312360266|2.0|It was an alright book nothing special I decided 2 stop with this first book in the series didn't feel like wasting my money on the other books when I knew I didn't like the first one that much.
B000002KDX|5.0|When I first heard \\"Horse With No Name\\", of course the music of Neil Young sprang immediately to mind. And why not? Neil's vocal influence is clear and present, as are the CSN harmonies.    But my dirty little secret is, I no longer listen to CSN. And although I have owned every Neil album through the early 90's (and have been a huge Neil fan throughout much of my life), I don't listen to him much either nowadays.     But 35 years down the line, I find the songs on \\"America\\" have retained their melodic and harmonic beauty. Written by Bunnell, Beckley and Peek as young men, songs like \\"Clarice, Here, Riverside, Rainy Day, Three Roses, Horse With No Name\\" are still perfect songs. A musical timepiece that I suspect my children's children may listen to and enjoy.
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|I had written earlier because I had only gotten 1 part of a 2 part DVD. But then Sonic read my review, contacted me and sent the second part. So I raised them to 4 stars. Thank you. Pam Mendoza
0380799006|5.0|Fortunately for us, we were already exploring parenting books and had read \\"How to Talk\\" by the time our 2nd child was due.  This book opened our eyes to things that people say to or expect from the older sibling that can get things off to a bad start, and then of course build over the years.  We were lucky, I think, to get off to such an easy start.  My girl and boy -still- like to do things together and talk/support/hang with with each other, even as teens.  They also are building their own lives separate from each other, but are clearly friends.  The techniques and insights can be applied to any ages, as others have posted here about diffusing situations with their kids.  I always talk about this book if the topic of sibling fights comes up - we've had so few in all these years.  So now I'm reviewing it finally too, after so many years of recommending it in person.  (I also recommend \\"How to Talk...\\")
B0000C9ZBW|2.0|The clasp failed on mine.  I put a coat on and went to target.  It disappeared somewhere, of course noone turned it in.  I had trouble from day 1 with the clasp. It got lost within a week.  People are right, it's so light you don't notice it, and then the clasp unfastens and its gone.
1416955070|4.0|I'm a 30 something fan of young adult supernatural type books. I thought this was very cute and very fun story. You get involved with the characters and believe in this world that is created in the book. I'm looking forward to the next book but not enough to run out and buy the hard cover. This is a wait for paper back series...but you will come back to it.
032147404X|5.0|Scott Kelby demystifies digital photography methods often used by the pro's and does it with his a little humor thrown in. If you want to learn methods and skip all the technical jargon this is the book to buy. I highly recommend this great little tips and tricks book.

B00005JKTF|5.0|\\"Charlotte Gray\\" is the story of the love that causes people to fight and survive during a war. But war can cause heartache as well as romance. Death is often just around the next corner. Only the strong survive, and dare to carry on.<br /><br />Cate Blanchette (Elizabeth: The Golden Age, Indiana Jones, & The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) plays the fantastic role as Charlotte, Scottish, who becomes an SOE (Special Operation Executive) agent. She joins to search for her lover, Peter, who is a RAF pilot shot down in France.<br /><br />Under an alias, Charlotte gets involved with the resistance, and entangled in the lives of some Jewish families. She hears that Peter is dead, but continues to help with the local French effort as well as hide a pair of Jewish boys. She comes under the influence of Julien, a resistance fighter, himself 1/8th Jewish. War, unfortunately continues to take its toll with the lives of people Charlotte contacts.<br /><br />The questions is, will Charlotte survive the 1 out of 3 odds of returning home?<br /><br />A great job of filming within a small French town, making the set and action very realistic. This film shows a part of WWII often ignored. It has beautiful sets, even for a war-ravaged country. \\"Charlotte Gray\\" is about touching relationships and has the unexpected ending. A DVD VALUE for historical drama and romance. This DVD comes with subtitles to assist with the English, Scottish and German accents.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|Came right on time and like new.  Haven't seen this movie any ages and we got it and watched it as a family and layghed so hard all togther.  Thanks!
B0015T7Q98|2.0|This album to me is such a disappointment to be honest. After building a fan base off of their first album you would think Panic would hold true to the style they portrayed on the first go around. All I could tolerate off this latest album was, \\"Nine In The Afternoon.\\"<br /><br />Other than the lead singers vocal strength and quality (which by the way I thought he improved tremendously on this latest album) I loved everything about the first album. From the jumpy style of play to the song titles. I thought they were a great change of pace and solidified themselves as a fresh new act.<br /><br />But then I hear Pretty Odd and I think to myself, \\"are you trying to rid the fan base you have established with this?\\" I am a very open individual with a wide array of different tastes. But this was borderline garbage. Other than, \\"Nine In The Afternoon,\\" I felt like slitting my wrists listening to them. Made me sad. I was expecting so much more.<br /><br />I hope they go back to what made them a success.<br /><br />-Eddie
B001GJOL22|5.0|I have been a RUSH fan since 1980.  Have all of their CD's as well as all of the concert DVD's. Actually started with the \\"Grace Under Pressure\\" Laser and \\"Show of Hands\\" on VHS (Both very well represented on \\"Replay X3\\" DVD).    I, like most other long time fans, have a hard time warming up to the \\"newer\\" music, but still admire the tight musicianship and playing of all their music evolving over time.  I also prefer the \\"studio\\" releases over \\"Live\\" also (least played in my collection is \\"All the Worlds a Stage\\", and \\"Exit Stage Left\\").      I have over the last year \\"upgraded\\" to BluRay and most all I watch (recorded TV, movies, music) is HD.  I was thrilled for the opportunity to complete my collection with this BluRay.  The video is nearly perfect (on my 40XBR4) and the sound (DTS-HD) was excellent as well.    It took several days to make it all the way through, but in the middle there is an intermission that \\"showcases\\" their humor as it is quite goofy.    Just about all the era's are represented with a welcome emphasis on the 80's.  Nowadays alot of people are recognizing the trends and music from then and it really brings me back.      They played quite a bit from \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" cd and while I do like the latest release overall, there are only a couple tracks I really got into (Armor and Sword, and Monkey Business).    Overall, with not much planned for now, this caps off a 38 year career that has them playing and performing better than ever and will have people enjoying it for years and years to come.
1423113497|5.0|I really LOVED this book. This is one of my favourite books.Greek myth lovers, children aged around 10, and just about everyone else should read it.
B000GBEWHA|5.0|thoroughly enjoyed this movie getting ready to see the stage production and now can't wait!  (It's electrifyin'!)
B001IWO870|5.0|I first read the first book in a club. I really enjoyed this book, so I came back for more. Most people should love this book. I would recommened this book for children around 10, greek myth lovers, and just about everyone else.
B000CNFC76|5.0|I rented this on a whim after seeing Stephen Dillane--whose work I've taken an interest in since his fantastic portrayal of Thomas Jefferson in the HBO miniseries \\"John Adams\\"--on the cover. I wasn't sure whether I'd really enjoy it or not, since I've never been much of a golf fan, but I was very pleasantly surprised. The story and characters are engaging and the movie has the usual Disney combination of humor and drama. Dillane's performance as Harry Vardon was great, but Shia LeBeouf also shined in his role as Francis Ouimet. You don't need to be a golf fan to enjoy this movie. I actually liked it so much, I'm planning on buying it now.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|I bought the album after hearing the song \\"Mercy\\" on the radio. I was pleasantly surprised to hear that there were several other great tracks on it. She is a good lyricist and all the songs have the retro sound/feel. A great buy.
0345494768|4.0|As a junkie for this film, I couldn't wait to get my grubby mitts on what promised to be the definitive look at how the whole show went down. The content doesn't disappoint. The interviews, the old script excerpts and the images are all what I had expected and more. The bummer? The book itself. As soon as I opened it I heard the terrifying sounds of a busted spine. I have to hold the damn thing open in a V-Shape when I read it so as to keep the binding from totally giving way. You'd think such a hefty book with such a hefty price tag would be able to withstand the grueling task of being opened up on a table. Oh well, such is life. Fans shouldn't allow this to deter them from such a sacred tome, but be sure to treat it with such reverence and care. I'd hate to see someone fly off the handle and go all Chewie-losing-space-chess on their loved ones because their book fell apart.
0316067601|4.0|This is a fast paced thriller and an incredible true story.  Gives great insight into military operations in Afghanistan.  However, Petty Officer Luttrell's professed love of country apparently doesn't apply to the Bill of Rights in particular freedom of press.  As far as blaming the Rules of Engagement, which by the way were not established soley by the \\"liberal\\" policitians, for his team's demise, perhaps, Marcus should consider the command who sent a team in harm's way outnumbered 35 to 1, SEAL team or no.  Or LT Murphy who accepted a mission without adequate intel on the surrounding terrain.  As a former Naval Aviator and Aircraft Commander in the U.S. Navy, I would have had a difficult time explaining to my superiors why I chose to put a life and death decision to a vote.  What resulted in this instance was a heavy cross of guilt for Petty Officer Luttrell to bear rather than the decision having rested with the senior officer.  I understand SEAL teams are a tight knit group but the Navy assigns an officer to each team for a reason, to make the tough decisions.  An outstanding book but perhaps better told with more passage of time.
B001H5X7KC|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie. Unfortunately, the humour was stupid at best and the movie felt like it was thrown together with little thought
B001MW0J2E|5.0|When I first heard this as a Christmas day leak, I was totally blown away.  A die-hard indie rock fan, I was looking forward to this, especially after drummer Panda Bear's brilliant Person Pitch.  After listening to the vinyl, my initial impression is confirmed and then some.  It all comes together for Animal Collective on this album.  While their other albums are occasionally uneven with spots of definite brilliance, this album has no low points.  With trippy loops building upon each other and simply beautiful Beach Boys-esque harmony, this album is perfect.  It can be whatever you want it to be: a dance record, a rock/pop album, experimental, background music, whatever it is, whatever you want it to be, it is brilliant.  Samples looping and building, melding into gorgeous harmony and reverb-y vocals this album is intimate yet expansive; familiar yet strange. Buy it.

This is a real nuts and bolts survival book that can fit in you pocket or pack.
B00006HAZG|5.0|I am a private tutor who teaches classes in British and American literature, and I have never been so thrilled as when I came across this version of David Copperfield. The Brit Lit classes I teach are surveys, and everyone knows that in a survey class, there's just not enough time to read everything. You kind of have to hit the high points and move on.<br /><br />Which is why excellent video productions of great literature are so much appreciated by me and other teachers. The actual novel David Copperfield is a thick, weighty book; if it were presented in class, the students would have to read it at such a pace, they'd hardly be able to enjoy it. That's where this DVD comes in.<br /><br />This production is absolutely wonderful. The star-packed cast takes the movie forward from the very first scene and does not stop through all of David's joys and sorrows until the lovely happy ending. The sets, scenery and costuming are perfect.<br /><br />Have plenty of tissues available, though, because, like the novel, this movie will move you to both sad and happy tears. Classes will not be bored by this wonderful film, and neither will your family.

B001KMB6X2|3.0|Much like The Spirit, a poorly-written, all-over-the-map misinterpretation of Will Eisner's character, complete with entertaining performances and stunning visuals, Babylon A.D. is a confusing, occasionally dry, very familiar mess with some strong performances and stunning visuals in service of a fairly engaging story. It is not, by any means, a great film. It is also not, by any means, a disaster. I noted that Babylon A.D. has one one-star rating on here, and I think the movie deserves better. I saw the film in theaters, and I was reasonably entertained up until the last five minutes. Not even The Spirit completely lived up to that standard.<br /><br />When films like this come along, I wonder how many people tune out once they've seen a few things they don't like. I am a glass-half-full person. Hundreds of films come out every year, and 90% of them probably have merits that people simply ignore because it's easier to attack the things about them that aren't as sharp. Sure, it borrows from Blade Runner. Movies borrow from other movies. If this was automatically a strike against a film, Quentin Tarantino would have no fans. I personally think Vin Diesel is a fairly charismatic actor (see his recent effort Find Me Guilty for evidence of this), and yet it's like he's got a target on his head. I'm sure some people decided they didn't like this movie just on the basis that he's in it.<br /><br />The \\"Unrated and Raw\\" presentation on DVD does not work miracles on the film. Numerous internet sources claim varying degrees of footage was altered or chopped out of the film, ranging from 15 minutes (since the theatrical cut ran 90m and this runs 103, that's about 15) all the way up to a towering 70m. Admittedly, this ending makes a LOT more sense (which is to say, any sense) than the theatrical ending, although, with apologies to director Mathieu Kassovitz, I liked the hummer chase, presented as a deleted scene on the 2-disc DVD (not to mention in the version without the chase, one set of antagonists just gives up, apparently).<br /><br />For some reason, it's apparently easy to forget that the scale goes from one to five, and the three stars in the middle are more than padding for the first and last ones. I've seen movies that aren't even always in focus. Certainly a movie can become terrible long before it starts to fail on a technical level, but Babylon A.D. is not one of those movies. It's perfectly OKAY, and that's something that deserves some more credit.tagonists just gives up, apparently).

1400063515|5.0|Most of the criticisms of Taleb and this book seem reasonable:<br /><br />- His confidence sometimes seems to reach the level of condescending arrogance.<br /><br />- With a wave of the hand, he dismisses those he disagrees with, even Nobel prize winners.  And perhaps he oversimplifies their positions in order to argue with their straw-man shadows.<br /><br />- He often circles around his points without winding up finally making his points clear.  Is this how a supposedly street-smart guy should talk?<br /><br />- His frequent digressions make it hard for the reader to follow the thread of his narrative, sometimes giving the impression that there actually is no such thread, and that we're just witnessing his stream of consciousness.<br /><br />- One could argue that the more technical chapters are written poorly and are therefore too unclear.<br /><br />- Many of his ideas aren't as original as he seems to imply, so maybe he needs to explicitly give more credit to others.<br /><br />- His suggestions on investing aren't very specific, and one wonders if they rely too much on luck or being rich in the first place.<br /><br />- His references to his anger suggest a need for personal growth.<br /><br />But this book easily deserves 5 stars and its bestseller status.  Why?<br /><br />- Taleb's erudition is undeniable, and a strong case can be made for his iconoclastic brilliance as well.  In a book like this, perhaps the usual modesty and humility wouldn't make sense?<br /><br />- His criticism of his opponents may have more validity than we normally want to admit in polite society.  It's scary to think that economists and others in finance are generally as clueless as Taleb suggests, but recent events seem to have significantly (and unfortunately) vindicated him.<br /><br />- His refusal to get right to the point pushes you to think more deeply about the implications of his ideas, rather than just quickly saying \\"yes, that's obvious, so what?\\"  It's not enough to merely understand something; it has to sink in, in a way that genuinely changes your worldview and approach.<br /><br />- Once you drop your preconceptions of how a book should be written, most of his digressions are fun and many are quite insightful.  For an open-minded person with an intellectual inclination, this can be a tremendously entertaining book (it certainly was for me).  Taleb deploys his own intellect and erudition for us with an unusual frankness which is worthy of our appreciation; instead of being put off by it, enjoy the ride!<br /><br />- I do think the technical chapters are lacking but, alas, it's hard to write a perfect book, especially for an audience with varying technical background.  I think we can cut him some slack here.<br /><br />- His ideas may not be entirely original, but the way he's woven them together and presented them with flourish certainly is.  Ideas need to be communicated to have any value, and Taleb can surely deliver his ideas in a way that has lasting impact on the reader.<br /><br />- This book is about black swans in general, not investing in particular, so let's not get carried away if the book doesn't provide a how-to guide on getting or staying rich.  And Taleb's general advice to arrange safeguards against financial disaster, and also get exposure to potentially huge opportunities, certainly seems sensible.<br /><br />- His anger surprises and even disappoints at first, but one eventually starts to wonder if it might not be at least partly justified.  Things might be worse than we want to believe.  After all, isn't that part of his thesis?  Plus he does end on a very positive note.<br /><br />The bottom line is that this book is truly unique in its ability to intellectually entertain while conveying some deep insight and wisdom.  Few people in the world have the right intersection of ingredients to produce a book like this, so we should cherish the fact that the book exists.  Even if you don't fully agree with him, Talebis worth engaging with.<br /><br />I've read this book in print and also listened to the excellent unabridged audiobook, and I look forward to returning to it at least a few more times in the future.  This book changed my outlook in some fundamental ways, and I think that's about as much as we can hope for with any book.<br /><br />Very highly recommended.  Indeed, don't miss it!<br /><br />Also, for readers who like this book and also have a strong interest in science, I suggest considering [[ASIN:0691021007 Chance and Chaos]] by David Ruelle.to it at least a few more times in the future.

1604591625|4.0|Orthodoxy is an excellent concise explantion of how GK Chesterton came to accept Christianity.  It is essentially autobiographical and offers a set of thoughts and experiences that point toward Chesterton's realization that there is a God, that miracles do happen and that Jesus was God on earth.  It is not a rigorous Apology based solely on logic and argumentation but rather, a collection of ideas that point toward Christianity and away from alternate views of reality.      I found this particular printing of this book somewhat difficult to read possibly due to the the typeface or the line spacing.  I would not recommend this version for anyone with less than stellar reading vision.

B000EWBKKI|2.0|At that time of the theatrical release, a tiny voice told me even then that this was less than the sum of its parts.  That voice was a mere pipsqueak of a thing, looking up at this spectacle of a film, which was so aggressively big, it was like looking up at a tidal wave, breaking over you, with so much of everything crashing down.  Oh, sure, it's got its interesting time-travel premise and the neato liquid-metal terminator.  But foremost, it was an ARNOLD vehicle, with every scene written so Arnold can perform his cooler-than-thou shtick, consisting mostly of catchphrases and lots of destruction while carrying a really loud gun.  All of  those complaints aside, I'm enthusiastic enough about the Blu-ray experience and [[ASIN:B000EWBKKI Terminator 2: Judgment Day [Blu-ray]]] was cheap enough that I thought I'd take another look.<br /><br />Well, I've decided it: Blu-ray or not, it was indeed plumb boring.  People were reduced to cartoon characters Arnold can perform his routines on.  For example, without breaking his stride, he shoots a guard in the knee, then without looking back, cites to John that this stunt remained in strict compliance with John's earlier enjoinder against killing people.  I didn't think it was cute, the deliberate injury to an innocent person presented as a cool joke.  This is not a good movie.  It's not good science fiction; it's not good drama; it's not good comedy.  Remove the flamboyant pyrotechnics and the contrived coolness, and what's left?  ARNOLD, and his terrible acting.  I seriously doubt this movie will be regarded highly by film buffs twenty years from now.<br /><br />As for this Blu-ray edition, the high definition didn't add anything to the experience.  How can it?  It's so full of action, there's no room for anything else that could benefit from a hi-def display.  Any artistry brought to this venture was expended on the pyrotechnics.  The cinematography was efficient and cold, with the simplest aim: to assault the audience with bullets and bombs.  So while it was a noisy movie, there wasn't much to SAVOR visually; not like, say, [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000HEVZ6W Gattaca [Blu-ray]]], sumptuous visual feasts you'll indulge again and again.  If you've already seen it, and you own the SD DVD, there's nothing more for you here on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Nor are there any extras to sweeten the deal.  This Blu-ray edition is indeed a stripped-down affair.  The studio probably threw this together to meet the sudden demand for Blu-ray titles, but you can bet there's a big fat Blu-ray SE coming down the pike.  So to those to whom this matters, you despair is unwarranted.<br /><br />Undoubtedly my strong criticism for this film will garner a lot of angry &#34;no&#34; votes, with the readers clicking the button as if they were slashing my tires.  Be that as it may.  So that my Blu-ray library doesn't become as cluttered as my SD DVD library has become, I gave my copy away to my son.<br />_________________________________________So while it was a noisy movie, there wasn't much to SAVOR visually; not like, say, [[ASIN:B000UBMWG4 Blade Runner [Blu-ray]]] or [[ASIN:B000HEVZ6W Gattaca [Blu-ray]]], sumptuous visual feasts you'll indulge again and again.

0316017922|4.0|I have ready many books in my life and there are only a few which have any 'ah ha' moments for me.  Outliers has one which I like: 10,000 hours. Terry Orlick in 'The Pursuit of Excellence' talks about someone needing a number (a lot) of hours in performing a skill, over and over again, in order to excel at it. Malcolm actually defines it: 10,000 hours. It is a rough guess, but it at least puts a stake in the ground. In researching neuronets and trying to define how many times in which a task or thought needs to be 'practiced' in order for a thought habit to form, I find Gladwell refreshing.  The rest of the book you can keep -- this part was worth the 3 days it took me to read it.
B001GKJ2DO|2.0|I've never seen the original stage version of Mamma Mia and for no other reason that the idea simply didn't appeal to me.  I took a chance on the movie version for one reason and one reason only:  Its cast.  With the possible exception of Pierce Brosnan, I love all of these actors, especially Meryl Streep, Julie Walters, Colin Firth and Christine Baranski, whose previous work I've greatly admired.  This is not so terrible a film as some people have stated.  All I can say to those who love to stamp every movie they don't like with the headline \\"worst film I've ever seen\\" is that frankly, if this inoffensive little concoction is the worst movie you've ever seen, then you're an extremely lucky movie goer, because I've seen some dogs that make Mamma Mia look like \\"A Man For All Seasons.\\"  The main problem I had with this movie was with my own personal inability to separate the songs from the original artist.  To me it was like watching the ultimate chick flick with some pretty bad renditions of ABBA songs used as a narrative device.  If you're not a longtime ABBA fan and are not too familiar with these classic and first rate examples of pop music, it'll probably not make much difference to you who sings them and how they're sung, but in my head I just kept hearing the originals and couldn't help but feel they were the sole glue holding together an otherwise trite and boring story about young love, female camaraderie and rediscovering the joys of love.  To boot, the script is threadbare and makes no impact whatsoever on the viewer.  In short, fantastic songs, badly sung (for the most part) and used in a really mediocre vehicle.  I'll say this though, everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves, the location is awesome and it's a harmless enough little movie that the ladies, especially, will like.  The men, though, will no doubt be rolling their eyes and checking their watches begging to be put out of their misery.  I know I was.  Wholly forgettable in spite of its best intentions and first rate cast.

B001HPP2X2|5.0|As people before me have stated about how good this show is, I'll talk about that briefly.  Dexter Morgan is a blood splatter analyst for Miami PD.  He goes to crime scenes and deciphers the blood for the cops.  He is not a cop however.  The twist of the thing is is that Dexter himself is a serial killer.  However unlike traditional serial killers, Dexter only kills those that have \\"beaten the system.\\"  It's a good take on everything.  Good ethical consideration here.  The series is a 5/5.    Now onto the actual blu-ray.  The video is stunning.  Amazing colors (I've never seen Ocean Drive look any better.)  The audio is what you'd expect; Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Really though, this series does not rely on sound to make it stand out.  The reds are the colors that are really vibrant here.  As far as the extras go-it's got the same extras as the standard DVD release as well as the first episode of season 3 as well as a few other promos for showtime shows.      On the whole, this series as well as the transfer is amazing.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I will have to follow this up with a more extensive VIDEO review, but for now here are the highlights.    1) It arrived on time with free holiday shipping from amazon.com.   I count this as a PLUS.     2) It arrived without protective plastic covering the crystal, case back, crown and pushers, or bracelet.  This is a MINUS.    3) It also arrived with a slight scratch on one of the link-segments on the band. Since it was the polished portion of the link segment, it was very noticeable. ** BIG MINUS **  , but I remedied this by choosing this link segment as the links I would remove when I was sizing the bracelet, so no harm, no foul.     4) The bracelet measures just over 21mm consistently all the way around (no tapering), is solid stainless steel, and has solid end links. The bracelet was erroneously reported by some fellow reviewers as being a 3-link band (two brushed links on the outside and one polished link in the center with a vertical crease).  In sizing the bracelet and moving the links, I quickly learned that it is actually a 4-link bracelet since the polished center is actually made up of TWO links side by side, each with a brushed link on either end (brushed link +polished link+ polished link+ brushed link...per link segment).      5) Diameter of case/bezel  is listed as 42mm (w/o the crown), but it seems to be closer to 40mm.      6) Dial - The dial is protected by a domed Hardlex mineral crystal that does a magnificent job magnifying the fine writing of the EB6 rule, Telemeter, and Tachometer, and all other info including he date on the face/dial.    The domed crystal also does an excellent job reflecting a lot of LIGHT and shimmer towards onlookers, so it tends to get a lot of WOW responses.    7) The bezel is non-ratcheting and bidirectional, has a highly polished coined  edge, and is very solid and smooth in its movement.    8) The weight and balance is just right. It is slightly lighter than the Seiko \\"Monster\\" divers, about the same weight as my Omega 40mm (heavier than a Chase Durer Pilot Commander Alarm chronograph).    9) The alarm (located at the 6 o'clock position) can be used as a GMT to track a secondary time zone. It has its own fully independent minute and hour hands, so this is quite nice.    10) The chronograph second hand (the BIG second hand) and chronograph hour hand (in the small sub-dial nearest to the 12 o'clock position) are in bright yellow. All other hands are in stainless steel with or without lumabrite (luminescent paint for glowing in the dark).  The chronograph sub-dials at 12 and 9 o'clock are outlined in white paint, but the alarm sub-dial a 6 o'clock is nicely outlined with a stainless steel circle/ring.      11) The crown and pushers are all screw down and the threads are well engineered.  This allows not only for the true 200 meter depth water resistance rating, but also keeps dust and moisture out of the watch.  Dust and moisture are the biggest enemies of any watch, regardless of the price-point.    12) ALL the chronograph hands and sub-dials can be manually reset to \\"zero\\" or manually aligned with the hatch marks on the dial or sub-dials using the pushers, if ever needed. I will say that my Seiko SNA411 arrived with all the hands PERFECTLY aligned with the markers, so no adjustment is yet necessary.    Conclusion: This is a dressy watch.  The picture really does not do it justice.  I purchased both this watch, as well as the Chase Durer Pilot Commander Alarm chronograph.  This one for dressier, more formal attire while the Chase Durer for more casual occasions.   Both watches have Japanese quartz movements and respective of style, quality, and function, they are easily on par with or better than most if not all of the other watches in my collection, including several well-known swiss automatics costing $3200 to $4000 each.     The only thing I would change about the Seiko SNA411 is the crystal. This is my first time owning a watch with a Hardlex crystal, and besides my Casio beater watch, all the other watches in my collection have sapphire anti-reflective crystals, which I have never scratched, shattered, or fractured (and I'm pretty hard on my watches...and have occasionally clumsily banged them into walls, door frames, brick walls, etc...).  So I'm anxious to see just how the Seiko's Hardlex crystal holds up, especially given it's domed and slightly protruding form.    BTW - for all those considering automatics, consider this...what I've found out in extensively researching before making my recent purchases:    1) Automatics MUST be cleaned/lubricated/\\"maintained\\" every 2-3 years, which runs anywhere from $150 to $399 for EACH automatic watch....depending on the brand and complication of the movement (basically, the more you paid for the watch the more the jeweler will charge you)    2) Automatics are not even remotely close to as accurate as quartz watches.  Quartz are usually accurate within +/- 5 to 15 seconds a month, whereas automatics are usually +/- 5 to 15 seconds a day (for there best swiss movements).     3) Seiko invented the world's first quartz wristwatch - the 35SQ Astron Watch - in Tokyo on Christmas day,  1969.    4) Quartz movements only require a quick and relatively inexpensive battery change every 2-3 years, some even every 10 years, and if the movements ever get so bad that an overhaul is needed (I've never heard of this happening, but anything is possible), you can buy an entire new movement wholesale from between $30 - $80 and find a friendly jeweler to install it for you.    With one of my better known swiss automatics, before I invested in a watch-winder ($199) to keep it constantly in motion to keep the internal 37-jeweled parts lubricated, it cost me $750 for a complete overhaul when the movement went bad after 4 years.  AND that was DISCOUNTED!!!      It's nice owning swiss automatics (prestige, hype, exclusivity), but not that nice.  After buying one of them, I always have a bad taste in my mouth...like I know I just got ripped off...no matter how much \\"swiss watch-masters hand-made craftsmanship\\" the sales person touted about).   With my two purchases of the Seiko SNA411 and the Chase Durer Pilot Commander, I've never felt so good about a luxury watch purchase.    I'll take a high-quality quartz watch (swiss or japan movement) any day over ANY of my swiss automatics now that I know better.  So go out, find a watch that suits you...enjoy it :-)  I know I will be enjoying BOTH of my latest additions :-)    ***** THE  1-MONTH UPDATE******     THE CRYSTAL:   So far no scratches on the Seiko's SNA411 Hardlex crystal, and that's IMPRESSIVE since I do wear it daily and have banged it into a few things.      THE BAND:  Like I said, I'm pretty hard on my watches. The morning after wearing the Seiko SNA411 during a night on the town (dinner & drinks with friends), I noticed a minor scratch on the stainless steel bracelet.  This is a truly beautiful bracelet, and a GENUINE Seiko replacement bracelet of the exact same make and design runs about $65-$100 (depending on which online retailer you purchase it from), so to prevent further wear and tear on the bracelet during my daily wearing of this watch, AND in an effort to dress it DOWN a bit, I purchased a beautiful 22mm rubber watch band with stainless steel buckle/clasp. The watch is now a thing of elegance + sporty!  I LOVE IT and the number of compliments and gazes have been countless!

0439023483|5.0|Suzanne Collins has single-handed perfected a story that not only leaves you wanting more, but also leaves you really thinking about the content of the story and the characters as well.     Set in a not-so-specified future, The United States is gone and North America has become Panem. Panem is a dictatorship that puts most negative Utopias' to shame. It's dominated by TV, technology, and aestheticism; all of which is ran from a city called The Capitol. Panem is then divided into Districts, at one point there had been 13, but District 13 decided to rebel and was then destroyed because of the rebellion, leaving 12 Districts. That rebellion caused The Capitol to institute The Hunger Games.     The Hunger Games themselves is worse then any reality show ever thought up (it's the product of what everyone else want to do to the Hills'). Each year 24 teenager's names (2 from each District) are drawn lottery-style and those 24 \\"tributes\\" are condemned to be thrown into a gladiator-esque battle to survive. They are thrown into the \\"arena\\" to decide who wins a life on easy street and who loses...their life; those are the only options. All of which is televised big brother-style, betted on, and sponsored.    Katniss Everdeen is our narrator/heroine, the female tribute from District 12, offers herself up when her younger sister's name is called to be another contestant in the next Hunger Games. District 12 is the poorest of all the Districts and hasn't had a winner in 30 years, that winner is now alone, a drunk, and the laughing stock of Panem. The other contestant being the baker's son Peeta, whom she has a growing affection for throughout their time in the \\"arena\\" but is complicated by her affections from her friend and illegal-hunting companion Gale.    The Hunger Games is light on the romance, concentrating more on the Darwinian aspect of surviving the other 23 tributes in the arena. Of course there is enough of the romance that you can't help but wonder, who will Katniss end up with, but the suspense of the chase, the violence, and the controversial nature of the book make it impossible to put down. The Hunger Games is one of the most addicting reads that I have picked up in a long time; it reminds me of the way you'll stay up all night and all day just to beat one of those addictive shooting games, no matter how much you know it's not real even when you're done, you still want more.    Being the first book in a trilogy, some may not want to follow and wait the long wait for the next book or may not want to stick around and see what happens to Katniss, but I know I'm already looking for Amazon to allow me to preorder the next installment in Suzanne Collins' newest story.
B000WQWPKA|1.0|What a joke of a movie, it only got good attendance because of the special affects. It stunk when it came out and it still stinks. Overacting, bad lines, and stupid plot. Example it took 2 weeks to train civilians to be f-18 fighter pilots. Harry Connick Jr is a joke of an actor. Will Smith is over rated and over acts. Like how the alien space craft they hijacked had seats made for humans and not the aliens that have no legs or butts. Terrible movie, but what do you expect from the makers of Godzilla and 10000 BC.
0545128285|5.0|A collection of short stories, The Tales of Beedle the Bard are clever and cute. For fans of Harry Potter, this is a definite read. There's something about the way Mrs. Rowling writes that draws the reader in and is enchanting. If these tales were told by anyone else, I probably wouldn't be interested, but it's a great companion book and very entertaining.

B001EOQWFI|5.0|I don't think I can say it any more than that.. this is most definitely one of THE best movies I and my husband (both over 25-no kids) have seen! We Love it and will continue to watch it regularly for a very long time! If you haven't seen it, get it and keep it! The kids will love it and so will the adults (of all ages). The high-def makes a HUGE difference, we have noticed that with animated videos it's almost like it's 3-D in picture quality! Wonderful addition to our movie collection. Thanks Disney/Pixar-- great job!
031606792X|5.0|This book is a must read.  If you read the first 3 books before this, and liked any of them even just a little bit, then you will love every ounce of this book.  I couldn't read it fast enough.  And for those of you who aren't speed readers, don't let the number of pages scare you off, I have 3 kids, and rarely get the chance to read, but I finished this book in about 4 days.  It was amazing how wrapped up in a book I could get.
0312383320|3.0|I always buy the Stephanie Plum books the day they come out.  This book was no exception and I was able to finish it in about 3.5 hours and I am not a real fast reader.  In the past, I have always found this series to be so funny that I laugh out loud.  (This is the only series that this happens with.)   Although Plum Spooky was amusing at times, I never came close to actually laughing.  The story seemed to drag along and then in the last 20 pages (out of 309) the mystery is suddenly solved.  It was like Janet Evanovich had reached the magic page count and was in a hurry to finish the book.      I will buy \\"Finger Lickin' Fifteen\\" when it comes out because I enjoy the interplay of Stephanie-Morelli-Ranger much more than the books that feature Stephanie-Diesel.
0763631205|5.0|I seemed like it took forever to come but I love it. It was in great condition. The book was well made. I liked the artwork and of course the story.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This is a great movie about a one of the leaders in the early abolishionist movement in England. An outstanding historical film on a true character in history. This film was about as good as Luther.
074356619X|5.0|I was concerned that this would be an audio version of The Secret DVD.  But was pleased that it was much more.  Yes, there were some repeats and lots of quotes from the stars of the movie, but the author adds much commentary and much more detail than was covered in the movie.  I am very glad I bought it.
B00000DHR0|5.0|This seller provided excellent service. Product in excellent condition just as described. Would deffinitely buy from this seller again.
0385512058|2.0|There is little solid advice in this book. The author spends most of the pages talking about himself, his company, his previous company, his very important friends (there are hundreds of them apparently), his parents and....do you see where this is going?   Skip this one.
0823023494|5.0|I must say I absolutely love this book! It shows you how to do exactly what the title of the book says\\" Create characters with personality\\".

B0019EXZYE|4.0|If you like a movie with the good cops/bad cops/robbers/twists and such, this movies got you covered.    My wife and I were pleasantly surprised after I bought this based on a review from [...].  If you are really into Blurays, I'm sure you know this site already, but it's a great resource in my opinion.
B000EWBKKI|5.0|I think this is the best of all of Arnold's movies.  It was directed by James Cameron (director of the Titanic) who's known to be a perfectionist and it shows.  The dialogue and action sequences are sharp, and the movie benefits from the Blu-ray upgrade.  The only downfall of the movie is that it suffers from the unkillable bad guy.  Every time you think he's dead he comes back to life.  That is forgivable, however, because it is a common thread to scary/action type movies.
B001041JKU|5.0|This is the best cd of all time.  I have watched it a number of times and just can't get enough of it.  Each number is just great.
B0018CWEYY|4.0|As with most television programs in the 2007/2008 season, \\"Lost\\" was broadcast in an abbreviated format (13 episodes). Given the continuity difficulties in dealing with multiple story lines, and the well-documented and convoluted plot line, Season 4 of \\"Lost\\" managed to maintain its own high standards relative to quality and story activities. This was achieved despite the inherent difficulties created by the shortened television season created by the writer's strike. True to form, it seemed that for every plot item that was resolved, two new questions were raised. Although the overall story often borders on the absurd, enjoying this series remains an exercise in suspending reason in order to simply sit back and enjoy the ride. The viewer's enjoyment of \\"Lost\\" can be traced to the production values and the overall strength of the cast, which are both uniformly high. If you haven't seen Season 4 yet, get it now and watch it all: Season 5 is about to begin.
9562911640|5.0|My comments are based on the original book, not any re edits or revised editions.  If you look online, you should be able to find an ebook of Charles Hannel's original for free, since the book is over 75 years old it is in the public domain. Personally I spend all day in front of a computer, so it's nice to take a break and read an actual physical book, and I like to circle, highlight and write on.    This book is incredible, I think this was probably \\"the secret\\" original edition since it was introduced in 1903, predating napoleon hill and  several others.  TO my knowledge this is the first book that mentions the \\"law of attraction\\" but it mentions several other laws as well. Although Prosperity through thought force    You could honestly come up with probably a chapter of material if you took each key point and went into detail describing it. But the information in this book is absolutely compacted to the max, no fluff at all. Honestly you could spend a long time just thinking about each section.  Unfortunately because it goes and lists everything, I know that some people will not find it a book that you can read through.  This is one that although it makes sense, it isn't an easy read.  There's just so much information to take in, that most people will have difficulties reading it.  It isn't like chewing through a hard to swallow think hide meat though, it's more like very rich dessert that you want to savor.    But although it's a difficult book, this is still probably the best book I have ever read in my life. It's amazing that a book can have such deep profound information locked into every chapter.  I read this prior to viewing \\"The Secret\\", and was actually very disappointed in the secret because it simply doesn't do the law of attraction justice.  I haven't even finished this book yet because I like to absorb my time and take it in.  If you put all the success books out there together, you will still probably have more information in this one.  I love how it actually logically and factually explains the law of attraction, and explains through the cause and effect how it all works.  Seriously, if you are thinking about getting this book get it.  If you don't want to pay for it, search for it google and download it.  Here's a couple google searches  \\"Master Key system\\" filetype:doc (will find a word document version)  \\"Master Key system\\" filetype:pdf (will find a pdf version)  print it if you'd like otherwise read it online.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I received this DVD in its original packaging. Thanks so much!
1416562605|5.0|White Tiger is a powerful book masked in the form of amusing satire. The novel consists of a series of letters written by the unnamed author of the letters to a powerful minister from China who is about to visit India. He wishes to inform the dignitary about the real India rather than the carefully scripted tour Indian officials will provide.  As he reveals the truth about his country he tells the story of his own life and his mecurial rise from a very poor boy to a powerful entrepreneur who has used criminal means to reach his success. The book is funny, honest and a brutal description of what life in Indian--a democracy--is like compared to China where no democracy exists. I read White Tiger in two days. It was hard to put the book down.
1416905014|5.0|I bought this book for my grown daughter for Christmas.  She Loves it...  It is so beautiful...  She can share the story with her girls,  As it was our favorite book to read before bed when she was growing up...
0307269752|5.0|I had never heard of this novel when I received it, although it has been a bestseller all over Europe. I had a long plane ride from Seattle to Tokyo and needed a long book to get me through it. What a delightful surprise this novel ended up being. I fell in love with the characters, especially Salander, the girl with the dragon tattoo. I didn't sleep on the plane because I couldn't put the book down. It is filled with scandals, politics, computer hacking, and murder. I am usually good about guessing endings to novels and I was surprised at the ending. I can't wait until the other two in the trilogy are translated into English.
B001JOIEZ4|5.0|I love the lyrics in all the songs. And I think this soundtrack exposed me to a lot of new artists that I now thrilled to have discovered. Paramore's sound rocks and though I knew of Iron and Wine before, this song makes me want to dance in the moonlight under stars just like the movie :)
B001EOQWEO|5.0|I love this movie. It is good for kids of all ages that just like a good clean movie.
1433502453|5.0|This Bible has it all! Color Maps, charts, good study notes, detailed outlines, a handy concordance, cross refs, timelines, a mini Biblical Doctrine Overview (not a exhaustive systematic theology textbook), a mini guide to major religions and cults in the back, history of salvation in the OT verse guide in the back, and so so much more!! This is the most outstanding Bible I have ever used!<br /><br />I previously owned the Reformation Study Bible but was not impressed with the study notes, and other helps in the book, so hopefully someone will buy that one. I also own a Zondervan NIV Study Bible which is quite nice and was previously the most advanced study Bible I had used.<br /><br />My only gripe(s) about this Bible are as follows.<br /><br />1. Text is in 1 column instead of the traditional 2 column format for Bibles.<br />2. Words of Christ are not in Red<br />3. Size<br /><br />None of these gripes are enough to deduct a star, just hopefully CrossWay will also release a condensed ESV Study Bible and leave the rest of the stuff online, or for those wishing the bigger study Bible. The words of Christ NOT in red will take some time getting used too, but hence the advantage is that no one can read the Bible and argue that only Christs words are inspired.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I bought this item for my daughter for Christmas. The packaging for the item was very nice. It was all put into an album and each disc was in a seperate pocket. It was almost like a CD holder but nicer. My daughter was impressed with how nice it looked.

B001O9BB3G|5.0|I loved this book. I was glad to read it on my Kindle. Nice to read stories of GBL Women of color. Well done. The story was slow in the beginning, but it picked up, and I didn't want it to end. Maybe there'll be a sequel ;)
B000MNP2KI|4.0|PLOT  In this prequel-style instalment, a young James Bond is promoted to \\"00\\" status and deployed on various missions; some physical, some cerebral, some emotional.    REVIEW  To me, there's the first three Connery films - more thrillers than action films - all of them deserving credit. Then there's all the dated and boring entries spanning the ensuing 30 years, with only the very occasional exception. And then there's Daniel Craig and his Casino Royale. The real James Bond has kindly stood up.     There are at least two sequences that I will always remember from this film. The first precedes the opening credits, where Bond \\"earns his stripes\\"; the second is where he overcomes an attempt on his life whilst playing poker. I cannot go into these exquisite moments in any more detail because I'll ruin the film for those who haven't seen it.    Of course, for the explosion fanatics, there are plenty of heavy-duty action scenes worthy of note, especially one taking place at Miami airport. For the torture scene, I was hoping for the thing that the Chinese do with water droplets, but I wasn't let down too badly...    It's great to see they've trashed the \\"Q\\" and/or \\"R\\" characters, and Moneypenny, and that stupid character played by Robbie Coltrane, and given all such residual screen time to Judi Dench's \\"M\\" and the new Felix Leiter (played understatedly by Jeffery Wright).  They've also eased-up on the mindless \\"nightcap\\" affairs. Instead, one core emotional encounter comes slowly into focus, and we finally get a glimpse at why Bond became the way he is.    SPECIAL MENTIONS  Daniel Craig for Acting.

B0015OKWL2|4.0|Two veteran cops, Turk and Rooster (Robert De Niro, Al Pacino) work to solve a string of murders in which the victims are criminals that they have previously arrested and have been acquitted of their crimes.  Something's seems a bit fishy, at least that's what two younger cops, Detectives Riley and Perez (Donnie Wahlberg, John Leguizamo) start to think.  Furthermore, they suspect it's a cop.  Anyway you splice it, the decorated members of the NYPD are looking for a killer.  One who leaves a bit of poetry at every scene and happens to murder the filth of society that has slipped through the cracks of the judicial system.    \\"Righteous Kill\\" is only a slightly above average thriller given the big name talent.  De Niro and Pacino both put forth great performances; De Niro as the hot headed, do whatever it takes to get a conviction cop and Pacino as a much calmer, honest detective.  It seems a bit cliché, the whole good cop bad cop, but nonetheless it worked well and the duo's performances were very well balanced to convey not just an occupational partnership, but also a friendship.  While the film will leave the audience thinking they know all the answers within the first twenty minutes, the plot does take some interesting turns.    It's great to see the two legendary actors are still performing.  \\"Righteous Kill\\" is not completely predictable nor is it unwatchable.  Give it a try.
B000NQBLKY|5.0|The markets operate reflecting the wisdom of collective thought. Individuals lack the ability to know everything, even though, they believe they do. When a trend is detected in the market and interference is made to take advantage of that trend, the market will adjust to that trend and create an entirely new outcome rather than the one expected. When the market is allowed to operate freely, more freedom is created, which allows the collective thought to have many more solutions to an immediate problem. When the individuals manipulate the market and rely on additional converts to help solve the problem, the market will not agree, because all the solutions are not being presented to cause equalibrim. The perceived \\"smart\\" individuals eliminate the opposite side of equalibrium, sometimes ruthlessly, causing all perceived unfair markets to act even more unfairly. Free markets reflect those aspects that can bring about the greatest justice, even though, pain and pleasure will take place. This causes the self-interest of more people to contribute more solutions by those who feel their survival(self-interest) is better achieved. Capitalism allows charity to work. You cannot legislate it, because the self-interest of the free market allows a more equitable distribution of those things that individuals believe to be in their best interest.

0545128285|5.0|Since my daughter has long since finished the last book in the Harry Potter series she has frequently longed to once again loose herself in the world of Hogwarts.  While this was, obviously not a new tome about Harry, Ron and Hermione, it did feed that desire in some way.  It was a quick little read that left her once again longing for more Harry, but she was thrilled to have answers that \\"explained a lot from \\"Deathly Hallows.\\"
B001DJ7PN2|5.0|Kevin Costner is brilliant as the New Orleans DA whose conscience wouldn't allow him to ignore the evidence of a conspiracy in the death of J.F.K.    It took courage to make this movie. It even takes a little courage to watch it. In fact, it is a movie about courage. I highly recommend watching this movie if you want to rediscover your own.
0956010903|5.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard Collector's edition is a wonderful book to own, especially for diehard Harry Potter fans (like my Dad and I). Yes it is $100, but every penny/dollar is worth it for those who truly adore the Harry Potter Universe. It was a thrill to read the book that helped Harry, Ron, and Hermione on their journey in the seventh book. One of my favorite parts was reading the commentary by Albus Dumbledore after each tale. The commentary gave great insight to the story and some of the smaller details of the universe, such as why Mr. Lucius Malfoy wanted to get Dumbledore evicted as the Headmaster of Hogwarts, and being introduced at least a little bit to Malfoy's ancestor, Brutus Malfoy.  This is a wonderful book to own, although I would not recommend buying this book if you are not a diehard fan, if you feel you just want to read the tales than you can buy the regular book at many bookstores near you for a far cheaper price. But for those who will really enjoy the small details in the commentary then I really recommend this book to you.

B00168OINK|5.0|This disc has great audio and visual.  Great film for kids as well as adults.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm assuming, since actual Easy Company members speak about related experiences in the opening of each episode, that this series is based on fact - with the usual special effects, embellishments, and secondary storylines thrown in that make for a good TV show or movie. I figure, if the Easy Company members don't object to any \\"mistakes\\" that are made, why the heck should I? However, if you're the kind of person who can't enjoy a show for what it is, preferring to pick everything apart in search of flaws, you'll probably find lots wrong with this one, too. Personally, I found it thoroughly enjoyable and highly recommend it. I'm retired from a military that is NOT American and I still like this series very much. Imagine that...
0316067598|1.0|I admire the author and his fellow soldiers for their courage and for their service. But it's the book, and not their actions, decisions, or anything else which is being reviewed - and that's the reason why it really can't receive anything but a very low mark.<br /><br />As a piece of writing and a historical account, this book is really difficult to take seriously. I really wish the author had chosen to have his story told objectively by an experienced military writer or war historian. As is, it really reads like something out of Team America.<br /><br />The book's biggest failing is that it's too politicized. His anger toward and mistrust of people with opposing political or religious views is halting, and clouds his objectivity. I also think it's fine that he loves God, Bush, and Texas - I just couldn't help wishing it was conveyed or explained in a more interesting or compelling way.<br /><br />The book is also full of contradictions that are never even superficially explored. For example, his decision to shift blame for their release of the goat herders to \\"G** damn liberals\\" and the \\"left-wing media\\" runs contrary to his admission that it was actually the Christian (as opposed to the military) side of his brain which told him to let the herders go. So the reader is left to sort it out: Was it his Christian conscience and his faith in God, or a cowering fear of Rush Limbaugh's tired old caricature of \\"left wing liberal elites\\" ready to persecute him on his return which forced his hand and caused him to vote \\"let em' go\\"?<br /><br />Contradictions and poor prose aside, I think the author could have easily avoided politicizing a story which at the heart of it has nothing to do with politics. I've already mentioned Team America, but I think it's appropriate to have this film in the back of your mind if you want to dive into this book. Avoid the temptation to read lines aloud to the laughter of friends and colleagues, as one reviewer admitted to doing. The clich&eacute;s start early and don't ever really end.<br /><br />I would look forward to reading an objective, detailed account of what these brave men encountered - as well as a follow-up on the investigation into what went wrong. The author makes no attempt to discuss the obvious problems with mission planning, which was the reason they all had a bad feeling about this mission from the word \\"go\\".<br /><br />But questions linger: How could it be that their years and years of careful training hadn't prepared them for the eventuality of encountering bystanders or civilians while involved in a special operation? Why were they so utterly confounded by what one would think was a foreseeable scenario? Or at least not an implausible one. Yet when they encountered the herders they were so unsure of what to do that they contemplated murdering them, and then eventually tried to radio operations for \\"advice\\".<br /><br />Again, it's even more surprising given the author's early reservations about the mission itself and the degree to which they would be exposed due to a lack of cover. I am not pretending to know more about special operations or anything else military related for that matter - I would defer to the author any day of the week on these matters. Still, a careful reader can't help but wonder why there were no routines or protocols in place for what was a pretty predictable scenario.<br /><br />I have to say I don't enjoy slamming the work of anyone, much less that of a true patriot, but I wish he'd had a better ghost writer or mentor - or a publisher wise enough to have brought in an experienced war writer and Pulitzer Prize winner such as Rick Atkinson. The result might have done the author's incredible story better justice.<br /><br />***<br />Reviewer's note: I consumed this via audible. I don't think the reader helped this book, and in retrospect I think this review is more harsh as a result. I can say with very little doubt that I would have enjoyed this more had it notbeen read to me by this particular actor. Still, my problems with the content and style of writing remain.style of writing remain.
B001GQSY64|5.0|If you go into this new addition to the Star Wars universe with an open mind and a decent sense of the target demographic this movie was created for, you will undoubtedly have a great experience.  I purchased this mainly for my 3 1/2 year old who absolutely loves all things Star Wars (much like his father!) and my expectations were that it was going to be a fun movie that doesn't take itself seriously. I was not disappointed and ended up loving the movie and the entirely new chapter of the Star Wars saga that is virtually limitless.  While the characters don't engage in strong philosophical or intellectual debate, they do show some depth and do a good job of fitting into what we have come to expect from Star Wars dialogue - in fact, in some ways, it's even better than the prequels. The story is good for all audiences and the action is very fast-paced and engaging. Plus, the visuals on Blu Ray just make it that much more of  a treat.    Yes, our beloved Star Wars is getting older with the years, but that doesn't mean we can't accept change that is meant to catapult our obsession to a new generation of viewers. The time frame in the Star Wars universe is  one that is ripe for some intriguing stories and action-packed adventures, exploring characters and places that we have long wondered about. The animated series on Cartoon Network has been a real treat as well and I, for one, am very excited about the potential of this series.

031606792X|5.0|I am so glad that I did not start reading this series until just before Breaking Dawn was released.  I don't think that I could have stood the wait. Did not start to even read the series until July of 08. I was not going to stoop to women's romance novels.  I am a nurse and started to see my co-workers reading Twilight and the others books.  These women were mature, sensible and educated.  Was told that the books were awesome and that I should read 'em.  I have NEVER cared for romance novels because I am crusty and have to keep up the facade of being unsentimental.  Finally caved and bought the first book Twilight, thinking \\"I am a lemming, but if I keep my mouth shut no one will know.\\"      Fortunatly by the time I started the next book, New Moon, Breaking Dawn was just being released.  My mom and my sister finished all 4 of my books before me. (Somebody has to go to work!)  It's been hard to keep my mouth shut since reading the first book.  So much for pretense.      The romance is awesome because it shows that the spark can be enhanced without giving into the physical until it is the right place with the right person at the right time.  It's nice to see the ideals of many depicted in print.      The resolution to the Edward and Bella story in this book does not feel finished in that they live happily ever after.  Once Nessie matures in about 7 years I have a feeling there will be alot more story to tell.  I Hope!!!    I have reccommended this series to many who all share the same excitment.  Have even re-read all 4 books and enjoyed them more the 2nd time around.  Action, romance, characters that you think about when you are not reading the books. I think I am addicted. Thank heavens it is legal, non-fattening and moral.
B000HC2LI0|4.0|I was always a big fan of \\"The West Wing\\" and had been waiting for the DVD collection of the series to come out.  The price, however, proved to be prohibitive ($200 plus dollars).  Thanks to the great deals on Amazon on Cyber Monday, I was able to purchased the series for about half the price.  The box set is, to say the least, sturdy in its construction.  The design is attractive - a nice shade of blue that does not scratch easily.  Finally, the shows are great - it's nice to be able to see the changes in the characters over time.    If I have any complaint, it would have to be that the Special Features are a little light for such a large collection.  The normal extras such as director and writer commentary are there but no real surprises - like how much the just ended Presidential race mirrored the series (Santos = Obama, Vinick = McCain).    Overall, a great purchase.
0810979772|4.0|I got thei for my 9 yr old for christmas, and he loved it.  I was upstairs getting some cleaning done when he enters he asks, \\"Can i ask you a series of questions? \\" and he goes on and on about the neat questions asked in the book.  He shared brining it over others houses and we all had a laugh with the answers.  Love all the diary books, they got my very active outdoorsy oldest son to actually finish a book!
034544678X|5.0|This is an excellent book by someone who really knows and loves dogs. The author is highly trained and experienced in the field of animal behavior and writes with heart. You will find it a very readable, enjoyable, and informative book. As a dog trainer myself, who has read many books on the subject of dogs, training, and animal behavior this is the one I always recommed. Whether you are thinking of getting a dog, or already have one or more dogs, this book will enlighten and help you to be your dog's best friend.
B0010YPTGU|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my husband to test out his surround sound.  This is an amazing DVD and great for testing systems.  Not to mention that you cannot go wrong listening to Andrea Bocelli.
1407109421|5.0|I had watched the Blu-ray version of The Golden Compass and liked it a lot. That prompted me to buy the original books, especially since the second and third books were not going to be made into movies. I certainly wasn't disappointed! As I said in the title, I had a hard time putting it down even though the three novels in this omnibus edition were over 1000 pages long.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|Everything I wanted to know about this product was listed on the site.  I wanted this season brand new.  So I purchased it \\"New\\".  When i received it, it arrived in PERFECT condition!
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Excellent DVD for Floyd fans. Takes you back to 70's and 80's with music flow.
0064430227|5.0|There are some novels that you pick up and just can't put down. Harold and the Purple Crayon is a page turner in an adolescent way. It's just too much fun, and at 64 page count it's a novel for toddlers. There are elements of surprise, suspense, humor and adventure, you turn the page just to find out what happens next. This classic story flows like water with no interruptions. It's no surprise that after 50 years this book is one of the best selling children's books.
B00005QB42|5.0|My yoga teacher in Boulder used tracks from this CD extensively in his yoga classes.  I am so happy to have stumbled upon this CD!  It quiets the mind guides you to an amazing place whether your practice is yoga, or quiet contemplation.
0810979772|5.0|Our sons are 8 and 9 years old.  They love all the Wimpy Kid books.  My wife and I get a chuckle out of them too.
0545128285|1.0|I am sure that I am not the only Harry Potter fan to register my dispointment with this \\"book\\". It consists of a series of fairy tales the were told to young witches and wizards. While in the fictional world of Hogwarts this book may have served some nostalgic purpose, for us muggles it simply was too short, too simple, too boring and too banal. I think non Harry Potter fans will enjoy it more than those of us that have made JK Rowling super rich.
B000NZL268|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this game and would recommend it to everyone who loves playing games!  It is mentally challenging, fun for all ages (my 5 year old daughter loves it), and lights the competitive spirit that makes games so fun!
B001GQ2TGA|3.0|Great background music over the holidays.  Only one or two recognizable Christmas songs, and some of the other songs sound like previous Enya songs with different words.  I am glad I bought it and listened to it on my mp3 player over the holidays.
B001ER4CSO|5.0|This is a really fun movie. It's rare that a sequel is better than the original, but this one is. Hellboy is such a sympathetic character and the fairy antagonists are beautifully dangerous. This movie is absolutely one of the best from the comic genre. It is a great ride.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This was an impulse buy that turned out to be the hit of the holiday.  Everyone from age 6 to 65 played it over and over.  It is a great thought-provoking game of strategy.
6301247485|5.0|This product arrived to me in  a timely fashion. The quality was great. I really appreciated the time and care which went into shipping this object. Thank thank you many times over.
B001EL6EHC|1.0|The most enticing part of the advertising hype was scenes not used and outtakes.  The latter was almost non existant and the former had no sound track.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|the movie \\"Halloween\\" doesn't need an introduction.  It was a huge hit when it was released and spawned several sequels.  It has influenced just about every horror movie that has come after it (in one way or another).<br /><br />it didn't need to rely on a lot of special effects or buckets of blood to terrify you.  The atmosphere, music, and shadowy lighting were enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />Also, the relationship triangle of Michael, the Jamie Lee Curtis character, and Dr. Loomis was very dynamic on many levels, and rich psychologically.<br /><br />John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\" is also a must-see for horror fans.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|The quality and talent of Enya is displayed beautifully in her special Christmas collection.  My children are mesmerized and left speechless when her music plays.  This CD is very soothing and a great alternative to traditional Christmas music.
B000M341QE|5.0|This and the movie it was based on are some of the best gangster movies ever made. I think this movie has revived the genre that has largely been stagnating as of late. Everyone's performance is amazing. This and the Godfather are the two best gangster movies ever made.
B001DPHDCY|4.0|Bought it as for the kids - grown ups enjoyed it too.  A movie that is good for any kids movie collection.
B000E41MS6|5.0|I would never watch the original BBC series with my husband, who is a Dr. Who fanatic but, I love this series.  Christopher Eccleston and Billie Piper are superb together.  Great fun!
B000063UR2|5.0|It makes it feel more mythical than the cheesy 80's rock version that I saw when I was younger. Don't worry the old one is still on there if you want to hear it.
1433502410|5.0|I have read through the ESV One Year Bible for the past 5 years and have been impressed with this essentially literal translation.  I have been even more impressed with the ESV Study Bible.  I use it along with the NIV Study Bible.  This Bible is well worth the money.
B001GZ6QBU|1.0|The amount of violence in this film is disturbing for anyone, let alone the PG-13 designation. I expected comic book violence in the film, but I was appalled at the mass destruction and menace that smacks of terrorism, and haven't we had enough of that? Is this what the creator of Batman intended?     Moreover, while the plot of choosing good over evil is admirable, I  feel that the sub-plot of masking good as evil for the sake of the  order, is manipulative and dishonest. Sure it's a good ploy for setting  up future Batman films, but it's merely setting the stage for more of  the same old stuff. How much violence and bad-boy heroes do we really need  to be entertained?
B0019FOC5E|5.0|If you loved the movie then this CD is a wonderful addition to any music selection. I actually gave this CD to my 86 year old grandmother for Christmas. Believe it or not but she won't take the thing out of her car cd player. She listens to it everywhere she goes. Highly suggest anyone who loves musicals to purchase this. Age makes no difference as I have pointed out here.
6305971935|5.0|Actually, I wasn't expecting too much from this little film.  But, it surprised me.  I actually got involved with these young people and cared what happened to them.  Perhaps, because of today's non-stop action films I liked this one as it allowed me to breath a little and enjoy the flow of events.  While this isn't a riveting film, it is entertaining and leaves you feeling good.  I'd recommend it for all except toddlers.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|This item arrived earlier than I expected and in excellent condition!!!  Thank you for making my Chirstmas shopping a pleasant one!!!  God bless!!!
B00177Y9ZC|2.0|OK, OK, I know this is just another preposterous action sci-fi film, but for such an interesting premise to end up going nowhere, I have to say, don't waste your money and watch this on cable. The film is fast paced, but for a film that clocks in at under an hour and a half, it felt very long. This might have played better as a TV episode of some random sci-fi series.<br /><br />The film does say a lot about our society though as with such an amazing and powerful gift, all these lunkheads could think to do is rob banks and steal cars...etc! It's pure fantasy and that's OK by me, but make it a little more interesting next time. The film may appeal to some, but for anyone who wants a little more out of their sci-fi movies, this one's a dud!  Even Lane and Jackson can't save this one!
1416562605|4.0|This book is hilarious. It is witty, with the narrator using contemporay language to make fun of rich people, politics, urban life and even Muslims (who I hope will take no offense). The book is a quick read because it is easier to understand than other Booker award-winning books. The book has no plot as such, with no twists in the story that will surprise you. The only unsatisfying element of the book is the murder of Mr Ashok (don't worry, this is not a spoiler as the author reveals it right at the start of the book) because he is such a likeable character who is polite, and treats the narrator so well inspite of him being the servant.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|This has become my favorite Christmas cd. I am very picky about my christmas music, I listen to every year. This is one I will keep in the cd player for years to come.  The music and voice of an angel.
0525950079|1.0|I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" during the Summer 1991; its plot and characters bled into my life that summer.  I carried them around no matter where I went.  I so LOVED this novel.  When \\"World Without End\\" came out, I was delighted, but decided to wait for the paperback (reading a hardbound book that size in bed is challenging).  Anyway, as I nestled into bed during the Christmas holidays, I began the novel with high expectations.    Alas, what a disappointment.  The writing is humdrum and poor.  The author had to keep explaining the characters' motives and the responses to them.  Does he consider his readers to be totally stupid?  His sentence structure was so very boring.  The plot was like a TV miniseries:  perhaps enticing, but lacking depth.  Godwyn became more shallow as he became more evil.  Ralph was a cardboard, one-dimensional character.    I could go on and on about my complaints.  Suffice it to say: Shame on this author.  I think that Follett was \\"stuffing the novel\\" to make his deadline and collect his money.  He left this reader utterly unimpressed.
B001EN71DG|5.0|I GAVE THIS TO MY SON AND GRANDSON FOR CHRISTMAS, AND THEY LOVE IT.  GREAT PRICE AND SUPER FAST SHIPPING.
0142405787|5.0|I am a big fan of this series and an even bigger fan to quality online shopping.
0394826817|5.0|I have used other books to teach my 3 yr old manners (such as Dora's Book of Manners etc) however this book has really helped my son understand much more than just \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\". The book even goes into \\"whining pests\\"! It is great.
B000W91RUG|5.0|Started watching at the end of first season so had to buy dvd to catch up on what I missed. Great show.
B0000X61VE|5.0|I have NO IDEA what the Amazon review means by this workout being dangerous! I used this workout when I was 11 years old or so with my best friend (hey I live in Orange County, we are body concious at a ridiculously young age!!!) Even then, it was SAFE and fun! Now at age 27, I have been using it again and still enjoy the workout!     I run 5x a week and am in good shape. For those days that I am unable to go for a run, I'm thankful that in a pinch I can pop in this DVD and get a good workout!     I HIGHLY recommend this DVD! I do agree that one should watch their form when doing lunges and squats, but this is true of any workout.     I also use Cindy Crawford's Next Challenge DVD for variety, but this is a classic that I love!!!!
B001BPJJ9G|4.0|The scenery is gorgeous, and the movie is surprisingly funny. The story is not very strong, at times sounding like a children's book (though it is a bit on the dark side for kids), but it is a delight to watch. The costumes, the locations, and the scenes are all so beautiful. It's definitely not a mainstream movie, but if you like visual decadence this movie is a must-see.
B00079ZACM|5.0|One of the greatest battle scenes ever filmed.  Unfortunately,they don't make movies like this anymore.  The color, acting, story and depth of the film are outstanding
B001E75QH0|5.0|THe item came in the time it was supposed to and was in perfect shape
045122499X|4.0|This was a good book, well written and able to keep my interest. I must confess that I enjoyed Pillars of the Earth better, but this was still very well done.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This movie is great and very much worth the money.  The only thing my husband and I didn't really like is the total length of the film.  And honestly, we thought Iron Man was more all-around entertaining.  The Dark Knight is exactly that - dark.  The Joker is fantastic - almost (dare I say) Shakespearean in his madness and smarmy-ness.  He's the most fun to watch.  It's not at all a kids' movie (young kids anyway).  I say buy it; each time you watch it you find something more and the entertainment is well worth the cash.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|With sequels there's always something lost... and it's never as good as the first one... this sequel was.  I loved hellboy but I also love hellboyII.  If you havent seen it... do it...
B000002ADT|5.0|Jazz. Yeah! Real.  Way it Should Be. Does what it Should Do. Love playing this instant Soother of what the heck ever.  What? Don't even remember!<br />This IS What Music should do.<br />I LOVE this!<br />Original release date 1959.  Amazon Sale Rank today #81.<br />Get it.  Play it.  Relax, be happy and..<br />Soar!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|After letting this movie digest for a while after all the hype, I thought I could make an honest review to the best of my ability.  I'll break it down into 2 parts: the movie and the blu-ray.<br /><br />The Movie<br />I've watched The Dark Knight 4 times now and it still doesn't disappoint.  It has taken the comic book genre and the Batman series to another level.  The standout performance obviously is Ledger, in an unforgettable performance that will definitely stay with you days or even weeks after.  This is the joker's movie.  I can still hear his catchy little quotes in my head (\\"Why so serious\\", \\"Here weeeeee go\\", etc.).  He has left us with gift and I'm sure his career was only going to get better.  What a tragedy.<br /><br />Bale slightly edges out Keaton as Batman, but I preferred his performance better in Batman Begins, which offers much more depth to the character.  Be of the rich plot and excellent action sequences, TDK is a better movie, but Begins is a better \\"Batman\\" movie.<br /><br />Overall, this is the best movie of the year...quality acting and an epic story.<br /><br />The Blu-ray<br />There is a lot of controversy among HD fans about the use of edge enhancement (EE) on this transfer.  On my Panasonic 42\\", it looks flawless.  The aspect ratio changes do not hinder the experience but only add to it.<br /><br />The thing that is lacking the most is the special features.  No true behind the scenes featurettes, no Ledger tribute, and no behind the scenes footage of his performance for that matter.  A total letdown.  I'm sure these additions will be available on the inevitable double-dip.
B0018CWEYY|3.0|It is fun if you can figure out if you are in the past, present or future.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie loses nothing after being transferred from the big screen to the small.  Heath Ledger's Joker is just as poisonous as in the theater and his talent stands out throughout the movie.  I really hope he gets the Oscar.    Christian Bale's Batman is not only the dark crusader with a mission, but he is also portrayed as very vulnerable, very human, even to the point of wishing to pass the \\"mantle\\" to another potential crime fighter.  Bravo!
1589944607|5.0|This is not a little child's gift item; it's for boardgame junkies who can play complex games based on the series.  The recipient (26 years old) was delighted with it.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|To avoid redundancy, I will not provide a comprehensive analysis of [[ASIN:B0010AN7Z4 The Apartment (Collector's Edition)]]. A great many reviewers here on Amazon.com already have written such excellent critiques of Billy Wilder's entertaining farce.  My two cents, then, mostly will deal with the movie's portrayal of working women and its exploration of their inner lives.<br /><br />The Apartment was released in 1960, and in nearly half a century some things remain the same when it comes to matters of the heart.  Well, when the four chambers belong to the female of the species, that is.  Although we chicks have made head-turning advancements in the workplace, now and then smashing through the glass ceiling like the underpaid stuntwomen that we are, some broads (present company excepted) still fall for the tricky quick steps of boardroom merengue.  Instead of acting as if they have two left feet, these sisters should be kneeing the bossman's twins and asking for a raise while he hits the highest note in his career.  Forty-nine years after The Apartment: same dance, same aria.<br /><br />Thus, every time I watch the scenes of awkward intimacy between Shirley MacLaine's Miss Kubelik and Fred MacMurray's Mr. Sheldrake, I get onion eyes.  And every time I listen to Edie Adams warn MacLaine -- secretary to elevator operator -- about those \\"ringydingdings,\\" I get a lump in my throat as wide as a boulder blocking love's highway.  Now, I have watched The Apartment more than 15 times since my first viewing on cable's TCM channel and subsequently on video, so those are a lot of lumps.  But then something wonderful happens:  Lovable, lonely loser C.C. Baxter (Jack Lemmon in impeccable form) lightens the mood with a spasmodic facial mannerism, piercing the air with his trademark cackle curtailed by his own hyperstressed pronouncements.  Only then can I swallow, breathe and chuckle the hurt away.<br /><br />Such is the power of great acting and masterful direction, anchored by a superb script.  Through Wilder's film lens, viewers get to study the contours of hearts that have been broken, barely mended, only to be fissured again.  However, considering all of the impersonal technology in homes and offices today, who's to say that the alienation as personified by Fran Kubelik's and C.C. Baxter's circumstances is more profound?  Suited saber-toothed tigers in fedoras carrying little black books have evolved into savvy Bluetoothed cybercats with mobile phones that have roaming charges and unlimited space for all those \\"purrsonal\\" contacts.<br /><br />Just as anti-corporate cynicism has endured into the 21st century, so has The Apartment -- easily one of Billy Wilder's finest satires.  The movie should be required viewing at hedonistic office parties to remind everyone, especially the male of the species, about the tragic consequences of shredding business ethics for the purpose of getting down to business on a desktop or in a restroom stall.  Or, could it be that the working stiff's lustful goals have turned so absurd that an accidentally flushed BlackBerry is considered more serious than a few *lodged* staples and paper clips?  Oh my.<br /><br />Sexual pathos aside, the comedy of C.C. Baxter's apartment situation is first-rate.  He's a lucky so-and-so to pay less than market rate (even for 1960!) for his immense square footage.  Nevertheless, he has what we urbanites today call a revolving-door apartment.  Only, he's the one who keeps leaving!  As attached as I am to my apartment, I sense his misery each time he's forced to walk those posh Upper West Side streets.  Poor old bast--er, Baxter.  Well, that's how the luck turns, keywise.  (That's an inside joke; only viewers of The Apartment would get it.)  Yet another wild circumstance that this dark comedy-drama presents for viewers' critique and voyeuristic pleasure.<br /><br />Speaking of pleasure, the adulterous fantasies played out in the film are darkly Wilder.  Back in 1960, I wasn't yet agleam in my father's eye.  Come to think of it, with all the illicit fun folks seemed to be having back in the 1960s, perhaps I wasn't meant to be a gleam in my mother's eye, either.<br /><br />I couldn't more strongly recommend that you purchase [[ASIN:B0010AN7Z4 The Apartment (Collector's Edition)]].  After you have, please sit back and let Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's story unreel in black-and-white before your eyes.  You'll see why The Apartment earned five Academy Awards including Best Director, Best Original Screenplay and Best Picture.with all the illicit fun folks seemed to be having back in the 1960s, perhaps I wasn't meant to be a gleam in my mother's eye, either.

B00129H7VS|5.0|My husband and I just loved this set of DVD's.  It makes you really appreciate the men who serve and have served our country to defend our freedoms.  Hanks and Spielberg have done justice to the men of \\"Easy Company\\".  What a great movie!

B000ATQYT2|5.0|I've had this film on video for years and have now updated it to a DVD. It is a classic telling of the Christmas Carol and absolutely delightful. A must for all Muppet fans and will make a a believer out of anyone who is not.
B001EN71DQ|4.0|I don't know anything about this except my grandchildren were very happy to receive it.
B001EXE2ZQ|5.0|This movie is enchanting. The scenes of Rome make you want to go there, and it is so well acted that you understand totally why Audrey Hepburn won an Oscar for her performance. There's an innocence in this film not often seen today, but there is also tension, sexual tension, and the struggle of making decisions based on what is the \\"right\\" thing to do as opposed to what will make money, or ignore or avoid personal responsibility. All this woven into a love story, a comedy and the show place of Rome!
B000ICLRHK|5.0|Speed is just a truly entertaining movie and even better in Blu-Ray.  Upgrade your copy now.

B0019HQIFE|5.0|All there is to say is the following:    John Mayer's talent+ Blue Ray 1080P audio/video+ 50 inch plasma+ surround sound+ nice performance shots/editing/commentary/interviews = One happy costumer. It is better than being there unless you had great close seats.
068987474X|4.0|This book was exactly what I thought it would be, not that I was disappointed. As women, we may not want to believe that a relationship didn't work out simply because 'he's just not into me'. Reading this book and seeing it from a different perspective made me realize how oh so wrong I was when it came to men. Period! I'm screaming at the book because some of these women are so stupid and blind! But then I stop and realize, \\"oh wait...that was me once\\". I would absolutely recommend this book to any of my girlfriends. It's comical, frank and exactly what I needed to hear! Like I said, a slap of reality in the face!
B001DDBCUK|5.0|I really loved watching the girls in a full length movie. The fashion was great and every one lived up to their full reputation...except I expected more uumph from Jennifer Hudson.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my son.  This was the cheapest place I could find to buy it, so I was happy with that.  If you are a fan of LOST, you will enjoy the box set.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I saw Stop Making Sense on video years ago and loved the concert.  Getting it on DVD re-mastered and re-mixed was like seeing it for the first time.  The sound and picture are supreme and for anyone who likes Talking Heads it it is a must. I rate this 5 stars with no hesitation.
B000M4RG42|3.0|War is hell and thats what shows in this movie.  Its also about the men who raised the flag and how the government used them to raise money.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|These work really well.  If you ever had your fingers slide off then this is what you want. The only problem is that if one falls off they are hard to find.  Great for shooters and racing games.
B000N6U0E2|4.0|The movie was very good, but the case was cracked when I received it.  The condition of the case did not seem to affect the condition of the DVD, however.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 11 year old received this game for Christmas.  We brought it to our  family gathering where the entire family ages 9-68 soon became addicted to this fun and thought provoking game.  It can be played lightheartedly, winning by chance, or more challenging as the players use strategic moves to improve their game to place as many of game pieces on the board as possible. Each game has a different outcome and never gets boring. As the players get better the game becomes harder.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My entire family enjoyed this movie.  It is very entertaining with some suspense and lots of laughs.
0743298020|4.0|The product was delivered quickly and not in boxy packaging however the cover was in a lamanate casing that was irritating to deal with while reading. I knew it would be hardcover but I would've liked to know that it had a plastic casing.
080013799X|5.0|Monty Python, alone is more fun than whip cream on a oreo cookie.I love this movie.One of the best fun movies of all time.Worth watching over & over again.The quest to find \\"The Holy Grail\\",a killer rabbit,the black knight, the knights of \\"Nee\\" & more.  You must ask,can theses knight show valor & glory?Great fun & just great comedy movie trip.Enjoy the fun kids,I did.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|Best movie you could add to your BluRay collection.  Awesome fight scenes and amazing sound!
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Another Christmas request. It's a good movie if you like this sort of dark film. The recipient was pleased with it. Heath Ledger's performance was awesome! I saw it once and would not want it in my DVD collection, but most movie buffs would disagree.
B000IY03IM|5.0|I am sorry but I am a Jaco fan always! This is a remake with one extra cut. If your a diehard Jaco fan, get it!
0307341550|5.0|I won't go into the story line since that's already been done here, but suffice it to say that this is the best book I have read in a long, long time.  The story is fascinating, the writing is top notch and it kept me intrigued until the very end, which I hated to get to because I just wanted to keep reading this unbelievable book.  I hope she hurries and writes another one.
B000F0UUT6|5.0|This product was in perfect condition and this seller was a pleasure to do business with.
B0015FML06|5.0|What do you do when you plan to film a concert in a beautiful outdoor setting on a splendid summer evening and instead it rains?  If you're an up-and-coming U2 you go on with the show and film anyway and it turns out even better than planned.  As the notes in this deluxe reissue explain, the band reserved another venue for the following night and invited all the ticket holders to attend either concert or both.  Only about half showed up but they made up for those unwilling to stand in the rain.  And those who didn't come really missed out!<br /><br />U2 had a lot of energy but by this point in their career they also had a lot of passion to go with it.  This was the tour for the War album, their 3rd release (after Boy and October), and they were just becoming known in the US (not by me, unfortunately, as I didn't discover them until later).  But if nothing else, U2 has a talent for promoting themselves, and this show made for MTV was designed for that.<br /><br />And as much as I love The Joshua Tree, I might just like this one better (although that opinion might depend on the day you ask!).  The relatively short CD alone is fantastic and worth buying (only 2 songs, \\"Gloria\\" and \\"Party Girl,\\" actually came from that rainy concert), but the DVD is the best possible bonus for this remastered reissue.  Be aware that since it was originally shot on video there are some red streaks from the lights.  At first glance my wife thought the kids had taken a crayon to the TV screen, but you get used to it.  Also, the \\"send in the clowns\\" line from \\"The Electric Co.\\" has been omitted from the original VHS version, which seems to bother some people.  But none of that changes how much I love this DVD/CD set (I hate that song \\"Send in the Clowns\\" anyway).  I can't recommend it highly enough - make it ***6*** stars!
B000X5SPBI|3.0|The sixteen episodes varied in quality though it seems they got better for the most part as this season progressed.  Due to the writer's stike there are only sixteen episodes vs the four to six extra epsidodes enjoyed in prior seasons.  If the price is in the mid twenty dollar range or below I would say it is well worth it.  Otherwise wait for the price to drop or rent the dvds at any video rental store you can find that has them.
B000MR9D5E|4.0|This is arguably the most ambitious and sumptuous documentary of all time, a magnificent achievement from certainly the foremost natural history film-makers of the world. Often visually breathtaking and encompassing the world's major geographical regions and a fair representaion of the fauna and flora found therein.<br /><br />The script/narration is a little melodramatic at times. As a naturalist in southern Africa, with over 45 years experience of its wildlife, I was a little perturbed about the chapter on the \\"plight\\" of elephants in the dry season in the Kalahari region where they trudge many days, or even weeks, through the waterless wastes until, almost miraculously, they arrive at the life saving waters of the Okavango Delta. (Elephants need to drink almost daily, though can go three days without drinking.) So if this story is hyped up and rendered over-poignant, perhaps others are, too....<br /><br />But there is no denying the generally stunning photography and visual feast of this BBC production.
045122499X|4.0|I had never read any of Follet's work before this book. Initially, I had trouble getting into this book because Follet's prose really rubbed me the wrong way.  I found the characters and plot to be immediately compelling but sometimes the overly simplistic, almost childish, writing style was so bad as to take me out of the story altogether.  However, this problem lessened and gradually disappeared over the course of the story as the characters aged.  Perhap's Follet was experimenting with trying to match the narrative to the age of the characters.  I found this distracting but as I said it was  only apparent for the first bit of the book.    A lot of people have hopped all over this book for historical inaccuracies.  yes, the book is written in modern English with modern sounding dialogue.  Hello people - this book's timeframe is contemporary to that of Chaucer, the middle of the 14th century.  Of course Follet didn't write in Middle English.  Has anyone tried reading the Canterbury Tales in its original form?  It's not impossible but a novel written in Middle English would hardly be bestseller material.     I'll grant that the whole Merthin/Caris plot is highly implausible, placing twentieth century ideas and morality onto a medieval setting.  I'm aware of this and it doesn't bother as much as it did some people.  After all it is Historical FICTION not a history book.    When it comes to the actual historical details surrounding Feudal lordship and serfdom I found this book to be very useful.  Professors can spout off all they want about feudal labor, serfs, labor shortages, free tenancy, and higher wages resulting from depopulation but all these ideas are rather vague and abstract to the twety-first century mind.  this book did an excellent job of putting these abstract concepts into a the framework of practical examples using the characters in the story.  I feel like I am able to better visualize the day to day workings of feudalism because of it.    All in all Ienjoyed this book.  It wasn't the best book I ever read and it certainly wasn't 100% realistic but I found the characters to be compelling and the plot to be engrossing.  I especially praise the depth of Follet's characters; I hated the villians with a passion and was rooting for the good guys - which is what I want from this type of book.  However, at that the characters weren't cardboard cutouts.  The good guys had flaws and the bad guys could be sympathetic on occasion.      It's a pretty quick read for 1000 pages and I was never bored.
B001DJ7PN2|5.0|First of all, the service was superb!!  The movie and additional DVD's were exceptional!  This is a must see just to get you to think and see what really may have happened.  There are frightening events that are taking place today-you know what they say about history repeating itself!  It's a great movie based on actual facts!!
0545128285|4.0|So let's be honest, who can't use a little extra HP in their lives right about now?  This book had some fresh new insight into the series without being repetitive.  I enjoyed reading most of the short stories and for 6 bucks or so, you really can't go wrong with this quick read!
B000PTYPAC|4.0|I bought this  C.D for my daughter for Christmas, she has been playing in on our car's c.d. player.  I was impressed with the vocals from this group and each song has great rythm.  My daughter really enjoys this one.  It is one of her favorites.
0545128285|4.0|This is the shortest J.K. Rowling book ever!  I read it in two sittings (could have read it in one).  I thought it would be longer.  Proceeds go to the Children's Higher Learning Group, so that's good.  It probably takes a lot of time to think of a good fairy tale, so if we wanted to wait a couple more years, Ms. Rowling could have thought of more filler.    The stories aren't typical fairy tales and are about 4 pages long with 2 page commentaries by Dumbledore.  There are morals to the stories, which are good.  The stories are not really appropriate bed-time stories for children.  There is one story in there not really appropriate for young kids, but I can't remember which it is right now.      There is only one reference to Harry Potter, and that is the Tale of the Three Brothers, which was in the last Harry Potter book.
0399247459|5.0|I loved this book as a child and thought my son would like it too. He loves the pictures and reading the story. We have read it at least once a day (sometimes many more) since we got it on Christmas. He just turned three so he can't quite read yet but he has memorized some of the book and loves to \\"read\\" along.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I gave this CD to my mom on her birthday and she loved it. She plays it all the time. Great music.
B0007TKNII|5.0|thanks it was clean , new, and perfect. thanks for getting it here so fast..
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This was the best role Keith Ledger played.  Too bad we lost him too young.  He didn't have a chance to see how great he was.
B000ETQR3Q|4.0|I ordered this for my son's 10th birthday in early December.  He LOVED it.  He has a couple of other nerf guns and this was another to add to the collection.      One exciting part for him is the sheer size of it - 3 feet long.  It would dwarf a smaller kid.      One downside is that it only shoots one nerf bullet at a time and the reload time isn't super quick like some of the other nerf guns.      But overall, he is very pleased with it because he can strategically place himself on an upper or lower level of our quad-level house and shoot at a target (his sister, mother, dad, or friend) on another level.
0545128285|5.0|The book was quant and entertaining.  If you are a Rowling fan, then this is a must have!  The stories are fun, and interesting especially if you have already finished her previous books.  The downside is that the book is short, it took me less than an hour to read it cover to cover.  However, it was $8 well spent.  The price is moderate for the book!  Looking forward to her next book.
B00000JRTX|1.0|I don't remember anything about this movie except that I stayed up late one night to watch it on TV and felt absolutely cheated.  I had heard that the movie was good so I thought, \\"well, it's on, let's give it a try.\\"  But I seriously can't remember anything about it except that I thought it was terrible.  I almost want to watch it again just to see why it left such a bad taste in my mouth, except that, you know, I'm going to have to taste it again.  Hmm, maybe.  I can always turn it off when it starts to get painful.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I was worried about getting this before Christmas, but it was fast and new.. tnks
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|This is a great movie.  I love doing business with Amazon.  They ship really fast.
B00011F5DK|5.0|This game is extremely fun for the whole family.  Educationally it gets you to think about problem solving--what shape fits where and how to best get the most out of the shapes that you have.  What a treat to have such an exciting game!
B001AGXEAG|5.0|My 12 year old had never seen this movie so I bought it for her for Christmas. Needless to say it has been on ever since! Personally, I think this was Michael Keaton's best performance - the Harry Belafonte soundtrack rocks also!
1554072840|4.0|This book remains a beautiful jumping off point for potty training you little one. Our daughter loves it! If you're looking for scientific names, however, you're not going to find them here. However, it is a direct and gentle book.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|I've been a huge fan of the Black Keys for a long time, and I must say that they have yet to disappoint with any CD release, including Attack and Release. Although they do deviate from the \\"garage band\\" sound of just two dudes jamming, this album stays true to their blues-inspired music. If you are worried that this album will be nothing like the Black Keys that you know and love, don't. I was skeptical at first simply because it was produced by Danger Mouse, and was concerned that the blues roots would be lost. I had no need for my concern. In short, if you love the Black Keys, you should buy this album!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Some things age well.  Rush is one.  This DVD is wonderful, and shows how the years of musicianship have grown this group to the higher hights.  The sound is great, the picture is excellent, and the atmosphere of the show is mesmerizing.  Not quite sure about the roasted chickens though...kind of left me scratching my head. None-the-less...get this DVD and you will enjoy the best of this band yet recorded live!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|For anyone with a desire to learn about politics in this country or in the workings of our Republic; I would highly recommend this series.    I was unable to watch most of the series when it first aired because of the late time spot it had.  I was working at the time and had to leave very early in the morning.  But I have completely enjoyed this opportunity to watch the series in order and several episodes at a time.    For a seven year superb series I think the price is quite reasonable.
B00005JMK0|5.0|I think everyone here agree that this movie is great and ready to purchase it but... Now it is 2009, why not pushing for a release in Bluray.  Think how the song \\"Love is love\\" would sound in True HD audio.  The studio would certainly make a lot more money if the teens today have a chance to listen to this music instead of the junk out there now.  Update: June 2009.  I got this movie on DVD after 5 days by Royal airmail from Amazon UK, thanks to Edwin Chan.  The movie is as good as I can remember it.  Virginia Madsen still looks beautiful and Lenny is actually looks more handsome than I thought.  The good thing is the movie is DVD quality and widescreen.  However, the audio is only Dolby Digital 2.0 instead of something better like DTS.  The bad thing is it is Region 2 coded so you must own a region free DVD player to see it, or play it on the computer, or ...  I was hoping the Love is love video is included but they only have one music video: Together in electric dreams.  After watching it again tonight, it is still worth the money and the 25 years wait.
B001ED7C58|5.0|What an awesome compilation.  You won't be disappointed with this one.  If you liked the movie and loved the book, even better.  Once you read Twilight you will have to read the rest of the series.  I also got the illustrated movie companion and I highly recommend it as well.  Edward, played by Rob Pattinson, really played the piano piece of \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" in the movie and he has an awesome acoustic guitar piece on the soundtrack where he also sings.  Very very good!
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This movie was really cute...saw it at the show...and had to have it...it's a must for generations to come...
B001KMB6YG|3.0|Picked this movie up at Target today... the two-disk S.E. (wanted to see the features). Before watching I read the one review posted here on Amazon - the one star one. So I was expecting this to be a real stinker - or at least something along the lines of \\"Doomsday\\". But instead it wasn't all that bad of an action movie. The only complaint I might have is the ending is a bit abrupt and doesn't seem finished. I'll probably pick up the book and read it later.
0811828697|5.0|This book is absolutely incredible.  You can tell people really put some thought into the details for some of the wildlife of the Star Wars Universe for some creatures that would only be on scene a few seconds, or in some cases, were cut from the movie.  It is enjoyable to read.  Kids love pulling it out when they're at my house and trying to draw what they see.  The only down side is the book was published before Episodes II and III came out.  I would recommend this to anyone without hesitation.
B00006CXSS|5.0|My husband received this boxed set for Christmas. He was thrilled. The 6 dvd's came in a cool metal box. There was a fold-out insert with a lot of extra information which he loved. Amazon had the best price by far. I was very pleased as well.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|Don't get me wrong.  The movie is wonderful.  The music is wonderful.  And the ACTORS (yes, they are actors, not singers!) put so much heart and energy into their musical performances that their lack of singing ability is not too distracting while watching the movie.  But, just to listen to a soundtrack?  Save yourself some disappointment and get \\"ABBA Gold,\\" instead!
B001GQSY5U|3.0|The TV series is better than this movie but it is a great start to what I hope will redeem the franchise.  I love being able to get the digital copy of the movie.
B000J103PC|3.0|This movie was an impulse buy because it was priced on sale. It was entertaining but not anything great. I don't think I'd spend the time to watch it again after seeing it once, but it wasn't a bad movie and did make for a good relaxing night at home.
0545128285|2.0|Although a J.k. Rowling book is always a huge expectation to take us into another realm, I felt the book fell short and did not meet the standards of which we as Harry Potter lovers are accustomed.  The book was to easy of a read in order to get completely enthralled in the fairy tale.  I found the comments made by Dumbledore were rather boring and any person over the age of 10 would surely be dissapointed.  I think the only reason so many copies were sold was due to the fact that everyone is in mourning over the fact the series has ended, and thus are trying to reach out to anything that will keep them in the Harry Potter world.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Awesome CD! There were only 1 or 2 songs that I wasn't thrilled about, but the rest I kept listening to over and over.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is one of the sharpest and wittiest television shows to come along in a great while.  The five main characters play off one another to perfection.  The collection is especially entertaining to watch as there are no commercials to break the flow of the show.  A definite \\"must have\\" for geek lovers!!
0956010903|4.0|My expectations may have been a little high. The blue \\"gemstones\\" in the eyes of the metal skull on the cover were kind of a cheesy touch. To be honest, for $100, I was expecting a little more pizzazz than some glued-on crafts-store gems. Swarovski crystals would have done the job. They have a certain shine to them. And the Caribbean blue was not a good choice. If they must be blue, stick on a shade, like midnight blue, that looks like it has some depth you can't see through. A pale Caribbean blue just makes you think you can see all the way through the gemstone to the glue behind it. And it would have been even cooler if the book did look as handmade as possible--i.e. artsily ripped page edges to give the book even more of an antiquated, one of a kind look. Just wishing. There's nothing to prevent me from carrying out either idea on the book myself now that I have a copy :) I can be pretty good with a glue gun. And I am very good at ripping things, or as good as anyone else. Heh. So, I'll just make some lemonade and get to it.    The things that impressed me enough to give this item four stars: real leather binding for the covers of the fake book and the real book, super-speedy shipping (always a blessing during the chaos of the usual Christmastime shipping panic).
0307455874|5.0|This is a thoughtful and inspiring book which is written well without being stuffy, written simply without being dumbed down and even at times achieves eloquence, without being preachy. The chapters on \\"the Constitution\\",  \\"Faith\\" and \\"the World Beyond Our Borders\\" show a good grasp of American history, and the chapter on \\"Politics\\" is an assault on the do-nothing cynicism which seems to have settled into the hearts of too many Americans, both on the right and on the left. I was particularly taken by President Obama's criticism of liberal \\"progressives\\" who are so rooted in secularism that they reject people who have faith based values. The candid anecdotes from Obama's own life are fascinating, and reveal a good bit about how his ideas and his personality have been shaped. I wish every American would read this book, no matter who they voted for, and then come together with a renewed sense of purpose to work with each other, disagree civilly, and fully live up to our founding ideals.
B00102FELM|5.0|this is an amazing video of the Scorpions filmed live at Wacken Open Air Festival. with guest appearences from Uli Jon Roth, Herman Rarebell & Michael Schenker. from start to finish this dvd delivers. looks and sounds great on a home theater system.<br /><br />the only ones who won't like this dvd is your neighbors cause you cannot listen to the Scorpions and not crank it to 11.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive that five of my friends bought it for themselves even though we already have a board on which we play together weekly at school. this is a hardcore strategy game, and it gets very intense. it is not a party game, so don't expect to play with more than 6 people. if you're playing this game, you have to be focused, or you will be destroyed.
B001794FOK|3.0|I received Jumper from Netflix when it first came out on DVD in the summer of 2008...but I never watched it; after it sat for a week or so I just returned it because I was never compelled to spend the 90 minutes watching a movie that got average at best reviews.<br /><br />Well I finally had the chance to watch it on HBO last night...and it was good! With a talented director like Doug Liman and the awesome David S. Goyer involved, I knew that Jumper would be good...I just knew it.<br /><br />The OC's Rachel Bilson adds to a very OC overall cast in Jumper. In fact, the whole movie had a very [[ASIN:B0002V7TZQ The O.C.]] kind of feel...broken up in large part by the ever-present Samuel L. Jackson.<br /><br />The concept of the film is simple...just how I like 'em: Some kid discovers that he can teleport, but finds out the hard way that there are people that would rather not have teleporters in their midst. A fun ride of cool action ensues.<br /><br />So Jumper wasn't great...it was good. Let's put it this way: I won't wait for cable for Jumper 2...scheduled for a 2011 release...2011!...sheesh that's a ways off...might'z well JUMP!
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|My suggestion when you view this 3-D DVD you read the back of the box first. We didn't and we viewed the movie in 2-D, with 3-D glasses on and vowed only to see 3-D in theatres as iat wasn't very good. That night I went to Amazon.com and brought up this movie and learned it has both 2-D and 3-D versions on it. Yes, we put the 3-D glasses back on and viewed the movie on the other side. Wow, what a concept! It really does work if you view the correct side, 3-D, with the 3-D glasses. :) It was a good movie and the 3-D was very good.  Norah
0786838655|5.0|Very, excellent book. kept me the edge and when it finished i couldn't wait fr the next installment
0679882820|5.0|My son quickly memorized all the sounds the animals/objects in this book make.  This book involves the child and is very fun every time its read.
B001F290E4|5.0|At the beginning of his classic track \\"Killer,\\" Seal says, \\"It's the loneliness that's the killer.\\" And maybe that's just it: after you marry a supermodel and get her to duet with you on your CD (\\"Wedding Day\\" on System, 2007), even if it's quite a good song, the critics just don't take you seriously anymore, nevermind what you try next.<br /><br />Witness the tepid critical reception of what Seal tried next, Soul. The record is an hommage to classic soul music - it boldly and unashamedly soldiers through the well-known territory of \\"A Change is Gonna Come,\\" \\"Stand by Me\\" and \\"People Get Ready.\\" To make things even more complicated for the critics, it's produced by David Foster. Here are some excerpts from the web:<br /><br />  \\"Is this album really necessary? Well, life is really no better or worse after listening to Soul. It's a rather innocuous collection.\\" (From Popmatters)<br /><br />  \\"The problem with most of these songbook albums - Soul included - is that in choosing such memorable tunes, Seal inevitably invites comparisons to originals few can hope to transcend. Unless you do something radically different-see Cat Powers' inventive Jukebox (Matador) from last winter-you risk sounding like a sub-par imitation.\\" (From VIBE)<br /><br />  \\"But the songs he has chosen [...] have been reinterpreted so many thousands of times, he'd have to reinvent them to get anyone to pay attention, and the only thing new that Seal brings to the party is a feeling of swank Euro-sophistication that saps the music of much of its emotional oomph. Soul is an unnecessary record.\\" (From Rolling Stone)<br /><br />In a way, this is what a modern music critic would have to say, of course. We've been conditioned to expect that covers - at the very least - have to be unusual to pay them any attention. And covers sung by an artist whose prime, supposedly, is behind him... well, that's borderline unforgivable!<br /><br />The truth, of course, is much different. This is a very beautiful record. The overall sound is nothing short of remarkable - this is studio perfection without being dull, full of everything Pro Tools has to offer, but completely 'straight up': unlike, say, Amy Winehouse's Back to Black, which deliberately shows its hip hop production values and thus overlays its glistening sheen with some `old school' grit, Soul uses the entire arsenal of digital music making in the interest of sounding realistic. Of course, it's not true: while there undoubtedly many musicians here playing real instruments, there are - probably - as many virtual instruments. The amazing thing is, it sounds real, even though you know it can't be, at least not completely. It's like that moment in animated movies - Shrek, maybe, or Monsters Inc., when you noticed, \\"They can animate individual hairs now. Wow.\\"<br /><br />Seal's vocals are superb throughout. He's an excellent soul singer, in the same way that Annie Lennox is, for example. There's a very slight artifice in his interpretation of these songs - correctly identified in the quote from Rolling Stone - that I think is due to his non-American roots. He's not Sam Cooke, but then, nobody is.<br /><br />I think the key to refuting the critical consensus here is to say that these songs deserve to be sung. Sung in ways that don't make travesties of the original, classic arrangements by insisting on reinterpreting them for the umpteenth time. Jazz has an expectation where great singers must put their own spin, their own personal take on a song. Pop doesn't have the same paradigm, or at least not in exactly the same way. It's been quite acceptable to produce loving, detailed versions of songs that are, in some essential way, the same as the original. Sometimes, surprisingly, the constraints of performing a song using the same arrangement as the original has brought out something decidedly great. Listen, for example, to the Neville Brothers' version of \\"A Change is Gonna Come.\\" Daniel Lanois' sleepy arrangement can hardly be called a new interpretation - all it does is strip away some of Cooke's strings and replaces them with more guitars and synth pads. Yet Aaron's voice makes it into a very different song.<br /><br />Now, I'm not suggesting that Seal achieves quite the same heights of expressiveness in his version. But it's more than merely respectable - it's a very good version. And his \\"It's Alright\\" is amazing, as are \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\\" and \\"People Get Ready,\\" which comes across as truly heartfelt rendition that has something new to say.<br /><br />I think, it's enough - no more than enough: amazing - to hear a great voice perform emotionally accurate, heartfelt, inspired renditions of great material. If it's tastefully produced by one of the industry's leading lights, that's a bonus. Since classic R&B essentially ceased to exist as an alive genre in the 1970s, any `new' releases in this mode have been aimed at a rock audience and had more rock `grit' than is organic to the form. Seal's Soul simply restores the strings, horns and background vocals to their rightful place.<br /><br />I'm going to take a contrarian position: I recommend this.some of Cooke's strings and replaces them with more guitars and synth pads. Yet Aaron's voice makes it into a very different song.    Now, I'm not suggesting that Seal achieves quite the same heights of expressiveness in his version. But it's more than merely respectable - it's a very good version. And his \\"It's Alright\\" is amazing, as are \\"Here I Am (Come and Take Me)\\" and \\"People Get Ready,\\" which comes across as truly heartfelt rendition that has something new to say.

B00129H7VS|5.0|I purchase this for my father and he absolutely loved it.  The picture and sound quality is great.
B0007TKNII|1.0|My stupidity. Buying from the U.S. I had forgoten that their D.V.D. system and ours are not compatible. Don't get caught. I did, having bought Eric Clapton and not being able to play it either!!!!!!!
B000W99IPM|2.0|I well remember hearing Demus play in recital thirty years ago and felt he was one of the great ones. However, this set, cheap though it be, is not very satisfying for two main reasons, well, three. The sound is murky. The piano is somewhat mushy and not well-tuned. And Demus does some very strange things. For instance, in the first movement of the Fantasie he uses so much pedal that it is hard to hear the individual notes. And his tempi often wander all over the place, in the service of interpretation, I suppose, or perhaps it's his idea of rubato.<br /><br />I really can't recommend this except for the price. For people coming new to Schumann this would not be a very good introduction; that and the lack of notes militate against it being much of an educational tool.<br /><br />Scott Morrison
B00065VTU4|5.0|I don't really remember where I first got this, just that I first heard it when I was a teenager. Prior to this, I had only read about Clapton - the legendary British guitar slinger whose fans had spray-painted \\"Clapton is God\\" on an Underground station during his tenure with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers and who was commonly viewed as `right up there' with Jimi Hendrix and other A list guitarists.<br /><br />461 Ocean Boulevard didn't really sound like that guy - or at least not like what I imagine that guy would sound like. It's groovy, funky, low-key but energetic, and it has the energy of a great ensemble record, not a self-absorbed solo effort by a guitar god. Recorded in Miami in 1974, the title refers to the address of Clapton's residence there during that period.<br /><br />I think this music has held up very well over the years - it's a kind of bluesy rock masterpiece that shows Clapton's wide-ranging musical interests. Long before punk made it de rigueur to have reggae influences, this record features the famous version of \\"I Shot the Sheriff.\\" Other standouts are Elmore James' \\"I Can't Hold Out,\\" Robert Johnson's \\"Steady Rolling Man\\" and Johnny Otis' \\"Willie and the Hand Jive.\\"<br /><br />I love the subtleties in this: how Clapton's guitar is always the most tasteful thing you've ever heard - not too flashy, not too subdued, not too distorted; how Clapton's voice - often a point of discussion, but actually quite strong here - blends with Yvonne Elliman's (and the band's) background vocals. 461 Ocean Boulevard is a perfect demonstration of what was great about classic rock when it was firmly rooted in its rock `n roll and r&b roots.
B0018AK9RA|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. Superb lyrics,music,themes,orchestration etc.I was not sure what to expect.I figured it would either be good or a flop.Way better than expected.This type of music/lyrics is a culmination of many decades of experience,practice,maturation,experimentation.
1596434252|4.0|This is a delightful book, but I made the mistake of buying it for a 5 yr. old.  One flip through and that was it.  On to a tome on dinosaurs! It would help us out of the loop folks if there was a general age appropriate indication. I'd put this one in the 2-4 range....Er,right?
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|A great film and DVD. Highly recommended as it has something for everyone. I loved it when I saw it 15 years ago and it's just as good and relevant now.
B00005MP58|5.0|I love this movie. I have seen the other p & p movies made and by far I find this the most interesting and well done.  Well worth by and watching multiple times.
6305736650|5.0|\\"Casablanca\\" is a treasure.  It's one of those rare films that you can't see too often.  Each viewing bring a further appreciation of it.  It is Bogart at his best, Bergman at her most sublime and a cast of character actors with a personal, emotional attachment to the theme of the movie. It's no surprise that it has become one of the cinema's most beloved films. Its history is as fascinating as the film itself and the added features enrich a person's appreciation of the accomplishment of the film. The creative folk who make the film are every bit as interesting as the film they created.
0956010903|3.0|Be very clear on what you are getting. The big \\"book\\" is a poor quality platic container for the actual book. Ensure that your child or collector knows they are getting the little (it is around 6\\"x4\\") book inside a big plastic box, that should help avoid tears for either child or collector. The actual book is heavy for its size and the silver looking fixtures are real metal. The typeface and illustrations are attractive and have an old fashioned quality style to them.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|My son loves this movie! He sits with his toy whip an runs around the house acting the scenes out. I of course don't think it quite lives up to the originals, but still a good movie.
B0013ND36G|5.0|I really looked forward to seeing this in the theater, because I wasn't old enough to see the first two. I thought it was good. It did lack the awesome actress that Linda Hamilton is, but all in all not that bad. The only flaw I could see in the film was the addition of kate brewster. I can't quite figure that one out. Thankfully Mostow kept most of the story intact, and was a decent film. Even though a lot of people dislike this one, I think it still fits in with the overall story. I looked forward to seeing the culmination of everything in T4:Salvation, but was completely disapointed. Since then, I have gained a little more respect for this movie.
1582701709|5.0|I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THE BOOK. I BROUGHT IT FOR A FRIEND. I RECOMMEND IT TO EVERYONE.
B000007XUQ|5.0|One of my favorite Christmas CDs, full of holiday classics!  Karen Carpenter's voice is stunning, and hauntingly emotional - one of the greatest voices of the 20th Century - remarkable in it's range, control and clarity. Her voice can be joyfully fun, or make you tearful in it's exquisit, unique beauty!   Richard Carpenter is likewise remarkable in his creative arrangements of the music included in this CD set.    So sad to have lost her so young, but so grateful to them both for sharing their unusual talent!
031606792X|5.0|THIS BOOK WAS EXACTLY WHAT A 15 YR OLD GIRL WOULD WANT.  SHE WAS THRILLED WITH IT.  IT WAS DELIVERED ON TIME AND IN GREAT CONDITION.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This is one of the best if not the best Marvel Comics movie that they have made. It has great effects and great acting. Robert Downey Jr. is great in this movie.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Terrific movie. Have an early Sony Blu-Ray player, and this movie will not play on it. The need to \\"update\\" the software on Blu-Ray players is maddening!
B00000J048|5.0|I recently bought this toy for my son Jacob who is four and Autistic,He really likes this toy although I can't keep it together long enough for him to really see all of them working. I'm just glad he plays with it! I would buy from them again!! Thank You!! Heidi Van Oss
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Wall-e was a great movie for adults and kids.  It shows how lazy people have become and how large of a problem garbage can become if we don't do something about it.  It also shows how much our society depends on technology and how it can become a detriment to the evolution of our species.  There is almost no dialoge at all in the first part of the movie, so it really allows you to use your other senses to get a feel of whats going on.  Overall a great movie, funny for the kids and some built in humor for adults that the kids won't understand Pixar is good at that.  If you like this film I would highly recommend: Idiocracy.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I went to see Pink Floyd in concert in the 70's, during the original Dark Side of the Moon tour, and this concert, 30 years later, is just as good as the original, if not better...
B000SNUMC0|4.0|As with all opinions, mine is based soley on my point of view. And with this CD I felt as though my POV was used more than usual. This CD is a fantastic marriage of Sci-Fi, fantasy and Heavy METAL. Being a fan of all three genre's, I find this an exciting project. For the most part I believe a Heavy Metal fan is by nature, to some degree, a Sci/fi-fantasy fan. But without an appreciation for those two genre's you may not care for it.     I am a new fan of Iced Earth (yes, I've been in a cave), and in my brief experience I feel Matt Barlow is this bands true singer. As a matter of fact, if Barlow had sung this album I more than likely would have rated it 5 stars. This is in no way a knock on Tim Owens, it's that pesky POV coming into play. I grew up with 70's/80's metal (I lost touch once everything was covered in \\"hairspray\\"), so I'm a fan of Dio, Dickenson and Halford. Hearing the vocals on \\"Framing Armagedon\\" is like listening to a mix of all three voices and styles. Though there is nothing wrong with that, it just didn't sit right with me. Don't take me wrong. Owens sounds great on this CD, but I feel he lacks the emotion that Barlow's vocals offer. It's rumored that Jon Shaffer is going to re-release this CD with Barlow. Some may find that a bit greedy, and maybe it is, but if it sounds as good as I believe it will and I enjoy it as much as I believe I will, than I'll but it.     The theme for this concept album is outstandingly fresh and imaginative. Jon Shaffer's rythym guitar-work and lyrics make up for the lack of the \\"twin lead guitar\\" sound this style of metal normally uses, though there is still some nice guitar solo's to be heard. It isn't quite as melodic as earlier I.E. work (The Dark Saga), but I still recommened it.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|this album was awesome my 1 year old daughter and i listen to it all the time she even sings some of the words and when she wants to hear it she mama pink it is so cute ..... THIS ALBUM WAS AWESOME
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I RECEIVED THE COLLECTORS GIFT SET IN PLENTY OF TIME FOR MY DAUGHTERS CHRISTMAS GIFT. I WAS DISAPPOINTED TO HERE FROM HER THAT SEVERAL OF THE DVD'S WERE SCRATCHED.
0956010903|5.0|This book arrived on the release date, and I was not at all dissapointed. Despite the price, this edition with the printed drawings (10 of them) and the reproduced hand-written introduction by J.K. Rowling are very fun collectable touches, also the velvet bag is nice and fits very snugly inside the larger book. Another thing is, being a reproduction of the multi-million doller hand written version, I thought that the metal clasps and such would feel cheap, but they do not, the book within the book feels very solid. Overall it's a fun novety, and a very neat collectable that i'd reccomend to any Harry Potter fan.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Special effects are great and Heath Ledger does an incredible job playing the joker. If you liked \\"Batman Begins\\" you should like this, too.
1881273156|5.0|Gary Chapman writes in his book about the five specific languages of love ~ Physical Touch, Quality Time, Gifts, Words of Affirmation, and Acts of Service. Once you know your own love language as well as others, relationships soar!  I loved this book!! :)
0740745271|5.0|Looking at the images in this book just makes my brain happy. It puts me in an altered meditative state instantly. Sometimes I can feel my body just wants to look at the book again.<br />I wish the other magic eye books were as good, because I do feel sometimes I'd like some new images, but the other ones are not as good and don't do as a good a job of putting me in that state.<br />The text is mediocre but it doesn't matter. The book is great...it's all about the experience for me. I think it does also improve vision. I've given it as a gift to many family members and recommend it regularly, especially to those who \\"can't meditate\\" or those who want to improve their eyesight.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|The 2-disks give you the option of seeing the Christmas classic in b/w or color, which is fun.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|At first I was too irritated with the main character, Anne, for not being pretty enough. She's to have had faded looks and regain them as the story goes on. Hmmm. She could have been made to look a bit more attractive. Upon subsequent observation, I've decided I can get over it, and am really enjoying this movie as another Austen triumph. It's not A&E's Pride and Prejudice, but it hasn't the time to develop, either. So...all in all the acting is great (Mary and Wentworth especially) and for Austen fans it's a good addition to your collection. Worth watching.
B001F290E4|5.0|I love this CD. What an unexpected suprise. I bought it because I like his version of the Change. I could only think brilliant by the end of the last tract and I have been playing this in my care everyday for the last month    This CD may be made up of cover versions but Seals voice is certainly original
B00127RAJY|5.0|Wow, this is a great DVD. But prepare to work - Jillian is TOUGH. She is also very encouraging though, without being annoying or obnoxious...I like her style and look forward to continuing to use this DVD on a regular basis.
B000J103PC|1.0|DO NOT waste your money on this nothing show about nothing.  STUPID!! SHOCKED that Meryl Streep would even consider acting in this movie as a star!! I
0545128285|5.0|For those who are saddened by the end of the Harry Potter saga, \\"The Tales of Beetle the Bard\\" is a refreshing visit back to the wizarding world. Whilst children can enjoy the tales, adults will find it relaxing reading, too. A collection of short stories, so even those short on time can find a moment to enter the world of magic. For Harry Potter fans, highly recommended. And who knew JK Rowling was such a good artist?
0765318741|5.0|This is a series of short stories, which I wasn't aware of when I bought it. But, every short story in this book is exceptionally well done, with different writing styles and tones as needed. I was very impressed.
1580176941|5.0|This is an excellent book to both motivate and instruct.  The professional appearance of their cookies is something to strive for, but don't be disappointed by your first attempt.  Their note to PLAN first is one of the most useful items in the book. Step-by-step instructions and TIPS along the way make this book a favorite. My only complaint would be that the gingerbread recipe needs some \\"tweaking\\" to make it more edible and easier to work with.  I'd highly recommend this book for anyone looking to make some professional looking cookies.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This was a very good movie that everyone should see.  In inspires you to never give up on anything your heart desires.
0545128285|4.0|These magical fairytales bring us back to the world of Harry Potter. They keep perfectly in form with the series and I found myself believing that these were definitely stories wizard children would have been told, passed down through generations.<br /><br />Dumbledore's commentaries do augment the stories, but I found them at times to be a bit distracting, as I hurried through them to continue the next tale. I think the book needs them to complete the stories, but I wished they were a tad shorter. Sometimes, they just went on and on and on.<br /><br />Overall a quick read. It was not as satisfying as the books in the Harry Potter series, but then maybe I'm just yearning and this is not a fair comparison. Rowling does an excellent job of transporting us to this distant world where magic exists, and I feel I am there once again.
B000N6TX22|4.0|My 25 year old son recommended this movie; he has a bent toward music and movies well outside of mainstream. This movie offers meaning at multiple levels - look beyond the obvious. I enjoyed it and hope you find worth the viewing as well.
B000PXUA5W|5.0|It was a perfect way to encourage him to learn to tell time.  He loves it.
B0009A40ES|5.0|I saw this movie at a friends home but I am going to buy the DVD.<br />I could talk about the movie in 'critic' terms.<br />Terms which are related to the analysis of certain elements and aspects of the movie.<br />However since in my opinion such analysis is utter hogwash, I'll just give my generalview.<br />Bateman was a master of fitting in. He possessed all of the qualities needed to succeed in 'society'.<br />Yet, internally he loathed the very world that he was proficient in, and his only release was violence and raw passion.<br /><br />I think this movie can apply to any and all eras.<br />Many of us know people who seem to rise to the top in society.<br />Who seem to have a diamond chakra when it comes to luck and occurrence.<br />While many others do just enough to maintain.<br />But are those at the top all happy?<br />Either way, whether one is successful, mediocre, or a failure by the terms of the society they live in, most people are still cogs in the machine.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Sony did a great job on this controller.  The charge lasts what seems like forever.  Everyone with a PS3 should get at least 4 of these bad boys.  Do yourself a favor and go with these over the off brand controllers.  These look better and last longer (charge and lifespan).
B000F0UUIM|5.0|Being 50,I can't take technology for granted. To go from black and white television where the only way to change the channel was to get up and go to the knob on the TV, to a widescreen, completely restored print of a 50 year-old John Wayne/John Ford Classic is almost indescribable.  BUY THIS DVD !!! TRUST ME.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|First of all the watch was quickly delivered, no long wait and it was packaged good as well. The watch so far is great, sturdy, overall a good watch for the money.
B001GQSY5U|5.0|I gave this as a Xmas gift.  The person who received it was thrilled.
1433502445|5.0|This is, without question, a great Bible. However, I have two issues, one relates to personal pronouns used for members of the Godhead, and the second one is relative to my copy of this Bible which I purchased from Amazon.    Call me quirky, but I prefer to have personal pronouns which refer to members of the Godhead capitalized. The ESV does not do this.    The second issue relates to some type of printing error on about three pages:  two in Galatians and one in Ephesians. The text on the binding side of the pages printed in such a way that it appears blurry--as if it were printed over twice. For the main text this is not such a big deal. But, the very small text of the cross-references, and to a lesser degree the text of the study notes, is very difficult to read due to being blurry. This problem is somewhat negated by using a magnifying glass. It's not really a big deal, but I thought that I would mention it.
0321525655|2.0|I had high expectations on this book. And I found it interesting only for beginners. Too much text saying basically the same, and few visuals. I would had expected more, considering that it's a book on presentations.
B0001I561E|4.0|This was purchased as a gift and was only available through Amazon.  Since it was a special request I was very happy to find it and the other Aladdin DVD's all in one place.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My son and I have played together.  He is 5 years old.  It is fun but I look forward to having more people play so it is more challenging.
B0000024K1|5.0|what can I say, this album is a must have for black music lovers. It's a milestone.
B001DTPZNY|2.0|If there's anyone out there who actually enjoyed watching this flick, I'd be amazed.  What a shame they destroyed the final segment to an awesome franchise with this stinker.  I'd rate it a 3 out of 10.  It's worth it to watch just because it's Indiana Jones, but DON'T buy it; rent it!
B000WGWQG8|1.0|When we went to view the DVD, we found two disc 2's and no disc3.  Amazon fixed the problem, but what a pain.
B001FB0WBK|5.0|Anyone who likes great guitar playing will love this video. I have another DVD by Tommy, but this is \\"the best,\\" and exactly what I was looking for when I bought the album and the CD. I rate the DVD  higher than the CD because it's really hard to appreciate how good Tommy is unless you see what he is doing. He is a very 'visual' performer who puts is all into every song. One of the highlights is when he segues into a sensual \\"Waltzing Matilda\\" from the finger virtuosity of \\"The Tall Fidler.\\" The percussion rhythm work on \\"Mombassa,\\" and, \\"Nine Pound Hammer\\" demonstrate that this musician is a lot more than just another guitar player. The song writing is stunning as well making this simply, \\"The Best.\\"
0446579939|5.0|read it in a day.  just like the rest of his books.  he is a wonderful writer.
B001GQACGE|5.0|Great music. I especially like Shoulda Put A Ring On It and If I Were A Boy. This CD made great stocking stuffers for young adults on my list.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my daughters. They love it. They have watched it numerous times since they got it.
B001AII4RM|4.0|Definitely enjoyed the Blu-ray version visuals were sweet but sound was awesome!!!never want to watch a reg. dvd again they do no justice to movies.<br /><br />Though the animated movie does not follow the book,while I did read it 10+ years ago and it was not fresh on my mind,this does not detract from the movie on its own,if your into the sword&sorcery fantasy genre buy this movie you will enjoy it as much as I have.<br /><br />\\"I am Ripper... Tearer... Slasher... Gouger. I am the Teeth in the Darkness, the Talons in the Night. Mine is Strength... and Lust... and Power! I AM BEOWULF!\\"<br /><br />With a line like that how cn you not love this movie?!?!
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This item was a gift. It is one of the best all time love stories. It is a great movie. Best all time love story
0060849827|5.0|This book is quite small and a great stocking stuffer.  Good gift idea for anyone who enjoys outdoor activities or watching the survival shows on TV.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|From the moment the movie starts to play you know you're in for a Hi-def treat. The opening scenes of the Gotham buildings couldn't be sharper. And there are no grainy scenes to complain about. The story and acting are solid, and the sound track is amazing even with only the my plasma screen speakers. This BD film should bring in record sales. If only all BDs could be produced with the same quality.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Best modern day musical.  It's no wonder coming from Josh Whedon, but it amazing how well done the mesh of new actors, new styles, and new technologies; with a older genre.
B00144VBBS|5.0|I have never been a huge Toby Keith fan, however, my Mom wanted this cd for Christmas.  After listening to it with her, I have a much better appreciation for Toby's talent.  His songs are stories set to music and this cd has many of his best hits on it.  My favorite is American Soldier.  It really touches me every time I hear it and helps me to continue to remember our men and women who are fighting for our freedom everyday. Overall, the rest of the songs on this cd are also excellent and I would recommend it.
B000R7GKQE|4.0|i ordered these seasons for a christmas present.  i recieved them in great time and they were in excellent condition.  my son-in-law was  very happy with his gift.

B001C46P2A|5.0|But I'm a sucker for schmaltz & really enjoyed this. Amazon apparently wants more recent reviews & this one has not yet arrived as a dvd. But it should be a great success here. It has several favorite American movie genres. It's a western, a war movie & love story between people from different social classes. The first part has cowboys, a cattle drive, treachery & a budding romance between boss Lady Sarah & her hired hand, Drover. That neatly transitions into the start of World War II & the Japanese sneak attack on Darwin, a port in northern Australia. This happened 10 weeks after the attack on Pearl Harbor. While not as devastating it was in many ways similair. Another subject touched on is the genocidal racism praticed by the white imperialist on the original native inhaibitants. The vistas of Australia's outback are breath-takingly beautiful & the production of the war scenes was well done. Then you have the acting leads. Nicole Kidman & Hugh Jackman are likeable bone-fide movie stars. Not much to complain about as an entertainment vehicle. Somewhat of an old-fashioned type movie that is not made nearly as often as I would personally like.
B00177Y9ZM|4.0|Any movie that emphasizes that there are consequences for your actions I believe is worth watching.  The idea behind the movie is a little out there but all in all once you get past the \\"science fiction\\" you see real people just trying to do what is right - most of the time.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This is yet another reference Blu-ray title from Disney!  I've come to expect nothing less than the best from them and they keep delivering.  I have owned Sleeping Beauty, in VHS, Laserdisc, DVD Platinum and now Blu-ray format.  It has never come close to looking or sounding as good as it does now.  Disney Blu-rays are an automatic purchase for me!
B001ED7C58|5.0|this item was highly requested for Christmas was overjoyed the recipient. thank you so much for making sure we received it in a timely manner and for your care in shipping.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This was one of the best mini series I have ever seen. Very well done!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Joss Whedon has created another wonderful hit. Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog has just the right amount of evil mixed with just a touch of cheesiness. It's really hard to decide which is more enjoyable. Watching Dr. Horrible, or watching it while listening to Commentary the Musical.<br /><br />Neil Patrick Harris does a fantastic job as the main character Dr. Evil. He's trying to get into the Evil League of Evil, headed up by Bad Horse. While creating a video blog about it, we find out that he's got a crush on a beautiful girl from the laundry mat Penny, played by Felicia Day from The Guild. We also learn that his arch-nemesis is Capt. Hammer, played by Nathan Fillion from Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Firefly.<br /><br />If you watched it for free over the internet, or purchased the episodes from iTunes, I would still recommend buying the DVD. It not only includes all three acts, it also has a special commentary track called Commentary the Musical. It's just what it says it is. A commentary track that's a musical in its own right. That alone is worth the price of the DVD.
031606792X|5.0|Great ending for a superbe saga!  Congratulation to the Stephenie Meyer. All the books are worth reading, and this lst one is definitely my favourite one. The perfect ending, I couldn't have asked any better!  You guys totally gotta reat it!!

B00004R960|3.0|This was Oasis' fourth album after the disappointing \\"Be Here Now\\". I think most fans had expected a step upwards again with this album, but unfortunately this was not the case. Compared to the excellent \\"What's the Story, Morning Glory?\\" this is really a disappointment.  In every respect this albums falls short compared to WTSMG. It does not have all the great songs, it is a much poorer production, Liam's vocals sound strained in comparison and the overall impression is one of lack of inspiration.<br /><br />Having said all this, it does have some minor highlights. \\"Go Let Let if Out\\" is not a bad single, and one of the few tracks that has the old sound of the band. \\"Who Feels Love?\\", with it's Bee Gees vocal harmonies is also decent, but too long. The same can be said about \\"Gas Panic\\", a track which also suffers from too heavy production and too much sound - not a bad song, though.<br /><br />\\"Sunday Morning Call\\" has a nice melody, but some very poor synth-choir keyboard sounds - still my personal favourite on the album.<br /><br />\\"Roll it Over\\" is also a good song in the same vein as Champagne Supernova\\" and \\"Cast No Shadow\\", though not quite in the same league - again too longwinded.<br /><br />Maybe the fact that only \\"Go Let it Out\\" was chosen for their \\"Stop the Clocks\\" compilation, says it all.

1439102813|5.0|Lisa,    Your book came out yesterday in paperback and I had been waiting for it. I bought it and read it practically in one sitting.     WOW! I wish I was articulate enough to tell you how much this book moved me. At first, I didn't think I was going to like Alice, she seemed rather rigid and uptight. But as the book progressed, I liked her more. She almost seemed to be more real and emotionally there as her Alzheimer's progressed. I don't know if that was your intention or not but I like it. I liked that the book was from Alice's perspective. It felt very real and terrifying.  It also made me wonder if I could have the same symptoms. I'm sure many people will feel that way.    I am sure the book was realistic in your characterization of John and Alice's children. I found John's attitude and denial, although totally understandable and true to life, enraging and almost unforgivable.    I was surprised the book ended when it did. I was ready for the next chapter and then it was the Postscript. I am so looking forward to your next book. It sounds so interesting!    Good Luck to you. I'll be watching for your next book.

055358894X|5.0|I can't believe this is Scott Lynch's first novel.  The plot is so carefully constructed, the writing so elegant, the characters so believable that it seems like the work of a much more experienced author.  I guess Lynch just has a lot of natural talent.  The Lies of Locke Lamora is a witty and fun fantasy adventure.  It is well-paced and exciting from the very beginning.  The story is complex, with unexpected twists and turns.  Lynch is an excellent world-builder, and Camorr is vividly painted through his words--a sort of fantastical Venice.  In fact, Camorr was for me one of the most engrossing elements in the story.  I felt like Lynch really immersed me in this fantasy city in a way that made me want to stay there.  If you enjoy Matthew Stover's books, you will love Scott Lynch.  There are a lot of similarities between the two authors, though Lynch is less over-the-top than Stover (in terms of violence, language, gross-out factor, etc.), which I think makes Locke Lamora more fun.  This book is lighter reading than, say, Heroes Die, or than George R.R. Martin's Song of Fire & Ice, but I think that's a good thing.  This is a book that is easy to enjoy because it is a great adventure with compelling characters in a compelling setting.  I am excited that it is the beginning of a new series, because I am really looking forward to reading a lot more from Lynch!  Highly recommend!

0743496728|3.0|I've been reading Jodi Picoult's books since the early days, and have been wondering lately if she's just running out of time and material. I picture this woman running for a life on a treadmill, racing to crank out one or two books a year. While I understand that writing is a business for many people, I have respect for people like Wally Lamb who wait ten years for a good story to come along (and offer to give back the advace money when one doesn't).<br /><br />OK, so now that I'm not expecting great literature from Picoult, I have to admit to enjoying this story, if not immensely. It's readable enough and considering the subject matter, not terribly intellectually or emotionally demanding. If that's what you want from a school shooting story, dig in!<br /><br />I had frankly hoped for more, and I couldn't help but feel that Picoult has become a victim of her own popularity. The plots and characters seemed pulled from her earlier works. I think she tried for complexity by making the characters more morally ambiguous. IMHO, it backfires -- Josie comes out looking like a brat, Alex a flake and Peter like a cookie cutter villain assembled from internet sites on school-shooters. By the middle of the book, I thought that maybe I had figured out the trademark Picoult surprise twist. I hoped for the next two hundred pages I was wrong. I was right.<br /><br />This book suffered from other annoyances that have cropped up in Picoult's recent works, a superfluous love story (my only beef with the otherwise superb My Sister's Keeper is repeated here, even more pointlessly). There is also a ramping up of the saccharine parent-child love prose that was acceptable in MSK, getting annoying in The Tenth Circle, and here finally begins to assault my gag-reflex here. Yes. Parents love kids. But there are only so many paragraphs that can (or should) be devote to describing little Peter's kisses, or his chubby baby feet, or the handful of crushed flowers he gave mom as a toddler (not Picoult's exact images, but along those lines). This goes on for paragraphs and paragraphs, particularly in the last section. For crying out loud, Baby Boy has already grown up and gone on a killing spree! Give mom a more complex or ambiguous thought to grapple with.<br /><br />If you're going to the beach and just want a light, fluffy read, this is the school shooting book for you.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy, who impressed me in The Last King Of Scotland till I learned his character didn't exist in real life) is a young twenty-something who's life is droll and predictable. He suffers from what he thinks are panic, headache-like attacks whenever he's provoked. Then one day he finds out through a mysterious woman (Angelina Jolie, who seems a little too old to play this Lara Croft look-a-like at this point) that he's the son of a former gone-rogue member of an elite group of assassins called Fraternity, who have special abilities of quick reflexes and healing powers. Brought in by the groups leader (Morgan Freeman collecting one Hell of a paycheck here), he's told of his past, very quickly trained in a variety of wild and unbelievable murderous ways, and is sent on a mission to use his new sharpshooter skills to kill the man that murdered his father. But is the team he's on the good guys or not?<br /><br />Good question. Wanted is a fun but highly unbelievable story featuring some crazy CGI-filled stunts that base the movie in the fact that you can shoot a bullet like a MLB curve-ball. Cars are flying all over the place, trains are derailing with good guys barely getting a scratch, and heroes getting stabbed in the hand and sharp-shooting perfectly the next. In fact, if this movie reminded me of anything, take all of the Sci-Fi aspects of the first Matrix film, smarten-up Keanu a bit, and you have the first hour of Wanted to a tee. This definitely is one of those \\"leave your logic at the door\\" type of over-the-top films. But unlike the previous years \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\", this one will have you groan the phrase \\"Oh, c'mon on\\", than say it with glee. At times it's well-placed humor is put interestingly, but overall it's hard to believe plot and impossible in the real world stunts might be too much to fully keep you in the movie.<br /><br />Concerning the single-disc edition, I can barely suggest it as an informative rental, much less a purchase. The SD picture and audio do live up to those standards, but outside of 6 minutes of start-up trailers (which can't be chosen afterwards), this disc has nothing but movie. But the movie does have alot of eye-candy in it, and will keep you entertained, but you gotta wonder, if your shirt had a few misstitching in it, is it trying to tell you a code to kill a certain person? No I didn't think so.<br /><br />Pros:<br />*Alot of wacky, cool car chases and bullet travels in this movie,<br />but really it's a bit too much to be believed.<br />*James McAvoy proves you don't have to be Shia LaBeouf to play a 20-something in the wrong place at the wrong time in 00's movies.<br />*If you're a fan of Freeman and Jolie, well.....they're in this movie. Just think how they laughed all the way to the bank on this one.<br /><br />Cons:<br />*The \\"Oh, C'mon!\\" factor is very high here.<br />*The ending, though at times clever, makes you think these guys take their job way too seriously.<br />*Though she's only five years older than McAvoy in real life, seeing these two kiss makes you hum the rock classic \\"Hot For Teacher\\". Hope he got at least a B for that performance there.<br /><br />(RedSabbath Rating:7.0/10)io do live up to those standards, but outside of 6 minutes of start-up trailers (which can't be chosen afterwards), this disc has nothing but movie.

B00004W50T|5.0|The Band provided a new model for rock music with Big Pink. They combined what they learned from working with Dylan with their own take on Americana (even though they were mostly Canadians) to come up with a set of sophisticated, timeless, well crafted songs. The arrangements showcased the excellent musicianship of the entire group, rich in subtleties while deliberately avoiding the extended soloing that was popular at the time. The result was the first in several superb albums from one of the most important bands of the last century.

0307269752|5.0|This is probably the best book I have read since The Devil in the White City.  I couldn't put it down and it has all the elements I look for in a good book!  Mikhael Bloomvist (excuse me if I misspell any names because they are all Swedish) is in a desperate spot and then asked by a wealthy elderly industrialist (Henrik Vanger) to solve a 40 year old mystery around the disappearance of his granddaughter (Harriet Vanger).  Mikhael doesn't realize what he bargained for when he agrees.  As the story unfolds we start to learn little tidbits of the Vanger family involving secrets, jealousy, hate etc. that is was more intriguing than the Collins family was in the old Dark Shadows tv show.<br /><br />Eventually, Mikhael needs to call on the services of Salander a punk rockish type of computer hacker who is an entire story all by herself.  As Mikhael and Salander start coming up with new clues, bad things happen.  Along with the danger of unraveling the mystery, Mikhael faces jail time for a problem that occurred with an enemy of the Vangers and the possible collapse of his publishing company (Millenium).<br /><br />This was a book that I did not want to end but I noted on the jacket that the author wrote two more forthcoming books just before his unfortunate death and they will be coming out this year so I will eagerly look for them.

6305537321|5.0|I only saw this movie all the way through for the first time a few days ago. And what a surprise it was.<br /><br />All I can saw is wow, what a feast for the eyes. All these great old actors and actresses, many of them no longer with us, all seeming to have a wonderful time in this star-filled romp that is just classic old Hollywood 50s light faire. It is truly a blast from the past. But the movie has more in the way of depth and substance than at first appears.<br /><br />The plot hinges around Hepburn's secretive Holly Golightly character, as George Peppard tries to figure out just who she is and where she came from, which is only gradually revealed as the movie progresses. The dialogue more than hints that she's an expensive, high-class call girl, but still, there's nothing more than the \\"$50 for 15 minutes in the powder room\\" comments to imply that. But Peppard's reactions to these revelations is one of the funnier aspects of the movie. Eventually, Holly's identity is revealed through a series of accidental meetings Peppard has with people from Holly's past.<br /><br />Holly seems determined to marry a wealthy playboy, or any wealthy man for that matter, no matter how much older or how unscrupulous, and the vulnerability she reveals behind her devil-may-care facade makes this one of her most appealing roles. George Peppard plays the young, indigent writer who ultimately wins Holly's heart.<br /><br />The movie takes some pointed jabs at various aspects of Hollywood and American society. In the movie, almost all the characters (except for Hepburn and Peppard) are rascals or rapscallions of some sort, scheming or plotting something, exploiting or using someone else, or are just slightly smarmy or unsavory in a sort of charming and engaging way. It's totally harmless and a lot fun to watch. But the deeper social implications are not far beneath the otherwise highly polished surface of this New York society.<br /><br />Oops, I almost forgot...actually George Peppard is a kept man sleeping with an older, wealthy, married woman (played by Patricia Neal) for much of the movie until he decides to make a play for Holly. So even he is using someone too. :-) Although he does eventually break off that relationship and redeems himself in the end.<br /><br />By the way, a little side note here. The cat who acted in the movie was trained by the great Frank Inn, who trained many of Hollywood's most famous animal actors, including Arnold the pig, Orangey (the cat in this movie), Benji the dog, Lassie, Cleo from People's Choice. His animals have won 40 Patsy awards (the animal equivalent of the Oscar). When he was 17 he was run over by a car in Culver City and pronounced dead. Fortunately, a mortuary student noticed he was still alive, and he recovered after a long convalescence. Most of the people currently working in Hollywood as animal trainers were either trained personally by him, or by his students.<br /><br />Overall, a great classic of American cinema that still holds up today.wealthy, married woman (played by Patricia Neal) for much of the movie until he decides to make a play for Holly.

B000002LHX|4.0|Yes, it might be a soundtrack, but it's certainly not a soundtrack to Tim Burton's movie, where Prince's songs, a stereotypically studio-enforced addition, were more distracting than helpful.  On this album, they become something else: a soundtrack, yes, but a soundtrack to a film within Prince's mind.  It even has vision (see \\"The Future\\" and \\"Electric Chair\\").  Criticism that these songs have just been yanked from Prince's vault may be true: the three recorded before the other six are definitely the best.  \\"Vicki Waiting\\" is on par with the bulk of Prince's work, and is the best song on here, though the glimmering \\"Scandalous\\" is one of the best ballads he's ever recorded.  Then you have the bizarre, ultra-campy \\"Batdance,\\" which somehow remains hip as hell throughout itself.  \\"Trust\\" and \\"Lemon Crush\\" are a little too mechanical, but they help keep the album uneven--which is one of its most attractive attributes.  Comic fans or even fans of the movie might have a hard time connecting with this stuff, but Prince fans ought to dig it.
B000002L9B|5.0|Prince's last record with the Revolution is a parade, alright.  It's a straightforward attack on listeners, with taut, sensuous weapons.  The attack plan is a little more abstract than it should be, since it is a soundtrack, but it's more than enough to get even the most comatose and cretinous persons shaking and feeling the music.  Speaking of which, Prince has moved on not just from his past image--notice the slick, basic, new Prince on the album cover--but also from the messianic rock of \\"1999\\" and \\"Purple Rain.\\"  He's no more humble, but he's much more baroque (the old Prince wouldn't have written a lyric like \\"No one plays the clarinet like you play my heart\\").  As a whole, the album is Prince's most cohesive effort, thanks in part to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\"-esque vision and sequencing.  The production is knock-down drag-out flawless: just experience \\"Kiss,\\" the lead single, maybe the strongest argument for minimalism since Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue.\\"  He's smarter than he was on \\"Around the World in a Day,\\" too, which was really good, but didn't really feature any exciting new thoughts.  He devotes an entire album, for the eighth time, to romance, lust, and love, his strengths, but he only grants tricky old death one line, in the poignant \\"Sometimes It Snows in April\\": \\"Sometimes I wish life was neverending/And all good things, they say, never last.\\"  He even makes like he might mellow and offers, \\"I love you baby, I love you so much/Maybe we can stay in touch.\\"  Yeah, right.

B001HDO4YW|3.0|Still riding the waves summoned by \\"Viva La Vida,\\" the boys make like their heroes, Radiohead, and release a new product made from songs recorded during the sessions for their last album that weren't used on that album.  A few of these eight tracks are as attractive as those on \\"Viva La Vida,\\" but they lack the faux-bold production that made \\"Viva La Vida\\" seem so good.  Now that the original with-lyrics version of \\"Life in Technicolor\\" has presented itself, it's even more clear that it's Martin's stab at giving his group their own \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\"; for the record, this version seems much better than the one they actually used.  \\"Rainy Day\\" sounds really cute, and \\"Glass of Water\\" sounds pretty nice, but neither amounts to a lot.  The most exciting piece is \\"Lost+,\\" which is the same as the real thing, only with a Jay-Z rap over the geriatric Edge-solo-wannabe.  \\"Postcards from Far Away\\" presumes that people are digging Coldplay so much that they'll even be happy to hear a quaint 48-second piano piece--and they're probably right.  Still, \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground\\" sounds like an aggrivatingly foolish statement for Martin to make, especially since his premonition \\"People talking without speaking/Tryin' to take what they can get\\" in the title track sounds like he's describing his own band.

0893860220|3.0|The Amazon reviewer, Stephen Wingate (Boston, MA USA), wrote -     \\"Nisargadatta Maharaj's \\"I AM THAT\\" is the last spiritual book you'll ever need to read. Congratulations, you've reached the end of your search!\\"    No doubt there are other such blindly enthusiastic reviews for this book on here, but this one was the first that caught my eye.     I must disagree with the man and say that unless you would like a book wherein idiotic questioners (some of whom are also naive Westerners) play verbal tennis with an Indian guru and do nothing but march in circles of stupidity, this will certainly not be the 'end of your search'.     I have the book, and while Nisargadatta Maharaj has some interesting things to say in accordance with his particular system of self-realization, the questioners ruin the entire thing by constantly asking the dumbest of questions and Maharaj, possibly for his own entertainment, allows it. The entire thing reads like a sort of Three Stooges routine. Here's an example:     Q: Yoga helps in the search for and the finding of the self.  M: You can find what you have lost. But you cannot find what you have not lost.       Background: the questioner here mentioned that he rebelled against Christianity and Christians and took up an interest in Yoga, in which he includes the entire arena of Indian thought. He also learned Hatha Yoga from and Indian teacher in America and began teaching it for his own livelihood. This is a familiar story: get bored with Western religion and turn to the groovy East for a replacement. The questioner is on a very, very basic level in his 'spiritual' development. He mentions that, although he has not stopped his seeking, hatha yoga gives him peace of mind. Maharaj shatters this delusion by saying that seeking is restlessness and that his alleged peace of mind is really only the temporary absence of tension. The problem is that, unless you are also in the very early stages in your understanding of these things, the book readslike children asking dopey questions, receiving complex answers, and then asking more dopey questions which voice their confusion over the answers. Over and over and over again for close to four-hundred pages.        Perhaps I'm biased on this issue because I dislike question and answer scenarios on these topics. The questions are universal and have probably occurred to most people treading the territory, but to get caught up in questions, and their answers, and then the questions related to those answers, and the answers answering the questions about the answers, is a tiring and meaningless process. There's simply no need to go on this big head trip like this if you have a real urge for the so-called self-realization. At the most, the words in any book on the subject can only lead you to the point where you feel it is entirely unnecessary to read anymore about it. A point comes when reading is seen as actually moving away from the goal. Just a mind play. Feeding the mind more questions - other peoples' questions that were previously non-existent for you! - and then rattling around more answers in your head. This is getting trapped in a maze.     Perhaps the book is good after all, you will feel so exhausted reading all the stupid question and answer games that you'll throw it down and dive inwards inquiring into who the \\"I\\" is that is disgusted with the book and to whom or what that sensation of \\"I\\"-ness occurs.

0740748475|5.0|I had been looking for a collection of Calvin & Hobbes and decided to take a chance since this one was on sale. I'M SO GLAD I DID. THIS COLLECTION IS FANTASTIC! The Complete Calvin and Hobbes (Calvin & Hobbes) (v. 1, 2, 3)      The binding is beautiful, built to last many years. The printing is clear and sharp, the colors just pop off the page. It is a size that allows easy reading. The sections are arraigned to keep sequential themes or story lines intact.    You will not be sorry you invested in this terrific set (all 24 pounds worth!). I like this one so much I intend to purchase several more that are offered from the same publisher. BUY IT NOW; or you will regret it later when it's out of print!
B000I0QK74|5.0|Currently I am renting a small space and have stored non-essential items in a storage unit.  Unfortunately this holiday season came and I had no Christmas ornaments, decorations, music, etc.  I ordered this CD to help me through the holidays.  I absolutely hate the Christmas music that you hear in retail stores trashed by pop singers.  My taste tends toward traditional carols, Mormon Tabernacle Choir, or maybe Boston Pops. This selection of songs was a real treat... soothing, festive.....typical James Taylor.  I definitely recommend it!!
B001ECQ75A|5.0|Movie was in A1 condition.  Arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  Children enjoyed the movie.
B00006CXSS|5.0|In excellent condition and came on time.  Great movie.  Who wouldn't love an action packed historical view on the events of the past.  Two thumbs up for sure....
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This was an excellent movie.  I think Christian Bale is a great actor who went above and beyond to make his character and the performance exceptional.  I've seen it on cable many times but I still wanted to purchase the movie to have in my Library.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm a Kelly Clarkson fan, and have been since I first saw her perform on American Idol.  She was the first and ONLY contestant that I've ever voted for.  one reason: THAT VOICE.  That girl can deliver a song!  Thankful was an \\"ok\\" CD, but seemd to only scratch the surface of Kelly's potential (The Trouble with Love, Low, Anytime, Just Missed the Train and Beautiful Disaster are standout tracks from this album).  Breakaway was a great improvement, though not perfect..it took all the strengths of her first album and magnified them times 10.  My December, in my opinion, is her best album to date.  No Fluff, No Sap, just real, raw emotion.  She shows her edge, but there is also a tenderness and fragility there, you can actually feel what she is singing (just listen to Sober, Maybe and Irvine to see what I mean). Get this album...you will NOT be disappointed.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|Both Cristian Bale and Heath Ledger gave outstanding starring performances, with Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman also appearing at the top of their craft.
031606792X|4.0|If you enjoyed the Twilight saga, you'll love the last book of the series. It's an easy read for those who want something entertaining.
0956010903|4.0|I bought the collector's edition for myself because I love the whole HP series and wanted to keep it going.  The book is very cool.  The packaging is beautiful and as close to the original as I would believe possible.  Is it worth $100?  Is it $100 worth of product?  Probably not...unless you are a collector too.  It is worth it to me though, especially since the proceeds go to charity.  The actual stories are quaint.  Not what I expected...not as much to them as I expected there to be, but I am glad to have the set.  If you're someone who loves to have the books on your shelves for you and your family, then buy the collector's edition.  If you just want to read the stories...buy the paperbook, or go to the library.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|We purchased the DVD Wall-E as a gift for our grandson.  He said it is \\"neat\\", which is good.  All I had to go on was the name and that it should be widescreen.  \\"Neat\\" means we did good.  Maybe we will get to see it when we visit him.  Thank you for your help.
0956010903|5.0|The book is great and the stories are fun. The only complaint is not about the book, but about Amazon's packaging. It was supposed to be a Christmas Gift and the box clearly said what the content was and ruined the surprise. We should have been warned about this.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie is a tearjerker but it is so sweet, it has beautiful scenery and the acting is great.  Loved it!
B000ATQYT2|3.0|I love this movie, but when I watched it, there was a very important scene edited out of this version and I am very upset.  I would return it if I could and get another version.  The scene that is missing is a musical number when Scrooge and his girlfriend part ways during the Ghost of Christmas Past's visit.
0739370642|5.0|I consider my time to be precious.  Any book I feel worth my time is a good one.  Larsson's book kept me reading to the end.

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|\\"Mamma Mia\\" is thoroughly entertaining! As you watch and listen to the scenery and music, you'll want to get up and dance.  Meryl Streep shows that she is the consummate actress.  She can do it all! It's the kind of movie you'll want to see over and over because it makes you feel good.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|The extra $5 was worth the fancy cover that transforms from movie hellboy to comic hellboy.

B000PC8AFU|4.0|Another great CD with various cuts with other musicians including Albert and B.B King, and brother Jimmy to name a few. Classic songs and a must for a SRV collection.
B0012E2HRC|2.0|Read the book instead... it's much much richer and better done.  Clint is awesome... but the book simply is perfect!
0312330537|2.0|Shantaram is an ambitious novel. Unfortunately, Gregory David Roberts' 900+ pages of ambition suffers from a lack of competent editing, or perhaps from no editing at all. To be sure, there are sections of the book that are engaging and fascinating, such as those that describe Lin's (the protagonist) experiences as a Bombay slum doctor or his visits to the Standing Babas and his friend Prubaker's village. But there are an equal number of dull, repetitive and poorly written passages. Roberts' tendency to describe what every female character is wearing in every scene is mind-numbing, as is his tendency to write about the femme fatale's black hair and green eyes ad nauseam. (\\"Tall plants as green as Karla's eyes whirled and shuddered in the wind all around us.\\") The dialogue is often forced and unnatural; supposedly meaningful conversations between Lin and Karla are plain laughable. Long stretches that explain a major character's philosophy are excruciating and rehashed several times. Numerous and implausible fight scenes starring Lin (the author?) left me exasperated.  Unnecessary background information is presented and soon forgotten as it is becomes impossible to keep track of the many shallowly developed secondary and tertiary characters (although even most of the main characters display a lack of depth). In short, at half the length this could have been a real page turner. As it stands it's a rather frustrating, overstuffed mess.
B00005YJMX|5.0|Quick service.  Quality item.  5 stars.  Not Murnau or Browning or Shrek or Lugosi, but it comes together beautifully.

0545128285|5.0|It was pretty ingenious of J.K. Rowling to write a collection of stories which appear in the last Harry Potter book.  It was a delight reading some more HP-related stories.  After the last book, I was left with a sort of void, asking myself, \\"What will I read next?\\"  'The Tales of the Beedle the Bard' is written with such authenticity, it's almost believable that these stories have actually been passed down for generations as genuine fairy tales, much like the stories told by Brothers Grimm and such.    A quick, light read, yet completely enjoyable.  Along with afterwords by Albus Dumbledore, they're stories which will both entertain and educate.

0439023483|5.0|This is definitely a first for me, I bought and thoroughly enjoyed a book recommended by Stephen King!  King wrote a positive review of the book for Entertainment Weekly.  I was skeptical, as the premise sounded like [[ASIN:0374529531 The Lottery and Other Stories]] meets [[ASIN:0399529209 Lord of the Flies (50th Anniversary Edition)]] (with a little of King's own \\"Running Man\\" thrown in for good measure), but when I found it half price at a store closing I took a chance.  What this book has, that I found lacking in the first two I mentioned, is hope.  The heroine of \\"The Hunger Games\\" holds tight to her integrity and the good things in her life, like her sister.  I was gripped from the very first page, and riveted until the last page. I am so glad there will be a sequel.<br /><br />Collins creates a very realistic future dystopia.  Global disaster and war have destroyed civilization and a new nation has arisen from the ashes - Panem.  The ruling Capitol is surrounded by 13 districts.  These districts rebelled over 70 years before, and were defeated - one completely wiped out.  The remaining districts were forced, in addition to providing goods and materials to the Capitol, into providing two tributes to annual Hunger Games.  A girl and a boy between 12 and 18 years old who will fight to the death on live television.  When Prim \\"wins\\" the lottery, Katniss steps up to take her little sister's place.  Her fellow tribute is a boy who once did a selfless act of kindness toward Katniss that she feels indebted for.  How will she be able to kill him?<br /><br />At first the concept seems outrageous - would people really watch young children fight to the death for entertainment?  What makes the book so scary is that people likely would.  Reality TV has been riding a wave of popularity.  Millions tune in to Survivor to see them lie, manipulate and sabotage one another to win.  Horror movies rake in millions at the box office and the more blood and death, it appears, the better.  Is it so difficult to imagine people killing for not only a prize, but to save their own lives?  Gladiator games were the number one entertainment during the golden years of the Roman Empire.<br /><br />Yet, the author never lets the absolute depravity of what the Capitol is doing stray from readers minds.  Katniss believes it is wrong, even as she fights to survive, and her acts of bravery are only equaled by her acts of humanity.  The story is simply, and powerfully told.  Katniss is realistic and her dialog and thoughts are those of a sixteen-year old girl, albeit a mature one.  The book has a lot of action, and the emotional content is strong.<br /><br />Overall, I can't recommend this book enough.  However, the subject matter can be disturbing so parents may want to be sure their young adult is ready for it.  I have already pre-ordered the sequel, [[ASIN:0439023491 Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]].difficult to imagine people killing for not only a prize, but to save their own lives?

B001GQ2TGA|2.0|It is disappointing that most Enya's songs have become so mainstream, easy and simplistic melodies that lack depth and originality. She is best when doing those dark, eerie tunes in non-English languages.
0765318741|4.0|This is one of those rare cases where I saw a movie before I read the book it was based on.  I enjoyed the film with Will Smith, but it was totally different than the book.  To me, the film was more about the triumph of the human spirit; one man fighting for humanity.  The book is more of a philosophical examination of what it means to be normal - part of the majority.  Matheson chose vampirism to be his plague, but really, he could have chosen anything.  The question becomes, is a person still normal when the rest of the world is different, is it right to keep fighting against change?<br /><br />Robert Neville is perhaps the last man on earth.  He has barricaded himself in his house, and each night it is surrounded by vampires waiting for their prey to emerge.  He wrestles with not only survival, but his very sanity.  He needs a purpose to keep going, and finds  it in a search for answers.  Vampires were legends - but perhaps they were real all along.  What causes vampirism?  Is it just a bacteria? If so, how does he explain their fear of religious artifacts?  The novel is written almost like a journal of Neville - only in third person.  There is a lot of descriptions of what he does day to day, what he is thinking (or trying not to think about).  Gradually, pieces of the past are put together for the reader to see how he came to be alone for 3 years.  In the novel, there are 2 types of vampires - those infected but still alive, and the undead.  The difference between them is crucial to the resolution of the story - though not necessarily in the way a reader may expect (or the way the movie ended).  In the movie, the vampires are ravening, seemingly mindless creatures that the audience can easily side with Neville against.  In the novel, they are intelligent and see Neville as a threat to their existence.  Who has the right to survive?<br /><br />I think what made the novel most worth reading was finding out just what the title meant.  The movie never explains it - the book makes it pivotal.  Overall, the book is very slow (much like the movie) but makes a reader think more about what is happening than simply watching one man try to survive.  And I highly recommend it - if only to know the ending that really needed to occur.<br /><br />Given that I Am Legend is a short novel, this edition is very nice for the inclusion of several other Matheson short stories.  Even though Will Smith doesn't look like Neville as described in the book, I'm still happy to see him on the cover!it pivotal.

B000TXZVGQ|4.0|What a great trip back in time.  I mean, I don't know if I should have been laughing this hard at the show, but when I am watching it, I crack up thinking about what an idiot I was in high school.    Oh poor unfortunate me! hahahaha!  This is a great collection, and would make a great gift for anyone.  It is a timeless story, because it is about the teenage condition: Self obsession, whining, and a false sense of emotional depth.    If you went to school in the 90's though, it is an absolute laugh riot!
B0012QCZ54|5.0|My 17 year old loved this movie, it is a great gift for teens who love dancing movies!!
031606792X|5.0|This was a very pleasing ending to a saga. Nothing left unresolved. This could have easily been 2 books instead of one. I wish there was more to read!
B001DHXT20|4.0|Action packed and entertaining.    Loved that homage was paid to both Bill Bixby and Lou Ferrigno.  The aggression was a bit much (too intense) for me but if you're making a film about the Hulk, I guess there's no better place for it.  It remained true to classic Hulk in it's ending - which I admired.
0439882826|5.0|We saw this book at B&N before xmas and my son loved it.  So as a xmas suprise I got it for him, much cheaper here by the way.  This book is the coolest pop-up book I've ever seen, there are pop-ups on each page, as well as 4 smaller ones on each corner of the pages... this thing is so cool!  The pop-ups are freakin huge too!  The light saber's also light up which makes it even cooler!  If you or your child like Star Wars, or pop-up books get this book!  You won't be disapointed.

0956010903|4.0|I bought this book back when it came out for my girlfriend. and overall i think it is an awesome looking book. the stories are very short and i wish there was more, but eh ohhh well, i think 100 dollars was a little high, but to know you have something that not everyone has is nice to know. but for someone like me, i wouldn't say it was worth it, because im not that hardcore of a harry potter fan. The book looked fantastic just like the real one, i almost did not want to open it lol. but if your a hardcore potter fan and have the extra cash, get it, because it might be even worth something down the road to you or someone else, if your someone that just likes to casually read, stick with the standard one, they are almost identical only difference is the CE has writting in it thats italic that makes it look like the original, (gives it a fancy look thats all)
B000BUYP4Q|4.0|In this latest batman installment forget the past because it's dead. Director Chris Nolan takes this genre into a new direction. Batman Begins is full of batman's roots and the path that lead him to the cape and cowl. There is high caliber acting and a philosophy that everything should be possible despite it not being very probably. Batman isn't some skinny popular actor who can only adjust his voice to baritone or throw a phony punch. He's an intimating specimen that looks tough enough to handle Bruce Lee. Fighting isn't about show but about quick bone crunching to get the job done. Plus he does lower his voice a lot.   Christian Bale (batman) is spot on as a believable gritty force that literally puts fear into criminals. Michael Cain plays Alfred to the tee as an enduring figure of wisdom and strength for Batman. All the other actors' deliver honorable to exceptional performances except for Katie Holmes who is flat from start to finish.   No campy one liner's and cheesy fight scenes in this blockbuster. The fighting is hard hitting and visceral. The writing is thoughtful and full of laughs. This isn't a story where you can guess what is going to happen next. You're taken on a ride and when it stops you'll be begging for more.      Side Note: Isn't a comic book movie but a great action/drama based on a comic book movie. Good flick whether or not fans of the comic book.    Extra Features: This holds a lot of cool extras from Bale transformation physically to his fighting choreography plus much more. Batman Begins two disc is definitely worth the extra money for the special features.

B000MRAAJM|5.0|Despite finishing this 11-part series on Blu-Ray a few weeks ago, I still shake my head in amazement at the things I saw on these discs.    Obviously, the incredible photography and sharpness/color (please see this on high-def, if you can) is the first thing that captures the viewer's eye, but as the series went on I appreciated the objectivity in here. The writers and narrator David Attenborough just present the world as it is, with no preaching. The beauty of this earth says it all, and the writers were smart enough to figure that out during this series.    After viewing 11 discs, you come to the obvious conclusions that in the Earth's world of animals, birds and fish come only a few objectives: where to find food, water, a mate, and escape being devoured by a predator. That's it, except for pets or zoo animals. On land or in water, it's simply a matter of survival, as this BBC series shows us.    What makes this so special is that, thanks to incredible work by cameramen, we are privy to many extraordinary sights we would never see, if left on our own, and never imagined existed on this planet. Much of this series is simply mind-boggling to view, especially all the overhead shots, which were stunning, especially in high-definition.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|As usual, Amazon.com has the best price anywhere, by far!  I couldn't be happier with the boxed set (a Christmas gift for my daughter.)
068484267X|5.0|This was one of those best-sellers that truly lived up to its hype.  Frank McCourt's prose and his incredible story of growing up very poor in Ireland, is one for the ages.  Over 1,800 reviews of it here on Amazon tells you something.    If you missed this book - and the hype has longed died down over it so there is a chance you may not hear about it these day - take the word of reviewers here and take notice of all the awards the book won: this is good stuff!    Rarely I have read a book with so much sadness, humor, sweetness and tragedy all rolled into one.    The storytelling here was so good that a movie was made (almost word-for-word with the book). a sequel to the book was written and documentaries have been made about the McCourt family. In addition, Frank's ultra-crazy brother Malachy also wrote about his adventures.    I know it sounds like a cliche, but this is a story you will never forget.

I used it in my DVD player and I tried it in another DVD player and the same defect came thru in both players.  The DVD is basically worthless with these defects.     What makes it worse, is that it was a Christmas gift for my grandchildren.    I will never purshase merchandise from this venue again.
B001GQ2TGA|1.0|I own almost all of Enya's music, a mix of classical, pop and modern choral and solo music.  They all are a mix of moods and feelings.  This CD was like a death dirge. I was so depressed after listening to it I threw it away.
B001DHXT6G|2.0|I was very happy to get this product for Christmas for my boyfriend, we have watched many of the special features on the disks. My only complaint was that for the $200 I spent the condition of the box of the first season was damaged. It was cracked in several places and the inside box was damaged just a bit, the dics were all fine just the packaging could have been handled better.
0375826726|5.0|The language and imagery is quite beautiful, and is probably the strongest point of this novel. There is indeed a plot, but not much action, which represents a change of style from the first volume of the series. The book falls into the same general class as Patricia McKillip.

B000IOM0WE|5.0|I was skeptical walking into this film, I thought it was going to be one more mindless action film where the good guy stops the bad guy and it's one big happy ending.<br /><br />But I thought this film had a lot more to say than its \\"paper-thin\\" plot had to tell. It's a meditation on chaos and order, on what it means to be human, on love and shows the world a glimpse of a future where man does not overrun the planet.<br /><br />A lot of flack is leveled at the performances in this film, but I felt that by the end of the film its dreamlike quality had been fully embraced and earned.<br /><br />Try and give it an unbiased chance. Don't compare it to the show. Think of it as a love story with a Sci-Fi backdrop NOT a Sci-Fi film with a love story thrown in.<br /><br />Oh, and it looks beautiful on Blu-Ray.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|I swear my movie going experience has become fewer and far between. There are not many movies that interests me. 2008 was a pretty rancid year for movies IMO. I could count on one hand the times I went to the theatre to see a movie. Of the five films I have seen, my favorite film of 2008 is the Swedish film LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is based on the John Ajvide Lindqvist novel which was originally published as LET ME IN (before it was re-published as LET THE RIGHT ONE IN). John is also responsible for writing the screenplay for the film and I am glad he did. Anyone else would have destroyed the story (I can imagine that will happen with the American butchering of LET THE RIGHT ONE IN).<br /><br />The film adaptation centers around 12 year old Oskar (Kayre Hedebrant)who is friendless and is constantly bullied by three of his peers at school. His torment is so bad he takes out his frustrations on a tree at night with a knife he had appropriated. One night outside in the frigid cold, Oskar meets 12 year old girl Eli (Lina Leandersson) who had recently moved into his apartment building with an adult male companion named Hakan. Initially the two youngsters are wary of each other but eventually they become friends. What Oskar doesn't know at the time is that Eli doesn't look like what she appears to be and through out the film, the viewer is given subtle glimpses to who Eli really is as a person.<br /><br />I have read the book and Tomas Alfredson pretty much stays true to the story (with the help of the author himself). There are definite huge chunks of the book left out but probably because Lindqvist wanted the film to focus more on the relationship between Oskar and Eli. I truly loved the film and the storyline. I love how Tomas manages to balance the horrors of Eli's dark, vampire nature with her tender relationship with Oskar. The film is driven by a beautiful classical film score by John Soderqvisk which captures the lonelieness, joy, and terror that comes with the film. The child actors of Kayre and Lina were wonderful to watch. I really enjoyed Lina's performance as Eli which was often heartbreaking especially in the last fifteen-twenty minutes of the film.<br /><br />LET THE RIGHT ONE IN goes beyond just being a horror film. It is also a character study which the Swedes are quite famous for in their films. I saw this film twice in the theatre and that is rare for me. I am not the horror fan that I once was but I actually enjoyed all of the more violent scenes especially the one involving Virginia and a bunch of cats which made me laugh out loud. Some people might not like the pacing of the film but I found it to be just perfect. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is worth viewing and reading. For me this is the vampire film from 2008 that is worth viewing.the film. The child actors of Kayre and Lina were wonderful to watch.

0786838655|5.0|Rick Riordan has melded the ancient Greek gods and twenty-first century American middle school perfectly in this book, the first of four in the series (Sea of Monsters, Titan's Curse, and Battle of Labryinth). It is no wonder almost all of my middle school students for the past three years have loved this story about a twelve year old boy with a classic middle school wit and sense of adventure who discovers he is the son of Poseidon. Percy Jackson is a true hero: he has a set of middle school troubles-dyslexia, ADHD, poor grades, a mean step-father, teachers who seem to be against him- but once he finds out all his troubles are because he is a half-blood, son of a God and a mortal, he takes on all the tasks his destiny requires of him without flinching.<br /><br />Well liked by both boys and girls, the four books in this series are written at a fourth grade reading level with  an interest level of grades six through eight. Younger kids will be able to read it but may not fully appreciate the sense of middle school angst and wit that pervades the story. However, it is a great book for middle school students who have never found a book they liked as well as enthusiastic readers who enjoy Greek myth and stories of non-stop adventure. The three books that follow are as well-liked as the first which makes this an excellent book for getting a young reader started on a path of reading for pleasure.<br /><br />Gaby Chapman

1420925288|4.0|It has been said that this book is one of Oscar Wilde's classics and I do say it is. The story revolves around one man and his desire to be young. Although it was originally published in the 1800's, the themes and ideas within the book you can adapt to today's time. I have underlined many quotations that I found very interesting and if thought about make sense.<br /><br />Now, for those who know or don't, it has been made a movie before and it has been revived this time around as a movie set to release this year with the lead character played by Ben Barnes (The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian). Ben Barnes was known for Prince Caspian and this is his next movie to release. Also starring, Colin Firth.<br /><br />I would certainly read this book first before seeing the movie and for a price like this, you cannot take advantage of reading a great literary classic.
1582701709|5.0|My outlook on life is changing for the better because of this book.  After a series of upsetting life issues that have caused me to withdraw from life in general, this book has shown me other ways to think and I am noticing that I am now happy again.  I am expecting great things to happen.

B000UBMWG4|1.0|Like quite a few others I received this set with the primary 1st disc being in fact a duplicate of the 5th disc which is just a workcut of the film. Amazon quickly sent me a replacement. But that set has the same issue. Disc one has different and correct artwork so it appears the manufacturer had some issues when they printed these discs and there are a glut of them out there. I sent Amazon another e mail to see how to proceed and don't know how that will go since they apparently won't do a refund for this order and a third replacement seems likely to offer the same problems. But buyer beware if you are planning to pick this set up through Amazon right now. Not sure if other retailers are having the same issue also.
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|Funny and Charming...nothing less than what you would expect from Jack Black. An all star \\"voice\\" cast, but \\"Po\\" the panda has got to be the favorite. Jack Black brought his entire self to this character, and was entertaining from opening to finish. Even my 2 yr old, who doesnt really care about TV or movies, enjoyed himself, laughing at the \\"SLOW-MO\\" parts. Invest in this movie. You will not be disappointed!!!

B000EWBKM6|5.0|Will and Grace will always be a classic TV show. This season finale was wonderful in that you got to see the characters, Jack and Karen do something you didn't really get to see ever. I miss Will and Grace and so does my daughter. But.. all good things must come to an end. This is just a wonderful ending to a great series.. Enjoy it..
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn was a wonderful ending to the Edward/Bella romance.  I only wish the story continued.  I have questions such as; what would Edward think of Bella now that she lets him read her thoughts?  What happens to Renesme and Jacob?  Why didn't the Cullens destroy the V-clan from Italy? Edward finally got his dream in the end.  The book was about sacrifices that each person makes inorder to continue the love story.  I thought it was creatively written and can only hope that Bella appreciates all of Edward's generosity and sacrifice.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Good DVD. I was glad I could order online since I live 30 minutes from the closest place to buy it and it is always cheeper on Amazon.
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I selected this turntable as a birthday gift for a dear friend. He is a real music conniuseur! There is something that you get from vynil that you just don't get from cd's. A richer sound....the bass drum so deep...the vocals as if you are in the same room with the vocalists! This turntable is amazing and it is certainly \\"not your Dad's turntable\\"! This is a really great product and anyone who is looking for a turntable so that they can break out the albums will be perfectly delighted and amazed!
B001F1YBP8|5.0|I have several Classical Music & Operas in my DVD collection.  Enjoying all of them.  I found the Brandenburg Concertos 1-6 BLU-RAY while browsing the internet and decided right away to purchase it assuming it would be superior to a DVD both in picture and sound.  To my amazement, this Blu-Ray \\"knocked my socks off\\".  I had recently purchased a largescreen TV and WOW, the PQ and the sound quality was superb.  Claudio Abbado is one of my favourite conductors and watching the \\"super clear\\" expressions on his face and the faces of the musicians is really exciting to watch and hear.  I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray DVD to anyone.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Although not quite as good as other Pixar moview, I still enjoyed this movie because of the graphics and special effects. I believe the premise of the movie was faulty and depressing, because it indicated that earth would soon be taken over by trash, so it might not be a movie for everybody. I could look beyond that and enjoy the characters.
B000O179A4|3.0|Received prompt delivery.  Since the movie was so highly rated and had good reviews, I was a little disappointed, as it just wasn't to my taste.  Excellent acting, well done -- just not something I'd want to watch again.
B0009KQOMO|5.0|This movie pretty much has everything. Action, love and saving the Earth. I have watched this movie many times and don't get tired of it. You will not be disappointed.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|It has to be one of my favorite movies.  The acting was the best.  Everyone told me it was really dark, but I really liked it.  I felt like it explained a lot of things that the regular series never touched on.  I don't think it is for young kids esp. if they are the types to get scared, but for teens and adults...I give it a thumbs up!
B0013NAP2G|4.0|I gave this dvd to my sister, who is a die-hard Mariah fan, so of course she absolutely loved it. I went in a bit more wary, but this was a surprisingly good concert. There isn't much dancing, and she does sort of just walk back and forth, but her voice makes up for all of the flaws. I'm not that big a Mariah fan, but I look forward to watching this dvd again with no problem.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|It was great.  I really got a lot out of watching it without interruptions.  Things made more sense to me.  The extra's are really good.  I think I enjoyed watching those just as much as the TV series.  Very interesting and informative!
B00004RFFS|5.0|this transaction was very easy. the product arrived in mint condition and was shipped very fast! the price was the best I could find anywhere.  I would definitly use your services again.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Imagine this: a man stretches a cable between two buildings at a height of a quarter of a mile, walks out to the middle, and lays down on it. What kind of a man could do such a thing? That is the question director James Marsh asks, and answers, in this superb documentary.<br /><br />In doing so, he skillfully blends present-day interviews with footage and photographs from the past and re-enactment that is so good it takes most of the film before one realizes that some of these scenes could only have been re-created with actors. This is documentary storytelling at its very best.
0670033049|5.0|My son had this book on his Christmas wishlist.  It was something he had been hesitating to buy for himself.  As and avid reader, and someone who has spent many happy hours reading Mr. Steinbeck's classics, I did not hesitate to purchase \\"East of Eden\\" for my son's library.  He was very pleased with the gift.  It arrived on time and in great shape. (I really think everyone should read \\"East of Eden.\\"  Its pages contain some of life's greatest lessons, in my opinion)  Thank you!
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is truly an awesome blu-ray. Taking a classic and putting it in high definition only heightens the quality of a near flawless trilogy. I highly recommend experiencing this classic all over again in high definition!
B001DSNF8C|5.0|This is a must-have. The movie itself is incredible as usual.  The action sequences take it to the limit. Craig is better than expected as Bond. The disc itself is great - plenty of features - although I have not sampled that content as of yet.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I could put most of the music to somewhere in the movie, which doesn't always happen when I listen to a soundtrack.  There are two reasons I gave this four stars instead of five.  For one, you can barely understand a word in the song by Rob Pattinson.  And two, I wish Bella's Lullaby was longer.  The length of the song is about half the length of the other songs, and the mood of the song fits much better with the movie.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is a series I have wanted since I saw it on HBO when it first came out.  I was finally able to get it and have not been disappointed.  The nice Metal case this particular one came in is very nice, and will help protect the dvd's for a long time, although this makes the dvd's on the bottom a bit of a pain to get out.  I highly recommend the Band of Brothers to anyone who wants to know more about WWII and what those brave men went thru to keep the rest of the world safe.
B000VBP382|3.0|When I first heard there was going to be another adaptation, my first thoughts were that nothing could top the '95 miniseries with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.  Especially since that one was 5 hrs., and followed the book to the tee!<br /><br />  Well, of course this one was cut down to a measly 2 hrs.!!  Because of the time constraint- they had to rush the story along, almost at a fast-forward pace (or as someone aptly put it: \\"didn't allow the story to breathe\\").<br />Surprisingly, I didn't find it that big of an issue.<br />_________<br />There were a few notable changes however...<br />**SPOILER** First, the part where Mr. Darcy first proclaims his love to Elizabeth is a bit different than it was in the book (the setting that is).<br />Second, the confrontation between Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lizzy is customized (for the sake of time).<br />Also, (towards the end) the part where Elizabeth confesses her changed feelings towards Mr. Darcy is different than in the book; and the end was also tweaked a bit.<br />_________<br /><br />  For the most part I was pleased with their choice of actors.  Dame Judi Dench was a perfect Lady Catherine (too bad she didn't have more screen time)!  I really enjoyed Rosamund Pike as Jane.  Simon Woods as Mr. Bingley, although a tad naive and silly at times, is nonetheless endearing.<br />Unfortunately the rake/villain of the story- Mr. Wickham (Rupert Friend) seems to only have 5 minutes screentime.<br />  Keira Knightley just isn't selling Elizabeth for me (as Jennifer Ehle did)!  I don't sense much emotional depth, or connection in and to her character.  She does show her teeth a lot, and sometimes in a most unbecoming way (or as one reviewer stated \\"baring her teeth\\").  KK's roles- at least the ones I've seen her in- all seem to blend together.  In the end there's really nothing positively memorable about her performance.<br />  As for Matthew Macfadyen, my only experience of him prior to this, was a smaller role in the miniseries based on Anthony Trollope's \\"The Way We Live Now\\".<br />Instead of coming off aloof and haughty as CF's Darcy; MM's portrayal is introverted/introspective.  I actually found it endearing (which might be a bit off the mark from what Jane was originally going for in this character). Truthfully, it was a little too easy to get lost in his \\"fine eyes\\"!  Nevertheless, he is now my second favorite \\"Mr. Darcy\\"!  (If you haven't already, check him out in the latest BBC adaptation of Charles Dickens \\"Little Dorrit\\" - he's absolutely brilliant in his role as \\"Arthur Clennam\\"!)<br /><br />  All in all it's a good movie- especially for those who don't have the patience to sit through the 5 hr. one.  But there is lots of holes and gaps to fill in, so for a faithful retelling of the book, one really should check out the 1995 miniseries!<br />  I'm also really pleased with the \\"special edition\\".  While there's not a whole lot more DVD extras than on the original; the added book, and soundtrack make the purchase worthwhile!Now\\".

B000G8NXZK|5.0|Brazil is by far in my opinion director Terry Gilliam's best film to date.  To receive this kind of treatment by Criterion is great for anyone who loves this film.  The addition of the \\"Love Conquers All\\" version of the film is great touch and really puts Gilliam's battle with the studios into perspective.  This set is a bit pricey for the casual movie fan, Criterion offers a way cheaper one disc version of the film for those, but if you love cinema and love to collect then get this set.
B0017CW5J4|5.0|Great find. We could not find this in the stores.  It is hard to find blu-ray music in stores because  they say it is still so new. We enjoyed watching  this a great buy.
B000UR9T82|5.0|These movies never looked better on this High Definition Blu Ray Set. One thing I would like to have seen would have been a digital copy disc for these movies but I guess that was not in the cards. Overall Spiderman is one of the best comic movies that have been done. You won't be disappointed with this set.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|The Dark Knight(2-Disc Special Edition) is a gr8 addition to anyone's DVD collection.....

Definitely A good collector's Item.

B00008FWRW|5.0|A masterpiece. An impeccable and vivid recording, with songs that blend toghether obsessives, hypnotics elements (never boring) at mixed tempos(4+3, 3+2) with a fluidity that is disarming, songs that vary the intimate painful, resulting in powerful explosions never ends in themselves. Slow, malincholy, strength, all in one. Minimalism has never been so fascinating.

031606792X|4.0|I will admit that the Breaking Dawn had a different feel about it when compared to the first three books, but still I enjoyed reading. Edwards and Bella's relationship did seem different but it in no way made me feel like they loved each other less.  You can't have the very same relationship as they had in Twilight, it would have shown no growth.  I am glad the author decided to show the growth of characters, even if some may not have agreed with it.      Some parts were hard to believe, the idea of Bella getting pregnant because she still seemed so young.  Maybe the books should have been directed to an older audience if they idea of her having a child was going to cause so many issues with the readers.  She was married however, which is not sending a bad signal. During the prenancy she did seem like a different character, but she had to make some changes for the new member of the family.  Above everything else, this is a book; it is meant for enjoyment.  Although some things could have been done differently, I am pleased with the outcome of the final book.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|My copy was totally unviewable. I almost immediately received a replacement, which was exactly the same. I purchased 3 DVDs and 1 CD, only 1 DVD was not defective, and the replacements for all were also defective. I emailed Amazon about the replacements, and have heard nothing back.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|My family had recently watch season 1 of West Wing, renting it through Blockbuster video.  We tried in vain to find season 2 of West Wing to rent, so we decided to buy the series.  It was on sale through Amazon at $15 per season right before Christmas, in individual boxed seasons.  My wife then found this collectors set with all 7 seasons in one nice package.  We have been EXTREMELY pleased with the quality and features of the set.  Each season comes packaged in its own fold out sleeve or divider, with a bonus disc at the end giving details about the show and certain episodes.  There also is a book depicting what is on each season and on each disc, a brief TV Guide synopsis so to speak.  There also is a booklet containing information about the show, each character and various other interesting information.  All-in-all, you get much more detail and information with the collectors set versus individual season boxes.  I love it and if you are a West Wing fan as we are, you should absolutely buy this.
1416955070|5.0|I found both this book and its sequel to be well written and impossible to put down.....I wont reveal any of the plot, but I will say that the book is excellent for anyone who likes lots of imagery, fights, magic, mysteries and plot twists...The book integrates everything that you see in scifi/fantasy including vampires, fairies, magic, werewolves and many other things....I have read other young adult novels, and found that this novel seems to be written for people who are older than \\"young adult\\"....Other books that I have read and found interesting include Graceling, the Twilight series, Vampire Academy, the House of night series, Wicked lovely, and other related novels....This book and its sequel far surpassed the other novels with its complicated plot and numerous well developed characters, action and even has some romance thrown in (it would probably make an excellent movie)...I would suggest this to everyone who enjoys scifi/fantasy books!
B001F7MSG6|1.0|This was probably one of the worst flicks I've seen this year... still can't figure out what the target audience was supposed to be.  But apart from that no real extra stuff on this bd version  (So you get bored of the extra's aswell)
031606792X|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  So much so that I read the whole series two times in a row to ensure that I didn't miss any idea connections. I thought it was going to be more of the same as the Twilight book however the story grows in an interesting and charismatic fashion.  I couldn't put the books down.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This is one of the best movies of the year--and obviously the highest grossing movie of 2008. It's a movie mixed with drama, mystery, action, horror, and a bit of comedy to lighten the tone from time to time. The acting was great, with the Joker role being the highlight.     The DVD itself was reviewed as pretty limited by other sites, but I thought it was fine; however, I usually just care about deleted scenes mostly, which weren't on the disc. The added IMAX scenes was a nice touch, but I didn't notice much of a difference from the standard; I guess you needed to actually watch it at IMAX to get the full effect. I don't foresee me using the digital copy anytime soon, but most people who watch movies on a portable device would find this helpful.    Regardless of the argument about special features on disc 2, I would highly recommend The Dark Knight and watch it every time with anyone who hasn't seen it.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|My hubbby's favorite!  Great price!  Speedy delivery!  Highly recommend!  Thanks so much!

B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Of course I loved this feel good movie, which I had seen on the big screen, a better way to see this type of movie.  We hadn't gotten very far into the movie when the DVD started skipping.  It settled down a little later and my daughter and I enjoyed the rest.  No one can beat Meryl Streep at ANY type of movie.  If you haven't seen this and are a fan of musicals, this movie is for you.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Loved the movie... need I say more?? A total favorite in our household. 2008 brought in AMAZING kid/family flicks (Horton  Hears a Who, Wall-E, Kung Fu Panda to name a few-all three are a must in the family dvd library). LOVE the digital copy! Amazing picture with the Apple TV   To be fair though, you have to be aware that its a quiet and relaxing film. It doesn't have the action that Pixar is known for. However it meets all expectations in the \\"emotions\\" department! Such great feelings being emitted from Wall-E. Is there a cuter robot out there?!?!   I loved the concept of WALL-E being more \\"human\\" than the people. And (maybe a stretch) that the robots, who did the day to day chores and maintenance, were more capable of being \\"human\\".  Never  a dull moment when you are watching a Pixar masterpiece! TWO THUMBS UP!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|What's to say about Emmylou Harris.  She is a national treasure and this album is outstanding and a statement of who she is.  Thank you Emmylou!
B000AJIAOO|5.0|Vocalist Sharon Den Adel may be the best female vocalist in any genre of music. Besides a few other impressive singers (such as Catherine Nyland of Mortal Love and Cristina Scabbia from Lacuna Coil) Adel can easily be called \\"the best female vocalist\\". Many singers don't sound as good live as they sound in the studio. However, Adel, as well as the other above mentioned singers sound just as good live as they do in the studio. Adel has good vocal control and does not seem to go beyond her vocal range.    Within temptation is one of the most talented bands who, to my delight, have no cookie monster growlings. The background vocals (including the male singer) are their \\"natural\\" voices.     Band members include:  Sharon den Adel   Robert Westerholt   Ruud Jolie   Jeroen Van Veen   Stephen van Haestregt   Martijn Spierenburg     This is a five star product-
B0011NVC9I|2.0|It's just not much of a movie.   I will resell my copy after watching it once.
B000089RVX|5.0|First, I can't compliment this album and the band enough. While Amy Lee does not have the vocal control of (Catherine Nyland from Mortal Love or Sharon Den Adel from Within Temptation) she does have a beautiful voice. Her live vocals are not as good as her studio vocals. However, she was around 22 or 23 years old when Fallen was released. her live vocals may have improved significantly since that time.     Amy Lee has a soft, unique voice that fits well with the keyboards. Further, Evenascence is the best metal group that is currently played on U.S. radio. An added plus is the lack of \\"cookie monster growls\\" that too many bands use. Leaves Eyes has a male singer who growls in the background. I can tolerate this because Liv Kristine only uses his vocals sparingly. On the other hand, I have not heard any Amy lee song with a guy who sounds like cookie monster in the background-thank goodness.    This is a five star album
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|We bought this after a request from our son.  He loves it!  We've watched it, too and thought it was a great movie.
1933492279|5.0|The future has never been so close as in this pictures!!!  The cure of the details is simply shocking!
B000059LGC|5.0|What a beautiful film. The plot, the acting, the music, the costumes, the scenery...all artful.   The story by Agatha Christie is gripping and breathtaking.  The acting is excellent.  The costumes and scenery (specially night scenes) are almost perfect.  The most unforgettable moment was when Poirot said:  \\"We almost know all there is to know...\\"  It's been 4 years since I first saw this classic but I still treasure it and really do not know for how long I will  go on seeing it.  Definitely recommended.
B00003BDXG|1.0|The strange part is, that I actually tried to like this movie. I'm a big fan of Oliver Stone's work. He picks the most exciting and intelligent subject matters to tackle. You don't have to agree with the man's politics or artistic psychology to like his movies. His movies have helped to open the hearts and minds of audiences to events,subjects, and themes that  would normally go unnoticed or unheard of. Even if you don't agree with his opinions on those things, if he made you want to find out about those things for yourself, mission accomplished. So I tried my best to see what he saw in this absurd and excessively violent script. I watched the movie like five times (twice with Oliver Stone's commentary), and I still failed to see his fascination with it. The characters and events in this movie are as unpleasant and offensive as hell! There's not even a real political,social, or moral message to justify all this sadism and carnage. What was Stone trying to say? That deep down everyone is just as violent and depraved as Mickey and Mallorey? The fact that I hated this movie proves that theory false. I took no pleasure in the movie's savage violence. It was tasteless and completely pointless. What else could he be trying to say? That the media is responsible for creating and glorifying mass-murderers? Well if it does, then this movie is no better than the media it attacks. Oliver Stone practically makes Mickey and Mallorey out to be heroes! He even gives them a happily ever after ending! I think someone should tell Mr. Stone to not go pointing the finger of accusation at anyone or anything until he reflects on his own actions to see if he is really any better than the people and institutions he's attacking. He really fumbled the ball with this artistic disaster. All the more sad, because the guy that made JFK,Nixon,Alexander Revisited,Born on the Fourth of July,Wall Street,Talk Radio,Any Given Sunday,Platoon, and World Trade Center should have known better!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|My husband and I saw this movie back in August and absolutely loved it, so we decided to purchase it. I highly recommend this movie!
1600241824|4.0|This CD set was great for my roadtrip. I laughed so hard that I had tears in my eyes! It also still has that special sentimentality that David Sedaris's voice adds extra meaning to. However, there are parts that are downright gross and it is not for the faint of heart, I now have a phobia of boils.
B000ETQR3Q|5.0|My 10 year old go this for XMAS and LOVED it.  He put it together himself and was on to Nerf shooting everything in sight.  The Nerf battles have been on every since.  This is a great toy for boys, although it's BIG so little hands will have trouble holding it, but for larger boys it's a win-win.
B001EL6EH2|5.0|One of the greatest films comes to Blu Ray----in an incredible transfer.  I've never seen this film look so crystal clear.  The audio transfer is crisp and clean as well.  I've had the luxury of seeing a restored print shown in Hollywood, but never thought I'd see that clarity again.  Bravo to Warner Bros. Home Video----for a change they got it right!      Extras are terrific and the packaging, while being a little cumbersome, is fun. I compared it to my old DVD, and it was a huge improvement.  So much so that I bought it for a friend as a X-mas gift!!     For those who don't own it, get it.  For those who haven't seen it, see it.  This is one of the most perfect films ever made.  Brilliant acting, editing, camerawork, music, lighting, and an awesome script loaded with some of the greatest lines ever captured on film.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|2 caveats before I start this review:    1. I'm not going to delve into the whole compression/distortion/clipping issue here.  It's been argued to death.  I will say yes, it certainly is a valid concern.  Listening to the CD on my home and car stereos, I did not notice the clipping, however when I ripped the disc to my mp3 player, what came out of the earbuds was an unlistenable mess.  I *do* believe that the Guitar Hero mix is superior and listen to it more often than the actual disc.  But that said, this review is about the MUSIC only.    2. I'm a fan of all 'eras' of Metallica.  Obviously, I bow down before the first 4 albums as stone-cold classics and metal landmarks.  However, I'm also a fan of their later work, and I count \\"Load\\" among my favorite all-time Metallica records, along with \\"Puppets\\", \\"Justice\\" and \\"Kill Em All\\".  I actually *liked* St. Anger, despite its obvious productions flaws.  But that doesn't make me a 'fanboy' as so many on the internet like to proclaim anyone who likes any music that they made after \\"...AJFA\\".      Now, onto \\"Death Magnetic\\".  This was one of my most personally anticipated albums in several years.  I was curious to hear the direction the music would take, because I knew that 1. It wouldn't be another St. Anger, 2. It wouldn't be another \\"Load\\"/\\"ReLoad\\"-style record, and 3. I knew it wouldn't be a *complete* return to the progressive-thrash days of 'MoP' and 'Justice'.    Upon first listen, I immediately heard ALL of those influences on 'Death Magnetic'.  It's almost as if they took parts of all their different sounds over the years, put them in a blender, and came up the the ultimate 'Metallicocktail', if you will.  There's the relentless agression of 'Kill 'Em All'.  The progressive arrangements and tempo changes of 'MoP' and 'Justice'.  The big choruses of the 'Black Album'.  Some of the more bluesy riffage from the 'Load'-era.  Even a little of the raw nakedness we heard on 'St. Anger'.      The record starts out with atrio of the strongest tracks - \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", \\"End of the Line\\", and \\"Broken, Beat, and Scarred\\".  \\"TWJYL\\" opens the record much the way \\"Battery\\" kicked off 'MoP': a slower, haunting guitar passage that suddenly gives way to a vintage James Hetfield thrash riff.  The track comes at you like a freight train, giving way to a blazing Kirk Hammett solo and climaxing in some very Justice-ish twin-guitar riffage.  \\"End of the Line\\" is another standout, mixing it's swaggering, Load-ish main riff with the thrashing tempo and Hetfield's best vocals on the album.  \\"Broken, Beat, and Scarred\\" fits its title.  More bouncy, crushing riffage and Hetfield spewing out the song's signature line : \\"What don't kill ya make ya more strong!\\"  It's an old cliche, but he sings with with so much venom that it sounds fresh.  First single \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" is up next.  It's a song that was obviously modeled in the tradition of \\"Fade To Black\\" and \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\", right down to it's position as the 4th track on the album.  A vintage Metallica \\"ballad\\" that gives way to a furious thrash ending.  \\"All Nightmare Long\\" follows, and this is one track that even the most jaded, cynical Metallica fan could not deny is a winner.  A furious, galloping thrasher with raging, gutteral vocals from Hetfield.    \\"Cyanide\\" is one of my favorite tracks from the album.  I've heard many people call it 'filler', but for my money this track is an instant Metallica classic.  A stomping anthem with a great melody, killer riff after killer riff, and a furious, blazing solo that may be Hammett's best on the album.  This is what \\"Seek and Destroy\\" would have sounded like if it was on \\"...And Justice For All\\". Next up is \\"Unforgiven III\\".  Some may scoff at the very notion of a 3rd installment, but I see it as Metallica's tribute to Clint Eastwood's \\"Man With No Name\\" trilogy that they so admire.  \\"III\\" certainly outshines \\"II\\", as the riffage is less derivative of the original and theKirk Hammett solo at the song's climax is a wah-wah drenched masterpiece.  Generally I think Kirk uses the wah far too much, but it's perfect here.  I hear more \\"Justice\\" style in \\"The Judas Kiss\\" with it snake-like guitar patterns, but the chorus is pure 'Black Album' in its melodicness as Hetfield commands \\"Bow Down!  Sell your soul to me!\\"  Up next is Metallica's first instrumental since \\"To Live Is To Die\\" from Justice, \\"Suicide and Redepmtion\\".  While this doesn't quite match the heights of \\"TLITD\\" or the brilliant \\"Orion\\", it still takes the listener on a ride throughout it's 10 minute running time, weaving through sludgy, stomping riffs that are almost reminiscent of Alice in Chains at times.  Finally, the record closes with the shortest track \\"My Apocalypse\\", a furious thrasher to close the album a la \\"Dyers Eve\\".  This one is so relentless I even hear a bit of Slayer in it.    All in all, sonic issues aside, this album is a masterful triumph for Metallica.  I won't call it a 'throwback' or a 'return to form', but rather a smoldering stew of many sounds that have made Metallica great over the years.  It's heavy, it's aggressive, it's raw, it's unbridled...it's GREAT.

1400063515|5.0|[[ASIN:1400063515 The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable]]    This book is especially relevant in these \\"turbulent\\" economic times. In a way, this book is an example of the subject which it discusses, in that it is far removed from the conventional or \\"normal\\" book on the role of chance in our lives, including the financial realm. It will make you think harder than you ever have before about your comfortable assumptions concerning \\"randomness\\". But more than that, it will teach you to be a better critical thinker by practicing skepticism daily. I have been using selected readings from this book in an informal \\"seminar\\" on the current financial \\"crisis\\", and it has provided many very useful contributions to the discussion. As an engineer in aviation safety, I am very interested in the unexpected and the unanticipated, and the tradeoffs between the costs of preventing accidents and the costs of having them happen. Although this book does not directly discuss this particular area, the principles it espouses are very relevant. I highly recommend this book for a thought-provoking and enjoyable read.
B000TGJ80I|3.0|I really, really liked the theatrical release of Underworld, so when I finally got a Blu Ray player I picked it up on blu ray pretty quickly.  While the visual and audio is fantastic, I wish they had not added in the extra footage.  None of it was relevant or really entertaining--I don't need to see Kraven and that blond floozy making out for 6 minutes at a stretch (I'm not a prude, but jeez, it was BORING--no T&A, no character development or plot advancment...what the heck?).  The rest of the extra footage was pretty much the same--pointless and boring. There were bits and pieces of scattered throughout, but it really all belonged on the cutting room floor. It made the movie less enjoyable for me.      The picture quality was great, the audio quality was great...but I just want the theatrical release, not the extended. There's a reason stuff gets edited!
B000AADYYO|5.0|Well this album is amazing.  Amazing riffs. Amazing vocals. Amzing everything! Opeth is amazing
B0012GVKW8|2.0|I'm reviewing the blu ray more than the movie; pretty much everyone knows what it's like.  But this transfer...oh my god. It has more grain than a wheat field.  The picture's fuzzy, and on my 50\\" tv it barely looked any better than the DVD version of the movie. There's also NO real special features, just a theatrical trailer,  so there's really no point in buying the blu ray. Maybe someday they'll clean it up more, but this transfer sucks.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|This movie was the best Batman movie yet.  It was a little dark and disturbing but great none the less.
B000WQWPKA|3.0|Idependence Day is more or less pure brainless entertainment, and that's all it's meant to be. It does this very well, with fast pacing, lots of explosions and interpersonal drama.  The effects have held up a lot better than I'd have thought they would as well.  It isn't a movie to watch for social commentary or anything like that: pop it in, grab some beer and pizza and enjoy.    The Blu Ray version of the movie is *very* impressive. They added a little bit of extraneous footage but nothing damaging (I think it was probably just a few minutes total anyway), and the picture quality was above and beyond what I'd expect.  This particular movie helps show how nice hi def can be on a big screen, better than most. There are details I just never could have made out on DVD.  I didn't think the audio was as impressive as the visual, but it was still certainly decent. They obviously cleaned up the source material before pressing to Blu Ray. There aren't a whole lot of extras, but this isn't the sort of movie to really benefit from those anyway IMO.
B00006LLOB|5.0|Being a big Blues Fan and Howlin Wolf Fan, this is a great CD.  It was done in London and has a host of great musicians on it.  Most of it sounds spontaneous and as if they are jamming away.  I think it's great.<br />It has Clapton, Charlie Watts & Bill Wyman (Stones)and more.  Even Ringo sits in on some.  Make sure you read the insert that tells the story of setting these sessions up in 1970.<br />I highly recommend it if you like Blues and Howlin Wolf
B0017APPT8|4.0|It's a fun movie, even if it isn't a cinematic masterpiece. Just a joy to watch, it's well paced, funny and slick.  It has undercover agencies, aliens, and Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones,a nd lots (I mean lots) of jokes and a touch of action and mayhem.  Gotta love this classic summer fun flick!    The Blu Ray edition is stunning; while some of the special effects didn't age as well as I'd have liked, picture quality and sound quality were both phenomenal, noticeably better than DVD.  Colors were crisp, there was minimal grain and noise. Watching this on my 50\\" plasma was a total blast.  This was hi def done right and a great showcase for the capability of blu ray.  I haven't really explored the extras much, but they seem pretty normal--commentaries and the like. Fox should take lessons from this and fix some of their abysmal transfers (Predator, I'm looking at you!).

141690977X|5.0|(to the tune of \\"Alice's Restaurant\\")<br /><br />...And friends, somewhere in America enshrined in some little bookstore, is a study in black and white of men's indiscretions and apathy.<br /><br />And the only reason I'm telling you this now is cause you may know somebody in a similar situation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a situation like that there's only one thing you can do and that's walk up to the guy you've been prostrating yourself and your goals for, just walk in say \\"You can get anything you want, just not at MY restaurant.\\".  And walk out.<br /><br />You know, if one person, just one person does it they may think she's really sick and will ignore the scenario.  And if two people, two people do it, in harmony, they may think they're both lesbians and they'll write a little porn fantasy about it.<br /><br />And three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in<br />letting these men know we're onto them and walking out. They may think it's an organization.<br /><br />And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day,I said<br />fifty people a day walking in telling them its cool you that I'm not a priority, because I'll get to find someone who will make me a priority and<br />walking out.  And friends they may thinks it's a movement.<br /><br />And friends, that's what this is: the \\"'He's Just Not That Into Me' movement\\"!<br /><br />----<br />It may take a bit, but you know, this may be feminism's endgame -- the one where we take our sanity back from the 'would be's' who are abusing our womanly sympathy, charms, and patience, all so they can feel like they aren't going to hurt us?  Please. Men are going to find out how strong we are, and how sexless their lives can be if they don't a)get their priorities straight (which might not include include us, and that's cool), or b)grow a pair. And given the popularity of the book -- this may be sooner than later.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|Determination, patience, obsession, talent, and lots of hard work.  These are the words I can think of to describe this wonderful film.  The incredible story of Phillipe Petit and his helpers is something to behold.  Both the interviews with them and the re-enactetment of their incredible adventure that took place thirty-five years ago are beautifully captured and told.  It is pure poetry.  Plus, as a bonus, the viewer will be able to watch his previous experiences as well.    This is a most enjoyable experience!

B000WZAE0Y|5.0|Sometimes we are blind to the truth.  The truth is better, so we shouldn't be attached to a bad reality. Enjoy!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie I saw back in Sept at a film fest and over time it stuck with me.  There is so much that makes this film wonderful and sweet.  Oskar is a character that you can't help but embrace, nothing was in his favor til Eli came along and his blind love for her is all the more sweeter as he discovers her secrets.     TO those that keep mentioning Eli's \\"caretaker\\" they need to pay more attention,  the man is also not the father but a LOVER of Eli.  This is not a sexual film its about emotions and the purity of love, so that kinda removes the creepy factor of the old man and a 12 yrold girl, ok still a little creepy.     This film to me is perfect and the thought that Hollywood wants to americanize this is a shame because the studios WILL SCREW THIS UP.  This film deserves all the praise it has recieved and then some.  Its bleak in some respects but that is life.  I agree this isn't much of a traditional horror film and it shouldn't be thought of or viewed as simply a horror film but as a film reflecting the innocence of childhood and the heart of what companionship, friendship, and any relationship should mean.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I'm the first to admit McCartney is often difficult to defend.  Just when he produces something amazing (and I would consider every album he's put out since \\"Flaming Pie\\" amazing), he says or does something dopey that undermines his creative efforts.<br /><br />He is a true Gemini, persistently torn by oppositional tendencies.  It's not an exaggeration for me to state that I think he is the greatest composer and musician (or at least bassist) of any musical form of the past 50 years.  Even though much of his solo and Wings-era work embarrassingly strains to retain the middlebrow sensibility that made the Beatles so commercially successful (which of course was only one component of their appeal), there is a certain genius even in his most seemingly conventional songs (I'm thinking \\"Let 'em In,\\" or \\"My Love,\\" songs I love in spite of their reputations).<br /><br />But, because he possesses (or used to possess) a finely tuned ear for what appeals commercially, he's been terribly stigmatized as a lightweight (thanks in no small part to unbearable, pseudo-elitist and pompous critics like Robert Christgau...what a jerk...) to the extent that the \\"other half\\" of McCartney is constantly ignored or at least overlooked, often by McCartney himself.<br /><br />That's why it's such a relief to finally see the critics and the public at least begin to acknowledge McCartney's \\"other side,\\" and that he is fully capable of producing a work that is so thoroughly resistant to convention.  There was always a weirdness to McCartney's mid- to late Beatles work that doesn't get enough attention, and he delves into those long thought lost peculiarities here with a vitality that is peerless.<br /><br />McCartney's two sides are fused here, really.  \\"Sing the Changes\\" and \\"Dance til We're High,\\" for instance, are beautifully textured works of ambient nuance that simultaneously, with very their McCartney-esque melodic hooks,  could and should be massive hits.<br /><br />Of course, considerable credit should be afforded Youth.  Their chemistry is such that I hope the collaboration expands into still-greater territories.ir chemistry is such that I hope the collaboration expands into still-greater territories.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Great Movie, not for Kids.  My husband loved it as a  Christmas present.  We would recomended even if you do not like superheroes movies.
B00011F5DK|5.0|After doing a search for games for gifted kids and reading the reviews about Blokus, we bought this game for our family for Christmas. We have thoroughly enjoyed it. Our 5 & 7 year old kids enjoy it and understand the concept of planning your strategy, although they don't always put it into practice. I enjoyed the game a lot more before my husband got so good at it. :) When the kids get tired of playing, he and I play it using the 2 player game rules (we each play 2 colors) and really enjoy it. This is a great family game for a wide range of ages. I was a little surprised it cost so much when we first started considering it, but it's worth it.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Coldplay reminds of the Moody Blues back in the 70's but with today's technology and punk intertwined.   The harmony and the instruments are artistic and refreshing.   If you haven't listened to clips off this album you should.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I LOVE this movie.  The characters are terrific and the cinematography is breathtaking.  The songs will stay with you. The story is adorable. Get it and watch it and watch it and watch it again and again.  Guaranteed you'll love it too.
B001GZ6QC4|3.0|Maybe it was the hype of the movie, or Heath Ledger's untimely and tragic death, or both, but I was anticipating MORE. Ok, maybe it was the time of day that I watched it (almost 10pm) and I was tired, and a tad bit sleepy, or maybe I should have seen it on the big screen, in the theater, or maybe Bale's brush with the law distracted from the movie (although I don't think people remember that), but I was just expecting a little more. Now don't get me wrong, I am not saying that it wasn't good, but it just didn't knock me off my feet, like the first Batman did. It seemed that Bruce Wayne's character was really developed in the first one (Batman Begins), while it wasn't this one (he seemed at times to be just going thru the motions). I will admit that in Batman Begins we learn the genesis of Batman and his life as Bruce Wayne so there was no need to restate it, but none of the other characters were really developed in this one, we only got snippets into what led to their development. For example, you did begin to understand who the Joker was, but I don't think that there was anything to really explain some of his psychotic behavior besides the fact that he was crazy. The same goes for Dent's character...yes, I understood why he became \\"Two-Faced), but I didn't think enough was there really explain how a person who fought so hard for justice would suddenly (although the loss of a loved one could do it) turn so wrong.     Quickly, I will add to my list of what I liked and disliked about the movie.     1. While I don't think Batman \\"evolved\\" much, I do enjoy how Christian Bale plays the role. He effortlessly waivers between being a \\"playboy\\" (Bruce Wayne) and brooding/conflicted superhero (Batman). What I really liked about Bale's portrayal is that you can feel the internal conflict between being a superhero and being yourself. He constantly seems to be questioning should he continue his crime fighting ways/living with a secret/alone/no tangible family (with the exceptionof Alfred and Fox) or settle down and start a family (virtually giving it all up). I would seem being Batman costs Wayne everything including his love. And while he struggles to balance his desire to save \\"Gotham\\", with his desire to be normal, you sympathize. And while his dilemma is not different than Spiderman's, Superman's or any other super hero, you like his take on it.   2. I know that people are going to comment, but I preferred Katie Holmes over Maggie Gyllenhal as Rachel Dawes. I thought Katie bought a certain innocence that Maggie attempted to recreate but didn't do it successfully. Did that merit my average rating? No. Who played Rachel's character really didn't make a difference, although her character was vital to the storyline and explained the evolution of \\"Two-face\\".  3. I still enjoyed Gary Oldman as the dedicated Police Lieutenant, and although I was saddened by his character's fate, I definitely think that he was one of the shining stars in the first Batman and in this one.   4. To me, Heath Ledger gave an interesting spin to the Joker character. While Jack Nicholson was an effective Joker years ago, Heath seemed more tortured because he was not just a pretty face in makeup (with a drawn on smile), but a disfigured and relatively angry bad guy with issues.   5. Gadget man Lucius Fox (played by the earring wearing Morgan Freeman) was brilliant and captivating as usual. I especially like the relationship between he and Batman. When the caped crusader (or is it masked) asks him to \\"create a suit where I can turn my head\\", I smiled. There definitely seems to be a mutual respect and admiration between them.    6. Michael Caine, as Bruce Wayne's handy assistant (Alfred), and guardian of Batman's truth, was equally brilliant.   7. Aaron Eckhart, as the dedicated and incorruptible District Attorney Harvey Dent was great, as was genesis to \\"Two Face\\".     While I know some don't think this is necessarily the place to \\"review\\" movies, I do think that the\\"average\\" consumer would want to know more than \\"was the quality of this DVD worth buying\\"? When I look in Amazon, I want to know both what the movie was about and the quality of the product. Meaning I am buying the movie, not just the DVD itself. With that said, I have found that unless you buy the two disc editions, you are always going to be cheated on the extras. In the past, the extras were almost as good as the movie itself, but now, unless you pay a little extra (note the difference between $15 or so dollars, and $24 dollars), you aren't going to get the alternate endings, outtakes, interviews, etc.. So if you want all that, you will have to pony up the extra bucks to get it. I for one find that once I see a movie, I rarely pull it out (unless it is one of my absolute favorites) again and re-watch it although I have paid the money, which explains why I now go to \\"on demand\\" or rent it.      But after all is said and done, I would give this a solid 3.5 or 4.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|Another great serial killer movie staring two of the BEST actors ever! I strongly recommend this movie to any fan of serial killer movies, don't believe the critics reviews on this movie! Great stars all around in this movie and Pacino/DeNiro are definitely at their best!
0312383320|1.0|With a sticker price of almost $29 and even with a discount price of almost $16, Plum Spooky is another waste of money.  At 309 pages, it is the first full length, between the numbers, book featuring Diesel and the world of Plum.    The Plum series used to be fun books.  Wonderful to read.  Deserved to be read many times.  They were purchased.  They were keepers.  I loved them.  This series of books had many dog-eared pages from being lovingly read many times.    To me, Plum used to represent a book filled with wonderful characters, heart pounding fear, laugh out loud till I cried moments, fantastic one-liners from Stephanie, Lula, Ranger, Grandma Mazure, Vinnie, Connie, and Morelli.  Words like edgy, sexy, funny, witty, sharp, thrilling, and emotional filled my mind as I read.    This book is another episode of the three stooges, running amok in the world of Plum.    Well, on with my difficult-to-write review.  Synopsis:  It is a sad, sad day when an author who gave us the Plum series has to issue a book filled with monkeys and characters that revel in gross bodily functions.    This book takes place in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey.  It should be very scary.  It's not. The characters that live in the Pine Barrens should be scary.  They are not.  E. Bunny (retired Easter Bunny), Sasquatch (retired something) and, good grief, there is Elmer The Fire Farter!  They are not scary.  They are ridiculous.  The villain is Gerwulf Grimoire.  He is supposed to be scary.  He's not.      There is a lot of Lula and Tank in this book.  But who are They???? Tank lives in a cute little old lady bungalow, has three cats, carries their pictures in his wallet and Tank sweats a lot.  Lula sneezes and farts throughout the book.    Of course, Carl the Monkey is back.  He's not alone.  There are a lot more monkeys.  Wearing helmets with antenna's.  Morelli?  Yup, he's in there.  He's babysitting his loser, cheating,  brother Anthony.  Ellen/Helen Plum's in there.  Drinking whiskey disguised as ice tea.  Connie and Vinnie are in there.    Ranger.  He's in there. I'm assuming that when he told Janet he wanted to pass on being in this book, she didn't listen.  He should have begged.    It goes without saying that Stephanie Plum is in there.  She is apparently in an on-again with Morelli, sleeps in bed every night with Diesel (no sex, of course) and yet still relies completely on Ranger to always find her and keep her safe.    Diesel.  Diesel is cute, sexy and funny.  He needs his own world. Janet should have argued more with her publisher on this.  Quite honestly, Plum does not need a third alpha male.    I have a suggestion for you, Janet Evanovich.  Take your old Plum books off the shelf.  Starting with One for The Money -  read them.  Then go back into your office and write.     When the next Plum book is released and I take it off the bookstore shelf, I want the pages between the front and back cover to be filled with the great Plum writing that I loved.  The stuff that earned you that best selling status.  I want a great book.     Plum Spooky is silly, slapstick nonsense.  It might appeal to a lot of readers.  If you like silly slapstick, the three stooges and stuff like pull my finger jokes, you will love this.      But is it the Plum that I have know and loved for years?  No it is not. Doesn't even come close.  It's juvenile and drivel.      Simply put, this was the last Plum book I will read until I get to read reviews that tell me that the nonsense and slapstick is over and the World of Plum as I knew and loved it is back.

B000002GQJ|4.0|I take this album as I do all seven Moody Blues LPs from '67 to '72: a creative endeavor that stands solidly on its own.    And I don't compare one against another (although I insist with utter conviction that everything after \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is not even in the same solar system as the classic seven).    But \\"A Question of Balance\\" is unimpeachable in terms of classic Moody melodies and superb musicianship, from Justin Hayward's furious guitar strumming in the opening \\"Question\\" to Mike Pinder's pinings in \\"How Is It We Are Here?\\" and \\"Melancholy Man,\\" to the closing \\"Balance,\\" with Pinder's wonderful narrative taking on all things cosmic as reflective of the time -- 1970.    Yes, the band took their creativity to higher planes with their last two efforts \\"Every Good Boy Deserves Favour\\" and \\"Seventh Sojourn,\\" but even so, this one has a rightful place on the altar of the classic seven.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Love, love, love this mobile. I just got my new Rainforest mobile in the mail today and immediately put it together and set it up for my 2 month old son. He loves it! I had to get a new mobile because the one I bought to match my crib set was a pain to wind up every couple minutes... So I searched for something that played on it's own.<br /><br />I was deciding between this mobile and the \\"Tiny Love\\" mobiles but ultimately went with this one because it had a light, remote, a longer timer, is battery operated, and cheaper! I also read the reviews of both and I agree that the speed on this one is just perfect, as is the music, sounds, and the volume. I also read on reviews for the \\"Tiny Love\\" mobile that people had problems with it falling on their baby, but the Rainforest mobile seems to be very strong and sturdy and I made sure to put it together exactly like the directions tell you to.<br /><br />I also think the animals and moving leafs are so adorable. Great choice for me! And my baby loves it as much as I do!
B00007G1ZC|5.0|Dreams is a profoundly personal film by a hugely significant filmmaker in the twilight of his career and life.  Akira Kurosawa was a wonderful producer, director, and screenwriter who created great films for fifty years; including such classics as [[ASIN:B00005JLMU Ikiru]] and [[ASIN:B00003CXC6 Rashomon]].  In fact, I would assert that there are arguably at least five films on Kurosawa's staggering resume that would be called masterpieces if created by even the most acclaimed filmmakers of today.  Dreams was made in 1990 and was one of his last movies (his final film being [[ASIN:B000059H7C Madadayo]] in 1993).  It is important to note that I did not know who directed Dreams when I first saw it, but was just as impressed.<br /><br />The film is apparently based on various dreams that Kurosawa had throughout his life.  The first is Sunshine through the Rain and follows a young boy who witnesses a kitsune wedding.  The second is called The Peach Orchard and takes place during Hina Matsuri or the Doll Festival.  A boy's family cuts down their peach blossoms before the festival and dolls from his sister's collection become animated.  The Blizzard follows snowbound survivors on a mountain whose will to live is tested by a mysterious female spirit.  The Tunnel tells the story of a dead soldier returning from war.  The Crows includes an appearance by Martin Scorsese as Vincent Van Gogh.  This stunning vignette follows a Kurosawa-like character that travels in and out of Van Gogh's paintings.  The nightmarish sequences include the apocalyptic Mount Fuji in Red and The Weeping Demon, which both no doubt touch on crucial cultural anxieties regarding nuclear technology.  Finally, Village of the Watermills ends the film with death, but also with jubilant celebration of life in general. I'm tempted to assume this is just Kurosawa's subconscious literally translated to the screen.<br /><br />The images in Dreams are carefully symbolic and although they don't form one message at large, it does provide broad lessons and general wisdom.  It also provides some absolutely gorgeous cinematography.  I found it refreshing, even for Kurosawa, that the film's primary mode of communication was its visuals.  These images are beyond words but so few masters execute this medium flawlessly enough to actually pull that off.  This is not for everyone but I highly recommend it to anyone anyway.provide broad lessons and general wisdom.  It also provides some absolutely gorgeous cinematography.

B0015FWRHS|5.0|This CD was listed by Downbeat Magazine as one of the best jazz CD's for 2008. I would highly recommend it for those who enjoy hearing a jazz trio play mellow, flowing sets with nice transitions between the trio members. There is also outstanding \\"knowledge\\" by each trio member, realizing what the other member is trying to play and complimenting the music making the trio sound as one unit. Some of the bass playing by Avishai Cohen really stands out on Puncha Puncha and Variations in G Minor, reminding you of other great bass players such as Eddie Gomez (played with Bill Evans). Other songs such as Eleven Wives have a \\"Bad Plus\\" feel to them. So if you like Bad Plus, but wish you could find a more mellow and listenable Bad Plus, then this trio CD is a must for you. Overall, every song and the whole CD weave you in and out of great interplay and transition playing by three excellent musicians. An excellent CD.
0393324818|5.0|I must confess - I'm not a huge fan of baseball.  Indeed I purchased this book for my father.  However, once I began skimming the book - I became hooked.  I read it cover to cover in only a couple days.  This book showed 21st century statistical methodology as it is brought kicking and screaming into the game of baseball.  I find it amazing to believe that any major league operation would not have changed its system of evaluating talent after this book became published, and yet given the entrenchment of old fashion beliefs, its probably still the case.  Even if you are not a fan of the game - but have an appreciation for excellence in operational management - this book is an excellent read.
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books (and my mom's all time fave), and I've seen several film adaptations. The book is so rich and complex that I don't think any of them do a perfect job, but this one is worth seeing. Both the leads do a good job, especially Ruth Wilson as a convincing Jane. The director did some interesting things with symbolism which I actually liked. However I have to say it's not that much better than any of the others I've seen (I particularly like the Timothy Dalton, the William Hurt, and even the old black and white with Orson Welles) and I felt after I bought the dvd that I probably should have just rented it because I don't think I'll be wanting to re-watch it that often.
0141180870|5.0|F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"The Beautiful and the Damned\\" was published in 1922 by Charles Scribner. It is written in a naturalistic style by the 26 year old author who had risen to fame due to his first novel \\"This Side of Paradise.\\" That novel chronicled the life of a Princeton man.<br />  This long 450 page work deals with the lives of Anthony Patch a Harvard graduate who wastes his life. Anthony refuses to work depending on an inheritance from his wealthy grandfather. The grandfather lives in Terrytown New York where he is a pious prohibitionist who disdains the laziness of Anthony. Anthony fears he will be disinherited with granfather walks in on a wild, drunken party which Anthony is conducting at his summer home.<br />  Anthony becomes infatuated with the Kansas City beauty the cold but regal Gloria Gilbert. She is based on Fitzgerald's wife Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald. The two wed and party their way through California and New York. Gloria is self-centered, vain and selfish. She is a materialist who wishes to be worshipped as a glorious being of sublime beauty.<br />  The Patch marriage is a disaster. They fight and spend money as if it were going out of style. Anthony's has to sell bonds to keep them afloat. He is drafted into the Army in World War I. He never goes overseas. Instead he is posted in a southern town where he has an affair with the dimwit belle Dot.

Her belated attempts to enter the movies when she fails a screen test arranged by an old beau who has become a movie producer. She fears growing old as the lines across her face warn her that all beauty is ephemeral.<br />  Both of these characters are lazy, mentally inactive crybabies. The novel ends when Anthony receives a thirty million bequest in his grandfather's will.<br />. Anthony and Gloria's romantic and emotional future is bleak though they are as rich as Croesus.

B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Batman Begins discards the previous four films in the series and recasts the Caped Crusader as a fearsome avenging angel. As the title implies, Batman Begins tells the story anew, when Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) flees Western civilization following the murder of his parents. He is taken in by a mysterious instructor named Ducard (Liam Neeson in another mentor role) and urged to become a ninja in the League of Shadows, but he instead returns to his native Gotham City resolved to end the mob rule that is strangling it.<br /><br />Batman Begins is a welcome return to the grim and gritty version of the Dark Knight, owing a great debt to the graphic novels that preceded it. It doesn't have the razzle dazzle, or the mass appeal, of Spider-Man 2 (though the Batmobile is cool), and retelling the origin means it starts slowly, like most \\"first\\" superhero movies. But it's certainly the best Bat-film since Burton's original, and one of the best superhero movies of its time. Bale cuts a good figure as Batman, intense and dangerous but with some of the lightheartedness Michael Keaton brought to the character. Michael Caine provides much of the film's humor as the family butler, Alfred, and as the love interest, Katie Holmes (Dawson's Creek) is surprisingly believable in her first adult role. Also featuring Gary Oldman as the police officer Jim Gordon, Morgan Freeman as a Q-like gadgets expert, and Cillian Murphy as the vile Jonathan Crane and Liam Neeson as the villain. Batman Begins is sure refreshing and is entertainment at it's best.
B0000YEEGM|4.0|Barry Levinson has proven again what a fine director he is.    RAIN MAN delivers quite a punch as a human drama and sort of a buddy picture, with some humorous moments.  It is deeply felt.    Tom Cruise is excellent in this movie.  Dustin Hoffman is great too.    I would definitely recommend this one.
0312427573|4.0|The Bonfire of the Vanities is the second Tom Wolfe book that I have read. The first was I Am Charlotte Simmons, which although flawed, I enjoyed. Still, this book (along with two other Wolfe titles) sat on my shelf for quite a while, intimidating me due to its thickness, as I like books that I can read through quickly. When I finally began reading this one, I found that in spite of its length, I was able to proceed quickly.    The Bonfire of the Vanities is the story of three men. Sherman McCoy is a high-salaried bond trader living with his wife and daughter in a Park Avenue apartment. In spite of his job and status, he finds himself worrying about money as it flows out as quickly as it comes in. His obsession is being a \\"Master of the Universe.\\" Sherman is also romantically involved with Maria Ruskin, the young wife of an elderly businessman.    Larry Kramer is an assistant district attorney working in the Bronx. He also lives his wife and young child, but his conditions are much different. His tiny apartment would fit into McCoy's living room. Kramer experiences a combination of envy and disdain toward other lawyers with high-paying jobs at big firms, as he would like their salaries, but feels he is on the moral high road as he helps serve the public.    Finally, there is Peter Fallow, an alcoholic British journalist for a tabloid. Fallow has been down on his luck, and his main goal each day is to find ways to get free meals. Fallow tries to dupe his boss into thinking he is being productive, and also desires a lifestyle beyond his means.    The thread that ties the three characters together begins when McCoy and his mistress are involved in an accident where he may have hit someone while driving in the Bronx at night. He is conflicted over whether to report it, while his mistress says to forget about it as they don't know if anything actually happened. It turns out that they hit a young black man from the projects who was living a clean lifestyle, leaving him ina coma. Community leaders put pressure on the police and legal system to go after the perpetrator. Fallow is the reporter who breaks the story, while Kramer is the ADA in charge of prosecuting the case. When witnesses lead the investigation back to McCoy, the case becomes about race and social class.    In telling this story, the author presents a vivid description of New York during the 1980's. Having never been there, I can't judge whether this description is accurate, but it added a lot to the story. Also, the characters are very well fleshed out. Each has his own flaws and virtues, which evolve over time. The arrogant McCoy and the idealistic Kramer from the beginning are definitely depicted differently at the conclusion.    Overall, this was a well-written novel, and I will be dusting off and reading A Man in Full and The Right Stuff (eventually).
B000NQR7NO|5.0|This album is proof that there is no such thing as \\"the sophomore curse.\\" I believe that the sophomore album is where the band fixes the mistakes they made on their debut, and that's exactly what the Arctic Monkeys did. This album was much more art-rock and experimental than their chart-topping debut, 2006's Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not, and that's exactly what I look for in a band. The album kicks off with a bang with \\"Brianstorm\\" and stays strong until track 6, \\"Only Ones Who Know,\\" the low point of the album. I'm not saying I don't like slower songs, but I still don't think the Monkeys can pull them off. Last album they disappointed me with \\"Mardy Bum\\" and \\"Riot Van\\" and I can't say \\"505\\" is that much better. But aside from those two tracks, the album is strong from start to finish with smart lyrics, twanging guitars, and fast drum rhythms. (They also get bonus points for having an album cover that really catches your eye, unlike their debut that has that guy that looks like Adam Sandler smoking...)
0887307280|4.0|Today, everyone is looking for answers to the mystery of Success.  The E-Myth Revisited is a good place to start or complete your research.  The book gives the step by step approach to working the issues.<br /><br />It's quite an easy read, but be careful, you don't miss the most important point which is presented early in the text.  Read and re-read the difference between the Entrepreneur and the Technician.  Most who aspire to be an entrepreneur are really technicians.  Michael Gerber is kind in his approach to shaking you up on this issue. I really enjoyed this book.  If you like this, then folow the book carefully and if you need discipline to accomplish them, read on to the next in the series; [[ASIN:0060723238 E-Myth Mastery: The Seven Essential Disciplines for Building a World Class Company]], and maybe you might want to look into a fast reading, workbook style business exercise system,  so pick up [[ASIN:B001BJUXHO Step Up To Success System]]<br /><br />Michael Gerber truly deserves the title #1 Small Business Guru!

B000LXH0AE|4.0|This is certainly outside of the usuall Ferrell film.  He usually plays a child man with over the top acting.  It can work for a slapstick comedy but this is a much more complex layered movie.  Ferrell plays an IRS agent who's life is being manipulated by an author, played by Thompson.  The movie is touching, funny and romatic, none of which I expected with Ferrell in the lead role.  The acting all around is great and the movie is unpredictible.  It is a truly a relief to see originality rather than a paints by the number comedy.

I also am a big fan of the tune Amazing Grace played on the bagpipes, and the version at the end of this movie was impressive--it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Some have described this as the true story behind the song, but that is not accurate. It is a depiction of the fight in British Parliament to pass a law banning slavery in that country and its territories.

0061537934|4.0|Any attempt that I make to describe this book merely makes it sound like the kind of book that I would normally avoid.  \\"It's written from the dog's point of view?  The dog longs to be human and is a car racing fanatic?\\"  Well, yes - but somehow this fails to capture its charm.<br /><br />The plot of this novel is a conventional boy meets girl/boy loses girl/boy fights for custody of his child storyline.  What sets it apart is that the book is narrated by a third part observer: Enzo the dog.  While I am not a dog person, I found Enzo to be both amusing and moving in turn.  There are limitations to this narrative device: at times Enzo had to \\"imagine\\" conversations that being a dog he was not privy to.  However for the most part, it works.<br /><br />This is a fast read and an engaging one.  Do give it a go.

0670020745|2.0|When I was given My Stroke of Insight: A Brain Scientist's Personal Journey for Christmas this year, I was quick to crack it open and begin reading. I had head many good things said on the topic of the book, and her credentials were undeniable. Unfortunately, so is my disappointment with the work itself.         The book has several key follies, and the most prominent of these is the book's indecisive lack of depth. The author, Dr. Taylor, dips back and forth between scientific fact and (extremely) anecdotal accounts. Though this is usually a delightfully effective combination for non-fiction books, both styles are poorly executed by Taylor. The fact is overly dumbed-down and spoken mostly in euphemisms meant to appeal to the lowest denominator. Somehow, this manages to make the facts even more difficult to learn. Despite a few sentences with content, the author runs in circles and repeats the same confusing mess over and over.        The anecdotal accounts were equally disappointing. Her stories lent little interesting information to the reader; instead, they awkwardly describe the author's various feelings and pseudoscientific musings. The language used in both the science and the personal accounts is bland and repetitive.          To describe the book as a non-fiction, even is pretty difficult, as many parts of the book are fantastical assumptions made by the author. The writing style, too, floats somewhere between that of a fiction and a nonfiction book. Though Taylor tries to describe with some elegance her experiences, an otherwise excellent tale is brutally marred by a poor vocabulary and an utter lack of the literary techniques (even simple ones like basic comparisons and metaphors) characteristic of informal, fictional books. However, so little is explained plainly or scientifically, it hurts to call this a nonfiction science book. Instead, I would describe the book as written by Taylor for herself (and perhaps a small selection of people helping stroke patients recover) as a sort of crude and uninteresting diary. I could have saved several hours by just reading the 40-point list in the appendix of the book- it contained every last bit of the story's meat anyway.         At a glance, however, the book does have its merits. Despite genuinely poor authorship (Dr. Taylor should definitely stick to science), it is a fairly interesting story to be told. If you decide to stop reading 3/4ths of the way through, however, don't say I didn't warn you. In the face of Taylor's bumbling repetition, it is surely tempting.

B0015OKWL2|3.0|Not a bad cop movie, but not many surprises either. Putting De Niro and Pacino in a cop movie together makes a good teaming and they both certainly have a wide fan base, but there isn't any electricity either. These guys ran on fumes the whole movie. The case isn't new, a serial killer is murdering bad guys. We have seen that in a number of movies dating back at least thirty years. The fact they think it is a cop isn't original either. Although this movie is worth a rental, I doubt most fans will buy it. Sure I was glad I saw it, but I probably won't watch it again. There wasn't anything to bring me back. I'd rather watch one of many other great movies these two have made. Good quality DVD with a few extras. If you enjoyed this catch \\"Ronin\\" and \\"Insomnia\\".<br /><br />CA Luster

See if you can guess the one I followed and the one I didn't. [Quiz answer is below the review, in brackets]    I've long been fascinated by the study of influence: what changes an individual's mind? What changes the direction of a whole society?    This is something I look at in my own organizing and writing, and when a book discusses what makes ideas last-or \\"stick,\\" in the authors' parlance-I want to take a look.    It wouldn't be the first book I'd recommend on the topic, but there's some great stuff here, all built around a formula spelled SUCCES (just one s at the end), each with its own extended chapter:  Simplicity  Unexpectedness  Concreteness  Credibility  Emotions  Stories    Oh, and to increase the stickiness of their own messages, the authors end with a sound bite/bullet point recap of the whole book in outline form. I may try that on my next business book.    For me, the two most compelling chapters by far were Unexpectedness (which includes creating insatiable curiosity) and Emotions-and Stories create a path to those other attributes. Some key insights from the former:  * The best \\"`aha' moments\\" may be preceded by \\"`Huh?' moments\\"  * When creating a message, don't think about what you need to convey-instead, think about what questions you want your audience to ask  * Keep things simple-don't do brain dumps but focus on your key point, and make sure the core message is in front  * Big ideas are audacious-but not insurmountable (Like President Kennedy setting a goal of a man walking the moon within ten years; a manned mission to Mercury would have been too difficult)    And from the Emotions chapter:  * Concepts lose value when they become clichés through overuse-but concepts can also be made fresh-as in the algebra teacher who told his students that algebra was like weight training for the mind-it wasn't aboutneeding the math skill but about exercising and challenging the brain to keep it in shape  * Talk to people where they can hear you, as the creators of \\"Don't Mess With Texas\\" did: a macho anti-littering campaign designed to appeal to Texas rednecks-but don't insult them, as did researchers who tried to bribe firefighters into considering a safety program not by appealing to the desire to save lives, but by offering popcorn poppers  * The Abraham Maslow hierarchy of needs isn't a ladder; we pursue all of them at once-so don't let your ideas get stuck in the basement-don't be afraid to tap into human desires for greatness  * Making benefits (or problems) tangible and personal is more successful than making them big  * My favorite of all: *Principles can trump self-interest*    QUIZ ANSWER: [Did you guess? I buried the lead at the bottom, but I at least hope I created curiosity]     Shel Horowitz's award-winning sixth book, [[ASIN:0961466669 Principled Profit: Marketing That Puts People First]], demonstrates how to build a business around ethics, environmental sustainability, and cooperative practices--and how to develop marketing that highlights those advantages.
1595141979|5.0|I have been pleasantly surprised that so far I found each book in this series better than the previous one.  We are definitely seeing Rose mature in this book and starting to learn how to exert at least some level of control on her impulsive manner.  Lissa's character seems to vacillate between appearing to mature and realizing the good she can do in Moroi society and back to the child who always needs to be comforted and protected by others.  We also get a hint of what Lissa's part in the Moroi royal court may be in the coming book.<br /><br />Adrian, the prince Rose met on the ski vacation, is at the Academy working with Lissa to try to teach her his spirit skills and to try and learn her healing skills.  While Christian is afraid that Adrian is putting the moves on Lissa, Adrian definitely seems more interested in Rose and possibly in more than just a passing, I want to get in your pants way.  The best part to me was to see some interaction between Rose and Dmitri that went beyond the \\"we are guardians and we can't be together\\" stuff.  It was also interesting to see that there is a start of people questioning Rose about the belief that was instilled in her that the Moroi always come first and what Lissa wants to do must always trump what Rose wants.<br /><br />Stop here if you do not want any spoilers.<br /><br />First of all I have to say I cannot believe Dmitri is now a Strigoi.  I am soooo bummed out about that and I'm hoping Mead has a twist in mind that has Dmitri either not a Strigoi or some how overcoming the evilness and need to kill that the other Strigoi have.  I really hope it's not going to be one of those lessons that Rose is going to have to face that you can't hesitate to kill Strigoi even when it's someone you once knew because that can endanger the Moroi you are protecting.  It just seems wrong to me to have an unhappy ending in a YA series.<br /><br />I'm also curious to see what will come of the secret club lead by Jesse and Ralf.  I wonder if their part was to be what weakened the wards on the Academy or if in the next book they will take a bigger part in the coming confrontation between the Strigoi and Moroi and the Moroi's that want to learn to fight and those that do not.<br /><br />I know I already said so but I still can't get over the ending.  I am on pins and needles waiting for the next book to come out later this year.  I really hope book 4 is it.  I need closure soon :)ened the wards on the Academy or if in the next book they will take a bigger part in the coming confrontation between the Strigoi and Moroi and the Moroi's that want to learn to fight and those that do not.

080701429X|5.0|I first read this book about 20 years ago, have re-read it several times and referred it to numerous people.  It's a great, inspirational read, including personal stories of spiritual survival.  -Was happy to see it's still in print.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|i could go on and on about how awesome this show is, i waited with bated breath every week.  but really all you need to know; Alexander Skarsgard is in it...also he is in the bathtub once...oh and he is a good actor and stuff as well
0312360266|2.0|First, let me begin with what I enjoyed about the book. I've read the Twilight and Vampire Academy series, as well as other vampire books. I enjoy the genre and realize it can be hard to take an old concept and turn it into something new. I like the idea of humans going through the Change to become vampires (I refuse to say \\"vampyres\\" or \\"vamps\\"). I like that not everyone survives this Change. This is a nice twist from either being born a vampire or being turned into one.     Moreoever, I like the idea of a matriarchal society where women vampires take the lead and worship a goddess. The part that I enjoyed most about the book was the descripion of the rituals and how Zoey could interact with each of the five spirits.    Overall, I think the book has an interesting concept and a lot of potential, but my enjoyment stops there. As many other reviews have said, the writing is poor. In fact, I was questioning the expertise of the editor of this book who let such shabby writing go unpolished. Too many times, the writing breaks the cardinal rule of \\"showing, rather than telling.\\" For example, at one point Zoey critiques her step-father's fashion sense, saying, \\"Well, he was wearing those really bad pants and that awful shirt.\\" Some description, please? Also, she describes one of the Dark Daughters (a member of the sorority at the House of Night): \\"She was, of course, blonde, but her long, flowing locks were more the color of waving wheat that gold. Although in the candlelight it was hard to be sure which cliche was a more appropriate description.\\" If you're acknowledging that you're using a cliche, then why use it?     In addition, every high school cliche is represented in this book: The Gay Guy, The Sweet, Country Bumpkin/Best Friend, The Black kid, The Shopaholic, The Attractive, Popular \\"Mean Girl\\" (I did feel bad for blondes in this book, almost every blonde character was automatically shallow and petty).    For example, right away we see that Zoey has a \\"Barbie-clone\\" sister that's a cheerleader. Her brother shuts himself up in his room playing video games. She says she hates them, but we, as the readers, never see them. There is absolutely no interaction. Thus, we have to trust Zoey's judgement of them.     It was frustrating to me reading this book, because I felt that so many characters had the potential to be multi-dimensional, but ended up being so flat. Aphrodite is immeditately cast as a Regina George-type character: hateful, spiteful, petty, but beautiful. There are some glimmers of dimension to her, like when she gives the impression of trying to rebel against the structure of the school, but these are few and far between. I wanted to see something dark simmering underneath Neferet's too-motherly surface. Heath is the typical high school jock, but even he had a few rare moments of depth. Zoey keeps making repeated references of how Health used to once be \\"sweet\\" before he was on the football team, and I wanted to see more evidence of that.     Erik reminded me of Zac Effron: the most attractive, popular guy in school that (of course), takes an immediate attraction to Zoey even though we're never really told why. But, oh wait, he's more than just the Hot Guy, because he likes Star Wars, so that automatically makes him a \\"dork\\" and thus, have dimension. He, too, has a stereotype, within Zoey's description of him (also an example of her mind-babble): \\"He was wearing all black, and his dark, curly hair and his insanely blue eyes reminded me of Clark Kent--well, okay, without the dorky glasses and the nerdy slicked-back hair...so...I supposed that would mean he actually reminded me (again) of Superman--well, without the cape or tights or the big S...\\" Again, another cliche description, but maybe it does work. I kept wondering what Erik's \\"kryptonite\\" was. Instead of reading about him and Zoey, I wanted to know more about this pull Aphrodite had on him, the power and control she exercised over him. That, I found more interesting and compelling.     Another point of contention I had was the pace of the story. Like others have mentioned, it needed at least another 150 pages. As it is, the plot happens in a span of 3-4 days. Way, way too fast. I like the idea of Zoey being different, of having amazing powers, but I can't comprehend that she can go from \\"normal\\" teenager to power-wielding Priestess in three days. It's just mind-boggling.    That being said, I do think the idea of this series is intriguing, and is hopefully better executed and developed in the following books. It's a light read, to be sure, and definitely not on par with the Twilight or Vampire Academy Series, but a book to try for the story if you can forgive the poor writing. (I'm sorry, Kristin Cast, nice effort, but you do not know how to sound like a teenager, or you tried too hard. Pop culture references and a 16 year-old saying \\"poopie\\" and \\"boobies\\" does not a teenager make.) I would suggest borrowing this from the library instead of buying it.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|honestly, i really only paid attention when alexander skarsgard (iceman) was doing something. the little booklet that comes with it is really helpful because i could hardly understand what they said when i watched it on HBO, now i say things like \\"i got your six\\" and \\"we're oscar mike\\" daily.
B001F7MSFM|4.0|The frenetic and kinetic sequel to [[ASIN:B001AK3S4Y Hellboy]] is a madly imaginative romp that has even more zip than the first. Benicio Del Torro increases the depths to each character, given them emotional play around the story and keeps the ideas running. Del Torro brings his gift for visual flair into the movie ala his [[ASIN:B000O76ZQC Pan's Labyrinth]].<br /><br />The other point in \\"Hellboy 2's\\" favor is that Hellboy begins to feel the conflict between the world of humans and of his own kind. The conflict with the elvin world presents Liz with a piece of knowledge that she must keep secret. And Abe falls in love.<br /><br />It's the love factors that make this most interesting and provide the balance of humor. The scene with a beer-lubed Red and Blue singing along to [[ASIN:B00005USBH Barry Manilow]] \\"Can't Smile Without You\\" is a classic. Moments like that are what helps keep \\"Hellboy 2\\" flying high, and make it a better film than the original.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Like most people who enjoy good New Age music, I have heard of Enya before and have listened to her ethereal melodies since her hit \\"Sail away (Orinoco flow)\\".  This, however, is the first CD I've purchased from her and it will most definitely not be the last.  Along with \\"And Winter came...\\", I purchased two other holiday music CD's - those of Sarah Brightman (\\"A Winter Symphony\\") and Loreena McKennitt (\\"A midwinter's night dream\\"), and I must say Enya's is my favorite one.  Perhaps because she has been able to pull out of her creativity for the special holiday season while being true to her style, the CD impresses even more.  Even if one is not a musician, one can still perceive the technique behind this work.<br /><br />\\"And Winter came...\\" introduces this musical experience with a piece without lyrics, just tranquil \\"white\\" music.  Songs that I find outstanding are the self-created \\"White is in the winter night\\", an up-tempo song that simply invites singing along its tune.  \\"Trains and winter rains\\" reminds me of the dark, gloomy days of London in winter.  One excellent piece I have found in the march-along \\"One toy soldier\\", a song that tells the tale of a sad toy until it finally finds happiness with the child that it is given to.  Another great melody, almost inspired by the music of the Beatles (who are mentioned in the lyrics), is \\"My! My! Time flies!\\", a small history of the world in three minutes or less.  The album closes with a chorale version of \\"Silent Night\\" as \\"Oiche Chiuin\\".<br /><br />As her website, and that of Nick and Roma Ryan, indicates, Enya's unique gift for music has also been accompanied by arduous study and unique awards.  This is not surprising, as she has managed to create a sound within the New Age category that is unparalleled.  Her voice and her melodies \\"float\\", as if suspended in mid-air, delight us while they last, and leave us with an innocent memory.  The white horse and the exquisite white dress in the cover of the album, as well as the rest of the photography by Simon Fowler complete the beautiful holiday project, one I will keep listening to for years to come.  After all, it \\"could be 2010\\" very soon.of the photography by Simon Fowler complete the beautiful holiday project, one I will keep listening to for years to come.

1416562605|2.0|My credentials in reviewing this book are that I grew up in middle class India. The graphic narrative by Balram aka the White Tiger is poignant and provocative and makes it a very lively read. The reason the book is 'unputdownable' is because of the unexpected twists in Balram's life and his unpredictable, almost eccentric behavior. In spite of finishing this book in record time, I was left with a bad after-taste because of the overdose of squalor and scandals that surround the protagonist. It is hard to label this book as a 'pleasant escape'. It in fact takes you on a journey, gripping you by the lapels, to a world that is painted in blood and debauchery.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I was impressed with such packaging that housed the cds that are all   personalized in their own personal case. I was just not ready to see such care in organizing these cds.   The case alone is a treasure but then when you open it and find how the seven  folders are colorfully displayed and all numbered carefully.  The layout information booklets are truly worth mentioning and add an exceptional value to any collection.  There is just too much included to list here. It was a great surprise since I was only expecting the CDs.  I find I have to limit my time watching the cds as they are very hard to pull away from.  These series are very busy and tend to keep you totally involved. The settings of the town where it all happens captures you in the way the town carries on traditions and tends to maintain a family lifestyle by joining in on all the holiday get togethers. Lends itself to a friendly safe utopia that steals your heart and mind into the middle of it.   Make sure you have the time to watch this before you get started as it is very difficult to stop watching. I just love these cds and just as much fun watching them over and over. I cannot immagine anyone not falling in love with the Gilmore Girls.

Lo and behold the vast difference of the two. Dark Knight has superb picture quality but Resident Evil is Grainy.. Stick to the DVD is my recomendation...
0060578793|5.0|I have always loved camping in the wilderness, and am always perfecting my skills at it. This book is full of information, and some even I never knew. This I would have to say is by far the best book I have ever seen. If anyone is thinking about bettering there skills in the outdoors this is a very good book. If anyone is an outdoors fan as I am, this would be a very BIG plus to have. If you like camping, hiking, hunting, or fishing without using all the high tech gadgets of today, or as a very good backup plan to these high tech gadgets, this is the book to have.
B0000B1OFL|4.0|This was a pretty good movie. So much so that I will buy it again in Blue Ray. Just seeing Charlize, with Mark Walburg, Norton and Sutherland in one movie should say it all but also having Jason Statham was a great bonus. Very good story plot and surprise ending was great.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|Although the beginning is a bit slow the whole movie is a masterpiece, fans of the genre and/or the director will be delighted with this movie. In my opinion the best of Grindhouse
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|This is a good movie, but not great. The ending does not do justice to the real spirit of what batman was about. So of the psychological babble could have been cut out too. I like to feel good at the end of a movie and if not there should be some good metephysical reason why not. This did not do this. The Blue ray was very good on the graphic, sound and detail.
0740748475|4.0|I figure, if your looking at this product your either intent on buying it or your just drooling because you dont have the cash. so, this review isn't really necessary. Nevertheless you might like to know that i am ecstatic over this collection. I've loved Bill Waterson's cartoons since i first got a hold of my older brother's copy of \\"its a magical world\\". So i thought it was only right to pass on the wisdom of Calvin&Hobbes to MY younger brother this past Christmas. its so awesome to finally have all the reality/fantasy of C&H in one compialation that will, hopefully, last a long time, (that is if Sam doesn't spill Coke on it).
B000P5FH3K|4.0|This is another of Grisham's great books which translates to a very good movie. It will seem like a b-grade movie at times because of the locations and scenes, but the moral and ethical plot will keep you rivited and wondering what will happen next. One of Damon's best works when he is just a youngster. A modern David and Goliath story with a happy ending
031606792X|5.0|I loved this book. It ties up the saa nicely, and has a happy ending...which I love
B001GKJ2FC|3.0|This is a good movie which has some very unique special effects. Most were done in moscow so they are pretty far out there. The idea of bending a bullets flight and seeing two bullets hitting each other is not that believable, but seeing Angelina and Morgan freeman again was worth the price of the DVD. Story line was some what believable.

B0013NAP2G|4.0|As a big fan of Mariah Carey, I was more than happy to pick up her DVD. I've seen her on her last three tours in Toronto, so I knew what to expect from the concert portion of this DVD. Here are the cons and pros of this DVD-set:    Cons:  - I don't like how it is mixed. Her vocals are too high in the mix, while the music is too low. You can really notice the wear and tear in her voice more-so this way.  - Her dance moves are less than stellar (although I do appreciate the effort)  - Her outfits are atrocious. I actually think she looks good in this concert (body-wise), but she needs to cover up a bit and let her talent be the forefront because the wardrobe looks tacky.    Pros:  - Her set-list from her last three tours hasn't changed drastically, so anyone who was disappointed for the \\"Rainbow\\" and \\"Charmbracelet\\" tours not being commercially available, you need not worry anymore.  - She performs the majority of her hits, and she doesn't really miss anything that significant (except her biggest international hit, \\"Without You\\"), so it's a really good retrospective of her career.  She also sings the more popular Bad Boy remixes of \\"Fantasy\\" and \\"Honey (which has a portion of the 'So So Def Remix' with JD), and ends \\"My All\\" with the David Morales Remix.  - Although her voice has been deteriorating over the years, it doesn't sound horrible and she puts in great effort to making a good vocal performance. I know some parts are pre-recorded and I'm sure there is some dubbing going on for this DVD, but most of it is live.  - Her duet with special guests Boyz II Men is a show stopping performance. It was a very emotional moment.  - The bonus features are very entertaining. Especially the documentary which takes you behind the scenes on the tour and where Mariah discusses why she chose the songs that she did etc.    Overall. the cons greatly outweigh the cons. I do not think Mariah is the horrible performer that people make her out to be. She can sing, she has a true connection with her fans (whom she appreciates) when she performs, she sings all the mega-hits and the whole spectacle looks great. If you're not a big Mariah fan, you probably will not thoroughly enjoy this, but if you're a true fan, you will be delighted with this DVD. I recommend it.
B000VNMMPM|5.0|This is an \\"art film\\" for mature audiences who don't mind reading subtitles or who understand French. Visually stunning, well acted and photographed. I won't tell you anything about the plot or characters.    Shot in B&W and done well.    It's funny and sad and uplifting. I recommend it to film lovers, not movie goers.
B001ED7C58|5.0|We purchased the soundtrack for our daughter, who is a big Twilight fan.  She loves the books and movie as well.  She was absolutely thrilled, and listens to the soundtrack non-stop.  Most likely, she already has all the songs memorized.

B001GKJ2FC|5.0|Okay with modern technology comes Hollywoods ability to make things grosser, and more realistic.  This movie has no shortage of f bombs and other extremely violent and bloody scenes.  With that said, . . I LOVED this movie.  Action packed, edge of your seat, nail bitter.  James was very convincing as the average Joe stuck in meaningless life.  Angelina was very convincing assasin, Morgan, . . I mean heck its Morgan Freeman.  Well, casted, beautifuly filmed, nice storyline.  Very entertaining.  As a mom though, . . .VEWIER DISCRESSION ADVISED!!!  Not for the young!!
0156030209|5.0|If I could find a couple words to describe this novel, they would be the words \\"philosophical\\", \\"deep\\", or \\"exciting\\".  The main reason for this is the point of view.  Pi, the main character, is a practicing Hindu, Christian, AND Muslim ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  So when faced with a life or death situation (floating in the middle of the Pacific on a lifeboat with a tiger), it causes Pi to fall into an extremely philosophical mindset.  This causes the book to sort of reach down into the human mind at peril, and it is VERY interesting to read.<br />Also, this book is extremely unpredictable.  Just when you think everything's going to be okay, things take a sudden, explosive turn for the worse.  When you think Pi's life is at its end, a miracle occurs.  The one that most sticks out in my mind is when Pi finds an island, just to find out that is eats people at night.  Now, just in case you didn't read clearly enough last sentence.  THE WHOLE ISLAND IS CARNIVOROUS.  That's what I call bad luck.  But it keeps the story going, and will keep you hooked all the way through.<br />And last but not least, this is one of the few books that actually puts pictures in my head.  I can just  imagine myself looking at the endless ocean from my little boat,keeping an eye on Richard Parker (the tiger)to make sure he didn't pass his side of the lifeboat.<br />To sum it all up, this is an extremely addictive and exciting book, and you will finish it with a different outlook on life.

1439102813|4.0|Bittersweet and poignant, author Lisa Genova hits just the right tone in this story of one woman's adjustment to, and descent into, dementia.  The protagonist, Alice, is a bright, articulate, successful academic.  She starts forgetting things, getting confused, losing words.  The author moves us through these changes slowly, but never ploddingly.  With this dark subject, the author has a daunting task.  What happens to Alice and her family is sad, but the author does a brilliant job in handling Alice's internal feelings.      I was very interested in this subject, having recently lost my mother to Parkinson's.  It is a sad book, but I loved it.  By the end, as a reader, I understood that Alice kept her essential self until the end of the book, and saw that she was \\"still Alice.\\"

0060595183|5.0|you don't need to take psychedelics to realize their importance in this world, especially when you have this book to tell the story from the mind of an intelligent writer...    aldous, like all psychedelic virigns, went into the experience of taking a psychedelic with his own ideas of what it would bring...in some ways he was right, in other ways he could never have predicted such wonderful things...    doors of perception is basically a campfire story about a man's journey on mescaline (found in peyote) translated into basic english...he does a fine job of explaining the unexplainable and keeps you interested all throughout the book....my favorite part is  how he describes being under the influence as the loss of survival mode....this is spot on and it is the same idea as ego death....there are plants on this earth that can kill you ego for a few hours so you can finally see the world from untainted eyes....finally a chair is just a chair...a tree is just a tree....the ground connects to your feet and to the tree and to the air and back again (reminds me of i am the walrus \\"i am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together\\")    if you are not going to take a psychedelic you could at least read this book!
B001EOQWFI|4.0|This story line was well written and carried throughout the viewing. The problem is that the film itself was just too short. Wall-E was a great character and brought meaning to the film. The storyline could have used a boost but overall it played out fairly well. In my opinion the 'human' characters could have been left out and the entire story written around Wall-E and his friend.

031606792X|2.0|Lots of spoilers here...<br /><br />This was just as bad as the second book in my opinion. It wasn't that it didn't have enough going on. It was that everything seemed so disjointed; characters falling completely...out of character. It all started out smoothly. But then it all went downhill so fast. You start out thinking \\"finally, we can get this vampire change thing out of the way & get on with things\\", but no. Honeymoon...great! Everything seems happy. Then it comes to sex again & moods get ruined, and suddenly you've got bartering on Bella's end to get the sex she wants, and Edward naming more conditions. Then it comes down to Bella postponing the \\"change\\" just to get some sex. And that leaves you wondering if she's never going to become a vampire, which was what the whole series was about...she didn't fit in as a human, is more comfortable with the vampires, and desperately wants to be one.<br /><br />And then, out of nowhere, the author throws in another curve ball. Congrats! You're pregnant! Enjoy! Not only that, but suddenly Bella wants to be a mom. What happened to not wanting marriage? Not wanting to be a mom? So then you've got a very accelerated gestation period. Bella's hanging on by a thread. No one can talk sense into her, so she keeps wasting away during pregnancy. Then you've suddenly got Jake back in the picture as Edward basically tells him he can have a kid with Bella. Another curve ball! After we've beat up on him so much, now he gets dragged back in again.<br /><br />Now she's so wrapped up in her \\"baby\\" that she doesn't care if she dies (which would result in Edward kiling himself), she doesn't care that it hurts both Edward & Jake to see her like that, and she doesn't care that her family & friends are left blowing in the wind. All the things she used to obsess over...she suddenly no longer cares about? The second she finds out she's pregnant she suddenly doesn't even care that previously she didn't want to be a mother? All logic just went right out the window. It's different when you want to be a mom, or have been pregnant long enough to come to terms with the fact that you didn't want this, but it happened, and you're okay with it (and grow into the \\"i'll die if I have to\\" mindset). But she gives birth, if you can call it that, and then becomes a vampire.<br /><br />They also build up the Jake/Leah thing. I was growing into the idea of those two being together...orphan-type situation and whatnot. But then Jake imprints on the baby, and so Leah is left hanging out to dry. By the end of the book everyone is happy (or has a chance for happiness) but Leah. Way to go! But lets get back to Jake. He no longer obsesses over Bella. But now Edward is angry over the imprint. This comes after he understood the process, that it wasn't controllable, and after Jake having been told that someday he would imprint & be happy.<br /><br />So at that point I think, \\"okay, now we can get on with her new life\\". Apparently not. I'm thinking that we'll get to see how she handles the newborn process, but she ends up skipping it. First vamp in history to do so. So then I figure that at the very least the rest of the book will be about her discovering her abilities, learning to use them, and the Jake/Nessie relationship (what with her accelerated growth). But all of that drags out with a whole lot of nothing until the very end of the book. I mean, even out beloved Alice flat out flees the scene. Sure she returns later, but when she left there was absolutely no hope of her return (not even a hint to Bella that she left to help, not just flee). So when she did actually return I wasn't suprised or excited, I was annoyed, regardless of the fact that her return had relevance. This book was a terrible ending to the saga. I can only hope that she continues the story in some form in the future, reads some critiques, and developes a truly enjoyable book, the whole way through.different when you want to be a mom, or have been pregnant long enough to come to terms with the fact that you didn't want this, but it happened, and you're okay with it (and grow into the \\"i'll die if I have to\\" mindset).

B000V8I2QU|3.0|this is the BEST album of 1987!    Way to age gracefully, Bruce.
B00005JKBC|5.0|This is a great thriller and keeps you engaged in nonstop excitement. Robert Redford at his best.
B000001FQI|5.0|From the first thirty seconds of this rich, organic, aural feast, it is evident that Roland Orzabal and Curt Smith have taken huge steps forward musically.  Gone are the pulsating synths, replaced by live classic instrumentation.  Gone is the angst ridden electro-gothic sound of their early work, replaced by huge, jazzy, soulful, slightly psychedelic melodies.  The spare, haunting instrumentation gives Orzabal's evocative tenor room to breathe, and breathe he does, with a resonance and range only hinted at on their first two records.  A then unknown Oleta Adams (best known for her memorable cover of \\"Get Here\\"), lends her unforgettably husky voice to the first two tracks, perfectly complementing Orzabal's.     The cover and title song are obvious Beatles homages, but nothing else on this record sounds remotely like Lennon-McCartney.  While these salutes  invite comparison, that's where it ends in my book.  Orzabal and Smith are coming from somewhere else musically: equal parts arena rock, philly soul, jazz melancholia, and artful, restrained piano balladry.  One doesn't have to listen hard to detect in early form the tasteful guitar driven britpop template most popularized by Coldplay.    As good and occasionally great as \\"The Hurting\\" and \\"Songs from the Big Chair\\" are, this one eclipses them both, because it is timeless.  It has aged exceedingly well, unlike most of the hair metal so popular at that time.  \\"The Seeds of Love\\" sounds as if it could have been released forty years ago.  Or for that matter, four months ago.    It's hard not to wax nostalgic about this record, so I'll just indulge myself.  Uplifting yet mournful, life-affirming yet heartbreaking, this record more than any other soundtracks my coming of age with all its contradictions, tensions, and emotional dissonance.  It captures equally the ecstasy and alienation of my late-teen rites of passage.  To this day, its layers of melody instantly evoke the relationships so important to me then- the onesthat made that alienation bearable.    Highlights? Where to begin: the sunny, texured shuffle and gorgeous harmonies of \\"Woman in Chains\\", the nostalgic, Philly-soul tinged idealism of \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\" (my own personal Senior class song), the darkly layered, minor key driven dirge \\"Swords and Knives\\", or the heartbreaking closer, the cathartic, apocalyptic love song \\"Famous Last Words\\", featuring the line, \\"Hand in hand, we'll do and die, listening to the band that made us cry...\\"  Indeed.  Thank you, Tears for Fears.
B001F290E4|4.0|Listening to the classic songs such as \\"A change is gonna come\\" and \\"I can't stand the rain\\" sung by Seal is such an amazing experience. I think in the back of our minds we have always wondered what he would sound like performing some of these songs and now we have it! Would have been nice for him to throw in one or two new originals. All in all a great CD to curl up with your favorite loved one and enjoy each other's company ; - )
B00127RAJY|5.0|I am an exercise DVD and equipment junkie. Treadmill, Bowflex, Fluidity Bar, Tae Bo, Power 90, Zumba, pilates...you name it, I've got it. I have many good workout DVDs, but usually do not have forty minutes to an hour to block out to work out everyday. Jillian has done a very good job of packing a challenging workout into 20 minutes. The movements are simple, yet executed very effectively. I can get up at a decent hour (6 AM), do this workout and still get my kids to school (and myself to work) on time. It's great, because I am motivated to get up and do it since I know I can get it done and get on with my day. I definitely feel the burn.     One reviewer complained that they did not feel enough burn on the upper body strength and ab exercises. If you need more of an upper body challenge, you may try increasing your weight. To intensify the ab workouts, one might do them on an exercise ball or add weight during this portion. I use my rebounder for some of the cardio portion which enhances the movement and reduces impact.    As for those who have said it is boring, I don't find it boring at all. But then, I want an effective workout--not to be entertained. I have a few boring workout videos--this is not one of them. I guess it's a matter of personal taste. I'm glad to have it in my exercise library.

B001DWNUCO|4.0|It's hard to view this film divorced from its controversy.  To see spliced-in pornographic acts performed in a film so sumptuously photographed blurs our aesthetics; or it did mine, anyway.  Whatever the final opinion, it was definitely never boring.  Along with the nearly constant atrocities stemming from a complete abuse and debasement of power, it has stunning visuals going for it.  Therefore a revitalized hi-def transfer makes an excellent opportunity to see it afresh.  After watching [[ASIN:B001DWNUCO Caligula [Blu-ray]]] (\\"The Imperial Edition\\"), and delving into all the extras, I've concluded that, despite its many flaws, it is indeed a good film.  By all accounts, it could have been a GREAT film, but as often is the case with ambitious visions, conflicts led to too many compromises, eventuating to no one's satisfaction.  There will never be a critical consensus on it, but still, anyone interested in films has to conclude it has its merits.  This edition makes that obvious.<br /><br />To sum it up, Malcolm McDowell plays Caligula as mirthfully cruel, irreverent, and giddily insane.  John Gielgud, making an early departure, plays with erect Shakespearean dignity Tiberius' only friend, the wise Nerva, contemptuous of the inevitable scenario of Rome's further decline at Caligula's ascendancy.  Peter O'Toole portrays Tiberius as demoralized and sardonically embittered by the trappings of power, his face scabby and scalp clumpy from the ravages of syphilis.  Once Tiberius dies -- all of the actors with major theater credentials exit relatively early -- Caligula has the playground of Rome all to himself.<br /><br />Having never seen the remastered SD special edition released a couple of years ago, I'm unable to compare its image quality to the transfer on [[ASIN:B001DWNUCO Caligula [Blu-ray]]].  But I can state with certainty that this Blu-ray edition is far superior to the initial DVD issued back in the 1990s.  Art director and costume designer Danilo Donati gave cinematographer Silvano Ippoliti a lively palette and grand designs to work with, and it's illuminated here.  While the age of the print is apparent at times, the hi-def transfer revives the lost vibrancy of the draped luxury and pillared architecture.  And aside from the brighter picture, there's a cornucopia tucked away in the special features.<br /><br />The extras include two versions of \\"The Making of Caligula\\"; interviews (about 30 minutes each) with director Tinto Brass, actor John Steiner (who portrayed Longinus), and Penthouse pet Lori Wagner (who, in hindsight, realizes she was in way over her head, thanks to her blind ambition); three audio commentaries (McDowell, Helen Mirren, and on-set writer Ernest Volkman); an alternate pre-release version of the film; and, rounding out the set, the usual odds and ends (deleted scenes, theatrical trailers, and so on).  This two-disc edition comes with a 15-page booklet detailing the film's troubled production, in which the essayist R. J. Buffalo concludes passionately that a full restoration to its original vision is in order.  It's a hell-freezes-over probability.  From the artifacts among the bonus features, it's obvious that two immutable creative forces were in direct conflict.  Gore Vidal, who wrote the original screenplay, eventually disavowed the film when director Brass altered how Caligula himself was presented.  It must have come down to an interpretation of the script, because Vidal's earlier version is included as a DVD-ROM extra, and a lot of the dialogue was retained, some of it word for word.  So, on the one hand, you have Brass wanting a sexually explicit, anarchistic romp; on the other you have Vidal's depiction of Caligula as derisive of the ruling class, and abuses power as mockery.  The result is a schizophrenic montage.  In my judgment, Vidal's vision edges out ahead slightly, as by the time you get to all that explicit sex, they're not festivities you'd want to be invited to.  So the question remains, to whose vision would the final edit be restored?<br />________________________________________se vision would the final edit be restored?      ________________________________________

This ties the two together perfectly, explaining how my two worlds, who for some reason oppose eachother greatly, actually blend so beautifully.<br /><br />I think every med student, every biology student, and every PERSON should read this book, read it with an open mind, read it and try it, don't naysay.<br /><br />There was once a time where the world thought that the world was flat.  Where people who said it wasn't where laughed at, ridiculed.  There was a time when doctors drilled holes in schizophrenics heads to let the demons out, and cut their feet open to let the evil out when they had the flu, and that was not questioned at all.  The world has a history of constantly believing that we know everything.  We know what it all means, and we are CERTAIN!  but almost without fail, with study, and people working against that majority, as they are ridiculed, the majority is proven wrong.<br /><br />I'm saying read it knowing that we dont know everything.  Read it and understand.<br />Esspecially if you have a background in biology, this will prove a tremendous help and explain a lot of things that may have confused you in the past, if your anything like me, someone who questions everything they learn constantly ;)<br /><br />enjoy, its really a great read.

031606792X|5.0|I've been absolutely enraptured with their stories from my first look into Bella Swan and the Cullen family in Twilight.  This is a saga that you can lose yourself in and really care about the outcomes for the individual characters.  My concern for parents is that this book may not be as appropriate for young girls as the other books were.
0393039765|1.0|I find it inexplicable that some of my smartest friends love this book.    I only read the first 30 pages of this book.  However, this does not make me ineligible for a review.  This is one of very few books that I have found so unentertaining and devoid of literary merit that I chose not to finish it.  Sitting in place and staring at a wall is a better use of my time; at least that does not want to make me throw up.    This book tries to be dark, but what made me put it down is how obviously and self-consciously it tries to be cool.  Some writers are skilled enough to write stylistically, but Chuck Palahniuk is not one of these.  Palahniuk substitutes irrelevant flourishes and sentences for style.    Also, the characters are immensely unlikeable.  Despite any intentions to reveal truths about humanity, the characters are inhuman.  They show no vulnerability, possess none of the weaknesses with which we all have to deal.  Any problems they may have are too obviously intended to seem cool  and countercultural.    Man, it really blows my mind how bad this book is.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I have always DISLIKED ABBA - however, against my better judgement, I saw the stageshow in London soon after it was presented and liked it very much (all except the mob dance at the end).  I have been looking forward to seeing the film, especially with Meryl Streep on board.  The cast is great BUT what a miserable disaster this movie is.  The mistake is that the director has filmed a STAGESHOW.  The movie is exhausting!  Everyone RUNS and no one seems to walk.  The production numbers blend into one.  The facial expressions are all overdone.  In other words, a stageshow has been filmed.  A total disappointment.  I was also NOT IMPRESSED with the actors - Julie Walters looked terrible, the men were hopeless and had no singing voices and even Meryl Streep was not at her best.  The three women were also disappointing.  A total flop for me .......... but I am sure that I am in the minority here just as I was when ABBA first burst on the scene back in the 70's.  Makes you remember just how good the Beatles really were!

B001HN6972|5.0|This is an exquisitely \\"well put together\\" movie, containing several themes riding along the outer edge of some of the most sensitive of modern moral dilemmas -- all \\"played out\\" to perfection by a giant of an actor, Kate Winslet: a torrid illicit sexual affair between a mid-30ish illiterate German woman and a fifteen-year old schoolboy; the struggle to deal with the shame of being illiterate in a modern society; broken lives caused by the psychological consequences and damage of the affair; a post-war Germany still trying to come to grips with the moral stain of the Nazi era -- all overlaid atop a subtext of guilt, shame and a hope for absolution and ultimately redemption by Germany over the European holocaust.<br /><br />Kate Winslet, in the performance of a lifetime, literally disappears into the role of Hanna Schmidt, an illiterate, female ex-guard of Auschwitz, who over the course of one summer seduces a schoolboy to have sex with, and read to her. This turned into a torrid four-week sexual tryst after which she then abruptly disappears from his life -- until, that is, they meet again in a Berlin courtroom. He, as a heartbroken and psychologically damaged law student (in the courtroom along with his class to observe the trial proceedings); and she, as a co-defendant against charges for atrocities committed as a concentration camp guard.<br /><br />The tension reaches a crescendo in the courtroom as she, along with four other female guards, throw cross-accusations at each other over who was the true author of a report absolving them of any responsibility for having locked into, and then sent to their deaths, 300 women and children in a burning church. While her cohorts got off with light sentences, Hanna was sentenced to life - primarily for having confessed to writing the report -- even though unbeknownst to the court, she could neither read nor write. Rather than reveal this embarrassing bit of exculpatory information to the court -- and expose to the world that she was not only a murderer and moral ingrate, but also an illiterate one -- she chose to admit to being the author of the report.<br /><br />Already knowing the truth about her, this was one of two opportunities for her \\"young lawyer to be ex-lover\\" to come to her rescue.  Each time he dallied reluctantly, and then declined to exercise this option. Had he exposed the truth about her illiteracy, she of course would have been saved from a life sentence. And if that had happened, the movie itself would then have resolved itself into a facile \\"American style melodrama.\\" But he elected not to do so -- both in that instance and again, at the end of her sentence twenty years later when she was paroled. During the course of her sentence he had stayed in touch with her and as a result, she had learned to read and write through a series of audio tapes Berg had mailed to her. As she was about to be released, Berg, her only known acquaintance was again called upon to rescue her, but again he declined by failing to befriend her in the way she wished: that is, emotionally. This final rejection, of course led inexorably to her suicide (by standing on a stack of books, no less).<br /><br />Altogether, this was an eminently believable story that was resolved in a way that did not reduce it, or its characters, into a cheap melodrama, but one that, for the most part, left all of the difficult feelings and moral themes unresolved: just as in \\"real life.\\" But it did so with the dignity and respect of all of the morally beleaguered parties all unchanged, even if not completely intact.<br /><br />The final denouement was the penultimate scene in which the ex-boyhood/lover, now lawyer, Michael Berg, presented the daughter of the sole survivor of the \\"church burning,\\" with all the worldly possessions of Hanna Schmidt, which totaled slightly more than 7,000 Deutschmarks. She refused the offering recognizing it for what it was: as an attempt to purchase \\"on the cheap,\\" her (and all Jews)absolution and redemption.<br /><br />In a speech that (at least for me) was the highlight of the movie, she told him: \\"You should seek literature and the theater if you are looking for catharsis, not the concentration camps: Nothing comes out of the camps ... nothing.<br /><br />What a movie! As a result of this performance, Kate Winslet has \\"a lock\\" on \\"the Best Actress of the year award.\\" Five stars.

Michelle Yeoh is a good actor but she had nothing to work on.     The money this film made at the box office accurately reflects how bad it is.

As for me, especially when it's cold, I dread to be this family who goes in the water, through the snow storm and be chased by a bear. I sometimes end the story with, \\"aren't you glad we are in a safe and comfort of home?\\"

B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Michael Moore did a brillant job exposing the plethora fallacies within the American health care system. As I watched this movie, I was reminded of the movie starring Denzel Washington, \\"John Q\\" whereby Denzel's character decides to take matters into his own hands, in an effort to save his only son's life. Basically, he holds a local hospital hostage at gunpoint to perform the necessary surgery to save his son's life. [[ASIN:B00005JKWX John Q. (Infinifilm Edition)]]Now, by no means am I suggesting that Denzel's character was right....but I fully understand his pain, personally.<br /><br />Hopefully, under the Obama administration, positive change will come to America's health care system that will help the thousands of American's with and/or without health insurance.
B0017ANAZO|2.0|As movies go, it was not terrible.  It had great comedic moments, like Annette Benning's initial conversation with the gossippy manicurist.  However, why didn't they just hire Kim Cattrall to play that role?  It was essentially the same character as SATC's Samantha.  In fact, Kristin Davis would have played the Debra Messing character perfectly, and Sarah Jessica Parker even has the same wild hair Meg Ryan's character had.  Candice Bergen was already in SATC so her placement in The Women was a short reach. I also must add that Jada Pinkett Smith is too talented and beautiful to be relegated to the token black/ lesbian sidekick.  And quite frankly, Annette Benning's snippy comment to the woman with the dog at the beginning of the movie-about how she was wearing last years shoes- made me smirk.  Lady, (and yes, I know she was a fictional character) most of the world can't afford shoes and the rest of us shop at Payless.  Yet, I will probably continue to watch movies about spoiled rich ladies and continue to be glad I'm not friends with them.  What a hypocrite am I :)
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I love this CD.  I listen to it over and over again. What a voice!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I bought this DVD to replace a much-used VHS that we bought in 1991. I really enjoy the \\"extras\\" which included commentary from several of the actors in the movie. They give interesting background information about the shooting of many of the scenes. Randy Quaid reveals the real life person he patterned his character \\"Cousin Eddy,\\" as well as an interesting tidbit about being related to Gene Autry.
0788815490|5.0|Beautifully shot, with gorgeous costumes, this Henry James adaptation is stunning. Forget the beauty of the film for a second; this is a fantastic example of human nature and what we are capable of.    I'm surprised that the book is not more popular given the nuances of the story. There are no straight lines here and the director, along with the characters and actors, give the impression, as they should, that the action is happening on the spot.     If you liked THE GOLDEN BOWL or some of Wharton's adptations, this one will fall into the same category. What is most amazing abou this movie is its subtlty and yet raw portrait of love, meaness, and all that goes along with being human.
B000OPPBEQ|4.0|I was very disappointed in the quality of the first film, because I really didn't see any difference in quality from the DVD version. However the other films in the set do benefit greatly from the increased resolution. They are stunning. The first film -- not so much.
B0000542D2|5.0|I bought this Beatles DVD set for my father for Christmas. He has called me twice telling me how much he enjoys this set. I would highly recommend it to any Beatles fan!
0425188809|5.0|I have read every single one of Koontz' novels and still love this one the best. To date, I've read Watchers at least a dozen times, and although I know exactly what will happen, still cry at the heart-rending parts and laugh at the comedic relief woven throughout. Koontz is my favorite author and I love his work, but Watchers is so awesome there are  not words. The dog ... oh, do I love the dog.
B000641MB6|5.0|Very pleased with the quality of the video.  Preferred this B/W version.  It also arrived quickly.
B001DPHDCY|1.0|I have yet to receive this movie and I ordered it quite some time ago.  I did however get my cd's but not my son's movie for christmas.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|While my two-year old great nephew was derailing a runaway Lionel train around the Christmas tree and had totally wrecked a ranch-style plastic home, my other great nephews and great niece were exhorting me to open the presents they brought me. Knowing I had seen the play on Broadway three times and once in Toronto, it was no surprise that \\"Momma Mia,\\" the DVD was behind the decorative Christmas paper. \\"Oh, can we watch it, Uncle Ed?\\" (If ever a gift could keep on giving right back to the givers)!<br /><br />Even though Meryl Streep is old enough to be a grandmother (and probably is), the camera never gets too close to her face, as she plays a barely middle-aged mother of a love-struck daughter on the verge of marriage. The daughter discovers that Mom was a bit wilder in her youth having made love to three men at approximately the same time. The plot unfolds when she decides to invite her \\"fathers\\" to the wedding without her mother's knowledge. MOMMA MIA!<br /><br />This is loosely based on a late 60's movie titled \\"Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell,\\" where the twist is that Gina Lollabrigitta tells three American World War II veterans that they are the father of her son. Their guilt and money provide for the same. Only here, the setting is an unnamed Greek isle instead of Italy, and mom is barely scraping by running what can be charitably called an inn.<br /><br />An unabashed ABBA fan, I enjoy each hit over and over again, and could play them all day. I play them when I am in a good mood, and when I need to get in a good mood. The music from this can be found on the CD for the movie (d'uh), or ABBA Gold, which has every one but, \\"I do.\\"<br /><br />So, love me or leave me, but please don't deceive me, because I won't deceive you. Meryl Streep reveals her absolute depth in her performance. Her ending with her co-stars is a triumph of harmony on stage or at Waterloo where Napoleon did surrender. Pierce Brosnan's bellowing efforts might make you want to suck on a lemon while someone is running steel fingernails across a blackboard, but the movie is fun even in a rich man's world, or for a super trouper. The supporting cast was superb. I was particularly impressed with Julie Walters who played one of Meryl Streep's adult sidekicks. Christine Baranski was predictably good. I never imagined that Stellan Skaarsgard could kick up a storm the way he did.<br /><br />My gift included a trailer that allowed the viewer to see the making of the movie, and the songs being replayed in the movie with the words appearing, but without the bouncing ball. It helped me learn a lot of the correct words that men seem to have a harder time identifying them than women do when it comes to song. (Up to age 50, I thought Popeye was strong to the \\"pinach\\" cuz I eats me spinach).<br /><br />Do I recommend this DVD? I ask in all honesty, without a song or dance what are we? So I say thank you for the music, (and the DVD,) for giving it to me. Just remember there is no comparison between this and what you would see on Broadway, in Toronto or Peoria at Route 24, Junction 8, for that matter. The movie could only leave you disappointed. It is entertaining especially if you are forgiving of Streep and Brosnan not being singers.<br /><br />Thank you, Christian, Gabriella, Samuel Adam, and Emmanuel.<br /><br />Uncle Ed<br /><br />For Barrie Bracken.nails across a blackboard, but the movie is fun even in a rich man's world, or for a super trouper.

B000006IUQ|5.0|This movie  is the most under-rated films of all time. Briefly:    Pros:  1.) Beautiful photography and locations.  2.) Decent theme background music.  3.) Great character sketches and developments    Cons:    Can't think of any right now.    All in all, I bought it (not as a DVD) but as video on demand thingie(just easier that way for me), But I'd buy a Blu Ray disc if there's one available simply because of its video-photography which makes it amazingly gorgeous.    Regards  Vyas, Anirudh
B00005S6K6|5.0|I know Bobby's done a lot of great work...but wouldn't you like to see the softer side??? Well, this will reveal it along with yet another notable performance by Streep.  Give yourself a treat and get this.
031606792X|5.0|I loved all of the books, and the characters. I see nothing wrong in creating another immortal love story. Its like a new Tarzan and Jane, Superman and Lois Lane, or Radha and Krsna. I for one think these kinds of love stories are the best ones.
B00197YZ7M|5.0|Added this to my collection. This is one of those films that is collaboratively exquisite...acting, directing, cinematogaphy, soundtrack, everything. And no...this won't spoil it if you haven't seen it already.  One of my favorite scenes involves a hand clutching at a door handle...Enjoy!!!
0545128285|5.0|As a huge Potter fan I was very happy to see this book released. It was a quick read but definately worth adding to my collection. Now if we could just get \\"A History of Hogwarts\\".....
B001H5X7I4|1.0|The trailer is misleading featuring good rock music, a quick pace and clean language.  The actual movie is not funny, full of nasty language, and moves at a snail's pace.  It was so offensive I did not notice the music.  Nick Nolte's character is colorful and amusing, but his performance does not carry this awful movie out of the one star zone.
B000EGCITG|5.0|For my husband and me-this album has become one of \\"our\\" albums. I cry whenever I hear \\"Who Knew,\\" because it makes me think of how I'd feel if I lost my husband. I just love the album. That's all.  Oh, yeah. \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is also a great song!
B0007RT9LM|4.0|For the past 9 years I have harbored a secret desire to watch Coyote Ugly. I thought it would be extremely cheesy but that I would like it in spite of it all. A guilty pleasure. I expected to like it, like I enjoyed Flash Dance, Mystic Pizza with the debut of Julia Roberts, Bottoms Up with Paris Hilton and Jason Mewes, or Cocktail with Tom Cruise. I thought I would like it, but I didn't expect that I would like it as much as I did. Now I am wondering why I waited 9 years.<br /><br />Violet Sanford (Piper Pirabo) is a Pizza Waitress in New Jersey, but she dreams of moving to New York to be a Songwriter. Her mother wanted to be a singer, too, but gave it up to marry Violet's dad (John Goodman). He is a toll collector, and he depends on her a lot, now that his wife has passed away. He can't stop her from pursuing her dream, even though he'd prefer that she stayed in Jersey.<br /><br />Once she has moved to New York, she finds that it is tough making a living, and ends up working at a rough bar called Coyote Ugly, where the bartenders, all female, dance on the bar, and keep up a rowdy atmosphere that packs the joint nightly. What kind of drinks do they serve there?<br /><br />----------------------------------<br />Customer: So, basically you have...?<br />Lil: Jim, Jack, Johnny Red, Johnny Black, and Jose; all my favorite men. You can have it any way you like it, as long as it's in a shot glass.<br />==========================================<br /><br />At first Violet/Jersey has a really rough time of it, but Lil, the owner, thinks her fresh innocent look will make up for what she lacks in experience:<br /><br />-------------------------------<br />Lil: Hey, everybody, shut up! I'd like you to meet my new girl, whose name is... Jersey! Jersey, is an ex kindergarten teacher, and a former nun, who just escaped from the convent, and is tired of being the only virgin in New York City! Would anyone like to buy her a drink?<br />===========================================<br /><br />Not surprisingly, quite a few want to have that privilege. After a while she fits right in, but still she wonders why the strange name?<br /><br />---------------------<br />Girl: Can I ask you somethin'?<br />Lil: What?<br />Girl: What - Oh, what does Coyote Ugly mean?<br />Lil: Did you ever wake up sober after a one night stand, and the person you're next to is layin' on your arm, and they're so ugly, you'd rather chew off your arm then risk waking 'em? That's coyote ugly.<br />Girl: My God. But, why would you name your bar after somethin' like that?<br />Lil: Oh, because Cheers was taken.<br />=============================================<br /><br />Meanwhile she is making the rounds with her demo tapes and goes to another bar where the bartender tells her that Mr. O'Donnell (Adam Garcia), who is really a cook, is in charge of booking. He plays along until his boss blows his cover, and then, though he got off on the wrong foot, he keeps trying to win her over. One guess if he ever does. She is also having a hard time overcoming her stage fright, but finds that the only way to get her songs heard is to perform at the open mic. Wonder if she ever gets over that stage fright?<br /><br />Coyote Ugly takes what is a clich&eacute; as a story, but it is done very well. The Coyotes put on quite a show, and the dance numbers and routines in the bar are really the highlight of the film. One of the dancers, Zoë, is played by Tyra Banks, who does her best Naomi Campbell impersonation. Coyote Ugly is always just on the verge of a huge bar room brawl. Piper Pirabo is really great in the lead, like Jennifer Beals in Flashdance, or Julia Roberts in Mystic Pizza. She looks a lot like Carly Simon, with a luscious full set of lips. She is really quite a pretty face, but her acting wasn't too shabby, either. I am surprised that she is not an even bigger star.<br /><br />Adam Garcia, as the grill cook/boyfriend, was more than adequate to the task. He is an Australian witha background in dance, and at first his career seemed to be following in John Travolta's footsteps, with parts in Australian productions of Saturday Night Fever and Grease. Luckily, his character, Kevin O'Donnell, is supposed to be from Australia, too. He has played opposite Lindsay Lohan in Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen and Drew Barrymore in Riding in Cars With Boys. In Ugly, his character went beyond the basic requirements for a cute boyfriend and had a few quirks. He was a comic book collector, and trades his most prized possession, a rare Spider-man comic, for an audition for Violet. Kevin Smith (Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Chasing Amy) actually did some unaccredited work on the script, but surprisingly, though he is an avid comic collector who sold his collection to finance his early films, and then bought them back as soon as he could afford to, he didn't come up with the idea to make O'Donnell a comic collector.<br /><br />Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who surprised writer Gina Wendkos because that is not his usual shtick, Ugly features Johnny Knoxville (Jackass), Ellen Cleghorne (Saturday Night Live), and Bud Cort (Harold & Maude) in cameos.<br /><br />One aspect of Coyote Ugly that I enjoyed was the music, though the music that Violet writes, Piper Pirabo auditioning or performing the songs that she \\"wrote,\\" was nothing to write home about. In spite of her not really knocking me out with her singing talent, I identified with her quest, being a denizen of the open mic scene myself. She somehow managed to turn a diagnosis of the symptoms of Stage Frightus Majorious into a cute seduction scene that I forgave for its silliness for obvious reasons. There was some good music on the soundtrack. There is a song by Joe Strummer and The Mescalaros, a little INXS, some Blondie, Kid Rock, The Georgia Satellites, Reverend Horton Heat, Third Eye Blind, The Stray Cats, Billy Idol, and LeAnn Rimes even shows up as a new Coyote near the end and does a tune. LeAnn is also dubbed in when Piper is singing, but they just didn't have that great of material for her to do. I would much rather hear LeAnn's rhymes on the Patsy Cline style \\"Blue\\" or some hard core Country than to have her waste her pipes on the watered down pop Piper was doing. Still, the soundtrack album did remain in the Billboard Top 40 for more than a year.<br /><br />Coyote Ugly?

159448385X|5.0|This is one of my very favorite books right now. The emotions invoked are raw and rare. The story is very touching and real. The writing is splendid and paints a vivid picture. I had an Afghanistan-born gentleman, who saw me reading it, ask me if I liked it. I responded in the affirmative, and he said, \\"me, too. It's so sad that this book portrays the reality of the lives of so many women in Afghanistan.\\" So, there you go: credibility from a native.
B000068CNX|5.0|Product purchased was as described, very easy transaction and quick delivery. Product in perfect condition. Would recommend this supplier
B000W91RUG|4.0|This DVD set is just great.  It is great comedy that will have you laughing out loud. I can't wait till season 2 comes out.
B001EOQWF8|5.0|I actually enjoy watching this animation. Its imaginative, its fun to watch, and it reminds me of this other robot movie from long ago. There's not much talking in the movie. So if you don't understand English, you don't need to worry.    oh yeah, You have to watch the Bonus Features. There's 2 short animation clips in there and it's so freaking hilarious!
B0000214F0|4.0|Caligula the movie with Malcolm McDowell is not the only film that graphically displays the depravity of Rome but is the most famous.<br />The film is about as accurate as the classic Cleopatra with Liz Taylor.<br />The film is not as depraved as reality in some caes mostly in homosexual terms. EX: Tiberius little fishes were mostly if not 100% young boys in the film they are all women. None of Caligula's homosexual affairs are in the film. Supposedly there were only a few emperors that were not bisexual.<br />The movie is funny at times and overall depicts Caligula better than history did. Newer history has redeemed him a bit and this movie might have spurned it. Great acting , this is not a hack movie.<br />The newest versions of this film contain additional porn so no need for the newest versions this one has all the acting.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|As I approach my 50th birthday, I can honestly say \\"Mad Men\\" is the finest television drama I have had the pleasure to watch.  For those of you who are tired of the horrendous offerings (reality and otherwise) produced by the networks and some cable channels, treat yourself to \\"Mad Men.\\"  The writing is superb and the acting phenomenal.  Jon Hamm has movie star qualities the likes of which we haven't seen for decades -- reminiscent of those 1940's legends we so dearly miss.  I don't typically write many reviews, but in the case of \\"Mad Men,\\" it is my sincere privilege to spread the word.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|This is Jeff Becks live recording of his one week stand at Ronnie Scotts intimate jazz club in London. No matter how many superlatives I could come up,it would not be high enough praise for Jeff and this record. This is the same band Jeff put together for the Crossroads concerts in 2007. The band is very well rehearsed and gives Jeff the freedom to explore all possibilities in his songs. To put it bluntly, what Jeff does with the guitar should not be possible. Jeff Beck is the greatest electric guitarist who has ever lived and this record proves that statement. I can hardly wait for the companion DVD to be released in March 2009.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing it in the theater.I do not like musicals  but when I saw this with 3 of my 5 sisters we had a blast .  We were up dancing in our seats . Our arms and hands never stopped moving .     Go see this or buy it !!!    Pat Keller
B000GFLKF8|5.0|This begins with a chilling statement of intent by the leading man, and from then on it is a marvel of carefully planned and flawlessly executed bank robbery.     The trick is that although there are hang on the edge of your seat moments this gang has seemed to have foreseen and planned for everything. This is a great movie and you will not regret purchasing it. My companion and I watched it twice in two days just to get the most enjoyment out of it. It wears well!
B000N4SHOE|5.0|A beautiful historical tale of creativity, perseverence, living authentically, and a zest for life. Drama, angst, celebration. It invokes a lot of emotion as one identifies with Miss Potter and her struggle to be OK with her out-of-sync outlook in Victorian London. Suitable for family viewing.
0743497465|5.0|Rebekah Ellis<br />Mr. Melia<br />Per.4<br />1/7/09<br />Deception Point Book Review<br />The first thought that comes to my mind when I think about Deception Point is intensity.  This was a really good book.  When up and coming data analysis Rachel Sexton is ordered from the president of the United States to be secretly flown to Antarctica, things get pretty complicated. NASA has made a world-changing discovery and is ready to introduce it to the world when something happens.  Senator Sedgwick Sexton is Rachel's father and is running for president, Sexton thinks NASA is a wasteful spending program but little does he know about the discovery. Rachel doesn't agree with his views and doesn't really like him, but when things get really heated she still has a loyalty to her father.  All seems well and this should be a great event but when things get complicated everyone gets confused.... Read Deception Point by Dan Brown if you want an intense and thrilling read.  I greatly recommend this book to everyone! It was awesome and really suspenseful and thrilling. I would buy this book because it is worth the investment and you won't ever read anything like it.  You never knew what was coming on the next page, and what you think turns out to be wrong.  This has to be one of Dan Browns greatest works.  It is a must read!  Definitely five stars.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|This was a great deal! Just like how it would have been if I bought this item at a store, but less expensive.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES THAT I HAVE SEEN SINCE LATTER DAY CAME OUT. IT IS A VERY SWEET MOVIE AND A CHARMING LOVE STORY. THIS MOVIE WAS MADE IN VERY GOOD TASTE. HAVE ALREADY WATCHED THIS MOVIE 3-4 TIMES.  5 STARS FOR SURE
B0013FSL3E|5.0|MY GRANDSON JUST LOVES THIS MOVIE.  HE FIRST WATCHED IT WITH HIS PARENTS WHEN IT WAS AT THE THEATER.  HE RECEIVED THE MOVIE FOR CHRISTMAS AS A GIFT.  HE ENJOYS WATCHING WITH HIS POP POP ON HIS THEATER SYSTEM.
B001FBIPF0|4.0|I had no idea who FOB was before I Don't Care was on the radio one day and the DJ said it was FOB singing.  I had heard Thnks fr th Mmrs a thousand times and while I thought it was catchy, had no idea who it was.<br /><br />Living in Chicago, though, there was more attention paid to this release locally and Pete Wentz and Ashlee Simpson making frequent appearances around town generated some buzz, so I downloaded the CD when it came out.<br /><br />I'm not by any means emo or anything remotely like it, but this CD is really good.  Apparently, judging from other reviews, that's because this CD is more pop-rock-funk and not emo at all, which is fine by me.<br /><br />I think the lead singer has an awesome voice and I think the songs are generally really catchy and fun to listen to.  Ultimately, if I want to listen to more than 3-4 songs on the same CD more than once, it's been a good investment.  In addition to I Don't Care, there are 4-5 others I really like, though the fact that their names make no sense at all, I would be hard pressed to name any of them. :)<br /><br />This project seems to be what It Won't be Soon Before Long was for Maroon 5 - their big breakout into the mainstream (read $$$) scene that generates scores of new fans but alienates those who only like bands that nobody else knows about because they feel somehow cool by association.<br /><br />Whatever.  If you like or dislike music because it is good or bad and not because of how cool/uncool you will look by the sheer association of having it in your Ipod, this is a great choice.
0316017922|3.0|My hubby got this book for Christmas, and we both read it at the beach over the holidays. It was a quick read, but the facts and numbers and continual restating of what you had previously read did bog us down somewhat. If you like trivia or like knowing useless info about others, this is your type of book. Otherwise, the material is nothing to write home about (or Amazon?)
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|What?  Me?  You want me to review The Complete Fourth Series of Doctor Who?  I'm not worthy.  Okay, enough of that, but this is no small task.  Where do I begin?    First things first.  Let's NOT presume that you're familiar with Doctor Who (which is or at least once was) the world's longest running science fiction television program.  Let's not take for granted you're aware of the fact that despite his outward appearance, Doctor Who or \\"the Doctor\\" as he is known to friends and foes, is an alien.  Let's also not presume that you know about the Doctor's TARDIS (a time machine that's bigger on the inside than it is on the outside) which permits him to travel backwards and forwards (sometimes even sideways) in time.  Head spinning yet?      The program is still relatively new to many even though the Doctor has been around for a very long time.  How long?  Factually speaking, as the central character of a television show which began in the early '60's, he's been with us for more than 40 years.  Fictionally speaking, the Doctor is over 900 years old, so it is safe to say he's not the new kid on the block.    While the Doctor tends to favor the human race, he values all life.  At first glance what sets him (technologically) apart from the rest is his ability to time travel.  When his writer's hit the mark, time traveling is not some far fetched farce but rather a closely guarded secret that members of his race do everything in their power to keep secret, otherwise chaos would reign.  Time traveling technology in the wrong hands has many potentially negative consequences, but that's another subject for another day.  Back to The Complete Fourth Series, which is what I have set my mind to review.    What about the production?  First rate.  There, that bit's done.  No?  You want more?  Okay, here goes... whether you're a newbie to the show or a seasoned fan, the current production standards are in step with the latest, and I do mean the latest technology.  Doctor Who has seen leaner days, when monsters were little more than creative Halloween costumes, sometimes less, and the sets wobbled, yes, wobbled.  Hopefully those days are gone (and for good) however they do give one a certain appreciation for today's Who.  It's real, very real, in your face real and not afraid to get even closer.  Got it?    If you want to be scared, Series Four delivers plenty of reasons to hide behind the sofa.  If you want to laugh, you will, just as you will weep, and sometimes all in the same episode!  That's why it's tough to pigeon-hole any given episode and why I will not attempt to do so here.  Call me lazy if you like, but others have beautifully summarized each episode and with far fewer words than I could, so instead I will ramble on in my own wordy way, hoping to strike a chord, one that you will hear again and again until you give in and at least test drive the program to see what all the fuss is about.    Doctor Who makes more sense when viewed episode to episode (from the very first to the most recent) so that you get to know the Doctor, his companions, and the inside scoop on what to the untrained ear sounds like sci-fi-techno-babble but is in actual fact just the show building on it's own lore, lore which spans the cosmos and all of time.  Having said that, today's Doctor Who does an admirable job of bringing new viewers up to speed without inducing a group coma amongst long time loyal fans.  Apart from the occasional cliff-hanging, cold-sweat, white-knuckled, tear-jerking, weak-in-the-knees, laugh-out-loud, and hair-on-the-back-of-your-neck-is-standing-at-attention two part season finale, each episode is a standalone adventure.  Say that about your favorite sit-com or soap.    The Doctor (a Timelord) has two hearts and possesses the ability to regenerate.  Regenerating is sort of like morphing, but not exactly.  He doesn't become someone or something else, he does however get a new lease on life each time he undergoes the process of regeneration.  Throughout as well as after his regeneration or rebirth he retains his memory though it is somewhat muddied at times.  His outward appearance changes, as does his demeanor and his voice, etc.  A very handy tool, one that permits creators and producers of the Doctor's adventures to keep things fresh by replacing an outgoing or current Doctor (or rather the actor that portrays him) with a new one.    Step into the TARDIS and you step into a reality that is, always has been, and always will be all around us, just hidden from plain view, a reality that's magical, mythical, defies the laws of physics and even good old common sense at times. This reality is inhabited by a (fictional) force for good in the form of a being that is not of this planet, not of this time, though his appearance and manners say otherwise.  Stay with the Doctor until episode's end and you may well be introduced to a completely new life-form, or perhaps plot with him to once again defeat a rather small but formidable number of long-time, if not life-long enemies.  Maybe you will travel back in time to discover the truth about a particular fact of history, then again you might arrive at a place where the stuff of fairy-tales becomes real.  It's all inside that wonderful blue box.    I won't delve into each episode of the Fourth Series, I wasn't asked to write a book, but a review.  Some might ask, \\"Has the review started?\\"  I will leave it to your curiosity to determine if this is the type of entertainment which is (at the very least) worth a look.  Don't take my word for it.  Search the web.  The Doctor is all over it.  Then come back here and get your goodies!    And what about the purchase?  Flawless.  Amazon does it right.  And if you ever have a problem with a purchase, count on them to be there for you to make it right, they did for me.    Happy Travels!

B001C08RHA|5.0|By far the best well-rounded superhero movie... not to cheesy, plenty of action, and a believable plot.    Can't wait for a sequel
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The Dark Knight is considered by many movie critics, fans, etc. as the ultimate movie of the Batman Series, partly due to: a) a fantastic crew of actors (including the late Heath Ledger in his outstandig performance as the Joker, perfomance that perhaps will grant him an Academy Award), and b) a well directed movie (Chris Nolan) with action, suspense, drama secuences that kept movie fans hook up at the screen. This movie is a must buy in any format (DVD - Blu Ray), but if you are in to the HI-DEF ERA, and you have all the equipment necessary to view a Movie in all his splendor, buy it right away in Blu-Ray format...
1572814748|5.0|I was already a proud owner of the Druidcraft Tarot but I wanted an actual Waite deck also.<br /><br />This deck is just like the large Universal Waite Tarot except the cards are about the size of regular playing cards - about 1/4 inch slimmer. The cards are all colorful, well-illustrated and easy to read. The back of the cards has a dark blue evening sky with clouds and an octagram in the center. I honestly like this deck better than the large version - much more space to give readings yet still good quality. This is not one of those cheaply-manufactured decks by any means.<br /><br />They are also very compact and easy to carry around. They come in a box with a top that comes off. The deck also includes a mini-booklet with all the meanings of the cards and a history of the Tarot. I couldn't be happier with this purchase (and I'm usually very picky).
0061537934|5.0|This book, The Art of Racing in the Rain, is such a wonderful feel-good book that you will want to reread. Buy a copy to keep for yourself, and one or two to give away. Hint: keep the tissue box close by!
B00003CXAA|3.0|I ordered this collection for a friend for Christmas. I placed the order 12/04/08, it finally showed up on the 23rd (2 days before Christmas). She loved the gift, but I was getting very worried that it would show up after Christmas. I feel 19 days to recieve your order is a little much. The DVD set was in great packaging. I guess all that matters is that it made it in time.

0307455874|5.0|Reading about history has always been a favorite past time of mine, ever since grade school, especially reading about real people, you know, before they became famous and they lost touch with the \\"working guy/girl\\".  I also enjoy Frank Capra movies but that's a subject for another review.  So, when I finally got around to reading President-elect Obama's \\"The Audacity of Hope\\" I wasn't expecting what happened.  I didn't just like it, I thoroughly enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down because it was so real.  I found myself questioning what I really believed in.  It was like I was having a heart-to-heart conversation with Senator Barack Obama, who just happened to have been elected President of the United States.  Now he's the President-elect Obama and I feel like I have this relationship with the, soon-to-be sworn-in, next President of the United States.      The title \\"The Audacity to Hope\\" explains why I liked the book so much, and it's because the book gives a good insight into who Barack Obama is.  In \\"The Audacity to Hope\\" President-elect Obama explains why he feels about being who he is, and as a result it makes me want to be a better person.  I believe that what he says is true, \\"that we have a stake in one another.\\"  John F. Kennedy was the only other President, in my life-time, that has given me cause to feel this way.  I want so much to believe him when he writes \\" that what binds us together is greater than what drives us apart.\\"  We are all one in so many ways.    The book is real because the man is real, he speaks from his heart and he is aware of the hearts of others.  He's aware of the millions of Americans who go about their business every day.  \\"Their lives are full of contradictions and ambiguities.\\"  He is aware that Americans understand that politics is a business and no longer a mission, . . . \\"they turn inward, away from the noise and rage and endless chatter.\\"  \\"A government that truly represents these Americans - that truly serves these Americans - will require a different kind of politics.\\"  President-elect Obama connects to American's  hope when he writes, \\"That politics will need to reflect our lives as they are actually lived.\\"  He states \\"And we will need to remind ourselves, despite all our differences, just how much we share: common hopes, common dreams, a bond that will not break.\\"  Again, testimony to how we as human beings are all one.    Barack Obama is aware of his strengths and also his weaknesses.  In \\"The Audacity of Hope\\"  Barack Obama expresses his feelings on both sides of many important issues and yet he is not closed minded to his critics.  \\"I'd begun to see how any challenge to convention harbored within it the possibility of its own excesses and its own orthodoxy.\\"    In the beginning of \\"the Audacity of Hope\\" President-elect Obama writes, \\"Instead what I offer is something more modest: personal reflections on those values and ideals that have led me to public life.\\"  I believe that is exactly what he has done in this book.  I also believe him when he quotes Benjamin Franklin saying: \\"I would rather have it said, He lived usefully, than, He died rich\\" another reason why we are all one.
B001NE80P4|5.0|I am a big fan of the High School Musical series I can't wait for number 4 with the freshmen cast. I own all 3 soundtracks. I am not a fan of widescreen movies. I think the regular and the 2 disc exended edition should be Full Screen and widescreen. Also the blu ray edition in widescreen only.
0689835604|5.0|My daughter, now 2 1/2, loves all her Karen Katz books!! We've had to tape many of the flaps but, its been worth it!! She's learned so many things from these books since we first started buying them (at age 6 mos.): lifting the flaps, where and what her body parts are, what \\"behind\\", \\"under\\" & etc. mean, and even colors and shapes and family members too. I would recommend a Karen Katz book to anyone with children.
068817776X|5.0|This book will remain in my mind and heart forever.  The author's story was compelling, but the writing style and candor is what set this book part.  I could 'see' through the author's eyes and into her heart.  I could not put this book down.  This book should be required reading for every history class.      As the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, I have encountered a variety of people with different accounts, this one is by far the most unique and has provoked new thoughts about the subject.
074322454X|5.0|Ambrose is the master historian. He made history interesting again. He does it by telling the stories of regular people -- not armies, not generals, not national leaders, but rather,  the common GI Joe. He did all veterans a great service in his writing. He will be missed. Don't think you know this book just because you've watched the HBO series a dozen times -- you must read the book.
B00000I41G|5.0|As far as remastering goes, this is one of the most pleasant listening experiences I've heard recently (although I'm not a hi-tec geek - just a music geek). As far as music goes, this is probably one of the best albums I've recently rated on the amazon... Comparisson to Billie Holiday might seem silly (might even be silly), but I think that Kenny's feeling for the blues is similar to Lady Day's - she sang blueish whatever she sang, and she very rarely sang the blues!<br /><br />This wonderful blue note album is full of the similar emotion and the similar musical subtlety in at first glance quite simple tunes... If you don't believe me, just listen to the sole standard of the album \\"Gee Baby, Ain't I Good to You\\" - a blue-tinged song, not a blues.<br /><br />Since my feeling for this album is shared by almost every other contributor to this site I'll stop here and give my warm and blue five stars to Burrel, Stanley Turrentine (ts), Major \\"The Mule\\" Holley Jr. (b), Bill English (dm) and Ray Barretto who enriches the groove with his congas.<br /><br />BTW, this beautifuly designed edition feature's new liner notes and the original liner notes written by Leonard Feather. Listen. Enjoy.
B00003CXBK|5.0|Another interesting movie from Hayao Miyazaki.  This story is about what hatred can do to your soul and how your attitude affects you and those around you.  It encourages cooperation and although everyone doesn't live happily ever after, ends with a satisfying conclusion.  These movies always contain some moral or cultural message for viewers.  My kids are 12 and 16 and they want to collect everything Miyazaki has done.  Others they enjoy:  Kiki's Delivery Service, Castle In the Sky, Spirited Away, Porco Rosso, My Neighbor Totoro, Howl's Moving Castle.  I'm so glad Disney has become involved in getting these films out to the masses.
031606792X|5.0|Come on guys, there are lots of reviews in here that have HUGE spoilers(like why even read the book now spoilers)without so much as warning people by typing SPOILERS. Some people still want to be surprised. I just think people should try to be considerate of the people who haven't read it yet. Would you like it if you were REALLY looking forward to a movie and right before you see it, as you're in line to buy the tickets, someone tells you the big twist at the end? I just wish people would be more careful. :( Now I know the whole story and it would've been nice to be surprised, like most of the other readers got to be. Thanks for nothin.
0060882611|5.0|What can you say that hasn't already been said about this delightful classic? I love to read books to my children that I read when I was child. It always brings back great memories. This book is larger in size than I anticipated, about the same size as a 8x11 piece of copy paper. I guess that's what they mean when they call it the 'Read-Aloud Edition'. However, I am pleased with the larger size, as I originally intended to read it primarily to my 6 1/2 year-old, but I think it will also hold the attention (for at least a few minutes or so!)of my 3 year old with bigger pictures and such. I'm very much looking forward to revisiting this charming story!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|You either love the movie or hate it. But how's the home version?    Technically it's fine. It looks good but I can't comment on the sound.    The extra features however are amazing. I love how the features look into arguably the two most interesting parts of Batman: his equipment and the character himself. And the great part about the second one is that Batman's villains are also discussed.    The disc with the movie on it has the \\"making of ...\\" which goes into the Batpod, and how the some of the better scenes (Tumbler and garbage truck, flipping the semi, etc.) are made. Which is very good.    I haven't tried out the feature that allows you to make your own commentary but the idea of it sounds cool. It's unfortunate though that I have to sign up for something to even make one.    To wrap up: If you want this to own the movie, get it. If you want this for the other things it offers, get it.
B00005NG9Z|4.0|This is a good dvd with AICs videos, but I wish there was more behind the scenes and interview material from throughout their existence. These guys were good and played hard without being cheesy or whining like everyone does now.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  The characters, although animated robots, have great emotions and relationship development.  There is even a strong save the earth message.  However, the best part is seeing what happens to the humans after years of time saving shortcuts, sitting around, and not exerting any energy.  Voice activated gadgets, remote start for my car, TV remotes, won't be long till we get to the \\"cupcake in a cup\\" stage.  A definite classic.  Way to go Pixar... again!
0385493622|4.0|While the overall theme of the book was how mathematician Andrew Wiles proved Fermat's last theorem, author Simon Singh used this event as the venue for discussing the history of number theory. Singh is able to do this because Wiles used a variety of techniques developed by earlier mathematicians. And here lies the great strength of the book.<br /><br />The history of the math was described two ways, the actual math which was largely incomprehensible and biographies of the mathematicians which were warm, compelling and a delight to read. Some of the notable mathematical personalities discussed were the Greek mathematicians Pythagoras and Euclid, as well as Europeans Leonhard Euler, David Hilbert, and Alan Turing. The chapter \\"A mathematical disgrace\\" was particularly compelling for it discussed the maltreatment of women in mathematics, most notably Sophie Germaine and Emmy Nother. Also quite interesting was Singh's comparison of proof in mathematics versus experimental science, with the former relying on logic and the latter on reproducible observations.<br /><br />Overall the writing style was very accessible and easy to understand (aside from the math) and the biographies were fascinating. This book was well worth reading for anyone interested in the history of science or mathematics, and the beauty of the biographies more than compensates for some difficult math. This should not be a surprise because Singh's Big Bang was a terrific read.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This series very made very well made. Pleasantly suprised.  My whole family was able to enjoy these with the exception of having to fast forward two parts (just because of my extra small children).  I would highly recommend this series for anyone wanted to get a look at John Adams and the world in his time.

B0000797IO|4.0|Poor, pitiful Justine (Jennifer Aniston) works her days away in a dreary predictable discount store and returns home at day's end to her painter husband and his slimy sidekick, who together spend their nights ensconced on the couch smoking dope and watching mindless television.  We see in her listless, slumped shoulder walk the look of desperation and resignation.  How can we feel anything but empathy and pity for Justine, for the life to which she has been condemned?  Is the director making us a witness to yet another yarn about the stifling dullness and  persistent hopelessness of the small town cocoon?<br /><br />One day out of the fog of dreariness and predictability a new male employee at Justine's place of employment catches her eye.  The young man, who is roughly 9 years her junior, is, as we discover, a candidate in good standing for bipolar poster child of the year.  The young man has shed his \\"Slave Name\\" Tom and adopted the name of Holden, because he sees himself as the embodiment of the main character in Catcher in the Rye.  Justine is attracted to his impetuous and flamboyant personality, because she sees in him an escape from her horrid dull life.  As the relationship develops and moves from the mental and spiritual to the physical, Justine withdrawals more and more from her friends and responsibilities.  She and her beau nouveau are lost in each other and the possibility of a better life somewhere else.  All is going swimmingly until Justine and her Holden are discovered by Justine's husband's sidekick as they emerge from the hotel room after one of their romps in their field of dreams.  Things get very complicated after that.<br /><br />As a result of being found out Justine is forced to make other compromises to hide the extent of her relationship with Holden.  This is very taxing for Justine and at one time she even considers religion as an answer to her dilemma.  Holden also becomes very upset when he discovers some of what Justine has done to cover up their dalliances.  To the very end Justine makes decisions and lies to protect herself, while Holden tragically disappears from the picture.<br /><br />What is the lesson, message or insight that we the viewer should take away from this movie.  At first glance it seems a simple tale about the consequences of the choices we make in life.  Each step we take will to a great extent determine what the next step after that will be.  After letting this movie run around in my head for a few days, I have decided that the Good Girl is perhaps the psychological dialectic to the Garden of Eden story.  In Eden, Adam and Eve had everything they needed to make them happy and in The Good Girl, Justine and Holden believed that because of where they lived and how they lived that they had nothing of what they needed to make them happy, to fulfill there dreams.  Out of these two different worlds, one full of hope and one, from full of despair we see the rise of the same human impulse to break away, to change, even though, the provocations that engendered the need to change things were different, both Adam and Eve and Justine and Holden had to change because the sameness of their lives was too stifling.  Perhaps the lesson is that it is ok to break away, to explore more deeply that which makes us human, but do so with your eyes open. Who knows? maybe God wanted Adam and Eve to leave Eden. Perhaps the lesson is that what we don't have always looks more appealing and feels more desirable than what we do have, and the key is not getting what we want but wanting what we have. In both cases, I think we do have a choice, and for that, we are always responsible.lliances.

B00011F5DK|4.0|We have a lot of fun playing this game.  Our youngest is 6 years old, and she can play strategically.  Great thinking game. A fun way to develop critical thinking.  Definitely need more than two people to make it a competitive game. Which is the only reason I gave it 4 stars not 5.
031606792X|4.0|This book just closes the story perfectly...actually her last two books are my favorite b/c the story/plot and character build up is so great...but her writing did annoy me until I just plowed through it - b/c the story is that good, it was easy to read this within a day...just her writing style is not that great... not your Thomas Mann or Ayn Rand. But I would definitely pass it along to my daughters when they come of age.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|MAgnifica serie. EL paquete el bellisimo y viene con un cd extra, adem&aacute;s de todas las temporadas.

B001KMB6YG|1.0|This is a review of the DVD itself not the movie!    Don't waste you time on this movie. I saw this movie in the theaters and was severely disappointed in the DVD. The movie is missing several scenes that may or may not add to the plot line but for me were still part of the movie. If your familiar with the movie you will recognize the absence of the chase and ending scene with Vin and the two children. I believe they CUT an extra 10-15 minutes from the movie. You will also notice a change in some of the voice over during the beginning of the movie.  I like the movie, its worth watching but not this version.

031606792X|3.0|I didn't hate Breaking Dawn like a lot of the twilight community did, but to say that I loved it is also a far cry from the truth as well.  At first I loved the beginning; Edward and Bella finally got married and had a wonderful honeymoon, things were looking up, but then everything changed.    I feel like Meyer got stuck half way through, like she dug herself into this hole and had trouble getting out of it.  There were points where the book dragged where you just wanted to say, \\"Oh come on lets move onto something different.\\"  I think the biggest problem I had with the book was that it felt nothing like the Twilight series.  When I was reading it I didn't feel like I was reading the original Twilight series, I felt like I was reading some sort of fanfiction or something along those lines.  I know most people always say that ALL of Meyer's writing reads like fanfiction but Breaking Dawn really does.  If you like the Twilight series then I feel that you have to at least read Breaking Dawn, it does give closer only to me the closer was a little too sweet, like everything had to come together in this perfect circle and make everything perfect which is kind of boring.  I don't hate it but one of my least favorite out of the Twilight series.
031606792X|4.0|The final book drew the characters together very well in an interesting story line; but it wasn't her best in the saga since there were a few wild ideas thrown in that just didn't make sense to me. For example: a 1-2 month gestation period, and the rapid rate of growth of the child. We know from the example of Jesus Christ, being 1/2 mortal & 1/2 immortal, that His gestation period was the normal 9 months and He grew up in the normal fashion. The author's idea of changing that mortal process was farfetched, and the reader really got lost in fantasy land. I lost interest in the book after reading through that section, although I did finish it.
B00000IL29|5.0|A little place called Twins Lounge where I got to hang out with some of the better jazz musicians in and out of the main concourses of DC and elsewhere; I used to torture the players to play the only jazz song I really enjoyed and felt confortable with: \\"Maiden Voyage\\". I knew that piece was the entrainment in my brain to know something of what jazz was. The musicians got to know I would ask them to play this song and patiently gave me my reward. The thing still blesses me with good feeling.
0312370849|3.0|I have taught the Holocaust for years, been to the museum in D.C. more times that I can count, been to survivor talks, read countless books, watched movies, researched online, etc.  I thought I knew a lot about what happened and who the perpetrators were.  This novel presented details that rocked my confidence in my own knowledge.      The events portrayed in this novel deal with the round up of Jews in Paris, by the Paris police, and the subsequent treatment in holding areas and camps, till the Jews were eventually sent to several concentration camps.  What made this event seem even more cruel then others was the round up was put together by the neighborhood police.  The man who helped your daughter cross the street after school came knocking on your door demanding you leave immediately.      If the author had stuck to tracing one Jewish family and their trials, defeats, and eventual victories, I would have rated this book much higher.  Instead the author chose to alternate the story taking place during WWII with a modern day tale of an American in Paris.  The American reporter is dealing with a rocky marriage to an aristocratic Parisian man, in-laws who do not respect her, an unwanted pregnancy, a wish to go home to New York, gay friends who host large dinner parties, a sister who is to busy for her, a daughter who is wise beyond her years, deadlines from her demanding and uncaring boss, and a struggle with how to write an article on a topic that Paris would rather ignore.  There is just too much going on, too much of it is hopelessly cliche, and hopelessly predictable.

B00166QJRU|4.0|Back when I was still in high school David Bowie played at the Santa Monica Civic Auditorium (California) and the concert was broadcast live on Los Angeles radio station KMET FM 94.7 (now defunct).  There were a lot fewer \\"rock\\" stars back in 1972 than today.  Even though Bowie's first album came out in 1967, there was still a bit of a mystery or mystique about him and his sexuality back then.  There was a buzz in town about the concert -- his first in the area, hard to imagine now.      I set up my stereo receiver and reel-to-reel tape deck and recorded the concert off-the-air.  It turned out to be a really great performance and from what I've read, one of his best ever.  Years later all the belts in my old reel-to-reel streched out so the deck no longer worked.  So I never got around to copying the show to a cassette tape.  A few months ago (November 2008), I had a musician friend copy my old tape to a CD-R for me.  For some technical reason the second side of my original tape did not correctly copy.  So I ended up with about 2/3 of the concert.      I then started searching through Amazon.com for \\"David Bowie Santa Monica\\" and was surprised to find that there have been commercial CD's of this concert put out.  I was also glad to find that at least a couple versions (releases) were still available.  So I purchased the \\"boxed\\" version.  It is a great CD for an older live recording.  I gave it an over all rating of 4 stars, but I feel the performance itself rates 4 & a half stars.  But since the live recording techniques of the early 1970's were not what they are today, I would give it 3 & a half for sound or fidelity.  It is still a pretty good live recording.  And I really have been enjoying the CD album.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I loved this movie.  The writing, scenery and most especially the actors were all amazing!  I just finished watching and I already want to see it again.  It's a movie that surpasses sexuality and is quite simply an extremely well done love story.  If you want to own a great \\"gay\\" movie... this is one for your collection.
B000002LGA|3.0|Dirty Boulevard is cliched and sounds like Lou coasting. Whenever   he tries to sound tough it bores me rigid. Romeo had Juliet. No kidding? along with tea and toast probably.  The fun, exciting, belligerent Lou is not here. That's back on 'Take No Prisoners' and the smooth honest melodic one isn't either that can be found on 'Coney Island Baby'.    Lous' photograph book of N.Y.C.is much more enjoyable than this L.P.  Keep up the good work there man!  Lou Reed is a great place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there.
B000EOTEPO|5.0|great brutal, Black metal. This has to be Immortals best release! A must have for anyone who likes Black metal!
B001ECQ75A|3.0|It's a fun movie-I've seen it before and like it.   But I ordered it over a month ago and still haven't received it in the mail.  I don't know what happened, but I've emailed the company I bought it from twice, and still no response.  I'm obviously very disappointed with this service.
B001C08RHA|5.0|This film has a little of everything for everyone.  Great writing, great actors and wonderful CGI.  I was never a comic book fan, but in the past decade Marvel has lured me into seeing what the big fascination has been all about.  When one franchise begins to falter (Spider Man) a new one comes onto the scene and takes everyone's breath away.  I only had a few gripes-one Downey's 1940's fast talking/ scarastic delivery some times comes off muffled and who's big idea was it to have such small font on the scenes where translation was needed?  It reminded me of the small print in shady contracts.  Do they really expect people to be able to read it?  Other than that-it is great entertainment and I'm looking forward to the next installment to the series.
B001FOPODS|5.0|[[ASIN:B001FOPODS Peter and the Wolf]]  We were all very pleased with the video- all three generations from our 8 year old grandaughter to her 63 year old grandmother. It was an excellent choice. We will watch this video many times over.
B000X1BPYQ|5.0|This a great album from Rotting Christ. The music and vocals are intense and very well put together. I was blown away at how well the music sounds. Great recommandation if you are looking into buying your first Rotting Christ album.
B001EZ78T6|5.0|This is an amazing album!!  John Legend has one of the best voices of our generation.  I love this album so much.  Every song is really good vs. some albums that only feature one or two really good songs.  I think the rhythms are amazing.  \\"Green light\\" is witty and clever. I love the depth of the multiple chorus play with the lyrics. I highly recommend the album.  It will make you feel fantastic!!!
B001DDBCUK|3.0|This movie serves just one purpose: to appeal to women ultimate girly side.  It is literally a Vogue movie-where the idea that ordinary women actually can have million dollar wardrobes, incredible apartments in a fabulous city all supported by a job that couldn't possibly support such a lifestyle.  Carrie would have to be a more famous writer than the script is leading on.  But onto the main story between Carrie and Mr. Big.  The wedding.  Is it me or did the whole thing just feel contrived?  The whole plot was carried by the fact that Carrie just wouldn't talk to Big.  That's it.  Now even that doesn't sound believable.  The resolution: she sees him-and everything is all right.  Uh huh.  Is it any surprise that control freak-Miranda and her wimpy boyfriend hit a big patch in the road?  Does anyone believe that peace will last for long?  I can't see what Steve sees in this pushy, bossy woman in the first place.  Charlotte was tolerable because she didn't have anything to contribute to the film and Samantha NEEDS to settle down because she's two seconds away from everything on her body to start sagging permanently--and I definitely don't want to see that on the big screen.  Frankly, this franchise needs to experiment with a new group of girls.  It's time.
B001E1EOQ0|4.0|The disc is marked as Region B, but is actually All Regions. I had no problems playing either disc in my Sony BDP-S350. The video quality is great (4-stars) and the DTS-HD MA audio is absolutely amazing (5-stars)! All of the extras are on disc 2 and in mpeg-2 standard definition. The disc I got was not from 101 DISTRIBUTION, but rather Twentieth Century Fox.<br /><br />So don't worry about it being marked as region B.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|This is a Good brutal black metal album from behemoth. The music is intense and very good. This is a good recommandation for anyone looking for a good behemoth release. They're best to date in my opinion, vocals are superb as well.
B000816TCY|5.0|Something I learned from my experienced of buying battery(ies) from a secondary brand...Busted!  They may be cheap, and boy o boy, they are 'cheap' alright.     I bought an extra secondary brand battery from an electronic store not so long ago, to replace the old (original) one. But I couldn't get any power into the camera. Only good for a few shots, then the warning sign of battery exhausted appear.  Then, I searched internet for the original Nikon Lithium battery, I found one in Amazon/Adorama for &18.90. I ordered right away, and package came 3 days later. Charged it, used it, and it stayed on, and on and on... You got the idea.   It works very well! No complain whatsoever with the product nor the service.   Great stuff. Thanks Amazon/Adorama.
1400079276|5.0|My girlfriend gave me this book as a gift.  She told me the bookstore where she picked it up kept Murakami books behind the counter due to shoplifting issues.  This should give you some indication of how good it is.  If kids want to shoplift your book I bet it's freaking great.  And you know...it really is.  Magical, Compelling, Simple, Surreal.  It's all of those things.  Prior to reading this book I wasn't a real big surreal fiction fan, but Murakami is a true artist and master of the genre.  The translations are spot on.  The writing is smooth.  The descriptions are vivid.  I highly recommend this book to anyone open minded enough, courageous enough, bored enough, interested to read it.  You'll like it.
0743289684|5.0|A story of a young girl who grew up in a poor country under ISLAM.  Her story of how she lived in different countries and why she decided to leave  ISLAM.  Her trials and tribulations are real and very well written.  You will not want to put this book down after you start reading.
B000FP2ZCQ|5.0|Great Death Metal!! This is one good band who often is not heard off. This is a recommandation for any person who likes great Death Metal.
0312360266|4.0|What is interesting about this book is the unusual world this story is set in.  It really drew me in with it's take on the vampyre myth and wiccan culture.  I had gotten it from the library and read it in one day.<br /><br />Zoey is a fascinating character, and there are several moments in her inner monologue that had me laughing out loud.  She goes from being ignored and misunderstood in her human life to finding a place she fit in and friends in her new Vampyre life.  She has magic, a special bond with her Cherokee heritage, and finds a cool new boyfriend.  She has the kind of life all of us wish we could find.  I absouluetly loved reading this book and losing myself in her voice.<br /><br />The book deals with certain situations all teenagers face, from drinking and drugs to emerging sexuality.  It had a realistic point of view while not going too far to sound pompous and unbelievable.<br /><br />With that said, there were only a couple of things that felt off from the book, and that's why I didn't give it five stars.  First, Eric as a boyfriend wasn't as strong as he should have or could have been.  I hope in the sequel he grows more and becomes an asset to Zoey instead of just decoration.  Second, how the Vampyres \\"know\\" things were slightly off.  In one part they seem to have eyes in the back of their heads, but then they can't figure out the scheming and power hungry bad girl, Aphrodite.<br /><br />This book was very satisfying and I would definitely give it a chance, especially if you are a fan of such stories like \\"Twilight\\", \\"Vamprie Academy\\", \\"Evernight\\", and even \\"Harry Potter\\".
B000002AGN|5.0|No jazz lover should be without this. I have loved it since I bought the vinyl in 1963.<br />In fact, music lovers in general will probably like it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I loved the movie Serenity, but had never seen the show.  I was skeptical that a Sci-Fi type series would really appeal to me.  The series was GREAT!  It's futuristic, space-age meets old-West cowboys & bandits.  The characters are engaging, the dialogue hilarious, and the concept quietly ingenious.  I highly recommend the series.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|I absolutely love the Jonas Brothers.  Every song on this CD is great!!  I am 42 so the Jonas Brothers don't just appeal to the teenage age group.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|I wasn't sure how excited I was to see this movie, but it has quickly become one of my favorites.  The animation is top notch, and the cast is star studded, though I have to admit I had to watch the special features to put faces with voices.  It seemed to me that this movie would be the typical \\"unlikely hero that changes into one\\" story, but the way that \\"Po\\" is written adds spice to this genre of character.  It was nice to see a chubby hero for a change.  You will laugh and be amazed at the kung fu moves and the speed of the story.  A definite must see.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|It must have been a very daunting task to create a biopic about Gandhi. He is still a sacrosanct figure through much of the world, an incredible amount of history happened throughout his lifetime, but also because, as a protagonist, Gandhi went from a regular lawyer to a major figurehead of peace and Indian independence- quite an arc to effectively show to an audience. However, this film does an incredible job in humanizing the man, and distilling his accomplishments to a three-hour cinematic experience.<br /><br />What I appreciate about the film is how well it shows Gandhi's maturation to the figure he became, while backing up his growth with the major political events that he is most associated with (the Amristar Massacre, the Salt March, the India/Pakistan riots, etc.). Throughout the film are well-done, nuanced scenes with Gandhi, reporters, and his counsellors that help to flesh him out and explain the peaceful philosophy he tried so hard to instill in his people.<br /><br />Ben Kingsley is astonishing as the man. He is never less than altogether believable. His strength is palpable, as well as his sorrow when things do not go as he meant them to, and his teachings turn to violence. Altogether this is an incredibly distinguished, entertaining and vital film. Everyone needs to know this man's story. See it and keep him with you.

1573228737|5.0|Pace and a good story, that's all I want and this book delivers.  Miss Margaret Prior, recovering from some personal shock, is advised to spend some time visiting a women's prison in London.  There she meets a number of colourful characters appropriately reeking of Dickens and Bronte.  She becomes obsessed and taken in by a particularly stunning and suffering young lady who possesses spiritual powers.  It is because of these gifts that this alluringly pale Miss Dawes is now serving time, having conducted a seance that went awry, to put it simply.  Miss Prior visits regularly, speculates and finally plots an escape for Miss Dawes.  Here the plot cannot be revealed but I don't mention pace and story for nothing.  Wonderful stuff!  You expect The Woman in White or the theatrical The Woman in Black, anything to satisfy the desire and expectation of the macabre and other-worldly, but this is a more bitter and realistic story.    Juicy depiction of 19th century London, of contrasts between life on Cheyne Walk and life in the prison near London Bridge, of life at home as a spinster daughter to a difficult mother, of a love that cannot even be defined let alone nurtured.     I didn't think I would be taken in by the occult subject of this book, but the historical details and characters are so vivid that I was completely charmed.  Sarah Waters is a top writer.  I've read them all and can't wait for more of her books.
B000YAA68C|5.0|I absolutely love this movie - after seeing it, I believe I'm destined to marry Gerard Butler. He is basically the perfect man. Very romantic, very funny, great cast. Would highly recommend.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|OMG!!!   I LOVE this show!!! Blood,Sex,Humor, an actual vampire story line!!! I'm not a freak and dress in black but I'm a mild vamp fan. my favorite movie is the lost boys and like Anne Rice. This show is my new favorite and I'm counting down the days until this comes out on video so I can re watch them. If your NOT into vamps its ok because this show is still entertaining to anyone guaranteed! just found out that there are books and I'm all over it. Oh and did I mention I LOVE the show?
B001GKYBXA|1.0|I almost always like what Paul McCartney does. Paul can tap-dance on a buffalo chip, and I'll enjoy it. But, to me, this set of songs was just awful. There were a couple songs that I didn't hate very much, but I mostly hated them a lot.    I'm not a professional critic, so I can't articulate my reasons for my position very well. Basically, it just seemed sloppy, with little thought behind it, and an enormous amount of padding to lengthen the songs.    This is very odd for me. As I said, I almost always like what McCartney does. But for some reason, I didn't connect with this in any good way at all.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|When I heard the critics had said this was their best album since Back in Black (1980), I thought \\"Oh dear!, That can't be good\\"  - only because critics tend to say these things without being convincing. This album is brilliant, as AC/DC albums go.     Buy it! Then get tickets to see them live, if possible. I saw them in 1992 and they put on a GREAT show!
B001EOQWFI|5.0|This is truly Blue Ray at it's finest! It's one thing to watch a movie with real people in it, and another thing completely to watch Pixar's digital animation shine. The crystal clear picture, makes this movie good, even when you don't like the storyline.     I must say that the movie itself was slightly bland. Though it is directed at children, I don't think most would really understand it all. The first hour provides amazing graphics, and musical classics, but in the line of conversation and \\"talking\\", you don't get much within the first hour. This can be an issue for a 4-year-old with a low attention span.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I won't comment on the format because I saw this movie in theaters and haven't bought it yet. But don't worry; even though it's been months, I haven't forgotten a single thing about it. It's one of those movies that sticks in your head.<br /> When Heath Ledger died and his last movie, this one, received a huge amount of attention I figured that his death was being used to create hype for the film and I thought it was pretty low of all involved. Now I think it's an awful pitty he wasn't around for it's release. He would have had a right to be proud.<br /> Honestly, I haven't seen most of Ledger's movies, only a few(including A Knight's Tale which I really liked) so I didn't realize he was such an amazing actor and wasn't expecting him to totally re-invent the Joker rather than reprise Jack Nicholson's role(the Joker's origin is never made clear here but, obviously, it's not the same as from the comics, various series' or the original Batman movie). His portrayal is completely original and different but so right for the character!<br /> But Heath Ledger's performance is only one reason why The Dark Knight was so fantastic. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are back, of course(Katie Holmes is barely missed), and then there's Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent/Two-Face(also re-invented and brilliantly;Tommy Lee Jones was awful as Two-Face in Batman Forever. Still, to be fair, Jim Carey was worse as Riddler) and a whole host of other actors that I can't even begin to name who give this movie amazing depth. Also, another thing that sets The Dark Knight apart from most other superhero movies, and even most fiction, is the smooth way everything flows and seems so easy to believe. With this movie characters that some of us have known forever came alive like never before. The characters have completely overshadowed their origins.<br /> The tragedy here manages not to bog down the story which was surprisingly steady and consistent, and the Joker is funny in a sick kind of way. Also, in contrast, there is a certain ironic optimism toward humanity that kind of lightens the mood (the convicts vs. the citizens part for instance). And still they managed to pose some interesting questions concerning Batman's morality, sense of justice, and the possible overall impact of his very existence(batmen with machine guns, anyone?).<br /> It's pretty mind-blowing, isn't it, to realize that these characters originated with Batman himself in kid's comics in the 1940's, over sixty years ago. Once again, a long movie but, once again, worth watching.of way.

B001GJ3VYG|5.0|If you are a Dido fan and enjoyed her past works, then I believe you will<br />also like this album. Key tracks include: look no further, don't believe in love, quiet times, northern skies, and summer. As always that amazing voice of hers shines through. In that voice you can hear the longing, desire, and hunger that as human beings we all share and can so easily relate to. I believe it gets better with repeated listening too and the melodies begin to play in your head. Safe Trip Home is a Safe bet Purchase.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|Planet Earth by the BBC on Blu-ray has received rave reviews by many folks and hardly needs another by me. In a word, it is awesome.  However, the mechanical design of the disk holders is terrible.  I almost break the disk each time I remove a disk from its holder.  The center catch is just too stiff and no matter how hard I push on it the disk doesn't release. There are several superior center holder designs, why doesn't the industry settle on the few that work and stopping using the ones that don't?

B0000028SR|4.0|After a 3 year absence, almost anything by Bruce would have been welcome, even without E St Band. Having said that, this was a very good album. However, I always thought that Lucky Town was the better of the two - better songs, and more uplifting with it's message. If you don't own either or both, get them to help fill out your collection. My favorite thing is to hear Bruce and the E St Band perform some of these live in concert - wish they would do more of them.
B00006LLOG|5.0|Transformer is just fantastic from beginning to end.      Compared to other glam rock albums such as Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and Electric Warrior, I feel Transformer is slightly better than those (particulaly because T-Rex and David Bowie have better albums than the two mentioned above, but the same can't be said for Lou Reed, though one can argue Berlin comes close).    Glam rock can be an absolute delight to listen to when done right, and Transformer is just highly enjoyable songwriting the entire way.  Just great, that's all I can really say about it.  Buy it now.  I can't really pick a favorite song, but \\"Andy's Chest\\" and \\"Vicious\\" jump out to me immediately as being highlights.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Purchased Lost as a pre-sale item.  What a great way to purchase in demand items. It arrived here in very quicly and in perfect condition.
B000002O5L|5.0|Despite having numerous hits before releasing this album, it took until we heard the ultra famous \\"Free Fallin\\" and \\"I Won't Back Down\\" to REALLY establish Tom Petty as one of radios favorite musicians at the time.  With this album, now everyone knew very well who Tom Petty was.  Before this, while he was still popular (especially with that late 70's album he did) I remember how his popularity sky rocketed after Full Moon Fever was released.  I recommend the album too.  With so many great quality tracks, you HAVE to buy it.
061891868X|5.0|I like how the author is willing to point out the problems within the scientific movement in general, including his own particular field.  I don't feel he unfairly bashes string theory, as some other reviewers have claimed, as he is willing to bash loop gravity as well.  Reviewers claiming he is just bashing the group (string theory) that gets the most funding because he is not in the \\"in crowd\\" is pretty stupid, given that most reviewers here who criticize Smolin of this are similary not in the \\"in crowd\\" among the reviewers here.  Those reviewers claim that as a result of the way Smolin \\"bashes\\" string theory, he loses credence.  It seems that for similar reasons, one could argue Smolin's negative reviewers lose credence.
B00005MNP8|5.0|I have a confession to make- one of the big reasons I love Blondie's music so much is because of some key memories in my life.  When I was about five years old in the mid 80's, my mom and aunt would drive around all over Delaware, Pennsylvania and Maryland shopping for things, and there I was in the backseat just jamming to Blondie cassette tapes my mom and aunt would bring with them on the trips.    As I grew up, my tastes began to change as I preferred to hear all kinds of different stuff such as progressive rock and heavy guitar rock (just to name a few phases I went through) but even during these times, I would still think very highly of Blondie's incredible singing skills and the bands extremely strong songwriting abilities.      Now that I'm an adult, I can approach Blondie's music without caring much about popularity or anything else, so it's very safe for me to say Blondie's music flat out RULES!    One song that really floors me with Deborah's singing style is \\"Fade Away and Radiate\\".   Talk about a song that can honestly make you think heaven is right here right now!      Also I want to mention my dad was absolutely obsessed with Blondie's good looks growing up in the 70's.  That may have been one of the reasons he liked her so much!  I don't think my mom was too pleased with his obsession though.     I think the thing that's really neat about Blondie's music is how it appeals to just about everyone.  I mean, you might think of the music as really catchy and exciting pop music, but another person might think it rocks hard enough to please hard rock fans.      Also I believe Blondie influenced thousands of the female pop bands that are out there today.  It's amazing to think Deborah Harry finally made a big comeback after all these years, but most of us will always appreciate the albums she was a part of in the 70's.
B0002V7ODI|4.0|Well it isn't better than spider man that's for sure, but its still good fun. Hellboy never caught by immediate attention when it first came out. I didn't watch the movie until the sequel was released on DVD. Now was the movie worth watching when it first came out in theaters...Well...Yeah, this is a very different and unique comic book adaptation. The visual effects are stupendous; and the action is non stop.<br /><br />The movie explains briefly the origins of Hellboy. It all begins in 1944 with Professor Trevor Bruttenholm and a group of soldiers. They are sent out to Scotland to stop German Nazis from opening a portal to another world. In the process of course something comes out from the other world, and obviously that is our protagonist Hellboy.  Later in 2004,someone has returned to open the portal and unleash hell...how nice right?<br /><br />I give credit to the movie for being very original and fresh. The effects are superb through the majority of the film. Guillermo Del Torro has managed to adapt a very clever movie that gives you laughs, drama, horror, and an understanding of a hero who has been out casted from the real world. This is well worth owning, especially on the 3 disc directors cut, which contains hundreds of special features and runs 10 min longer than the theatrical cut.<br /><br />MY PERSONAL RATING: 3 ½ OUT OF 5
B00000637V|4.0|I'm entering Lou Reed not a fan of either his solo career and definitely NOT the Velvet Underground, so of course I have to ask the question \\"Why does Lou Reed whisper and talk-sing through most of his music?\\"      Well, keeping that WELL in mind while listening to his Berlin album, I have to say, I think I'm starting to get it.  I think I'm starting to understand what makes his vocal style so appealing- if you pay attention to the lyrics, the appeal of his vocal style will improve as well.      And that's exactly what happened.  I really like Berlin now, but I didn't particularly care for the album very much when I first heard it.  I kept thinking his music lacked substance upon first listen, but now I've changed my mind.    Some of these lyrics are INCREDIBLY dark.  Lyrics that are much different from the Elton John and Jim Croce lyrics people were exposed to at the time.    So if you go in approaching Lou Reed's music from a lyrics point of view, I believe you will learn to appreciate much of his music.  \\"The Bed\\" is probably the most shocking song to me because of those devastating lyrics.  That's truly an incredible song.  There's some solid rockers on the first side as well.      Overall, yeah, it's worth owning.

B00001OH7X|5.0|First of all, I want to say I will NOT be listening to these late 70's David Bowie albums very often (Heroes, Low, and Lodger) because for some reason, they give me incredibly severe nightmares.     But, when I don't mind having nightmares and find the courage to give them a shot, I find myself preferring Lodger over the other two.  Yeah yeah, unpopular opinion.  I'm no stranger to going against the norm!     The opening song is probably the prettiest and saddest song Bowie ever wrote.  That's one fine little moment of brilliance there.  But then quite possibly my favorite song from the album \\"African Night Flight\\" is next.  I LOVE this song!  The verse melody, the way Bowie sounds drunk and sings \\"ahhhh trapped on islan-in Hawaii\\" over and over (actually that's not what he says at all, in fact I don't think he's actually putting words together there, but when you play the song enough times you begin to think he IS saying something!) and just everything about the extremely strong vocal melody... a classic!     \\"Yassassin\\" rules a lot.  It's like reggae almost, but with extremely catchy vocals.  \\"Red Sails\\" is another really spectacular song.  I like how diverse David Bowie is.  All these experiments work really well on Lodger.     \\"DJ\\" took me YEARS to appreciate, because for a long time I thought it was just a Talking Heads rip-off without any of the charm that makes the Talking Heads so great.  I was wrong though, don't worry.  I love the song now.  \\"Repetition\\" is PROOF that David Bowie has a lot of talent, because not anyone can write a song like this and make it good.  In fact, less than 5% of the musicians out there wouldn't have a clue how to make this song as great as it turned out to be for Mr. Bowie.     The rest of the songs are just really really good.
B00003CXB4|5.0|I was very hesitent to spend 40 bucks but I was desperate and wanted the special addition for my 3 1/2 yr old son for christmas. Best buy ever!!!! The extras that came with it are awesome and he loves all of it. He asks me every day if we can put it in!!!
B00005JOHC|5.0|Myself and my 14 year old son love this show.  We are avid watchers during the week of the repeats as well as the new shows on Monday nights.  The comedy is great regardless of your age, and Charlie Sheen is hilarious.  His sense of humor is fantastic, my 14 year old is so impressed with his style.  Jake the kid on the show is excellent and right on time with his smart mouth and comebacks.  Great show, great set of videos.  I am in the process of buying the next couple of seasons.    Thanks!
B000002O1Q|4.0|The cinematography is beautiful.  The rest is fun and campy in an odd way.  Not exactly a serious story. I liked the music a lot, but it doesn't hold me the way the visuals do after repeated viewings.  Rockers who have never seen it before love it. It is a neat and unusual movie.
0143038419|5.0|This book was a gem! So well written, so enjoyable, thought provoking, laughable that it was hard for me to see it end. I had never read any of this author's works before. After reading this book, I know I will read them all.
1595141979|5.0|I have to say, I'm not a big fan of YA vampire novels, but I've really found a great story here with Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy Series.  I  like Rose's character and given that she's sixteen in the first novel, Vampire Academy, she's a strong heroine to build a series on. I'm still torn between reading a book where a sixteen year old girl's love interest is well into his 20's as it's not something I would approve of even when I was her age, but the coming of age story line, as well as watching her and the rest of the characters mature and find their places in Mead's Vampire world is hard not to enjoy. I would recommend this for readers over sixteen and to read the series in order.  It makes more sense and limits guessing when reading the latest installment.  Shadow Kiss is not only a really good book, but the ending leaves readers eagerly waiting for more.

B001DJ7PR8|3.0|If there is a message to be garnered from the 2008 film, \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona,\\" its that director, Woody Allen, at 72 seems just as confused about life as he did way back in the 70s when he first pondered life and romance in his classics, \\"Annie Hall\\" and \\"Manhattan.\\" Instead of focusing on life from his seasoned vantage point by portraying characters that are a little more chronologically concurrent with his personal experience, Allen resorts to having a cast of relative youngsters--in particular Rebecca Hall as Vicky and Scarlett Johansson as Cristina--voice his quintessential New York angst. No longer his own leading man, he remains the same old Allen, posing the same questions from out of the past as he did as the strange befuddled uber-middle-class-head-scratching thinker paralyzed by the constraints of his identity within the sky-scrapered confines of his beloved metropolis.<br /><br />What has Allen learned about human existence? Plenty, I am sure and not in the sense of a vacuous coffee shop conversation complete with plenty of cigarette smoke and accompanying pseudo sophisticated scowls. Yet in this film set in glorious Antoni Gaudi-studded Barcelona under the ersatz innocuous guise of two American tourists doing the Henry James Europe thing before facing their lifestyle crossroads--settling down to either a staid predictable convention or a reckless feckless bohemia--in terms of theory, he seems to be starting out rather than finishing up which leads me to think that he has revolved along the periphery of his own mindset for far too long. Then again, I doubt that this reflects the truth, as he knows it. Perhaps it's just a case of senior citizen heartburn where old ideas badly digested keep resurfacing like some awful garlic-tasting \\"agita.\\" Allen's own art/life is fraught with fear regarding growing older and dying; his experiences have taught him something--yes? Somehow I think he is too afraid even at 72 to explore them.<br /><br />Not that I don't like this ensemble of wonderfully talented actors set against the dreamy Catalan backdrop. The character of Vicky played by Rebecca Hall (\\"the Prestige\\") strikes me as the most uninspired. With her almost naïve intonations, she sounds and acts like Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow (who both spout Allenesque quips like a Greek chorus), two wonderfully mature actresses portrayed forever bewildered in their prisons of WASP repression by Allen's films. Graduate student, Vicky chooses the safe route as explored by Allen back in the 70s when he started his cinematic quest for self. Secure behind the structure of routine with no surprises, she acquires a husband who makes oodles of money, has already planned his retirement before he has reached the age of 30, researched the best neighborhoods to help him reach middle classed nirvana ASAP and has conditioned himself to believe that his way is the only sensible path to attaining the best that life has to offer. How sad that Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem without his \\"No Country for Old Men\\" air-gun and Dutch boy bob) of the hooded lids and sensually accented English comes along, releases her from the entrapment of stepping outside her safety net and in one weekend destroys her happily-ever-after delusion.<br /><br />Johansson, on the other hand, slides deliciously into Allen's role of blonde muse of the moment as she has now in this, her third Woody Allen film. As wannabe actress Cristina, she barely acts. Her luscious body lazily moves along with the same insouciance that it did in 'Match Point' and 'Scoop.' Yet in spite of the fact that she is portrayed as being comfortable in her own skin, sexually and in terms of her willingness for adventure, she is similar to other Allen heroines as she hangs a little too tightly to a world fraught with manners and reigned-in emotions. When she speaks, she sounds as if she is intoning about a recipe at a garden party rather than big questions that actually mean something to her in the grandscheme of things. Like her creator, she seems a voyeur rather than a participant, unsure of who she is or what her talent is, she examines herself critically and although impulsive in her desire to live a more exciting alternative life from Vicky, her friend, is similarly perplexed and stuck in her own boundaries of unevolved self-identity.<br /><br />Bardem slithers into this role as the Latin Lothario with the same startling authenticity he applies to Anton Chigurh the loathsome Terminator in \\"No Country for Old Men.\\" As the resigned artist Juan Antonio, he sizzles with enough testosterone to equalize nearly all the estrogen emitted by this almost female cast--that is until Penelope Cruz hits the screen as his slightly overly passionate ex-wife (thank God she packs only a pistol and not Chigurh's trademark air-gun). Cruz's wild restlessness perfectly offsets Johansson's voluptuous indolence; she appears in only half of the movie, but quite literally steals the show in a performance that smacks of effortless perfection.<br /><br />Allen begins his film with a shot of the two girls arriving at the Barcelona airport and ends with them departing for America. The experience of the summer now said and done results in a reaffirmation of the same mindset Allen ponders over and over again in all of his films. Life's pleasures and pains are indeed ephemeral, but one's overall sensibilities remain confused no matter what the exposure or how intimate the contact.<br /><br />Bottom Line? In general, \\"Vicky Cristina Barcelona\\" entertains once one gets past director Woody Allen's insistence on revisiting themes that he should develop now as seen from his older vantage point. Utilizing a third person male narrative voice-over, this film seems an innocuous fable about a life changing summer in beautiful Barcelona, but actually comments about Allen's own unwillingness or inability to let go of some of his lifelong phobias. Although Allen's queries are timeless, I would like to see him shed some of his thirty-something-year-old angst and write and direct a film that truly reflects him as artist and a man in the 21st century rather than hide beneath the skin of the young and restless. Let's face it, old and restless is okay, too, and beats the alternative of old and dead. Recommended.

B001KVZ6FC|5.0|Walt Kowalski's view of his new Hmong (Vietnamese) neighbors is the same as Archie Bunker's (of \\"All In The Family') when Blacks move next door to him.  Yet within ninety or so days (one season), Walt is willing to die for them.  And now for the real power of the movie:  The movie is so well done that every inch of progress Walt makes from Bigot to Protector is absolutely believable!    A secondary improbable relationship that develops during the course of the movie/Season is between 78-year-old non-religious Walt and the neighborhood 27-year-old (Catholic) Priest.  When the Priest first introduces himself to Walt at the funeral of Walt's wife, saying that the wife asked him to look after Walt, Walt's reaction is, what advice can I get from a 27-year-old virgin fresh out of Seminary?  Now here is a relationship that would appear dead on arrival.  While Walt and the Priest don't become best friends, Walt improbably does accept the Priest as someone he's willing to associate with. Put succinctly, Walt goes from telling the Priest to \\"Don't call me Walt; call me Mr. Kowalski\\" to \\"Call Me Walt.\\"  And the power of the movie is that not only is the development of this relationship believable but also one can tell the exact moment at which Walt will say to the Priest, \\"Call me Walt.\\"    An excellent question is, \\"What is the significance of the Gran Torino (Walt's prized 1972 car)?\\"  My answer is that is symbolizes a way of life that, while perhaps good in its time, is now outdated and no one particularly misses.  In contrast, had Walt's prized car been a collector's car, for example a Shelby Mustang, then the significance of the car would have been different.
B0015XASFS|3.0|I gave this CD to my husband, a huge Josh Groban fan. Though greatly appreciative, he did not find this CD up to the standards of others he owns. He only listens to one or two tracks.
B001ECQ75A|4.0|My husband and I took my nieces to see this movie in the theater and loved it.  My nephew missed the theater outting, but couldn't wait to watch it after Santa brought him the DVD.    A very entertaining and educational movie...but I'm a Jack Black Fan, which doesn't hurt.  Enjoy!
B0000257BI|5.0|Love this album and anything by Tom Petty. This album came out when I was in high school...found myself with the tune to the song \\"Southern Accents\\" on my mind one day a few weeks ago...just had to find it.
B001GQACGO|1.0|I must say I was very disappointed with this album. The ballads were awful and she didn't need to separate the two disks. Not very eco-friendly! The only good songs are her \\"Sasha Fierce\\" ones. I don't know who she's trying to fool with this whole alter-ego thing. Sasha is Beyonce and Beyonce is Sasha and that's how her fans will always see her. You can't separate the two.
B001DD63UO|5.0|This is one awesome CD. Such a variety of music.  Some feel it is downbeat because of her situation as of late, but what sincere feeling she puts in every song on this CD.  I don't think I ever noticed the beauty of her voice in previous releases.  I think \\"Glitter In The Air\\" is probably my favorite, the keyboard and her voice are like one.  The upbeat tracks get you moving. What a great CD!
B000V6BE6C|2.0|I'm not a die hard Avenged fan, but Waking the Fallen was a solid album with melodic hardcore roots and got quite a few plays from me.  I even warmed up to the 80s inspired sound of City of Evil.  I usually can't stand those guys that always say \\"I like their old stuff\\", but in this case I gotta be that guy.  This self titled effort is like slogging through a swamp of uninspired nu metal.  You can't wait for it to be over.  It comes to a point where the cheesy lyrics and vocals just seem to drone on and on with riffs that simply fall flat.      Maybe they will turn it around with their next album, or better yet they'll ditch the lead singer.  For that reason I can't completely write off this band yet and Almost Easy is a pretty good track.  2 Stars.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|It's nicely organized with good quality disc holders and box. It also comes with an episode book that describes each episode.  It's a great bargain!!
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Baraka is nothing less than a stunningly beautiful film, with some of the most amazing cinematography of people, landscapes, rituals and cities that you're ever likely to see. Watching it, a viewer loses all sense of time and place and is transported to the hauntingly celebratory visions of our incredibly varied planet.    No dialogue or plot needed, just arresting imagery and ethereal music. If you're looking for something new that is an experience in itself, you will be happy to own this film.
B001GZ6QC4|1.0|I know that because of Heath's untimely and highly tragedic (for his young daughter and family) death we all are supposed to be blown away by his Joker and this film in general. Sad to say, I was less than overwhelmed. Anyone who has studied acting knows that you don't play the \\"crazy role\\" at full blast the entire time. It becomes tiresome and overbearing on your audience. Unfortunately, this is exactly what Mr. Ledger did. While his Joker was light years above Nickleson's in terms of being a truly threatening criminal mastermind, I never understood the real reason why he was so determined to enslave Gotham City. Nickleson's Joker had pretty clear cut goals and motives; Ledger's seems to simply be a Loki type character that, while his story began interestingly enough, was not enough to carry a rather mediocre film and never really drew me in. People compared Ledger's Joker to Hannibal Lector, to me this is blasphemy. Lector has so many layers and so much depth that we never even scratch the surface of who he truly is at the core. The Joker never becomes that enigmatic and thus this viewer was never really drawn in or motivated enough to care what happens to the character or how he was created. An abused child? Sorry, that tale, while incredibly sad, is not enough to make me believe that it would transform someone into a being would wants to destroy everything civilized in favour of chaos.    Speaking of unbelievable, the Harvey Dent character was probably the worst offender of this film in that regard. I don't care how much you love someone or how much life sucks because someone deformed you, you're not going to go from being Mr. Moral to threatening the murder of an innocent child whose father didn't even have anything to do with Rachel's death. Why not simply kill the freak who actually did it? Why believe the Joker, the one who you know has caused all of your pain, over someone who tried his best to help save you and your girl? It made no sense.   Lastly, I loved Bale in \\"Batman Begins\\". He is the one and only Batman that I have ever liked or would believe as the character (who was the genius who came up wth the idea of casting Mr. Mom as Batman? Seriously, that was a crime against humanity). Michael Caine, as always, was excellent as Alfred and I really liked Morgan Freeman and his Michael Moore stance on wiretapping, but Bale was not used well here. His voice was beyond ridiculous, and it was pretty obvious that the director only cared about presenting one character in this film. It should had been called \\"The Joker\\", because this film has little to do with Batman. I wasn't thrilled with Maggie, but if Katie Holmes, like Vin Diesil, wishes to wreck her career by bowing out of blockbuster sequels in favour of straight to dvd quality films that no one sees then that's her business.   To close, in my opinion had Heath not died shortly after production this film would never had received the kind of attention and praise that it did. It sounds cruel, but Heath's dying is the only thing that truly had the critics buzzing. No one wishes to speak ill of the dead. To me, this was not the deep psychological ride that everyone made it out to be and I was grossly disappointed. I know that people will write that I'm a twit and can't appreciate the depth of the film, but it simply rang hollow for me. The Joker's challenges were nothing new; there are four \\"Saw\\" films that use the exact same set up to show humanity's inner depravity when push comes to shove. Sorry, I just wasn't thrilled.
B001DELX08|4.0|This was my 1st jump into blu ray opera. I am glad I took the leap. It is like sitting on the 1st row...all the facial expressions including the sweat are right there to see. The singing is very good and for once,Musetta actually looks like Musetta should. A lot cheaper than going to La Scala or the Met.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|What this film comes down to, in terms of whether it will appeal to you or not, is the simple question of which type of spy you prefer: classic Bond (Sean Connery, Moore) or that of Jason Bourne. Personally, I hated the classic Bond films with their portrayal of a spy who can supposedly save the earth but is so flabby and out of shape (not to mention has a drinking problem and smokes too much). I also detested the unbelievable villians and the chicks with genital names. Austin Powers really nailed exactly what the classic Bond films presented as our superspy and how silly it is that anyone would rely on this man.    Now, what about the new Bond? He looks pumped and conditioned, as one would imagine a superspy would be. He is cold and brutal, but with an emotional depth hidden right beneath the surface. Craig is amazing and delivers a fantastic performance (and don't bring up the hair. It's not as if the man were as blond as Flash Gordon, not the hair colour should matter).   The film itself is very fast paced and much more realistic than the early Bond films, with the villians' goals being global terrorism and destabilization of the markets. While not as flashy as taking over the world with a giant laser, it is much more believable. I understand that the early Bonds were closer to the author's original vision, but sometimes, very rarely, scripts are better than the material on which they are based. This is one of those times. To end, if you love the classic Bonds, you most likely will hate this. However, if you under 50 like me and loved the fast pace, kicking major derriere of the Bourne films, you will absolutely love this. Do you want a killer spy or do you want a cheesy pick up artist? The choice is yours.
031606792X|5.0|Of all the books in this series, Breaking Dawn was my most favorite and fun to read....I think it wrapped everything up nicely, yet left the door open for another series of stories with the wonderful characters that Meyer has created.  I recommend this series to all ages.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|ordered the dvd but got a cd. the vendor was sorry for the mix-up and was very helpful with the return. they did not have a dvd available so they quickly refunded both purchase price and shipping. excellent service. in the future i would not hesitate to order from them again.
B00011F5DK|4.0|Gave to my son and his family which includes a 5 yr old and an 8 year old.  We played game many times over Christmas with extended family members from age 5 to 61 years old.  It was a big hit because not only fun and a game that you have to use stragety but every age group was having great fun playing.
6305744793|3.0|Still entertaining, but wish they would have played the original theme since that's what I kept singing to my kids before the movie played.
031606792X|3.0|I don't understand why people hate this book so much. I must admit, I'm not a fan girl, or Twilighter, or anything like that. I got dragged to see the movie, and after watching it, I felt it was a good enough story to spend my money and time to read the books. (PSA: If you're over the age of 20, you'll be laughing at unintentionally funny scenes during the movie. I got glares from several teens sitting around me for that...)    Twilight (the book) was decent. The 2nd and 3rd books, not so much. Awful writing, slow storyline--I found myself skimming paragraphs at a time to get to the next part of the story/plot.     So when I started reading Breaking Dawn, it wasn't without some apprehension. I was afraid I would hate it even more than the 2nd and 3rd books. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find I enjoyed it much more. The story moved along at a good pace, Bella spent less time cooing over Edward's \\"god-like\\" face and form, and reading about her new vampire experiences was rather entertaining. She was also less annoying since she wasn't as helpless and whiny.     I get the feeling some reviewers didn't like this book because the plot didn't progress the way *they* wanted it to progress. Keep in mind, people, this is the author's creation, not yours. Read it for what it is and enjoy the story rather than hating how everything turned out. So you want Bella to be an evil vampire rather than good? Go write your own sequel. Obtain the permissions and write your own version of Bella's experiences and struggles as a newborn vamp.     The only disappointment was the ending. I'll not give it away, but the ending was so...cheesy. There's no other way to describe it. Well, sickening is another apt adjective. (And now the flamers will tell me to go write my own ending. Touche.)    And finally, sorry Ms. Meyer, but you're no JK Rowling. The HP series are books I read over and over again; they're well written, the plot moves right along, and I don't get distracted by grammatical or other mistakes, and I delightedly discover (or remember) a new detail that I missed in earlier readings.     So, in conclusion, a good read. Not something I'd read over and over, and I slightly regret buying the book, but it's a good read if you don't want to think too much about anything. Borrow it from a friend or library.

B0016HNOXQ|4.0|Third is a journey with Portishead through some new uncharted territory. It leaves you feeling like you've learned something. Beth Gibbon's incomparable vocals are the meat of the entree, but there are so many flavors throughout the collage of this feast. If you like Portishead's previous albums you're probably gonna really like this one!

B001GKJ2DO|1.0|I grew up with ABBA through high school and they have always been a guilty pleasure so I was really looking forward to this movie. (I haven't had a chance to see the play.) What a disappointment. The singing was terrible (with the exception of the daughter) and the acting just as bad. I haven't seen a musical this embarrassing since \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" (which at least had decent singing but was still so bad it managed to effectively kill the careers of both the Bee Gees and Peter Frampton).

1416562605|4.0|I would suggest that if one is even faintly familiar with Indian culture, one's understanding and enjoyment of White Tiger is enhanced.  Were I unfamiliar with the culture, I would have enjoyed the book, but with less comprehension of the circumstances of it.  Similar to the movie Slumdog Millionaire.  A great story, but much better if one has experienced big-city India.
0375703861|5.0|Blending numerous unique and eclectic characters into British late-20th century society, the author creates a whirlwind finale where the different people with different perspectives appear to all agree or disagree for reasons to which none of the others can condone.<br /><br />Half Jewish/half-not-Jewish Joshua Chalfen seems an oddity - but he is actually the most normal of the most normal British. His peers include 3/8th's Jamaican black and 5/8th-not, Irie Jones, whose mother leaves the JW teachings in her teens to fall into the arms of Archie Jones, a simple man who is decades her senior, and someone much less tall. Archie's WW II buddy Samad Iqbal marries someone of his color and nation and age, and fathers a child (actually twins) almost simultaneously with best friend Archie.<br /><br />We then fast forward to the children being teenagers, and how they conflict with their parents who are anything but Ozzie and Harriet - or the British equivalent of the same. In turn, everything basically does not come out as planned.  Each person's life ends up more twisted and F%$#ed (an often used term in the book) up than anyone could or did envision.<br /><br />But, resounding above the great characteratures of these people is the dialogue. Rich and diverse. Jamaican patois of Hortense Bowden (grandmother to Irie) and her daughter Clara contrast beautifully to Archie's middle class simplicity and the Bengali wit of Samad and Samad's wife, Alana. Mixing the Bengali dialect of Samad and his often stilted use of the English language with the British bred good-for-nothing son, Millar,  and Bengal-raised Magi. Samad kidnaps Maid as a preteen and sends him to Bengal to prohibit him from being polluted by western weaknesses (as well as his pimping brother) and bestow upon him the fundamental and righteous Muslim ways, Samad's experiment fails. He learns, \\"No one is more British than the Indians. And, no one is more Indian and the British.\\"<br /><br />It is another experiment which is the focus of the last half of the book.  Joshua, whose parents would make any teenager cringe, have a father making the super mouse called \\"Future mouse\\" - something perhaps greater than Mickey Mouse.  Plugged with scientific engineering, the mouse has a life span of ten years, unheard of for rodents. Touching upon God's work infuriates many: Clara's JW mother Hortense, the Muslims of Millar (Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation (or KEVIN)), the Muslim Samad, and hippies Joely and Crispin (Eco-terrorist-like radicals). Their respective reactions are not as funny as one may desire.<br /><br />The beginning and end of the book deliver a mixture of humor not dissimilar to the characters - instead of mixing black with white, the beginning and end mix macabre with humor. Death, to this reader, is not a topic of humor. My prejudice welcomes such attempts as heartily as a comedy about the holocaust.  But, at times it can work. \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" and the \\"[[ASIN:0786868805 Producers, The]]\\" succeeded, and so does this novel.<br /><br />In between the bizarre story lies great introspective observation by the author.  With witticisms that even Archie's and Samad's bartender could not bestow, she describes many of the characters' actions in a hip-but-insightful manner. These \\"extras\\" made the novel much more than a story told by a narrator.  These additions made the book a novel of merit - something  which many other reviewers have agreed exists.<br /><br />If you can leap past personal prejudices - something I had to do - and allow the book to proceed, you will be pleased to have made the effort.f of the book.  Joshua, whose parents would make any teenager cringe, have a father making the super mouse called \\"Future mouse\\" - something perhaps greater than Mickey Mouse.

Touching upon God's work infuriates many: Clara's JW mother Hortense, the Muslims of Millar (Keepers of the Eternal and Victorious Islamic Nation (or KEVIN)), the Muslim Samad, and hippies Joely and Crispin (Eco-terrorist-like radicals). Their respective reactions are not as funny as one may desire.    The beginning and end of the book deliver a mixture of humor not dissimilar to the characters - instead of mixing black with white, the beginning and end mix macabre with humor. Death, to this reader, is not a topic of humor. My prejudice welcomes such attempts as heartily as a comedy about the holocaust.  But, at times it can work. \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" and the \\"[[ASIN:0786868805 Producers, The]]\\" succeeded, and so does this novel.    In between the bizarre story lies great introspective observation by the author.  With witticisms that even Archie's and Samad's bartender could not bestow, she describes many of the characters' actions in a hip-but-insightful manner. These \\"extras\\" made the novel much more than a story told by a narrator.  These additions made the book a novel of merit - something  which many other reviewers have agreed exists.    If you can leap past personal prejudices - something I had to do - and allow the book to proceed, you will be pleased to have made the effort.
0956010903|5.0|This is a beautifully made collector's edition of 'The Tales of Beedle the Bard' and I highly recommend it to dedicated Harry Potter fans.  The price is a bit steep but I think most would find that it is well worth it.
0439882826|5.0|This is an awesome pop up book and a must have for Star Wars fans. Each page has its own mini pop ups. I bought 2 of these for gifts and the little boys loved them! [so did I!]
B00127RAJY|3.0|Great great workout for beginners to intermediates. If you don't have a problem with being motivated, this is a great workout dvd. For me, though, the music is boring and Jillian has no perosnality. Turbo Jam is more my thing. With 30 day shred I can't wait for it to be over. With TJ, I go twice as long, burn more calories, and have way more fun.
B00005JPSM|5.0|For anyone who wants to watch a movie that is funny and still retains a real plot that isn't stupid- I recommend this movie.  It will make you laugh and root for the characters as they grow throughout the movie.  So if you are having a terrible day or are just stressed out, put this movie in and relax for the rest of the evening (or morning)!

B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I dont have to tell you how great this movie is, but it arrived on time and i was satisfied
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|It's a really great movie.  The greatest performance Heath Ledger do.  Regretfully, he died.  The only thing that I don't like and is the same thing that I don't like in the originals, is that the villans in Batman always ends in Arkham or prison, not dead.  In the originals, The Joker, The Pinguin, \\"Catwoman\\" (maybe) and Harvey Two Faces, all of them died.  In Batman Return Raz Al Ghul and now again, Harvey Two Faces, died.  That's is the only thing that I don't like.
0783225482|5.0|I know of many people who have watched this movie over and over...  It's one that you almost never get tired of.  Bruce Willis is so great as the \\"naive but brilliant guy\\" and this movie definitely shows how far Hollyweird women will go to \\"look young forever\\".   Highly recommended... Very funny, and almost believable as real life !!!
