1401941893|4.0|I read this book with my nine-year-old niece. It's really something that I think will mostly benefit a tween/early teenage girl audience. For what it is, the book is pretty cool: a famous supermodel giving her take on life lessons, self-esteem, etc. Yes, the writing itself is a bit repetitive and fluffy, but then again, I think it's perfect for a super young audience. If Miranda Kerr's goal was to reach women ages 20+, she failed miserably. However, I think younger girls will enjoy this and benefit from the author's positive messages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Well...now I know what all the hype is about! What an amazing story! I can't even begin to describe all the emotions this one pulled out of me! Hats off to you Collen. 5 stars. Simply wonderful!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Not a hard game. Only 10 levels though. Would like to see morr levels and increasing difficulty in future releases. Overall fun but very easy.
B00CW665VI|4.0|Ha! Drew is seriously awesome! This book was such an adorable read...definitely refreshing after some books full of pure mind bending craziness that I've been reading. I loved Kate's character, even when she was being silly with her musician boyfriend, I loved The Bitch and her daughter to death but most of all Drew was just witty and charming in his own way and it was really fun to be in his head. I had heard great things about this book for a few weeks and it definitely did not disappoint, I will be sure to recommend this to people when they are looking for something funny, sexy and sweet!
0525478817|5.0|I was not really sure about the book at first...but then instead of just looking at the cover, I actually read the book and fell in love. This book has everything tied in a perfect bundle. It has some mystery, humor, sadness, adventure, and romance. It is by far my favorite book of all time. Oh and a note to people who actually decide to read this, you will NOT be disappointed.This is a book that you will read, without a doubt, more than once. Thank You and have a nice morning/afternoon/day/evening! :)
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This is the second time I chose to pick up a Colleen Hoover story at the beginning of a work day and didn't put it down unless I was absolutely forced to do so. Colleen has this ability to get you so invested in the story she is telling that you don't want to...no...that you can't put it down. The feelings that this book ripped out of my chest were all very real and very raw. The tears that ran down my face weren't only because of what the characters were going through but also Colleen has a way of making you think, what if I was the one enduring this? I'm glad I finally bumped this up on my TBR list. It was beautiful. In a way I am extremely thankful that I waited so now I can read the next two books right away. Thank you for a beautiful story Colleen <3
B00C7DGRL4|4.0|For an action adventure it is fun and new.  It doesn't have much of a story or plot, but it definitely holds your interested as you move through the movie.  I would recommend for the one night movie rental.
1434440826|5.0|Definitely a must read....it literally can change your life. Read it. Then read it again. Simple concept - if you apply it.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Ok game that keeps you guessing.  Makes you wonder if your hiding spots in your house are good enough.  Lol
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|game loaded twice and then had error and I had to uninstall it.  game demanded I be signed in to amazon app store before it would run
B0034G4ORC|5.0|outstanding FX and CGI...good acting with some humor and kick ass stunts was surprised we were dominated so thoroughly yet this squad somehow saved the day
B005721Y7Y|5.0|I absolutely adore this movie. Kevin Spacey is wonderful in it and I love the plot. It is the story of life, and struggling through it. Love, lust, pain, secrecy, and anger. Truly a beautiful film.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I make a point to play this whenever I have a few minutes of extra time.  I find it very relaxing.
B007REV4T8|5.0|I have all the James Bond movies and really enjoy how far they have come.  This one explaines a litte bit of why James is the way he is.  When the main character is fleshed out and more of his history is exposed the better the story.  A must have for the true 007 fan.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|Love this trilogy, and these two are really well paired. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are really comfortable together and it makes for an excellent story.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|My son has gotten used to having white noise every night to get to sleep.  He usually uses a fan to sleep at night but we were taking an airplane trip and just could not bring the fan on an upcoming vacation.  I downloaded this app and it worked like a charm.  My son slept well and said it was just like being at home.
B0088XXCZ6|5.0|Saw her on tour after this came out. I love her vocals, her choices, and after a few listens, this earns its place in her canon.

B0091REZMW|4.0|its challenging, but sometimes too challenging for people who wear glasses. sometimes you really can't see some of those things. even still, its worth the download.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Story is awesome, special effects/magic were not overwhelming. If you're a hopeless romantic, go watch this one.<br />I love robert de niro playing a gay pirate!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun Game. Needs a lot more levels to solve. I Recommend for any one who likes these type of games.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|Great.  Went to the office sleepy.  Couldn't put it down. Only wish it was longer.  Hope there is more of Maxwell and King.
0596007124|4.0|When I started to read this book, I understood basic concepts of design patterns easily. Because it is  important to understand the concepts I recommend this book.
B00A77II0U|5.0|My 6 year old granddaughter showed me the game. I'm hooked! It's great for us seniors. Love searching for clues and items.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. Very addicting! I'm glad I found it searching through the app store. Fun !
B00C6XBESQ|5.0|my favorite artist  i have to hide  the cd  so i dont overplay it  as  was her first  buy it
B00CATSONE|5.0|An excellent book on Nikola Tesla, a true creative genius.  Well-written and thought provoking.  I highly recommend this summary of the man who invented the twentieth century but got little of the credit or reward.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun and relaxing. Just take your time. No need to buy diamonds. Rotate between games. Make friends. Gather your facebook friends.
0743454537|5.0|I picked up this book out of curiosity, dimly aware (from seeing the movie trailer) that it was about the difficult subject of a family's long, desperate struggle against childhood cancer. Starting somewhere in the middle, I immediately found it too compelling to put down except for work and sleep. The narration takes turns. Each family member, and others closely involved, serve as sequential narrators. The author has allowed the reader to understand each character deeply. I could not help but feel a great deal of empathy for each of them. The story has the linearity of a courtroom drama, punctuated by a few flashbacks. The surprising conclusion blew me away. I have not felt this sad since 9-11.<br /><br />I will read it again, but like people long into mourning it is time to extricate myself and resume daily life. I've raised a healthy daughter to maturity and had little reason to identify with the struggle depicted here; inexplicably the story drew me in and did not let go. The book is \\"marketed\\" as a women's novel and I'm a guy boomer. My Sister's Keeper is a beautiful coming-of-age story full of hope and determination.  Anybody who seeks to understand others should read this book.<br /><br />Steve in Austin
B0071XO8RA|5.0|With nearly 6k reviews,  I'm not going to be able to bring anything new to the table....but I really wanted to express my appreciation for this story.  I love the characters and I'm really looking forward to reading more!
B00BTHV05M|5.0|This is So good!!! New to listening to One Republic and the album didn't disappoint. I would definitely recommend this album.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|It's Halo in live action so that's awesome by itself. It also had some pretty good acting and visual effects, considering the budget.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I found this game difficult to manipulate.  When I did get it to work I found it boring.  Each level is like previous level.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This book captured me right from the beginning. Cheryl Strayed is a very gifted writer and an inspirational and courageous woman.
B004EBT5CU|4.0|Great,soulful,powerful, The guys and the girls all find something to enjoy with this singers abilities .You will certainly enjoy this album.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It was fun to read a story like this from an uninhibited five year old boy. It took some getting used to in the beginning however. The scenes are laid out well and the author makes you feel like you are in the Room. The climax comes rather quickly and some of what happens afterward, I thought, was out of character for two of the characters. Overall, the story is tied up well.
0425170349|5.0|Tom Clancy's attention to detail and smooth flowing stories are pretty exciting and hard to put down,I usually stay attached to one till I finish or fall asleep.
1439156816|5.0|I am an aspiring writer myself and found this book engaging, wonderful and amazingly helpful. King provides you a writing &#34;toolbox&#34; with which to draw from when crafting your own tales. This is far from any of his other work. I am not a huge Stephen King fan, but you can't deny his obvious talent. A must read!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this is the most awesome app ever I am addicted to it I love it. anybody who likes dinosaurs or strategy games should buy it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show.  Spot on from what I can tell of clothing and history for the time period.  I hope it will go on for a long time.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|Graphics are a 5.  Unresponsive controls ruin it though and load times are poor.  Could have been a decent freemium game.  note2 on lte.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|it's not bad. it passes the time, when i need to do some short wasting of time. helps to ease sitting in Dr's offices and staring at walls.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|I feel like anything I write will not give this movie justice. My review's title says it all, it made the list of my all time favorite movies. I can't believe anyone would rate this any lower than 5 stars, and I can't believe I haven't heard of this movie before! As far as what it's about, you can read in the summary of the movie, I'm here to tell you if it delivered, and, boy, it did! The movie has everything in it: action, inspiration, emotion, and even mild comical relief. It is just amazing! Watch it and you won't be disappointed.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|Always at my fingertips. Easy to use and understand. It's free and seems to be up to date. love it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|i really like ww2 weapons so this app is ment for me by combining revolutionary firearms arms technology is absolutely genius
B00138KJY0|5.0|What can I say. It's Michael Jackson and this is a wonderful CD. Amazon was selling the MP3 version of the CD for a song (pun intended) so I had to have it. It's definatley part of my songs rotation for my iPod
B001NHNG64|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, it keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Even the FUN has bad apples, does Tagalog surprise anyone?  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys mysteries and seeing an ex military man at his best.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just the right amount of challenge to keep an adult interested and wanting to make it through to the end.
B0038P80CO|5.0|I had no doubt about giving this film 5 stars.  The story is phenomenal! The acting flawless.  The special effects outstanding. A+ all around.  You cannot imagine the ending until you are there!
B00338QENI|4.0|This was yet another book that I'd been hearing about forever and actually had on my \\"to read\\" list for awhile before finally being forced to pick it up for Book Club. I remember going to Amazon multiple times to read the plot summary and deciding not to buy it. I don't think I ever really understood what the book was about and all the science talk went over my head. I also don't think it sunk in that it was a true story, although I'm sure someone told me it was or I read it on Amazon at some point. So, my big lesson is that if a book's plot summary sounds awful, but it's still extraordinarily popular, there is probably a reason and I should just give it a try!<br /><br />The Prologue does a fantastic job setting up this story and making boring science interesting - maybe Amazon should have just printed the Prologue as their plot summary!<br /><br />I loved the way Skloot structured the story - she wrote about the HeLa cells and the Lacks family in the context of her own journey researching the book. So, she is the narrator and ends up being an actual character. Taking this approach added so much to the story and some of the funniest and most moving moments come from Skloot's interactions with Henrietta's family.<br /><br />Deborah (Henrietta's daughter) is a fantastic character - she's somewhat crazy, but I felt for her and her whole family. They are funny, poignant, and troubled. They are uneducated and completely confused and overwhelmed by what has become of their mother's cells. They, for the most part, have a thirst for information about HeLa and a childlike glee every time they learn something new. They are also incredibly angry and bitter at times and don't know who to trust.<br /><br />I also learned so much about medical research and practices in the 1950′s and 1960′s, medical ethics debates (particularly about informed consent), and treatment of blacks in hospitals in the time of Jim Crow. This book completely surprised me and was a great mix of storytelling and learning. It's also a great Book Club selection.<br /><br />For more reviews, check out my blog, Sarah's Book Shelves.telling and learning.

B0081J95TE|5.0|Most times during a musical career, a band loses its focus for whatever reason on the things that made it a top selling band.  This album is Garbage refocused and discovering again why they love creating music.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading about some ideas that are just not talked about or endorsed in the American Culture. The idea of a happy and calm life for both parents and child(ren) is extremely appealing to all; yet the way the French achieve that may not be appealing to every family and at the same time opens ones eyes to a mind set or attitude that may just be worth learning and practicing.
B00C5WR6JE|1.0|As a big fan of Bill Frisell I had pretty high expectations for this album.  After a few listens I just can't get into it.  I guess I must be too stupid to understand the greatness of this music.  It isn't jazz, it isn't catchy Americana tunes, it isn't anything that sticks.  The musicianship is quite impressive, but I just can't get into very many of these songs.  I was hoping for a more impressive songwriting effort - come on, with an album title like &#34;Big Sur&#34;, you really expect something bigger, and I just don't see this here.  Go listen to John Scofield or Marc Ribot or Pat Metheny's latest efforts instead if you want some cool guitars. Frisell is capable of much much more.  *** (over 1 year later)  I still stand by the above review.   I just can't get into this album somehow, even though I really wanted to.    That being said, I went to see Frisell and the Big Sur Quintet live in concert and the concert blew us all away.  They performed the music of Woody Guthrie (different stuff than what's on this CD here).   THAT was an amazing concert.   THAT was an amazing band.   I want to see this live again.  And I want to see a CD release of this concert.   I would rate it 5 stars without hesitation.   Very uplifting!
159463176X|5.0|It is hard to book-talk this book because it has so many characters and so many stories. All are engaging. The writing is beautiful, as are the author's two other books. I will read it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|\\"I want you to keep them open...because I need you to watch me give you the very last piece of my heart.\\"<br /><br />With a compelling storyline that captured my attention and never let go, Hopeless is undoubtedly one of the best written books I have ever read.<br /><br />You know how after reading a certain kind of book, you have to follow it up with \\"that\\" book? If just can't be any book? Well, I had just finished reading Jane's Melody and found myself in this very predicament. Ironically, many other readers seemed to share this same feeling. I didn't need a similar storyline, but I needed the writing to be \\"just perfect\\" and the emotions to be \\"just right.\\"<br /><br />After scrolling through the 400+ books on my Kindle Paperwhite, as well as the the numerous review requests that have come into the blog, I still could not decide what I wanted to read. Finally, Yesi (a fellow blogger, friend, and co-admin of an online book club) asked me (once again) to read Hopeless by Colleen Hoover. This was actually one of our book club reads in January, and I just didn't have the time to read it, nor did I make it a priority because I preferred a lot of steam in my books. (Plus, I tend to get \\"weirded out\\" when the male characters are close to my daughter's age of 17. I don't want to be accused of being a cougar, plus it's just...well, you know.) Anyhow, since my dear friend Yesi has always read what I've asked her to read and we share the exact same taste in books, I decided to read this one for her. :) All I can say is, \\"Why the hell did I wait so long?\\" (I can just hear Yesi saying, \\"I told you!\\")<br /><br />I absolutely adored the characters of Sky Davis and Dean Holder, who were wise beyond their years and proved that true love does conquer all. There is one scene where Holder asks Sky to take away his pain! Holy toledo batman! That was the sexiest non-graphic sex scene I have ever, ever read! Unreal. :)<br /><br />And please, don't misunderstand me here. I know who Colleen Hoover is and have \\"pimped\\" her out numerous times myself on our blogs. I even met her last year at the Decatur Book Festival, where she talked to my daughter and I about her book Slammed . I bought the paperbacks of Slammed and Point of Retreat for my daughter but chose not to read them because I like my \\"steam\\" and wasn't interested in reading about high school students (when I already lived with some). Well, as you can imagine, I will undoubtedly be reading these two books and probably anything else she writes.<br /><br />My daughter has been on a mission trip since Saturday, and I cannot wait until she gets home because I have the perfect book waiting for her, and it's called Hopeless.<br /><br />Now, on to Losing Hope, which by the sounds of it, I'll need to stock up on my Hershey Kisses with Almonds. (Maybe I should start including my own rating system when it comes to the angst and tears = 2 bags of Hershey Kisses with Almonds.)<br /><br />So what have you learned from my post? If Hopeless is on your TBR list, don't delay-move that baby to the very top! If it's not on on your list, click that GR button below and put it there. Yes, I think I have a new GirlCrush.

0393345408|4.0|Positive: Very well written analysis of emerging countries. Excellent insight into the economic/political interface impacting growth.<br />Negatives: (1) Selectiven and inconsistent  measures of strenghts and weaknesses of the countries reviewed. (2) Overly biased in favor of some countries' strengths (e.g., overstaing India's strengths and undersating its weaknesses). (3) Lack of insights into game-changing events (e.g., disruptive technologies, energy developments, robotics, etc,) that can alter or impact future growth.
B00004XPPK|5.0|I just love these old movies.  I recently saw this on TCM and thoroughly enjoyed it.  I'll have to find time to watch it again
B009UNGYHG|5.0|I had a Moto elite silver that had this arrangement of a spare battery charging case and loved it but that unit was horrible. The legend is great and this accessory makes it even better. if you travel a lot and don't want to have to worry about one more thing to charge then this is for you. I can go on a 2-3 day business trip and only use this charging case to keep the unit going. Plus it keeps it safe from harm when not in use!!! Almost like the protection is a bonus.

B004J64QR4|5.0|This is a great production of Les Miserales.  Far better than the film version that came out this year.  Alfie Boe may be the best Valjean yet.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Liked the previous version. It is now harder to move from locations. The maps are not necessary to find the  weather conditions for known locations.

B00CDT41RY|4.0|I'm a big QT fan and I liked this film a lot, but I have to say it's pretty much Inglorious Bastards with the bad guys in different suits. that said, I found the performances of Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio very satisfying. I love QT's homage to Blazing Saddles with the KKK raid scene. It's an altogether funny movie. IMHO Inglorious Bastards was a better film, though.
B00821PCJS|3.0|I think this series has a lot of potential. The writing and acting was a bit lacking, but the story was ok.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Saw her in concerts performing some of her work from this album and Part two. I recommend this to any Badu fan.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|This movie is just a fun shoot em up flick. Brought back all those 80 action stars. If you're expecting more than a high body count and cheesy one liners, then this is not your movie.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|This series covers the The War of the Roses from the different perspectives in each book. Having read the White Queen first, I was impressed at how well the author was able to show the events unfolding with a completely different interpretation. The writing is vivid and transports you to that time period and gives an idea of the issues facing female nobility- being part of powerful families with no apparent power themselves.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This season was good and very sad. I enjoyed it very much.<br />I would encourage any one to collect the set of movies for there collection.
0812983459|5.0|I really liked this one!  It kept my attention the whole way through and it reminded me of [[ASIN:B004WB19E4 The Year of the Hare: A Novel]] by Arto Paasilinna.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|At times it was difficult to follow and confusing even though the various threadlines became cohesive.<br /><br />A good read but not up to his first two books
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I can't believe I just read this in one sitting!  Albom's story of Father Time is magical, thought provoking and, as always, a perfect read for a weary soul.  You have to take some time and enjoy this latest addition of his works.  Bravo!  Encore!  I can't wait for the next!
B001HADE00|5.0|Great Album then! Great CD now! This cd brings back so many good memories, the 80's were a great time.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|this game is great!!!I love all the horses and outfits you can choose from the only problem I have with it is that it takes a while to make a lot of money.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I figured this would be a light, romantic read, but I didn't expect the emotions I got from the dialogue. The story was a bit predictable and drawn out, but at the same time it wasn't. I found myself thinking \\"Make up your minds!\\" more than once, in a good way. I also like that the book gives multiple points-of-view from the characters.<br /> Megan is an independent woman who is tired of dealing with men and the hurt they can cause. She decides to take matters into her own hands and have a baby herself. She just needs the right guy to provide the good stuff. But right now, she must deal with going to Vegas for her cousin's wedding.<br /> Connor is a controlling businessman who is used to getting what he wants. He and a few of his buddies decide to take a trip to Vegas. Connor and Megan had  rough childhoods, resulting in both of them having trouble in their romantic relationships<br /> After drinking way to much, Megan and Connor wake up together the next morning. She can't remember a thing, but he remembers everything. Megan wants a divorce, knowing that this isn't part of her plan. Connor remembers what they talked about the night before, and he just can't let her go. He wants to give the marriage a try. Megan isn't so sure. So, they decide on a trial period. After that, she is free to go if she wants to.<br /> Connor spends the next few weeks trying to show her how great they are together. Megan tries to get him to see the things that may not be so great about the relationship, like him coming home to find her wearing a stinky face mask. After a while, it gets to be too much for her, so she heads back home. Connor doesn't want to give her up that easily.<br /> In the end he learns not to be so controlling and I have to admit that he pissed me off a few times. It was also hard to stay mad at him when he was doing it in a caring way just trying to get her to see that the marriage could work. Megan learns how to open up and allow him to be a part of her life and that not all men make promises that they don't keep.<br /> The ending itself was really sweet. I would say more about why, but I don't want to give it away. So, this is your typical Vegas wedding story, with a twist. I think it is something a bit different and refreshing.<br /><br /> I received this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This is a great movie.  I really enjoyed it a lot.  I really can't wait for the next Avengers movie.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy playing this to waste time. I love horses and while no video game can be completely accurate this one provides a glimpse into the care involved in owning one.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|While watching this series I just couldn't get enough.  I loved watching the interactions of the families, as well as the servants, and how they all took such pride in their positions.  It is nice to see people treating each other with such respect, which so many times in modern day you do not see.  I love the costumes, the scenery, the story, everything about it is just pure enjoyment.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game you run with a minion from dispicabal me<br />Buy upgrades with bananas that you collect in the missions that you go on
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love this book!!! It's action packed, and keeps you flipping to see what happens next!! It really is the best book in the series!!!!
B00AG475K8|5.0|I've always been a fan of eric stoltz. its so great to see him in his prime in the 80s playing a heart throb and teenager. i like the story and also like the whole 80s feeling of it all. take me back in time.
B002SGYPS2|5.0|I really like this movie, but I am only writing in this box because they say I have to in order to rate it.
B001D0BLTA|5.0|one of my favorite movies ever! it actually inspires me on so many levels, and has the perfect 80s feel.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like this app as it is accurate and fast to get the info when wanted not having to wait for the download that takes forevet.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I love this movie,. its got heart and a great storyline to follow and shares a deeper connection of overcoming circumstance and finding ourselves truly. a wacky tale of a girl with the face of a pig who against odds finds true love and appreciating herself for who she is.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|In 43 years I have never read anything like this.  I know nothing about gaming or computers but this narrative stands in its own and creates the fascination.
B008220BLG|5.0|I absolutely love this film. I love how it takes you through the perspective of a boy trapped in a zombie body. i found it humorous sad and dark in a good way. i love the ending and how everything turns out. i was surprised by how much i like this movie.
B00957T6X6|3.0|I was surprised at the ending it left too much out to really be the end.  I sincerely hope this author will write a better ending for this story
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|i really enjoy this film. i love the ideas and especially the role Claire danes plays as a fallen star. its a great adventure full of great odyssey.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|New version not as good as the old one. Needs more steps for info.<br />Wish I was given a choice to change format or not.
B001BR5NN0|5.0|love the scenario of this whole movie. and soundtrack is amazing too. cant go wrong with this classic. 80s well done
B005SFR7YE|5.0|This cast is better than the two different casts I saw on Broadway, and the extra tribute at the end makes this really special.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I love this movie!! I finally own it!! and am so grateful! it makes me laugh and cry and feel every emotion through this journey they take you on of these women's lives. I love the humor and drama of the movie. very entertaining.
B00AR83PN4|1.0|terrible graphics and half the time it doesn't respond. Glad I didn't pay for it and I'm hoping to delete it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This really puts a good edge on my pocket knives.<br /><br />What I like best is the ceramic sharpener—it uses ceramic wedges instead of rods. What  difference. It's worth it just for that.<br />It was also reasonably priced.<br /><br />I will buy another with my next Amazon order.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|This was so bad it's hard to even describe.  Imagine 90 minutes of continuously firing automatic weapons, random insertion of former action heroes, no story, and incredibly bad acting.  Glad it was free on Amazon.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|All around perfect book! Yet another one of Nicohlas Spark's books that made me wish there was more to read
B0081336FO|5.0|Great great show great great cast! Hope they're planing a next season, of Sherlock for all the fans such as myself
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun! I can't  believe it's free!!! I'm 24 and my daughter (4) likes it too. Fun for all ages.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun and hilarious game for those who want to have a great time. Graphics are good a d the game mechanics too besides Minions are really funny!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Another exciting read from Preston and Child.  Horror, action and deduction all wrapped in the most personal case of Agent Pendergast's career.  Not as consistent as the Diogenes Trilogy but this last book provides a rip roaring conclusion!  Can't wait to see what's next for Agent Pendergast.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome...I like when I do a mission... and if I have a hard time on passing that mission then I can skip it... and it's really cool when it picks up the speed...
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The whole game is fun. I saw my friend play it on her Samsung tablet (Kindles  are way better). It looked really fun. So I saw the game and it was free and I was like yay! Then I watched the video. It took a long time for it to load,so I waited. Then I realized it was FROZEN!!! I had to shut my Kindle down. I'm scared of trying to play the game again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is like temple run but in despicable me 2! If you like the movie you will like this promise  I HOPE YOU WILL GET IT
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I love movies about comic book fiction. This one gets my highest rating because of its entertainment value as compared to other movies of the same style.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I'm sooooo hooked on Patrick Jane. He can be a total ass but he is also amazing. Love the series. When I'm done with season 3, I will be looking for #4.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|play it its i grrrrrrrrrrrrrrreeeeaaaat.you will have fun. i hate the game it is soo boring i dont want to do this. this is dumb
B000QRIGLC|4.0|This guy tells an amazing story!  One lucky guy for sure.  Amazed how during the big attack, his rifle never left his side.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a fun game app.  My husband and 5 yo son both love it, and so do I.  A great t one waster, though, too.  If only they did not tout the Facebook link so much.  I am on FB, but don't use it to promote games that I play.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|This app doesn't load the whole Facebook page as others do. Perhaps I'm expecting too much for a mobile app, but I know what I want and this ain't it!
B009JBZH54|5.0|One of the best movies ever! Comes with a great artbook and extras disc but only the movies would be enough to this box. A must have item to the fans.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|...and there is something to be said for that. I find I must open it from a hot link in another app (e.g. mail) since there is no storage in my Kindle. I need to get used to that.
B004K58GSO|5.0|My husband really loves Westerns, especially the classics, and this just fit the bill! He enjoyed every minute of it!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I don't really use it because my Kindle Fire provides its own email reader that check all my accounts, but it does work.
0060723513|5.0|I highly recommend this book. !~ I bought it several times over and have given it to friends and family. Her journey, a true story, is by far one of the most courageous I have read to date. And anyone who reads it will take away this sense of &#34;there is nothing we are not capable of accomplishing or surviving&#34;.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I wanted to like this novel because I like other works by this author.  But, it was not compelling.  When I stopped reading, I did not have that &#34;can't wait to get back to the book&#34; feeling.  Part of this is because the characters were very confusing.
B008133MDK|5.0|It was a season just as good as the first season. I really hate the way it ended with no closure. I guess it will resume later starting from his plunge.( don't want to give it away to other watchers) I will be monitoring future seasons because I really enjoyed the show..
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Quite a ride. Like the author, who is new to me.  A bit verbose at times, but very good book
B00499QUK2|5.0|The show kept me in suspense, he (Sherlock) continued to have me on edge playing with life and death. I loved his observation skills and how he read individual people. I especially loved his competitive nature with his adversely.
B0000549B0|5.0|There is no acting like the old actors.  This storey is so much fun.  We use it at Easter and Halloween.<br />Good for the whole family.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Music is a big part of my life, though I am not a critic.  I listened to In Your Dreams again, this early summer morning in Wisconsin USA. Some songs reach my heart more than others, because of my past experience with chronic illness.  I tend more towards ballads and quiet songs these days.  Yet the album does work well as a whole, and I am listening to the songs in sequence too.<br /><br />If art is about \\"the human condition,\\" and finding consolation, hope, and strength to go on - and be creative in new ways - this album expresses so much beauty and resilience.  Recovery can take some time.<br /><br />I've been listening to Fleetwood Mac since the 1970s, and all of Stevie's solo albums as well.<br /><br />Stevie Nicks is a true poet.  She is able to write from a deep place in her soul and then give her songs to everyone else. I am very grateful for her presence in my life.  Thanks to all who work on her albums and website as well, and add so much.<br /><br />I highly recommend In Your Dreams.<br /><br />Ellen Grace Olinger, Ed.D
B000ATQYT2|5.0|And as always, the storey is a great one and fun for the kids.  Kids of all ages can enjoy this one.
B007Z8ZKS2|3.0|Strength shown by these kids is phenomenal.! and i too wish the treatments he has shown in the book may actually be true!! Gus is guy you fall in love with. His wittiness and his attitude towards life is very inspiring!
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|Its been a month since I've watched this movie but it still plays in my mind. There are parts that are sleepers but for the most part it keeps you wondering &#34;where is this going?&#34;.  Without causing a spoiler alert, I will say the Asian lady and her story left me with vivid dreams after watching the movie and when I stop and think about it now, I'm still stunned at how the entire movie played out. If you like thought provoking movies, this is definitely a good one for it!!
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I love Man of Steel and thought this is a fantastic reboot of Superman. Needless to say I love Cavill as Superman. Reeve's portrayal was too goofy, cheesy, corny and sweet which may be what the 1970s want. Nowadays the tougher audience deserves a true Man of Steel and Cavill's portrayal as an alien demi-god who is not 100% perfect yet fits the bill. No saving kittens from tree tops for little girl, thank god! I also enjoy the plot even if the last battle scene is a tad long. But all the devastations that the haters complain about are realistic and needed as we are talking about clashes of titans here. The special effects are fantastic and the fast moving plot kept me glued to the screen and in my seat. If there is a question as to which superhero film is the best adaptation, my vote is on the movie Man of Steel. Looking forward to the sequel.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Well ive deffinitley seen this before but its addicting and its way easier than temple run and the clorros they use are great if you like temple run or minion rush you'll love this game
B004SIMNF0|5.0|I use mine at weddings for up to 10 hours with a D3, Nikon 24-70 2.8,a SB900 flash with a battery pack, and lens pouch with assorted goodies in it. It fits snug and I love it. I have used the Cotton carrier and the double black rapid slings. I would still love to have a sling attached to this system for insurance like the Black Rapid, but with the Black Rapid when you bend over for something the camera can hit the ground and that just became to annoying. I have had back problems for years and I worried about the Spider hurting my back even more without some shoulder support but it quickly became my favorite system for weddings. I still use the other systems for other types of shoots. Did I mention I love this system. The only time it gets to be too much is when I add the second camera on my left hip. Also I'm a big guy, not tall 5-10 at 245 pounds and I like the feel of wearing it snug. It fits just over my hips,so it actually helps hold my pants up. I was very surprised how well this system felt when I tried it on with my gear at last years photo show in NY. If you have a chance go try one on you may as surprised as I was.
1594745692|5.0|These cards are great. The artwork on them is awesome! These cards are larger sized and easier to work with, my favorite deck! My only negative is that the little book that comes with it has very corny readings about zombies but I use another book to assist in all my readings anyways.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I love the entire Star Trek series and movie history. This 2009 version is honors the legends of the original in a fashion that just promise for many future Star Trek tales coming to the big screen.
B0058SNIC6|5.0|I wear these to work every single day. They are incredibly comfy and look just like normal flats. If they ever get dirty, I just throw them in the wash! These are wonderful shoes!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|is really comfortable. had a lot of space to put lens flash really nice. Fast shipping. i will recommend over and over
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent little game that harkens back to the 80s.<br />Remember those arcade games? Well thought out and challenging enough to keep one busy for a while. Great little game when you just need to &quot;waste&quot; a little time.
B000PC8AFU|4.0|STEVIE RAY VAUGHAN & FRIENDS-SOLOS, SESSIONS & ENCORES: Blooze rock guitar god STEVIE RAVE ON may have only released a small handful of albums during his short career, but thankfully, he also pumped out sidewinding licks behind an impressive list of like minded performers on his way to the top. SOLOS, SESSIONS & ENCORES collects relative rarities and greasy guest gigs, including searing live versions of ELMORE JAMES' THE SKY IS CRYING and OREO COOKIE BLUES with respective mentors ALBERT KING and LONNIE MACK. The passionate declaration YOU CAN HAVE MY HUSBAND, belted out by whiskey-voiced hot patootie LOU ANN BARTON (DOUBLE TROUBLE's original singer) and MARCIA BALL's party-packed rendition of SUGAR PIE DESANTO's SOULFUL DRESS add to the funky fun, while dive-bombing duels with surf guitar pioneer DICK DALE and the pyrotechnic JEFF BECK show off SRV's rock & roll mojo. Also on hand are swamp boogie queen KATIE WEBSTER, JIMMIE VAUGHAN and a seven minute version of DAVID BOWIE's commercial smash LET'S DANCE, which first hipped the masses to SRV's power. As both a six string slinging sideman and a solo superstar, SRV packed chops, charisma and Texas-sized talent to spare.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR GIGS
B009AMANBA|4.0|Although I'm not a &#34;history-buff,&#34; I did enjoy this movie. Day-Lewis is so multi-talented, and plays such a variety of characters. But, this is one of his better ones.  You can FEEL the torment in Lincoln's life, knowing so much rests in his hands. There's a great window to his family life as well, which only opens the viewer to empathize with all that this president had to deal with in his last years.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|One of my favorites of Austins storylines.<br /><br />This particular film incorporates the two variations of one section of Austin's book. Very well produced.
B009ICYPOS|3.0|Although I am a great fan of the Harry Potter novels by J.K. Rowling, I knew that this was going to be very different just from all the synopses and reviews I read but I felt compelled to check it out anyway. I wanted to experience for myself how well Ms. Rowling transitions into the mature, grown-up fiction genre after having written so successfully for the Young Adult fantasy market (though the HP novels are ageless in that they appeal to readers of all ages).<br /><br />The beginning is a bit plodding. Set in a small English town called Pagford, the story focuses on what happens when Parish Councillor Barry Fairbrother dies. This sets a whole series of events into motion - the now empty seat is termed a casual vacancy, and needs to be filled. Several residents are keen to fill this seat for various purposes, some who shared Fairbrother's politics and some who were violently opposed to him. The disagreement has to do with The Fields, a local council estate which some residents of Pagford look down upon and do not wish to see their tax dollars fund services such as the addiction clinic.<br /><br />The first third of the story was frankly tedious because there are so many details given about the cast of characters (of which there are many) - disgruntled spouses, crack addicts, an abusive husband and father, teenagers from broken homes leading desperate lives, and people in unhappy relationships.<br /><br />The two words that kept popping into my head as I listened to this story (I also read it through once) were \\"sad\\" and \\"desperate\\" - so many of the characters are deeply dissatisfied with their lives and their relationships and the tone of the novel is for the most part depressing. There's also a theme of desperation that runs throughout the story - young people desperate for reprieve from abusive and unbearable family situations, a wife who is at her wits' end, a grieving widow, and many more. This is certainly not a story for those looking for something uplifting. I'd like to think I'm a mostly optimistic person, but this story had me despairing for the characters and feeling a sinking sense of hopelessness as the story advanced.<br /><br />To be fair, J.K. Rowling writes well, and Tom Hollander does a credible job on the audible version - she has the flair for bringing out the best and worst in her characters as she did so well in the Harry Potter series. Unfortunately, she also resorts to tedious, unwarranted descriptions in many parts of the story that I felt could have been better edited.<br /><br />Towards the end, I found myself surprisingly developing a real concern for some of the less fortunate characters, especially among the teenagers and found myself genuinely caring about what happened to some of them. The climactic ending was a great blow to the gut and visceral in its description. For that, I give this otherwise so-so story three stars..

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game. Lots of stuff to do and places to go good job on this game. It's a lot more fun then subway suffer
B0085OF4GS|5.0|Top Secret comes from the Airplane! team.  It's a parody of Elvis/ Cold War Spy/ World War II/ films that never lets an anachronism or internal logic stand between the camera and a good belly laugh.  Val Kilmer is excellent in his first role, charismatic, with a good voice and great dance moves, and not afraid to be silly.  Really this film should get 4.5 stars, because it feels pretty dated (there's an extended Blue Lagoon parody), but enough with the nit-picking!  If laughter is the best medicine, watch this film and call your internist in the morning.
B00B7364H2|5.0|Every bit as good as the first collection with performances that range from excellent to Puyana's virtuoso performances, which redefine the instrument.  The MLP sound quality is legendary, competing with the best SACD's and embarrassing most.  This is a &#34;gotta buy&#34; even if you have to stay sober all weekend to pay for it.....just to put a relative value on a lifetime of enjoyment!
B005DC68NI|5.0|As a self-publishing author just starting out, this book was great!  I often get discouraged, but I just had to flip through a page or so of this book to get re-motivated!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The continued intensity was riviting. I also like the evolving character of Daryl(sp) trying to become a different person. The General has a great complicated nature.
B00D8H3Q2G|5.0|I own quite a few Vangelis cds, this sacd sounds incredible. If you like the sound track to this movie and have a sacd player sit back turn up the volume and turn off the lights, well worth the price.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game I like the horse and how u can ride them and enter competition's it's fun and great  I can't believe the graphics absolutely perfect
B0036R92V2|5.0|Got this after seeing &#34;Django Unchained&#34; and love it. I can see where Tarantino got a lot of his inspiration.  I highly recommend watching it in Italian, with the English subtitles.  The dubbing is poor and you don't get a feeling for how good the actors really were.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Disappointed in the last book of a good trilogy.<br />Ms Collins could have woven a better ending.<br />Not an uncommon problem with writers.
B009R9WAZ8|5.0|Love my cd!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game! We love the minions &amp; the game works great. My four year old &amp; I keep trying to beat each other's high score.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The book is nice and well written, but the topic is a bit of a repeat from other similar books by Neil Gaiman. The first chapter is excellent and it really gets you in, but afterwards it's only okay.
B008XJM8M8|4.0|The album I received skips in some parts, does anyone have any ideas on how to resolve the problem (it's a brand-new record player)
B008220DIC|1.0|This was the worst thing I have ever had the misfortune to see in the cinema.  I wish I had walked out after the first few minutes.  I kept waiting for the plot to start.  Then I released it had started, an hour ago.  I hadn't noticed.<br />In one scene the protagonist is driving on a motorbike until he is a speck on the horizon.  I found myself wishing very deeply the movie would there but of course it didn't.<br />If you want to watch good actors playing insane characters this is the movie for you!
B0026KX6TY|4.0|This movie is based on a true story which makes it all the more interesting.  The acting was very good. I recommend this movie, especially for fathers...let the kids have fun!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We really enjoy being able to have a lost weekend by watching multiple epsiodes. Thanks Amazon for providing the series.
B008Y6RFBE|5.0|Love DiCaprio, DD Lewis took me all the way in though!! That guy is brilliant!! Can watch it over and over just to watch him!! Love the set, the costumes, and though not totally accurate, I love the history value!! Really makes you think!!
B00DU74U74|2.0|There is not much to add to the other reviews. The movie was unfortunately boring, the main characters were flat and the dialogues poor. Through the book you can actually feel what Wanda/ Melanie are going through - not so much in the movie. Invest in the book is my suggestion. Very sad since I was looking forward to this. I hope there is a producer out there who would be willing to remake this with proper time investment and the right actors.
B00991TCOG|5.0|love Lindsey...she is amazing...the Magic of her music,all around great sounds; given to both friends and family as gifts and ever one has loved it
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I read all 3 books and found that the movie followed the story line very closely!!!  The books are great, and I liked the movie just about as much!!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Is a very fun game.quite addictive..good level design and is definately a decent level of challenge. I definately reccomend this game
B005LJITS0|2.0|It was disappointing and pretty boring, all in all.  The &#34;hero&#34; starts out in bed with some girl; since when did all superheros<br />check their morals at the door?  Saw similar thing in the last Superman movie.  Back when we 50+ folks were kids, superheros did not sleep around, or have kids out of wedlock.  Anyway, &#34;hero&#34; has way too much cockiness & bad attitudes. What a fine example for today's kids!  Plot was dragging, acting was lacking, just plain ole disappointing.  I'm glad it was rented & not purchased.
B000TU16GS|5.0|I loved this book. It was so swagalicous that I almost fainted. At first i didn't want to read it but I did anyways because yolo. all in all it was a swagalicous book
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi can really belt out a tune. She has an awesome voice and this album has a lot of great songs.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This game is fun but it crashes often on my Kindle Fire and will not connect to my FB account. Fix these glitches and it will be a 5 star game. Works fine on my phone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing,never-ending ,and will hook you the first time you play it . I highly recommend it to all ages of horse lovers.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|The best of the 2 books. Well written and excellent historical facts. Can't wait until number 3 comes out to continue the trilogy.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|This guy, Mayer Hawthorne was referred to me to listen too by a friend.  He showed me the CD case and I'm looking at this guy and said.... you can't be serious are you?  He said he's gonna be on Austin Lights tonight, so watch him.  So I turned on my Public Broadcasting Station on television and watch him on there and he was just INCREDIBLE!!  He has a great showmanship.  If he ever come here, I definitely want to see him in concert at any price.  His CD is so easy to listen too and he has a smooth R&B voice that captivates you and I find so unbelievably unreal that it coming out of his mouth.  He has different types of temples and rhythms throughout this CD so no matter what your taste in music is, I BET YOU WILL BE ABSOLUTELY SATIFIED and not disappointed listening to his CD.  As soon as I got it I put in in my CD player and been playing it since.  He's the type of singer where you don't mind listening to his songs over and over.  I highly recommend this CD!!!  It has slow tunes on it and fast tunes..... such a nice mixture!!  I plan on purchasing some more to give as gifts.  Buy this CD!!!
B004EPZ070|5.0|Movie was lite and entertaining.  Didn't drag on and on. Gave it to family member they ordered one for themselves.
B001KZG99A|3.0|The action and special effects were very well done.  Some plot elements were not very believable, however. Also,  I realize Tony Stark is supposed to be a playboy, but the bedroom scene could have been more subtly portrayed.
B00AO2P3GA|3.0|This game has only 12 levels that are far to easy to get by. the graphics are not the but they are ok. If you get this game,prepare for a game of bad graphics and boring levels.
B0098QBEXO|5.0|This is a really well-written and well-executed movie. It has a very strong ensemble cast.  The combination of cinematic beauty and human tragedy is very affecting.  Looking at the other reviews, the one thing I have to add is that it is really, really hard to watch from an emotional standpoint.  I've seen some depressing movies in my life, but none of them pushed my empathy buttons like this one.  Benedict Cumberbatch's unbelievably powerful acting is to blame.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|I love this game it is the best game I ever played and I recommend this fame to anyone who loves shooting games
B007FEFLTO|5.0|After finishing Fall of Giants, I immediately purchased Winter of the World.  I felt very connected to many of the characters from the first story and wanted to know what would happen to them in the second.  Even though some people have commented that \\"all the Nazis are depicted as evil and all the Americans are depicted as good,\\" I felt that most of Follett's characters in this series so far a very well developed and are quite dynamic.  Yes, there are some stereotypical \\"bad guy Nazis,\\" but I am sure that there were a number of people who were so hungry to gain power and/ or please Hitler that those characters are not unrealistic. On the other hand, not all of the American characters would be considered just \\"good guys.\\" Some have some hidden agendas that are quite selfish. I have also read reviews that mentioned that events in the plot were too predictable.  For me, knowing about some events in that era made it even more suspenseful.  (For example, I am familiar with the Night of Broken Glass, and I was eager to know how it would affect those characters who witnessed it.)  Yes, the Jewish characters were treated horribly, and I knew that the handicapped children would be sent away, but that is how it really was. A person can't re-write history to make it more \\"suspenseful.\\"  I am looking forward to the final book in the trilogy.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|Everyone should get this one.  It is interesting and quick to be about to see clips. Have fun to you all.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I read Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth series a number of years ago, and really enjoyed them. I have always been interested in early 20th century history, so I bought Fall of Giants.  Even though I know that most of the characters and specific plot elements are fictional, I really felt like I learned a lot about the World War I era.  The characters are so well developed that I felt a close connection to many of them the moment I was introduced to them. The details brought the story to life.  I found myself reading the novel late into the night a number of times without realizing how long I had read.  The only complaint I had was the number of characters that were introduced.  I was very happy that the Kindel version has the X-ray feature so I could occasionally be reminded who was related to whom in what way. Other than that, I would give this book an \\"A.\\"
B008XG1X18|5.0|Know that this is the most informative app. there is.  I can find just about everything I need for any project.
0800141660|5.0|This version of Sense and Sensibility is, buy far, my favorite! The acting is outstanding, and the scenery is beautiful. It is a beautiful story about finding &#34;True&#34; love. It is filled with humor, too.  It is an absolute delight!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read this whole book In a day and a half.. call it nerdy, but I couldn't put it down, and with good reason. It's easily the most real and well written book I have ever read. It pulls on your heart strings and makes you really think about how you want to go about living your life. I laughed, I cried, I ached , and I was both happy and sad right there along with the characters of \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\". I highly recommend it and will re read this book many more times.
0767020308|5.0|The tone or mood of this drama is just delightful. It is a light comedy and love story that will capture your attention. Jane Austen is so brilliant, and this adaptation would do her proud!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is ridiculously addictive. My toddler was enthralled with watching and trying to &quot;help&quot; me play.<br /><br />Lots of fun.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|First of all I would like to say that my original download of this app was fabulous!  I used it multiple times a day and considered it something I would always have on my Kindle Fire.  BUT the other day it upgraded to a new version and it is virtually useless with it's &quot;gameshow&quot; motif.  I have to say this, I tried to play along because it seemed like I was going to &quot;get something&quot; out of doing so but eventually I  began to feel like I was jumping through sponsor's hoops instead of being informed.  I am thinking of deleting this app and finding one that will work like the old one did. Thanks for the lousy upgrade.
B0042J6VUS|5.0|This is easy to use and works with my iphone like is said it would.  works great and fun to use.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Excellent mystery, action, all the things that make a book a &#34;page turner&#34;.  I couldn't put it down.  Dan Brown is a master at blending the reality of historical events with the story he is telling.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|this really works and I can hear what is going on around the room.  Very good easy to set up and use.
B000FA675C|5.0|I had previously read The Da Vinci Code in paperback and couldn't put it down then.  On the Kindle I couldn't put it down either.  Excellent mystery with plenty of action.  Dan Brown is a master of combining historical fact with the story he is telling.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|This album is awesome top to bottom. I have loved a lot of onerepublic songs and hated probably about as many, but there isnt a single song on here that I just can't stand. Can't stop is my personal favorite, very simple but i just \\"can't stop\\" listening to it lol !
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I missed this episode so was glad to purchase it & it streamed perfectly with all my devices so I have no complaint.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Really a lot of fun. Not real hard. Can't wait to get to next level. Would recommend for bubble game players.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Love the game doesn't make you wait to long and while you do wait you can shake the trees for money so you can play games the money does add up it just keeps you  occupied :D
B0083Z614S|5.0|Delightful read! Sort of Heidi met Jane Eyre type novel<br />Apparently I am required to type ten more words sigh
B001JNND9W|3.0|I got this is a gift but I did not like it not my kind of movie, I like comedys
1451695195|5.0|I'm excited to read this book - I've heard a lot of good things. The book came in excellent condition
B00C2IGQEW|4.0|This is a good Cop movie and based in Boston, not an everyday police movie it digs deep into the police dept. that some are corrupt .
B00992CF6W|5.0|it works good on other things and but for some reason on my kindle fire when I bought it it said it was an error and failed installing when oblong other kindle fires it works perfectly
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love playing Mahjong and I use this game as a way to kill time when I'm doing something mundane.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I can't wait for more levles. it is fun. it only took me a few mintues. I want to play more.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I'm still reading the book, but it is a real page turner. I'm a fan of the show, so I decided to read the books for myself.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this game. You meet with fun people and they try not to let it get boring. More credits would be nice but if you run out there is also slots.
B004I744AS|4.0|awesome dictionary app for kindle fire. it works offline and has a thesaurus. best of all it's free with a easy to navigate layout. highly recommend!
B003VANOFY|5.0|this headset is weird at times it will randomly disconnect and reconnect. i thought the range might be a factor but its range is great. the disconnect is usually about 1 second then it will reconnect and its rare. i will say i have been on skype left my computer and went downstairs and it was still connected. i even went in the basement to get clothes out of the dryer and it was still connected. overall the sound is good the 7.1 surround sound isn't going to be what you expect i just turn it off and use the headset normally
B006KX3GXO|1.0|its slow downloading but its awesome anyway JK it sucks -.- but its fine I used it and its slow that's my only problem thoe -.-
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This app makes you laugh.  I enjoy it a lot. I would recommend it for childrenn as well as adults.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|It's a rather short novel and an exciting read that is difficult to put down, as were the first two in the series. It is not just a suspense thriller, but has several powerful themes.  The more obvious internet focuses on the Swedish Secret Police and a vicious Russian spy defector..To me, the more meaningful meaningfully  theme is  about abuse against women. The main character, Lisbeth Salander, suffered horrible abuse as well as total violation of her civil rights  throughout all three novels. Most of the minor female characters also  suffer in some way, although there are several strong women who work hard to be the exceptions.  There is very little I did not like about the whole trilogy. I enjoyed Larrson,s clean, journalistic style, although he also was very descriptive and made some of the more sexual and violent scenes come alive,although not gratuitously.  On the rare occasions when Lisbeth chooses to speak she can have a foul mouth. Even Shakespeare used a little comic relief in his tragedies, and I would might have enjoyed just a little break, too. Perhaps Mikeal''s bed hopping and pillow talk was supposed to do that. Instead, I was bothered by his casual infidelities and Erica' long-term adultery with. Him ; thus he thoughtlessly  hurt Lisbeth.  My background is as a retired university instructor of speech, theatre and English from PA who was almost always more liberal than her students. I would recommend this trilogy to adults over18 who are interested in women's issues, civil rights, politics, police powers and democracy.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really great!!! You can compete in lots of fun competitions. Also, you can feed and groom your horse. Lastly, you can play lots of games with it!! (:
1582701709|5.0|I was some what sketchy at first because the price was so amazingly CHEAP, & for a new hardcover!! I received it in within days it really was a GREAT buy.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Before I could read every night my mom would read me a bedtime story. I had always interrupted her to ask what the big words meant . Now that I can read I know what a lot of words mean.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|One of the best book series I've read in a long time. I can't wait until the next book to come out.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AMAZING! I play it almost everyday building amazing creations. I have two nephews that also love this game and beg me to play. On creative all of the resources are unlimited and you can fly. on survival you can't fly and have to build or find the resources. the only down side is that in some places I have the game is laggy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is fun. But I wish things were easier to buy... Or cheaper. Good game but needs a few adjustments.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for my father for his birthday since myself and my family have enjoyed it so much.  He and my mom like it too.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game and when I was on a flight to Hawii I played that the whole way it's a great game for trips
B00BXKKNFS|1.0|It didn't work at all. In fact I received more ads than before. It also slowed down my Android phone to a crawl. I was getting ads before and after each game on Words with Friends and Spider. Worse than before. [[ASIN:B00BXKKNFS Adblock Plus]]
6305128952|4.0|condition is great, although I did not realize that it was in a wide screen format and I can not adjust my TV to fit to a full screen.<br />I will be more carefull in further purchases.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|The Harvey, Mike, Donna, Jennifer team at PearsonHardman law firm is amazing again! And waiting to figure out if Mike and Rachel can actually make it last! Definitely ready for season 3!
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|fresh and old fashioned (positive way) at the same time, coherent, very nice for your ears,  highly recommendable album :)
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Good mix of action and humor. It has some very funny scenes. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it, especially if you are a Tom Cruise fan.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|Great story I'm glad the story didn't end just yet. It was as good as I was expecting. Can't wait til the next book.
B001OQCV6K|4.0|Purchased this movie for my Dad for Father's Day. He had seen the movie and liked it enough to want to add it to his movie collection.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I've tried many styluses for the iPad (Adonit Jot, Hand Stylus, Bamboo) and in the end this is the one I am more comfortable with and the one I use when taking notes on my iPad. What I like best about this stylus is its hard tip, most stylus have a soft tip that doesn't fill quite right when writing.  Of course the width of the stylus might put some people off, but it is perfect for me.  I highly recommed this stylus.
B00A0HQ9GM|4.0|you won't regret buying this soulful album. lana is a musical genius - her lyrics are so full of truth and wisdom. BUY!
B008M721MS|2.0|I have 2 of the new Kindle Fire HD8 version 6 tablets.  Skype works ok, but it does not ring on incoming calls.  You have to have the app open with the screen on, and not using any other programs for it to ring.  If someone wants to skype me, they have to call me first, then I get Skype loaded up, they skype me, then I hang up the phone.  It kinda defeats the purpose of the software.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is one of those movies you can watch over and over.  There is something new in it every time you watch it.  My son watches it on repeat and it really isnt that irritating.  You know the story, just watch it, and enjoy it.
B006DRVFRQ|2.0|I have this for my phone and it's great, but this app needs an update so that users can migrate from reader to the old reader or feedly, like the phone app got. Currently not functional, as far as I can tell. Would like to be able to utilize it like I do on my phone via the old reader.
0307346617|5.0|I had a first edition copy I bought on the day it came out.  It is a very solid addition to the zombie mythos and if there is a zombie book everyone should read this is it.  It is a pretty decent story that follows an outbreak from the beginning to the end and how people survive it and make mistakes along the way.  Do not confuse this with the movie.
B009Y6231U|4.0|leave your brain at the door pop some pop corn and enjoy great Kurt Russell movie always fall back when nothing is on
1781162646|4.0|A big Stephen King fan!  I liked this book, even though it wasn't you typical Stephen King fare.  Took turns that left me breathless at time.  Recommend.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Neil's talents just shine through on this set, highlighting some of his most magical musical moments. I bought this in tandem with the guitar songbook, helpinhg reintroduce me to Neil's brilliance, and finally figuring out &#34;Needle and the Damage Done&#34;
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Honestly one of the best apps of its kind. But it can be hard if your prone to flipping over on this type of game. My favorite app... love it.
B001DA9VJW|5.0|This where much of it started for many musicians. A first listening of Robert Johnson recordings, wherever they could be found. Gritty, honest, and pure magic. Musical treasures!
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album does not disappoint.  You can hear the echoes of there classic sound thru out this new recording. It is TRUELY amazing to hear them back together again and recreating the magic that gave birth to an entire genre.<br /><br />A must have for any Black Sabbath Fan.<br />Yes, I would recommend this to a friend.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|As long as you are able to zoom in on items in the room and collect images in the squares to the right, then it's  working...keep trying! The items stored in the boxes to the right are clues or &quot;keys &quot; to solving the puzzle. Let's  say a spot that you tap allows you to zoom in on an image and that image displays four blank spaces and let's  say that another image in the room has four colors or numbers (like a date) try entering those colors or numbers into the blank spaces. If that doesn't help, then either your game or device isn't  working properly or puzzle games just aren't  for you. This is a quick but clever game!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I'm a 37 yr old guy who loved Mario growing up and this ia just like it. thanks and here's 5 stars
0062255657|5.0|This is my first Neil Gaiman book and I absolutely loved it. Such a fantastic fairy tale brought to life. Such wonder and possibilities from ones childhood imagination.  I loved the innocence of the child to the horrors of reality right underneath his feet. Such wonderful description all through the book, so easy to get lost in.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|LoL. Love Love Love this movie and got it for a great deal! Too bad DVDs will soon be extinct.
B003IWRE3I|5.0|Loved this movie, thanks for making it available! The acting by both leads was fantastic, and the story was heartbreaking and beautiful to watch.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Fantastic movie , special effects were well done. Acting was great. Highly recommend this flick. Definitly a guys kind of movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If this could be real life, I'd take it. Without a doubt. Two hands down. Greatest series I've read in a while.
B002KCO6QA|5.0|I personally thought the movie was great. The end was a real suprise. Special effects were ok, not great and I was surprised by the lack of actors needed for the flick. I watched the movie twice and will probably watch it again. Great movie and great acting by Sam Rockwell.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded it and..... it froze my kindle fire I had to shut it down! If you don't want for your tablet or kindle to freeze don't download!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love love love this show!! Maggie Smith's character is hilarious, and I love British shows like this one. Cannot wait to watch season 3.
B00821OX98|5.0|I liked this show because of the characters and I am a Sci Fi addict.  It is somewhat believable for our present state of technology.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|this coulda, shoulda been a better movie.  its a remake of a twisted story from days gone by but I have to say that only Rooney Mara is worth watching.  Chan Tatum is wasted other than eye candy.  I don't know how Cath Z-J gets parts anymore.  Don't waste your time UNLESS you are REALLY bored.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I took a gamble on this book. But, after reading it and loving it, I ended up buying Losing Hope, Slammed, This Girl, and Point of Retreat by Colleen Hoover and read them all in just a few weeks. Highly recommend.
B00A2H9P98|5.0|I have seen this movie four times and I would go again in a heartbeat.  Sure, it has its political undertones but what movie doesn't nowadays.  It's everything I enjoy in a movie.  Plenty of action, big name stars - and yes, I know Channing Tatum was a dud in the first G.I. Joe but I think he redeems himself with this one -could have been a little less language in my opinion, but other than that I could find nothing wrong with it.  Rolland Emerich is always great at making action/disaster movies.  I go to the movies to be entertained. I found this movie highly entertaining.  At one point my daughter leaned over to me and said, \\"Boy this movie is tense!\\"  She was biting her nails the whole way through! The ladies behind us kept gasping and oohing all the way through.  When it was over all three of them clapped delightedly.  Hope you'll at least give it a try!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|might be my favorite book to date. So many moments where I was excited to the point of actual victory cries while reading it.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is very well written. I find myself pulled to the characters. Hoping and longing right along with them. In the reviews I have seen on this book have said how much this book was like fifty shades of grey. I can see the settle details but feel this book is open and has more raw sexual feeling in it.
B0000026NC|5.0|THis is one of the origional hits of a day gone by, for all Pink Floyd Fans and others as well!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I simply enjoy playing for hours !!!  I can stay overnight with this game. Everything is so well designed. Y mattel
B00170F0WU|4.0|This a very interesting Movie . Natalie Portman as a little girl tooks up to the Man who saves her from Dangerous Criminals that just happen to work for the DEA!!
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|This game is so good ITS unbelievable. It's like black OPS. the only problem is the aiming is pretty hard.
B003IEJZUG|3.0|This got great reviews, however, for my taste way too violent.  I got half way through and had to put it down.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoy games that make you use your brain and this one does that nicely. Graphics are good and the little puzzles within the levels provide an extra dose of brain train!
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Lost one of the discs so repurchased the whole thing.  My grand-daughters and I sit and watched the whole series.  My youngest likes Jacob and my oldest is an Edward and Bella Fan.
1449325947|5.0|I recently read a number of CSS books as part of a project to convert a web applicaiton to more current web standards. The Missing Manual CSS3 book was one of my favorites. It's not easy to cover something as complex as modern CSS styling, but I enjoyed the book and got a lot out of it.<br /><br />G.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A little slow getting into it.  But a great story nonetheless. I thought it certainly sets up for the next book.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I just finished the last book of The Wheel of Time Series and my foremost emotion is one of loss that it is over.  When I got book 14 I went back to the beginning and read over every book in the series from page one.  I grieved at every loss in this final book because I too was losing old friends.  I will read them all again sometime, just as I have re-read The Lord of the Rings so many times in my life; but there is only one first time, or is there?  The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills.
B00821OX98|5.0|I recently watched a YouTube video (thanks PBS!) discussing why we are so into zombie genre content and what the next great thriller will be... Given the recent popularity of Falling Skies, Pacific Rim, etc. I think this is a good candidate.<br /><br />The post apocalyptic world is awesomely represented in this smart thriller. Move over body snatchers... this is the real deal!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Me and my friend love to play SUBWAY SURFERS. WE CAN PLAY IT FOR HOURS IF WE HAVE THE CHANCE I LOVE IT TAKES U TO DIFFERENT PLACES
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Love these styles of games. This one was very trying at times. Wish there h<br />ad been a hint button to help with some of the floors. Overall it was very challenging and I enjoyed it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am impressed with the story lines of each episode and the acting and production is excellent.  I treat myself to each episode like dessert.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game omg its amaaaazzziiiinnnn!!!!!!!! you should totally get this game and even little kids can learn my three yr old sis is almost better than me RECOMMENDED FOR YOU!!!<br /><br />-kessa
030758836X|1.0|I don't understand all of the hype surrounding this book. I hate to trash it, because obviously the author took a lot of time and effort to write it, but it was painful at times to read. The writing is juvenile and underestimates the reader, in my opinion. The first few chapters were painful, but I muddled through, hoping the book would live up to the rave reviews. Sadly, it got worse, with unbelievable, underdeveloped characters, who all seem to use the same language, metaphors, etc. I don't understand the reviews claiming that the writing is good, but the ending was bad. The ending was no worse than the rest of the book. For me, the poor writing was distracting, and I found myself rushing to get to the end. How is this book getting so many good reviews?
B00AFROVQC|4.0|The story keeps me coming back and I can't wait for book #7. That said I felt like the writing lacked a little in creativity. The author repeated words so much so that I found it a bit distracting. I also felt that the characters lacked depth. It would have been nice to see the characters develop over time and see how they matured over this epic journey.<br /><br />I will definitely buy the next book, I'm addicted to fantasy sci-fi series. I just hope that Rice expands his vocabulary.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So fun its like temple run but better so many cool characters and places the best game I ever played on handheld devices
1936719118|5.0|\\"Anything You Want,\\" by CD Baby founder, Derek Sivers, is a brilliant and honest account of one man's idea come to fruition. Derek offers a glimpse into his unique, \\"can do,\\" mind. Taking the road of \\"no problem, opportunity,\\" he walks us through his experience like a good dad walking beside his child on their first bike ride without training wheels, whispering words of encouragement and keeping a strong hand at the ready. Highly recommended!
B004WR125O|5.0|Connects my Onkyo 616 to my wireless internet, does it well, and quickly. Should've been included, and was included in the newer version of the Receiver. It can plug into the front or back of the receiver, and when plugged in, has the receiver prompt the user for a wireless network to connect to and asks for its password. Currently using an Ethernet connection, so I can't comment on its strength and abilities.
B000OLRH10|5.0|This is a really good movie to watch.This is one movie that I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It's just as good as I expected.  Can't wait for season 4.  And I love the convenience of Amazon instant video!
B005EHQGTS|5.0|For a tech-mad person like myself, this app is a must have! It allows me to remotely connect to my laptop through the wifi so easily and quickly with a few simple touches of my KindleFire HD. As this app is the HD version, I was expecting a great quality picture and I definitely have that; a perfect replica of my laptop screen.<br /><br />What makes it so great is that I can now read documents, access music and videos I own and use multiple websites for videos/games that usually my Kindle won't let me me do, such as narutospot narutospot where I watch the latest anime episodes. All of this can be achieved without moving off the sofa (or whilst walking around the house).<br /><br />Simple controls once you are used to them and uses my kindle keyboard which is very useful. Some great security features too to ensure your privacy is protected. Love this app! By far the best one I've downloaded.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it is so addicting I love it. I cant stop playing it. I have a kindle fire. It works awesome.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|The reviews on the graphics are extremely accurate.  It is just a beautiful game.  I enjoy the daily homework rewards and haven't gotten bored with it yet.
B0085157B8|5.0|Really enjoyed this tongue in cheek sci fi crapfest!  The overwrought acting, corny dialogue, and bouncing saline bags.<br />What could be better!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Yes, it is very addicting.  I just love this game.  I tried to take it off my kindle, but wound up downloading it again.
B0000DC13U|5.0|The scenes in the studio,literally capture the birth of the title song in the studio. A fantastic fly on the wall witness experience to the creation of rock and roll's literary masterpiece
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was exactly what I thought it was.  And, the kiddos just love playing it.  The graphics are great to watch.
B004EAQNO4|4.0|Very nice updated philosophical horror tale in the style of Twilight Zone, Ending twist not too stretched<br />and very nice intensity between the players.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use and I do use it all the time.  I enjoy being able to use it quickly when I have a hard time finding my other calculator.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Dexter is one of the best shows I ever started watching. I could not wait for the next season to start televising. If you like a dark but funny, sad, and a tad scary, you need to watch dexter and enjoy this \\"Slice of Life\\".
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is actually better than 100 floors and I really love that game.  I enjoy stretching my mind trying to find the clues!
0316010669|4.0|As I was trying to look for a book to read, I came across Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. The book title in itself already caught my attention. Why wouldn't you be curious about the power of thinking without thinking? I am one of those people who judges the book by it's cover, through it's aesthetics and the effectiveness of the title. If for some reason the book was not written by Malcolm Gladwell, whom already published four best selling books, I would still grab the book in a blink! It's simple and straight to the point and the content of the book was as consistent to how your first impression of the title itself.<br /><br />Blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking is about `rapid cognition' as the psychologist termed our way of thinking in a blink of an eye. It is about how we think without thinking, about choices that seem to be made in an instant that aren't as simple as they seem. It presents a series of example from different levels of professions that had the ability to efficiently make the right decision instantaneously. It describes how innate it was for some people to make snap judgements accurately even though these people didn't even know how exactly they knew what they knew. It is about that subconscious feeling lingering that there is something right or wrong about a current situation. One of the many examples from the book were the Kouros, a statue brought to Getty's Museum, which was thoroughly inspected for its authenticity and even brought to different places and even took sampled fragments to be tested for its legitimacy. It took four months for the museum to finalized their decision that it was indeed genuine but when it was shown from a Kouros expert who was just there for a visit, the experts initial response was \\"Anyone who has ever seen a sculpture coming out of the ground could tell that that thing has never been in the ground\\". Gradually, the argument for the legitimacy of the kouros fell apart.<br /><br />The book also explored about how we perceived other at first glance. How we have a glimpse of an idea of who they are as a person. He termed it as \\"thin-slicing\\" meaning deducing an information from the whole picture and coming up with an idea that makes sense from the whole. Gladwell also explains how we tend to mind read a person by observing their behavior or physical attributes from that specific moment and coming up with a basic idea of knowing them. He tries to explain about how a certain person would be affected by their judgement inaccurately if given a detailed background. \\"Thin-slicing\\" is by eliminating the unnecessary elements that would lead to incorrect assumptions.<br /><br />Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking transcends to how you would perceived your way of thinking. After reading this book, you become conscious about your reaction to instances and the accuracy of your judgement. It is about knowing which information to eliminate and which ones to keep. I got engaged in this book mostly because it made me aware about how I'm thinking and how I would help it think the right way.<br /><br />I'm a fiction book reader, I love reading stories because it engages me and it suck me in to that situation. Blink: the Power of Thinking Without Thinking is one of the few non-fiction books that left me wanting more. This book creates a domino effect leaving you thirsty for more written books by Malcolm Gladwell.
B009NY43NY|2.0|***A few spoilers but nothing major***<br /><br />I'm not going to write some crazy lengthy review because a lot of posters really summed it up. I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1 because I was able to finish the book, which to me is all the difference.<br /><br />It's not about who she ended up with or even the ending - it's about what constitutes a good read.<br /><br />What disappoints me the most is that the book was straight up boring. I actually had to skip pages and pages. I think Sookie showered 4 times, and each and every meal she ate was described in detail. (Did anyone actually count?) For almost 70% of the book, literally, nothing happened.<br /><br />Eric barely had an appearance. No one I really cared about showed up much, or they simply overstayed their welcome by a long shot. The villains were terrible and uninteresting. And rarely showed up.<br /><br />Long story short - or short story long, however you want to think about it - anything interesting that happened was in the last 10 pages of the book, and most of it was a rushed explanation of what went down.  Almost an afterthought. It was a total \\"lets just sum this up real quick and patch up any holes\\" ending. Terrible.<br /><br />I know you all need closure and I'm not saying don't read it, just expect to feel like you paid way too much for this book. The publishers should be pretty embarrassed. Whatever the author was trying to accomplish just didn't work for me.

0553801473|5.0|It's a great book and I can't wait for the next one to come out. You learn so much more about the story line, characters, and plots when you read one of Martin's books. It was so funny when the last season ended and everyone who hadn't read the books was horrified when some of the main characters were killed off. Everyone who had read the books knew it was coming! READ the books they are great.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Top notch recording, performance, presentation = An audiophile nirvana.  This disc is definitely a reference-grade disc for any audiophiles.  Highly recommended.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|Initially I puchased this product was purchased in order to play with a PS2 controller on an Xbox 360 system. Upon getting the product I assumed that it would be a simple plug and play.  I have a converter for Xbox to PS3 and that's exactly how it works.<br /><br />Upon closer inspection I noted that there were 6 switches on the back of the unit.  I thought, interesting must be for each of the buttons or something; wrong!  Apparently there are different settings depending on what you're sinking too.  On top of that the instructions of how to set them for your system goals are very vague and confusing.<br /><br />I must not of utmost importance is the fact that if you are using this for a PS2 pad to an Xbox 360 system, it states that you must have the original controller plugged into it first.  Once that works, then you may plug in your PS controller.  I did not have a wired Xbox controller.  So I bought one and did as instructed.  The unit still did not work.  I tried every combination possible with the switches, un plugging and trying to re sync each time with no result.<br /><br />There is absolutaly no contact info for the company contained within the packaging for assistance.  I'm going to try a different converter from a different company.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Great story with an ending that will make you smile. GRISHAM never disappoint s his readers. Got to get this
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Might have loved it if it would have worked.  Guess it was only a buck but it was a wasted buck.
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|Love Bruce Willis in this role, humour, though dry is spot on, lot of tongue in cheek, usual great action and wonderful<br /> report between him and his movie son. Watch it!
159463176X|3.0|I was looking forward to Hosseini's third book because I loved the first two.  While I enjoyed the many insights into human character, I found the storyline hard to follow.  There was going back and forth in time without warning, as well as keeping track of numerous characters. The ending was very satisfying.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The bundy's are just as funny now as they were 20 years ago!!  All of the DVDs are stacked into 2 piles, it is a little time consuming finding the DVD you want and they might scratch, if they are moved around a lot.  Otherwise, this is the best value for your money.  The more expensive version has the DVDs individually stored.  You are paying for packaging on the more expensive version they are exactly the same DVDs!!!!
B0055V6EZE|4.0|The music is worth the cost of this CD in my opinion, but although the musicians are very accomplished (including Hugh Laurie), Laurie's vocals have no blues \\"feel\\" to them, no burr or vibrato or other features with which to imbue the music with feeling above and beyond the listener's reaction to the lyric and instrumental ornamentation. He can howl in agony with the best of them, but the rest of his range as seen here seems to be a pleasant, in-tune but rather unremarkable one.<br /><br />So my critical vocabulary isn't up to snuff either.<br /><br />The CD is packaged in a gatefold cardboard sleeve with minimal ornamentation on the inside.<br /><br />The disc is slipped into the left hand pocket, a booklet of liner notes and other stuff in the right, both of which can be accessed without opening the sleeve (so why bother with the gatefold?). The booklet is the usual challenge to people with old, tired eyes. It simply isn't possible to do a proper job on a 5 inch square booklet, no matter how many pages you cram in.<br /><br />I'm enjoying the music, but I don't think it will be in my A-list rotation on my too-small iPod. More stuff to put on while doing something else for me, for most of my moods.<br /><br />Your mileage will of course vary.
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|Bought for the wife.  She loves it!. First season is only available online and it's been driving her nuts since she started into the season late.
0440245915|4.0|John Grisham's premier novel. Powerful, haunting, masterfully written and highly relevant for these times. This book examines under a microscope the moral dilemma of vigilante justice as it might have unfolded in Mississippi a few years after the Civil Rights movement. While I don't think I totally agree with the main viewpoints espoused by the author--that one of the primary issues in this intense drama concerned race, and that heinous circumstances sometimes necessitate exacting revenge--Grisham presents a thorough and compelling case. He's a magnificent storyteller and packs each page with gut-wrenching emotion. Splendid word choices.<br /><br />Glad I read this book. Don't think I would read it again. Don't know whether I'd recommend it.
B0036S4B6M|4.0|I thought her experience was very interesting.  I loved hearing about the different relationships she was able to make.  I just thought it ended so abruptly and just without any real conclusion which left me feeling slightly dissatisfied.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|a great self help book. Keeps you concentrating on how to live your best life. also an easy read. Enjoyed itl
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I am having so much fun playing this game. its a blast. really enjoying it. don't wanna stop playing. yay. lol to much fun
B005LAIIJY|5.0|This movie is serious, funny, sad, historic and disgusting all at the same time. I loved it. All of the stars were good,but I think  Sam jackson took it to another level. Everyone should see it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game. Its very interactive and th graphics really do surpass other horse game apps that I have seen. It isn't laggy or glitchy for me, and there is tons to do.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very suspenseful. Now I'm not a big fan of love on the first date but she somehow makes it work!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game is easy to play and a good challenge.<br />I really like that it asks for your age to set up.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|First of all, it was delivered on time and in perfect condition. Absolutely NOTHING wrong!<br />About the movie: I'm 15 and this has been my favorite movie since I was three. I love the story. It's timeless! Even if this movie was made in the 50's every kid can relate to it. I love this restored edition, it's much better than my dinosaur-aged VCR tape lol. Very recommended!
B005LAIIJY|5.0|The movie was Great, but it could have been a little shorter. Some parts were really drug out. Jamie Fox was  excellent.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|I love this show and the cast.  It is a well written show and the singing is absolutely beautiful!  Great
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game and how it has been to so many places my personal favorite was Miami but I wish the prices for characters and hoverboards hoverboardswere cheaper.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|It was such a great book.  it had me hooked the whole way threw! Loved all books from Lauren Oliver ossss
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I truly enjoyed this recording. I am old enough to remember the first Black Sabbath Albums and although the group was not my favorite, I recognized the power and darkness that made many of my contemporaries go absolutely NUTS over this group.<br />Although made from the same cloth, this is not just a remake of music from times past, it definitely has it's own personality and drive.<br /><br />I would recommend this recording to anyone too young to remember the power and doomy control Black Sabbath had over many young people in the 70s (and 80s), and also to old guys like me, who can find new and inventive ideas in this new recording from this iconic group.<br /><br />By the way, although the drummer is not the original, he is fantastic and really captures the sound of one era , while bringing his own magic to a new millennium.<br /><br />I recommend this recording to all audiences who just want to ROCK!<br /><br />Dr. Gregory Woll
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Remember a long time ago when Queensryche's music had emotion and power?<br /><br />It's back.<br /> Incredible. The other reviewers say it better than I. Todd's voice is amazing on this album, the music/songs/production the best since Mindcrime.<br /><br />This type of comeback with this level of music is practically impossible. And they knocked it out of the park.<br /><br />\\"In This Light\\" May be my favorite QR song ever.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The science is sound: huma race developed in conditions where nourishment wasn't constant. Some time you starved, sometimes you gorged.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This album shows that they still have it in them to record really great heavy metal music.  All the animosity that arose was nessisary to bring this new musical direction.
B009IJJB8G|5.0|I love this show. The recent resurgence of Sherlock in movies and BBC productions (also wonderful, BTW) makes me so happy. Elementary is well-cast and thoughtful and so very real.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice game with good graphics.  The biggest downfall is waiting  for energy to build for training and competitions and the lack of opportunity to earn gems. Over all the game is worth the download.  It will keep you and your school age kiddos entertained.
B005K17RU0|1.0|Crashes all the time on Kindle fire.  Locks up on radar screen.  Causes nothing but problems. Glad its free. Would not be happy if it were a purchase.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|You need to think more about how to get more points and coins out of each run,, making it a long-term game. On the other hand, the end scenes are less amusing than the original.
0765348780|1.0|This book is incomprehensible.  In fact, I didn't read a comprehensible passage until past the half way point.  There are so many different types of magic, sorcery, wizardry, alchemy, necromancy, etc, practiced by so many different types of people and beings, with so many different allegiances, from so many different places, times and dimensions, all intermingled with obscure references, that the story is absolutely impossible to follow.  It makes Game of Thrones...perhaps the greatest adventure series ever written, and possessing it's own complex plot twists, read like a Bugs Bunny cartoon.<br /><br />The characters lack any level of warmth or empathy, you cannot tell the good guys from the bad guys...i.e., assuming there are good guys and bad guys, and there isn't a single character that the reader would have the slightest interest in caring about.  Human or otherwise.  And yet, they come in and out of the story, interact and do stuff without any apparent relationship to a central theme.<br /><br />I understand the Malazan Book of the Fallen is a very popular series, although the image I have of its' adherents is of socially inept, cigarette chain smoking, coke and coffee guzzling, pizza eating geeks playing video games all night long. What they find cool about the series is it's very incomprehensibility.  Kind of like pug lovers, who find something cool in owning the ugliest, most ill-tempered dog imaginable.  It's an in thing among a select circle of people. We not only own a pug but we love Malazan.  Wow! Look how cool we are.  And therein lies the title of this review: The Emperor's New Clothes.  Google it....you'll see what I mean.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|The score is fabulous.  I started crying the minute the movie started, because I knew every note and what the music portended.  Great acting, and the direction is superb.  Each and every actor is a person to him/herself.  I'm old, so this may not be what you would want to subject your grandchild to, but it was the best recently released movie I've seen for a very long time.
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|I forgot how cloths and makup were back in the 80's. My other bluray just didn't show this amount of detail!
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|I had all of these original LPs.  Then when we sold our house and moved into our RV full time I had to down size and get rid of my LP collection.  I'm so glad I could replace the entire collection with these CDs.

B001NUO1HE|4.0|Liking just about anything with Paul Walker, this movie was easy to watch. The story line is fairly predictable, but it's still entertaining. I've seen it before and will likely see it again.
B003L77GH4|5.0|I really enjoy watching this series.  I put in the dvd and its hard to stop watching it till the end.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|My wife (who is older than me) had never seen this movie.  We had a date night just so we could watch Goonies, and she loved it!
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I love watching this series.  Its hard to not watch the entire dvd in one setting. Cant wait till the next series becomes available.
B001NKI60W|4.0|This was a fun musical! I enjoyed the story and the film is just great. The basic story a a girl searching to find her real dad before she is married. The characters are fun and the storyline is great.
B00CM96A60|5.0|I love this album! Classic, and yet evolving, AVB sound! Hoping for an AVB visit to Houston soon! Anyway, buy this album!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|This was an OK movie. Clearly made for those looking to watch some male stars get naked and dance. All aside the storyline is actually pretty good. As always Channing Tatum is great!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Here is one of the best TV shows of it's genre.  Cancelled far too early.  The Blu-ray is an excellent addition for anyone who enjoyed the show - great extras, great picture, and great sound.  Truly worth adding to a movie collection.
B002D0L0R2|5.0|If you enjoy musical movies with comedy then you'll love this movie. This movie is a classic it never stops cracking me up. Overall is an enjoyable film to watch.
B001KOFH2G|3.0|This movie was okay for what it was.  However, it did not meet the standards most fans seemed to have for it.  There were great special effects and amusing jokes.  But the characters were radically different in many cases and the story did have the same feel to it that the show did.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is the CD we all hoped for when DTC came out. Every song is GREAT!! The sound and production quality is EXCELLENT!! IF you have ever been a QR fan  buy this CD, you will not be let down. (yes no one can replace GT...........but someone actually did)
630542828X|3.0|I bought this movie mainly for the chance to add another Travolta film to my collection.  Although the film makes many interesting points about the legal system and people's rights therein, it isn't the most exciting of stories.  The plot just seemed to move along at a slow pace and the ending seemed a bit anti-climatic, in my opinion.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I would recommend anyone to watch this show.  It is very witty and exciting.  I'm glad that I was able to start this show now and get to catch up.
B006M4RN3U|5.0|I love this cd.  It is different from anything I have heard and what I listen to.  On this album, I cannot skip one track.  There are not that many albums that I can say that about.  The song &#34;We Are Young&#34; is the song that got me into this band  Every time I hear it gives me goosebumps.  It is that powerful.  Buy this album. I promise you will not be disappointed.

0743487486|2.0|The author seems to get in the way of his own message in this book. I picked this book up because unconditional parenting seems like it would fit with my own worldview. Unfortunately, I found this book unreadable. Alfie, the author, is very judgmental of just about everyone it seems, and it just isn't fun to read someone endlessly and inaccurately ranting about other people. I can get plenty of that for free on the internet, thank you.<br /><br />To pick an example of his inaccurate negativity, behaviorist do focus on behaviors, but characterizing them as not caring about what goes on in children's heads, or calling their tactics \\"withholding love\\" and \\"bribery\\" is offensive. I would be fine with him criticizing other methods of parenting, but he goes beyond that to demonizing, and that's just not constructive. You will never convince someone that they are not only wrong, but pure evil. And knowing people with those strategies, and knowing they aren't thoughtless monsters who don't care about what goes inside children also makes this a strong turn off.<br /><br />Even this would probably be something that could be sighed at and overlooked if he didn't also cast such a wide net. It seems that he is constantly saying how no one thinks of these basic things, like maybe their requests are unreasonable. Every parent I know, including myself, has gone through quite a lot of self questioning, so this seems like an excessively negative view of humanity. And given that he seems to hold such a distorted view of adults, it does make me wonder how well he understands children.<br /><br />It's possible that there are actually better parts of this book. I tried starting at the beginning, and I tried flipping around through it and I tried going to the first chapter that actually had a positive title (Chapter 7, \\"Principles of Unconditional Parenting\\", 117 pages in). Even there I still got one paragraph of what parents should do followed by more looking down on how people currently raise children.<br /><br />So that's the issue. I picked up this book because I was interested in how Alfie Kohn thinks we should raise children, and instead I keep being presented with how parents are generally terrible people. This book was just not what I was looking for.raise children.<br /><br />So that's the issue.

B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like the fact that you can mix or layer sounds to get exactly the sort of sound you want. The sounds and melodies are soothing, and can be mixed hundreds of ways. You can save a mix once you have it just right, and there is a sleep timer to turn the app off. It was definitely worth the price.
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I enjoyed it. Good beach reading, but I was totally startled by the ending. The story ended with such abruptness!
B009C7JS14|4.0|This a useful app,but a little hard to get comfortable with. The time is very good if you travel a lot, the weather is a good tool to help plan the day.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|4.5 stars. 2 ports in one.  There seemed to be a lot of negative reviews due to folks not reading the description RE output wattage.  They have designed the two circuits to match the specs of the products.  The only flaw IMO is that the lettering on the front is very difficult to read. So make sure you know which port is which, or plug your devices in, BEFORE you start driving (or pull over).  I keep this item in the glovebox as a backup for my Samsung Galaxy SIII and in case anyone needs to charge their iPhone in my car.  I use the Samsung factory charger primarily.  I have not noticed a significant difference in the charging times.  Neither charger is particularly fast, but that is the way they are supposed to operate to optimize battery life. As described if you attach 2 devices at the same time they will take longer to charge. It will also get warm so you should unplug it when you are not charging your device. 'Rapid chargers' might charge your phone/device faster but they are not optimal for you battery and some may cause damage to your battery if they don't match the design specs.  In summary, this is a good product which can charge multiple devices stand alone or together.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game to kill some frrree time... even little bit addictive. coud be less greedy as lot of options are paid...
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Great special features.<br />Very detailed.<br /><br />I can't wait until Disney/Lucas does a Episode 7 or even a side episode with a young Han Solo in his smuggler days.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I like the book it was just enough romance and action and I give all five stars I loved the book
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Enjoyed finding out about all the research that went on in finding Osama bin Laden and the actual raid itself.
B0054LJGWS|5.0|This was a wonderfully humorous book with a serious plot filled with wonderful ironic cynicism.  In short, an engaging read with a plot that allowed the authors to reflect on religion, happiness, good-and-evil, military pseudo-intelligence and overnight delivery services.  The more you read, the more you want to keep reading.  I was sorry when it was finished, even though the ending was very satisfying.<br />I'm an avid reader of Gaiman's novels, and I particularly enjoyed American Gods.  I've read all the Discworld novels and accept with regret that there shall be no more.  These two authors really know how to tell a tale and how to infuse humor into the plot with extraordinary turns of phrase.  This one's well worth the read and the e-version had only a few conversion errors.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This was a really good book . Kaleb was so much more than I expected and I loved Sahara. It didn't surprise me who the Ghost was. Their story was so very special . Highly recommend this book.
B00BOTCKCW|4.0|Parade's End is a 5 part mini-series that is at times complicated, frustrating and utterly beautiful. Taking place just before WW1 and during, it is more than just a war film, it is also a maddening tale of a brilliant man always trying to do what is right. Benedict Cumberbatch plays Christopher Tietjens, an extremely bright, intellegant gentleman (in every sense of the term), who gets thrown into a marriage of duty.  Though the backstory is sparce, what we know is he meets a beautiful woman, Sylvia (Rebecca Hall) on the train and well, it all very quickly leads to a baby. Unfortunately, it is never known if the baby is utterly Christopher's, as Sylvia is not exactly a proper lady in certain regards. But, duty-bound, he marries her quickly. From this point on, we are witness to a marriage only by name. Sylvia is a selfish, arrogant snob who has absolutely no problem with sleeping around for her own amusement. She barely acknowledges her son, looks down upon her husband, and pretty much makes a mockery of their union. She is a typical, rich, spoiled brat. Christopher has the patience of a saint. He puts up with all of this, with all of her, knowing exactly what it is she is doing, and has done. Even when Sylvia runs away to Germany with her lover, he refuses to divorce her or in any way shed light on the scandal.<br /><br />That is not to say he is without faults. He makes absolutely no demands of his wife. Clearly, there is zero intimacy and his attitude towards her is polite and straight to the point. She finds him cold, and many a time tries to elicit some sort of response or feeling from him, but all in vain. I'm not quite sure what to make of it since again, we get so little backstory. I have not read the novels so maybe someone can shed some light on this matter. It is almost frustrating at times to watch these two characters on screen because you want something to happen, but it never comes to fruition. He takes her back without thought when she gets tired ofher lover, and she returns to a life nearly identical to the one she left behind. And then The War strikes and everything that Christopher has tried to keep maintained, his beliefs and principals and even his personal life, slowly start to unravel.<br /><br />Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect actor for this role. I'm not sure how he compares to the character in the novel, but I couldn't care less on that account. He is surrounded by this almost constant melancholy and every move is made with precision. He is so subtle in his performance, so controlled that at the rare times that he lets go, it's just breathtaking to witness. His voice, a deep, grave rumble, takes a few minutes to get used to as it is quite different from his usual low-toned, sonorous baritone, but his eyes are so expressive and haunting. As I write this, the news that he has been nominated for an Emmy for this performance comes as no surprise. Parade's End is beautiful, but Cumberbatch is the real reason to watch it.<br /><br />Rebecca Hall also does a wonderful job as the spoiled socialite who knows exactly how to work men. She can make them do whatever she wants. Everyone falls under her spell. Everyone, of course, except her husband. It drives her completely mad that she can't get a rise out of him and she tries so very hard. She is a hard character to like or empathize with, but there are a few scenes where you can't really help but feel sorry for her. One scene you would swear she loathes Christopher, and another she is defending him to her lover as the last decent man in all of England. She admires his brilliance but mocks him for it. I don't think she quite knows how to behave around him. He can do no wrong and that infuriates her. But when she bares her soul for him (in a touching scene, albeit a short one) you really have to believe her and we get a glimpse at the passion that brought them together in the first place. They are an odd pair, mis-matched in so many ways, but you just can't help but want more of them.<br /><br />The cinematography is beautiful and vivid, from the posh London to the war-torn trenches and everything in between. Once again HBO has made a stunning mini-series and the production value is evident here.<br /><br />The one let-down has to be the character of Valentine Wannop, played by Adelaide Clemens. She is a sweet sort of girl, that Christopher accidently meets as a suffragette, and it's all secretive smiles and steamy stares from there. Her character felt lacking for me, and though I got a feeling of genuine affection from her towards Christopher, it still felt unrealistic, even towards the end. I can see the appeal, that she is so far removed from Sylvia that Christopher can't help but feel something for her. Where Sylvia is over-the-top, Valentine is modest and bland. But not so modest that she won't be his mistress, a task easier said than done. The final confrontation between Christopher, Sylvia and Valentine felt rushed, artificial, and well, unresolved. I was hoping for something rather grand, but it felt a bit flat.<br /><br />I would love to rewatch it some day, as I'm sure I missed some things, especially regarding the war, and the political aspects around it. This is one of these series that would definitely benefit from numerous viewings so you don't miss any of the nuances that make it so enjoyable to watch. Also, I believe this is the correct Blu-ray for the US and Canada, region 1. I noticed there were numerous versions of Parade's End on amazon, and it looks like people may have bough the wrong one. According to the specs, this looks to be the correct one.
1451627289|2.0|Stephen King, novel \\"11-22-63\\" - a Review<br />I enjoyed reading this novel thru the first 3/4 buildup - with the  hope that the most likely true assassins or plotters (LBJ, J Edgar Hover, CIA and MOB) of JFK's assassination  would be discovered and the 11/22/62 killing of JFK  be prevented.  Mr. King, during this buildup colorfully described life in terms of slang, fads, commercials, music and  events in late 1959, 1960, 1961, 1962 in the USA and  most specifically in Maine and Texas.  Also, Kings theme of \\"I have never been known as a crying man\\" cleverly repeated itself in his stories relating to first his ex-wife Christy, then to tragic events involving school janitor and adult ed student Harry Dunning,  12 year old Carolyn Poulin, and lastly the love of his re-invented life - Sadie Dunhill Clayton.  Kings novels last 1/4 ending was a severe disappointment however in that Lee Harvey Oswald was determined by King to be a wife abusing and pro Castro commie and lone nut assassin.  Even worse, Mr. King describes life after shooting Oswald on 11-2-63 and saving JFK as worse than it is presently in 2011.  Kings short description includes:<br />JFK Reelected 1964 (barely) against Goldwater, U.S. troups restricted to a Green Zone around Saigon,  no civil right reforms, race riots came next, Saigon in Tet offensive in 1967 fell to the communists, Harry Dunning was paralyzed in a helicopter crash, MLK was assassinated in Chicago by an FBI agent on Hoover's orders, Chicago and a dozen cities went up in flames, George Wallace in 1968 was elected president, earthquakes began in earnest, Wallace firebombs Chicago to stop quakes or rioting, Wallace drops hydrogen bomb on Hanoi in August 1969, with Gen Curtis LeMay in charge, George Wallace assassinated in May 1972 by Arthur Bremer with a .38 special revolver.  Herbert Humphrey became President in 1972.  Earthquakes worsen and suicide rate goes up, and terrorism by religious extremists blossoms. (India and Pakistan).  Ronald Reagan becomes President in 1976.  Jonestown, Guiana mass suicide of two thousand.  November 1979 Iranian students overran American embassy in Tehran and take not sixty six but over two hundred hostages.  Reagan sends in U.S. troops and hostages slaughtered.  Al-Qaeda arose and  began planting roadside bombs everywhere.  The  Mideast went up in flames.  Russia collapsed.  By 1994 the Oil fields were \\"black glass\\"(blown up with nuclear weapons).  Hillary Clinton elected President in 2004.  Maine voted to become part of Canada in 2005.  A suitcase nuke exploded in Miami in 2009.  Lack of energy and earthquakes and teen violence and widespread distrust of people and doom every where in 2011.<br />In short, King describes life after saving JFK in 1963 as far worse in 2011 then the present due to \\"the butterfly effect \\" of changing the past.  King then has the novel's main character, literature teacher, Jake Epping,  again go into the past (the rabbit hole) briefly and return to reset events and reverse all changes that resulted from his actions including the saving of JFK.  Also kings novel has the bad effect of reinforcing the notion that Oswald acted alone and helps coverup the more likely conclusion that LBJ and Hoover and Allen Dulles and the FBI and CIA were involved in planning the JFK assassinatin and in fact Oswald (who was likely  in Naval intelligence during his tour in the Marines and his near three years in the Soviet union) was a patsy who was in 1962-1963 working for the CIA and FBI.  Also, Oswald was having a coke in the second floor lunch area or nearby (in front watching the parade) at the time of the assassination at 12:30 on 11-22-63.
B00B9B4IYI|5.0|I just started subscribing to Google Play Music and needed some way to stream the music to my Yamaha RX-V773 (but it will work with any device that accepts a digital coax connection). I wanted a coax digital connection and the AptX codec. Setup was a breeze. I compared my HTC one that supports the codec and my Dell PC that does not. There is a substantial difference in the two - but it only became truly apparent when using the Pure Direct mode and was really noticable when I used it with an external DAC. I think digital coax sounds better (I know they are just ones and zeros - but jitter matters), but if you don't care or want optical instead, you might check out the NuForce BTR-100.
0812550706|5.0|This was the first sci-fi book I have ever read that caused me to suspend my disbelief. Very engaging, very impressive. It's a book that will change the way you think.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Just a really great movie. I don't know why I waited so long to see it. For sure a must see
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|great little game.  works well on my kindle.  had on my cell but switched to windows phone and not available yet.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I played part of level 1, and died. The game happily announced that if I had more points I could continue where I left off.<br />I would much prefer to pay $3 for a game, but not be nickel and dimed. Also Kindle got very warm while playing game.
B000NDIAWY|5.0|I did not know this artist.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It is a great CD, and I would definitely buy her music again.
1439170916|5.0|I'm still in the middle of reading this, but thus far, it's a great book! It was a required reading for all nursing students at my school, but I would recommend it to anyone. It does have some of the medical jargon in there (and yes, I've had to look some things/words up), but it really is a great read :)
B00821OX98|5.0|We have gotten hooked on the series and needed to go back to the beginning to fill in the blanks.  This is the only place we could find it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game......great puzzle for your mind!  I can't wait for new games to come out.  Really fun and challenging.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|This was a really good book.  It was a big surprise as it was our bookclub read, and I thought - oh dear - here's some angst for discussion.  But no.  It is clever, has nice twists and does not demean its subjects.<br />I enjoyed the ironic humour and the outrageous joy of episodes like the cocktail making session.<br />This is really just a love story with a nice twist and clever positioning.  But hey - isn't this life?<br />It works, and is seriously worth reading.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|I was unimpressed by this.  Still not sure how to use it. I believe I may have deleted this app.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Really fun game, very fast paced. Difficult without being frustrating. The levels are often pretty varied, making it feel fresh.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I ordered the Font Package because the &#34;Office Suite&#34; said it would be beneficial.  Come to find out it was designed to work with &#34;my Android,&#34; and I don't have an android.  For me it was worthless!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|Incredible story to sobriety and freedom from addiction. Thank God Anthony had the courage to quit and put into words for ME and hopefully many many other slaves to addiction. Read this and BE FREE. This was the second book I read..... Today is 421 days of freedom for me :-)

B000ICXQOM|3.0|A fun movie, but then I really like Bruce Campbell.  this is basically a sequel to the Evil Dead saga.  It is gross and action packed.  A good movie for the time it was made.

B009LDXQGW|5.0|He has the most unique sound of our generation and embodies the rapper mentality with a soulful crooner over eery beats.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is fun and easy to play, plus the dragons are adorable. Gameplay involves a lot of time things like growing food for your dragons, breeding, hatching and evolving your dragons.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Everyone has a story. You can't know that story  unless you listen with your heart.. take the time to know the people around you.
B00170M2OY|5.0|Though it's been 22 years since its release (wow, does time fly), this movie holds up just as well watching it with my own kids now as it did when I watched it as a 10-year-old for the first time. Dustin Hoffman gives one of the best character performances of his career, with some incredibly well-spoken and funny lines that keep me laughing long after the movie is over.<br /><br />\\"This is it. Don't try to stop me this time, Smee. Don't try to stop me this time, Smee. Don't you dare try to stop me this time, Smee, try to stop me. Smee, you'd better get up off your a**. Get over here, Smee!\\"<br /><br />Though it's one of my favorite lines of the whole movie, that above quote does bring up some points to be aware of. First, while this is a children's movie, it does carry a PG rating and there is some swearing in the movie. If you're the type who categories swearing into \\"major\\" and \\"minor\\" swear words, these would all be of the \\"minor\\" category, but they are there, nonetheless. There are also some darker plot themes here - kidnapping, murder, suicide, guns, sword fights, etc. That might sound bad written out like that, but it's no worse than the Looney Tunes episodes we grew up with. If there's such a thing as good ol' fashioned comedic shooting and sword fights, then Hook ranks among the best.<br /><br />I'd consider it a must-see for any fan of Peter Pan stories, kids of the 80's and 90's, parents of kids of the 80's and 90's, and Dustin Hoffman fans.<br /><br />Side note: Julia Roberts was only 24 when she made this movie. Feelin' old yet? Such a great Tinkerbell, though!

B009NQZVKG|5.0|Thrilling & suspense book. You keep turning pages to see what is happening next. I recommend this to those who like a good mystery
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|Fun, quick read left me wanting more. My 12 year old daughter and I enjoyed reading this and hope a sequel comes soon!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A movie for adults with wonderful actors portraying the various idiosyncrasies of aging with compassion and humor. And whatever Maggie Smith is in is a pleasure.
B008Y73940|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect with this movie but figured I would give it a try.  Ending up being more than I expecting! Great flick
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I loved every minute of this game.  Wasn't too easy or too difficult and I loved the graphics and sounds.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|Great actors in the movie but this was a little much for my liking.  I know very well what happened with slavery but some of these scenes were taken a bit too far for my taste.  This is one I would not watch again.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Truthfully, this is a review for the entire Wolves of Mercy Falls series. This series was the best series that I have ever read. I am a big Twilight fan and I like poetry, so this book was as good as made for me. I liked everything about the books and I wish that there were more books in this series in the process of being made. The relationship between Sam and Grace was so romantic and I hope that I have a relationship like that one day. I truly hope that these books end up having movies made. Coming from my heart, this really was the best series ever. I cried as the series came to its end. I would recommend this book to anyone who has a stomach for romance, action, science fiction, and poetry (which would be almost everyone). This series has earned a million star rating from me. Seriously, Maggie Stiefvater, thank you so much for writing these books. I hope to become an author myself one day. Read this series everyone, you will not regret it. &#60;3
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|arrived on time, but wasnt what I expected, it stated that it was 3d and digital copy but only the 3d copy was in the case.
B00DM0XXCM|3.0|Interesting movie, but I kept craning my head. It bugged me how part of the world was always seen as upside down. As a love story, the character's connection just wasn't there for me. I think it works much better as a fantasy or sci-fi.
B007Z9QP3K|5.0|FEELS LIKE I'M PLAYING SILENT HUNTER! THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE ABOUT SUBMARINES EVER MADE IN THE HISTORY OF THE PLANET! I LOVE THE BOAT AND THE LIFESTYLE OF THE 40S
B00DU74U74|3.0|I haven't read the book, so I have no preconceived ideas about how the story translates from page to screen. It did seem there's something missing, at least to me.<br /><br />That said, I love the idea of The Host. For the most part, I enjoyed the actors portraying the characters. I just didn't sense a lot of inexplicable passion, other than hatred, and this is supposed to be a love story--at least in part.<br /><br />It's different, it's interesting, but not exactly memorable.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Reads like a very modern Robinson Crusoe. The detail is phenomenal, although some readers may find it too much I loved it. Made it very real. I couldn't put this down. Well done Andy, more please!
B002ZG997M|5.0|This is one of the best film I have in Blu-ray, it worth each penny.<br />The film is excellent, and the Amazon delivery system works pretty nice.

1475143389|5.0|If you look like a Men's Health cover model, you probably know most of the information in this book already.  But this book is for the rest of us.  Forget all the stupid crap on TV and the internet about how you can look like said models by sitting on your couch and eating a magic pill or getting on the ground for 4 minutes a day.  That is all bogus junk.  If you really want to learn about fitness and how to obtain it, this should be your bible.<br /><br />Like I said, if you are already extremely fit, you don't need this book.  But 99% of America does.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|You will laugh, cry and fall in love with the relationship that develops between these two men who are worlds apart in how they were raised. Do not be put off by the subtitles. It doesn't even feel like you are reading and you do not miss a beat. This is SUCH a wonderful, true story. It has become an all-time favorite of everyone whom I have had watch it.  Buy this, you will soon be telling others the same exact thing. SIMPLY FABULOUS!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game. So fun. Defeated vector. Love the graphics. Funny when you poke their head and they yell &quot;ahhh!&quot; If you like the movie this game is for you.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Well written and easy to read.. Fantastic language and really hilarious at times. Maybe a bit prescriptive at the end.

B0036FOGTW|5.0|Sheds light on how the west is harming those in need.  For those that are into mission trips read this before you go. Warning it is written from an academic and economic point of view.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Enjoy the show a lot but sometimes it is hard to feel sympathy for the main character.  When she was trying to buy her old house but didn't have enough money... she probably has 4 times more money than most single mothers in this country.  But I still enjoy the show even if I can't always relate to their &#34;problems&#34;

B009346RSS|5.0|I have 2 pair of wireless headphone that are awesome.  However, they use component cables to connect to the audio out on our televisions.  After we upgraded to newer tv's we found out that many newer televisions are doing away with component audio out and relying exclusively on digital out.  This made our wireless headphones useless, until we found this device.  It works great, and saved us hundreds of dollars by not have to purchase new digital wireless headphones.

B008I6ZX1E|5.0|I read these books when they first came out - I have them all in paperback but I never managed to pick up &#34;A Dance With Dragons&#34;.  I loved the series.  I just recently started watching the show and it made me want to pick the books back up again - so many things I remembered and some I had forgotten.  Now while I wait for the next season I'm reading ahead to reacquaint myself with the story.  Looking forward to getting to the one I haven't read yet!<br /><br />These books were shipped looking exactly as pictured - New - in perfect condition.
1589269063|5.0|I have listened to this over and over again.  I have gained great insight on the topic, which has helped me improve my marriage and my relationship with my kids.  I highly recommend this.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I love Tintin and it reminds me of my youth actually, when I was reading all his adventures in cartoons. I used to listen to the radio movie as well at some point. Ah!!! the new generation will never understand this :-)<br />Well, it's a tintin and I rediscovered all I knew about him. Did not like though the 3D modelling. would have preferred the 2D cartoons.

1781162646|4.0|As usual with Stephen King's books, this was enjoyable, well written, suspenseful and spooky. If you like Stephen King, you'll like it. The characters are interesting, and the descriptions of the amusement park and surrounding town will make you feel like you are there.<br /><br />However, the cover and the description (and the fact that it's pubbed by Hard Case Crime) are misleading. I expected a Noir-style mystery infused with some gory ghostly paranormal elements. It's not. Taking place in the early 70s, from the point of view of a college kid working at an amusement park, it's anything but traditional Noir or gumshoe mystery. That doesn't mean it isn't enjoyable, with enough of a murder mystery to keep Hard Case Crime readers interested.<br /><br />Opinion only: Cons: The paranormal (ghosts and clairvoyance) aspects were not as intense as I would have liked. Having a kid with \\"the sight\\" was pretty close to The Shining, which is ok, but I would have liked it more if it had taken a darker turn. Again, I was expecting a combination of Stephen King and Raymond Chandler, which this is not.<br /><br />Pros: The main character is extremely vivid and real, and easy to connect with. The other characters are really well formed and enjoyable, and add a lot to the story. The story itself is very original and the mystery will keep you guessing until the end. If you're looking for a murder mystery with a paranormal twist, you should thoroughly enjoy this book.<br /><br />-Christopher Pinto<br />author of The Bill Riggins Paranormal Mystery Series<br />[[ASIN:B00COMM3IO Murder Under the Boards: The Atlantic City Paranormal Mystery featuring Detective Bill Riggins (Detective Bill Riggins Mysteries)]]
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is an entertaining alternative to subway surfers and temple run! You should totally get it  because even if you don't like it, it's free! The only bad thing about the game is the fact that if you touch something slightly it will do any command that you touch. I had a bad experience with this when I accidentally touched the screen with my wrist and wasted 35 gru tokens. Besides that, the game is actually really fun! Ps, I was not bribed to write this<br />.

This book was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to generate money for Marvel. Did it succeed in this goal? Sure - in spades! Is it a fun book? Yes. Does it have great artwork? Sure! Is it a compelling and thought provoking story? No way!<br /><br />Frankly, it would have been some kind of miracle if the large cast of writers on this book would have been able to come up with a real interesting story for this cash cow. There really isn't any good reason for Marvel's heroes to try and beat the tar out of one another. There once was (remember [[ASIN:0785121781 Civil War]]? [[ASIN:0785149171 Secret Invasion]]?), but now it just really feels contrived and forced. Yes, there is some semblance of an underlying story, here, but it just really doesn't make much sense that \\"Earth's Mightiest Heroes\\" don't have the sense enough to sit down and work things out in a rational way rather than leap into destructive conflict. Isn't that the whole reason that Captain America told his allies to stand down in the conclusion of Civil War? I thought he wanted to avoid unnecessary destruction, bloodshed and public animosity. This conflict between the two sides just doesn't ring true, at all.<br /><br />On the plus side, you have all the biggest stars of the Marvel universe fighting one another in beautifully-illustrated pictures. The art on the book is great. The action is robust. The hero-VS-hero fights are fun to see. It all just makes little sense. If you can get past that, you'll enjoy what is left over.<br /><br />A few other things worth noting:<br />1. This book collects the main mini-series in chronological order, but all of the other material is collected at the end of the book, separately, rather than inserted into the story, proper, to flesh it out. Maybe you'll like this sort of format, and maybe you won't. To me, it felt a bit like eating a whole meal, and then realizing there was a plate of dinner rolls and a dish of green beans that were forgotten and not brought out until the table was being cleared. I can't help but think that there could have been a better way to organize the book. Oh well. Nothing to be done about it, now.<br />2. This book contains a code for a download of a digital copy of the book through the Marvel Comics app on Apple IOS devices or Android devices. You can get these apps for free, but you should be aware that the code has a limited time window for use. It is good for one year from the release date of the book, which means you have until November of 2013 to use the code. After that point in time, you've missed the boat. Keep this in mind when ordering this book, as I'm sure some of the book's inflated cost was defended by the publisher on account of this \\"freebie\\" that they included.<br /><br />Most Marvel fans will probably enjoy this book, even though there's nothing groundbreaking in it. That is, unless you consider...<br /><br />(Spoiler Ahead!)<br /><br />...the elimination of the Phoenix Force from the Marvel universe any sort of big deal.<br /><br />Seriously? So the Scarlett Witch can really do just about anything she wants to with her crazy, undefined power?

B008TRUDAS|1.0|I'm not sure if this book was suppose to be a teen book. It if was then it would be an ok book. I found the writing to be stupid. How many times can each character roll their eyes. The story and dialog was boring and predicable. I am sure that I will never read another book by Colleen Hoover. Sorry

B000E41MS6|5.0|As time goes on this first season of Doctor Who becomes better and better in relation to the later story arcs. I recently was asked to rate the finales on each series 1-8 and I found that this was the best finale of any year. Considering I am a huge fan of David Tennant, that is saying something. Eccleston gives us a Doctor who straddles the old and new in Doctor Who. He is a very mysterious and mercurial figure and, yet, he has an emotional attachment to Rose. This was a new concept outside of fandom and the books at the time of this series, and it broke radical and, still relevant ground. Everyone involved in this first series is responsible for introducing Doctor Who to a whole new generation. If it hadn't been so very good, it never would have continued. So, if you've been waiting to see what Doctor Who is all about...grab this series, rather than just tuning in to the latest episode. But I will warn you, that once you fall in love with Nine and Rose in S1, it will be hard to move on to anyone else as Doctor or Companion.
1608871827|5.0|i'm an avid collector of \\"art of...\\" books and this one is up there with the best. a lot of these books will have some bits of concept, a little production information and maybe a render or two of hero pieces with a bunch of stills from the movie and glamour shots of the actors. for example, the low bar is the \\"art of world war z\\" which is quite literally the screen play with movie stills. this book has a bit of EVERYTHING (great concept work, 3d renders, production notes, behind-the-scenes shots) plus some you don't expect (propoganda posters and stickers ???!!!??!). i get the feeling del toro, who is a lover of movies and film memorabilia, had a lot to do with the construction of this book. worth every penny and all my 5 stars!!
B00CF2UORK|5.0|Love the details and the characters. The animation is terrific. Perfect for fans of the Wallace and Grommit cartoon series.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game....can be addicting. I like that it can be played without WiFi connection. Makes you think about placement and profits per hour.
0812982622|5.0|We always knew things were bad there, just not this bad.  Johnson puts a face to the average North Korean, and his view of life, strange as it is.  Beautifully written, with images you will never forget.  Enjoyed every bit of it!
B002KLOPF8|5.0|This movie will haunt your dreams.  Very well acted and extremely sensitive.  You will cry in your popcorn. This movie is a must for those who love military drama!
B006FE83UE|5.0|What can you say about this movie that hasn't already been said.  It is 50 years old but just as good now as then.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love this show can't wait for next season..But I hope its better than season 3 but i still love it.
B0068FZ1EG|5.0|If you never saw this one, it is a great movie.  It is one you will enjoy watching over and over.
006178480X|5.0|What can I say?  James Rollins is tied with another thriller writer (Steve Berry) as my favorite author.  I particularly love his Sigma Force series.  This is the ninth book in that series and it does not disappoint!<br /><br />Present Day Los Angeles:  Two satellites high in the heavens are tracking the progress of a comet designated IKON and thought to have previously appeared in Earth's orbit hundreds of years ago.  A physics experiment regarding space/time, dark energy and the comet itself, headed by physicist Dr. Jada Shaw, has been classified as a black operation and therefore is under the command of DARPA and Sigma Force.  The program has been dubbed IoG (or Eye of God).  As Dr. Shaw and her team monitor the progress of the comet, suddenly one of the satellites spins out of control out into space while the other crashes to earth.  In a final transmission burst before losing the signal of the second satellite, a picture is received...a picture of the entire East Coast of the United States in smoky, smouldering ruins.<br /><br />In Italy, at the Vatican, Monsignor Vigor Verona, the head of Pontifical ancient studies, receives a mysterious package from a friend and priest thought long dead.  Together with his niece, Rachel, a member of the Italian Carabinieri (police), they set out to discover the significance of the strange package...the contents of which seem to hold a clue to a dire apocalyptic prophesy.  They begin a journey that will set them along the same path as the members of the Sigma Force who are attempting to retrieve the crashed Eye of God satellite.<br /><br />From Los Angeles to Macau, North Korea, Rome, Kazakhstan, China, Russia, Mongolia and beyond, both teams race to retrieve two items...items that, if not retrieved in time, could possibly cause the destruction of the Earth.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is James Rollins' best Sigma Force novel yet!  I read it a bit slower than usual because I went back and re-read entire chapters to be sure I was able to process and understand the science and history involved...and this book is chock full of both.  This is a hallmark of Mr. Rollins' work...a combination of cutting-edge science, history and just enough science fiction/speculation (that is close to being science fact) to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I wanted to race through it and finish it in one night but I knew that wouldn't do the book justice but oh how I hated putting it down every night.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with Mr. Rollins' work and want to read his Sigma Force novels, I would suggest that you read them in order.  (The first is Sandstorm.)  He has written 21 novels in total and (in my decidedly-biased opinion) they are all excellent.  Kudos to James Rollins for another fantastic read!I was able to process and understand the science and history involved...and this book is chock full of both.

B00CH87HF4|3.0|Ok...so, first off I really enjoyed the idea and some of the mechanics of this game.  It has a good Diablo feel about it.  Combat is easy, and fun.  The directional pad works good.<br /><br />Now for the bad.  In my opinion, all of the real money aspects of the game take away from the overall feel.  In order to upgrade weapons, buy new gear, even to buy health potions, you need gems.  Pretty much the only way to get gems us to buy them.  Yes you can get them through the wheel of fate, but to use it you need more gems.  This takes a good, possibly very good game, and makes average to mediocre.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|i haven't been on facebook in months..came back and don't understand it AT ALL!  I don't want to build up a friends thing..just need it sometimes for dailly life, as you know...commercials say &#34;like us on facebook&#34; and get a coupon...  play word game with friends, etc....  i have no desire to know when everyone makes hamburgers for dinner or farts after it!  so stop pushing it on me!
B009RWRIZ2|5.0|I ordered the blu ray version of this a year ago, then foolishly opted for the European 3D version in expectation that I might somehow make it work in my region.  Frustrated in that attempt I could only wait  and repeatedly view my blu ray copy.<br /><br />Now I've gotten the 3D version which approaches the theatrical one and I can only say: if you love dance and have 3D capability - get this treasure. The dancers in her company and their guests pay Pina Bausch a dazzling, loving tribute.
B0022CY8WK|4.0|I really enjoy this film, Chicago. It has a superb cast. They are all excellent singers on their own right but put them together and wow.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Hey, it's a solitaire game. Not much difference from many others. I have played worse. One annoying thing is the pop-up after you start a new game.  Other then that it's a way to kill time.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|sucks! i can't control anything on this app! everytime I try to make the hair to look nice i epicly fail. this app is horrible!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed!  Was well written and a quick read.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about the heroism of our special forces.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Total classic. Well done movie. If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you've seen it before, watch it again.
B000IZ4R1U|5.0|Great action flick!  Perfect to watch while running on the treadmill and imagine you are kicking the bad guys' butts!
B004JMZPJG|5.0|There is only one word to describe this case, AMAZING! it has so many pockets to keep all your camera stuff organized and accessible. i love this product.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Before I read it I watched the movie, I did like it. My favorite part was when Katness met Cinna
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Unveiling of the story through many characters. A captivating and interesting read. A definite page-turner! I would definitely recommend it to the reader looking for a great story and learning some history .
0385349947|5.0|Although written with the working woman in mind,  most of Sheryl tips are applicable to all woman.  For those of us in work-a-day world, her perpective is very valid.  I will give my copy to my daughter when I ready to let it go.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|We were looking for a show to watch and The Good Wife was recommended by a friend. We look forward to watching an episode each evening.
0307476073|5.0|A good bookclub choice.  Interesting to be a part of Cheryl's journey on the PCT.  Nice read and I was always ready for the next chapter.  Cheryl whines a bit in the beginning but as she grows stronger her attitude and outlook improves greatly, as it would for most of us attempting to do what she did.  It was a life changing event for her and that shows clearly in her writing.
B003VANOFY|2.0|They were fine while they worked, but after about a year of use they started to fall apart. The drivers along with being very poor quality quickly started to have lots of distortion making the headphones unusable.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Who doesn't like a good horror classic?  I have enjoyed it very much.  Great for a Friday night with the family.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This is a great game for all ages. Once you get the hang of the controls. It's a lot of fun
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love this show so much.  I needed a new series to catch up on with my Roku and this is fab.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is lots of fun and very hard to stop playing.  The whole family is sharing - well more like arguing over who plays next.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|kept me busy but wasn't impossible. I liked it. played all 10 levels. a good game to kill the boredom. thumbs up.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|My husband and I originally watched this on cable and loved it so much, we wanted our own copy, so when it became available, it was a given we would purchase it.  I can't wait to watch it again.
B00AHG9KYE|5.0|There will never be another Arthur c. Clark . The descriptions of the technology is great everything in the book could be possible someday.
0802473156|5.0|I purchased this book 4 years ago, after being married for 1 year. We needed help.<br />I didn't complete it. But put it to the side. I then gave it to a couple that was in trouble.<br />This year, I purchased another copy and read it and began to apply the principles.<br />It is working. My husband is now even reading it. I would read this along with<br />&#34;Love and Respect&#34; by Dr. Emerson Eggerichs- which is an excellent read!!!!
B007NZ7LIY|5.0|WOW,,,, when I saw this in the app store I was ummm this looks like something from my past cause I played it on the SNES at the time as a kid but it was call 'out of this world' well let me say that once I looked and read up on it I was shocked this was like a top notch game with out the graphics and story at the time, I remember watching my brother play it saying yo this is that game everyone's taking about and somehow they got it to play on SNES .back then it was like a movie to me and the game was just graphic Lee next gen stuff. I just stared playing it now and I get that great feeling again plus it's real done HD!! Can't believe I ever would see this classic fan cult type game again to play but yesss I can.. to the people that know this game yous know what I mean and to new comers u will love it ,it's worth for the experience!!!!!!
0439023513|5.0|Excellent ending!  It has several plots and twists.  We see Katniss after just ending the Quarter Quell from Book 2, she is rescued by the rebels in 13...but not Peeta.  In this installation she fully embraces the revolution, helping the cause and even joining in the fight when she can.  District 12 was destroyed by the Capital, save a select few that Gale was able to rescue  Peeta, meanwhile is at the Capitol getting brainwashed against Katniss so that when they meet again all he wants to do is kill her.  Gale is with Katniss in District 13 helping wholeheartedly with the cause.<br />The ending was really sad and happy at the same time.  Most series usually dissapoint me with their ending, this one did NOT!  I think those that didn't like it just didn't understand.  I don't think the author was going for your traditional happily ever after, she wanted to show how imperfect we are, how we never really seem to learn from our mistakes, yet she still left a glimmer of hope at the end, in my opition, with how the State ended up.<br />Read it!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I really like this app, especially at work.  I can check the weather and the radar before I go outside.  I work in a basement with no windows.  We literally have to go outside to check the weather.  This makes it much more convenient.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is one outstanding app! Definitely worth much more than it costs. I use it every day. I love how it breaks everything down for you.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|Good solid read , keeps you guessing on what's coming next. This is the first book I've read by Rachel Joyce.  I will definitely look for any of her other books.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|Wandering around at Seattle's Bumbershoot festival in, was it 2005?... I heard a band playing that sounded for all the world like Cream with a vocalist that could only have been an elderly black blues man. Imagine my surprise when I turned the corner and saw two young skinny white guys cranking out classic sounds with tons and tons of soul, grit, and real feeling. I stood transfixed as the crowd swayed rhythmically to that slow drumbeat and dirty, crunchy, amazingly rich guitar, and the Black Keys just blew us all away. I immediately bought a Thickfreakness CD from a table near the stage and have been amazed at these guys ever since. Love, love, love the Black Keys.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Fantastic game. Never gets old. Add me... my storm ID is itslizyall68<br /><br />I love choosing what dishes to cook... and designing my restaurant.
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Pretty good story line - but as most action movies go - not realistic - but it certainly holds your interest.  Arnold was vintage &#34;Arnold&#34; in this one - good to see it.  Not too long - pretty much action all the way.  Worth seeing.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is one of the best concepts ever. I have made many notebooks and I simply could not live without this app... I would suggest it to anyone!!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Makes it easy to read one of my books if I am sitting around waiting without my Kindle. Thanks for Free the App
B008JFLWLE|4.0|I think this calculator is fantastic... however I wish there was a way to solve algebra problems... But overall it's a very nice calculator. I especially like that I can just write out the math problem instead of typing it in...
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game really makes you think. Best of the three similar that I have played. My request would be for there to be more levels. :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book is so upsetting-mostly because it ended! I miss the characters already! Really hope E L James comes up with more awesome books!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|My daughter's book club read this and she loved it.  It was everything and more that she said about it.<br /><br />I have 2 grandchildren with special needs and I worry about how other kids will treat them.  It was so helpful to read how Augie and his familie's courage gave Augie a much richer life.<br /><br />I found myself wishing I had been more kind as a child to people who were different.  I loved how the writer kept you interested by having each character give their own story.<br /><br />I want my grandson who is 12 to read this book.  He has a sister who was born with Down syndrome.  I think he will enjoy Augie's story
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci tells a good story  .The plot changes make you want to read on .I like Will Robie.Iwill read his next book
B0086700CM|5.0|Neat little game!!!! keeps you going for hours and keeps you coming back for more.  Play it while I am traveling
B003TOMAPC|5.0|A fun action movie to escape with, not for the younger crowd as its filled with comic book violence and since it came from a comic thats just fine,.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Keeps you busy for hours. It is one of the cutest games around, for free, how can you loose.  Try it !!
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie grows on you each time you watch it. Just hilarious. I don't like all of the movies with Will Ferrell, but this one is exceptional.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was just amazing! I read it in 2 days!!! Suzanne Collins is an amazing author. #TeamPeeta all the way!!!!!!!!!!!!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love these books - in part because they are not syrupy and silly, and the characters are interesting and not totally predictable (like so much YA lit). This series is &#34;Harry Potter&#34; good - aimed at a slightly older group, and far superior to Twilight. Not quite as dark as Hunger Games or Divergent, but just as good, I think.
B00992CF6W|5.0|One of the best apps I've ever bought totally worth the $7 the only thing that could make it better is if they would hurry up with the next update my friend's minecraft already got updated on her iPad (0.7.2 minecraft version) and its been a while since hers updated but still it is an amazing game Keep Up The Good Work Mojang!!!!!!!!!!!!
B008220BLG|5.0|This is a wonderful movie, very good.  This is a type of Romeo & Juliet story.  I really enjoyed it.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This is a classic Disney film and I would recommend it to those who enjoy them.  We bought this one to update the format from the VHS copy we bought when our children were young.
B00BURWSG6|5.0|There have been a number of new releases by symphonic metal groups.<br />This one is the best overall! Timo Tolkki is a fantastic guitarist and composer.<br />There are many great artists that make this epic a masterpiece!<br />This is the beginning of a trilogy.<br />I highly recommend it!<br />For those who are unaware Who Timo is, he has been guitarist and singer<br />of many Stratovarius releases before his solo career.<br />I love epic symphonic metal!<br />This begins a promising chapter in this genre.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is a classic Disney film and I would recommend it to those who enjoy them.  We bought this one to update the format from the VHS copy we bought when our children were young.
B00005JLPK|5.0|This movie was great.  We loved it and are happy to add this to our collection.  The price was also great and we received it quickly.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|The movie is one of my favorites for Christmas. The case is still in good order and the shipping was prompt. The DVD is pristine.
1781164266|5.0|This book takes you deep into the world of Dead Space.  I really can not speak highly enough about the quality of the art and the book materials used to print on.  If you are a fan this is a must have.
B001ANSSDC|1.0|So simplistic.  Right from the get go this is a predictable story for sports fans.  A waste of two hours!
B00A27X972|5.0|Beautifully written.  Difficult to put down.  Makes you want to be a better human and gives you a good idea of what that might mean without lecturing you about it.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I loved it!! His voice is just so awesome to listen too!! I think any fan would enjoy it as much as I do...or anyone for that matter!!!
B0001MLMKY|1.0|This watch is so small that no man would wear it. Don't buy this watch if you are a man.
030726999X|5.0|I really like all three books.  The author makes it seem like this might have really happened and he is just writing it changing the names to protect the innocent.
B001ANSSDC|2.0|Not sure why this book has such high ratings! Boring and pointless!!! Waste if my time and money! Bad, bad and more bad!
B0000067L3|5.0|Who does not love Eric Clapton  ... early days of great guitar playing /innovation /Jack Bruce's distinctive wanton voice ... The Politician.. &#34;come on babeeeee, get into my big black car.&#34;  Ginger Baker using the drums to play a true melody... come on .. one of the greatest bands evah.  !
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|I really liked this season a lot, and wish it would continue on forever.  I have watched it several times so far, and will watch it again.
B000SP3DE2|5.0|Gary Oldham  is a great actor .. period.  One of the finer dracula pictures out there .. believable.<br /><br />Artistry in production personified.
1451627289|5.0|I have been a King fan forever.  This is one of the best books I've read. I didn't want to put it down and could relate to everything as it changed.  Love the butterfly effect.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've used both accuweather and weather.com apps for over a year and accuweather is my go-to app. It's quick and easy and it doesn't take forever for the maps to load like weather.com does.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My Grand daughter loves it. she plays it all the time,.She thinks she is a hair dresser and truly loves it
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoyed the three books immensely, not sure what was the hook Lisbeth and Mikael surely but was style of writing or the story worth a 4 even a 5 I think so I have read the series twice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It makes me feel like I'm on the edge of my seat, and the kids I babysit love it they can never get enough of the little minions. When they play they're faces just light up.
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|I bought this stickers for my daughters birthday and she loved them. She loves her room decorated all by herself
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is like temple run but I like like this game it is fun and I like the victor challenge
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This was the most best game I played so far maybe I will give it a 4 out of 5!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a fun app to play however some of the items are too overpriced. But other than that, it is wonderful and super fun to play
B0042FZOFU|4.0|A wonderful collect added to my blu-ray pile. It is definitely different having Blu-ray Disc compared to regular DVD discs. This is a must-have if you are a Pixar fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Downloaded for our grand-daughters..they love taking turns getting to the next levels.  Great entertainment for us to watch them manuver thru the obstacles.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|This app would get a 5 star if it didn't hang up after using it for several minutes. It just won't save your art work.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|tHIS IS THE BEST SHOW EVER,QUALITY WAS FANTASTIC. cAN NOT WAIT INTILL THE SHOW STARTS AGAIN. lOVE THE ARTISTS, LOVE THE STORY LINE
B0089LOG02|5.0|Loved this book and would recommend to everyone. Beautifully wriitten and all of my friends who've read it have enjoyed it too.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|The book has been around for a very long time, so there were no surprises left in the story.  I have always been impressed with Agatha Christie's story telling.  Re-reading the book was like visiting an old friend.  It was warm and fuzzy and I recommend it as a great way to spend a quiet evening.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I Loved This Movie. It's Slow At Times But I Am Actually Glad To The Attention To Detail. Can't Wait For The Next Movies.
B008BQ8VOC|3.0|This show is okay, smart, but not too engaging.  Cast is okay, stories are okay, no depth.  It's good to fall asleep to at night.  You don't much care if you miss parts of it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a very good book. Rick has outdone himself this time. I've never been on the edge of my chair more!!!!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|I am ten and I love this book, though slightly disturbing, it is excellent an it should be read by teens and Tweens everywhere.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great graphics, cute characters, fun power-ups, good action, challenging without being TOO hard... enjoyable to play with friends; the best game I have downloaded in a long time
B000FS9FCG|5.0|I like Natalie since her first move Leon with Jean Reno, little bit disapoitment in Star wars,but this move is touching your heart. But not only Natalie ,the story of this move is revolutionary and it can open many eyes ...Recoment to everyone ,who wants to know .....
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|So many damn ads that freezes the game. However, the game is fun to play. If only there were less pop ups.
B0035V35P8|5.0|one of the best Ninja move , choreography, battle scene ,story was perfekt made, I enjoy watsching it, I can recomend to everyone who loves this kind of move!
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|I must say ive been a Phil fan since 1992 and own everything album he has released.. seen all of his bands live!! \\"walk through exits only\\" for me was the most anticapated album since pantera's \\"reiventing the steel\\" in 2000.. man this album does not disapoint !!!!run out and BUY IT NOW!!!!! album of the year 2013 .... its very very worth buying for any pantera,superjoint ritual,down,arson anthem fan ....GO BUY RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I really enjoyed this film and I recommend it to other adults.<br />The language was bothersome at times, but other than that, was well acted.<br />Stereotypes were much in evidence and played out well in the telling of the story.<br />Have seen this  3 or 4 times now.<br /><br />If you have a sense of humor and are not too thin-skinned, then you might well enjoy this.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is the first time I have ever left a review for a book if that tells you anything.  I have liked many books, but I loved this one!  I was on a roller coaster of emotions and I loved every minute of it.  I will cherish the insight of viewing life from someone whose losing their own.  I wanted to highlight so many things in this story and I have never done that before.  The best one is definitely \\" the world is not a wish-granting factory.\\" Feeling so blessed to have stumbled upon this book. Everyone should read this book!
B004SDSSFY|5.0|Now my android can do what a PC can do.  I have been waiting for this for quite awhile.  Thanks
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Very enjoyable. I've seen the original and do feel it's better. The original was about a wealthy public servant and therefore had a bigger impact when he did sleazy things, in this version Spacey plays a sleazy southerner ergo not so surprising when he does sleazy things. Great performances especially by Spacey and Robin Wright (she's really good and I think her character is going to be the one with the surprises). Highly recommend.
B004SDEP38|5.0|Makes my android have all that a PC has.  It is what I have been hoping for.  It is a great product.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a great way to spend my free time.  The levels are not too difficult but they do make you think.  Can't wait for more levels to open up.  I don't like that I have to wait for this.  That is the only downside
B0085CV0TA|4.0|Sahara is a shiny big budget picture taken from the Clive Cussler \\"Dirk Pitt\\" novels. Overall I think the budget is what killed it with the studio. With less money and media hype the movie would have had a shot. The performances are consistent and entertaining. Steve Zahn nails many aspects of the Al Giordino character, William H Macy is Jim Sandecker and Matthew McConaughey is probably the weakest like but still makes Dirk Pitt rougish and likeable.<br /><br />When budgets are large people often forget some movies are just supposed to be fun. This film is not art but is a film worth watching and it doomed the other books in the series like Iceberg, Inca Gold and Atlantis Found which would have translated well to the big screen.
B000089RV6|5.0|I love this album and wish I bought it years ago, it's terrific classic hard rock.  I would recommend it for sure.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|.Fun. Good game to kill time.  Thanks for asking.  Need more coins to play though.  Free is still not free.
0316069434|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my son-in-law.  He started reading it right away and seemed to enjoy it, so I have to recommend it.  I did not read it myself.
B000G9YQ7I|5.0|I got this for a friend's birthday present and this was exactly what she wanted and I was looking to get for her.
B003U69IX6|4.0|Generally speaking, it was a good adaptation of the book. Some things were missing and/or  changed, but it was still enjoyable and entertaining. I enjoyed watching it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Can't put this game down. Always thinking of ways to find the things that are needed to ESCAPE, and how to use them. The graphics are so real. The floors are all different and new ways to go on to the next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I honestly don't think it could get any better. It is way better than temple run! Great game, and I would recommend this to anyone. Its great for kids and adults of any age.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A great read, I really enjoyed it. Good story & great characters.  Really makes you want to read the others in the series.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|Whenever my facebook photo changes it doesnt on this game even after unlink and relink it. And i have an old photo of me from awhile back that i would like to change. I usually play music while playing games. When i goto to turn game music off it turns down my music too. Other than those its not a bad game. When those are fixed my rate goes up.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|GREAT WAY TO PASS SOME TIME AND HAVE FUN WITH SO MANY OTHERS ALONG THE WAY.  GREAT TIME RESPONSE DURING GAMEPLAY.<br />Highly suggested download. Addictive.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Action packed good special effects. I thought this was just another knock off movie but I really enjoyed it would recommend to all scifi lovers.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is by far the most hardcore gaming experience that any of the game developers for the android operating system have managed to pull off. It is by far the most addictive game I have played on the kindle since I got one for my family, I cant recall the last time I have read a book with the kindle. The developers did an amazing job with this franchise, and I am looking forward to seeing what the developers do next with the series. I give Modern Combat 4 a 5/5 for being the best first person shooter I have played on the kindle.
B007RI56NY|5.0|This is an incredible album. It has some wacky lyrics but its so fun! You definitely will not be disappointed if you purchase.

B0013ND30M|3.0|dvd's were great. good quality. but the outside of of the dvd case was a bit damaged (the cardboard bit). a little disappointed with this. thought would be brand new with no damage.
B000SP1SEO|3.0|Snatch is close to a carbon copy of Guy Ritchies' earlier movie Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels. It has the same frenetic, engaging style and leaves many of us trying to figure out who's teamed up with whom and why should any of us care? A bunch of low lives battle over who gets the big, stolen diamond and most of the main figures don't seem to make it to the end of the film, them being dead and everything. How they got this far in life without being eliminated so much earlier is not sufficiently explained. The film definitely has a comic flair and will delight any film goer who loved the scene in Pulp Fiction where the person in the back seat got their head vaporized by accident (if I remember correctly) by a guy in the front seat. What a laugh riot that was for the teenagers in front of me at the time. If they haven't sufficiently matured, they'd love many of the scenes here.<br /><br />Luckily I took advantage of the subtitles so I could decipher much of the dialogue, particularly Brad Pitt's. (Pitt has the best role in the show, someone who is positively moral compared to the rest of the human dregs, though incomprehensible. Not in his aims; it's just that no one in the film or the audience can understand this Irish gypsy's garbled gibberish. But somehow the subtitles lady/guy did.) The unfortunate side effect of this gift from the filmakers was that I read most of the movie and was always a half second behind the actual action -- not because I'm a slow reader; it's just that the titles were a wee bit tardy. The director's strategy seems aimed at the attention deficit crowd. There's never more than a few minutes before someone is getting knocked out, crammed into a car boot, having his dead arm chopped off, running their car into a light pole, or shown spread-eagled in mid-air in ultra slow motion, hair and sweat flying, after being nuked in a boxing match (only to come back and knock out the bad guy. Natch!)<br /><br />I have no argument with the acting. Overall, it was scary and appropriate. It's fun to laugh at really stupid people doing stupid things, but every one of those people here can back up their idiocy with firepower. Luckily -- hopefully? -- they don't inhabit your real world. Pitt's performance made me smile throughout. It's apparent he was having a good time with his role. But midway (or earlier), I was wondering who I was supposed to care about or identify with or even want to watch for very long. If your idea of a good time is to watch a morbidly obese getaway guy getting stuck trying to get out of his own car -- get the irony there? -- you'll like this movie. (I did like that clip.) If you're into clowns with huge guns mowing down other knuckle-draggers, you'll like this movie. (For me, that grew really tiresome.) In summary, it's a comic book of a movie. Colorful (but not in its camera work -- the film is set primarily in dingy locales -- fast-paced, perversely funny, derivative, memorable for certain scenes/characters, but ultimately a \\"Meh.\\"verall, it was scary and appropriate.

B008XJ8WE6|4.0|The Blu Ray is a lot better than the DVD y HOWEVER you still have an issue with the sound but make no mistake, it does sound better.  If you want to own Joseph, go Blu-Ray.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Before watching this engaging documentary, I had no idea of the extent of natural gas drilling in the United States or the potential risk of the technology being used.  Everyone should watch this film.
B000UAFDP2|3.0|but Sony really screwed the pooch when issuing this blu-ray. Picture, sound, bonus material was awesome, however..YOU NEED A USB FLASH DRIVE plugged into your Blu-ray player so that it can download some info (don't try to get around it, already did and failed).
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Simply one of the best programs we've seen!! Can't wait for the new season! We highly recommend this or any of the other seasons!

B005LAII08|5.0|Not much to say about the product, as it's excellent in great packaging and shipped quickly.  The film itself is great, but I don't have time to write a full review of the movie.

B00006RCNJ|1.0|This disk will only play on DVD players sold outside the USA which was not stated by the seller and therefore is useless and an obviously bad investment.  This seller should be forthwith regarding this fact.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This book is amazing! I fell in love with Gideon and Eva's story in the first book of the series, and just like the others, its addicting! Couldn't put this down!

B0002OXVDW|5.0|I love the older movie songs.  The set has four disks. It contains many stars who were not singers by nature. My favorite is Jimmy Stewart singing. I did not know that four DVDs had been issued. I pain $18 for the set .

B0064W652A|5.0|I've always been a fan of the comics that explore Batman`s personal life. Bringing in a childhood friend of Bruce`s and presenting Catwoman as a badass love interest was masterful storytelling. And the villain was of course awesome because Loeb wrote it. Everything was believable and engrossing. Loved it.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I originally bought this book hoping that it would give me a few useful recipes. Once I started reading though I found that this book is much more than just a cookbook. This book was not only entertaining but very informative of the processes of fermentation and many other cooking actions. Having recently made my own bread, I became further informed of  the cellular reactions taking place to make dough rising possible. This book was altogether wonderful, so for anyone who is on the fence about purchasing this book, it is definitely worth your money.

1451627297|5.0|This is my favorite Stephen King book, and I love Stephen King!  It's a long read, but so worth it...I found myself slowing down the closer I got to the end so it would last longer.  King makes you feel as if you were there, and I couldn't get enough of Jake/George and Sadie.  I actually finished the book, and then reread it immediately.  You will love this even if you are not a King fan...I guarantee it.
B0093Q8W0C|5.0|A must see from Hitch. Cary Grant and Eve Marie Saint steam up the movie while a case of mistaken identity leads to a wild adventure.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|Over-the-top ,a most unusually lovely musical love story with profound comical and tragic moments.<br />The twisted, highly charged Tango version of \\"Roxanne\\", simply has to be the best interpretation of a great song.<br />Both Nicole Kidman n Ewan Mcgregor are greatly convincing; their singing voices are also amazingly tender and moving.
031603438X|5.0|I've met Keith a few times and he is a REAL GUY, totally amazing and generous. He loves music and is so uber supportive helping other musicians.<br />I had anticipated reading this book and was so happy it captures his essence 100%. He is a genuine artist through and through and an awesome human being. Love him, his extraordinary writing and playing and this book.
B009V3KKXY|5.0|I bought this book for the primary purpose of learning how to tie paracord bracelets.  One the features that I found the most helpful to a beginner like myself was the use of pictures correlated to specific step by step instructions.  The author utilized contrasting colors of paracords to help you visualize the instructional steps.  I also like the section of the book devoted to paracord supplies and suppliers via the Internet.  This was helpful because there aren't a lot of craft stores, etc. that carry paracord supplies.  There are tons of cool colors and options for paracord bracelets.  This book and the resources provided allow the reader a great tool for exploring paracord possibilities.  I can't wait for another book from the author about this topic.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is a fun, realistic game. I enjoyed it very much, but the game was slow. It takes a long time to compete, level up, earn gems and coins, and to buy things that are expensive. On the other hand, it is easier to get gems for free.

B000SEJHRA|4.0|Monsieur Sedaris' books are always entertaining and choke full of amusing stories.  He can wring empathy from his readers even as he admits that he's morally handicapped. He's audacious and clever and this book expresses those qualities. Good reading times.

B001BANK32|4.0|Re-read this book in anticipation of 'Dr. Sleep' and holy poop on a stick is this book scary.<br /><br />I had read it years ago and during the intervening years watched the Kubrick film countless times. Since I had forgotten much of the book, I couldn't understand why Stephen King was rumored to be so displeased with the Kubrick film.<br /><br />Well after completing the re-read, I completely understand! The film, while brilliant, is nothing like the book.<br /><br />'The Shining' explores addiction, child abuse, wounds we harbor from our own parents aaannnd ghosts! (But aren't all those old mistakes and scars from childhood ghosts?)<br /><br />Fantastic. Don't short yourself by only watching the film and if you haven't watched the film... READ THIS FIRST!!<br /><br />...and I'm super-psyched about 'Dr. Sleep'
0062082353|5.0|This book was used, BUT it looked Brand New!  It also arrived a long time before the ETA. I would recommend this to EVERYone! I am very pleased & happy!!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|I like the option of having a secondary alarm due to the fact that I often oversleep if I only use one.

Most recommended for kids and adults ... steampunks or not.<br />This movie can be compared with the great work of Miyazaki, animation is great, the history is an adventure, thrilling and fun.
B003L77GRO|5.0|loved it and great price
B00AEBB8PQ|4.0|Stardust, the novel by Neil Gaiman, told the tale of a young man and his search to find a falling star. The \\"grown-up fairytale\\" had a very cinematic scale, so it was a natural choice for a film adaptation. The film opens with the authoritative narration of Sir Ian McKellen, explaining the history of the world and the strange city of Wall. The city is a fairly normal, English town, separated from the mysteries of the rest of the world by a large wall. When reading the book, I imagined a tall and expansive structure, but the film version leaves a bit to be desired. When our protagonist, Tristan, sets out the find a fallen star for his crush Victoria, he is initially unable to pass the elderly guard at the only exit in the structure. Looking at the wall, it seemed a bit unbelievable that the young man couldn't find another way over the wall, but this is a fantasy story, so I guess you have to suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />Despite this small gripe, the film really is great to look at. I would compare it to something slightly brighter than a Tim Burton movie, while still containing enough dark elements to keep a real sense of danger. When Tristan arrives at the site of the fallen star, he does not see the large rock that he expected. Instead, he learns that the star is actually a girl, played here by Clair Danes. As he begins to take the reluctant star back to Wall, he realizes that he is not the only one who wants the star.<br /><br />The king of the world outside of Wall, played by Peter O'Toole, is dying. His son's, there are seven of them, must kill each other off until there is only one remaining heir to the throne. The heir must also retrieve the fallen star, in order to take the throne. Additionally, there are three old witches, led by Michelle Pfeiffer, who seek the heart of the star to restore their youth. As Tristan navigates his way home, he is forced to face these characters, and make the transition from boy to man, in the process.<br /><br />If all of this seems a bit confusing, do not fret. The filmmakers do a much better job than I have of relaying this complex story. While there are several changes from the book, none are so great that the magic of the story is decreased. When it is boiled down to its bones, this is the story of a young man, forced to grow up and discover the true meaning of love. With the fantastic story combined with a strong ensemble of actors, I would definitely recommend both the book and film to anyone who is a fan of fairytales, and coming of age stories.this seems a bit confusing, do not fret.

1878424319|5.0|The Four Agreements  is a novel of achieving your own personal heaven on Earth.  The four Steps to living a more pure and clear live are no where near simple to do, with all of the forces attempting to trap you into your own personal hell, but if you take this book as a day by day guide for making your life a simpler, more positive one than it will make the efforts with the book worth it.<br />1. Be impeccable with your word<br />2. Don't take Anything Personally<br />3. Don't make Assumptions<br />4. Always do your Best<br />While all of this is very simplistic it is very common information that in this day and age we have all but thrown these ideas out the window. While reading this book, it makes it a very eye opening experience to have someone advise you that you are the cause of your unhappiness and that it can be solved by changing how you advise the world. It leads the reader to take a reality check as to why and how their life has landed where we are and how to change it to be happy.

B0063IH60K|5.0|When you have plenty of time to pass and enjoy this game is for you. This helped me pass a 4 hour layover in Atlanta.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I picked this book up on a whim, based on a friend's very simple \\"review\\" on my favorite reader's site, Goodreads. It lived up to my expectations with quirky, nerdy, deeply developed characters both young and old. The author used classically creative forms, such as writing, hammer and hot glue gun set design and knitting, seamlessly teamed with coding, scanning and algorithm development to create a story that amalgamates 500 year old cults, the inner workings of Google, science fiction and romance. It's a fun story that flirts with an age old desire and, in the end, clarifies what's most important to us all.
B00CDSIMI4|5.0|Very melodic and beautiful soundtrack, reminiscent of Diablo. Mournful and tragic in parts, ambient in others, it sets the mood of the game very well, and is quite enjoyable even without the context of the game.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I saw this movie at the Imax when it first came out. Wanted it for my home theater in 3D. Who wouldn't love a movie about Santa, Christmas and a train.
B000K8EQ5W|5.0|I didn't love it the first time, but the second time (a few years later) it really captured me. Let go of your need to make sense of the impossibility of it and enjoy a heartwarming, simple, original love story...

B001UV4XFG|3.0|A local radio personality talked about Twilight a lot.. I never knew what it was she was talking about.. then I saw it was available on TV and watched it.. I was hooked.. I bought all four books right away in a nice hard bound set.. and have all the movies and have seen them multiple times.  Fun to read and watch both as long as you just want to enjoy it and not question everything and tear it apart.

B003G4W49C|4.0|Thru most of the book I was really into it, but when I get to the end I was quite surprise as actually at that point I've expected action to get started. So I took one start as I don't like the way it ends (but this is just my preferences). Still I recommend that book.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As always, Downton Abbey is phenomenal. I love the series and that it's available on Amazon. I binged on the series once I saw that series 3 was available, and watched the whole thing in about 3 days. No shame.

B003TSEL7S|5.0|I enjoyed this book.<br />In my opinion though, I enjoyed the PJO saga more. I guess it was because this dealt with multiple characters (which is hard to keep up with at times.) and the other didn't. But all in all, it was still a great book!
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read a number of Harry Bosch adventures, and have enjoyed each of them. This one was extra good!!
B000FC0SIM|5.0|A fantastic read, easy to pick up and get through in a couple of days. I should declare I have no plans to be a writer, I am not even that good a reader as my lonely Kindle will weepingly (sorry Stephen) attest to.  That said Mr King's writing is inspiring to anyone who wants to be creative.  Instead of being a writer you may visit art galleries and paint every hour god sends, I am sure you would find value in reading this book and finding solace that you are not alone in being passionate about a craft. P.s. I can't paint either as my lonely easel will attest to.

This processor is pre-over clocked to run at 3.6/3.9 and this means the CPU runs HOT, 54 idle and it continues!! games lag out after awhile and things slow down.. I will buy more fans and update!<br /><br />I recommend getting after market cooling, water cooling or a lot of case fans.
B004IQ78HA|1.0|Typical Disney...everything's &#34;nice&#34; and &#34;sweet&#34; and &#34;charming&#34;. The written story is completely mutilated so Disney can sell products and candy.
6305718954|5.0|Great movie.
B002V0929W|4.0|I'm not an Englishwoman but I love English culture and history so, when I found this book, I bought it because its subject is very appealing to me. Moreover, it is written by an anthropologist whose writing is funny, I dare say ironic. I enjoyed many chapters but others were a bit repetitive.
B00DHNJGCU|3.0|Colin Farrell has a wide range of talent, and in this movie, it's almost like he's been in a box for 20 years and just got let out the week before. The movie stalls in several places , the relationship with the woman put me to sleep.
0553386794|5.0|Arguably George Martin's best book in the Song of Ice and Fire series, whether you're an avid fan wanting to own your own copy and reading it again or a new comer, this book is a must.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|A wonderful collection of senior cast members and great story made this movie worth adding to the library. Funny, a tad over the top, and campy dialouge mad this worth seeing again.
143911000X|3.0|It is a good book to be put on coffee table to entertain guest or for your own entertainment. Read a couple of pages, have a chuckle and put it down for next time.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Well the cast and director drew me to this one.<br />It's Dustin Hoffman's directorial debut, and he gathered a great cast of British talent in this film, including Maggie Smith, Pauline Collins, Billy Connolly, Michael Gambon, Tom Courtenay, and Andrew Sachs.<br />A little slow at time, but overall I enjoyed the film.<br />American star Dustin Hoffman made a very unique decision to go abroad direct an a mostly British cast in his first film as a director.<br />The dvd has a few extras, including a audio commentary by Hoffman (I'll have to give that a spin in the future!)<br />Recommended.
B00AW57L96|3.0|Easy to read and interesting enough<br />Nice ending and overall a good book especially while sitting by the pool with a drink
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Amazing and wonderful app lots of fun and very funny I downloaded it and it was great there's nothing wrong with the app and I played it for hours
B00BRUYQFC|3.0|There are a few good songs the rest not so good...<br />Too much repetition of the same line over and over for 3 minutes straight is not a song!
B0093X805W|5.0|This book is great!It is about a boy and he goes to a chocolate factory this book is also funny.
B001K3KK0Q|5.0|This movie has been a great reminder for me to fight against peer pressure as to chase after big mansion houses. I have recommended this to a lot of people who are seemingly confused.
1576875776|5.0|The book is  a real journey in the old days. Pictures are amazing, the story of Vivian Maier incredible. Love it!
B0085OF4GS|1.0|Thought it was cleaner and funnier than Airplane.... and then I watched some more.  Didn't care for the crudeness  and innuendos.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|A book filled with mini interviews from people who went through the zombie war. Very captivating and held my interest through the end.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|An interesting and suspenseful story of parents in an unthinkable situation. This is an easy read, be ready to get hooked.
0316044695|4.0|Was a good read, but after doing some research seems the author exagerating some.  Also has a few aviation-related mistakes, since that is something I know a lot about.  Aside from that, was a very interesting and heartbreaking account.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|A great read that really makes you think I didn't expect to like this so much, but was quickly hooked!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Funny and witty take on the standard dynamic. Excellent cast with good chemistry. Stylish settings with a soundtrack to bring it all together.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|A sad but somewhat inspiring story of love and making most of a short amount of time. This is a realistic portrayal of some emotional moments among friends and family.
B00DU74U74|3.0|If you want an action movie,forget about it!!!!!!<br />Is a chick flick,the story idea and the fxs are really good,but is a love story.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|great album, easy listening. i've purchased 3 CDs in the last 10 years or so, this being one of them. keep it up qotsa!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show for its action, suspense, plot and characters! I can't get enough of this show. Total addicted! Love Derryl!
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|I am a huge fan of Maggie Smith, I also am pursuing a career in Opera. This movie was well done, well acted, and the fears of singers are right on point. The DVD itself came in perfect condition! No complaints from me!
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|slow start, but highly recommended so I am glad that I stuck with Harold's pilgrimage  Beautifully written, descriptions<br /> of the people, and the landscape made the walk a joy.
B008N9AASC|5.0|A must-see. Beauty and wonderment from all over the world. We went through a full range of emotions watching this movie. Totally amazing!
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|This is a fantastic book,I have loved it for years for its captivating story. I'm glad an illustrated version is available
0062255657|5.0|This is a really great story. It has the right amount of magic and the right amount of spiritual questioning. It's amazing how Neil Gaiman is able to author a story with the degree of detail that he provides in only 150 or so pages. I haven't read anything else written by him so I can't compare this work to others but after reading &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; I will definitely explore his other books too! A real pleasure to read - especially if you want to be carried away to a whole different world!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|The series was made well, with relevant references to the original stories while integrating it into now-days society. The humor was witty and the actors knew their roles.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|Unusual structure, rhetorical breaks or discontinuances keep a reader focused and seeking connective threads.  The prose is descriptive and exotic dialogue just common enough to follow and understand.  The actions of characters and circumstances are carried on a roller coaster ride of emotional elation and depressions.  Wonderful stuff, a prophetic tale.<br /><br />*****
B004132HZS|5.0|Benedict Cumberbatch does a better job of portraying Sherlock than any other actor thus far, particularly given the difficulty of playing him in a modern world. Martin Freeman lives up to Watson's character as expected from stories, proving just the friend Sherlock needs. Well done, BBC!
159514188X|5.0|This product came very fast and on time and i am happy with this product! It is a low cost which is also good!
030789701X|5.0|Amazing amazing strat guide for such a great game. Not only can i finally do everything in skyrim but the deal that amazon gives you is practically unbeatable. Lets see i can drive 20 miles to my local gamestop and buy one of these badboys (if they still even have a hardcover edition) for a little over $50 w/tax. OR i can sit on my lazy bum order it off of here for ~$35 and just wait 2 days. Quite frankly for those more patient, buy it from amazon, its really worth the wait and the savings.
B009QU9X44|5.0|I liked this book very much because it spoke frankly about two very different cultures and their difficulties in understanding each other. The book is very well-written, and the characters are beautifully portrayed, making all of them believable and credible. Nuances of intelligence and education are  delicately constructed, and the two main characters are fully rounded and likeable. I would recommend this book to intelligent readers who like to pursue thought-provoking themes, and a layered challenging structure. This is the third book I have read by this author, and it has  fulfilled all I have come to expect of her. A rewarding experience!
B004EPYZQC|5.0|Fantastic Movie with Great Cast, Direction and Cinematography!!! An absolute MUST HAVE!!! Great addition to the Fast n Furious series!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Not for the cynical or weak of heart. Wanted this for my &#34;go to&#34; library. Love story between two people that lasts a lifetime, in sickness & in health. To see two great actors such as Gina Rowlands and James Gardner portray their real life ages hits home to the aging process. just watch any of their old movies, makes this story that travels from the past to the present more real. Enjoy the show and bring along your kleenex.
B0053FANPY|5.0|Great Action Movie and DVD!!! Great sequel to the original and continues this Action Packed Classic! Great Cast, Stunts, and Cinematography!!! A MUST HAVE!!!
B004ZJZQ92|5.0|Great cast, Robert Redford is at the top of his &#34;game&#34; in this &#34;sit back and watch it unravel&#34; spy thriller.
B000EYK4KI|5.0|good movie - and had to replace my old dvd that I had lost and even though it wasused seems to be working just fine and arrived right on time.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|Despite all warnings from other reviews, I went for the kindle version and I'm not at all disappointed in my decision. It is good and full credits to George R.R.Martin for such a great story.
B000JPRPAO|5.0|I lost my dvd so I had to buy a replacement because it is one of my favorite movies (with awesome characters) and I received it pretty quickly and everything seems to be in  order!
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|I like this card game, it's fun but you start with 10 gold coins and each games cost 2 gold coins and you can only get gold coins by the scratch card or leveling up. It's kind of a pain to wait 30 minutes for another scratch card to get gold coins, but other than that I give it a 4 star.
B001HN694K|5.0|This is a great adventure movie, no bad language, excellent, a bit scary for small kids, there are some intense scenes
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I downloaded this app and its awesome! You can hear the type of music you want to hear plus listen to broadcasts from other cities such fun I give it 5 stars
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great ending to a great series. The pace was fast, maybe even a little too fast. I will probably read this another 4 or 5 times. Worst part is that it's over. :(
B009WO7NQO|5.0|It was a good game in tell you get mad at the game and bust your phone and Kik your dog
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This a fun game for the kids to play also it helps them to use there brain to figure out the puzzle it's not like those mindless games that does nothing for them
B00992CF6W|5.0|Really fun to play and a little addicting, but the computer version is way better. On the other hand, it Isn't worth seven bucks and is one of the neediest games invented.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|When this book was recommended to me my first thought was that I can't afford it. My second thought was how can I NOT afford it? It seems that I was right. By suspending my doubt and earnestly performing the experiments put forth in Pam's book  I believe anyone can prove to themselves that they can create their own reality. I'm so glad I bought this book. Within two weeks it has paid for itself more than one hundred times over. I would suggest this easy, funny read to anyone and everyone regardless of your station in life! I'm so happy I got it. I just wish I bought the print version so I could lend it to friends.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|First love is always the deepest and Sparks takes this concept to the max! The ending was surprising and filled with hope.  Family responsibility and dedication is key as well as a deep sense of honor and respect with the characters of this saga. Tragedy and never ending love are the Ying and Yang.
B00013RC8O|5.0|OK, a bit cheesy and dated, but highly enjoyable. It features Cleavon Little a couple of years before &#34;Blazing Saddles&#34; made him a household name.
B0063IH60K|5.0|its a good stand by game I use it at work while im at lunch will download more soon thanks
0670024813|4.0|I see I've used that title before, but it applies here as well.  There's obviously a lot to be learned from \\"traditional societies\\", the kind we and our bodies evolved in for most of our history.  Professor Diamond is a thoughtful observer of traditional and modern societies and is not an anthropologist so he may lack certain axes they would feel need grinding.  Also he does not romanticize traditional living.  I look at this book as being knowledgeable and objective.<br /><br />I loved \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\" and felt it was extremely explanatory.  This is not as fascinating as that, and at first I thought it might be tough going, but this may be of more personal value and more value to society than that, if enough people read it and think about it.  And Diamond is a good writer so it's not a tough slog by any means.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son and I love playing this game together. So much fun. We get frustrated, especially with Vector, but we can't give up. :)
B00CFYD682|4.0|Great to have a new Alison disc, whatever the style! A surprising return to the \\"electronica\\" of the early years, although updated with a very modern if sometimes jarring production. Not my cup of tea usually, but I'm not too hung up on styles (artists above all!).<br /><br />There are some great moments here, particularly \\"When I Was Your Girl\\", \\"A Place to Stay\\", \\"Filigree\\" and \\"Rung by the Tide\\". High drama on these, in the best Alison tradition. The rest are passable to quite good. It has to be said, though, that her voice is sometimes buried in the mix, and could be almost any quality singer. That is the main artistic problem with this genre of music, as it is mostly a producer's medium. The arrangements at least are fairly intricate. Alison is a 5+ star singer and writer, but I have never heard anything in this style to rate 5 stars.<br /><br />I had heard she was thinking of a hardcore r&b/blues disk prior to this. That would have been great, but who knows? This is possibly a more original alternative.<br /><br />What can I say, I dig the classic artists. and this woman is classic. Got this the same day as the new Deep Purple and Blackmore's Night cd's, and the last BOC studio album I previously missed. That was a good day. Hopefully we won't have to wait several more years again for her next effort.
B008DM4OTA|3.0|Trash never gits in the bin and finding the ear mites is hard  every time you are done some trash is always on the floor
B009MF56GC|2.0|Overall this move was terrible -- the story, the acting, the special effects, even most of the action. THAT SAID -- Jean Claude Van Damme was really great and for me the only redeeming quality to the movie. In all of the areas where the movie fell short he was fantastic. His acting really stood out possibly because the other characters had poor dialogue and were the major participants in an overall poorly written story and dialogue. And of course his martial arts ability is always on point. Stallone -- please don't waste all of the talent you have in these movies and get a decent script writer, directer, etc., this next go around.
B004WMKSH2|1.0|The product was very poor as the streaming circle interrupted the movie every 60 seconds or so.  The resolution was very poor also possibly associated with the same issue. I will not use this service again.  Can I get my money back?
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Great book to be enjoyed at any age. An interest approach to narrative based on different characters yet restricted to preteens and teenagers. Very moving to anyone who has been in touch with similar stories or anyone that is ready to be touched by a special soul.
B00AYDC5HY|2.0|I rented this for last day of school thinking my kids would enjoy it but it seemed to be too long and my kids chose instead, to play on their iPads.
B003TTKB5I|5.0|i dont like doctor shows---they make me feel like i am at work. this is more of a story about people and relationships and it just happens in a hospital setting. i have finished season 1 and 2 and working on 3 now and continue to enjoy the show.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Well worth the purchase price...high octane adventure with enough historical accuracy to make you want to believe. Great fyn !
B00821OX98|5.0|Generally, I am not a huge fan of alien movies, but this show really grasps your attention with incredible writing, cliffhangers, and characters you get attached to.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|None are perfect, but it makes them real. Emotional and challenging. This novel will always be a favorite. It will make you more compassionate.
B00CA4S27W|4.0|A mix of originals and covers done in the Blackmore's Nght style. Their version of Uriah Heep &#34;Lady In Black&#34; is very good as well as their cover of the Rainbow tune &#34;The Temple Of The King&#34;. What made the album for me was the tribute to ex-Purple mate the late Jon Lord on &#34;Carry On...Jon&#34;. Hope to hear that song live.
B00D4PDJMY|4.0|There are two types of Phil fans, the ones who only like Pantera and think Superjoint sucks and the ones who enjoy his entire career.  The ones who only like Pantera and think Hellyeah is good will not like this album because it does not have that groove and commercial appeal that Pantera did. If you enjoy metal and do not conform to what most people think metal should be you will enjoy this album.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Let me first say prior to reading this book I had read the other two Crossfire novels and really loved Eva and Gideon's story.  A lot of bloggers and reviewers compare this series to FSofG, and although I do see the similarities, in my opinion Sylvia Day writes a better hot and sexy romance!  I was eagerly awaiting this book so I could find out how the Crossfire trilogy was going to be wrapped up...I was so disappointed when I read some other reviews that said this was not the final book and there are going to be two more!  I was really dreading picking up the book and starting it, because I just couldn't imagine dragging the store line out.  Well, I will say that although I still think that this should have been the final novel in the series, I was still entertained with Eva and Gideon and as always not disappointed by the passionate and steamy love scenes between the two of them.<br /><br />\\"Entwined with You\\" picks up where \\"Reflected in You\\" left off...Eva and Gideon have ended their relationship so that Detective Graves does not suspect Gideon in Nathan's murder.  We find out that he has briefly reunited with Corrine to make the split with Eva appear real all the while he moves into an apartment next door to Eva and Cary's so he can spend hot, steamy nights with her and convince her that they need to be together.  The story goes on and there continues to be drama with Corrine, Eva's mother Monica and her dad, of course Cary and his messed up love triangle, and another scored woman from Gideon's past pops up determined to make waves.  I have to say that I found the story slowing and a lot of the events unnecessary.  \\"Entwined with You\\" could have ended with Eva and Gideon getting married (which they did in private and in secret) and left the reader to come up with their own conclusions about their future together.  Instead a scorned lover who also happens to be a reporter is brought into the mix to cause trouble for Gideon and Eva, Eva's rocker ex-boyfriend is determined to win her back and Cary is possibly going to be a father.  It is all just a little too much.  But still, the scenes between Gideon and Eva are as hot as ever!  Although I am thinking I should protest continuing the Crossfire series by not reading the next two installments, I know I will because the writing is too hot not too :)<br /><br />3/5 for extra steamy love scenes<br /><br />~M
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had already watched the movie and decided that the book was something that I had to read. I was not disappointed.  The characters were very well written and even though I knew what was going to happen it was still a very good read.
B002APU580|5.0|This is the best shortened adaption available. I've read all Jane Austen books and a number multiple times. Love this story. The only better one is the BBC one, but that's +6 hours, so if you want to just do a movie night or don't have 6 hours to spare in your busy schedule like tends to happen with me, then this is the one to see. I actually own both :)
034580404X|5.0|I have read and reread this 3 times. Love it looking forward to the movie. I have also got others to buy the books they also loved it.
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works as specified. A good replacement for the original product. Great as a backup power supply. Worth the price, highly recommended.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is almost like the game templerun. Although there are tremendous differences in both games the player still runs and avoids obsticles to get powerups. This game is still very exiting and tremendously funny!

I love this game and will play it till I die !!!!!! mine craft is the best app u could get on the kindle.  it has all the things i. look for in a game, creative, crafts, it is my dre&aacute;m game
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Yes it was very enjoyable. Not sure why everyone was complaining considering it does an awesome job setting up for the next installment.
B008JFUNYG|3.0|I was always a big fan of the original EVIL DEAD. It was one of those movies that most people hadn't heard of but that word got around about. When you saw it you had no idea what to expect. This small group of film makers had pieced together a classic horror film putting a new twist on the old dark house by moving it into the woods and creating a whole new sub-genre. It was only a matter of time before the folks in Hollywood decided it was time to remake the film.<br /><br />The story is a bit changed this time around. The make up of 5 characters tossed into an inescapable situation remains but their make up is altered as well as their motivation for being at the cabin. Jane Levy stars as Mia, a drug addict who has tried cold turkey before but is willing to give it one more shot. Her friends Olivia (Jessica Lucas), a nurse, and Eric (Lou David Pucci) have driven her to her old family cabin in the woods. They are met there by her normally absent brother David (Shiloh Fernandez) and his girlfriend Natalie (Elizabeth Blackmore).<br /><br />Mia swears off the drugs and dumps the last that she has. As the day progresses she begins to show signs of trouble and it's during that time that Olivia tells David that she O.D.ed once already and won't survive if they don't force her to stay. At the same time Mia continues to complain about a smell and the group discovers a cellar to the old place. In that cellar they find numerous animal corpses, what appears to be a burned center post to the cabin and a book wrapped in barbed wire.<br /><br />While the group does their best to help with Mia, Eric decides that he absolutely must see what is beneath the barbed wire. He cuts it off and discovers a book whose cover seems to be made of human skin. As he reads the books, he cuts his hand on its pages dripping blood on it. The book shows demonic symbols and pictures and has written in blood on one page \\"Do not write! Do not read! Do not follow!\\" So of course Eric decides the smartest thing to do is all three. Reading words that were hidden which he finds by pencil rubbing technique, he unleashes the demons contained within. He doesn't know it yet, but he has.<br /><br />Mia in the throws of cold turkey argues with the group that she wants to leave. David finally agrees with the group that it wouldn't be the best idea and she retreats to her room. So it seems. In truth she stole his car keys and takes off in David's car. Driving in the pouring rain she thinks she sees someone in the road and crashes the car to avoid them. When she gets out of the car she's pursued by this same person and eventually falls into the forest only to find the forest grasping her limbs and holding her in place while it a root slides up her leg and rapes her. I would say this is a spoiler but it was one of the most talked about scenes in the original film and here.<br /><br />David and the group find Mia and take her back to the cabin. Mia tries to tell them that there is something in the woods but of course no one believes her. When things go from bad to worse David tries to take her to town but unfortunately the road is flooded with the non-stop rain. Returning to the cabin it is now that the really creepy, scary stuff begins. What, you thought everything described so far was bad? As the circus barker used to say \\"You ain't seen nuthin' yet folks!\\"<br /><br />So how does this film stack up against the original? Well for one this film had a much bigger budget to work with. That being said the quality of the film making here is top notch with some effective photography to be seen and special effects that are state of the art. The acting by all involved is well done, especially Levy as Mia. The only thing lacking here, at least for me, was the script.<br /><br />The original found the group having the demons basically forced on them when they accidentally played a tape recording found in the cellar. Here we have a character that seems to be a self centered idiot who totally ignores the warnings in the book NOT to read or write passages who then does exactly that. I'm willing to suspend belief when watching horror of sci-fi films but this took the cake. How stupid do you have to be to completely ignore the warnings there for you to see? If he had acted like he was skeptical of what he was reading or that he thought it was a joke maybe, but here he's portrayed as taking a scholarly approach to what he's reading and then saying it out loud while ignoring the warning.<br /><br />Perhaps the biggest differences between to two are those seen in most movies made from one generation to the next. While there was some swearing in the original film it was nothing like the F bombs dropped non-stop in this one. The gore factor was also amped up. The original had some truly gross out moments for its day but those on display here surpass anything from the original. SPOILER: If watching someone drag their tongue along the edge of a box cutter's blade bothers you then this is not your type of film.<br /><br />This was my second time seeing this film having seen it in the theater first. I thought it held up better this time than I did then. Still, for me this movie is less about story and more about how much gore they could offer. The bad part about that is that most of it was so far over the top as to be completely unbelievable. My guess is that if you've been stabbed in the eye with a needle, stabbed in the chest with a chunk of broken mirror, shot with nails from a nail gun, had your hand split in two by a crowbar and then stabbed again you're not going to be cognizant enough to continue talking let alone help anyone. Not in this film.<br /><br />Like I said, it's not a terrible film but it isn't near as good as the original. Kids of today might like it better since gore seems to be the way they rate a film. For me the original is better. One thing of note, watch this one until the credits finish for what I thought was the best thing in the movie.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this app! It is so realistic and just like a real ranch. I grew up on a ranch and this is pretty close to real life.
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|With the overabundance of horror films coming out, it's difficult to decide what you should or should not watch. My son, a die hard horror fan, found the recent THE PURGE a total disappointment and yet they got his ticket money. So when a truly creepy, terrifying film comes out its only natural that fans will pass the word along. Let me pass the word right now about MAMA - I loved it!<br /><br />The story opens with an investment banker having a breakdown, killing his partners and his wife and then taking his daughters to a secluded house in the woods where he intends to kill them and then himself. Before he can follow through with this act he is whisked away by an unseen force and the girls are left to fend for themselves...or with the help of their unseen benefactor.<br /><br />Fast forward 5 years and we come to Lucas (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), the girl's uncle, who has spent what resources he has on someone searching for them. As the group is about to stop they do indeed find the girls. At a clinic where they are being watched and taken care of Dr. Dreyfuss (Daniel Kash) does his best to help the girls readjust to their new surroundings. In doing so he later explains to Lucas that the girls seem to have created an unseen friend called Mama. Eventually they're able to return to their family and a battle for the girls between their aunt Jean and Lucas results in Lucas having custody.<br /><br />Along with his girlfriend Annabelle (Jessica Chastain), a bass player in a rock band, they are aided by the doctor. He wants to continue to treat the girls and knowing their aunt will move them across country, he provides this new family with a home to stay in owned by the clinic he works in. But his research isn't limited to the girls in the home. We witness him traveling to a different city to look into the past of someone we're unaware of yet.<br /><br />At the home the girls seem a bit gun shy at first but slowly begin to open up to Lucas. This doesn't last long as some unseen entity knocks him over the railing at the top of the stairs and he ends up in the hospital. Now Annabelle, who wants nothing to do with children, is left to oversee these two. It's a slow adjustment but eventually she wins the trust of the girls and the friendship of the elder of the pair, Victoria (Megan Carpentier). An incident with the younger girl, Lilly (Isabelle Nelisse) breaks down her walls as well.<br /><br />But someone, or something, in the house still seems to preoccupy the girls, most notably Lilly. We get not glimpses but a full on look at just what is behind this but have no idea yet what is causing this image to appear. I won't spoil it by saying just what that is but I will offer a word of advice: if you scare easy, keep the blanket pulled close to your eyes. And if you know someone who scares easy, make sure they don't have hold of your arm for fear of an injury during one of the many scenes guaranteed to make you jump.<br /><br />This film is not just a scare fest but a film filled with just the right tone to make your skin crawl at all the right moments and some of the not right moments as well. Visions of \\"Mama\\" are certain to become the things of nightmares for children whose parents allow them to watch this film thinking that the PG-13 rating makes it safe for them. It isn't. They will be scared. Come to think of it I might have to turn on my lights tonight before going to bed.<br /><br />The behind the scenes efforts on this film are tremendous. The direction by Andres Muschietti is wonderful and he pulls some outstanding performances not just from the adult actors but from the children in particular. To think that children this young could pull off the job it takes to make this believable and to make you care is amazing and they do it with apparent ease.<br /><br />The special effects seen here are also outstanding. They convey the slow moving rot that appears from time to time and then blast you out of your seat with one of the scariest visages in some time. Perhaps not enough that you'll look away but enough that it will stick with you.<br /><br />Readers will know after all these years that I am a fan of horror, sometimes too much so. But this was one film that I know I'll be watching more than once and enjoying each and every time. And while I enjoy it there is one thing I know I'll do for at least the first few times around: keep the lights on.st visages in some time.

Sometimes it works fine, sometimes it crashes during use, and sometimes it won't even open. Very frustrating when I want to get my Pinterest fix! I think now I will just access Pinterest through the browser.
B00CFA227C|3.0|The most difficult thing about reviewing new DVDs each week is choosing just which title to write about. While you would love to write about the best film being released it's not always a movie that's easily accessible. So you do the next best thing. You write about the one that will be easily found and probably rented or purchased by more folks than any other. So if you want to know what the best release is this week read what I've written about SOLOMON KANE.<br /><br />That being said let's take a look at what will probably be the big DVD of the week, JACK THE GIANT SLAYER. Directed by Bryan Singer, the man responsible for the X-Men trilogy, SUPERMAN RETURNS, VALKYRIE and one of my favorite movies, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, brings us a new take on the classic fairy tale that I'm sure we all heard growing up. Trust me when I say this isn't your grandpa's giant killer.<br /><br />Jack here, played by Nicholas Hoult, is indeed a young farm boy who has fond memories of his mother reading him the fairy tale but who now finds himself living with his uncle and being forced to sell the family horse to get money to fix their home. In town he bumps into a friar on the run from the evil Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci). The friar has stolen some magic beans from Roderick in hopes of preventing him from using them to reach the legendary giants as well as the crown that held them at bay from attacking folks here on Earth. Before he can be caught he entrusts the beans to Jack and tells him to take them to the Abby for safekeeping. Of course Jack's uncle gets mad and tosses the beans at him, several of which fall through the cracks in the floor to the ground in the midst of a terrible rain storm.<br /><br />Back at the castle Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) is set to marry Roderick, something she truly does not want to do. But as with all medieval films it seems princesses are nearly always forced into a marriage with someone they don't love to solve problems in the kingdom. This story is no different and that evening Isabell runs away from home. Where does she end up? At Jack's house of course.<br /><br />Having met earlier in the day, when Jack attempted to save her honor from some ruffians when she was in disguise, the two are drawn to one another but realize that there is no way a princess may marry a commoner. Before their attraction can kick in, the beans hatch and begin lifting the house into the skies. Jack attempts to save Isabell but is tossed from the house before he can do so.<br /><br />The next day the king's men show, led by knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) head of the elite guard. The king sends Elmont along with Roderick, several guards and Jack who insists on going along. They make the treacherous climb up the beanstalk and find the land that was spoken of in fairy tales, a land where giants actually exist. They also have the uncanny ability to smell out the Englishmen who have made there way upwards.<br /><br />The rest of the film answers the questions will they escape, will Roderick find the crown and rule over all, will Jack and Isabell find a way around their differences to fulfill true love and will the giants make their way down the beanstalk to attack England? I could answer all of those questions but there is more fun in watching them than reading here about those answers.<br /><br />The film moves along at a brisk pace, never slacking off or becoming tiresome. The acting by all is well played with McGregor moving comfortably into the swashbuckling hero role he began playing in the STAR WARS films. Hoult does a great job as well as the impressionable Jack and Tomlinson portrays the fair maiden in distress admirably. But while the acting is good it's the special effects folks are waiting for in this movie.<br /><br />Those special effects live up to all expectations. The giants are all quite believable with each one having their own special characteristics and quirks about them. In the lead is General Fallon, a two headed creature bent on taking back the lower land they once ruled. The beanstalk is also well thought out and offered up in its full glory.<br /><br />In the end I can say that this film was an enjoyable time, an evening well spent. It offered some new twists to an old tale, some great acting, notable special effects and never attempted to become offensive with gross out jokes or language. There are some violent moments that might bother small children (people being eaten by giants) but I would say the whole family could enjoy this one together. Unless you're the Addams family, in which case you'll want to rent EVIL DEAD.ed creature bent on taking back the lower land they once ruled.

B009AMAJPA|3.0|I wrote recently about the slow burn. What I'm talking about is a movie where the pieces are readily available to you to figure out what exactly is going on. This doesn't mean these pieces are doled out in a haphazard order but that they are given to you one at a time, letting the story unfold rather than thrown at you in one big shove. Classic films were all about the slow burn but lately it seems that the MTV generation can't stand taking the time to hear a story out. They want it slam bam in your face right now! In viewing movies that way they miss so much.<br /><br />DEAD MAN DOWN is a slow burn film. It does offer plenty of action eventually but the story is the important thing here. Colin Farrell stars as Victor, a low level gang member who's on his way up in the world. Victor works for Alphonse (Terence Howard), a high level suit and tie thug who uses his gang to get property rather than the usual criminal endeavors. Someone has been sending Alphonse clipped squares from a photo along with snippets of sentences. This same person is seeking revenge against him but he has no clue who or why.<br /><br />When a member of Alphonse' gang is found in the basement freezer of his home it delivers another message to him. Not only the clues this time but the fact that the person sending them can get to him any time and anywhere. Alphonse thinks he knows who is behind it and he and his gang face down against a Jamaican crew that gives him a cut of their profits. Things go wrong and a shootout begins during which Victor saves Alphonse' life thus earning him more respect from his boss.<br /><br />The story involves a secondary plot as well. Victor lives in a high rise and across the way from his apartment lives Beatrice (Noomi Rapace). Beatrice is an attractive woman with a problem: the left side of her face is terribly scarred. She eventually approaches Victor in what seems like a date until she tells him the truth. She watched from across the way as he murdered the man recently found in Alphonse' freezer. She tells him she won't go to the police if he will do her one favor: kill the man who scarred her. It seems that the man was drunk when his car plowed into hers and did nothing more than 3 months in jail. Now she wants revenge.<br /><br />What we have are two separate cases of revenge here. Victor's due to a tragedy he suffered because of Alphonse and Beatrice's from the drunk driver. Victor agrees to help her but lets her know his problem comes first. The two eventually help one another and begin to develop a bond that goes beyond a simple business arrangement. And as that bond develops perhaps the days where life is nothing more than existing to seek revenge might change to a reason worth living.<br /><br />Farrell has turned in some really good performances lately (see SEVEN PSYCHOPATHS) but it doesn't appear that they are done in movies that are extreme money makers. But that doesn't stop him from doing the best he can which is quite good. Rapace is making a name for herself in English language films and shows what a solid actress she is here. Both are extremely compelling in their roles here, making you care about two people scarred, both inside and out, that are just trying to find their place in life again.<br /><br />As I said from the start, the clues meted out in this film are offered slowly but at a steady pace making the movie both interesting and well thought out. Don't go in expecting guns ablaze from start to finish but rather a movie that will make you think and solve the puzzles left for one and all to see. If you know this up front you'll have a movie that will entertain from beginning to end.ecently found in Alphonse' freezer.

B00BUAEYVK|2.0|I've been a big fan of Bruce Willis since the days of MOONLIGHTING. When he headed for the big screen I remained a fan. That being the case each time I've heard that a new DIE HARD movie was coming out I found myself excited to see what would happen next. I even enjoyed LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD which many critics savaged. Unfortunately I'll have to join them this time around with A GOOD DAY TO DIE HARD.<br /><br />This time around John McClane (Willis) heads for Russia when his son Jack (Jai Courtney) is on trial for murder there. The film opens with us learning about two political rivals, ex-business partners Komarov (Sebastian Koch) and Chagarin. Komarov is imprisoned by his former partner who will release him if he would only provide him with a file he hid years ago. Instead, Komarov intends to try and speak his peace before a court, if Chagarin will allow it to happen.<br /><br />As John heads to the courthouse to help his son, his son sits in an enclosed cell in the courtroom next to Komarov after telling the police that he will implicate Komarov if they will lighten his sentence. That all changes when a set of vehicles parked outside the courthouse explode and a team intent on extricating Komarov enters guns blazing. Jack rescues Komarov and they head to a waiting vehicle only to be stopped by John delaying Jack's rescue.<br /><br />It turns out that Jack is working for the CIA and was there to help Komarov all along. But John has no idea and instead screws things up. A chase through the highways of Moscow between Jack's van and the armored vehicle in pursuit follows with John trying to catch up in a vehicle he commandeers. This leads to a far too long chase sequence that involves more vehicles than one would think are even available in Moscow.<br /><br />In the end they escape through John's intervention, head for a safe house and John learns what his son's job is all about. Before the happy reunion can go any further, another team sweeps in to catch Komarov and both McClanes must do their best to rescue him and keep him out of harms way while trying to devise an escape plan.<br /><br />More twists and turns in the plot follow with an over abundant amount of destruction. Buildings are blown apart by high caliber ammunition sprayed by a helicopter as well as machine gun fire aplenty. This movie must have had a tie in with some window manufacturer as the deadly duo either shoots out or jumps through more windows by the end of the film than are seen in most films.<br /><br />It all ends up in a final shoot out that involves the same helicopter, hand grenades, machine guns, hand guns and more. And for some reason the police and Russian army have no idea what is going on or any way of even finding the criminals involved to capture them or the McClane boys. I'm not sure but the moment that much fire power is involved or a fireball lights up the sky you would think that would be a clue as to what is going on.<br /><br />The biggest problem with the film and after the rest I know this will sound strange, but it doesn't have enough plot. With the exception of John going to save his son we don't get anything else until nearly 50 minutes into the movie. And the plot line we do get feels forced and shoved together, the final twist not even something that comes as a surprise or takes up much story time. The movie is well made but hard to appreciate since most of it is spent either running, driving or flying somewhere in pursuit.<br /><br />I'm still a Willis fan. I'll still go back and watch the previous films in this series. I was glad that I watched this one as a rental because if I had paid for the DVD I would have been disappointed. As a rental this one can be a good night's entertainment but not one that I'd want to watch over again. If the idea was to spin off of the elder McClane to a new series of films involving his son then they've failed. As a stand alone action flick it's not bad but no better than a number of direct to DVDfilms that have come out this year. So in the end, worth watching = yes, worth owning = no.films that have come out this year. So in the end, worth watching = yes, worth owning = no.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Love Mr Gaiman's works. This is more of a fairy tale for adults full of scary things but spirituality also.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is the best like omg. I love the movie (both of them)  and love the game to :)

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've been waiting for Downton Abbey Season 3 to be available free via Prime Membership.  It was worth the wait.  What a great series and to get it free is fantastic.  Be careful... it's so good, you'll be hooked!
0316224588|5.0|Time spent with Rebus is time enjoyably spent.  Rankin is so deft with this character you don't see him working. Rebus is so human - such a mix - funny, gruff, impulsive, impatient.  May he never retire!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|We really enjoyed watching the movie! Like the mix of humor and action. We look forward to seeing the next release....
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie is great. I would recommend it. So cute how all these fairy tale characters come together. Superb imagination.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Good viewing. It shows how we often miss what is right in front of our faces.It is nice if we realize this before we die.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Meat Loaf is my all time favorite .. I love all there music.. I bought this cd to keep unopened in case something were to happen to my other 2 copies...Even my 94 year old mother knows most of the words to the songs on this cd since I always play it in the house and in my car...
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I'm completely addicted to the show. Well written story line, the actors do a marvelous job with the characters. I enjoy watching the ever evolving  relationship between Sherlock and Watson.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|All Quell games are fabulous; if you haven't tried all three you definitely should. Engaging puzzles, cleverly presented. Always a pleasant experience.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|This is a nice read, but feels like a short story. The characters are well developed, the story is interesting with plenty of surprises, and like all his other books its a little quirky. I really enjoyed it, but I cold have used a couple of hundred more pages.  When I finished I wanted more.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|just like what you know this is a pefect album, if you love R&B, you will love this! It is killing me!
B009CG29RK|5.0|This movie will please and entertain all ages. I love it!!! I find myself singing many of the songs as well.
B006XBSAP2|5.0|just like a summer album, i listen to her some every day! it is awesome! you should have it if you like pop
B005DJREJS|5.0|Great view of what high schoolers go through. Including frenemies, heartache and the embarrassment of a terrible misunderstanding of a legitimate accident.
B00DHNAQ2Y|2.0|I kind of removed the fact that this is an \\"evil dead\\" remake when writing this review because it's not.  At least, not really.  So it's \\"untitled horror movie 2013\\" to me.  That having been said it's not awful from a horror perspective the plot and characters are razor thin but the effects and gore are spot on.  It's typical of most \\"B\\" horror movies of this \\"transmitting virus or curse\\" type (think cabin fever where there is no real villain except the virus itself).  Even within this genre the rules of this movie don't make a whole lot of sense.  It's not like it aims to be realistic (being some sort of demonic curse) but they play the violence as \\"realistic\\" in some cases and not realistic in others.  Some characters will die too easily others won't bleed out when they should and it has nothing to do with the demonic curse.  They were playing it like \\"if you die you become infected\\" with some characters but that makes no sense given the rules of the movie (the demon having to consume 5 souls to come into the real world; or some such nonsense).  At the end (by my count) he only consumed 4 souls or possibly less (unless they were counting the dog?) and the demon still came into the real world as some possessed witch or whatever.<br /><br />Lot's of plot holes with that final battle as well, she drops the gas cap on the chainsaw and it's raining outside yet somehow it still works after running around with it in the rain for a long time; the demon is not dismembered (even by horror movie standards, let alone evil dead standards).<br /><br />I sound hyper-critical but even disassociating it from the series this is not a good \\"horror\\" movie at all.  It's not funny, not scary, not interesting, not enjoyable to watch, it's just meh.  Probably deserves less than 2 stars but the imagery and effects are pretty good despite the fact the movie sucks.<br /><br />Rent or avoid.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It's a really good game and I would play it again I love history and this is a good app
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|This book tells the story of a family in Afghanistan, living in poverty, and their resilience and endurance, the necessary traits for their survival. The book is beautifully written and very sad at times. To get the maximum enjoyment from this book, do not read it if you are likely to have a few days of not reading before picking up the book again. The author tells the story through the different characters and if you put the book down for a couple of days, it is difficult to pick up and remember which character is telling the story. Well worth the five stars, I can't wait for the next book!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|Got to test this out at Comic-Con International and it's fantastic. Charged my phone fully from 20% within  1-1.5 hours and that was a lifesaver.
1781162646|5.0|This was a slight departure from the usual Stephen King, but I truly enjoyed it!  I really don't have a lot of time to read, but I zipped right through this one because it was hard to put down!  I liked it even more because it was set in North Carolina and I'm a native of North Carolina!
B0049IHX2C|3.0|The second of the Men in Black films is fun - the dog is a nice comedy element - but it isn't nearly as interesting or funny as the first film.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I had to keep checking to see if a man wrote this book... It's like insight to the male thought process. It had be cracking up about things like baginas and CPS. I wanted to slap Evan at times and say &#34;awwwww&#34; at others. Totally a fun read. My only complaint is that he uses religious names throughout and it was overkill.
B004JMY312|5.0|I know, I know. This movie may seem ridiculously old to some, but it was still cute! I love it, and come back to it every so often just for fun. And the kids love it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the best books I have read. Should be a great series. I am looking forward to the next book.
B00742BVW8|5.0|This is a movie for an all around audience. People who like Jet Li will like this movie. People who just want to see bad-ass martial arts, will like this movie. People who want a story, will like this movie. People who like drama, will like this movie. Hell, people who just want something with subtitles, will like this movie.<br /><br />Personally, I still share it with rare individuals I think can appreciate the artistry, talent, and incredible work that went into the creation of this film. Years later, and I still love it.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I feel reviews on movies are very subjective based on the reviewers taste. As a person who likes the comic book film genre, this is a good movie. If you aren't a fan of these types of films, steer clear. Its very similar to most. Good vs. Evil. Evil wants to destroy something for personal gain. Good must stop them. Witty banter. Explosions. Good wins, but only at the last second. Recognize hero. Smoochy, smoochy. Cliff hanger for next movie. The end.<br /><br />Even though its predictable, I still enjoyed seeing characters come to life.
0345529057|5.0|Started reading after watching HBO series. Definitely glad I decided to read. Funner than the series on TV so if you liked the series you will be happier reading the books
B002RKSCA6|3.0|I always heard about this story and now I finally got to read it. It was just too short for my like but I enjoyed it!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Awesome show!  Love it.  Working on Season 2 now.  Great video quality.  No issues.  Love the show!!!  Love Amazon Video!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved this book and stayed up 'way too late reading it because I wanted to see what happened next. The end leaves one hanging, but ready to buy the second book in the series to see 1) where the author will go with the story and 2) what will happen with the love interests. I highly recommend.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 of DowntonAbbey was wonderful,full of great developed characters and in-depth relationships that kept me wanting more. The sets are amazing,costumes so true to the period, and character development so sttisfyong and suspenseful. I am so glad so many of my friends kept bugging me to watch. I'm totally hooked!

B00CHG10SQ|5.0|This album is a change in a sense to the typical amorphis sound, thought they deliver it Amorphis style.  The higher pitch death metal vocals, I didn't care too much for, but the rest of the album is great.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I was not familiar with RSS feeds until today. That's that little orange logo that looks like a wi-fi symbol that you see on just about every web page thats important to you. Feedly is beautiful and user friendly. Displays nice windows that slide up/down and side/side. Very nice resolution for you Fire HD!
B009GEPPYC|5.0|I saw the musical  and it was like I was at the most epic rock concert ever and the movie stays true to it. I loved how they tweeked it for the big screen and Tom Cruise is an amazing Stacy Jaxx and that he has a deeper, better character in the movie than in the play. All in all, glad I bought it I will be watching it again
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This app was installed on my Kindle Fire for quite a while. I never really paid it much attention because it was one of the &#34;original&#34; apps I installed when I bought my kindle. Man was I missing out. You can open up multiple windows and move files around very efficiently. Maybe I bought the ES originally and it was upgraded to ES3. I am really impressed with the improvements the developer has done on this app.
B0094K1WZE|3.0|Your typical Mission Impossible movie, full of action and suspense.  Tom could probably continue playing this role for years to come, like Sean Connery in 007.
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Amazon says its not compatible. I think that may have to do with the camera function. I just turned the camera off. 15GB of storage is hard to pass up! Amazon can have my pics! I had to side load the app because Amazon did not send it.

B007FTZDN8|5.0|Almost everything we have avaliable on TV and now on hand leld divices is #@^&*$.  If you watch TED you can fill in the blank.  If you are having trouble, most programing is directed at you and your relatives.  It's hardly new to wonder what a visitor from another planet would deduce from watchine american TV., yet there are times when we want to watch something creative, something intelligent.<br />  TED isn't just an alturnative, it's what quality programing feels like.  It grabs you and makes you think.  It also hurts and makes you laugh and even cry.  It isn't just educational TV it's more than that, and my brain is feeling better for it.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|My four year old was the first to live this, followed by my husband and then me. It's simple, fun, just challenging to keep it from being boring but not so hard it frustrated me. The money is cute and dances around entertainingly. Great game.

1908117230|4.0|It was very unselfish of him to actually release a book full of his precious macaron techniques and recipes. However, I believe that the translation from French to English actually made some recipe transcriptions unclear. Some of the recipes that I tried for the filling (followed to the letter!), didn't really live up to my expectations. Oh well, no worries, we learn to tweak whatever suits our tastebuds or allow time to cultivate them. Very beautiful pictures. A second book should perhaps be released. I'd like to see the recipes for his new creations. Or even hope he'd give insight about the baking temperatures and timing needed to do his large spiral piped Ispahan macaron. A recipe for Miss Gla Gla perhaps? Hahaha!
1451629192|5.0|A great book and how amazing she is to survive it all.  I can't believe how lazy the parole officers were in this case, it would have been so easy for them to find her in that back yard.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I got the app and played it nonstop because it is so awesome and it finally came out for the kindle.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We love the show, the characters and everything. We were very, very frustrated how it ended. Why is everyone dying?
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed this book - it was uplifting, well written, humorous. All things I value in my inspiration. For me, most of the experiments didn't yield big results, BUT I do agree with what she's saying. This will be a succinct book that I will revisit often just to keep my experiments going with these concepts.
B00B7ERH04|4.0|It was quick and easy to learn and I am glad I down loaded the app for this. Thank you.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|I need the walkthrough. Where is it? I'm hung up in the bedroom, antique shop and book store. I need help!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|My grandkids are much better at these electronic games than I will ever be. But this game is awesome. I enjoy playing games but get frustrated when they are too difficult .not the case with this one. Though there are some ..for the kids.. but most of them are grandma friendly. And that makes me very happy ;-)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Well, I wasn't expecting this. I thought it would be exactly like temple run, like all of the where's my water's. But this is totally different. The controls are different and more challenging, which makes the game more fun, and my favorite part is the random battles with vector. Now, there's a challenge. :):):):):):)
B009NG1Q96|5.0|OH MY GOODNESS!!!!! I love this book soooo much!!!!! Not only was it written well, but there was a great plot too. *******SPOILER!!!****** I just wish that she was leaning more towards one guy instead of toying with them both.... but you have to put something in the third book!! I loved it and recommend it to anyone who loves a love triangle and so action.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|ACTORS WERE GREAT. AND SO IS THE STORY. KEEPS WITH WHAT IS EXPECTED OF THIS ONE.  ENJOY THE SECOND SEASON AS WE DID.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|What the developers won't tell you is that most necessary fonts are not included, and you'll have to pay extra 5 bucks for the font package which usually does not work. I was about to purchase the package when I read the reviews. I'm giving up Office Suite Pro.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this. is the funniest game ever knowned<br />ilove this game so much I could be person the game I would even do any thing to meet the creators
B00CWY76CC|5.0|In my own opinion this game is fabulous and by that I mean it's a really fun game!!! It helped me find my own things when I needed them and they where lost it just helped me a lot<br /><br />Rater chick
0425263924|3.0|I loved the forst two books in the series but this one didnt have enough substance... Enjoyed the smutt but very overloaded with same wording.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Although the individual seasons were bundled up into package, it was too good to pass up.  I enjoyed watching the classics after seeing the latest Into Darkness in the theater.  The digital update and restoration of TOS is fantastic.
B008602KQI|4.0|Disclaimer: I haven't read the book yet.<br /><br />I don't usually watch the movie first, but I did this time. I liked it, but I can't say how I'd feel after having read the book.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|As soon as I downloaded this game my Kindle started having problems, freezing; to the point I would have to do a 20 second reset every time to get it working again. My kindle also started overheating, and it would automatically shut off. I deleted the app and everything started working perfectly again. I DO NOT recommend this game for Kindle users.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I LOVE this app!!  Buffalo Studios is always adding updates to the game, so it never grows stagnant or boring. Absolutely my favorite game on Facebook!
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I lived the details in this book! It was amazing i would recommend  this book to everyone! I love it!
B000NY12LO|2.0|I did not like the way the subject matter was portrayed.  I didn't like the character development and hated the ending.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I heard about Scott Jurek from reading Born to Run, and in reading more about him I was amazed at the distances he is able to cover on foot. I am a runner and try to eat a plant based diet so this book really appealed to me. I liked it because it is a story about a runner, not really a book about running. I also liked that you get to hear about just how normal this guy is. The story's Jurek tells and the people he introduces you to in the book let you know that you don't need to be any kind of super human to run far and run well, you just need to have the desire and put in the effort. Taking care of your body and eating well also helps. Overall, this book will not turn you into and ultramarathoner or a vegan but it should get you excited to get out there and run.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I don't have Facebook so I can't have any friends....  that's why I rated this a 3 star and not a 4 star rating.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I thought it was great ! It was like watching it on Broadway. The costumes, makeup and music wonderful.  Pat
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|I was so excited when I saw this APP. I loved the Atari Games back when!!!! Centipede was my FAVORITE! I would watch the kids play it, then it was time for BED,I stayed up, trying to ring up the points on this game..I looked for Centipede, on the Playstation,and Playstation 2  .My grandson help me find it,then the playstation broke! Well what more can I say,but Amazon,YOU did it again....Thanks so much....I have it on my Tablet and Phone.  jkv
B004WR125O|5.0|Worked very well.  I plugged it in, went to setup Manually, chose my wireless access, entered my Security Password and connected.  I tested and access &#34;Net&#34; from my Onkyo TX-NR818 receiver and was able to access the Network.  Played Pandora music to test and it worked.  Very happy.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Seriously, don't even bother to see it, the book and movie only share the same name. Read the book. It's different and a pretty good read. Not a typical story. It's small interviews that tie together in small or big connections.<br />Not so much about zombies themselves over say, but the people everywhere and anywhere in the world and how they made it through the great panic, like The Walking Dead sort of.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My mission: get 175681664 close calls with a missile and I have no clue how to fret that many and it is a 3 star mission and I don't want to waste 15000 coins<br />But overall it is a great and addicting game
148951418X|5.0|This book helped me to make an awesome time lapse video of myself. It has some great lighting tips and is very clear/easy to understand. Goes much deeper than the manual does. It's a must have!
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Good story line and great acting. This is one of my favorite Mel Gibson movies. The supporting cast was perfect for this movie.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It reminds me of The Gulag Archipelago of a generation ago (mine). Wonderful writing, great insight on completely dominated people. I have myself been through a lighter version of this type of society and he describes it and what it does to people very well. Highly recommended. Note to younger generations: this really does happen. Believe me.
B003Y5USF0|5.0|I just love this movie! If you like action this movie has it all. Great special affects. Helen Hunt did a fantastic job.
B008G59IBI|5.0|It's hard enough to find a band that can consistently put out ONE good album with all great songs on it, but two? Ha, rare. Three? OK, now you're talking crazy. Still here it is, the third album in the series for the band and it is incredible. Some different textures of songs...horns, strings, acoustic. It's advertised sometimes as being the more refined of the three-set, but I didn't get that vibe. It's got some kick in the head rocking songs such as &#34;Little Boy Named Train&#34; and &#34;Dirty Rotten Bastards&#34;, the latter having classic punk rock riffs, multiple key changes and manic lyrics. It makes me wonder...what's next for an encore?
B005K17RU0|5.0|Everything I was looking for. Great App. It is nice to be able to check the weather in a glance a and be able to trust that the report is accurate.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|Lots of past action stars in this second edition of the Expendables series. I expect there to be a third. Rescuing enslaved villagers who have been tasked with finding some lost plutonium while simultaneously paying off a debt is the central plot to this edition. The action is good, and Jean Claude makes a good villain. Arnold and Bruce seem to be a bit uninspired in this movie, although you see them more than in the previous one. A guilty pleasure but just a little flat. Still, if you liked the first one I think you'll like this one too. Lots of shooting and blood splattering if that's your thing. Not quite as violent as a Quentin Tarantino movie.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|One of my alltime favourites, even when there are so much bad critics. But don't worry about it, the movie itself gives you the recipe, what to do with bad critics... (just a joke, i'm a peaceful person)<br /><br />I saw this film above the clouds for the first time, and without a minute of a break for a second time. The special concept of this movie fascinates me so much. But be aware, it is nothing for everybody, you cannot lean back and focus on Coke and popcorn, definitely not. A view to the statistics here says all: there's not a lot between one and five stars, you will love it or hate it. Six different stories are mixed up in a fast cut, and they are connected in any ways, but not clearly evidently. Reincarnation is a theme what bindes the different stories together, although not in the way as you can follow one or another character in his/her direct karmic steps. There is much space left for your own imagination and way of thinking, and that is what i love. I feel that this movie want to activate your thinking about the things we don't know yet and it won't show you a definite message... So i also guess, that exactly this is the point, what confuses so many people.<br /><br />There's no absolute need to read the novel, book and film are two completely different pair of shoes. I like both, and i'm happy, the film doesn't follow the novel 1:1 The book is written in a fix timeline from the oldest story to the newest, always ending abruptely in the middle, and goes back again after reaching the latest future. This works for the written version excellently, but it would not for the film, which is made as when the story would be thrown in a mixer. Makes it speedy and interesting, You're at every moment present in all the six different stories, and that's genious. All the actors play different roles, what confuses the karmic idea much more. They do not follow an exact karmic line. My favourite from the cast is Korean actress Doona Bae. That magical moment, when a tear appears out of her emotionless but emotional face, that moment alone is worth an Oscar. She's definitely predestined for roles as the slave replicant Sonmi 451. Not for the first time she play a role as this one. No need to loose words about all the other well known actors, they do a great job, sorry, they do a lot of great jobs here...<br /><br />A negative point, the only one from my point of view, is the soundtrack. As far as there is with the 'Cloud Atlas Sextett' a 'composition of the century' a main theme in one of the stories, so there should be really a mindblowing soundtrack, but it is not. it's just an ordinary 0815 score. This is not a low budget project, so why does the director (Tykwer) co-write the music? He's not a composer. Following the plot i would recommend to engage two different ones of the great filmmusic composers from today. My imagination: Hans Zimmer and A.R. Rahman could really make it mindblowing...<br /><br />One word about the DVD release: I am always frustrated about the international licence rules. I want to see this movie with the original score in english, and i want to have english subtitles as well, but here in switzerland it is impossible to get this. (at least not for now)<br /><br />My recommendations: If you love complex stories, unorthodox ways of film making and Art Movies, it is a must, to see. If you prefer to relax and get entertained, so safe your time and money and let it be.<br /><br />And finally, to confuse everybody: There is not just one fix theory about reincarnation, there are hundred of different meanings and theories about. The most provocative idea (not from me): There is just one soul, in the whole universe, and the time is not linear... 'Everybody in this world is the same person' (Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, 1952)<br />Think about!ar appears out of her emotionless but emotional face, that moment alone is worth an Oscar.

B004DLPXAO|4.0|So my parents got Kindles a few years ago, and my dad not being the most tech savvy fellow let me have his. I love my Kindle, but there are only so may things that you want to carry with you. I recently started to use the app on my Samsung GS3. The only real fault I have with the app version is there is no TTS. If other programs had the same problem I wouldn't be nearly so annoyed by it, but Google Play Books does have TTS.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book had me crying, laughing, angry, sad, and practically every other emotion. I couldn't put it down! I confirmed over it really badly and will for a long time to come. I'm extremely glad I read this book and recommend it to anyone and everyone.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|It wasn't broke. Where is the easy to see radar?  Elsewhere. Where are the....etc.. Color me bewildered. Your changes are difficult to wade though. To find stuff, like radar...on and on. I bought a better one because you made this too good for me to use. Bye, bye.
B00127RAJY|5.0|If you are looking for a work-out that makes your heart rate go up, this is for you!!! Even level one is very good! I would def recommend as this has 3 different work out levels
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|Okay, in all fairness, I had no idea before hand that this was a possession movie.  I'm all about scary movies, blood, gore, witchcraft even and paranormal crap.  However, I do not do possession flicks.  Nope.  So I only saw about half of this before I had had enough and shut it off.  Not my cup of tea.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|A friend of mine had this, and I just had to get it. It is beyond awesome.<br />Some of the best musicians I've ever seen and best harmonies anywhere. Being a musician myself, watching them perform is amazing....love love love it!
B0095MVOMC|1.0|Very fun and well done hidden numbers game. My only complaint is that it didn't take long to complete. I enjoyed it so much that I bought Hidden Letters. That game is much harder if you are looking for a real challenge!<br /><br />Edit: Well, the game itself is very fun and well done. But after having this on my phone for a few days I think I found everyone's \\"Virus\\". I began getting push ads to the status bar. This is 100% totally unacceptable in a PAID app! I uninstalled and will not be buying anymore apps from a company that thinks this is an okay practice.
B0075LTP6W|3.0|I purchased this on vinyl, brand new. However, upon receiving the album I examined both records and all four sides were severely scratched. I requested a replacement, and the seller quickly shipped out another brand new copy. While the second copy is better there are still what could be described as \\"scuff marks\\" on the edges of the record. I know of at least one other instance, separate from my purchase, where this happened as well. It seems this is a factory defect, possibly due to a careless manufacturing process. It is very disappointing to receive a brand new product, only to have it damaged from the factory. I fear that in trying to keep up with the current trend of re-issuing recordings on vinyl, labels and manufacturers are more concerned with quantity rather than quality. There is no reason for a record album to be scratched and scuffed before it has even been opened!
0316187216|4.0|Some old character favorites and some new faces as well, all in tough situations.  Not much magic to be seen here, just hard people doing a hard job that needs 'doin.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I definitely recommend this if you have a face book  page to manage...convenient and easy to manage anytime and anywhere..
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|I like SciFi, so I thought this movie would be entertaining.  It sure was!  It was kinda confusing at times, but since I dreamed about it the same night, I'm guessing I enjoyed it.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|I've been a long time fan, and I was really looking forward to the new album.  I have not been disappointed!  I like it more every time I listen.  It doesn't feel like Josh and Co. are coasting on past sounds.  It's still clearly Queens, but it seems more mature.  Too soon to tell if it's my second or third favorite QOTSA album.
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I was enchanted with Bella's dress in the movie and wanted to remember it with this doll.  I'm glad I bought it.
B005LAII80|4.0|I went in with low expectations, but was pleasantly surprised.  The premise is somewhat similar to The Raid:Redemption, without being a copy.  The story and scale are relatively straight forward and small.  But I think it helps keep the film focused and it never bogs down.  Urban is great as Dredd, and this reboot easily overshadows Stallone's campy, previous version.  I wish this had done better at the box office because I would love to see more stories in this Dredd universe.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The final installment of the Hunger Sames series has been met with mixed review. I have never felt that Collins was a paramount writer, but the story throughout the series has definitely been intriguing and gripping. The conclusion to the series will be received on both ends--disappointment that certain things were not consummated, to frustration at the resolution of others. All in all, an enjoyable close to a fun and exciting trilogy!
B0014BQQYS|5.0|It's a shame Newman and Redford didn't make ten more films together. But maybe then there'd have been a mediocre one.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I like ordering my books on Kindle and reading them on my new tablet (this is my first time to own something like this, so I am having trouble using it properly). A friend help me get started and ordered the first book, Traps, on cloud, but now I don't know how to get on cloud with the other two books I have downloaded. If you can help me with this I'd appreciate it very much.  Thank you.
B007N31ZLA|5.0|This film is magical. The cast, the direction, the music... Truly magical. It's a film I can watch five minutes of to alter a mood.
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|This is the second book of Colum McCann's I have read.  But, you kind of have to get used to him.  It took me awhile to connect everything and everyone, and then I admired the way he wrote it.  IIt's like in real life that your actions can affect someone or something else, and you may never know about it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It starts out slower than the other two books. Kept me interested with twists and turns. it was a good, easy read.
B008I43DYU|2.0|I am way not smart enough to figure out what a bunch of the buttons do, sorry.  This calculator is way to complicated for me.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|got it right away and I could continue reading seems sturdier than the old one. I thank you very much
0316228532|5.0|Amazing novel. Moving, powerful, you come to feel like you know all the characters. I'm very glad I read this book.
B0027I93U6|5.0|Great season, the show is really picking up after the first one. I can't wait to see what happens in season 3
B004IV32HU|4.0|If you are a Johnny Depp fan this is quite a film to see him hold his role as this complicated real life character Ed Wood...supporting cast Martin Landau and Sarah Jessica Parker and others truly hold up their roles too...a bit lengthy...i did watch over my 3 nite rental...but each time i watched a new section i got more deeply pulled in to the characters...
B001R0O9K4|5.0|This film is a sleeper, and my favorite performance by Liam Neeson.  By following the figure of Michael Collins, played by Neeson, one sees the events which created the Irish Free State.  The film begins with the Easter rebellion of 1916, and shows the bloody battle of assassination waged by the IRA and British authorities.  The film is mostly a political thriller, but there is good action throughout the film.  One is left at the end wondering who the good guys really were, if any.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I am an older listener who bought this CD for the &#34;Get Lucky&#34; track but I ended up enjoying the whole CD. It's more mellow than I thought but has a wonderful bass beat that enhances the songs, making you want to move to the music.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game to be very challenging and exciting to play.  My daughter and I both downloaded it and played together.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he loves it!  Not sure how many times he's viewed it, but I hear it playing all of the time!
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|If you happen to start on Castle mid series, you will certainly enjoy going back to the beginnings.  Watching the characters develop and grow is especially fun.  You'll love adding this to your dvd collection.
B0093X805W|5.0|I read this to my 8 and 7 year old boys, and they were begging me to keep reading more and more. Loved this book!!
B00AAQWMB4|5.0|What a simple and easy to learn game.  Very playable right out of the gate.  Not only did I fallen love with it but so has just about everyone I have introduced to it.  I am looking forward to updated versions where you can pass the device and play against others (we sort of figured out how by playing as another color first then passing the device).  Anyway, Great game keep up the good work and let's see an unplugged version by Christmas.
B00DE76PM8|4.0|As a geographicly/selling challenged traveler I w as delighted to find my way around S.C. with no difficulty. It was more accurate than my GPS. I liked being able to find restuarants and sight and storing them. It Wadsworth the price
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is the best game in the world I recommend it for every body that likes. temple run or subway surfer
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This was a fun movie that provided a good story line with a lot of action to keep the pace moving.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Very interesting.  I recommend this book for anyone interested in knowing where their food comes from.  This book has changed how I look at food.
0060527986|5.0|It feels like Paolo Coelho had carefully chewed on every Word before writing it.<br />This is really a Handbook and a great Tool for gaining wisdom.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|One of the best ways to keep up and in touch with family and old AND new friends. Great place to find beautiful photos from all over the world and awesome quotes. Of course, as with ANY site with full freedoms, you get some crap, too. Depends on what you want to use it for.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The Hunger Games is a deep and emotional trilogy where each book leaves you clamoring for the next. Suzanne Colins puts her characters through a lot in these books and, honestly I can not comprehend how she could possibly conceive of such an intriguing and deep a story. I highly recommend this book for teen and adult readers.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|one of the best games I have. It is adicting! cant stop playing it. love the minoins on this game.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Like, seriously. The quality (I watched it in HD) is really good, and the show is SO GOOD. Gotta love The Good Wife.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun little towny game centered around building up towns anf finding the EOH. Great for wasting a little extra time.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|After the house of Anubis movie the touchstone of ra Joy and Jerome started to date but Jerome started to cheat on her with Kt since she has no boyfriend. Joy cried and cried every night because Jerome cheated on her. Fabian was always into smart stuff and never wanted to spend time with Mara so she dumped him. Later that day Fabian and Joy bumped into each other and had their second kiss. Fabian and Joy started to date and lived happily ever after.
B00992CF6W|3.0|this game is very fun. I play it 24/7. but why can't  we get faster updates androids and old alrady have version 0 7 2 while I'm waiting for it for the kindle fire HD
0345529057|5.0|The way Martin stands accepted tropes of fantasy on their heads is very rewarding, and his main characters are fully realized and defy sterotyping.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book will change your perspective of how you look at life. It makes you want to not be afraid of what others say.

B000VSYDRM|5.0|Imaginative, wonderfully written story.<br />Brilliant story line to stimulate your every sense.<br />You wont find another plot like this, in this day of age of copycat movie making.
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|This is a game that you have to use your logic to out maneuver your opponent . I like it well
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|An easy to play game.  I've enjoyed play mahjong on my pc over the years and now it's nice to have it to play on my KindleFire, especially since it was free.
B00770KR7W|5.0|This was a Christmas gift I bought for a family member; as far as I know they really like it. I have received no complaints or concerns from them.
B001J32H6M|3.0|Probably Williams' greatest film score exploding creativity and intensity - a marvel to behold. Unfortunately, for this reissue, something has been changed as far as the mix is concerned, same go's for the track editing. I have cdr copies of an earlier release (source unknown) of Temple of Doom and its overall a more exciting and gratifying listening experience. Several of the best ques have a different mix then what's heard on my cherished cdr copy, for instance (and this is a biggie) the brass is not as loud and dominant, same go's for some of the percussion, in addition I noticed the piccolo's don't scream as loud.  This is less intense than before.  The ques most affected by this new mix are the Night Club Fight and Car Chase sequence, and they almost don't even sound like the same music at all, the menace is missing, its power has been utterly castrated on these ques. Sadly the ever popular Minecart sequence has less zip as well (piccolos sound dialed down in the mix). Also and very noticeably the brass is not as hot sounding as before during the sequence on the cliff, immediately before the rope bridge sequence. I like real hot aggressive sounding brass, but thanks to this  new mix  that sizzle (that my older copy has in spades) is very tame sounding on the 2008 reissue. I can say the new disc does edge out the vaunted older disc in terms of clarity - but only by a little. Kate Capshaw's voice is amazingly articulate sounding and projects better then ever, as its the first track you'll notice that right away and it certainly helped build of my anticipation; hoping for the best sounding Temple of Doom I've yet heard - only to be disappointed. The proof of it all is that I get a ADRENALINE RUSH when spinning the superior (more intense) cdr, whereas the new reissue does NOT provide any rush.<br /><br />Track Editing is another issue, many of these tracks used to merge together and beautifully so - but now they have momentum-killing gaps in between them. I hate that. And has anyone noticed the Sacrifical Chant que is a whole two tracks out of sequence, chronologically speaking. With all these complaints you'd think I didn't like it all, but it's Temple of Doom and there's always a lot to like no matter what. Just a shame these unexpected mix/editing issues have to mar this almighty masterpiece.<br /><br />Unbeknownst to me Temple of Doom was recorded in digital sound, that's a surprise, I have more and more respect all the time now for the capabilities and resulting sound quality of early (1983/1984) digital recording technology. Some say digital still sounds sub-standard, I'm not one of them.  Overall grade 6 star music, 3 star mixing/editing.<br /><br />One last thing: If you love John Williams score for Temple of Doom I suggest you look for older issues perhaps going as far back as vinyl editions, they are more true to the music as-heard-in-the-movie.

B001DUDKEY|5.0|Good cast for this Austen novel.  Enjoyed seeing Sophie Thompson portray Mary Musgrove which is much different than her Miss Bates character in Emma.  There are many recognizable actors that I have enjoyed in other British productions.  As per usual the costumes and settings draw the me in as more than a spectator but rather as one of the party - be it dinner at the table or visiting Bath.

B00CEIWR0M|2.0|After this and the Scarlet Letter as assigned reading for the summer (for a HS literature class), I wouldn't be surprised if my daughter decides never to read another book.  I'm reading with her so we can talk about the books.  We had a good conversation about how women's lives have changed.  But we spent more time talking about how boring the book is to read.
B00B2166BS|4.0|I like the magnetic attachment and divot that tells how it is oriented. Can easily put it on in the dark. Charges faster than using the micro usb. Works fine with the case when it is laid open or in reading mode. Because of the magnet, it pops off easily if you brush up against something or close the case on it. There is no damage.<br /><br />Gets in the way when case is used to prop up the tablet. If you flip it, you cannot get to the power and volume buttons on the Nexus 10. Makes me wish for a dedicated cradle with the magnetic attachment. If it had powered speakers, it would be perfect.

B001TWT0AE|5.0|The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance is a John Ford Western and like many of that great film-maker's efforts, it is a model of literary and artistic excellence.<br /><br />This movie stars Jimmy Stewart (playing Ransom Stoddard), John Wayne (Tom Doniphan, Vera Mills (Hallie), & Lee Marvin (Liberty Valance).  They are supported by a first rate cast of co-Stars who paint a wholly real and serious picture of the settling of the west.<br /><br />The movie is told as a flashback.  Senator Stoddard and his wife Hallie return to their hometown of Shinbone to attend a funeral for an obscure man.  The story is told to the press as follows:<br /><br />Ransom Stoddard, a Yankee Lawyer who is brutalized in a hold-up by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin).  Stoddard is rescued by Tom Doniphan.  Doniphan is an early pioneer of the area and operates a modest horse breeding business.  Stoddard is taken in by Hallie who nurses him back to health.  As Stoddard starts to build his legal practice he earns his keep washing dishes for Hallie and is thus in an apron for most of the movie.<br /><br />Liberty Valance meanwhile engages on a spree of murder and robbery.  There is a sense that he is working for the big ranchers who wish to avoid statehood and keep the range open and keep alive the law of the hired gun.<br /><br />Stoddard's budding legal practice expands into school teaching and his operations win him admirers in the press & enmity from Liberty Valance and the big ranchers \\"north of the Picket Wire.\\"  Stoddard is thus the bearing on which the conflict between the corporate big-operator ranchers & the middle class pioneering families turns.  In this conflict, Stoddard takes up his fate and shoots Liberty Valance, thus launching his meteoric political and legal career, and winning the hand of Hallie.<br /><br />Only he didn't actually shoot Liberty Valence, Tom Doniphan did.  Doniphan doesn't get credit for the deed, and his life spins ever downward.<br /><br />The story is a mere prop that allows for the exploration of many complex themes.  It explores the cooperation of the press and politicians.  In this movie that link is used for \\"good\\" but it can easily be inferred that the opposite is true.  This movie shows that \\"The Law\\" is what brings order to the frontier, but it also equally states the opposite.  \\"The Law\\" works because the lawyer uses selected violence to cut away the disorder.  \\"The Law\\" is therefore underpinned by force.  The entire movie lays bare myth and its essential aspect of society.<br /><br />In this movie the symbolism runs thick, Ransom kills Liberty and in doing so brings order.  There are many other symbolic actions in the film which makes this movie a work of high philosophical literature and storytelling.  Quite possibly one of the best Western movies ever made.<br /><br />Unrelated to the story is John Wayne's voice, within two years of this movie Wayne would lose a lung to cancer and it is clear in retrospect that his heavy smoking is catching up to him.t allows for the exploration of many complex themes.

B00CBSYDSE|5.0|I accidentally stumbled upon Scale the Summit's work. The changes, progressions and all-around tone are energetic, inspiring and very unique. I wouldn't really compare to other progressive metal bands, because I think this kind of music is just progressive instrumental with metal undertones. So, adventure metal is OK I guess, if you have to classify this style.<br /><br />There is no denying these guys are students of music and great artists. It's evident from the first few measures of each piece.  Bass-playing is solid, 7-string guitars just sound superb, timing is impeccable and sound production sounds very professional.<br /><br />I will most probably be checking their earlier albums too. Great music for car rides, working out, doing chores, you name it. There's a little bit of everything for anytime of the day here. Just missed their tour, but will be checking my radar for future tour dates. Their live performance will probably be cool.<br /><br />Enjoy listening!
0375851569|5.0|Offers all the classic books that my 3 year old loves to read. The rhymes are catchy and easy for her to pick up. We read and recite these over and over so they're great for dictation.
B00D41H2PS|3.0|I enjoyed the mystery of this puzzle game but it takes so long to go back and fourth between scenes it got frustrating. Ihad no choice but to hunt down the walk through and realized the piece I am missing is the weight in the barn. After trying several times, and  from several areas on my tablet I CAN NOT PICK UP THE WEIGHT!!! and you need it to move on. Iam going to ask for a refund for this reason. Took 1 star for the slowness, took 1 star for frustration of tring so many times to get the weight. I was good up to that point.

Sorry to have wasted my money on this book and my time.

B0070066DI|5.0|I built into the Silverstone GD05 HTPC Case.  Because of height restrictions, fan options were limited.  After extensive research I settled on this particular fan.<br /><br />This fan works just fine.  My CPU temperatures are great, even though it's sometimes warm in this upstairs office.  I installed it on top of an Intel 3570k and have had no issues whatsoever in the six months my system has been running.<br /><br />Regarding RAM clearance.  Full-height G.Skill Ripjaws fit in banks 2 and 4.  If you plan to use banks 1 & 3 go with low profile memory.  Overheating should not be a problem.<br /><br />For installation, I recommend looking at videos on Youtube.  This was my first build and it went smooth.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I enjoyed this game but I wish free meant free. The graphics are amazing and the story is easy to follow. I enjoyed the choice to play dominoes instead of a hidden object scene also. I hope that leaving this review actually does get me the sequel like it promises.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|Told in interview style , jumping randomly to different stories of the zombie war. At first the book is interesting telling the stories of the early days of the infection. As the stories evolve into wartime stories the book is weighed down into familiar and overused observatons of our way of life. Enjoyed the book &#34;the passage&#34; by justin cronin as a better telling of post apopolyptic society.
1780721676|5.0|I did it because my triglycerides was very high and I was very worried. My doctor prescribed medication, but when I got it the side effects was very dangerous so I did not take it.  I watched the author of this book in a television interview and he said that this diet would help with many health issues. Well, after 4 months I lost 15 pounds and my triglycerides went from 350 to 120. On my  two fasting days I do not eat anything until 5:00 PM,then I eat a 500 calories meal.The other five days I eat what I want, but I noticed that I am eating way less and I do not feel that hungry anymore (I have no idea why) I want to stop this diet because I am losing too much weight and getting too thin, but I am apprehensive if I stop the fasting I will lose the health benefits.

B005ERIRZE|5.0|I really found this book useful in my personal life. The ideas were expressed well with interesting illustrations and antidotes. I was able to try some of Kelly's suggestions and train myself in areas of self-control. I highly recommend this book.
B00B3EJ0OY|5.0|It has it all.  Italian, Comedy, Romance, Family, History, Heartache, and Life... Beautiful and Tragic Life.  This movie will leave you smiling through the tears.  Well done from the opening line to the final \\"prego.\\"
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This is the Radio Version of &#34;Get Lucky&#34; by Daft Punk and Pharrell Williams. If you want the album version (which is a bit longer) or one of the remixes stop now, and look for one of those on Amazon. This song is incredibly catchy and has a great bass line.<br /><br />Pharrell Williams is definitely on a roll this summer with &#34;Blurred Lines&#34; with Robin Thicke (which has some of the same grooviness this track does) the other song competing for summer song of 2013. I think this song is catchier and a bit more dancy.<br /><br />Definitely worth the $1.29!
0151013837|4.0|I am thrilled to have my own personal copy of Life of Pi.  Before receiving the book, I expected the illustrations to be absolutely first rate.  The book jacket gave me great hope of finding even more beautiful drawings and illustrations.  What I discovered was that Tomislav Torjanac won an international competition in 2006 to illustrate the book;  I would have preferred someone with a different skill set who uses colors more effectively.  Aside from this minor complaint, the book is still spectacular.
0156029065|4.0|I generally enjoyed this book. However, I would say that the passages of theological arguments and discussions, while appropriate to the period in which the piece was set, did get tedious at times.<br />Probably the best feature of the book was its perspective. Books are often written from a first person perspective with no rational reason why the narrator would have written down his or her experiences. By having Baudolino instead telling his story to the eventual historian, not only did the story it self make more sense, but the tense of the narration was more logical and thus the required suspense of disbelief was easier to achieve.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Fantastic story of the humanity of a German Fighter Ace who places concern for others above his own ambitions for counting kills. Even greater when he and the pilot of the B-17 crew he spares meet years later and become friends. A true example of Christian values superceding the fanatical Nazi policies of his day.
0307346617|5.0|I saw the film before I read the book and the two are as different as night is to day. The only thing in common is the struggle between humans and zombies that hunger for human flesh due to a virus worse that SARS or HIV will ever be.<br /><br />The Zombie Virus is our worst nightmare. Instead of going into details about characters and the plot, I'll focus on what I felt about the audio book.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film but listening to the book left me admiring the author's creative and vividly detailed imagination as the main character moves around the world interviewing survivors of the global war against the infected, hunger driven zombies.<br /><br />Although the story is told through these interviews, the individual stories are attention grabbing--some more than others.<br /><br />A number of themes run through the novel: one points out how governments are often incompetent; corrupt and how many of the people panic and make disastrous mistakes as a mob. Another theme focuses on survivalist and disaster preparation.<br /><br />I bought and listened to the audio book and the cast of characters is incredible. I found the listening experience to be more powerful than watching the film and possibly more powerful than reading the book on paper. The cast of characters is long and their talent adds to the novel.<br /><br />If you have a fascination with war, I don't see how you can resist this novel.  The stories shared in this oral history of World War Z are as violent as they get.  World War I and II, Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan cannot compete with the combat that you will witness as a reader in this novel.  Imagine an enemy that can't die unless you cut off its head or blow apart its brain.  And all it wants to do is chew on living humans infecting them. Viruses are like that. They find ways to spread and replicate just as the Zombie Virus does in this novel.<br /><br />I awarded this novel 5-stars because of the amazing imagination of the author that never failed to impress me. If there were awards for imagination, Max Brooks deserves one. In fact, the audio book--that I highly recommend--won an Audie Award in 2007 for the performance of a cast of more than forty that includes Alan Alda, Mark Hamill, Carl Reiner, Bruce Boxleitner,  Rob Reiner, Jon Turturro, Masayori Oka (NBC's Heroes), and Martin Scorsese.<br /><br />I couldn't find the complete edition Audio Book I bought of World War Z on Amazon.

0446615641|4.0|I'm not reading the Camel Club series in order. \\"Stone Cold\\" is the third book in the series. I read number one, \\"The Camel Club\\" and then four, \\"Divine Justice\\" first.<br /><br />Well, I didn't really read them. I'm listened to the audio books when I was in the car. It seems that these days, I read more books with my ears than with my eyes.<br /><br />In fact, I enjoy listening to books when I drive and reading the Camel Club series out of order didn't cause me to enjoy it less.<br /><br />\\"Stone Cold\\" moves fast. Friendship and loyalty are a strong theme in the Camel Club series and in this novel, Oliver Stone, the main character whose real name is John Carr was once a CIA assassin--the best it seems--in an elite unit. When he quit the CIA, his wife was killed and he was supposed to die, but he survived and has been on the run using the alias of Oliver Stone as he waits for the right moment to seek justice.<br /><br />In \\"Stone Cold\\", he gets some of that justice and he isn't alone. The Camel Club members are Reuben Rhodes, a West Point graduate and Vietnam vet; Caleb Shaw, who works in the rare book wing of the Library of Congress; Milton Farb, who was a child prodigy with math but grew up to have extreme obsessive-compulsive disorder and paranoia; Alex Ford, a Secret Service Agent, and Annabelle Conroy, a master scam artist.<br /><br />John Carr, aka Oliver Stone, is willing to risk his life and face death for the other members of the Camel Club but the others are also willing to risk it all out of loyalty for their leader, Oliver Stone.<br /><br />One of the themes that runs through the series is that men who have gained positions of power in government--especially in the intelligence community [for example, the CIA]--have too much power and the ability to abuse that power.<br /><br />Considering the history of the CIA helping to support dictatorships and assassinating world leaders of other countries, this probably isn't far from the truth. In fact, according to Global Research and Tru TV--with some evidence listed--the CIA has attempted to assassinate 50 foreign leaders and sometimes succeeds. It's called legalized murder.<br /><br />If you enjoy suspense-thrillers, then I highly recommend this series.<br /><br />I have two books left to read/listen to in the Camel Club series: \\"The Collectors\\" and \\"Hell's Corner\\". I bought a copy of \\"Stone Cold's\\" audio book.<br /><br />A word about the rating system that I have borrowed and adapted from Alice Wakefield in an attempt to keep the star-rating system meaningful:<br /><br />* 4 stars from me are high praise, meaning I enjoyed the novel and recommend it.<br />* 3 stars mean I enjoyed the book and recommend it with some reservations.<br />* 5 stars are reserved for that rare work that reaches the level of a classic, such as a National Book Award, a Pulitzer or a Nobel Prize winner that compares to a Steinbeck or Mark Twain, which means the author impressed me beyond and above the average, entertaining book.<br /><br />Note: I usually do not award books 1 or 2 stars because if a book is that bad, I won't finish it.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|Sherlock comes off as an antisocial individual who acts as if he is smarter and better than everyone around him often insulting others. But I think he may be somewhat autistic and his lack of social graces is his way to hide from a world that he doesn't fit in.<br /><br />I enjoyed season one and bought season two and will wait for season three to come out and buy it too.  In this season, we see Sherlock learning to trust Dr. Watson, Mrs. Hudson (his landlady) and Molly Hooper (lab tech in local hospital who has a crush on Sherlock).  It isn't easy for Sherlock to allow others to get close to him but it seems he is thinking of these few people as his friends and someone he can trust. Detective Inspector Lestrade may be part of this short list--he certainly seems loyal to Sherlock no matter how insulting Sherlock is to him.<br /><br />What I found really neat was Dr. Watson starting a Blog about Sherlock Holmes and the cases they both deal with and solve.

B009WUBERW|1.0|We shut it off in the first 5 minutes. The dialogue was awful, the acting was terrible and the opening sequence was too much. Don't get me wrong, I like cheesy action movies, but this was BAD.
B00BSBUZT6|5.0|History of the Eagles is very good behind the scenes look for long time Eagles fans. The guys are very open about telling the story of the band and their personalities really come through. I went to the Louisville concert with high expectations after seeing the video and it made the concert even more exciting. If you are an Eagles fan you need the History of the Eagles in your collection.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I have been a long time fan of John Grisham. He lost me a while back in the middle with The Painted House and a couple of others but this book was like I never left...I think I missed a couple before this one that I'm going to download onto my kindle. If Mr Grisham were standing before me I would say...Don't fix what isn't broken...ever again! I love the courtroom drama, the wheeling and dealing and the action behind the closed doors of the conference rooms and judges chambers that mere mortals don't get a chance to observe in reality. I love the way his characters come to life on the pages and the way he keeps making me turn the pages until the wee hours of the morning. I love this book and would recommend it. For me it got a little bit boring in the middle and took a little bit to get where it was going at times, but a very juicy and satisfying read overall. I gave it four stars because it still didn't live up to The Firm which is my favorite of all and I can't help comparing the rest to that masterpiece.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game especially for being free graphics are great power up are awesome as well a lot of other games don't go nearly in depth as this one
B0063S3DMK|5.0|Have always loved this movie, and just watched it with my 8 year old son, and he liked it as well.  The girl in this movie is a great actress, and she is a great role model for children and adults as well.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is by far the best TV series I've watched in a LONG time. Granted, I'm not a big TV watcher, but Downtown Abbey had me in their grasp from episode 1 of season 1. Who would've ever thought there could me so much scandal and drama?! :) I can't wait for Season 4.

B00DC7N9NS|4.0|..then id recommend this.  has great similarities to the original OZ but doesnt go to far.  story lines are good and the acting is good. james franco does a good job.  this is one of those eye candy movies.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Its technically horror but so a romance movie. The best part is watching R run. He's always in zombie mode, totally makes the movie.
0345803493|5.0|So when I purchased this book it said good condition since it was used but turns out it looked like if it was new. Really great buy. Cheap and affordable.
0393927938|5.0|Its a novel which I don't think many of the young generation have read since the depiction of Frankenstein is pretty much done in mainstream culture(big ugly green man). The modern depictions of the monster does not due the book true justice and if you are curious on why this is considered one of the classic novels of human history you have to pick it up and read it. It novel still has teams that still very relevant to our modern society. 5/5 Masterpiece.
0345803485|4.0|Almost like new. The book was bent a little but overall it was great. Defiantly worth the price it was.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|I  just Love Love Love this movie. I went to the Movies to see it  43 yrs. ago and fell in love with it.  I watched it every time it was on TCM , recorded ,it and watched it over and over. Now that I have my Kindle I can watch it  when ever or where ever I choose. The songs are just wonderful and it is better then a CD because I can see Barbara singing. I just love ,love, love her. Patti

0062119044|5.0|Gem of a book YES!! A 5 star without a doubt YES!! But certainly not a re-readable book (for ME)!! Period!!<br /><br />This was THE most Distressing, Disquieting yet Intriguing book I have ever read! And definitely was not an easy read nor it was easy to keep it aside once I started, it really perplexed me at times or rather many times. But not a re readable because I have read almost every page of this book enough times already to do it again!<br /><br />The format used in this book was very unusual yet appropriate I can't think of any other better way by which this story could have been told or would have made sense to the readers apart from knowing a mother's POV. The author has done a superb job by holding the suspense till the end. At first it was really hard for me to get a grip; it was like a jigsaw puzzle it took me a while to arrange everything into place!<br />The perplexity increased every time as I went on reading I cannot say I didn't connect with Eva I did... the thoughts in her mind was relevant to some extent yes.. however still there was something irrelevant about it too.<br /><br />First of all Eva never wanted to have a child.. yes.. quite logical coz she was not prepared for it NOT YET but the fact that she `had' after knowing she was not prepared was the most stupidest thing she ever did and the reasons for which she wanted was even more bizarre. Just because she was alone waiting for her husband made her want another person (not to forget) `a part of him' to go through the ache what she was going through was totally absurd reason to have a child. The hatred which grew on her every moment once Kevin was born was again awful. She always.. I mean ALWAYS.. looked Kevin as a competition?? Or a villain who changed her entire life?? Sure becoming a mother does affect a women's entire life but the part of accepting the changes takes a women into another level that is `the motherhood' which Eva never tried to accept in Kevin's case though she became more matured when she had her daughter but the perception about Kevin never changed for her. In the end it took a LOT to understand Kevin.<br /><br />About Kevin ..Was he really different from other kids?? Or was he like this because of Eva?? I never came to know. Although Kevin knew he was not his mother's favorite but he very well knew he was his dads'.. he could have given more importance to his dads' feelings rather than punishing his mom for her hatredness towards him... these are only `some' questions which came in to my mind while reading but when finally Eva asks Kevin her deepest question his answers shows that he was after all just a mentally disturbed, impulsive kid at the end.<br /><br />According to me blame game doesn't work here. If we really want to blame something then we should begin with what goes inside everyone's mind/brain/thinking which is anything else but predictable and is indeed a darkest secret in itself irrespective of ones age, either it can bring the darkest demon in you or a beautiful angel!
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|Let me start off by saying that I LOVE the original 'Evil Dead' Trilogy by Sam Raimi. I'm not like the angry people who immediately dismiss remakes of classic horror movies because they aren't the same as the original. Well remakes aren't supposed to be the same or better than the original. I loved the spirit of this raunchy creepy gore filled remake/re-imagining of 'Evil Dead'. Sadly main character of Ash is totally gone. But I gave it a chance. A good horror movie is a good horror movie. Sure we had the horrible remakes, but there have been some good ones.<br /><br />Synopsis:<br />After an intense introduction which involves a sort of Exorcism, we are introduced to the main characters. The iconic lead character of Ash played by Bruce Campbell is replaced by the female lead of Mia played by newcomer Jane Levy and Shiloh Fernandez as her brother. Many are enraged by this change, but I accepted it. I mean honestly, it would be even worse if they decided to remake the Ash character with a new actor. Seriously, no one can fill Bruce Campbells shoes. That being said, I was actually impressed with the approach the film takes this go-round.  5 friends gather at a Cabin to help one of the group, Mia, overcome her drug addiction.  As the hours go by she gets edgy and they discover a basement full of witchcraft type items.  One of the group brings out a book and starts to read from it.  This is when the demons start to take over.  As the movie progresses I honestly felt the movie didn't really have a lead character because 3 of the 5 characters seem to become equally important.<br /><br />The imagery is beautifully gruesome. The tension builds up in creeping terror fashion until the scares start to get louder and more prominent toward the end. There are even certain aspects of the remake that pay great homage to the original Evil Dead.  The quick shot of the Chainsaw.  The implication that the girls hand will become possessed like Ashes hand. The terrifyingly creepy cellarscenes. The demonic Necronomicon book of the dead is present of course. When the guy reads from the book you know right away that horror is about to follow. The movie has a constant feeling of dread from that moment on.  There are some scenes that will make people laugh, but for the most part, this movie was relentless horror! The movie also had a little heart. There were certain scenes that will bring out emotions in the audience and make you think \\"What would I do if that happened to me and my loved ones?\\" I admit there was a part where I almost felt a tear forming in my eye.<br />The make up effects are disgustingly real. Don't see this movie if you have a weak stomach. I read that they refrained from using CGI effects in this movie to stay true to the spirit of the old school approach of the original. I loved that they chose to do that. The demons in this had the true 'Evil Dead' feel to them. I was so creeped out the entire movie. The faces of the demons are some of the scariest images since \\"The Exorcist\\".  I felt like a kid again watching \\"The Exorcist\\" for the first time. The voices of the demons will surely haunt most viewers for nights. I definitely closed my closet door after seeing this movie. The directing is clever and creepy. This movie has a lot of good examples of how a horror movie should be made. The actors and actresses give believable performances. The actress who plays 'Mia' was so good in her terrorized and demonic performance. Sure sometimes the characters made stupid decisions, but come on, we all remember the part when the girl walked into the woods alone just because she 'heard something' in the original Evil Dead right? If the characters don't make at least one stupid decision in a movie, then there wouldn't be a horror movie right? I can tell the filmmakers put a lot of effort into this movie. The filmmakers knew how the fan base of the original trilogy would react to certain things. I'm glad that the original director Sam Raimi and original star Bruce Campbell helped a lot with production for this movie. They also had help from Robert Tapert, the producer of the original. If they weren't there to supervise, I can tell this movie wouldn't have been half as good as it is.<br /><br />This is definitely the best horror remake. Also one of the best and goriest horror movies released nationwide in theaters.  This made the Saw movies seem \\"PG\\". The movie has that 'independent' feel of the original while also having a mainstream feel at the same time. I really appreciated this movie. I even cared for the characters. Not like most horror movies where you can't wait to see the characters die. I wanted these characters to live. It was a great tragic movie, just like the original. It terrified me and made me and the audience at the theater cringe and wanna cover our eyes.  Watching this movie with a crowd of people is the best way to experience it. I haven't had that much fun at a theater in a LONG time. I encourage you to see it with at least 3 other people. Turn up the volume, and have fun.  The quality of the Blu Ray really brought the horror to life at home too!<br /><br />I do have slight criticisms.  I like to believe the movie is set in modern times.  But I didn't see a single Cell Phone.  Also regarding that, it would've been nice and more modern if at least one character said \\"There's no service out here\\", because a lot of people in the theater kept saying \\"Why don't they just call 911?\\".  Another thing is, after their hot lady friend is killed first, they just forget about it right away.  As if it was nothing tragic!  Other than that, this movie is legit horror though!<br /><br />All in all, don't dismiss it as just another pointless horrible remake. Give it a chance. Don't over analyze every single detail just to criticize the movie, even though I pointed out minor things that bugged me.  I see too many people just destroying this movie by dissecting every little detail that they didn't like.  Butmost of all, DON'T keep comparing it to the original.<br />P.S. Stay after the credits. There's a nice treat for 'Evil Dead' fans waiting.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Blur the lines of imagination and reality and this is what you get, a great story about a young boys memory of a few days when he was seven. If you like his previous work, you're going to like this lighthearted take on childhood and imagination.
B000SW4DH6|5.0|Thought it was going to be pretty dumb in the beginning but when Christian and Satine started singing &#34;Come what may&#34; I was amazed. It just have so much suspense. 5/5 movie!
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|I am a huge fan of both Maggie Smith and Billy Connolly so I couldn't wait to see this movie.  I was not disappointed.  My son is a huge fan of Opera as am I but even if you are not, you will be drawn into this film by the story and the brilliant acting of this fine cast.  Dustin Hoffman makes his directorial debut and I can only say I certainly hope he continues, because this was a sweet, funny film about older ones that manages to bring out the frustration of getting older without wallowing in bitterness.  You will be drawn in immediately to this story of Jean, the prima donna descending upon this lovely home for older artists and the havoc she creates with her presence.  I love the line, \\"I had 12 curtain calls.\\"  To which Jean replies, \\"No my dear, you had nine.  I had twelve.\\" They try to persuade her to be part of the quartet and sing a piece but she is such a perfectionist she is loath to sing and accept her voice as she has aged.  These lovely people manage finally to get her to agree to be part of their gala but it is quite an interesting journey. Beautifully done, and even if you are not aware of it, I really loved the way they told us how many talented people from the opera were in the film in the credits.  This is a movie you will watch again and again.  I loved it.
B002AWX6UM|3.0|I enjoyed this book for its deep insight of both the person and the history. I'm not much of a reader but I did get pulled in so it must be good.
B00D6BQG1W|5.0|Characters and actors make a good story really enjoyable with superb comedic skills and  thoroughly entertaining direction.  Not much of a campy feel, more of an expert sarcasm with a ton of wit.

B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|Rented it on-demand...and ordered the blu-ray while watching.  Overkill?  Probably.  But this movie is vintage good/bad Arnold action.  Get some popcorn, a trough of soda or some beers and turn your brain off for an hour and a half to mindlessly enjoy great action and one-liners the way the 80's used to make'em
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Pros:<br />Comfortable fit<br />Cheap, yet fitting materials<br />Easy set-up and navigation with drivers<br />Full range of customizable buttons, light, and macro capability<br />Price<br />Plenty of extra weights<br /><br />Cons:<br />Only light that can be changed is the Anker logo<br />Could use better key setup on the left side of mouse<br />Not as many customization buttons as expected, there's really only 3-5 that you would change without losing functions of a normal mouse<br /><br />I'd say this mouse, for it's value, is easily a 5-star mouse. Although it does have some flaws they are very minor and should not sway you from what this mouse has to offer. $40.00 is an amazing deal I recommend the mouse to any people looking for something new with great quality!<br /><br />Hope to see Anker getting more into the field of gaming accessories as this mouse has shown me that they can compete with the best.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|This was my first Stephen King book and I was pleasantly surprised.  I admit I was quite intimidated by King 's monstrous sized SciFy novels,especially since I'm not a huge fan of SciFy. I am a history buff though and this book interested me.  I appreciated his in depth research and thought put into this novel. Again not a huge fan of ScyFi, but I could not put this book down.  Lots of twists and turns. Overall really great book.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|When I finally got the chance to watch all the Marvel movies together, of the ones that have come out lately, I expected Thor to be the weakest of the entries in the series.  I was very pleasantly surprised in a lot of ways.  When it comes to this Blu-Ray/DVD combo + Digital Copy, it has to be said that the quality of an HD viewing really is your best bet.  There are a lot of visual effects including entire digitally-created sets that are highly detailed, fantastic, and gorgeous in high definition.<br /><br />The movie itself has moments of pure fantasy that remind me of a Final Fantasy game, with scenes of action worthy of any good superhero film, plus large-scale battle sequences reminiscent of the Lord of the Rings films.  We have a storyline similar to the '80s movie (and TV show) Starman, and the acting is top-notch.  (Sir!) Anthony Hopkins does an excellent job of portraying a father torn by the pain of seeing his sons in turmoil, unable to learn the lessons that will bring them into adulthood.  Chris Hemsworth captures the angry-young-man impulsiveness and yet still shows such compassion and chivalry that any fan of romance will truly enjoy the love story--and he is definitely as physically fit as a god.  The only real drawback to the acting is that Natalie Portman has to struggle to be relevant in the midst of so many different story elements (though I do believe she is a great actress).  It's especially entertaining to see Tom Hiddleston  (as Loki) mischeviously steal nearly every scene he's in.<br /><br />While I'm not steeped in Thor's mythos, I have to give credit to the story's writers for taking the Arthur C. Clarke approach to depicting the world of Asgard:  they simply appear to be so very technologically advanced from our society that their technology is indistinguishable from magic.  Part of the fun in this particular movie is its connection to the other Marvel films:  with Iron Man 1 & 2, the Hulk films and Captain America, 'Thor' sets the stage for The Avengers:  it has pieces of the storyline from the other movies dropped into the main story in a very interesting way.<br /><br />If you've seen one or more of the Marvel superhero films that tie into The Avengers, see 'em all.  I don't buy many movies these days, but Thor is definitely a Blu-Ray worth owning.  It is not my favorite film in the series, but it is definitely far better than I expected it to be.or The Avengers:  it has pieces of the storyline from the other movies dropped into the main story in a very interesting way.<br /><br />If you've seen one or more of the Marvel superhero films that tie into The Avengers, see 'em all.

B00DSTRJKY|5.0|I got Apple with Raven and she has an apple purse that really opens and her ribbon ring comes off if you move her hand too much. Its small so be careful not to lose it. Her stand matches her key and her hair is so pretty but I don't suggest brushing or her curls will go away and will become frizzy. Her crown and Necklace come off if you take the rubber bands off. Apple's clothes are easier to change and don't require removing her head or hands she's very beautiful to look at and to play with. I can't wait for more clothes and things for her.<br /><br />- From Robert's Daughter

His characters inhabit the real world and  their jobs just happen to involve gathering the ordinary information that will eventually reveal a much bigger picture.

1476733953|2.0|This tries to be a science fiction tale, but the science part is woefully weak.  For example, at one point the heroine descends several hundred feet under water using what amounts to an old fashioned hard hat diving suit.  It's supplied by a small gasoline powered air compressor one person can carry.  When the compressor fails she just returns to the surface.  Even two hundred feet depth requires exotic breathing gasses and heavy duty equipment.  Real divers in this kind of equipment are crushed by water pressure when the air fails.  When they return to the surface too rapidly they die from decompression sickness, aka \\"the bends.\\"  Some Harry Potter magic might have been better.

B000V39KDO|5.0|And it only gets better.  This film takes us to a different time, place, and honor system.  Great warriors march off to battle an army 300 times the size of their's.  They know they will all likely die, but fight like wild animals nonethess.<br /><br />This film reminds us of what honor, committment, and country before self are all about.  And we can all learn in a society that seems to give little attention to that which once made Greece the center of the universe.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|Aslan has two major purposes in Zealot. One is to present an historical picture the conflicts in the Holy Land at the beginning of the First Century CE. The second is to use the historical perspective and the gospels to tease out the historical figure of Jesus of Nazareth.<br /><br />I thought he did an excellent job with the first purpose. Aslan makes the period come to life. The conflict between the Jews and the Roman overlords is well described as is the ambiguous role of the high priest and other wealthy Jews. I didn't realize that during the period there were numerous messiahs wandering the land healing the sick, performing miracles and claiming to be the Son of God. According to Aslan, the title Son of God referred to a ruler rather than the actual son of God. The people were so distressed under the rule of Rome that they were looking for someone to wrest their homeland from the grasp of the overlords.<br /><br />The second purpose, to find the historical Jesus by searching the available documents, was less satisfactory. Aslan seems to have made a decision in the beginning that the gospels were primarily propaganda written to enhance the Jesus myth. In his analysis, he uses only the Synoptic Gospels and Q. He discarded John's Gospel feeling that it tracked Paul's view of Christ's teachings rather than the Jewish version. For the Jewish version, he relies on James' letter believing that Jesus' brother would have a clearer idea of what he stood for than the other gospel writers who hadn't known him.<br /><br />I found the book very readable and would recommend it to anyone wanting to understand the political climate in the Holy Land before the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. However, I would recommend taking Aslan's pronouncement about the historical Jesus with a grain of salt. Jesus is presented in a variety of ways in the gospels. Aslan's portray of a rabble rouser who had designs on becoming King of the Jews is one way to read the gospels and does make sense in light of the political situation, but it is only one interpretation. I recommend additional reading about the time and some of the scholarly work on the gospels before embracing Aslan's interpretation wholeheartedly.<br /><br />I reviewed this book for Net Galley.se in light of the political situation, but it is only one interpretation. I recommend additional reading about the time and some of the scholarly work on the gospels before embracing Aslan's interpretation wholeheartedly.<br /><br />I reviewed this book for Net Galley.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|At forty-something years old, the narrator of this book returns home and begins to remember his childhood. Once a quiet and introverted boy, his imagination pieces together what happened in his past, and not all of his memories are positive ones.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's writing style takes on the viewpoint of a seven year old boy in a believable and engaging way that makes you feel as if you are him. All of the characters in here were realistic and memorable. This is great book for those who enjoy reading about everyday life from a child's perspective, with a magically woven veil over their eyes.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book changed my life.  This is not a book about the latest fad diet.  This is a book that describes why Americans are chronically sick and how we can change our lifestyle to be chronically healthy. I wish I would not have waited this long to read it.
