B0064MPXFA|4.0|Decided to watch because I had a free hour, and I ended up really liking this. Some of the writing is a bit cliche but for the most part the dialog is good, the cases are interesting ,and the ongoing storyline about the characters keeps me wanting to see what they do next.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I saw the Hobbit last year in an IMAX theater but enjoyed seeing it again on the small screen.  Very entertaining
B001XV09UG|4.0|A creepy and somewhat disturbing film. Cruise does his usual outstanding job, playing the naive physician who gets in too deep in an underground sex club, only to find that his wife is a secret member. They do a nice job of building suspense and intrigue, using the Christmas Holiday as a backdrop. It works pretty well.
B007FIY3VW|2.0|Nice icon induced me to buy but not as good as Office Pro.  Sorry I purchased.  Inside the app the icons for navigation and using looked were small and less professional looking.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|It has the perfect cast, great songs - it reminded me of the John Hughes movie genre - I would highly recommend!
B008XKSW7M|3.0|It is a great mindless movie that makes you laugh.  Story lines are easy to follow.  Do not recommend it of you are look for tips on pregnancy.  :)
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Megan wants a baby, but not the hassle a husband. Connor wants the perfect family without the complications of love. They meet in Vegas and after a night of heavy drinking, they wake up married. Connor is over joyed, Megan doesn't remember it. Connor has to convince Megan that staying married is best for both of them. He suggests a three month trial and Megan reluctantly accepts with one stipulation....NO SEX. Connor agrees but accepts the \\"no sex rule\\" as a challenge. Will Megan be able to fend off Connor's sexual advances? Does she really want to? Can they both get what they want?
B00AE5R2NO|5.0|A fun addition to Gups A,B,C,D and X. Teaches empathy and compassion for creatures great and small through adventures and drawing parallels between the sea world and the human world. Encourages critical thinking re that which makes every living thing unique.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I know this book got a lot of great reviews, but I was still hesitant because I've read a lot of books lately that we're sub-par that received rave reviews.......boy am I glad I decided to give this a go anyway.  I LOVED it....I rarely give 5 stars to anything, but it was so entertaining that I can't help myself.  I can't believe how many times I laughed out loud.  Drew Evans, the main character,  was so real to life in his asides that I got better advice from him than any self help book about men. What a fabulous heroine too.  The only thing that could've made it better would have been if there was an epilogue from her point of view.  Since the title says &#34;series&#34; I look forward to more.  Well done.  Definitely a perfect read for the summer.
B006885FZI|3.0|A comment that I've heard by my friends that have seen/own it. It's not a fair comparison I suppose. But taken on it's own merits, it is still &#34;ok&#34;. One of the problems is when a detailed book is condensed down and more added to the story line. Based on the book by Eugene Sledge's &#34;With the old breed&#34;. I highly recommend reading his book.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I gave it four stars bc it was good, not great.  I didn't want to put it down. I am sad that it is the last one of the series, though.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|I don't like how you cant buy potions with in game currency. But that's about the only thing i don't like. Its an amazing game over all. Never tried the online multiplayer though.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I had just finished reading Bill O'Reilly's &#34;Killing Lincoln&#34;  and this just fleshed out my knowledge of the era. 1wordasrequired. Duh.
B004LWZW4M|3.0|Not that great....entertaining but doesnt even rank with the originals...if their going to re-write the story at least<br />make it a good movie...and quite throwing the drama love story garbage in....it didnt help this movie at all...
B008Y78GYI|5.0|I  think Streisand's first time was her best time on film . She was never better on film than in Funny Girl.  The blu ray of the film is very well done. It looks like film and sounds great. A great film with an excellent presentation.
B00406O7YK|5.0|Gave a five star to the picture's dancing and huge sets and casts.  Could not afford to do that today.  However, did not think much of Streisand but that is because I do not like her.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|First one of his books I have read.  I wanted to find out if his books were crazy like the TV show Castle.  Pleasantly surprised.  Book was very good.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I completed the first two books as books on tape and was hooked.  This is a continuation of a great series.
0670827592|5.0|I ordered this book for my kids and it is absolutely adorable. It's written from the point of view of the wolf and how everything was just an unfortunate misunderstanding. A great book to add to your library.
B005LAII8A|2.0|In the future bodies cannot be disposed of without trace, so the mob syndicates send the victims into the past to be murdered and disposed of by \\"loopers.\\"  There is a thirty year gap between the future and the movie's present (which is itself 2044 A.D.).  A Mr. Big, nicknamed the Rain Man, is \\"closing the loop\\" on the loopers, which means their future selves are being sent back to the same loopers for execution and disposal.  Why?  We're never told.  Is the mysterious Rain Man afraid someone will find him out?  We don't know.<br /><br />As a time travel movie it shares the same problems as other such films.  Your head will spin, or as one of the characters says, thinking about it will fry your brain like an egg.  I was never quite sure at one point if the movie's characters (mainly  Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Bruce Willis as differently-aged but the same man) were caught in an endless loop or if there was a real ending to their actions.  It was hard to follow.  Consider this a spoiler if you wish, but it's more an example of the movie's confusion: Old man Joe (Willis) is returned twice to be executed.  Once he escapes his fate, and once he doesn't.  We tried out different scenarios as to what the latter attempt meant, with no luck.  The show, as far we could tell, doesn't make use of it or explain it.<br /><br />So much for the puzzles and paradoxes of time travel.  The movie turns into a more orthodox shoot-em-up action movie towards the end, and it's unbelievable the amount of damage protagonists can do in this type of show.  The young Joe makes a decision near the end that beggars belief, as he takes a stand with a family against his older self.<br /><br />Perhaps a second viewing would help clarify the movie, but I won't take the time again to do it.  Decently acted, murky, formulaic once you're past the time travel business, and a bit unbelievable that the main character does what he does, the movie was a disappointment.  While not a hard R, the movie earns itsR rating.
B00406O7YK|3.0|The film looks fantastic. The movie itself is just fair. An old fashion musical that was old fashion when it was released. Streisand's singing is great but she seems to be playing Mae West.
B005O7PXNS|5.0|This was the darker season of Castle where secrets were kept, leading to shipper joy. It is a must have for Castle fans.
B00AHHODH2|1.0|This book is poorly written and SO contrived. At first I thought the style was a joke somehow, but it never improved. I realize it was meant to be humorous or satirical, but it was just stupid. The plot and dialogue were sillier than the worst soap opera you could imagine. Don't waste your time or money on this one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Thus was very highly rated, but I know 2 people who stopped reading after the first two chapters.  Do not do that--keep reading. This gets better and better and is full of surprises.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A story of love waiting to be found and of two lives waiting to be lived. The bond between these two siblings exists even when they don't know one another.
B002QNBRXS|4.0|It is bizarre to actually be rooting for a bad guy, but we get so caught up in the plot that is what we do!
B007JM4CWY|3.0|Love the game its kind challenging , don't like the permissions,  larger puzzles are hard to do on my phone.
159562015X|3.0|Good book to start the process of discovering more about yourself. Once you find your strength it is worth spending some time investing in other resources to flush it out more fully. This book should start your process of self discovery.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i loved it it was fun and it wasted time so its worth it and its free so its awsome just like me
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I had this app on my phone and loved it. Was excited too see it come out for the kindle. The fact that it's free is even better! Really good graphics too, plus it teaches you about the ocean. Only complaint? I wish you could zoom out more. When your reef gets big, it's kind of a pain to harvest everything. Hence only 4 stars.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Have  really enjoyed this  - putting your reef together!  Quite entertaining - fun to see what others come  up with as well!  Pretty well done compared to other games and apps Ive used~
B00A8MGLAI|1.0|I watched this movie with five people. Two got up and left after 45 minutes. This movie is a waste of time if you are looking for entertainment. I recommend watching all of the extras first. Then the movie becomes more enjoyable. The acting is good to great. The filming.... great. The way the movie looks...great. The story....huh?
B007THA4FI|5.0|I really felt like I knew the characters and needed to know what happened to them. It was Thoroughly enjoyable
B004YW4L5K|5.0|This was definitely a good book. Sometimes hard to grasp the side stories, but knowledge of the subject or doing a little side digging to understand makes all the difference. Entertaining no the less.
B009GED3HS|5.0|One of the best seasons! I won't spoil anything but Barney's proposal and the finale both blew my mind!! Check it out.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Not having used many things like this, on kindle  or otherwise, I was surprised at how easy to use and organized it was.
B00847KFDS|2.0|How Rolling Stone gave this a five-star review is still a mystery to me. I'm so tired of hearing \\"Julie says this...Julie says that.\\" Can't he come up with an original idea himself? These were the first people that came to mind with all he's known over the decades. I like Bob Seger, but his voice is shot. I fear the words will come out his mouth....\\"It was Julie's idea to reform Creedence Clearwater Revival.\\" AHHHHHH!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Loved the first installment! So naturally, I had to read the next one! It was a little slower... At the halfway point it picked up and I didn't want to put it down!
B003B02O7I|5.0|This book was a great read and a wonderful story.  Started with a troubled Lawyer who needed to do something away from his past and was given the opportunity.  His assignment was to go to Brazil and find the woman named Rachel Lane.  She was the ilagitament daughter of a very wealthy man in the Us.  He has many children who were waiting for him to die because their last word from him indicated that he would be dividing the estate among the children and there were many.  But as soon as the will had been read to them before their Father's death, he tore it up and changed his will so that all money would go to the ilagitament daughter.  So, the lawyer whose job it was to find her went on quite a trip
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|But I guess that's what the Greeks meant by &#34;catharsis.&#34;  One of the great stories of all time, sadly predicated on perhaps the worst horror of all time, National Socialism.  Schindler  was an unusual character:  exposure to so much inhumanity and brutality made him more humane.  From a pretty cynical guy out to make a quick Reichsmark, he ended up giving his last pfennig to save his Jewish workers.  His saving grace was, I think, that he didn't go for dogma or accepted ideas, Nazi propaganda or otherwise (he was a nominal but indifferent Nazi and Catholic):  When he saw another human being, he just saw another human being not some cooked-up notion.  What is scary is that in a short period of totalitarian rule, so many monsters come out of the closet and, more scary, so many normal people are transformed into Believers...and monsters.  Then again, the Hope from the Ashes is exactly that very self-sacrificing decent people like Oskar Schindler likewise emerge from obscurity.  The ending, switching to color (I am old enough to remember at age 4 or so seeing the Wizard of Oz) and the survivors in 1993....was brilliant.  And immensely touching.
0307476073|4.0|From the start to the finish you are captured by the author's true encounters. Not only on the PCT but in her years and days before she adventures on her hike.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I love trying to solve puzzles and this is so fun. I used the hints  it was helpful but it still took me a while.  Would be downloading more games whenever I'm ready
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Simple fun. Like connect the dots with a twist.<br />I like a game that lets me use my mind without getting totally frustrated.<br />Love it!
B003XRELGQ|1.0|Bizarre satire. I kept reading hoping it would get better! I wasted my time trying something new. Boring. Won't be trying another book by this author for awhile!
B00CFOY244|5.0|As a mental health professional I thought I was getting into a movie about really bad side effects from Psych meds. What a surprise! I would recommended this movie to anyone interested in the human condition.
B002R88G4U|5.0|I love everything about this book...2 amazing female  leads....an assortment of fantastic, interesting and engaging extra characters.  You get a keen sense of life at that time in general and in Guernsey in particular.  It's beautifully told through the series of letters - which wouldn't have appealed to me at all before I read it - but it really works.  This book made me laugh, cry, cross, happy and very sad.  Really recommend it
B004UHL9EK|5.0|Having multiple preset timers is an excellent time saver. I have one for various workouts, naps, and work breaks. I would highly recommend this app for everyone.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|My son really wanted this game. It kind of sucks that they want you to continue to buy things. He just gets so bummed out because he cannot buy the extra. Regret getting it some days because it causes to may debates,
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love this series by Kathy Reichs and this is another one of her great books. I would recommend it to anyone who likes the TV series &#34;Bones'.
B0095P31L6|5.0|There are no fairy beautiful animals on this movie, so make sure to explain to the little ones why they are so unique looking.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book is just like the movie.  It also is very cool and the book teaches you a lesson. Everybody should love this book!!!!
0316044695|4.0|Some areas discribing the training went into too much detail and were too drawn out but otherwise it is a greart account of the dedication these men have.  They are ALL heros. Every one of them!<br />What these men went through is more incredible than any fiction writter can create. My thanks to Mr. Luttrell for taking the time to share it with us.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I saw COlleen on a.m. show talking about the book so I said I would give it a try.  It was wonderful. I laughed, cried.  To me I could not but it down. I am reading the second one now.  Thanks for a good read.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Such an adorable movie! It had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what the minions would do next! They were so funny, and added so much to the movie.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|Can't stop watching! Didn't watch during regular season as I heard it was very graphic and gruesome. However after recommendations from friends I decided to use Amazon On Demand through TiVo. Now when I download 3 episodes I frequently watch all 3 back to back. The acting is terrific and the plot twists keep me alert for what's going to happen next. I will positively get a TiVo Season Pass for the second season.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Excellent story line, acting, and great graphics.  3d makes all the difference without it being obtrusive....just adds depth and definition.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead has to be one of the best TV series I have ever watched! At first I was thinking \\"How exciting can a TV show about zombies? Every episode is going to be the same...just a bunch of zombie killing (don't get me wrong, it does have its fair share!)\\". Well AMC has done it again and has made the story about survival awesome!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I honestly cannot remember the last time I enjoyed a book this much! The writing was spot on - hilarious, sarcastic, heartwarming, honest, filled with angst, alpha-male, I could go on and on. Drew Evans will forever be one of my favorite characters. This book is unforgettable and if you like RL Matthewson \\"Playing for Keeps\\" you will love this. If you love this and haven't read that book, read it! The whole time you, as a reader, are basically just having a conversation with Drew. When you think one thing, he calls you on it. I just cannot say enough with how much I loved this. I cannot wait for more from the Tangled series and this author in general! Read it, you will not be disappointed.
B000V658EQ|4.0|Marvin Gaye's masterpiece is well worth listening to.  And his message so many years later is certainly worth hearing again and again.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Awesome series!! When is the next season going to be available to all? Eagerly awaiting for it to start!! Hope it's pretty soon!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|This calculator is terrific.  Very simple in design, but it works flawlessly and is really a great help<br />with woodworking and other instances where you deal with fractions.
1582701709|5.0|After reading so many of the recent reviews on the secret. I am astonished at the negativity expressed upon the nature of this book. I know this is a good book for anyone who needs a little boost and extra  technique in thinking positive.  Any human can use a new lesson in life from time to time. But to take the time to right your own \\" book\\" (review) on the many educated reasons why this book is trash,  is a laugh and a show of your own.  You smarty pant's share your big words on why this book is ridiculous... All the while you express the real facts and statements expressed in the book, which cannot be disputed. The secret is truthful, and can be helpful to anyone.  Your reviews are proof that NO book or DVD could ever help YOU.  If the negative reviewers are so knowledgable in self help.... Then how have you helped the people reading your reviews???  You have all clearly shown how negative you feel and that thinking positive or dreaming a dream and making it happen...doesn't happen in your worlds. Give it up, and choose happiness and you will find it!  It's called loving yourself and life  and accepting that we all need a little help once in a while... To the big goal and accomplishing it!  Whatever your goal is,  goals are worth having!  Nobody is too smart to learn something new!  And to the people who got this book as a gift, someone gave it to you for a reason!  With that said, your opinions and knowledge are always appreciated!
B003QSJDZQ|5.0|This movie is so funny, and fun!  A classic movie I could watch over and over without getting bored.  Love it!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Love this movie
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|This movie takes you from serious to hilarious in 60 seconds flat. Great story line, one of Arnolds best movies I have seen in a while.definitely worth buys to add to my collections
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This show was recommended by friends. We watched Season one and were hooked! Characters and storyline continue. I haven't read the books so I'm continually surprised --happily!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I thoroughly and completely enjoyed every moment of this game. I love challenges and games that make me think. This definitely fit the bill! PLEASE MAKE MORE!!
B00CE379IM|5.0|We had a little trouble understanding some of the southern dialect.  Interesting story.  It ended so there could be a sequel???

B00CKJTOHO|5.0|I watched all the seasons of Dexter, and this is probably the best one. I stopped watching dexter for a while, and kinda lost interest, but I'm glad I got back in to it, because this season was crazy!
B0035XVVDY|5.0|I opening movie about justice system!!!!  great Movie&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34;&#34; very good plot &#34;&#34;&#34; Fox and bulter were very good together!! good film!!
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Recommend to all.  Disappointed that the case was broken but found another one to use.  No damage to the DVD.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I found myself admiring the scenes, the locations and the attention to detail. The Story... well i could see where they where trying to go, but the wording and usage was just all wrong.  The characters where a bit over the top. But then again i can admire the fact that the film was even made... the performances where really quite good, even if their personalities where total fiction. I rented the movie for .99 cents so.... I have no complaints.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|I recently purchased a Schrade SCHF9 Knife for a friend's birthday gift and he loved it! The customer service at Sportsmanscreek.com was great & the knife has a lifetime warranty.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is one of the most thrilling books I have ever read. It has opened up a whole new avenue of reading for me. This is the 4th time I have read Fifty Shades of Grey. I can't get enough of Ana and Christian. I am so glad there are two more books in the series. What a love story with a kinky twist! Love this series. Read Fifty Shades of Grey, you will not be able to put it down.
B0081336FO|5.0|Just when I thought there were no new way to reintroduce Sherlock Holmes stories, I found this series.  I discovered this program through my Kindle on BBC America and was pleasantly surprised.  This is a very good adaptation with very good actors.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman make a convincing Holmes and Watson and I enjoyed how they were able to take the original stories and apply them to a modern  setting.<br /><br />Bravo!
B009CG29RK|5.0|Don't let the slapstick previews fool you, this is a heart-warming and sophisticated comedy that kids will love and adults will appreciate.  My 2 and 5 year-olds both love it, and my wife and I constantly quote it to each other.
1451695195|5.0|Convincing intimate sharing which gives any believer confirmation of hope and trust.<br />Should read, and be lifted in spirit towards truth.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|While there is so much to like about this film to like, and so much it brings to the genre, the story has some wholes and a couple copouts.<br /><br />The life and depth this film brings to the different species of middle earth is refreshing... I remember being excited to &#34;meat&#34; them. The action scenes where right on the mark. and the humor that is strewn throughout is delightful.<br /><br />Cons: I definitely felt a sense of dragging out of scenes, to fill in the time... One scene in particular was just unnecessary and completely absurd, it involves the Giants... I watched this movie, knowing it was a two part movie, and i hate those... I even deliberately did not see it in theaters, just because it was a two part movie, and the second part would not be out for another year. but they did end this first part, leaving you wanting more... but just the fact it's a two part movie leaves a sour taste.... But then again i did not seam to mind.<br /><br />Oh and the mother of all copouts returns... Eagles! god @#!$!@#$ eagles..... note for the director, if you have a way for your hero and his entire crew to avoid all torture and danger all while giving them the ability to cut their travel time to a couple hours don't let me know... i mean really... i don't want to sit through three hours of adventure, completely impressed with the action and story,  just to end up on a giant eagle that could have picked me up from my house, and flown me to my destination... it just undermines the legitimacy of the entire quest.... not to mention it makes the caricatures seem like complete idiots for not doing so in the first place. but anyways...<br /><br />I will be watching the second part as soon as it comes out... this time in theaters.
B005MLTGWK|5.0|After viewing State Of The Union,Brotherhood and Awake; I became a fan of Jason Issacs. I had to order this on a Region 2 format DVD from Amazon;but the reviews were excellent and after watching the six episodes I must agree. If your a Morse or Lewis fan then you will enjoy this. The haunting &#34;Mercy Now&#34; song by Mary Gautier is effective and it took a while to track it down but I did.
B001K3KK0Q|3.0|When I first saw this movie many, many years ago I really loved it.  A few weeks ago I reread the book and then saw the current movie with Leonardo DiCaprio.  There is no comparison.  DiCaprio captured the role of Gatsby with so much more class.  This version seemed to be so slow, however, Daisy was really very exciting and energetic, which added quite a bit to the film.  So, many years ago I would have given this film a higher rating, but now, having seen the 2013 version, my opinion was lowered quite a bit.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Movie is very good. Such a powerful story and they portray it so well.<br /><br />Russell Crowe actually does very well singing. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway do an incredible job.<br /><br />If you want to see an amazing story about the how grace can overcome all, watch this movie
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|This is such a lame mush crap, lots of yelling and not much substance. Then it just ends.  What a crappy follow up to the awesome first film
B002P79KAC|5.0|It's the Big Bang... with Jim Parsons as Sheldon, Johnny Galecki as Leonard, and Kaley Cuoco as Penny (with no last name?)... need I say more... If you watched the First Season, you are going to need the 2nd and the 3rd and so on... Awesome TV Show :)
B000FC1MCS|5.0|I saw the play in London (amazing staging and production) first, then read the book - both are very close with regard to script.  One of the best reads I've had lately!  It is so uniquely told through the voice of the narrator.  I've known peole like him and it was so true and so captivating.  One of the best!
B00127RAJY|2.0|I have Jillian's 6 week 6 pack and bought this one hoping that I would be able to add it to my workout rotation. It is fast-paced and gets your heart rate up quickly and I like that there is no wasted time. However, I could not stick with this one because I started having sharp pains in my knee from almost the beginning even though I was using proper form. I have no doubt that you could loose weight if you were able to stick with it. Too bad, because I really like Jillian's workout style.
B00006AW2L|5.0|Got this album basically for &#34;Paint it Black&#34; - one of my favorite songs - but have enjoyed all the other songs on it. It is a nice retro look at the Rolling Stone's beginning as rock icons. Especially appropriate to rock to on their 50th anniversary.
B009B1UZ7C|5.0|A very young fresh talent. I really enjoy his music.<br /><br />I really hope he goes far in the music world. All good luck to Jake Bugg!
B005PK57NU|5.0|Always fun to watch the many different elements spinning around the characters of this show.<br />Writing is very stylized and accessible.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My mother~in law recommended this game and I got hooked immediately. You just have to be careful about people scamming you out of your winnings.
1250012570|3.0|Look, I have a lot of mixed feelings about this book. I'm going to do things a little differently this time around, I think, in order to process my thoughts about Eleanor & Park. I will try my best for not spoilers.<br /><br />Things I liked about Eleanor & Park:<br />-All the fun, cultural references were great. The band names that bring back memories. The comic books (Watchmen! &lt;3).<br />-The way that Eleanor appears through Park's eyes. Confident (not hiding), cool (not weird), beautiful (not fat & ugly).<br />-The slow, timid buildup of feelings between Eleanor & Park.<br />-Pretty much everything about Park.<br />-The two girls that befriend Eleanor when everyone else is being a jerk to her.<br /><br />Things I didn't like about Eleanor & Park:<br />-Eleanor's entire, stupid family.<br />-The way Eleanor behaves toward Park half of the time. I truly did not understand her or her thought processes.<br />-The way that many problematic issues were handled (or not handled) not only by Eleanor, but by everyone else that was involved in them.<br />-The way Eleanor chose to handle things toward the end of the book.<br /><br />One of my favorite quotes:<br />\\"Maybe I'm not attracted to real girls, he'd thought at the time...<br /><br />Or maybe, he thought now, he just didn't recognize all those other girls. The way a computer drive will spit out a disk if it doesn't recognize the formatting.<br /><br />When he touched Eleanor's hand, he recognized her. He knew.\\"<br /><br />In conclusion<br />This book made me feel things, and it did make me cry at the end. But after the tears dried up, I was left feeling very conflicted about the whole thing. It took me a while to decide on the 3-star rating, because of this. I eventually settled on 3 stars because of the emotional factor. If I hadn't felt anything for them, or relished in any of those lovey-dovey scenes, it would have gotten 2 stars for sure. You might love this book, as many others do. It just wasn't the perfect romance for me.ance for me.
B003AWRMCE|4.0|I had seen part of the movie on TV so I needed to see the whole movie. A nice movie.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|This movie was highly recommended by good friends of mine but the climax wasn't very good and took a long time to get there.

B007XF4J66|4.0|(1/2) more - The title of the city fits but Rick's Cafe is hardly a place where one would find coffee-It's technically a cabaret/<br />nightclub. The cast is suburb & covers part of  the nationalities involved in the current war. Mr. Peter Lorre(Ugarte) initially hands the &#34;so-called&#34; transit papers taken from 2 Germans to a New Yorker of Dutch background Mr. Bogart (Rick Blaine). The next movie that<br />there together he's in possesion of 3 different European passports. More than a coincidence? Fourty-five minitues brings yu to<br />Ilsa & Ricks previous history in Paris. Happy to have this great movies in my personal collection.

B0095ZMMCK|5.0|It's nice to read that the characters can have flaws and limitations.  Also that the story line is very believable.
0143118706|5.0|I tried to keep my expectations in check after Eat Pray Love and this book really delivered. I love Gilbert's journalistic style. My daughter is working on her PhD in history researching the impact of marriage on women before the civil war. I handed down this book to her and she confirmed it's beautifully written and historically accurate. She was blown away - and a much harsher critic than me.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Synopsis:<br /><br />Jake Epping is a high school English teacher who takes on the challenge of teaching students at an adult education facility. While working through a batch of essays at the end of the day, he finds himself moved by one in particular. Compelled to discover more information, he speaks with the author of the paper and strikes up a friendship. Jake takes him to celebrate a milestone in a diner where the owner, Al, has a secret. As a last chance to set things right, Al lets Jake in on the secret portal in his diner that would take him back to a time before President Kennedy was assassinated. Jake becomes convinced of the portal's reality and devises a plan to change history, both close to home and abroad. Unfortunately, he has to bear the burden of those changes as well as the knowledge that no one must ever know about his journey.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />The story starts in the present day and yet slips back and forth through time with ease. The format was not difficult to follow, keeping the flow of the story unhindered. It was action-packed and kept me guessing from the moment Jake first went through the portal. One of the early plot twists that the author put into play has consequences far beyond what I would have imagined for the characters and the world itself. I found myself wanting to turn the page to find out what was going to happen more often than I wanted to put the book down. It was a great story from start to finish and one that I would recommend to lovers of Stephen King and those who have yet to discover him.
B00COGXGNQ|3.0|It was a love story without any big surprises,  The villian was really creepy and not very believable.  Just was not impressed.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I very much enjoyed the personalities of the Downton women.  They had class and really neat hats.  I am looking forward to the next chapter.
B00942Y6WI|5.0|What can I say?  Apparently, since reading and watching this, I have learned that both of my sets of Grandparents have had help before.  I thought it was a great movie and recommend everyone young and old seeing this.  Young, so they can have an idea of what it was like to be both black and white in the 50's and 60's.  Old because if you were white during the time period of this movie you can see what it was like for black maids to have to work for white families while dealing with their own problems at the same time.  If you have seen this and not read the book...READ IT!
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games' trilogy is the best trilogy I have EVER read. The story is one that, once finished, will provide you with a bitter/sweet sensation from no longer being able to explore the world of Panem. You will fall in love with each and every character, and feel like you know them personally, especially Katniss, Peeta and Gale. I recommend this book to all. I dare you to try to put any of the books down once you start and \\"May the odds be ever in your favor.\\"
B00COGXX7A|4.0|It was a pretty good movie. Houghs acting was a little meh at times but other than that cute movie.
B0076DELIG|3.0|I think Connelly is running out of steam with Hieronymus Bosch. The book was still enjoyable, but a bit tedious. Connelly is going the route of so many TV shows, where instead of continuing to give you great case after great case, they stray (too far!) into the personal lives and office politics of the characters.
B0095P29EG|4.0|A good superhero movie.  They did a good job with this movie and all the other movies leading up to The Avengers.

B001NLKWLW|3.0|I kept with this story but for me it dragged on. The characters were not ones that I found enjoyable. The story is interesting enough but much too dark.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|I chose this rating because I feel the movie outdoes the books.  Why?  The books have plot lines with massive holes in them and the Reacher of the books is less believable than Cruise in the movie.  I came to this in a skeptical mood and did not like Cruise as Reacher but since then I have read two more Reacher novels.  Each was good in action scenes but poor in plot and structure.<br /><br />Generally pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I will keep on reading Reacher books because there are few action thrillers as good as them out there.  I will continue to see poor plotting and good action scenes.  I read Sahara (in comparison) and it was horrible as a novel.  Sahara is another where the movie is better than the book.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|Pound for pound and dollar for dollar, this is a great camera bag.  I now have two of them.  If you were to go shopping retail for an equivalent bag, then you would be looking at $60+, maybe even $100.<br /><br />There are lots of previous reviews that give a lot of detail. For me, here it is:<br />-- Nice and deep.<br />-- Fairly broad size, and highly configurable<br />-- Lots of padding and straps<br />-- Inexpensive
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Really funny at times, well directed movie, but with Quentin Tarantinos blood everywhere look.<br />Great acting. Great movie<br />Must see
B001HN6922|5.0|Yes, this has been a very good purchase. The boys watch this movie at least twice a month since receiving it as a gift. They watch Cars (original), too.

B003U9W3GM|5.0|This is sort of the Pacific companion to the classic 'Forgotten Soldier'. It is a story of ghastly awfulness of ordinary men enmeshed in a pointless campaign. It encapsulates the Marines' weird war of stretches of protracted boredom interspersed by short periods of overwhelming blood soaked terror.  Like them or loath them, the Japanese soldiers were good, very good.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|I had high expectations for this film and I must say that it definately delivered! You take an amazing actor and pair it with an incredible storyline and you get \\"FLIGHT\\".  I give this movie double thumbs!

B00A8ECU24|3.0|great for little girls to play and good for kids 8 and under, just be aware that the game offers you to buy  more item's, the child can automatically order more item's. The app does not offer parental control that is easily found, also if there are parents that fear the social bug the game does offer an option to connect to social websites. It does have a &#34;buy over option&#34; but nothing permeate.

B00AOCLWF6|3.0|This show was not too bad..  The dialog was a little campy at times but overall it was ok.  The story line was not entirely unique, pretty much had the whole h.g. Wells The War of the Worlds thing going but the alien invaders were pretty unique.

B003TQKVGU|4.0|To me, this subject has always been something I've contemplated and theorized about, but never had any kind of grasp on. This book laid out some concrete ideology and examples that really put it all into perspective and solidified my beliefs on this subject matter. I give it 4 stars because there are so many references to religion and the Bible, and I'm just not really a religious person, so that aspect didn't interest me. Still, a wonderful read that I highly recommend!
B005PK553C|5.0|Its a story about the house and what happens in it.  I cant figure out why Moira is the only one who ages in the story.
B00APUQJLO|2.0|I usually lean towards movies that are provocative, avant-garde, left-of-center or dark.  This, however,  was just a complete waste of time and talent, and it disappointed me to see someone the caliber of Juliette Binoche take part in it.  I know the director and cast have stated there is a deeper meaning behind the film, but I have yet to discern what that meaning is.  A film from this particular book should have been right up my alley, but it missed the mark for me.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|So happy I decided to get this. I just wish there were more episodes in the first season. Hopefully they can keep putting out a great series.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I smiled, I laughed, I cried, and felt a great loss when I finished this book. A great book is certainly one that captures your heart and leaves an impression when it's finished. I think to really appreciate this book, you cannot focus so much on the characters but the perspective of life, of reality, of love, that was wonderfully written in a non-cliche way. My hat is off to John Green for this masterpiece. Insight and maturity are necessities to understand the deep message of this wonderfully breathtaking story.
B003TTMFCK|5.0|Grey's Anatomy is a great show. Start from the beginning to understand the plot more. I can never wait to watch each new episode. I'm a big fan of the series.
B00BT0ZS52|4.0|This movie was everything I expected it to be, but really weird in some ways that just bothered me. Some of the contrived language moments frankly made me wonder what they were thinking ala Jar Jar Banks. overall really beautiful, really entertaining and fun, just let me down in surprising ways. Still a solid movie and worth the watch.

0316017930|4.0|Never having read any of Gladwell's other books in school or otherwise, I was curious to see what all the fuss was about. I was not disappointed. The book is a quick read and each page is captivating with insights and information on the factors which lead to an individual being an &#34;outlier.&#34; The book reminded me a lot of Freakonomics, placing much of the emphasis on hidden factors leading to greatness and thinking outside the box.<br />The only reason I give it 4 out of 5 stars instead of 5/5 is because there is no takeaway, no practical information to live one's life with, which I usually look for in books, especially like this. But in terms of content, Gladwell has done us all a service.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Good characters that you care about immediately, love this historical Action / Drama series - they could go on for years with this, take it all the way through to Alfred the Great!

B00263HWM8|3.0|Only mildly entertaining.  The story line is pretty tired.  A real hero story would not be about a fool, but someone more rational in dealing with bad guys.
B0023SDPS6|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but found some of the scene changes to be confusing.  I found myself having to go back and re-read to see if I had missed something.  About a fourth of the way through the book I learned to just keep reading and the storyline would come together.  My biggest issue was I kept trying to put the actual show into this book, and the episode designed after this book was different.  When I let that go and just read the book for what it was, I truly enjoyed it.  It gets a 3 star simply because of the harsh scene changes, but all in all a good read.  I look forward to reading more of Craig Johnson's Longmire series.
B00338QENI|5.0|An awesome book!!!  A book for everyone.  Henrietta is the reason we do not have to worry about Polio in the USA, and many other diseases--yet so few have heard about her--read the book to find out why.  We all owe it to her to read this book.  Rebecca Skloot did a terrific job in telling this story--and deserves recognition for her outstanding job in the endeavor.  This book was recommended by a relative that is a physician--but you do not have to be in the medical field to be blown away by its startling, mind blowing information.
B007R41E8O|1.0|It would not download. I tried several times to get it to download and still nothing. I deleted the app and tried again with no luck.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book.  I've read it over and over.  I read it years ago before it became 50 shades when it was just fan fiction.  I was addicted then and still am.<br />You cant go wrong with these books!

B005LAIIKI|4.0|The comedy writer Julius Sharpe said on Twitter the other day that he just wanted to 'thank all the people who reviewed \\"Star Wars\\" on Netflix. You guys swayed me, I'll check it out.' He has a point, and it could save us all a whole lot of time. 'Django Unchained' is already a hugely popular movie, and so many, even among those who haven't seen it, are familiar by now with its fairly simple plot. So this time around, I'm only going to point out a few marked ways in which Quentin's seventh film struck me as rather unTarantinian.<br /><br />'Django', of course, is still very obviously a Tarantino film. But look, for instance, at how the flash-backs are done with quick fades rather than simple cuts, and how they're shot with different filters - 'flash-back' filters. This drains them of most of the immediacy of the flash-backs of his other movies. Or, more accurately, they make them actually feel like flash-backs; the equivalents in his other films were effectively just scene transitions. He also uses music rather flamboyantly this time, often using only small parts of songs, and he uses more of it than usual.<br /><br />The camera is also much more active than in previous films. Look at the often flashy way he films the lengthy scene at Candie's dinner table and compare it to the tavern scene in chapter four of 'Inglourious Basterds'. In that fifteen-minute scene, the camera is resolutely static throughout, using simple two-shots, three-shots and close-ups. For my money, this helped to make the scene quite considerably more immersive and suspenseful than the one at Candie's dinner table.<br /><br />Compare also the realism of the nazis and peripheral characters in 'Basterds' with the slave-owners and townsfolk in 'Django', who are consistently exaggerated and frequently played for laughs. For myself, I was a bit disappointed by this decline in realism. Now, I know Tarantino did this to retain much of the feel of the Spaghetti Westerns he's always loved so much. But oneof his greatest strengths has always been his talent for taking lesser genres and accentuating their best elements, while omitting their weaker ones. For most of his movies, this has included maintaining strict realism in the story's environments and supporting characters, but not so much in 'Django\\"s case.<br /><br />Because of its content, the story it tells and its central characters and performances, 'Django' is an excellent, classical tale of a film. It has a couple of plot twists that are stunning. I am told that the Samurai sword-fight sequence in 'Kill Bill Vol. 1' is probably the best ever filmed, and I have no doubt that 'Django\\"s revolver melee is as good a one as we're ever likely to see. But to an extent that surprised me, the movie lacks the definition of the rest of Quentin's films. I think there are three main reasons for this.<br /><br />First, the story is that of a journey, an adventure, and has a fairly set path its makers must follow. Tarantino's stories usually move wherever and whenever they want to, but in each place they visit, they tend strongly to sit firmly down and stay there a good while. 'Django' is more fluid and, except for Candyland, moves through its locales rather speedily.<br /><br />The second reason is that after 'Inglourious Basterds', his most restrained and static film yet, I believe Tarantino felt a need to have more fun making his next film, use more music, more comedy (I don't know how long it's been since I've laughed in a theatre as hard as I did when Quentin gets himself blown to smithereens), be more dynamic with his camera, and to finally fully indulge his love of Spaghetti Westerns, a desire which until now he's had to satisfy only in bits and pieces. This is all fine. But I think he set to work with less restraint than was strictly wise this time.<br /><br />The third reason is that his editor Sally Menke died a year or so before production began on the film. Sally had edited all of Quentin's films and had long been known as his greatest collaborator. I realize now that such a loss does have its effect on a film. And her replacement, though he was an assistant in the editing of the Kill Bill movies, may not have been an ideal choice.<br /><br />I point these things out because so few critics seem to have talked about them, and because together they work to produce a film with fewer marks of its director's craft and brilliance. Obviously 'Django Unchained' is a very strong and enjoyable film with numerous virtues, which delves fearlessly into a subject that's been so widely and wrongly ignored for so long that it now seems in real danger of being largely unknown to many of us. Consider the nauseating case of Arkansas Representative Jon Hubbard who, in a book published last year, wrote that 'The institution of slavery that the black race has long believed to be an abomination upon its people may actually have been a blessing in disguise', since the slaves would eventually be given full citizenship. So no harm done, I guess.<br /><br />Watching it, we can sense that this project was one of those dearest to its director's heart. Quentin spoke with bafflement about the unyielding reluctance of the film industry, and of society at large, to discuss or confront the terrors of thralldom. He said of his movie, 'Let this be the first stone through the window.'
B000H7J9QM|5.0|...but even better than the DVD! Love this movie and it sounds amazing on my surround sound system, the blu ray is crisp and clear and the music is great!!

B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best television productions I've come across in a very long time. I don't typically watch very much aside from FoodTV and/or HGTV because I don't care for most of what the networks produce and air. This show was recommended to me by a friend and I have been hooked ever since. Highly recommend.
1451673442|5.0|Wish I would have bought this a long time ago, but better late than never.<br />A must have for anyone.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I love this series, so it's an automatic 5 star...<br /><br />However....<br /><br />I sort of liked the stories better in the first series... these second sets of stories seem to be more &#34;stretched&#34;...granted, it's all fantasy to begin with, but it's not realistic anymore..the logics are getting twisted...some people's actions are not as credible as they once were...  And I do miss Sean Bean...
1936891026|5.0|I really enjoyed this book by Steven Pressfield.  I had heard about it from friends, colleagues, and thought leaders, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.  First and foremost, this is a screaming fast read.  It's not a novel, nor is it droll text book delivery...it is instead personal, deep, spiritual, and candid.  I found it entertaining and insightful.<br /><br />You don't have to agree with everything in the book to appreciate its wisdom.  Clearly Mr. Pressfield has the war wounds to warrant his perspective.  He knows resistance personally and what it takes to overcome.  As such, I recommend to anyone who has struggled to tap their creative genius, anyone who is wondering if their latest risk is just plain crazy, or anyone trying to create something new.<br /><br />Steven, thank you for such a bare series of revelations!
B004M8S440|5.0|I start by saying I am a fan of Georgette Heyer. I find her use of language a delight in itself. This is one of the better stories with a feisty heroine and an unsuitable  her. Vintage Heyer!
0307744434|5.0|This is very exciting and visually stimilating! I had a friend recommend this book, and I am glad they did. This is one of those books you read before bed, but instead of falling asleep you keep reading when you know you should be sleeping.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This album was everything that I wanted after their last release. The entire album flows beautifully and it feels like a true Alice in Chains album. It should be stated that Jerry deserves a lot of credit for making this album sound so complete, and William defiantly boosted his credit as a lead singer. Everything on this album is so tight that you may compress and stop breathing. I highly recommend this album to anyone who is still a grunge rock believer or AiC fans of \\"Jar of Flies\\" and \\"BGWTB\\". You can never replace Layne; but this album kicks so much ass you can't ignore it.
B009LMTDL0|3.0|Sheryl hit a lot of the high points of the book on her speaking tours, so I felt like the first few chapters were just repeats of what I had already heard.  She has some very good ideas about getting women to lean in and be more active leaders in the workplace, but overall I felt like it was hard to relate to her anecdotes.  She is clearly a brilliant woman that people are willing to make more accommodations for.<br /><br />Still - the first few chapters have some great advice for anyone that wants to get ahead in the workplace.
B009GESJH2|4.0|My first Kid Rock, has some catchy songs, showing he has moved away from his \\"rapper rock\\" days.  Nice stuff, but his shows are better.

B0012IWHDW|5.0|This has a lot of instrumental and acoustic songs, but the whole reason to get it is the killer version of \\"Knocking On Heaven's Door\\".
159514188X|4.0|I actually really loved this book. It was well written and I can see how some people say it is superficial, but high school is superficial. It is a good book though. One of my favorites and really shows how bullying can effect someone's lives.

B009NY43NY|1.0|After guiding her readers through twelve books, leading her readers down the path of two characters, Sookie and Eric, Harris decides to dump her plot line and end the whole series how she \\"always meant it to end.\\" Shotty work, Harris. She just dumped a storyline, perhaps poorly influenced by the Trueblood TV series, that ripped apart her books. I'm so disappointed that I will never buy another one of her books. Harris should not be trusted to deliver a series finale ever again.
0393320928|5.0|Richard Feynman was an incredible man - I only wish that I had had the opportunity to hear him in person. However, he writes in a conversational way - it feels as if he is speaking to me directly and only to me personally. His ideas are worth considering and he leaves us with a charge to better the world - for we humans are only starting - there are many thousands of years to go!!
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|Product good for children under three years old.  Perhaps it should be labeled accordingly.  If marketed correctly the game would be okay.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Any chance to get more/fresh Led Zeppelin that is not some rehashed bit is worth having.  Nice collection.  I actually like it better than \\"The Song Remains The Same\\".
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Such a great book! Such a great read! Exactly what I was looking for! BUT I recommend NEVER start reading a trilogy when they are not all released. I sit here sad and waiting for the third book to be available!
B0042J6VUS|1.0|This item broke so fast was not worth it and the shipping was so slow. Your better off buying it somewhere else or just holding it yourself.
B0036G94DY|5.0|this worked and fit perfect you add was right on thanks for the product and I will tell friends about your sight.
B005PK57IK|4.0|My wife and I got hooked on this series. The female characters are very strong. We are both waiting for the next season to be made available to prime viewers. You should definitely try this one out!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Terrible because this is the Head Start and not a complete game.  Should be marketed accordingly.  Like cigarettes and alcohol and drugs... it sucks you in for a disappointment.
B00B23O96A|5.0|This latest outing from Clapton is one of his best in recent years.  Nice work and a few collaberations.  Support the \\"Guitar God\\".
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I can't believe this game hasn't been around longer. After a bad  day I love to sit down and strategize about killing off as many people as I can. I know it sounds weird but you can learn so much from the different diseases.
B000I3W1XS|4.0|Haven't seen much old school star trek.  Decided to watch after seeing the 2013 movie.  Fun to see the parallels and borrowed ideas.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|I purchased this for my daughter who is 14 months old.  It is the perfect size for her to carry around.  She is not as attached to it as I expected her to be but I don't regret the purchase at all. The clothes on the baby doll are well made and she smells like vanilla.  Adorable doll!
B0037471SU|4.0|The twists and turns in this book are amazing...typical Harlan Coban.  Just when you think you have it all sorted...he throws in a bender.  One of my favourite authors.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Excellent product.  Takes too long to download but very good product.  Action good, plot good, webshooting well thought out.  Enjoyed.
B008U0FJF8|4.0|This is an interestingly jazzy work from Peter Gabriel's drummer.  Worth a listen, not great, but a good buy to listen to.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Haven't had it too long, but what I've seen I like so far.  Seems thorough and doesn't remove stuff that I don't want removed.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|While the storyline is somewhat familiar, it was done in a spectacular style that was colorful  and fast moving. On the moon Pandora, the earth military has invaded, seeking an element they find there. A young marine, crippled in an accident finds that the death of his brother has given him a pass to this strange planet to take part in a program his brother had been involved in prior to his death. The Avatar being he assumes has given him the ability to leave his wheelchair, but because he is on active duty, he finds himself embroiled in a plot to infiltrate the home of the people on this moon called the Na'avi, to learn about them in order to find their weaknesses because the element the company is seeking is directly under their encampment. On his first foray out he gets lost and is saved by Natira, who was intending to kill him until an omen stops her and she brings him to her people. he does learn and finds out what his own people are planning to do. It is then that he chooses sides although he finds himself frustrated until he finally realizes he must become a legendary being by conquering a creature known as Last Shadow and rallying the tribes and the entire moon to fight a terrible battle against his own people who are determined to kill them anyway they can.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is pretty legit for a free game gameplay is decent I'm not to far into it but it's a lot of fun and the graphics are great for a kindle game. Not sorry I downloaded this gem. Thanks for the free download!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I truly did enjoy this book and would recommend it. I took the books advice of sitting at the table and it has already worked wonders for me.
B00CW665VI|5.0|If I had to describe this book in one word it would be Hilarious... but one word is not enough so lets go with amusing, comical, convivial, entertaining, exhilarated, frolicsome, gay, gleeful, gut-busting, happy, humorous, jocular, jolly, jovial, joyful, joyous, laughable, lively, merry, mirthful, noisy, priceless, riot, rollicking, scream, side-splitting, uproarious and witty. Okay so I might have found those on the thesaurus page under hilarious but you get the point.<br /><br />\\"Riiiight. And when she finds out--and Alexandra will definitely find out, I assure you--she'll serve me my balls on a silver platter. With a nice garlic butter dipping sauce on the side and a good Chianti.\\"<br /><br />Seriously though, I think I have at least half of this book highlighted on my Kindle. Drew and his one liners? Amazing. Kate and her one liners? Amazing. I seriously want to become BFF's with these two and just sit back and watch them converse.<br /><br />\\"You are driving me crazy!\\"<br />Her cheeks are flushed, her breathing's fast, and she's got murder in her eyes. Beautiful. I raise my brows hopefully.<br />\\"Crazy? Like you want to rip my shirt open again?\\"<br />\\"No. Crazy like the itch of a yeast infection that just won't go away.\\"<br /><br />Drew's niece Mackenzie? The most incredible little girl ever! Between the swear jar (which I will admit, we had in my house at one time but I was becoming broke fast!) and her mouth (kids say the darndest things) I wanted to take her and raise her as mine own! Is that weird? Freaky? Okay fine, I'll be her God mother or something...<br /><br />I shake my head, and Kate says, \\"I see now why Alexandra started the Bad Word Jar, since you seem to spend so much time with Mackenzie.\\" \\"What do you mean?\\" She shrugs. \\"She talks like you. It's not every day you hear a four-year-old say Prince Charming is a douchebag who's only holding Cinderella back.\\" That's my girl. \\"Swearing is good for the soul.\\"<br /><br />Was the story a tad bit predictable? Yes. But, it was funny as hell and what female doesn't like hearing things through a males point of view? It was sexy, sweet, funny and they get their HEA! I Loved this book and recommend it to anyone that needs a laugh!
B001KEHAI0|5.0|One of my favorite movies.  I literally watch this movie over and over every Feb 2nd.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines:<br /><br />Phil: What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?<br /><br />Ralph: That about sums it up for me.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|I like this game BUT there is another bubble game that I like better better and and choose over this one.  It's just apples vs. oranges. This game is just fine but.....
B008BU75IQ|4.0|This is a continuation of an excellent 4-part story. Jeffrey Archer always writes a riveting story, often with great historical reference.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this app for the free app of the day, really just for the neck of it. Normally, I would never look twice at an app like this, as I am much more one for video gaming and books; however, I thought I would just give it a shot. I was expecting just a bunch of noises that were really just noises. But it contains melodies, binary tones , and, if you are into this sort of thing, a variety of noise. Whenever I used it, it completely blew me away. Now, don't get me wrong, there are quite a few sounds I will never touch, such as city noise , children at the playground, etc. but there are still plenty of sounds and melodies that are completely relaxing. As a matter of fact, if I turn on the Zen melody, I will not move for over half an hour just because of how much it soothes me. If you need to relax after a long day at work, or of you need to cool off after an argument, or if you just want to relax, this is the perfect app for you!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Very good 2nd album for them. Alot of variety as far as mood in this album. I feel this one is not as good as the first because it doesnt have as much a folk/story telling vibe as the first but still excellent and much better than a lot of music out now.
B004WR125O|5.0|If you have the Onkyo tuner, this is a must have accessory to get the full use of your new stereo. Once you have this, download the app for it, and remotely control your tuner from your smartphone and even send music to it.
B0064BCNA4|2.0|There were only a few notes, and they didn't seem to be in tune for what I was playing. Probably good for a kid, but an adult wants better than that
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|I was looking for a scary game I seen a ton of good reviews so I bought it for 99 cents  and to be honest it kinda sucks you just wander around and collect paper off trees while slender man appears around and you can't look at him or you die save your money to be honest
B008EKOIN8|5.0|This book is another great book by Michael Pollan...loved reading it.  Have already tried the pork butt recipe and braising beef shin...and hope some day to find the stone ground whole wheat sweet smell of flowers...many thanks
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is a fun game that can be enjoyed by all ages and with the new iron man suits in this game from the New movie is really cool
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is a show that keeps you interested. You become invested in the characters, their progression and their growth. You watch episdose after episode because you care about and want to know what happens to them each week. The court cases are interesting and the dynamics between the characters is excellent. Guest stars appear often and are welcome additions and not distractions as they are in some shows.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|This is a great fun series. It's a great crime drama that doesn't take itself so seriously that it's pretentious, but just enough to make you think.
B00B3EVNEE|2.0|I am a true RT fan.<br />This is not what I want to hear.<br />Covers done - overdone - and done not so good.<br />Robin - Find someone that inspires you to grow - not fade.
B005T87QCI|5.0|Great game works great on my kindle fire has never crashed once definitely worth 99 cents buy it now it's awesome
B0053TMP24|5.0|it was fantasmic and epic and awesome and cool and... well I think you get the point . it was a good book
B003MC5N28|5.0|I love this book in the beginning it was a little confusing other than that I love this book. Love
B00908DDZM|5.0|I truly enjoy this CD and cannot stop listening to it.  Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are true artists.  I ordered the Explicit version and also the Clean version so my kids could listen to it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved it! My first adult game purchase for my Kindle Fire HD. The story, the graphics, the hidden object scenes...worth the price plus!  I'm ready for part 2!
B006LSZECO|5.0|A good read until the end!! Definitely not what you expect to read, but then what would a good book be if you could guess the ending?
B0097K21YW|4.0|Good way to pass the time if you are bored. Not perfect but worth the price for it, it could have done well with better story.
B000MAK648|5.0|This film is a classic. I saw it as a kid when it came out, at a local theater and with the large screen, incredible audio, it was captivating. The cinematography is some of the best you will ever experience, the sound is overwhelming making you feel you are really present, and the acting is not stiff and unrealistic. James Garner actually drove his car , as did some others, which is quite fascinating. The work performed by the film crew at the many locations, showed their professionalism and attention for detail. The excitement, glamor and sheer and utter danger of racing those tiny cars during that period showed the audience everything they needed to know of the sport at that time.<br /><br />The sport of F1 has certainly changed over the years since this film was made, and while it is safer for everyone involved, the action is even more intense with the cars being much faster and quicker on the tracks. And, about the only track used in the film which is still mostly as it was in the 1960's is Monaco.<br /><br />It was certainly exciting seeing Richie Ginther, Graham Hill, Jim Clark, Phil Hill (no relation to Graham, who is Derek Hill's father, and Derek achieved what his dad did not: a World Driving Championship), Bruce McLaren, etc, in the film. In attesting to the dangers of the sport at that time, quite a few of the drivers seen in the film were killed within 5 or so years after this film was made. And, while many mfgrs. are still present (Lotus & Ferrari) today, so many teams folded due to the technology advancements made which were very costly. The sport today is not for the feint of heart nor the thin of the wallet, so to speak. Drivers make millions per year and are some of the best athletes in the world of sports due to their abilities to think quickly and sanely with heart rates of over 150 bpm at over 200 mph whilst enduring braking and cornering g-forces of over 5gs. If they crash into the safety barriers at 170mph, they survive the 9+gs of force. (I don't know how they avoid closed head injuries, though.)<br /><br />If you have a chance, you also need to see _Senna_, about the legendary & tragic McLaren driver, Ayrton Senna.<br /><br />Next up this year: _Rush_, by Ron Howard, on the Niki Lauda & James Hunt era. It could likely surpass _Grand Prix_ as the ultimate film of Formula One.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Simple to learn, but hard to master. Fun to upgrade vehicles, takes strategy and finese to reach REQUIRED DISTANCE. In top 3 favorite games on my kindle fire hd. Use the terrain to execute amazing stunts, which the game rewards you for. Menu, and UI (user interface), is elegant and stylish. This is  a must buy, satisfies any level of gamer. Well done, developers, can't wait for your next IP.
B005TQAI6G|1.0|I watched this on Netflix, and it was AWFUL! I have been a Britney fan in the past, but I don't think I want to fan over somebody who lip synchs, and can BARLEY even dance. She looked lazy, her facial expressions were awful, her speeches and screams were terrible, too. Garbage! DON'T BUY!
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Waited for the Kindle version to complete the series.  It is my opinion that the story could have been completed in 2 books.  The 3rd was the weakest of the trilogy.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I'm a little kid and I get bored with a lot of books but this book is  super good . I love the movie  .so I thought that it will be like it but it wasn't. It is so much better than the movie. If you like adventurers and witches this is the doom for you. P.S  this  Book is good for kids of all ages. . No foul language.
B005ES1D40|5.0|Excellent and confortable.  Color as expected and adequated for mens. Size was as indicated on the size table. I recommend it to everybody
0553579908|5.0|I'm only 1/3 through but holy s*** lemon chills this is a great book.    Can't recommend it enough to those who have read the first book!
B00CDTSFF8|4.0|Vikings: Season One is a well-crafted historically based series shown on the History Channel. I would consider the show one for adults as the story lines are rather dark and violent. You will see war scenes (in fact the first show started with a war scene); human sacrifice and some sex scenes.<br /><br />Historically, the show seems to be reasonably accurate when it comes to depicting costumes, shields and props. Some viewers have complained about using a Stavekirk Church for scenes depicting pagan rituals. A Stavekirck Church was built for Christian worship not pagan worship.<br /><br />Women are shown as being strong and independent and that's factual too as free women in Viking culture went war as shield maidens and fought along side their male counterparts. The character, Lagertha, for example is shown in battle when she joined her husband, Ragnar, during a Viking expedition to England.<br /><br />Of note:  It was interesting watching one of my distant relatives being depicted during the Vikings shows.<br /><br />Overall, the show is interesting and a painless way to get a feel for history. I just wish it was a bit more family friendly.<br /><br />Recommend with caveats given.
B000ID37RM|5.0|My sons and I listened to the unabridged audio version of the book as part of their home schooling. We watched the movie after that to give them a sense of what things looked like at the time. The boys were able to see where the movie was faithful to the book and where they made changes. They were delighted with the quality and didn't mind that it was black and white.
B00C1BUYX4|3.0|I am a big history buff and had high hopes for this movie. It was interesting and Day Lewis was great, but the movie was slow and boring.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I think hill climb racing is a awesome app and you could make it better like making a helicopter. Thank you
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I love dictionaries so I loved reading this really,really, really love d reading this dictionary so read this dictionary book.
B0087ITBPC|5.0|Great movie! Gave it to my mother for Mother's Day, and watched it with her and my son. We all laughed a lot!
B0036S4C6G|5.0|I'm just bowled over. I want to cry. Haven't read a book this good in years. So haunting, so comprehensive, so knowing. Egan gets right to the heart of the heart of the heart. Effortlessly. Dizzyingly. I feel drunk on her talent. God damn. Pulitzer indeed.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|I absolutely adore this album. The lyrics and music are beautifully written and performed, and these songs are some of the top-played ones in my iTunes.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|So far this is my favorite season.<br />In episode one the food tasting could have gone longer.  Everything is just wonderful in this season.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|If you are a U2 fan you must have this box set. The remastered record sounds amazing, and the quality of the box set is outstanding.<br />I must thank to the seller since the record was used like new, but on reality was almost new in outstanding conditions.<br />Also the delivery was very fast and accurate.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is such a beautiful love story with a sad. twist..I loved this book so much and can't wait to read the next one.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|This series isn't for the squeamish, but if you can get over the gory cg parts it is awesome. The gladiators do a fantastic job with the arena fights. This season focuses on Gannicus, who is a rock star in the arena. I hate blood and yuck and covered my eyes when I knew something gory was going to happen. After awhile you start to love and hate characters so much you don't notice. This is Ancient Rome at it's finest with all the gratuitous scenes you can handle. The story itself is interesting but it doesn't hurt that it is full of muscular sweaty gorgeous men.  Not for viewing anywhere near children. Language is a bit rough so don't need to have it where they can even hear it.
B005LAII80|4.0|I had low expectations for this movie.  Still had a bad taste in my mouth from Stallone's horrific take on Dredd.  But this movie is exactly like the comic book. Unabashed violence and simple plot...just like Dredd. Lean and mean.  What really makes this movie amazing is the fantastic female actresses that surround Dredd. Lena Headly is so badass as the bad guy.  Go watch and have fun!
B00AYHKIZ6|1.0|Bowie what the Heck is this? I just did not understand this cd at all. Sorry. I have listened to Bowie for all these decades too.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Amazing alarm clock!  Whoever created this rocks! thank you so much for this idea. Especially when your phone breaks and you need a back up.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|Fab album with some added info in leaflet. Great clear recordings of classic Hendrix. It's a real must for any Hendrix fan!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Excellent!  I know this is a 'young adult' book series, but they are well written and very good stories, so as an adult I read and enjoy anyway.  But alas! now I have to wait until October 2013 for the next book.  Rats!!! :-)
B005IQZB14|5.0|This is a great read.  I would recommend it for women in the 25-60 age group, or someone just out of college.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I really loved these books in the beginning. I am a huge reader and a sales associate at our local book store recommended them to me. Since i didn't like True Blood on HBO i thought not but she insisted so i relented. I loved the first one so much i was literally standing outside the book store the next morning waiting for it to open so i could buy the rest. I have read all of them and i was disappointed in the last one (12)but this one (13) was awful. I cant think of a single part of this book where i thought this is what i have been waiting for. I am sorry the series had to end this way. I had such better hopes for it....
B0050R0XEG|4.0|I lost two pieces of the toy part, and I have to order at lego.com to replace it! Luckily I got it!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its a lil slow if your older then 12 but I like it an so do my kids could use more help
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|I've read all of Lee Child's books with Jack Reacher as the main character. They have a little violence, but realatvely clean language. Only occasional expletive...Keep it up Lee...
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|I thought this would be a good match 3 type game, considering all the positive reviews I've read on the internet. How'd they all get it so wrong? This is not really a match 3 game and it's poorer for it. Uninstalled. I'll keep playing games like Puzzle Quest.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|It is a fun game with lots of action. It is really challenges. I am very happy I got it.
B00170F0WU|5.0|I love this movie because it's so touching. It does have a lot of violence, but then it is about a hit man.<br />I would recommend it to everyone
B00991TCOG|5.0|If you are a fan of Lindsey Stirling, I don't see any reason why you shouldn't pick up this CD.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|This movie was great. It can connect with younger girls that are struggling to be who they are when they're parents have different expectations from them. Her brothers made it so much funnier :)
B0094M2XE6|5.0|It would have been a great production! Music and staff were on point and did a wonderful job portraying Michaels vision.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I have not finished it yet, but so far it has kept my attention. The story is very appealing and down to earth, it also has a real life feel to it.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|More complex than kite runner and more moving<br />Again I await another book by this author.<br />This is that rare book, a page-turner with literary value.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|I've spent the time to look for the best, most cost effective player, and your're looking at.  Works great for kindle fuego homes!
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|This movie was pretty good. I wasn't sure about it because some cartoon movies can be boring. It was funny and cute, I would watch it again. They could have incorporated more games and I would have liked it more, but I'm sure some games didn't allow them to.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a good and exciting book and I suspect it will even make a good movie. However, it's not as exciting as the first book.
B00BU18U82|5.0|Love this game.  Lots of fun! I would recommend this to all people who farm or like to hunt. Great game.
B0016OLC5Q|4.0|Good road movie. Even Kristen Stewart doesn't compromise. Good job from Sean Penn directing, I wonder why this movie wasn't more successful
B000FGGE68|5.0|Stylish futuristic action movie! Good story line, and I love the costumes. Milla Jovovich is an amazing actress and she does a wonderful job playing the role of Violet in this unique and creative film. A must see!
B00APJLFEG|5.0|We really loved this movie. I wasn't sure about it because some cartoon movies can be boring. It was funny and cute, I would watch it again.
0066620996|5.0|A must read for all people interested in leading and growing a successful business. It is actually based on tons of research of highly successful companies, and not just some author's tips and suggestions.
1426308469|4.0|I bought this as a gift and I looked through it.  It is a great book.  Very informative and the pictures are great.
B001XVD2Z0|5.0|Often folks have pointed towards the action, visual and special effects of this film.  I also enjoyed those, but just thought I'd mention they are used with great craft to support the creation of this dystopian hero story of discovery and redemption worthy of Joseph Campbell.
B008ROG6E0|5.0|We all have one, this is mine.  Interesting premise of the future post-apocalypse.  A authoritative cop (sandman) comes to the light after tracking down dissidents (runners).
B002M5E2DW|1.0|Most of the reviews on this book either bash it or glorify it, so I'm going to try to give a more level headed review, giving due consideration to both sides. And yes I have read the book myself.<br /><br />The book in essence teaches you to improve your life through positive thinking, kindness to others, and maintaining clear visions of your goals in life. The author then adds a lot of outrageous supernatural mysticism to these practices, stating that my visualization and positive thoughts, you are actually radiating a psychic energy which affects matter and causes things to materialize. The mystic aspect of the book is what offends the opponents of the book. The author takes these supernatural ideas too far. The fan following of this book has become something very close to a mind controlling cult. These practices will definitely improve your life and that is why so many people swear by this book, but there is nothing supernatural about having clear goals in life. The mystical ideas promoted in the book make it a much more exciting read but also instill some unhealthy and irrational thought patterns like the reason why other people are afflicted with disease or hurt by natural disasters is because they weren't radiating enough positive energy, or that wealth and power will come to you just from thinking positively. The book has the ultimate escape clause: if the system doesn't seem to be working for you, it's because you aren't believing in it enough. Never trust a belief system that forbids you to question it. That breeds ignorance and closed-mindedness. Any psychologist can explain away all the supernatural claims in this book. For the fans of this book who are reading this, please don't take this personally. It honestly just scares me what this book does to people.<br /><br />If you want a self-help book that teaches you these same positive life practices, I strongly suggest 7 Habits of Highly Affective People. It teaches you all the same healthy life habits taught in The Secret, plus a whole lot more, and without all the crazy mysticism. Also it is much more instructional and goes into more precise detail on how to practice these habits. It's a wonderful book and it has truly helped me improve my life. For those of you searching for ways to improve your lives, I wish you the best in your journey.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This book is slow and challenging to get through. If you've already read the first two Hunger Games books, then go ahead and read this because it provides a lot of closure, but it doesn't have the same excitement and action that the other books offer.
B00821OX98|1.0|From the acting to the script nothing seemed engaging about the concept. It was as if we the audience were supposed to identify with the characters just because they showed up on the screen. It's a big miss for me.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Very engaging. I can hardly wait to see the next show. It's great to have whole seasons available so I can watch tandem episodes in a single day!
B0033AI4PM|5.0|A classic. Babs at her all-time best. There's nothing more to say. The Blu-ray restored release is awesome. Buy it.
0525953728|5.0|We should be thankful we have the Seals to protect our American way of life.  They are constantly risking their life for us.  No Easy Day gives an up-front view of what they do.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an exciting book that leads into an ok book series. If you only read The Hunger Games, then the story will feel complete to you. However, Collins' exciting writing style makes you crave the following books...only to be a little disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found it a very fun enjoyable game and I played it for ages till I lost  I find it a fun game on a rate or /10 I would give it 10/00
B00003CXRM|5.0|wonderful movie my family watches again and again. this last year my daughter had to do a report on this movie comparing it to the iliad and odyssey.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Fun action-paced thriller that actually has some really interesting stuff, including about how much the US relies on the dollar to be used internationally. Good when you learn something in a really fun book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read it in anticipation of the upcoming movie. I'm sure that the movie will be great, but I highly doubt that it will even be near as good as the book.
1451668945|5.0|I own every book Mary Higgins Clark has ever written.  She has a great style of writing that compares to no other.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|After seeing 'Train' on Rachael Ray every day for a week, I decided that I liked them, so I ordered their current CD. I was not disappointed. I listen to it as often as I can.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Not much to say except a quick way to connect to my email.  It works well and the only complaint I have is maybe something I just have not found yet but once in I cannot find how to sign off.  Strange but I saw the same thing on my Ipad.  I still use my laptop if I have the time.
B005DZMP00|4.0|This volume contains a lot of solo work off the &#34;Garcia&#34; and &#34;Ace&#34; LPs long before they were up to speed on playing them live
B006Y5H74W|5.0|Love it! Wasn't sure about it at first. I am going to have now rewatch it again and again. The cast and music are awesome!
B00CHILW64|4.0|It was very emotional and at the same time inspiring to fight for life. My heart goes out to all the people that suffered...
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Crappy version of The Untouchables. Maybe a good watch if you haven't seen a good gangster movie before. Waste of time.
B00006DEFA|5.0|Spectacular!  The music is the star.  We really enjoyed the additional disk which included the players revisiting their experiences while making the movie.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Well written. original story line, interesting characters that are fleshed out and the book is well paced. Hard to put down
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I found the gardens , houses , and all the various habitats, the cool bugs and the soldiers and battles  all very relaxing,just simple fun. I think tweens and younger would have great times  with this game.
B00B2G4O2G|2.0|The nation and, indeed, Western civilization, cannot afford Big Entertainment/mass media's trend towards ever more sadistic & morbid violence & desire to victimize, along with threads of anti-intellectualism, portraying study of Poe as possibly connecting loss of loves Lenore, Ulalie, etc. to brutal murder & maiming of maidens (except for the non-human criminal of the Rue Morgue).<br />SUCH AN EWIL SAGA!!
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Great CPU for the price ,has on board graphics hd 4000 so I can save for a good gpu thanks and the seller is 5 star
B005NPCJ88|5.0|I love this band and this album is no exception!  I was thinking to do a review on a song by song basis, but it has already been done.  let us just say if you like this band or are a fan of hard music, then its sure to be one of your favorites.  Three coworkers, who shall remain nameless, and also whom I affectionately refer to as the triplets (since they always agree on everything) turned me on to this band.<br /><br />It feels to me like reminiscent of slipknot, with some slight tool elements in there.  With this heavy hitting album, you just can't do wrong.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is wonderful. It is entertaining and always works. It is worth buying. Great for the kids to plau. I love it. Another good thing is it is free. Totally worth it. I would reccomend this app
B000ID1J40|5.0|We saw this movie when it came out - eons ago.  It was great then - it's still a great movie.  Some of the technology isn't quite as impressive to see NOW as it was when the movie came out but it withstands the test of time.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love one direction like a lot and I love this book this a great book I loved it :):):):);););)!!!!!!!!<3
B003JUGQ38|4.0|I have always been a Dr. Who fan. I love this series. 4 stars is about prefernce only. Not my favorite Doctor. Some prefer this one though.
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|THE MOVIES WERE WONDERFUL TO WATCH. LOVE TO WATCH JIM, SPOCK AND BONES TOGETHER.  THE MOVIES COME ALIVE WITH THEM.
006220629X|5.0|I love the writing and the twist and turns! It's a good fast read because you don't put it down.
B00BHMF578|1.0|The story is supposed to be true - but it isn't.  It didn't happen like the movie portrays.  WHich would be ok, if the exaggerated movie was more entertaining for it.  But the movie was choppy, boring...you never had any character development so you really didn't care whether or not the characters ever got out!  And the interesting part, where they were actually making their escape, took place in just a few minutes.  Not recommended....cannot understand how it won any awards.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Absolutely an amazing book, I can't wait to read the next book in the series. All in all, he has done another amazing book!
B0083SBMBM|2.0|I was really looking forward to seeing this film. It has a great cast. Truly. All the elements for a great sci fi~adventure movie are there. However, a third into the film I was.just so tired of jumping back and forth from actor to actor,character to charactor ,set to set I became lost. There was such a mixture of characters from the graphic novels(marvel comic books) .I am aware the title is THE AVENGERS , but we see short bursts of each and their powers fighting to save the world .It appeared to me as this movie lacked cohesion among the super heros and the task at hand. It is true that super heros always pull off their great feats just as everything seems lost. Someone seemed to forget to develop the characters through the film (unless we were expected to remember each from their previous exploits).<br />I know this was a big budget big grossing movie but I still was very disappointed .The production of this movie certainly wasnt meant for me. I like character development which did not take place or could not take place because of the number heros involved. So we are left with plot and special effects which were certainly there and ends there.

B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Not a great movie but not a bad movie.  Worth the price of renting - it has some good actions scenes.  Tom Cruise is always entertaining.
0062082353|5.0|Buy both books by Chris Kyle and support this American Hero's Family. Great material makes me proud to have served in the Navy for 25 years. 1975-2000 USN Submarine Force
B004G600A4|4.0|Saw Tangled with a friend and loved it! I bought my own copy, but the disk was scratched. But the movie is still great!
B0037VNX44|5.0|Not what I expected, which isn't bad. The actor is brilliant, and the character -- totally original. Brutal, and very real.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|This was a fascinating story, and the fact that it is a true story makes it that much more remarkable. The characters were very interesting, and the actors did a tremendous job bringing the characters to life.
B009KG7EMC|5.0|This is one of those rare times where the sequel is actually better than the original. All of the guys are back, plus a few more. And the scene with Chuck Norris alone is a reason to watch.
B006W0QR1S|5.0|Superb acting and a great story.  Not sure why I need to add more words, but here they are are.
B0045HCJ8U|4.0|Was good to watch. Brando's voice was like so not what I thought he would sound like. Guess too many Godfather movies.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Got hooked on this show from the very first episode. I started watching it by myself and got through about 5 episodes.  Afer a week of watching the show by myself my daughter sat down to watch the show with me, she loved the show so much I started over again from the first episode so that she could see it from the beginning.  Now both of us are hooked on this show.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I enjoyed it; it was long but ultimately worth the time. Intricate, well developed story line that requires the viewers undivided attention.
B000LC55F2|5.0|I saw this film in the theater and, when it was over, found myself standing to applaud. The best part was that I was not alone in this act. After hearing that several of my friends had not seen this I had to order it for a viewing get together. I highly recommend this movie. As with everything that Nolan has his hands on, it is very stylish and brings on feelings that you weren't aware could be brought on by a film. And WOW the twist and turns this one takes. Once you think you have it all figured out there is another huge twist and throws your world out of whack again. I can't praise this movie enough.
B00A9D0KNU|5.0|Steve Mcqueen is at his best in this movie and of course I can t forget Dustin Hoffman.  They don't make movies like this anymore.  Watch it or own it!
B00AEBB8YW|5.0|enjoyed the movie and the product was fine, just as it was advertised.  no problem with its arrival and and packaging

B004EBT5CU|4.0|this is my first cd by Adele. At first i wasn't sure I was going to like the entire album<br />but after a few weeks of playing it every time I was in the car, I really like it.This is a whole different gendre<br />for me so it took some getting use to. I'm a ountry music fan.
044654759X|4.0|This is the 4th book from Nicholas Sparks that I have read. Two of them I have enjoyed, while the other two were just meh. These four being Nights in Rodanthe, The Notebook, The Wedding, and the title being reviewed. This one I deeply enjoyed, and would venture to say is my favorite of the four. Safe Haven has a little something for everyone: mystery, romance, adventure, action....etc.<br />I have a very busy schedule, and while I make time everyday for reading it is usually only enough time for about 50 pages. On the first day I sat down to start this book, before I knew it I had flown through 150 pages and had to force myself to put it aside to start my studies. I'm recommending Safe Haven to all my friends in reading.
B00CWM3F4C|5.0|Love this album! Rock 'n' Roll is certainly alive and well. I wasn't a huge fan of the last one, but this is excellent. AIC is one of my favorite bands. They've never put out a bad album. This album just continues that legacy of quality rock 'n' roll music, which rocks hard and also offers a lot of introspection. We'll always miss Layne, but this is a great album. So glad you guys are still making music.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The show continues with good story lines- both the case each show and the continuing story thread of Alicia, Peter, Will and all of the other regular characters. Have to check in and see how they are doing each day!
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Lots of fun, great graphics, and a large variety of  things to do with the 6 different characters .  Both of my grandchildren love the game, and laugh while they make their different creations.
B001PB3RU8|3.0|This is taking me a little time to getr use to. I got the album after several of &#34;The Voice&#34;<br />contestants sang some of her songs. I'm still working on getting use to Florence's music.
B002ZG999U|4.0|I love all of these guys. I'm so happy to see them back and showing the young action guys how it's done.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Really awesome game. Nice graphics. Easy mode walks you through the game nicely. Challenging puzzles. You can't get very far at all though without purchasing the full version.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I decided to read this based on reviews from several book blogs on Facebook. It did not disappoint! I read this in one day. It was cute, romantic and oh so funny. The story had much detail that flowed nicely. I so enjoyed reading this!
B000U6BT40|5.0|Whimsical, futuristic, and very entertaining. Clean fun and adventurous with just the right amount of edge with mild violence and superb storywriting.
B007HO392S|3.0|This is a little too much scream at you music for me, even if I don like<br />some of Carrie's songs. Can't singers today sing to you without breaking your<br />eardrum's. I can still get the point of the song without all the screaming. Frank<br />Sinatra didn't always scream.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Took a few matches for me to get used to the may the matching works, but once I did I started having a blast.  The RPG elements are a great way to encourage repeated play.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great game with lots of fun challenges. many peoplenthink its cute; I just enjoy it for its great puzzles. Very addicting and amazing for being free.
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|Boring and long.  We didn't bother staying up to finish watching it.  Save your $$ and your time for something else.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This really kept me interested. I loved the different perspectives on the same subject. I was disappointed at the ending.
B00ALKPTFA|4.0|This book is presented in story form which I feel helps us to understand. It is simple and the message is clear. There is a step by step process for you to follow if you so choose.
B004TI5N38|3.0|While it was well written and an easy read, it was as predictable and far fetched, but still an entertaining time killer.
B00BB22GQM|5.0|Nice follow-up to their last album..let's see if it attracts the fickle minds of the twitter crowd.....do they really listen or just follow a trend?
0307352153|3.0|Susan Cain pleads her case too much, which is mine as well. But it won't matter at all in our culture, where the loudest mouth usually gets the most attention and reward.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|It was a really good family movie. Highly recommended and very fun to watch over and over with the family.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|I really loved the movie but I was thoroughly disappointed with Amazon Instant Video because it has no HDMI capability from its app. Hey, Amazon, you should buy one of your discounted calendars and notice it's 2013. I like streaming movies from my iPad to my TV in HDMI but your service doesn't support it. Hello? I'm done with you until you get with the program.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This series keeps you coming back to see what happens next. It is in the top 5 of my all time favorite shows. Love the humor, twists and turns, and character development.
B009A7E7SK|4.0|If your looking for a quick workout routine that really works your abs, this is what you want. It has everything set up for you w/ a complete schedule to work different areas.
B006GLLXXK|5.0|I love the books as well as the shows. Only half thru first season- nice change of pace from work and grad school. Very well acquainted with Sam trammels dad, Dr Trammel! :)
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A view of the events of WWII from the perspective of those who flew for their countries as warriors.  Motivated by national pride but more motivated by the passion to fly and respect for their enemies.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I'm not going to use Amazon Instant Video again until its app allows for HDMI capabilities through the iPad. It's a great movie and worth watching but don't expect to run it through your iPad. You rent the movie, you get ready to watch, then, you get the notice that the Amazon Instant Video app doesn't support HDMI. Why have an video app that doesn't support HDMI capabilities? What is the point? Wow. Pssst .... Amazon? It's 2013,
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I really enjoyed Silver Linings Playbook. It was a quick read & much better than the movie. I would recommend it.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love this game. play it all the time.  I have downloaded it to my phone and my kindle. I just hope it isn't too much of a distraction
B00987MQRQ|5.0|Spencer was taught this lesson by his father, a professor of anatomy.he and his brother accompanied their father in grave robbing, &#34;resurrecting&#34; to retrieve cadavers to further medical study.  His wife dead at the birth of his son, Spencer's father was agnostic.  But Spencer's grandfather warned of the damnation her would face for his activities.<br /><br />The author has done a master job of creating the mutation of the character itself.  Hudspeth's creation, however, considers &#34;awareness , is a symptom of our body.&#34;  This then is the story of a soul so twisted in life, he goes in search of proof that mutations are proof of a reverse evolution in which men have lost previous forms.  Spencer's obsessions make him a breathtaking specimen of literature.  The author's observations of often extremely cruel experiments is muted and understated as if to explain the progression of any science.  He reports the revulsion of those around him, but rarely makes a judgment.<br /><br />Added to this is the codex written by Spencer delineating the anatomy and function of several mythical creatures.  The author presents this as a body of work created by his own protagonist, Spencer.  The sheer volume of study and imagination is engrossing in entering this world.  This all seems like a strange little book, and it is.  But travel to another reality like this is a rare treat not to be missed.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|NCIS: Los Angeles is a show that is getting better with time. All characters flow together in complete harmony. Wouldn't change a thing. Finale is a huge cliff-hanger!!
0440236304|5.0|Burgett has written the most awesome series on WWII combat I've ever seen.  I've read 3 of his 4 books, and have the 4th on order.  If you're a WWII buff, this series is a must.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I chose this rating because it was vary detailed with what was going on in the book, I would recommend the book to my friends because they need to know how hard it is to be married to someone u met the night u marry them
B007FH9GA6|2.0|I thought with all the great reviews this would be a good movie. I knew what type of movie it was going to be going in to it but I was not happy with the turnout. I had trouble keeping interested in the movie. It was slow going and I have watched TV programs that were better.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Daniel Craig in my opinion is the best James Bond. Full of action and a twist at the end. Enjoy.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Last book of the Hunger games enjoyed all three. Would read again.  Hope next movie comes out soon. Can't wait.
B0096HL33G|3.0|I really enjoyed Rachel Weisz as always.  She is a wonderful actress.  The other actors were great also.  But this was a slow drab story with an ending that left all to the imagination, but very little was uplifting.  Not as washout but not very enjoyable.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|It is just like the first few movies so if you watched them and liked them chances are good you will like this show.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I'll never forget the first time I listened to Alice in Chains. The song was \\"Them Bones\\", one of their biggest and most recognizable hits. The eerie vocal harmonies in particular jumped out at me. The vicious groove and intensity just plowed me over and I knew I had to start digging into their albums. Once I bought Dirt, I was absolutely hooked. This band has carried me through some very rough times in my life. Whether it's the lighter acoustic songs or the heavy sludge metal numbers, I could always find a song I could latch onto and use as a catharsis.<br /><br />The album \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\" marked a new chapter for Alice in Chains after the untimely death of frontman Layne Staley. After a long period of rumors and mourning, the band continued on with a fantastic new vocalist/guitarist in Will DuVall and crafted a truly memorable comeback album. With a tinge of optimism and survival, the music was both fresh and familiar. Much to the surprise of even the most ardent Layne fans, the band's sound was just as deep, layered and emotional as it ever was. The guys had effectively re-established themselves in the modern rock landscape.<br /><br />Skip ahead four years. Much anticipation surrounded the latest Alice in Chains album, \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\". William had won over skeptical old school fans and the stage was set for Seattle's darlings of metal to rule once again. The singles \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Stone\\" took over radio stations and whetted the appetites of the band's hardcore followers including myself. With their bone-crushing riffs and velvety smooth harmonies, this pair of songs was a giant neon sign declaring something big was on the way.<br /><br />The sign did not lie.<br /><br />\\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is a hauntingly beautiful trip. Even though everyone in the band is in their mid-40's and are free from the addictions which plagued them early on, it's obvious demons are still present and they are all unleashed in this collection of music.From the scathing and bitterly sarcastic title track to the positively chilling \\"Hung on a Hook\\", to the manic anthem of paranoia and insanity \\"Voices\\", there isn't a feel-good song to be found. When William screams the line, \\"Not gonna save ya, perform euthanasia\\" accompanied by a nightmarish riff from Jerry Cantrell, it takes your breath away. Expect many lyrics like those and themes which continue to probe the darkest side of human nature.<br /><br />What's surprising, however, is the lack of metal songs. Despite being labeled as a grunge band in their earliest days, Alice in Chains has a bounty of music that gets you in the head banging, throwing-up-the-devil-horns mood. This album has a few moments like that, namely the aforementioned \\"Hollow\\", \\"Stone\\" and the epic 7 minute long \\"Phantom Limb\\". There's a lot more use of the acoustic guitar on display here and a general mid-paced doom and gloom mellowness. In this way, I'm very much reminded of their 1994 EP \\"Jar of Flies\\" and the self-titled final album with Staley. It may not make for great mainstream, radio-friendly material but hardcore fans will eat this up and ask for seconds. Most of the songs are over 5 minutes in length.<br /><br />I really need to bring up the production, as many people were upset by the loudness of \\"Black Gives Way To Blue\\". The way it<br />was mixed drowned out the dynamic elements of the songs. It was really difficult at times to pick out Mike Inez's stunning<br />bass riffs. The percussion wasn't as fleshed out as it should be, which is troubling considering the talent of Sean Kinney,<br />one of the band members who has been there since the birth of Alice in Chains in 1987. On this album, however, the loudness<br />is gone. Instead of everything blending together and wearing out your ears with extended listening, the production was<br />handled in a much smarter way. I don't know if the band worked with a different producer but there's a world of difference.<br />The only thing that irks me is how low Will's vocals are mixed in the chorus of \\"Hung on a Hook\\", but that's a small complaint.<br /><br />What else could I say about \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\"? It delivers exactly what hardcore fans crave. The band doesn't do anything too experimental here but at the same time it's a much different beast than their previous records. The vocals of Jerry and Will blend together in a gorgeously creepy and altogether unique way. The music is interesting with plenty of tempo changes. It has the winning combination of heavy metal and tender acoustic songs. The band is at the top of their game and there's not a single track I'd rather skip.<br /><br />Rest in peace to the departed band members, Layne Staley and Mike Starr. Wherever they are right now...they have got to be proud. Alice in Chains has created yet another masterpiece.<br /><br />5/5
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I didn't find this game to be intuitively organized nor well explained. I gave up after about 30 minutes of play.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|This first full EP by HTDA is a nice listen... I enjoy the ambient feel of many of the songs but generally I enjoy the songs where Trent is on backup more than just the one where his wife sings.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it is so awesome. it just needs spawners,wolves,cats,basically just like the PC vesion<br />amazon thankyou.p.s. needs redstone!
B001O7Y7ZC|4.0|Great older Phil (before the animated movie soundtracks).<br />Phil Collins is of course a classic artist that everyone should have in their library.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Im not good at writing book reviews but I will say this, I could not put this book down. The scene setting and storytelling are so detailed that I felt like I woke up in the silo and walked along side the characters. I love how the story unfolds like an elaborate piece of origami. If you are looking for a story you can really get lost in with characters you feel like you know then buy this book now. You won't be sorry.
B000002IKR|5.0|I really like Testament even though I usually listen to stuff like Eric Clapton and The Allman Brothers basicly any Southern Rock but there's that side of me that needs to hear some loud s*** like I love Metallica and lots of heavy others. But if you like it heavy then buy this CD !!!!
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Michael Giacchino returns to compose music for Star Trek Into Darkness(2013) and he did a really good job.<br />He wrote music for the 2009 reboot of Star Trek. Recycled music cues such as \\"Logo\\" and \\"Enterprising Young Men\\" sound fresh again. There's new music for the film such as a street chase through 23rd Century San Francisco. It sounds a little like the music from the second season Star Trek episode 'Amok Time'. The cover of the CD has artwork of the USS Enterprise sinking into Earth's atmosphere! This is an homage to the Star Trek episode 'The Naked Time'. There's footage of the USS Enterprise flying out of the ocean. This has got to be a reference to the 1966 German TV show Raumpatrouille Die Phantastichen Abenteur Des Raumschifess Orion/Space Patrol. The ending credits to Star Trek The Next Generation(1987-1994) look like Space Patrol's!<br />The late Peter Thomas composed the groovy Space Patrol music. Gene Roddenberry claimed that the Leslie Nielson sci-fi movie Forbidden Planet(1956) was one of his favorite movies. Giacchino wrote music for TV shows and video games. He composed music for movies such as Speed Racer(2008) and Ratatouille(2006). He likes to add silly names to music cues such as \\"Will It McFly\\" and \\"That New Car Smell\\". Giacchino's music score for Star Trek Into Darkness is good work. I will watch the movie as soon as I can.
B00005R2IS|5.0|Here is the original classic &#34;Mel Form Hell&#34; movie that all men need in their collection. Yes, it's a bit cheesy in places, but there is some first class killing as well. Great with or without a mullet and Fosters.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|You need to stay with the beginning threads to make sense of the end but it is really good IMO.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I liked this movie.<br />You have to pay attention to the dialog.<br />I watched it twice.<br />it works on a very interesting concept.<br />we are all somehow connected.
B000W00IAK|1.0|Even though I've been a long time fan of Steve Earle, this album was a big disappointment.  Couldn't even finish listening to it.
B00006JDVV|4.0|A fine Dragon Tale (without the talking animals).<br />Matthew M. shows up bald, tattoo laden, and all around bass a**. Plus we get a great performance by Christian Bale and Mr. Dragon (forgot his name). This is a guy movie which I strongly recommend with Beer, belching, chicken wings, and other various manly items.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|I love her voice. Pleasantly surprised with this CD.<br />Dido adds some hip-hop and rap and it plays well<br />I would recommend this CD if you enjoy upbeat music
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is AWESOME!!!I personally think it's #1 out of all of the games EVER!!!! You don't have to buy a character. You start with one, then you can buy more. There are mostly trains you have to dodge. You duck and jump. You collect coins while your running. You also collect power up's. You have 2x the coins while your running, Super bouncing shoes., and Jet packs. And best of all Suprise boxes. You get anything I love this game I think you would in the surprise box.  I like Subway Surfers and so will you.
B0091THRCU|4.0|This case is a nice alternative to the standard phone pouch.  I missed having a pouch similar to the one that I used for my BlackBerry many years ago so I searched high and low and opted for this one. Pros: sleek design, snug fit, great overall protection (as long as it's inside). Cons: some people may not enjoy having to pull on the tab to get their phone out, no protection once the phone is out of the case
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|5 chapters in and can't wait to turn each page. Been waiting forever for this book. So happy so far
B00BCJ1AXE|5.0|Heard their music on the radio. I love the whole album.<br />Funky beats and great lyrics. I would recommend this CD
B004SDEP38|3.0|I have to say that I'm not a big fan of office suites on the pc or mobile but this one isn't half bad. I use google docs for mobile so my files can be accessed from anywhere but this app has some features I've been waiting for in google docs mobile. I also enjoy that you can access all your google doc files from this app!
B0025WX2YW|5.0|One of the best shows ever. I love history and this show hit it right on the head. More shows need to be like this. Make me feel as though I am actually witnessing history.
B0007VZ91C|5.0|Would recomend this product. Easy to follow format. Gives both basics and advanced lessons, proper an slang version of vocabulary.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Love them. Early delivery.....and great for the kids to play together. Now just to get more games for them to keep playing.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game for the kids to play.  Addicting and they love the new versions of Temple Run, including the Disney Brave.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|One of the best shows ever. I love history and this show hit it right on the head. More shows need to be like this. Make me feel as though I am actually witnessing history.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm constantly amazed at all of the neat ideas that people come up with.  I've pinned many, many cool ideas for later review.
B00003CX9W|3.0|I watched the original Fantasia when I was a kid, and have to say that the reaction of most of my friends was \\"boy, are those big centaurs being nasty to that little one!\\" (and with all the colors involved, we didn't think \\"black vs white\\"). I think there's nothing more racist about the fancy, male-hungry centaurs treating their servant like dirt than there is in Aladdin when the guards (also drawn in an over the top way) wanting to chop off Aladdin's (or Jasmine's) hand for stealing a loaf of bread. Yes, it was racist, but it was reflecting existing racism. No matter what skin tone, people shouldn't treat people who are helping them like that, and it DOES show the bigger centaurs in a bad light. They deserve it. It's a darned pity they chose to mess up the music to try to protect themselves from the people who want to think that if they ever admit that the culture was racist, they are still tainted with it. People can learn, and we have. You can see racism, sexism and all sorts of shameful behavior shown in all \\"innocence\\" in most of the movies from the early 20th century- if you're looking for it. Live an learn and get on with it.
B004C3DLJ8|5.0|Few trilogies stand tall through all three movies, Toy Story is one of the few. Another solid showing from the writing to the animation.
B002R88G5E|5.0|Great story.  It was like you were there with the<br /> characters. Was memorized from start to finish. Would read again
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|It took me a few tries to get the hang of it. Then it was off to the Races! Hang in there and have fun!
1848321600|3.0|The book is well put together and has as my title indicates beautiful pictures. The books narrative needs a lot of work as details could be a lot better. Would I recommend this book for someone who loves beautiful sailing ship model pictures, its a definite plus, but for someone looking for history I recommend passing it up for something else.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|After using this app for a while I disabled the Adobe version so it would stop trying to update.  It works much better, quicker, and takes up less space.
B001JNND9W|4.0|I often hear about this movie as a 70s chase flick, or a Grindhouse movie with fast action. I was surprised at the depth of the main character told through flash-back memories throughout the Denver to San Francisco trek. This movie wouldn't be made today, there would be a lot more fancy camera work and I think the violence level would be way beyond what happens here. There was something about the early 70s that allowed for long shots with the camera where one could allow for your own opinions and thoughts to develop instead of having them force fed to you. There was a lot of interesting subtle references to a changing culture as the 60s were over and new modern Liberal world was unfolding. Not to say there is a good or bad motivation, just that &#34;the times they are a changing&#34;.<br /><br />Overall this isn't something I would revisit often but I love the overall feel of the movie. It is a chase film and has a gritty feel to it but there is something more, something that makes you connect and cheer for a reckless speed demon.
B0002TT0NM|5.0|have vhs tv needed tape  likelike like like  you are stupid you want a rating and you waste my time . I give you a brief rating that you wont except will never rate you again
B002PMPTIO|4.0|Love this movie I'm an original Series Trek fan and the cast is perfect to play the original members, story was great and I just watched the latest Into Darkness and it rocked very pleased with the movies JJ Abraham's is phenominal .
B00A3DZ61W|3.0|Great game play but I uninstalled it because it took up alot of space and the ads were even more intrusive than usual.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|Too many ads. And I only used it a few minutes. Kept my network busy, too. Sure it adds and subtracts, but why make me dismiss popular while I'm using it?
B003D0E3FM|5.0|A true classic!! It's interesting to look back at the early science fiction writers (mostly scientist)  and see what they envisioned for the future..concepts often realized! Equally impressive is the conceptualization by Hollywood...
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|The well of ascension has done more for my understanding of the characters and the world the mistaken saga is placed in heavily outweighing it's predecessor in that sense. This is the middle book and these things must be explained and don't get me wrong the action is still impeccable, if u fell for the first book like I did then this is a absolute must.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The forecasts are quite accurate and I get good use of the hourly forecasts in particular.  I would give it five stars if it didn't take up so much of my base memory.  My device is an HTC EVO and I've only got 512 of base memory with 32 Gig of micro-SD.  I sure wish I could load it onto the card...  Thinking of the old PC days when we had access to the \\"loadhigh\\" command to get around the \\"memory restriction\\".  I WILL upgrade my rating to FIVE stars if they ever compile the code well enough to make it smaller and at least let me transfer it to the microSD card.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is a fun mobile game I would recommend for anyone.  Some times the games do take a little bit longer so this is not for the person who is looking to play a game for just a minute or two.  Really fun game with tons of levels and extras, especially for a mobile game.  Fun and funny graphics and a strange, but interesting, concept (I mean Plants vs. Zombies, really? But somehow it works).
B007TTFXC0|5.0|This CD is very good. I love Amy MacDonald have have been listening to her music every day for the past 2 months. All the songs are great. There isn't one that I don't like. \\"Slow It Down\\" is my favorite.<br />Amazon AutoRip is great. You can start downloading and listening to the songs immediately and don't have to wait impatiently for it to arrive in the mail. If your house burns down and your CDs and computer are toast. You'll still have your music on Amazon Cloud Drive!!<br /><br />The 1 star review is for Amazon who sent me a used CD as brand new. I did not buy it from a reseller, only Amazon offers AutoRip, which I would not have had if not purchased directly from Amazon. The CD did not have the sticker that comes on top of all CDs and DVDs sealing it close. Freshly opened out of the shrink rap the jewel case was scratched up and had sticky smudges from sticker adhesive all over the back in places stickers aren't normally put on CDs, and the stickers that left the residue obviously weren't there. Opening up the case and pulling out the CD the data side had dirt and smudges on it, obviously handled before. This CD definitely was not in new condition but was sold as being new. Again, this was purchased directly from Amazon.com not private sellers through Amazon Marketplace.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|AMAZING!  Why didn't I get this as a gift years ago.  This could (would) have saved me from being an ignorant husband.  PLEASE read this before you get into troubled times!!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I works exactly as promised and I have found it to be a very handy tool.  I will make sure that this is one of the first apps that I install any time that I get a new device and I will recommend it to any one who asks.
B00846REIS|2.0|The story started out slow but got better towards the middle. I would recommend not giving up on it. The end of the story led me wanting more and wanting to find out what happens to then. The sexually parts of the were good. They got me hot and bothered at times.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like the game however it sometimes does not pamy out a win. It does work most of the time.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I am addicted within just two hours. I wish I didn't have to work so much. I'm loving it. can't wait to find more like it.
B004TI1WME|4.0|The application occupies a small foot print on my device(EVO) and provides great functionality.  I got it free and am very happy with it.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|Such a great game. It's better than Cats. I like to play it again, and again. I'm glad that it has multi player.
B003U80I5G|4.0|This is a good movie and is fairly true to the book, which has always been on of my favorites.
B00633W614|5.0|One of the best books I have read.  I love the Clifton Chronicles Series.  I highly recommend this series of books by Jeffrey Archer.
B00594XOZU|1.0|I hate apps like this, all it does is give kids a way to text and send pics without being monitored by their parents. Snap chat is the worst offender of this. Parents beware.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Terrible plot. Terrible acting. Terrible FACT-CHECKING which made it completely and entirely unbelievable. I mean, do a little research before you make a movie - you don't use shotgun shells in a rifle. If you're in the FROZEN ALASKAN WILDERNESS YOU WILL GET HYPOTHERMIA IF YOU FALL IN THE WATER LONG BEFORE A WOLF FINDS YOU. And wolves don't have human conscience/vengeance, etc. Just. Terrible.
B00005JLIU|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I have always really liked the performance of Carol Channing in this movie.
0979019710|5.0|I've been trying to wake up earlier for at least the past 3 months - but I'm one of the worst snoozers ever.  Some mornings I'll hit snooze 10 times... it's ridiculous.<br /><br />At first I wasn't sure if I should pick up Hal's book because I already knew the benefits of waking up early and I already knew I wanted to wake up earlier.  BUT like I said I had been really struggling actually doing it!<br /><br />But two days after finishing The Miracle Morning, I woke up right at 6am as planned and had a full 3 glorious hours to go through my routine before I left for work.  I went to bed at the same time as usual but used a ridiculously simple but very effective strategy in the book to make waking up much easier.<br /><br />The book dives in not only into how to wake up earlier but also gives a lot of suggestions on how to make the most of your time in the morning.<br /><br />If you want to wake up earlier but keep sleeping in, or maybe aren't sold on the idea of waking up early yet - either way I highly recommend this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Best book I've read in forever. Haunting sorrowful poignant. Sweet. My life will forever be touched by Leisel, Max, Rudy, Hans, Rosa and Isla. A must read!!!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I really like this app. its fun and challengingm the only thing is that I wish they didn't makenit al easy to flip over. but I like it overall.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|This is one of the best for the kids and the worst for me. They can not stop playing and I must end the fun for the day!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very accurate.  It is a great tool, especially for people who have trouble judging weather.It has yet to give me a false report.
B0036AWV6M|4.0|Good tunes, but not all great.  Definitely good enough to buy.  These 2 combined albums were very enjoyable.  Wouldn't play it every day, but still some great memories.
1118273052|4.0|I thought I'd go back and read the original Market Wizards book.  It still holds up 30 years later.  Interesting to see their predictions about the economic future back in the 80's, which mostly turned out to be wrong.  They obviously traded the markets rather than get hung up on macro views.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Great movie. This is a definite must have for collectors of Super Heroes. Excellent story. Can you find Stan Lee in the movie? I did!!!!!!!!!
B009IF8CH6|5.0|I look forward to seeing this show every week.  I even watch all the reruns.  keep up the good work
B006VFLIYK|5.0|While Baldacci is always a good read with lots of excitement, twists and turns, this is one of the best. The very end takes a big surprise turn and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Kill Bill and the pre-civil war South collide in this fitting Tarantino addition. I enjoyed it very much but thought some of the musical selections got in the way.
B001DRF84W|5.0|This movie rocked. Any lover of Super heroeas should have this in their collection. Hulk Smash!!! Hulk Smash!!! Yee Haw
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love this game it is so<br /> addicting! I haven't found anything wrong with it and hope it stays that way.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This was just one of those hauntingly good books, that leaves you feeling glad that you took the time to read it. Wonderful characters, really good writing, and best of all no smut :)
0345404475|3.0|Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, by Philip K. Dick, is a mixed bag of science fiction, action, romance, and mind-bending technologies and societal beliefs.  Overall, I would say that the ideas from the novel are decent and can be very fascinating at times, but the writing and plot details is frustrating.  The characters are also not all that likeable, so I didn't find myself rooting for them too often.<br /> Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep centers around the characters Rick Deckert and John Isadore, or J.R., who live on the post-nuclear war planet Earth.  A toxic dust slowly envelopes the world, making it less and less inhabitable.  Living animals are revered, so much so that android animals are manufactured.  After the war, most people emigrated to Mars, where there are now (slightly) more sophisticated colonies than on Earth.  Each house has their own android, and sometimes these androids escape to Earth, where they are hunted down and \\"retired\\" by Rick, a bounty hunter.  Rick must retire a new crew of androids, but the androids are highly sophisticated, most mentally and physically, and hunting them down isn't easy.  Rick begins to question his spiritual beliefs and his hatred for androids when he becomes entangled with one.<br /> J.R. is referred to as a \\"special,\\" meaning he was too damaged by the dust to even be able to emigrate to Mars.  He leads a lonely life until an android moves in to the vacant apartment below his.<br /> The book is split between these two, following their separate actions that eventually intertwine.<br /> There were a few things I liked about this book.  I enjoyed the way Philip K. Dick imagined the post-nuclear fallout society.  For example, I can imagine a world that has so little life on it that animals become revered.  Humans need something to give them hope, to believe in, so that idea seemed natural.  I also enjoyed the new religion, Mercerism, and the empathy boxes.  People would try to control their emotions in a world like this.  The dialogue is also well-written and believable, and helps move the plot along.<br /> There were things I really didn't like also.  The plot could be confusing at times, with things happening that really make no sense at all, like when Rick has a conversation with the leader of the new religion, Mercer.  There wasn't a lot of action, which you'd think there would be in a book about a guy that hunts down androids.  The book goes on and on at times describing how dangerous and hard to kill androids are, and then Rick kills them in one sentence.  I was hoping that's where the climax would come from, but, without giving away any spoilers, the main action of the story lasted about a paragraph.  It was frustrating.<br /> Another issue was the characters themselves.  Rick is a surly, cynical kind of guy, and I didn't find myself particularly caring about what happened to him.  The main android, Rachel Rosen, is a manipulative, apathetic character that did not make an interesting villain.  John Isadore was barely defined, and didn't even seem like a main character at all.<br /> Ultimately, this was a book that was bearable to read but didn't keep me reading all night.  I did like the science fiction elements to the story, but the characters were flat and uninteresting and the action was tepid.  I would have to give this book a C.  I didn't hate it, I didn't like it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game one of my favorites and its free couldn't get any better then that it fun to play and there are always new challenges you have to pass !!!!
1594744769|3.0|I loved the photos and the clever way the author intertwined the story into the pictures. I found this to be a very clever book. Unfortunately, about midway I lost total interest because it became sort of \\"Harry Potter-ish\\" and that isn't my genre. The story became too much like fantasy, and I am not a fantasy lover. But get it for the pics and the clever way the author writes.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|this game costs more than 99 cents. you get a few levels and then you have to pay more money. I urge you not to buy this game. dont give money to these rip off artists.
B002OMZTSU|4.0|If you like Craig Ferguson (and I do) you will find this book interesting and enjoyable. I liked it very much. Had fun looking up the people he talks about in it.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Highly recommend this to anyone starting a new journey in life. Great story with a great message about love and life and what you should truly be seeking.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I've always enjoyed Le Carre, but it has seemed that his powers were waning. But A Delicate Truth is more in the old tradition. It's certainly not in the top ten of his opus but neither is it in the bottom. It's more predictable than I would have liked and not as bittersweetly sad as many, but it's worth the effort.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|I have NO business background so when asked to formulate a business plan for a small start-up I needed some help.  This book is visual, simply and clearly laid out with easily accessible definitions and descriptions.
0790731509|5.0|It is a great movie and arrived to me in great shape just as the buyer said.  The actors in this movie did a good job.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I read some of the complaints on here and I'm not sure what people are talking about. I love this app!  I get to choose between a few of my favorite sounds, or combination of sounds they've provided or I've created, and I love that it shuts off after my designated amount of time.  I use a tablet, not a phone, so maybe I find it easier to use?  I just shut my tablet off and the sounds keep going until when I told it to.  I've actually tried to get to sleep without this and I miss it too much!  One of my fave apps.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|love the new vehicles. just going to take some time getting there, but should be worth the time it takes to get there
B009K916ZK|3.0|When this item came it was NOT new. It was Apple brand as specified, but had smudges and scratches on it, and was just in a plastic bag. The seller, BetaMac, should specify if they are offering a new or a used product. The adapter works fine, but I would rather have paid less for a used one or paid a few more dollars for a new one.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|We found this production superb, written and directed by folks who obviously have a thorough understanding of how life actually works.  There are many messages not noticed the first time, so watching again reveals gems missed and increases the clarity significantly.  You won't see a story like this coming from Hollywood, as its obviously anti-negative-polarity establishment.... but the hidden push is to wake people up and constantly strive further to free the human spirit from oppression despite the difficulties.<br /><br />Brilliant meaningful movie, one of the best we've seen in a long time...
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I can't wait for the next episode!  Each twist and turn drags me farther in to this wonderful story of Harry, Emma and Giles.
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|Expected better of Soderburgh, especially if this is his swan song. Pedantic but picked up in the 2nd half, but seemed predictable.
0452289963|5.0|If you can read from your heart and not your head, it feels as though it was written perfectly for you. There is so much growth that can be achieved from allowing this message to resonate. The funny thing is the first time I read it I had this odd sense like I knew all of it innately, but had forgotten from years of beliefs, conditioning, and distraction. Its a book that really brings you back to yourself quite simply. You should read it :)
B000O77QDI|4.0|These were great movies to choose from, and having a few hd dvd players around is<br />great considering these are going for very cheap.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|I love the game Epic because you can play every day,battle,and make stuff go away!<br /><br />On level 7-100 you will get more stuff and you can also connect with Facebook friends and visit their kingdom.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|The movie didn't miss a beat.  Its fun, action packed and no &#34;last kisses&#34; when the scene calls for action.  If you are not a Treker its ok.  Think of it as a new sci-fi series with a few throwback references you might not get.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Joining the Greek and Roman demi-gods was a good idea.  Reading Mark of Athena now and so far its terrific too. I recommend these three series to kids who are like the Harry Potter series fun and fantasy plus some history on Greek, Roman and Egyptian gods.  Rick Riordan has done his research on all o them and makes them entertaining Hard to put down.
B000MXPE88|4.0|These were great movies to choose from, and having a few hd dvd players around is<br />great considering these are going for very cheap.
B000FC0V3E|4.0|Very worth reading--  it had been YEARS!!!  Surprised at the strong anti-Semitism--  I hadn't remembered that about Hemingway.  Maybe he wrote that way to depict the era rather than his personal feelings--not sure<br /><br />In any event a very picturesque period piece--  Spain, bull fights and men (and one woman) who drink constantly and eat almost as often.<br /><br />Read it--  it's Hemingway.
B00511ONPG|5.0|Great info! Targeted, informative, hands-on approach to implementing a social media campaign for your business. Well done and thank you!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Learning about Jason and a new group of demi-gods.  Exciting!!  I think kids should read all of Rick' books.  The way he intertwines<br />These 9 kids lives with gods and their struggles to do what is right is amazing.
B000M5AJQ8|5.0|These were great movies to choose from, and having a few hd dvd players around is<br />great considering these are going for very cheap.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|First of all, I just want to say that I absolutely love this show.  However, I have only seen the 2005 and later seasons (not the old Doctor Who.)<br /><br />I can say with full confidence that the Pond's are my favorite companions.  I absolutely love them to death.  Matt Smith has also started to grow on me, though he's still my least favorite Doctor.<br /><br />As for this season- it was AWESOME!<br />Started off great with the two parter about the Silence, and everything that followed was great- except for the glaring plot holes in the finale.  I seriously don't understand why Moffat kept making such a huge deal about how the Doctor's death was a fixed point in time, and then just completely ignores what he has been telling us all season by having a &#34;replacement&#34; Doctor show up and get killed.  Not to mention the fact that this &#34;replacement&#34; Doctor tried to regenerate!  How in the heck does a robot fake regeneration?<br />The other thing that bothered me about the finale- why did the Doctor and River Song have to get married?  This was absolutely unnecessary and the whole ending seemed like a huge copout to an otherwise wonderful season.<br />It was also very unclear as to why the Silence wanted the Doctor dead so badly- there was a brief explanation that it was because the Doctor was time up of a war lord to that part of the galaxy- but even that was unclear.<br />Anyways.  Only one star docked for the above the reasons.<br />A must watch.  Can't wait until season 7 is free.
B005FISC52|5.0|This was a great series on TV for 9 seasons and I am just blessed by the every day situations that take place in Tree Hill
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Kids would have to play 24/7 to get enough coins to purchase anything. Game was designed to take parents money, not to entertain child. Skip download it would be cheaper to buy a real pet!
B000GFLEBI|4.0|These were great movies to choose from, and having a few hd dvd players around is<br />great considering these are going for very cheap.
B000000OTU|5.0|Love this album! Its a best of album that just doesn't get old. If you're looking for all of their hits in one place, this album is required.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|Those who remember dashing home from school to catch up on the latest happenings in Collinsport (oh what we would have given for a VCR!) have probably told others about this marvelously quirky show.  From time to time it has resurfaced on cable, experienced a short lived reboot but somehow just never seemed to catch on the way some other classic shows have.  This remake with big name stars offered so much promise, and happily delivered an interesting product.  It is not completely faithful to the original, but then what remake is?  It does capture lots of the quirky charm of the original if not the delightful feelings of terror, (there is never any doubt that Barnabas will triumph in this one) and many of the familiar characters and plot lines return.<br /><br />For those unfamiliar with the story the Collins family traveled to America from Liverpool in the 19th century to establish a fishing business in the colonies.  The family heir, Barnabas was cursed by a powerful witch, Angelique, when he scorned her for the beautiful Josette.  Barnabas, now a vampire, was imprisoned by the townspeople for 200 years when he was accidentally released in 1972.  Now Barnabas had to adapt to a greatly changed world and perhaps find a way to regain his humanity.<br /><br />Burton has managed to recapture some of the innocent fun of the original series, the all powerful vampire confronting his first automobile for example, and also to poke fun at the campiness of the original, the Collins are broke but they can afford to hire a live in psychiatrist, who happens to be a drunk and just a bit nuts and a governess, but don't check her references.<br /><br />Depp gives a wonderful performance as Barnabas, changing from an arrogant young man to a bewildered victim to the selfless lover with charming sensitivity reminiscent of Jonathan Frid's original portrayal.  Helena Bonham Carter's Dr Hoffman is delightfully campy although more sympathetic than the original is a delight.<br /><br />Theopen ending, suggesting of perhaps more to come, is in keeping with the cliffhangers that kept viewers anxiously awaiting the next installment all those years ago.
B009FZFONO|5.0|It pulls you in and is very entertaining. It certainly is worth renting the series and getting caught up on all 3. Well done!
B000GTJT16|4.0|These were great movies to choose from, and having a few hd dvd players around is<br />great considering these are going for very cheap.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I like what it does for my tablet. It is easy. It's free. Why not not try it for the simplicity.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Absolutely incredible movie. Super intense. The way that captured this miraculous and heart wrenching story is incredible. Not that any of us want to experience a tsunami, but you can certainly empathize with the victims in a whole new way after this movie.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|My twin tweens watching this flick about 15 times in allocated 48 hour rental period. Or so it felt. Every time I looked up at the living room, this was spinning on the TV. Heck, even I watched it - and I am north of 45. And got a few chuckles myself as well. Thinking movie this is not. It is not meant to be. Why 4 starts?  Keeps the tweens from destroying the house as well as, conveniently, makes them stationary for the duration. I can see how this flick can be alluring for 11 to 16 yo crowd.  Past that?  Not so much. And then there are Dire Straits......aaahhh...to be in the good ol' 80's again.
B000XNZ7LG|5.0|These were great movies to choose from, and having a few hd dvd players around is<br />great considering these are going for very cheap.
B009AMAGXK|3.0|I should begin by saying that I have not, as of yet, not read these books. And I'm glad that I haven't. Although I will!<br /><br />I was expecting so much more out of this movie. I think the hype around the books, and also there was a few impressive cast members (Jeremy Irons, Emma Thompson are two I have highly respected- & if it wasn't for them, I would've probably stopped the player mid-movie)<br />The movie is loosely based off of &#34;casters&#34; or witches, who have unique powers, and apparently the females can turn good or bad at age 16. Of course our heroine is 15 & falls for a local townie boy. Which, being from the south, AGAIN the most awful attempt at southern drawl in this movie. Emma & Jeremy do a good impersonation- being from England I was surprised at how well they did- but the rest of the cast needs to be flogged. The guy himself, no offense, seems like a huge dork. In one scene the heroine is in a magical library & it shows him, I swear to God, eating a banana with a huge sheepish grin on his face. Again, no offense to the actor, but I was expecting much more handsome actors. Even the heroine could have used more makeup. The local townie girls were very VERY pretty, Emma looked great, the aunts & grandmothers looked great. Why are our star crossed lovers looking like they rolled out of bed? They look frumpy & tired. Maybe this is how they are supposed to look in the book. I mean, that was Bella's deal in Twilight. Average. Nothing beautiful until she was turned. But I'm getting distracted. You'll e see what I mean.<br /><br />So overall, it's an OK movie. I wouldn't spend the $15 at Walmart again to buy the BluRay, I'd wait for it to hit HBO & watch it then.<br />Emma & Jeremy, as expected, make the movie to me. They are both so talented & I was beyond excited to see them together. I can't remember her real name, but the lady who acts like a surrogate mom, the Liberian keeper, is also a really good actress. The rest of cast is ok. The guy playing the hero was terrible. Bad attempts at southern language & southern humor & southern terminology. Normal girl meets boy, is somehow going to harm the boy if they stay together, tries to get rid of boy love story. Though the filming itself is beautiful & rich. It DID remind me of the south... Lots of trees, old homes, old families with deep roots & even deeper secrets. The colors are beautiful.<br />I think my fave scene is when everyone is sitting down for dinner & it becomes the mad hatter tea party ride. That was funny.<br />Like I said, just wait for it to come out on TV. Your not missing much.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The Kindle Manual said that there was a light near the power switch that should be on while the unit is recharging but I could find no such light so I called tech support. I was told that light no longer exists and that I could tell my Kindle was recharging by watching the wave on the battery icon--but my icon rested with no wave. So I was sent a USB Cable and lo and behold there was now a wave in the icon and my kindle recharged in half the time. How could I have gone on without it?

B004WR125O|1.0|I have a Onkyo TX-8050 receiver and this Wireless LAN Adapter works but has some issues as you've read  SO  instead of all the problems of setting this up and dealing with signal strengths why not just buy a CAT-5 cable and run it from your router to your receiver. That took under 1 minute with NO issues at all and the cable was cheaper than this unit. Not that there's anything wrong with this unit but why deal with the headaches UNLESS you have to?<br /><br />i.e. Keep It Simple

B008Y7N7JW|5.0|THOUGHT THIS WAS one of the best movies in a while. I had to watch it twice. Would like more movies like it!
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|I liked it but I didn't love it like I expected to. It was hard to get a grasp on Jennifer Lawrence's character, which made me sad because I love her. Bradley Cooper was impeccable. I loved the scenes between him and his family. I know I'm in the minority here, so if you've been thinking about renting this, go ahead and do it. You'll probably love it.

B003JTHWPA|5.0|Even if you have difficulty enjoying this slow-paced novel, where not a whole lot happens, you have to admit that it has a great title. The title is key to understanding the novel's themes: loneliness, a hunt for friendship, a hunt for truth, and a look at what people carry in their hearts. This is yet another adult novel often required for teenagers to read in high school. While my adult self found the novel absorbing and thought-provoking, I can imagine my teenage self may have been bored. The vision of life McCullers paints is very sad, rarely happy, as the reader follows a year in the lives of five characters, and yet you get a sense that we all face the same problems and concerns the characters in the novel face, to some degree.<br /><br />The back cover of the novel says Mick Kelly, a young girl, is the main character, but I'm not sure the novel truly does center on any one character. There is also Biff Brannon, who owns a barely successful bar; Doctor Copeland, a black doctor who wants to elevate his race above the problems of the day; Jake Blount, a drunkard obsessed with the ideology of Karl Marx; and Peter Singer, a deaf mute whose best friend was just transported off to a mental care facility. The novel takes place towards the end of the Great Depression, just as Hitler is beginning to lead the world into World War II, and it seems this depression has taken a toll on the people not only financially, but emotionally. Of the five characters listed above, only two seem somewhat happy: Mick because she's young, and Singer because he's always happy to have company.<br /><br />There are times when the novel does drag on, and other times when you wonder why McCullers decided to include pages upon pages of Blount and Copeland ranting. There are also plenty of moments of quiet reflection, and moments of beauty. Mostly, we feel the novel's harsh, stark reality. It doesn't seem quite like the kind of life most of us lead. The world McCullers creates feels much more depressing than the life that I know - then again, everyone's lives are deeply personal and there are no doubt plenty who see life in the same stark terms as the characters in the novel. What does feel universal is the desire to be heard, to be understood, and the feeling that very few people do understand us. It is the reason I write these reviews - to talk about my thoughts, to share them with others, and to make sense about the books that I read. In today's world of social media, that is why we like posts and retweet messages, to show our appreciation and understanding of what others say. And in the future this will be true as well, but in a different form. Whether or not her characters seem more or less sad than the people you may know, it's impossible to deny that McCullers's themes are universal for all people in all times.depressing than the life that I know - then again, everyone's lives are deeply personal and there are no doubt plenty who see life in the same stark terms as the characters in the novel.

1401201911|5.0|Once upon a time there was an infant named Kal-El from the distant planet Krypton. When the planet's red sun was going out, Krypton was on the verge of destruction. In order to save at least one member of their race, Kal-El's parents place him in a little spaceship and send the ship to Earth while everyone else dies with KryptoKal-El would eventually become Superman, the Man of Steel. And where on Earth does his ship land, not on a small farm in Kansas, but in the heart of communist Russia!<br /><br />If you think that I'm making this up, I am not. In this parallel universe, Superman now fights for the soviets, the expansion of communism, and Joseph Stalin. Eventually after Stalin's death, Superman takes control of the Soviet Union and soon America is the only noncommunist country left on Earth.<br /><br />An entirely original Superman Storyline by Mark Millar, the writer of THE ULTIMATES, SUPERMAN: RED SON is filled with lots of action and meaningful moments! The best Superman storyline ever since THE DEATH OF SUPERMAN!

B0095VPBFY|4.0|I bought one of these from a competitor, only realizing Amazon sold this apu for less. Too late now.<br /><br />To the point, I use this apu in a cheap htpc for light uses like youtube, watching daily show, and screwing around on Ubuntu without worrying about losing anything important when I screw up in the command line. It seems to work fine for all this so far.<br /><br />It's great for those on a budget. With this, I can piece together a decent computer with hd capabilities and add better components as I can afford them and want them. I'm planning on eventually throwing in a better cpu cooler and a graphics processor card, but I don't feel rushed into buying them in order to have a functional hi-def htpc.<br /><br />edit: After using this for couple weeks, I still think it's awesome for the price. If you are using it for Ubuntu, I'd recommend one of the lighter flavors like lubuntu, xubuntu, or gnome fallback. I originally started out with normal Ubuntu 12.04, and while the cpu did not struggle at all, I prefer my computers to be more lean and efficient rather than simply looking nice. I changed to gnome fallback without effects, and it just sips the processor power. It went from 6-8% when just running teh os without any open apps to about 2-5% after making this switch. I also tried lubuntu and xubuntu. They work well too. Xubuntu is my second choice.

B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I'm someone who likes all things Trek, from the original series (and even the animated version with the original cast and writers) up to and including the &#34;Enterprise&#34; prequel series.  I liked the first reboot film and found this one good as well: Who can resist seeing Kirk trying to mediate a &#34;lovers' quarrel&#34; between Spock and Uhura in the middle of an action sequence?  Most impressively, it went the distance and made serious commentary on current events - which was relatively rare in the Trek series after TNG. &#34;Into Darkness&#34; bravely criticizes the decision to assassinate Osama Bin Laden rather than capture him and bring him to trial - and with the criticism coming from President Obama's onscreen doppelganger. It does so with fictionalized characters, but the point was clear: that's not who we want to be.  That's why sci-fi began to be taken seriously in the McCarthy era - it provided a forum to make social commentary by draping it in the guise of another time and place.  There is right-wing as well as left-wing sci-fi: while progressive sci-fi advocates going out to meet and try to understand new life forms and new civilizations, right-wing sci-fi preaches fear of even our friends and neighbors, who might have become &#34;pod people&#34; - in other words, &#34;commies.&#34;  The Borg initially appeared to be Trek yielding to the pod-people narrative, except that - like the Klingon Worf - eventually some members of the Borg, like Hugh and Seven of Nine, became allies, in the classic &#34;quest&#34; narrative where the hero's compassion - and determination to treat others fairly - turns honorable opponents into friends.  My only criticism of &#34;Into Darkness&#34; was its overuse of 3D gimmicry - do we really need to be barraged over and over again with debris flying off the screen into our faces? In fact, that trick is self-defeating since the stuff just disappears as it flies off the screen, with the net effect being to call our attention to the fakery - taking us out of the picture, rather than immersing us in it.  Now that I have it in 2D I can say unreservedly that it's a great film.

B00BQ1D7X4|4.0|First, I have to comment on someone else's comment about this being proof that the \\"grunge genre\\" having \\"long since faded into music history\\"... to that, all I can say is... you're just now realizing this?!?  \\"Grunge\\" died long long ago... even the musicians who pioneered that \\"genre\\" always hated the term.  Grunge is and always has been a ridiculous term for what is simply raw rock music.  So don't take anyone seriously who comments on this album as a status-check for the current state of \\"grunge music.\\"  The artists hate it, and most of us (who have long ago moved on) hate it as well.<br /><br />Ok, for the album... I agree with what another review here said, if you liked Black Gives Way To Blue, then you'll probably like this as well.  I think they're very similar, save a few exceptions that are stylistically different anything on BGWTB.  In particular, the song \\"Voices\\" stands out because they dialed back a bit on the heavy guitars and focused on a more raspy acoustic / electric combo.  It's an excellent song, might be my favorite initially.  I also noticed some different approaches on texture, with the songs like \\"Phantom Limb\\" having more arpeggi-like patterns, and \\"Hung On A Hook\\" taking a bit more of an ambient tone.  The vocals throughout the album are excellent in my opinion; any casual fan could listen and know this is AiC within seconds.  I consider myself to be very picky about sound quality, but I'm not hearing what would make some reviewers say the mastering was \\"awful\\"... yes, the dynamic range could be better... but I've noticed bands that use pro-tools (this is clearly a pro-tooled album) tend to not finish with a great deal of dynamic range... they clearly compressed the crap out of it during mastering, but the album delivers a LOT of punch and clarity where it really counts.<br /><br />In summary, for those of us who understand and accept that Layne Staley is dead, that AiC is going to KEEP MAKING MUSIC, and that grunge is a long-dead and irrelevant term... this is a very good record.  For those who are still stuck in the past and can't listen to something new without comparing it to something old, you might feel differently.  Buy it, don't buy it, whatever... anyone can go listen to it on Spotify at 320 kbps... but I personally consider it well worth adding to my collection.
B008EKOIN8|4.0|I enjoy the writing style of Michael Pollan. He uses a narrative style which is easy on my mind and eye while at the same time fills my head with information and much food for thought. Now I cannot say that I agree 100 percent with everything Pollan writes; good grief, I can actually say that about every non-fiction book I have ever read...come to think of it. But that being said, this work, like other books by this author, has caused me to think and has prompted me do to further research and the book has gone a long was in stimulating my love of cooking and eating...it has created more enthusiasm and made me more aware of what and why I put things into my body, how and why I either enjoy them or do not.<br /><br />Basically, Pollan has based his work around the four elements and how these elements touch, enhance and change the food that we eat. Fire, Water, Air and Earth. He further speculates how the use of these four basic elements, interacting with meat, vegetables and grain, have influenced and guided the evolution of man. The author is quick to point out that many of his \\"theories\\" are just that - i.e. theories. On the other hand he supplies the reader with strong reasons and has indeed done a tremendous amount of research on the subject.<br /><br />There were parts of this work that I very much liked such as how the four elements chance and enhance the flavor of what we eat. I enjoyed this abbreviated history of cooking which runs as a general theme throughout the book. I found all this information to be quite informative. I enjoyed his tales concerning his odyssey into the art of cooking and found it to be not only filled with bits of nice information but quite entertaining. I also found that one of his continual themes that cooking at home; cooking as a \\"family\\" has strong and binding social ramifications and how the lack of doing so over the past several decades has most certainly had an effect on our society - this aspect of Pollan's work I fully agreed with. I know in my personal case that my wife and I have been cooking and preparing meals together for 50 years now and to be quite frank - that has worked out quite well in our case.<br /><br />Now be aware that this is NOT a cookbook. You will not find recipes (Well, actually he gives us four of them at the back of the book - none of which I have any intention of trying). It is a book that examines the preparation of food at home verses the preparation of book by the food industry and what we have lost and gained over the years.<br /><br />There, for me, were down sides to this book. The primary two being that at times the author goes off on philosophical rants which is fine and dandy but I personally could have done without them. The second is that the author tends, from time to time, to be a bit overly \\"gushy\\" with his enthusiasm for my taste. These were minor problems - hey, it was his book and his song to sing. I tend to take the good with the bad and focus on the good in books such as this.<br /><br />Now there are negative reviews on this book and there is a particular long one which attacks the author's work with vigor. This, to my mind, is a good thing as we need to examine works such as this from all angles whether we agree or not. Recommend that the potential reader of this work read those/that review and make up their own mind.<br /><br />This is one of those books that you almost have to read on your own; some are going to like it, others will not. I personally fall into the camp of those that feel it was a very worthwhile read.<br /><br />Don Blankenship<br />The Ozarksith.

B000OLRH10|4.0|This is actually my second time watching this movie and I noticed a lot more subtleties this time around.  E.g. the Rhodesia =&#62; Zimbabwe banter.  Too bad it's true and we haven't stopped it.
B009AMANBA|3.0|This movie was LONG!  Mildly interesting.  Some good acting.  But LOOOOOOOOOONG!  I would not recommend it.  But I am glad I saw it, even tho I didn't care for it very much.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Funny, insightful. Fey takes us on an introspective journey through her life. From High School, to her improv days, through snl and up to the Palin/30 Rock madness. Very enjoyable read.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Lean In is an honest assessment of certain sectors of the business world as they are today for women. The thorough research with the personal anecdotes  combined provide compelling evidence for the truth of the book while making it a pleasure to read. I highly recommend the book to anyone with aspirations to succeed and/or lead in the next decade as society recognizes and reacts to the challenges that Sheryl Sandberg presents.
B000FA5SMK|5.0|I had read this book several years ago but since I wanted to read The Lion, The Lion's Game and The Panther, I thought I should read it again to get the start of the story.  I thought it was excellent.
B0099114WO|5.0|I love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones.  They were both so good in this movie.  If you haven't seen it yet, see it!  You'll be glad you did!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Game Of Throne is a well-written and compelling book filled with intrigue, suspense,secrecy, and adventure within a loosely knit league of great houses and the great barrier fortress that defends them from the malicious forces of the outside world... The Wall. I am almost done with the first book and looking forward to the next one. Mr. Martin has a way of keeping you transfixed  with each chapter. The characters are gritty, earthy, ... realistic, believable in how they relate to each other. The reader can identify with them in  their struggles, challenges,  victories.  I can hardly put this book down. To me this book is close to being my favorite after LOTR by J.R.R. Tolking but it is easier to read.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|Very fun. It is the only Android game I have kept  playing after the first few plays. I recommend it.

B004FP1WX0|5.0|I was really impressed by how well done this whole documentary was.  Knowing the basic premise was enough to make me think I knew how it was all going to go down.  Instead, what I got was a thoughtful, sensitive, intelligent, and funny documentary that focused on the people involved as people, rather than some sort of sinister or otherwise sensationalized theme.  Well done!
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Really could do without the blasphemy and constant F bombs. The story line is interesting but the language sometimes puts a real damper on it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Not sure whats going to happen,that's the way I like it. Entertaining.Enjoyable ,good story line,without unnecessary swearing. Will continue to watch.
B00847KFDS|5.0|This record is truly a testament to Fogerty's musical genius. I know many people cringe at the idea of artists re-recording their legendary songs, but this album shines all the way through. Fogerty was very mindful with his choice of artists and I think it is obvious that he made sure every track offered something fresh to his old hits. His two original songs, the bluesy romp \\"Train of Fools\\" and my new favorite Fogerty song, \\"Mystic Highway\\" leave me hungry and excited for his next batch of original songs. It might even be his best song to date!<br /><br />Key tracks: Fortunate Son (Dave Grohl is the man)<br />  Mystic Highway (A folk-rock anthem that rocks for over 6 minutes! One of his best originals to date)<br />  Wrote A Song For Everyone (A album cut off of \\"Green River\\" Lambert fits the song perfectly, Tom Morello shreds!)<br />  Someday Never Comes (Dawes is a great young folk-rock band from LA, great harmonies and a great rhythm section)<br />  Almost Saturday Night (Keith Urban on banjo and Fogerty on lead guitar, very catchy!)<br />  Long As I Can See the Light (This pairing really feels right, MMJ fans are in for a treat)<br /><br />Overall, an album that proves John Fogerty is still relevant and rockin' harder than ever. Listen to it from start to finish, you will not be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S. I would like a Volume 2 please!! (Black Keys collaboration anyone?)
B00992CF6W|5.0|Fun game. More fun when you connect with friends. If you don't, it gets a little boring. Good game though.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Gibbs is the man! Love the supporting actors/actresses and they don't miss a beat! Funny, action, and more. Been watching it for years now.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|for those looking for proof of something like heaven, this comes close. quick read, lots of interesting details. esp good following on anita moorjani
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It satisfied my need for some escapism in an easily managed format. I am enjoying my Kindle and all it allows me to connect all manner of fun.
B008GXHOFW|3.0|This game is one of my favorite games. But every single once in a while, itll erase every last bit of your progress. Its really annoying.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Into high intense, twisters and edge of your seat shows? This is for you. Yes it's zombies, but wow it's good.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|I love John Grisham....great story and a great author. Keep it up.<br />I would recommend any of his books.  Enjoy.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|There are moments in this book where, no matter how hard you try, you'll feel your lip quiver.<br />Max Brooks has a way of making you feel everything these characters are feeling. It's just perfect. Definitely a must read!
B003VANOFY|2.0|Unfortunately, I waited a few months to open these up and test them, so I can't return them now.<br /><br />I couldn't use the additional features included in the CD-Rom because I don't have a disk drive on my Apple computer, and the Logitech website did not appear to have any digital download. Also, there's nothing in the instructions telling the consumer to switch their \\"Audio-OUT\\" selection under Audio Preferences (though this would likely be obvious to some).<br /><br />Bottom line, however is that:<br />* The headphones themselves don't have high quality sound. It was mediocre at best.<br />* The mic sounded terrible when I tried to use it for Skype calls.<br />* These headphones can't be used on the TV or with Roku box.<br /><br />For the reasons given above, I certainly don't think they were worth the $150 that I paid for them. Maybe they're worth it if you're a gamer, and use only an X-Box, but I would not recommend.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Great story and plot and action. Really wish they'd leave out the constant F bombs. Would be much better without the language. Otherwise love it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't read much fiction, but I am a true Stephen King fan. Focused on interesting characters, this was a readable book that I enjoyed voraciously until the last page. Recommended.
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This product really changes the experience of using the ZX-1.  Now you can just turn on the camera and shoot.  The cap has a tight fit, and sound operation. Highly recommended.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Been using it as my exclusive alarm clock for over a year now.  Only problems I've had were due to phone issues,  not the app.
0525425772|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and that is why I rated this book as a 5. I will let everyone know about this book. Look forward from buy future books by John Grisham and purchasing from Amazon.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|I have never been disappointed with a movie made from Nick Sparks novels.  Initially this looked like a predictable plot, but it had enough turns to keep my attention to the end.  Julianne Hough did a great job.
B000002KIK|4.0|Hearing about how terrible this album was in advance, I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised to find there were a lot of interesting songs and good performances. No, it doesn't sound exactly like their earlier albums, there is more experimentation and other musical influences thrown into the heavy mix, including keyboards and even saxophone. Still, it's largely a pretty rocking album, marred only by a few bits of self-indulgence that don't always work. I find it amusing that so many people say this is their \\"worst\\" album ever. True, the two albums with Ronnie James Dio that followed this one were very good, but after that? All those albums Tony Iommi put out with his different singers and rotating musical lineups like \\"Tyr\\" and \\"Dehumanizer\\" are somehow better? Not in my opinion, although each to their own I guess. While this is not one of their all-time classic albums, I would still recommend it if you are someone who likes a little variety in your hard rock. It's a very good album that has at least 5 or 6 excellent songs and even some catchy melodies. If however, the thought of Sabbath playing anything other than in the sludge/doom style of their first few (admittedly great) albums turns you off, then skip this. It's not for you.
B00B19GKI0|5.0|Kurt Russell has a way with words. If I had to describe him in two words......... Bad Ass!<br /><br />Rent it!
B004D0YB4Y|5.0|I've been on to Charles Bradley for about 7-8 months..  When I heard \\"How Long\\" I KNEW I needed to buy this album.  I enjoy it so much I just bought a copy for my Dad.  I hope he enjoys it as well.<br /><br />He has a classic sound, extraordinary voice for a modern time.  Love it.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|I bought this item since I am going on a trip and wanted extra protection for my iphone.  It is going to be great for our summer vacations to protect my phone.  I like the weight of it and the color I got (pink and grey). I could not use this on a daily basis bc of the design.  Not sure about the clear cover, hard to get phone to scroll also it does not work well with my current docking station so I have to use wall charger.  Buttons are hard to press on side/top.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I loved the book.  Very well written.  Kept me intrigued.  Had a lot of &#34;quotable quotes&#34; and made me think.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie, really enjoyed the story and look forward to more. I've watched this more than once and am 60 years old.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|But a very pleasant surprise. What I assumed would be a social commentary - on Big Pharma and the medical profession's predisposition to prescribe medications that create bigger problems than they solve - turned into a pretty interesting thriller.<br /><br />Very original approach, unlike anything I recall seeing. The plot takes a dramatic shift mid-way through, and keeps you guessing for the next 20-30 minutes. Even after the big pieces have come together - and the story has crystallized -  there are a few little twists that should keep you interested until the very end.<br /><br />I was interested in viewing the movie I expected to see, but truthfully think I enjoyed the one I actually watched even more. An unexpected ending - where everyone gets what they deserve - was just icing on the cake.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Seems like all you need to know to format your kindle ebook is in here. The details are very specific although the seem a bit tedious. It is well worth the price--free.
B0094WK9EC|5.0|LOVE this album!  I use it during my workouts.  I've listened to it 40+ times and it never gets old!
B00CL50LEC|4.0|Although a little flat at times, it was refreshing to have a feel good monster movie with a happy ending!  My teenage daughter loved it.  :)
1577314808|5.0|This is the first book I found helped me more when listening to the author read the book in the audio version vs reading the book. This book serves to help anyone that is struggling with getting through life. It serves to divide your mind into 2 halves. The ego inside you that wants to be fed by whatever mood it'sin that day and you. The real energy that has been with you since birth. Great quote from book. \\"Have you ever said ,I can't live with myself anymore. Well who is the I and who is the myself\\". Also \\"you are not your mind\\". Best summed up by saying this is a book which will help you get through life by easing the unnessary pressure we put on our self.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I could not stop watching I had to see what was coming next. It is what catches my attention. Excellent
B00932A4XE|2.0|I watched it on the prime acct so it was free. It wasn't funny. I wouldn't pay to rent it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Best kept secret. I love it!!! This series keeps me hitting play. I can't wait to watch season two! Thank goodness there are five seasons.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my 3 yr old daughter loves playing this game. Only problem we have is trying to receive more gems for free
B008MEM24S|5.0|Where's My Perry? is a very fun game. It makes players use their heads to find different solutions to very different and challenging levels, while trying to collect three gnomes at the same time! I know I have definitely had a fun time with this game, it is a great way to pass time and have fun at the same time.<br /><br />I chose this rating because it is a great and fun game. I think this game will be enjoyable to all who try it!
B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book! I read a lot of books and I can honestly say this book is one of my absolute favorites. I loved the writing style. It will keep you laughing. It's a MUST read.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|This book is not great, not bad, It is a very easy beach, pool, or weekend read.  Still worth the time.
B002J2PB10|1.0|the best part of this movie was the previews. I wish I could get a refund on my rental fee. deont waste your time
0385349947|3.0|The book explains that women are in a tight spot in a man's world. If we rebel and assert ourselves, we can get into a mess. So the answer seems to be that we have to keep trying to succeed in the workplace, but it's not easy. She has some tips on how to get ahead.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This book was a great way to think about all aspects of life. If you want to book that will inspire you to stick to your goals, not give up, and to keep trying no matter the hurdles that come your way, this is the book for you. Not only is it well written, but there are so many good quotes in this book that it's worth reading multiple times. I can't wait to read it again!
B0042J6VUS|2.0|I ordered the Skina 3 n 1 detachable lens for mobile phone and digital camera.  However, this won't work with my Nikon digital camera so I won't be able to use the tripod I ordered.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|I really love this movie!!! It was fun to share why I was so enthused by familiar video game characters. My daughter loves the &#34;I did this when I was young&#34; stories. It brought back childhood memories. Good times...good times! We watch movies every weekend and be able to instantly watch on Amazon.com makes it easier for us. This movie rocks!!!!!! Amazon.com rocks!!!! Being able find a great movie and watch it instantly and share it with my 6 year old is truly a priceless moment!!!!! Thanks Amazon.com and Disney.
1400069807|4.0|After this, I'm trying to get some things out of my diet that seem to be on every food label. It lets you know what goes on in the food industry. Best to eat what grows, or has to be killed, for food.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Oh, yes, &#34;Zero Day&#34; is another winner!  It was another Baldacci page turner.  I like a good murder-mystery and I try to second guess who the villian will be.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|But now I have to wait for the next book in the series! How long will we have to wait?
B008Y73940|4.0|Not bad for a free movie...i've seen better McConaughey movies, glad i didnt pay to see it in the theater!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I love this game. My 4, and 6 year old love this game. My husband loves this game. My 12 year old son and daughter love this game. Who doesn't love this game??
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The 'looking-back' perspective gives this book an interesting twist on the genre, as well as the switching between characters, locations, cultures, etc.  It's hard to grasp on to any character as each only gets a handful of pages, so the book is very story-driven...you progress through the events chronologically through the eyes of many, from scientists to military leaders and soldiers, every-day people, politicians and many others.  Along the way, you get each one's thoughts on the subject and the author does a good job giving each a unique voice and personality...even though you don't get a deep knowledge of the characters, it's easy to tell them apart and get a sense of what they're about and what their motivations are.  Reading the different perspectives and reactions one right after the other has a fascinating effect and intentionally or not, the result of this way of telling the story is that the &#34;main character&#34; becomes all of humanity.  I'd give this 4.5 stars if I could...it's not perfect, but quite good and unique.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is the centre of my home entertainment system acting as a remote for spotify. This app has so many uses and if you hook up a pc to your tv, the possibilities are endless.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|This author writes with exquisite pacing. She tells two stories, past and present, side by side, tying together the emotional themes through flowers. Without pulling punches, she juxtaposes poignancy against a hard-scrabble existence where characters arrive in reconciliation despite difficult odds.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|They all tested strong and I replaced all the old batteries in my computers etc.  Work great.  xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx mmmmmmmmm nnnnnnnnnn
B006YC74E8|4.0|I haven't used it much so far, but I am happy with what it can do.  Many only want to give a few effects.  This allows color correction and other higher level edits.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|If you've never played settlers of catan before i would highly recommend this game.<br />a good introduction would be to check out the episode of tabletop where Wil Wheaton and his friends play.<br />here is a link for the lazy<br />http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3WJTlDa7oo
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|While it did not follow the book still it was worth the buy. I have been a fan and this movie worked for me.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I have so much trouble turning my brain off but this app is so relaxing, I fall right to sleep.  I usually set the timer to turn off in 10 minutes and I am gone before it goes off.  The rain and night sounds are my favorites.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I love this book my favorite book.  I wish I could rate this with a 11.  Buy this book definitely  worth it.  I recommend whatever book your reading stop reading it and download this one and read it now. You will fall in love with Drew and Kate like I did.  This book is hilarious sweet HOT HOT HOT and very steamy.  Let's just say you will not be disappointed.
B001M0HGR2|5.0|I really like this movie.  Watch with my family.  Even thought it contains violence, it was an action packed movie where goodness prevails.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|The plot was not very engaging, but I enjoyed some of the unconventional characters, especially Jack Reacher (Cruise did a great job).  Other characters were pretty bland, but I adjusted my expectations based on other reviews, and enjoyed this movie.  A good, basic action movie.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|Is an enjoyable and fascinating look at babies and parents the world over. From grandfather to grandson our entire family enjoyed this film.
B000JO9JHW|4.0|I could not bring myself to save I love a series about a serial killer but it really draws you in.  The setting, the characters and the story are darkly entertaining.  Three's a reason it has lasted seven years.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Both my kids love this game.  I love the fact that they can play by themselves or interact with friends.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|They say that this movie is \\"absolutly terrifying\\" \\"prapare for nightly scares\\" and so on and so forth. I, for one, was originally afraid to watch this movie because of these said quotes, and then some. But, I plucked up courage and watched it, and was very surprised to say the least. This movie was different, I'll say that. I was most definitely expecting something that was going to give me nightmares. No, I'm not saying this movie was stupid, because it wasn't. It was very original and I'm proud of the director and all of the other peeps in the making of this film. It just wasn't scary, that's all. No, scratch that, there was ONE part that made my spine crawl, which was, of course, the very end. I also saw the \\"alternate\\" ending, and that was very eerie as well. They say that 12 people went to the hospital because of this movie. All I have to say to them is: I'm sorry that you couldn't handle something so simple and not scary...at all (This is coming from a CHICKEN!!).
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|I haven't had much time to play around with it - it seems to take a while to open. If it worked a little faster I would play it more.  I will try again.
B00CRW2066|5.0|This album will blow you away. After first listen you may only like a few songs, but if you invest the time you will learn to love each and every song on this album. It matures and evolves with each listen.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I really like this book.  It can make you step back and take a look at your own struggles in a different light.
B006P0FD4W|5.0|\\"Paranormal Activity 3 takes you back to where it all began and the activity is more intense than ever. The cameras are on and recording the chilling moments when evil begins to terrorize young sisters Katie and Kristi for the first time.\\"<br /><br />This is true. I watched this first since this was the prequel. But, the next couple quotes are what really get me.<br /><br />\\"Brace yourself for the horror phenomenon that delivers \\"heart-exploding scares\\"* so frightening that \\"the last 15 minutes will mess you up for life.\\"**<br /><br />*Brad Miska, Bloody Disgusting; **Aint-It-Cool-News<br /><br />Let me say this: yeah, right. I did not receive \\"heart-exploding scares\\" and the last 15 minutes most definitely did not mess me up for life. Yes, the last 2 minutes or so were...different; but most definitely not nightmare inducing. In fact, I slept like a baby the night I watched it. I watched this one first, and then the first one second in one day. This was most definitely my favorite, though, and will most definitely watch it again. I believe that this is the least scariest in the franchise. From least scariest to most, I would have to say:<br /><br />1. Paranormal Activity 3<br /><br />2. Paranormal Activity<br /><br />3. Paranormal Activity 4<br /><br />4. Paranormal Activity 2<br /><br />I'll explain why in my other reviews for the other movies in this series. Though I personally believe this is the least scariest out of all of them, you should most definitely watch it and state your own opinion.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|I don't think I've ever had another book, save only The Slight Edge, more profoundly impact my philosophy of success. If you've ever experienced frustration in trying to get people to change their mind about, well, ANYTHING, this book will show you what you're doing wrong and engage your brain int he process of solving said problems.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I will truly miss Sookie and the gang but all good things must come to an end. At least I can relish it with True Blood. I have no idea why everyone is so upset over how the author ended the series. It makes perfect sense to me. Read it and decide for yourself.
B008Y6RYDS|5.0|Well done...I still hate the ending and wish it had been reversed.  I'm pretty sure there will never be a remake on this one.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I enjoy the graphics and the puzzles. anyone who is into hidden object games would enjoy this game in its entirety
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I am a long time fan of Star Trek and I'm so glad they made this movie and kept to th original story lines and characterizations.
B004QPOVF0|5.0|Very good production and awesome music.<br />Recommend it to any AC/DC fan.<br />This is the best Live recording of any group I have watched.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|came in a decent pace. the box was brand new, so it was like i got it in the store for 1/2 the price
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series it is one of my favorite books it is so much worth the total cost DOWNLOAD NOW!!!!!!!!
B005HSL626|5.0|It is a lot of fun, sort of reminds me of the one on the Wii system.  Now I can practice and hopefully win  a few and not get clobbered by my 5 yr old grandson.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I absolutely loved this game.  It was fun. The  graphics were excellent and just a little creepy.  The storyline was good. The hidden object games and puzzles weren't so difficult that I became frustrated and quit. This was a long game and I highly recommend it.
B002BBJ52U|4.0|Is it just me or is Justin Long a Hottie?! Well, now that I've gotten that out the way, I liked this movie. Gennifer Goodwin was adorably fantastic in this movie and she makes you want to never give up on finding love. I also loved Ben and Jen's chemistry in this film, they felt like a real couple to me.<br />So if you are looking for a nice movie to kick up your feet to after a long day of work and you just want to relax and eat some popcorn, then this is the movie for you. Yes, it is a chick flick, but it is a funny chick flick that will make you smile. It is worth the watch.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Awesome show. just found it and love it. sam, dean, castiel - want bobby back tho - cant wait for it to be on netflix
B009MYARIK|2.0|As a Sophie Kinsella fan, I was anxiously awaiting the release of this new book.  Unfortunately, this book is lacking.  The story was silly and unbelievable.  The antics on the wedding night were so ridiculous, I just skipped pages to get past it.  I didn't find it humorous in the least. The main characters were hardly likeable, although some sub-characters had potential.  I sincerely hope future books by this author have qualities found in earlier books such as &#34;I've Got Your Number&#34;, &#34;Twenties Girl&#34;, &#34;Can You Keep a Secret&#34;.  For those of you who still want to read this book, I recommend waiting until it comes out in paperback to save some money.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great Graphics and visuals.  Good Story line.  This game was just diffucult enough to keep my interest but not frustrate me into quitting.  This is a long game-you get your money's worth.  I recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Must read!!!<br />I would of never guessed that ending! I was very shocked! The author did a great job leaving me on the edge of my feet as I turned each page!
1577312082|5.0|so far the cd's i have used have been in working condition.  Hallelujah!!  since the shipping took a bite out of the packaging causing the case to be broken.  I surely was worried.  but not to fear Ekart Tolle is here.  Thanks for responding to my query about the cd case and you were going to take care of any problem I have that is a PLUS.  thanks again for the opportunity to be able to purchase this item.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It was nice to watch a show that isn't out to out-stab, or out murder another show on TV.  The period dress is fabulous.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is absolutly the best TV show on right now.  It has great writing and effects but the most interesting thing about this show is the characters.  Watching the characters make their choices and try to survive in terrible conditions is riveting.  I was hooked from season one.  Don't miss this show.
B000LC51TM|4.0|Good live music.  German industrial rock at it's best.  Also comes with DVD that has performances from several stops on the tour.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|never a dull moment, keeps me wondering what will be on the next episode. Great cast, keep the shows coming.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|This movie was incredible. The iPad clarity was incredible. Too bad it didn't come with mega speakers and sub woofers!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a short game but alot of fun.  First rate graphics.  The puzzles aren't so difficult that you lose interest. Can't wait for the second chapter.
B00B4804KS|5.0|VCR'S, Lazer Disc's, DVD'S do not come close to this Bluray and all the other goodies. I do not have a 3D TV but I am sure it would be totally awesome in 3D!!! It puts you in the movie and I am totally blown away, it is even much, much more scary than all the other formats. I have a 15&#34; Velodine sub woofer and I thought the ceiling would cave in on me!!!!! Parents beware it is very, very, very graphic and you should consider not letting your younger children view this all time classic!! I can watch all three movies every month and cannot get enough. My wife ask's me not to mouth all the words but I do anyway. Get it and you will not be disapointed. What a deal, what a movie, what a picture and what great sound!
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|Worth the $2.99 that I paid for it. It suprisingly held my attention even though the acting was sub par,
B003G4W49C|5.0|Creative, wonderful, smart, funny, sad, thought provoking. This book is good. I read it in a weekend it was a page turner. You truly go through this story feeling part of it.
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I really enjoyed this game but had massive problems with it.  It just wouldn't save my game and several times I opened the kindle to play and it would make me buy the same shark that I just bought the day before.  I do not recommend  this game until that issue is solved.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|Totally awesome!!! Bluray and Dinosaurs what a couple! Get it you will not be sorry! The difference between my VCR, DVD and my Lazerdisc's was awesome. But bluray put's you right there with stunning visuals and brain shattering music!!!!!! It is so improved I do not suggest younger children watch it. Parents beware it is shocking how realistic it is.
B0006399FS|4.0|i think that u2 is coming to the end of a great run in music. the c-d has some good songs on it that i like.  but i feel they are not as sharp as in the past. i thank them for all the great music over the years.
1451695195|5.0|I find myself speaking of this book all the time and buying copies to give away. The is nothing more real than what is beyond the very limited reality we humans construct and enforce every day. Dr. Alexander shares a glimpse into a reality that challenges all assumptions and pulls us toward wholeness and love. What a blessing to know what he shares and to realize that our loved ones who go before us are very near to us.<br /><br />There are several reviews that rate this book as poor but in most of the ones I read, they did not understand that Dr. Alexander gives words to the ineffable. They fault him for not going into more depth about his NDE. The fact that he even tried to describe it is an accomplishment and a gift. Some critics also dislike him writing about his life but I don't understand why. What he experienced is deeply inter-related to life now and life to come. It's about relationships and how they affect us now and in what will be.
B0041LG08U|5.0|A great timepiece with an excellent value for money, you get a stylish automatic watch that pays tribute to Blancpain's Fifty Fathoms series. The pictures here do not do it justice and I strongly recommend to do a Google image search for SNZH53.
B002W5GPVE|5.0|Yin's the expert on Case Study research. This is the book you go to when you're considering using that qualitative or mixed method. He walks you through what you need and provides plenty of references to research for more information. I'm also glad this was in Kindle format. I'm running out of space with all the books for my dissertation.
B000001EAQ|3.0|i am a fan of this group from the 1st recording. i have most of there music so i put this with the other ones i have. it is a good but not great c-d. you can check it out to see if you like it.
1878424319|3.0|And perhaps a little too practical. I enjoyed the book, but it was not what I expected. It is plain and simple, with not much depth and content. It is what it is, and would make a great starting place for those who are looking for the way to simplify life by eliminating a lot of drama. The points are well-made, and written in a way to hold your attention. I read this book along with &#34;The Untethered Soul&#34; by Michael Singer, which I really enjoyed more. In reading the two books together, Agreements made for a nice place to get my feet back on the ground. I consider it worth the money and a great gift for the &#34;drama Queen&#34; in your life.
B00136JPB0|4.0|I'm new to Jeff Buckley but so far.....excellent.  I will buy more of his music in the future. I really like his technique and presentation to the music.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent legal drama...with several stories going on at the same time.  Acting by Margulies and Baranski, very good.  Many episodes available.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Before I started watching this movie, I was thinking how in the world could anyone make a movie with a boy and a tiger in the middle of the ocean worth watching. I couldn't even think of one thing that would make it remotely interesting, but this movie surprised me. The beginning won me over with its witty moments. For instance, Pi discovered Islam and then practiced it. Then, I imagine it wasn't a day later he was asking to be baptized in the traditional Christian manner. Pi's mother could only smile. His father thought it was foolish. The story continues and eventually, he discovers Richard, the Bengal tiger, and he is taught a lesson about what the animal really is. I don't think he learned anything from that lesson, and I don't think he ever does. The story kept moving and eventually went to the ship sinking and how Pi came to survive with the tiger.<br /><br />I will admit I was surprised and at awe at this movie. It was thoughtfully written and beautifully presented. I was most interested in the floating carnivorous island, and all the meerkats. That part was so cool, and I was just smiling while watching that part of it. Everyone involved in the creation of this movie did a great job. The hard work and creativity involved did not escape me, and I am glad I took the time to watch it. It was truly refreshing, new, and breathtaking.<br /><br />If this movie won awards for any of the people that worked on it, they surely deserved it. I highly recommend this movie.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|the name says  it all.  puzzles your mind without testing your fingers (unless you play the timed version) .  low -  key entertainment for you brain.
B00CW665VI|5.0|This was a pleasure to read.  I seriously laughed out loud multiple times throughout!  It was light, hot, steamy and hilarious.

B0064MPXFA|5.0|The story lines are well written and the suspense keeps you coming back for more.  I started watching the series from episode 1 to bring myself up to speed and was hooked ever since.  My wife is not a big fan, but we have different viewing tastes. The series covers all the popular topics in our culture and news.
B00785P2QC|3.0|lots of fun however there should be a way to play without the facebook requirements.  I like to play without bothering my friends.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED. ALL EPISODES PLUS WEBIODES AND DELETED SCENES. GREAT DVD.  LOOKING FORWARD TO PURCHASE SEASON 3 FOR SUMMER TIME ENJOYMENT.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|Enough said. I live very close to him. I have always been a huge fan of Mr. Sparks. I can honestly say I have loved and enjoyed all but one of his novels. He has a way with his words and details that make you fill one with the story. I am bad for being harsh if a movie is not done to emulate the book that it is based on. With that being said I was very surprised in the production and the actors in this movie. I cried so that was a Plus!! Can't say the same for Dear John, now that was a let down.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|This is a great series with a great cast you watch the pilot and your hooked! It will keep you guessing.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This movie is on of the few movies that focus beyond a stunt action or even a particular emotion. The meat of this movie is in understanding the characters' interactions and their dynamic personalities.
B00C391Y3I|5.0|I just picked this up at Best Buy for $13.99 on BD.  Popped it in, thinking OK, let's see how good this really is...I am blown away!!!!  I have all of Halfords live dvd releases (Rio, Japan, and Anaheim) plus I've got the Judas Priest Angel dual disc and have seen the Rising in the East concert before...and to my surprise, Rob Halford screams his arse off better than any of the other mentioned concerts!!!  It's like he is truly an immortal Metal God! He sounds amazing on this release, and I am so pleased I got this.  The rest of the boys are a well oiled machine, even Richie Faulkner does not miss a beat.  A pleasant surprise, and definitely worth repeated viewings!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great App. lots of information. Easy to understand and is reasonably accurate. I do recommend it to all.
B003M70O5O|3.0|Sons of Anarchy is an entertaining show, but this show is also a bit full of itself and slightly ridiculous.  That being said I will be watching Season 3 and beyond.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The Blu-ray/DVD Combo was exactly what I ordered. Shipping was very fast and at a great price! I plan to purchase more in the future.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Everyone in my house loves playing this game.  It's addictive.  I also played the other  Cut the Rope  game and liked it so much I couldn't wait to play this one.
B008Y73940|5.0|loved the movie, has some real good twists and main character is a front lines type guy that isn't afraid to mix it up with the big players.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|As always...Sparks did a wonderful job. If you have already seen the movie, you need to still read the book. They are both good, but the book is so much more. You will not be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Too much tum. Very addictive. I play on my kindle and on my phone. My 13 yr old son introduced me to this game.
B009NY43NY|4.0|I thought the book was an appropriate ending to the sookie saga. It was not the ending I would have liked because I always wanted her with Eric!
B00821OX98|5.0|The acting, the character development is all superb.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this show.  Well worth the time to catch up for the new season coming up.
B0087EACJK|5.0|This is a great game.  It starts out at a pretty easy level and then adds one new thing at a time.  The instructions are pretty straight forward.  Twice I got a little confused about how to pass a level but I looked online and got a hint.  Besides that this has been a lot of fun.
B0094K20FK|5.0|Now that I have seen (new) Star Trek into Darkness, I can appreciate the &#34;original&#34; Khan story line. See this!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A nice, easy, but suspenseful read. A book that will make you compassionate, empathetic, but especially grateful - particularly if you have children!
B001TH16DS|5.0|This movie its great. Ass a movie I like it too much. I give five starts because its the TV show I tried to watch for years it cames 100 % new.
B003ASLJMW|5.0|Nothing beat the old classics. Eastwood the pilot, the spy, and the Vietnam Era Vet with flashbacks.  This movie even has a Vintage Featurette.  What more can you ask for....
B005H9B44A|4.0|I was never a big superhero fan, but this movie is helping to change my mind. The action and special effects were good and I enjoyed the story line. I also liked how it set  up for a sequel and for the Avengers. I enjoy watching movies where characters cross over. It also helps that they chose Chris Helms for the actor - nice, very nice!
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|This book was almost painful to read. Not humorous. Very annoying. I only finished it because the description on the jacket indicated that there was some life-changing event that occurs when she writes about a story she cares about. That does happen but not until the final 1/4 of the book. The first 3/4 is monotonous and frustrating as there's no satisfactory character development. The lead character appears to have no redeeming qualities. She tells lie after lie with no end. I was hoping for a light, entertaining summer read but this was truly not it.
B00A757EFW|1.0|this is game is horrible. it stinks on a kindle fire and I hate it. do not get this game. don't bother to download it,  if u do,  u will see y.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are superb. The logic is sound and the game is very hard to put down. Well presented. I will get the next edition when it comes out.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I like this movie because the storyline is very positive and the moral should be easily understood by younger children. The main character, Ralph, plays the &#34;bad guy&#34; in a video game. He isn't like that in real life, but the game has him stereotyped and none of the characters want him to or think he can change.<br /><br />Ralph sets out to change who he is by winning a medal, but in the end, realizes that a medal doesn't define who he is.<br /><br />I also liked this movie because there wasn't any &#34;real&#34; violence and the the language is limited to things like &#34;Doody-head&#34;.<br />In all, it's a good family movie
B002WJI66C|5.0|THEY CAME FAST AND MY GRANDSON WAS HAPPY....I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS SUPER MARIO BROS. PRODUCT TO ANY ONE WHO LIKES STUFF ANIMAL/TOYS.
1863514201|3.0|I have other books in the Milner Craft Series.  The pictures were beautiful but the &#34;lessons&#34; were not any different than their other books.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|From the Raiders of the Lost Ark opening, to the blending of The Undiscovered Country and Wrath of Khan plot lines, it just disappoints on so many levels. Instead of a true 'reboot' for a new generation of fans, we get a 'rehash' of moribund plot lines borrowed from 4 decades of Trek. 'ST Into Dumbness' is so unoriginal and derivative that I just can't forgive JJ Abrams for making this piece of crap. He could have gone anywhere after the first film rebooted the storyline, but he chose to reach into the Star Trek goodie bag and make a ridiculous film only a dull child weaned on bad sci-fi could love. Absolute garbage.
0143038419|3.0|I purchased this book for a newly single lady also looking for a change....and it worked! The book was inspiring and entertaining!
B0084IHVC0|5.0|THEY DID IT AGAIN..THIS TIME I READ SEEN THE SPECIAL FEATURES AND GOT A LOT OF INFORMATION THAT I HAD NO CLUE ON THE VOICES/CHARACTERS AND EVEN THE SONG WRITERS ALL I CAN SAY TO SUM IT UP DISNEY MAKES DREAMS COME TRUE IN PICTURE/MOVIES
B00A757EFW|3.0|boring and frustrating, cannot make my finger touch known fast enough to move the pacman before he gets eaten, okay if you are really bored.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|It's a fun game! Just as good as the others. Formula hasn't gotten stale yet... Which is a surprise considering how quickly another mega-popular bird-based franchise became boring.
B00CUWKHVI|2.0|Dear Mr. Cullum,<br /><br />I cannot begin to express how disappointed I am in your most recent offering \\"Momentum\\". You seem to have abandoned your past jazz and contemporary influences in favor of cliché and dull pop. You seemed to have pulled a \\"Benjamin Button\\" on us. When you were younger your musical maturity was beyond your years demonstrating an awareness and a talent that sometimes eclipsed those who inspired you.  Now you seem to have \\"immatured\\" into creating meaningless pop songs. You are so much more talented than you demonstrate on this album. Please do not continue in this direction. I am not saying that I am opposed to your original compositions and ventures into other forms than jazz and standards. Your last album \\"The Pursuit\\" was fantastic. You managed a great mix of standards and smart contemporary songs without compromising your immense talent.<br /><br />Gone are your keen interpretations and rendering of jazz and contemporary standards with stellar compositions. Gone are the wonderful songs you penned that had heart and feeling. Gone are piano interludes that showed your immense talent. All this seemed to have been replaced by weak mundane songs with trivial \\"keyboard\\" solos sounding as if they were done on some cheap electric keyboard. The drums on any song are monotonous and simple sounding, as if they were played by about anyone who could keep a simple beat. My gosh, you even use a drum program on some songs. Ughh....<br /><br />And the mix! The entire thing sounds over compressed. Do you really think that adding a thumping pounding bass line in NEARLY ALL the songs will do what? Appeal to a younger audience? I was getting a headache in my car until I turned the bass just about all the way down. At home, I had to turn my sub-woofer completely off. You begin to show your genius on Anthony Newley's \\"Pure Imagination\\" but the thumping bass simply ruins what could have been a beautiful rendition of the song. \\"Love for Sale\\" by Cole Porter is simply destroyed when you attempt at rap, hip-hop, or whatever you want to call it with Roots Manuva and the electronic sound effects. The bass goes way over the top of everything making the song almost unlistenable. I tried it on everything I have and it sounded bad on everything.<br /><br />I am unsure of just who you are marketing \\"Momentum\\"? Surely it cannot be your past fan base. I think you may find that we are a more mature crowd, who enjoy rock, jazz and contemporary music and are quite put off by the trivial pop music so prevalent in today's main stream. If this is your foray into more mainstream pop then I hope it is indeed short lived. Please get back to what I feel you do best; smart, sophisticated contemporary music, that has some creativity and self-expression to it. I was hoping for some insight in the liner notes but no hint as to why you have chosen this direction.<br />I will continue to recommend your music to those who appreciate mature contemporary music but I will be sure to tell them to stay clear of \\"Momentum\\". I just hope they read this letter before they purchase it and therefore never look at any of your other music ever again.<br /><br />For those who read this letter and wish to criticize my take on \\"Momentum\\" please listen to \\"TwentySomething\\" or \\"The Pursuit\\" and then tell me that this album can compare in either quality or substance. I'll give it two stars simply based on his past performance and my desire not to completely heave the whole thing as worthless.
B00005JO5L|5.0|WHAT CAN I SAY FROM START TO FINISH THIS MOVIE IS NOTHING SHY OF A SUSPENSEFUL AUDIENCE AND A GREAT STORY
B0086700CM|4.0|I enjoy this app. a lot being a mother of three and who has a husband who gets board pretty easily....
B0019WQIPE|5.0|A classic movie, awesome music and acting, excellent story based on true facts. Not your typical happy ending movie, more like real life...
B000SEGTI0|5.0|This book was awesome. It explores deep concepts, like how one should define humanity, and what roll empathy plays in determining the worth of a person. It's also an entertaining story that kept me interested all the way until the end, which is something that a lot of other philosophical type stories have failed to do.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I enjoyed playing very much.  I Will be seeing the movie when it comes out. The forest is beautiful<br />Warriors riding  hummingbirds come to the rescue!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|Easy to keep updated and in touch.  I get the information whenever and wherever and much faster staying in touch.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Just like all T Cruise movies, this one is terrible.  In fact, it's just as terrible as the name would indicate.  Very obvious and cliche plotline and characters.<br /><br />Save yourself some money, time and self-respect and just Jack Reacher yourself
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|This movie was like nothing I have ever seen! From start to finish it was amazing, a bit violent, but it is rated R :P The soundtrack was super also! LOVE LOVE LOVE!
B004W1GCNC|4.0|I really enjoyed the original series and this one is good however it doesn't have the sincerity and warmth of the original series.
B005DOKK7Q|1.0|Seemed like the perfect, no frills case, but it simply does not fit! You can force the zipper to close, but at great risk to the case and the Kindle; you'll only try that once. Strangely, the description says \\"does not fit the Kindle Fire 7 inch.\\" That's the smallest Kindle Fire there is; The Fire HD is even bigger!
0811879542|5.0|I bought this for my fiancee for christmas and she loves this book, she reads it to her kindergarden class and they love it!
B0091VTISO|3.0|Movie was ok. Nothing spectacular. Graphics are nice. Sounds ok. Effects are not too particularly impressive. But it is still an ok movie to watch. I would not watch it again.
1449410243|2.0|This book was very boring and I got tired of reading it after a few pages. The problem is the repetition. It's only about cats and I just can't keep getting entertained by the same thing. My opinion is, he should just make more books like how he wrote 5 Very Good Reasons To Punch a Dolphin.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|I initially resisted seeing this movie, however, being such a huge Reacher fan I gave in and decided to take the plunge.  Well that was 2+ hours of my life I'll never get back.  Such a waste of time and energy.  I so hope that they STOP and not try make another.  I'm not sure any actor could truly capture the essence of this character ~ I knew when announced and my suspensions were confirmed that Cruise was/is NOT the actor for this part.<br /><br />I so wish I could have at least liked this movie.
B0084IG8TM|3.0|This was a good movie, i have not read the book so i cant say anything about that but it was good. Not one of my favorites though,

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Our family really likes this movie so I ordered it because we lost the first copy. Has a great story with a plot twist.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My kids loved this Matilda movie. They like how she grows up self sufficient and all the antics she is upto.
B00BSBXA98|5.0|Enjoyable entertainment for all. Watching the show in the comfort of your home is a different experience but enjoyable nonetheless. My ten year old loves to view his favorite scenes over and over.
B000SEHJGQ|2.0|A friend whose opinion on literature I respect commented about this author by saying, \\"Not one of my favorites.\\" Well, now I can see why and I can agree with him. \\"Ham On Rye\\" is violent, vulgar, and vicious. Some critics spoke of the author's humor. I found none. I was too busy avoiding the bloodshed and anger to find it. I can now say I read a book by Bukowski. I can now say I'll not be tempted to read another.
B008JFUORW|4.0|Moviegoers want sequels, that's why they are made. As fans, we want to see more and learn more about the characters we know and love, but no matter how good that sequel is, not all of the fans are going to like it. If the movie is too much like the first one, the fans say it's the same movie, but if it's too different, they say it doesn't fit the story. The only place the writers/producers are going to win is at the box office, because no matter the reviews, they know people are going to come and see it. The Hangover Part III is getting terrible reviews from fans, because it's not what they expected. It's not as funny as the first one or even the second one, in fact, this film is much more dramatic than the rest of the films in the series, but it not necessarily a bad thing. Alan may not have had a ton of funny lines and Stu's girlish screaming may have run it's course, but this was still a really good story. Using flashbacks from the original, Todd Phillips introduces us to a part of the story that we didn't even know existed until now. This time, they skip the hangover and the wolf pack needs to go on an adventure to capture Mr. Chow. Four years ago, Chow ripped off another gangster and that gangster kidnaps Doug and threatens to kill him unless the wolf pack can bring him Chow. The story was solid and included some of the comedy we love along with dramatic elements and even a couple of really exciting chase scenes. No, this film was not the hangover we've come to love and expect. The clever one-liners aren't there, there's no wedding to prepare for, and the stakes are much higher this time, but all in all the story was very solid and the performances were fantastic. This film was a great way to end the story of the wolf pack, yet many fans and critic alike insist on comparing it to the first one. This film is much different than the original, too different in the opinions of many. If you want to compare Part III to the original Hangover, than no it's nowhere nearas good, but if you look at it based on it's own merits, it's a pretty solid film, albeit much different from what was expected.
B009X00E18|3.0|It is good protection for the Kindle Fire, but the mechanism for standing up doesn't work very well--tends to fall over easily.

B0031Q0XCA|1.0|This movie was one of the worse movies I have ever seen. We quit watching after 20 minutes. I have seen home movies that were more interesting.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|The movie will well done.  Very good acting, My friends and I truly enjoyed the move.  There several twist that made you stop and think.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Ok, so Star Trek is now Star Wars with stupid, unoriginal plot lines perfect for 12 year olds. This film like the first 'reboot' has nothing that made Star Trek enjoyable.  JJ Abrams is just lazy here, its a muddled mess that wastes some valiant efforts by some good actors.  I wish I had the 2 hours back I wasted on this.<br />Those of you who are wondering how this crap got the Star Trek name, here is explanation:  Rick Berman, Roddenberry's handpicked successor's contract was allowed to expire at the end of 2005/2006 under the orders of Gail Berman (no relation to Rick), who was then President of Paramount pictures before moving on. She vetted J.J. Abrams who was making a name for himself in sci-fi television and films to inherit the Star Trek franchise. It was her belief that Star Trek needed rebooting, that it was dead as a money-making intellectual property due to the poor box office returns of the last two TNG films. Abrams works with a close-knit group of writers, musicians, producers on various projects, in inheriting Star Trek, Star Trek inherited the talents, or lack thereof of his creative team, who had no previous involvement in making Star Trek. So instead of getting veteran Star Trek professionals we ended up with a bunch of newbies, which included few Trek fans, notably Robert Orci, whose grasp of Trek is weak and superficial to say the least. Orci and Kurtzman, the screenwriters on Abrams' Trek films are best known for screenwriting the Transformers films, that's whose writing Star Trek now! The Transformers films are brain-dead science fiction films that are heavy on action and visual effects, and weak on story and character development. Hence, we get Transformers quality Star Trek.
B0014DW3OS|5.0|Denzel Washington shines like a diamond with his performance in this movie. Ethan Hawke is good too.<br />Eva Mendes is HOT HOT HOT and a wonderful actress too.

B002XXPNXG|4.0|How do they manage risk?  How do they protect themselves?  How do they manage closeness?  What is the role of memory?  How do we explain ourselves?  How do we hear the other's explanations?

B00CRW2066|3.0|Every song is a long drawn out slog. I have enjoyed their previous albums because they would break up the dreary stuff with some (somewhat ironically) brighter songs. This one just hits the minor chords over and over and over until it stops. None of the songs are bad. There is some good stuff here, just nothing to tap your toes to.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|It was advertised as a 2 disc special collector's edition of Star Trek V the final frontier,what was received was 6 special featured disc of all Star Trek movies

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a gripping novel from the very beginning.  One of Grisham's best.  I recommend it for all of Grisham's fans and even those who aren't.
B005HSL626|4.0|Found this app was able to help kill 12 hours on a plane... would down load it again... buy buy buy...
B00BIVN82M|2.0|As a long time Buble fan I found this album quite mediocre at best. There's only one song I really like, Come Dance with Me.  I agree with all the other reviews asking why on earth they would pick Resse Witherspoon to sing with Michael. The only thing reason I can think of is, maybe it was her studio.<br /><br />I also recorded all the TV appearances last month promoting the album. In only one did Michael even sound half way decent. It's like he's not even trying. If he was a contestent on an Idol like show, he'd be booted in the first round. Based on those performances, I'll skip this years concert tour (we've seen him four times since 2005).
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|it reminds me of the earlier versions of the video games,the only thing i don't like is you have<br />to be connected to the internet to play it.

B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Patchworkz is fun and challenging, but the last bonus section won't open up after I've finished everything else. I can't figure out how to open it up. So I keep working the puzzles over, because they come up different each time. Great!
B00CLVF2N6|1.0|What a waste.  Not only of my dollars to rent but the time spent watching it the talented people saddled with trying to make this dodo fly.  One does wonder how this stuff gets made.  I'm sure that it sounded good in the pitch.  But the story is utterly lacking.  There is no character development, no arc of change to make them interesting.  A gory rehash of concepts that were dredged from other movies.  The effects are shiny and well executed... but, so what!  Who cares if there isn't a story.  Both of the main actors plod through this like they're on morphine... (or wish they were.)  Why?!  Because there is nothing for them to act with.  The dialog is banal.  The action is derivative.  The direction is uninspired.  Watching this left me feeling like I just drank a month old glass of warm, flat, coke.  I feel pity for everyone involved.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|The best on television. True to its time period, it invites those with the inclination to learn more about history after viewing events which have affected the family so profoundly.  The actors are wonderfully believable and you find yourself pulling for their every success or hoping they get their just desserts, in either case, you forget they are acting and consider them the character they portray.<br /><br />Even the stoggiest among us will enjoy the final outcome of this season.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This product looks great. Over all impressive design and color. Perfect size and fits right in the charging port in the car.<br />The car charger I got is very similar but has a built in micro usb cord for android devices which works fine.<br />I have been using this car charge for 3 days now and it is very easy to use and makes life much easier. In past sometimes I used to forget to charge my ipod/iphone (which I use it to listen to music in car). Now I do not worry about that anymore. If it is not charged, I can just hook it up in this car charger while charging my htc one at same time. Impressively it charges both phone and iphone fast enough.<br />This car charger is a great deal for customers like me who use phone and ipod at same time while driving. Also, I use my phone a lot so it is a great gadget to keep my phone charged without worrying about phone dying on you.<br />I haven't used any other product like this before. There are other companies with similar products, but I feel this one is a cool looking gadget with both ipod/iphone and android device charging capabilities.<br />Overall a great product. Deserves 5 star. A must buy if you are looking for a product like this one which helps you charge your two devices at same time. Highly recommended.
B000IDGBWU|5.0|Its such a timeless classic! Who couldnt love these two and the dancing and the story behind true love never gets old. We need more movies like this so this generation can know what true love is all about.
B006YC74E8|4.0|This ap works well, not as well as i would have hoped with more new features, but well enough for me.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Bears some resemblance to Cook County judicial reality. Fast moving. Character development is outstanding. Look forward to each new episode. Introduction of new characters is timely and appropriate.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a really fun game to pass the time when you are bored. Even though you can't play a whole course it is still fun.
B0046B4VXQ|4.0|I saw this years ago as a teenager and every time I watch it I still get chills.  This is vintage and anyone interested in the horror genre should see this one at least once.  Even if you don't like it, you'll be treated to younger versions of John Travolta, Sissy Spacek and let's not forget the Greatest American Hero, William Katt?  That tuxedo is awesome!  Piper Laurie's obsessive, crazy, and overbearing mother character creeps me out.  Very well done, if not extremely dated.  Can't believe it's forty years old almost! \\"They're all gonna laugh at you!\\" gets drummed into your head until it reaches a hypnotic frenzy and all hell breaks loose.  Timeless.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|So maybe I read too fast, but the political intrigues and minutiae really bogged me down.  By the end, I found myself just skimming over the &#34;he said, she said, spy vs spy&#34; stuff, as I just couldn't keep straight who was in what political party, who the (real life) leaders were and what battle was happening with which division.  If I ever read this again, I'll truly need to keep a notebook with me and jot down who is who, all after spending time researching the differences in Communism, Labour, Nazis, Fascists, etc., and who hated who and who supported who.  The characters got lost in the real history & politics.
B003E74B24|5.0|This is a very quick read (I read it in an afternoon) but it was very interesting, providing us with lots of information about the humble beginning of Gordon Ramsay, showing us a success story that proves that hard work and knowing what you want is a way to achieve success.<br />An enlighting insight of the beginnings of the celebrity chef. A perfect way to know (quickly) a lot about him.<br /><br />Recommended!
B008N1V11U|5.0|The best Game ever on my kindle. This is the best game ever everything is so clear nd fun am addicted to it already..
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Haven't heard these kids since Dirt, but I was bored one day and saw this piece of work on Amazon....bought it, played it, loved it.  You want beats?  You got it.  You want dope rhymes?  You got it.  You want SURF GUITAR?  You got it!  Listen, it's all here, in durable, eco-friendly packaging...so the dolphins will be safe.<br /><br />The point of all of this is that this is a GREAT, FUN-FILLED album that is family-oriented and SAFE for the kids.<br /><br />Rock on!
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|Overall, this movie was okay.  I am glad I watched it as a rental rather than seeing it in the theater.  I was disappointed with the casting.  Individually, I like all of the actors in this film, however, Sean Penn came across as a cartoon version of himself (think Bugsy with Madonna).  I love Emma Stone, but this was not the film for her.  It is difficult to relate to her as the love interest of Sean Penn's character.  An actress that radiates more maturity would have been more believable.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A bit choppy at the beginning, but comes together quickly.  Will always read Mitch Albom books.  They always grab your<br />interest, written so well and a pleasure to read.
B0027MJU00|3.0|Although this work is disturbing, it certaily should be read.  Once again Gillian does a great job of character development and spins a captivating tale.  jf
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was a fascinating read.  Very intriguing psychological thriller..  I was home sick and read it in 24 hours.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Without a doubt, this story was one of the BEST books I've read in a very long time. I could not put this book down, it was my constant companion these last couple of days. I barely slept to finish it and I can't wait for more!!! Great characters, riveting twists and turns, thoughtful plot....I can't say enough nice things about... Everyone READ THIS BOOK! :-)
B0018CMJSU|5.0|i had this collection on VHS and i figured since its been outdated why not upgrade to a DVD !! at an awesome price why not take advantage !! this classic never disappoints, this is definately one of Pacino's top performance just like his other classics - Scarface, Heat, A Dog Day Afternoon, Serpico, Scent of a Women, Carlito's Way and many more !!  so if your a fan of Al Pacino and have never seen this before, you are lost in space...  so definately get this, this classic will never disappoint whatsoever !!
B009YU62H2|4.0|A few too many grinding, rhythmic songs.... could pick up the pace at times.... but still, a very solid reunion. I'd check out anything this lineup releases in the future.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Funny, great story, and I love the dynamic between Harvey and Mike. I would definitely recommend this to anyone! Season 2 is even better!
B00CW665VI|4.0|Tangled is one of those books where I practically smile throughout the entire book! It was cute, funny, witty, and just a really good story. I really enjoyed reading the male point of view and some of his thoughts on things (especially women) were hilarious!
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Humorous ... but not on a topic that needs humor. Tarantino should either attempt a really serious historic piece, or go all-out with gangsta comedy.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love the game and its super fun I just wish that the gems cost money. Like the being able to buy the gems with the coins you earn.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|This movie takes on an interesting dilemma as it forces you to make a judgement on the impedance of following laws. I found myself going back and forth on my support for Whip. Definitely worthwhile. You won't be disappointed if you like most Denzel movies either.<br /><br /> caution there is some full frontal nudity in the first 10 minutes that is out of place from the rest of the movie. I really don't understand why it was included.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|There is nothing new here, most of this information is readily  available on the Kindle site, it's ok for newbies
B004U8VWLE|2.0|Kinda dark for me.  I can think of other actors that should have won Oscars.  Dancing scenes were well done.
B002KC8BSO|5.0|Bruce Campbell is incredible. Make sure to watch evil dead 1 / 2 beforehand.  Then YouTube the alternate ending. This is what film is all about.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|An excellent and entertaining film. Pure fiction.  You will LOVE this if you are an anti-Stratfordian.  Also if you like Ben Jonson, who plays a major role in the story, along with Christopher Marlowe.  Fun fun fun!  But fiction.  A Ghastly portrayal of Elizabeth I as crazed whore, losing her marbles.
B001XV09UG|3.0|Cruise and Kidman are as usual good and interesting.  The story itself, however, is unrealistic and at the end I think back and said to myself: So what?
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I went to see the movie. I loved it. It was there that I was captured by the musical score. As soon as I got back home, I purchased it. Very beautiful music. I love it!
0307341550|4.0|I've never read a book with so many dislikable characters, even the one who is supposed to be the heroine. But perhaps that's what made this book so likeable; nobody was beyond reproach. The main family and all of those in supporting roles were dysfunctional. HA! Great mind trip from reality.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|Season 7 of Dexter was very exciting, alot happening and some new faces.  Now we can't wait until season 8 is over and released.  Really enjoyed!!!
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Finally a movie showing the protection of God for those who He selected.  Fiction movie with a true revealed. The history remember an old movie from Vandamme called Cyborg.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Best book of the series! I couldn't put it down! Non stop action from start to finish. I loved it
0679805273|5.0|Using this for a graduation gift for my daughter... I am getting every teacher to sign this and I will present it to my daughter when she graduates High School! I saw this idea on Pinterest! :)
B007CF7L9O|5.0|I do not think there is a better Braqueosaurio this, a thousand times better than any Schleich. It has a great size and the maximum level of detail, a buy super recommended, the price is worth the figure you're buying. The shipping was fast, was on time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it.. but um... PC WAYYYY better! if you have this on kindle fire buy pocket editor pro. it lets you HACK
B000YAA68C|5.0|This was a beautiful story, and it makes you want to watch it over and over. I just hope we all find love like in this movie. To be loved so much is a wonderful thing.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|The most underrated band still......this recording may not quite equal \\"Black Gives Way to Blue\\" but what does in recent memory?!!  I consider BGWTB to be a masterpiece franky.  \\"The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here\\" is strong from beginning to end.  I personally think it has a slightly harder edge and I love that!<br /><br />Few bands these days can create continuous music that really creates a mood like Alice In Chains.  Just excellent!
B006M4F67A|3.0|This game is okay - I am glad I did not pay for the app.  I do not play it as often as I thought I would.
B00CL50KDY|3.0|For all the gory zombie movies, this one has the &#34;love conquers all&#34; twist.  It is cute and funny when you need a break.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This show selects actors who are excellent at developing characters.  Outstanding is the actors who developed recurring characters; very entertaining and keeps  you wanting more.
B00881PTRC|3.0|The Hangman game is okay.  I don't play it as often as I thought I would.  I am glad I didn't pay for the app.
0670026638|5.0|This is a wonderful story which spans two different countries, Japan and Canada.  One enters into a deep connection not only with people across the ocean, but across time.  I loved the Japanese language, the footnotes, the expressions which peppered the conversations.  I especially liked the zen explanations.<br />Each of the characters was memorable.<br />I just had to continue reading.<br />Annette Debs
B006TVQTHW|5.0|This case has amazing airflow, the optional fan behind the motherboard sockett is a feature that gives this case outstanding value and cooling. Other case manufacture's should take notice. I have purchased 2 of these for current builds, and I must say I will countiue to purchase this Antec case because it is so important to keep the motherboard as cool as possible for extending the life of it and the CPU. I have built 10 gaming rigs using other Antec and Corsair cases, But for the money, this 1 is the best so far!
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|great product. loved this movie. One of the cutest movies i have ever seen. recommend this movie to everyone, secially one going through a break up
0500516766|5.0|What: This is my first ever Amazon Review.<br /><br />Why: I purchased this book because I don't believe 20x200 is coming back online any time soon and I needed some Todd McLellan in my life. His work is wonderful, so I suggest you get his book too - and maybe a second one for a friend that you really like.<br /><br />Where: This book lives open on a vintage shop desk in my house. Every couple of days I turn the page to enjoy another creative composition. It's a bound work of art - so it deserves to be displayed and not shelved.<br /><br />Who: You will like this book too if you enjoy picture books, tinkering, sculpture, science fairs, art, photography, the creative process or are old enough to identify most of the products photographed.<br /><br />How:  Since I am an adult, I bought this book on amazon with my own money.<br /><br />When: I pre-ordered this book because I knew it would be awesome, and I was right. Seriously - buy it now - what are you waiting for?
B00632HWOG|1.0|Since downloading  yahoo mail for Android, I have not been able to open my mail. I am going to uninstall right now.
0486450066|5.0|Do yourself a favor and read (or at least skim) this classic!  His writing is beautiful in a 19th century way and, though some say that Darwin is an anti-Christian figure, I think his reverence for animals is far more Christian than the approach of those who think of their species as God's special creatures who get to do whatever they want (extinguish, mass slaughter, strip for skin or fur) with members of other species.<br /><br />Of course this book is a must-read for students of biology, ethology, evolution (or anti-evolution theory) and social history.
B00B2G2RG6|1.0|LOVE the show, but went elsewhre to watch. even premium  members are charged additional to watch . could watch on another site for FREE and saw no need to stay her and pay to watch..
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|It's because you require commentary as well.  I don't want to have an electronic record of my thoughts and impressions for general consumption.  That is why you can  stop asking me to rate shows, purchases or comment on anything ever again.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Apparently this movie is supposed to be funny in having a rude, racist, foul-mouthed character running our bossing everyone around.  I couldn't sit through it.  Don't waste your time.
0736092269|4.0|Some of the theories are not 100% correct - like you cant focus on the upper part of the chest in benchpress... but overall a good book.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|As the saying always goes the book is better than the movie.  This book is a lot better than the HBO TV series.  The second season is based of this book but during this season the HBO series starts to stray farther from the books.  I like a few of the changes but the books version is much better.<br /><br />This book in the series is about the rise of least five kings, Jofrey, Robb, Renley, Stanis, and Greyjoy, and their fight for the throne.  The `Dragon` Queen continues to try and raise an army across the ocean and the wildling build their army for their claim on the kingdom.  The story continues with the twists and turns known for the series.  I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|It used to be that you could communicate with your friends, but now there are so many commercials that it is difficult and time consuming scrolling down to find your friends.
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I know this album came out last year but here in the States its not even out yet.  This is literally the best album I have heard in a while.  Amazing sound, amazing voice, great lyrics with lots of meaning! Get it or regret it! Every song is a single!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed this game. Granted,it hasn't been very difficult but a relaxing game with a good plot is very enjoyable for me. I rarely get into a game so much that I finish it in two days,but that's been the case with this one. All I have to do now is carry out my rescue. Too bad I have errands to run. I'll definitely look forward to getting back home and finishing this off. I haven't checked yet,but I hope there's a sequel. I definitely recommend this game to all the puzzle solvers out there. Two thumbs up.
B00C8985DU|3.0|Have not dived into this well packaged if not overpriced set, BUT the Bonus DVD's Soundtrack is messed up. The SOUND, the Pitch of the audio track is exactly 1/2 step too high. It does not play fast...it SOUNDS fast. so all the songs and Pauls voice sound weird, indeed the ENTIRE audio track is OFF.. The TV soundtrack is BAD to start with and its a HUGE disappointment that this was overlooked OR done on purpose. It is VERY ANNOYING. The sound should be PRISTINE and it is not. It is terrible.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|the broadway cast album of the tony nominated show by Harvey firestein and with music written by Cyndi lauper will enthrall audiences
B009DH2PP4|5.0|Along with Northern Brewers DVD and Beer Kits it's very easy to get beer lovers to make their own brews that equals Micro Brews.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|That's a lofty title to bestow upon any film but District 9 had that exact effect on me. This film blew me away upon seeing it in the theater, as I went in with little knowledge of the plot or characters. I knew it had something to do with aliens and that was about it. The rave reviews and brilliant marketing campaign only added to the mystery and so I did what I seldom do: I went to the theater. And the experience was unforgettable.<br /><br />Viewing it multiple times at home has only increased my appreciation for the structure this movie follows. Both the humans and prawns are shown in realistic detail, with good and bad characters on both sides. There's certainly social commentary lurking beneath the surface but it never comes across as preachy or heavy-handed, making repeated viewings even more beneficial. The acting and directing are stellar and everything comes together in one complete package. This is one of the rare modern films that truly gripped me and it's restored my faith in competent and innovative filmmaking again. This is what great sci-fi, as well as great cinema, is all about.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|very funny but hard to do....it take lots of patience and have lots of point to fixe de car.i like it
B001EBV0NU|5.0|i love Tim Burton movies and this  is one of his realy fun ones . with all the alien invasion movies coming out these days you should check this one out. its got alot of stars and smart jokes & good ol fashoned groans. and of course the hero.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This was a super movie, enjoyed very much. I want to take time to comment on ONE NIGHT WITH<br />THE KING---This was worst 2 hours and struggled with the way it was presented. My rating on this movie<br />5 TRIPLE F. I have a DVD on The Bible ESTHER, it was presented very well and very easy to follow. No<br />jumping around to figure out what was going on. If they had a rating above 5 star I would give it.<br />Seems as though Hollywood dishes out anything to make money. Thanks for the older Movies.
B008BU75IQ|1.0|This book needed an editor badly. Not sure if it was proof read but huge mistakes were made, grammatical errors were made.  This by far was the worst of the three.  Starting with only time will tell then the sins of the father.
B00CFITJKW|3.0|I like a game that is an airplane / jet simulator,  but my only problem is I lag a lot and it always switches my camera view and I bate that. Sometimes its awesome but sometimes it stinks really bad and it never lets me steer the jet when it scronks up Ps.it like always scronks. So I say its OK.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My husband has large hands and has trouble getting the correct letters/numbers on any of the touch screens.  He refers to this as fat fingering.  The size of this application makes it impossible for him to fat finger.
B005K200NK|4.0|I read the book little house in the big woods. I thought the book was really good because it shows the reader how Laura Ingalls Wilder was really feeling about what was happenining. I liked the book because it was simple and how she didnt make it so complicated. I also liked the fact that the family was so close together. My favorite parts are the part when the family goes to grandma and grampas house for that big dance. My other favorite part is when the cousins came over and they had fun all day. I liked how they always had fun on Christmas. This book gives alot of specific details, so I never got bored during the book. I liked in the story how pa would always play the fiddle keeping the family nice and cozy.
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|This movie is awful. I saw it in theaters and would never recommend it to anyone. I would say that it is never worth your money to buy this movie.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Something new with every episode.  I often repeat the episodes just to make sure that I didn't miss anything, since they build on each other.
B004G7UTXG|5.0|I loved it! I have seen it about 5 times and am amazed it was not much more popular.<br />It has strong tones of social justice that are misses in movies often and it paints some very interesting conflicts and world views in ways great for a conversation! Probably the best movie I've seen in a while for an intellectual debate among friends.
B0031RS4V6|5.0|As usual a great read. Lee Child just seems to get better all the time. Can't wait until the next one.
B0058W74UY|1.0|I need a flash player to play a game and this was the only one I could load.  I still can't play the game and now I get unsolicited emails from it.
B001AJ09JW|5.0|Honestly, I've loved this movie for so many years. I think I liked the dark direction and it had me hooked from the beginning scene on the boat.
1119963192|5.0|Very good book. I changed a bit my style of swimming, and obtained significant results in competitions. I recommend this book.
B004SIIBGU|3.0|I love access to ebay.  However, I cannot close the app.  Does anyone know how to get it closed?  Help appreciated.
B00004CXMW|1.0|I ordered this movie because I really wanted my six year old son to see it. Received it in the mail and it didn't work. Nothing's more AGGRAVATING than to order something, wait for it, then it doesn't work! Not worth the headache of trucking down to UPS to send back talking exchange BLAH! So disappointing!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing ending. Great story. One of the best series of our generations. Love the hunger games. Best trilogy ever made.
B001JIFYSA|4.0|It's a good movie; well-acted, worth watching, with some great one-liners.  It has 4 or 5 different story threads (which are mostly character developments) that very loosely connect at the end of the movie, so you have to like that kind of movie to enjoy it.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Lean In is a book that advocates equality for women in the workplace.  Ms. Sandberg, a top executive at Facebook, filled this book with heartfelt pleas for women \\"to take their seat at the [conference] table\\".  She also offers practical tips for how women can avoid workplace no-nos and sure career killers such as asking every successful woman they meet to be their mentor right after being introduced or quitting a job due to burn out while having weeks of unused vacation time.<br /><br />This book is well-written and very readable, but I didn't think that many of Ms. Sandberg's arguments were practical for the average working woman.  Her rise to the top of the corporate ladder relied heavily on connections that she made at Harvard Business school as well as a spouse who was willing to give up his career goals in order to help raise their children and run the household.  Everyday people or single mothers don't necessarily have all of the options that Ms. Sandberg does.<br /><br />Nannies and other household help also figure into the picture for her, and she advocates that women who are still at the beginning of their careers should be willing to pay for whatever childcare they need in order to continue working full time, even if the cost of childcare exceeds their salaries.  Unfortunately, not every household can afford to take out loans to cover the cost of childcare in the hopes that Mom's career will take off and she will become a CEO.<br /><br />I really appreciated Ms. Sandberg's genuine commitment to advocating for equal opportunities for women, but for the average woman working at the average \\"dead-end\\" job, many of her tips for success may not apply.
B00BV1P8NG|3.0|These are really cute figures and wonderful to find the ponies who aren't made readily by Hasbro, but--in my opinion--they are worth maybe $6. We have Derpy, Dr. Whooves and Rainbow Dash. I'm really surprised at their quality--given they are made by Funko and Funko usuallys does a decent job with its figures.<br /><br />First, these ponies have very realistic-looking molds and are quite cute and well-painted (thumbs up to that). They are also a good size (almost as big as the Fashion MLPs). However, they have quality issues. First, some of their joints are poorly glued together (neck/head and tail). The paint also scratches easily--fine for display, but not good for play. I will be trying to seal the painted parts of ours soon with a good air-dry vinyl varnish I bought from Bountiful Babies (a fantastic doll supply company) in hopes to preserve the paint as my daughter likes to play with them.<br /><br />Another important thing to take note of is the vinyl smells really, really bad. How bad? Stronger and a load more chemical-laden than a Berenguer doll (if you are a parent or doll collector who bought one of these dolls you'll know what I mean). The smell literally comes out of the box and smacks you upside of the head.<br /><br />If you really want to buy one for a child or someone who is sensitive to smells (or you are just plain concerned about toxins), be sure to set the pony out of the box for a couple weeks so it offgasses or a day or two outside. Not sure if they are BPA or lead-free. It make not be as important as they seem more suited to be display figures, but it'd be great to know--especially if kids have access to them.
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Its just awesome.  I love the new sounding music and lyrics.  The Phoenix is probably the best song on the album.  I've been waiting for this and they didn't fail me!
B004A8ZX28|4.0|The plot is completely predictable, but Liam Neeson does a good job keeping the story moving. The foreign locales are completely reasonable and integrated  nicely.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Great game. Time killer. A must get. Have had lots of fun playing. I even get yelled at by my girlfriend for playing so much. Keep up the good work.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|A great read indeed. This story touches every emotion. Coming to grips with life can be hard and this story captivates the emotions of having lived a life with joy and sadness. I must admit that the last few chapters had me crying like a baby!
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Watching this movie will change your baseball managerial/coach perspective. There are still teams unwilling to use the brilliant statistical minds to enhance the game. This movie helps the baseball fan understand the beauty and blend of intuition and statistical analysis.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Out of all the 3D films that I have purchased for my 3D TV, this is by far the best one that I have seen! Blew me away!
B008476HBM|5.0|This is an absolute classic and was a joy to read. I love all of Jane Austen's novels, but this one might now be my favorite.
B005Q4CM0Q|4.0|It's always nice to see the little guy come out on top. Nice plot twists and transformation from disappointment to heroism.
B00COGY2P2|4.0|I consider this to be a &#34;guy&#34; movie. Lots of shooting, complete with a decent car chase (no one will ever equal the car chase in the classic movie &#34;Bullet&#34;). A lot of violence, but surprisingly clean language-wise. I counted only one F-bomb in the whole thing. I like the &#34;defender of justice&#34; genre. We need more heros, even if they're rather dark heros like Jack Reacher.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|now I have to see the movie as the book keept me involved until I was done.  Glad it was available
B005LAIGW8|4.0|Great motorcycle stunts but didn't care for foreign filming location. The plot thickens but supporting actors were kind of weak.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read this book in one day. Hard to put down.  Funny and intelligently written.  Very interesting from the male point of view.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I expected there to be jokes which of course there are. But I thought the way she handled getting across important messages was elegantly done. I also enjoyed the fact I could relate to her and the stories she told. Very down to earth and of course hilarious.
1932100660|4.0|I had studied the first small booklet on this subject in the late around 1999 when I took vegetarian cooking classes.<br />I was very pleased with this book because it is the whole study.  To say the least it is a tremendous body of work.<br />Anyone who reads this study will come away armed with the information that just might save their life.<br />It is sobering to think of how people who lived in China and follow a certain diet then come to north America and ruin their health with our &#34;North American Diet&#34;,
B00BF123WG|3.0|The dramatization was excellent but unless you know the story already the movie loses something. Worth seeing for the basic history of the hunt for UBL.
B0095P33IW|4.0|Nice way to introduce many new generations to Cap and his virtues! Good role model and of course the iconic shield is pretty sweet!
B003R0LBVW|5.0|Complex characters that pull you in  and keep you reading and thinking. Carefully woven in is a commentary on the environment and American culture. Enjoyed every page.
1847879071|5.0|This book had lots of interesting situations to help the reader learn a difficult subject - statistics!  It made the class much easier to &#34;get&#34;.
B003U4ZOQ8|2.0|This is my least favorite season of Lost. The show seems to lose its way here with too much running around, guns, and explosions. The character development, depth, and intimacy of the first 3 seasons is completely gone. It is like watching an action movie for an entire season.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Loved this book. Quick read, interesting story line, and a few twists at the end that made it surprising and great. Definitely recommend this one!
B00BQ1D7X4|1.0|I recently listened to my friends copy of this album and unlike the positive other reviews put on it its no where close to albums like Jar of Flies ! Its more proof that the grunge genre has long since faded into music history ! Save your money !
B003U4UNPK|4.0|This season is on par with Season 1 & 2. Characters deepen and new characters (the Others) are introduced. I thought it was entertaining.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I really like the options that this app gives.  It would be worth it if a paid for it, even better that it is FREE!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|great time waster. for some reason the first time I downloaded it, it stopped working after I beat a couple objectives.
B0095VPAVE|5.0|I've had this for a few months and do LC and BC mining. For LC, it can do 32-36MH if all cores are used, along with BC mining (which uses very little CPU power). Works great!
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|I did have trouble several times however with buffering time. It took several minutes of the show to catch up.  I was pretty disappointed with that.
B000SEGEKI|1.0|This book has no actual programming content and is a \\"literary\\" collection of fatuous slogans and stories. Most of the items are like Polonian advicetoids (\\"Never a borrower nor lender be\\", etc) that have no real practical application. When I was a kid and read Hamlet I thought Polonius' advice sounded really wise and useful, then somebody pointed out to me what a sniveling and conniving coward Polonius was, and how his advice was just a bunch of vain words that didn't prevent Hamlet from skewering him with a sword. This guy's book is pretty much the same thing, a bunch of fancy anecdotes that do not amount to anything, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing (to quote Shakespeare). The author himself even evokes Shakespeare in the book (\\"When we strive, oft we mar what's well\\"), ironically quoting the Duke of Albany, a fatuous and wishy-washy weakling that the evil forces in the play end up situating on the throne. That pretty much sums up the usefulness of this book.
B0007TKNII|5.0|If you've seen Phantom on Broadway, this version has some really great aspects that help to clarify the story.  I especially liked the use of black and white at the beginning and end to show differences in time periods.  The music is stunning!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Took a long time to get to the point.  Movie is slow in places and the bad language is excessive.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Before i bought the movie i had read about this being a true story. I just find it very interesting true life event.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|Grease with Travolta is too fun to watch.  With his other projects, it is seeing a totally different part of his acting career.  The show itself is a little cliche at times, but the music is so good you can't complain too loudly.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I love this season. Ever since i watched the pilot i loved it. In my opinion \\"Glee\\" season 1 is the best!
B00CWM3F4C|4.0|There are only two real stand outs that truly make me feel like I am listening to Alice and that is Hollow and Stone. The riffs, the layers, the vocals, the in your face symphony of noise that provide the total package and reminds me why I love Alice so much. Honorary mentions go to Phantom Limb, Hung On A Hook, and The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here. The rest sounds too much like Jerry's solo work, I kept hearing Degradation Trip in the songs (which isn't a bad thing, but not what I was really hoping for with this album).<br /><br />Hard core Alice fans probably won't like it, but do yourself a favor and just leave your expectations at the door and appreciate it for what it is, a really great rock album.<br /><br />And Jerry, what the hell is up with the hair do? You look like Ellen DeGeneres!
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Shown on a bigger screen helps this DVD become more effective.  The second CD included offers interesting facts about production and gives information not commonly known.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is thrilling! I am a Percy Jackson fan as well as Harry Potter. Harry Potter is my favorite book of all time but I still do love this book very much and I cannot deny it.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|get this cd it is her best all the great songs she is the voive of the 21th century her music is so universal and uplifting can,t wait fora new album to come out!
B0000AM6IY|5.0|The quality is very good and the production demonstrates why the show won 8 Academy Awards.  Easy to use the menu and find the exact scenes you want when you just have to hear a song more than once!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 9 year old grandson is visiting and playing Minecraft which we ordered for my Kindle.  He said to give it the top rating.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was a good story but the book itself  was soooooooo very super duper boring<br />Otherwise was really good
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|Keep up the good work. I listen all the time. I'm a Truck Driver, I pick my favorite channels and I don't have to worry about what I'm going to listen to while riding down the road.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I like the game but if the game is free you should be able to play the hole game a d not have you start the game and then want you to pay for the rest.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love it I would recommend this game to anyone. My friend's love it too now that I told them about it
B0050DIWFC|5.0|To be honest with you I have not read a book in over 20 years. I have poor concentration. I downloaded defending Jacob because it was on the best reading list and it sounded so interesting. I also thought that if I download the audible it may just get me through it.  It did for a day. I was so excited the next morning that I could actually read a book again... I woke up and started again.  The audible did not work and I read it anyway.  The story of the book intrigued me my head is still spinning from the way it all ended.  This is a book I need to think about for while.  I started it yesterday and finished it today. So much to do with us as human beings .
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|It is very colorful, but I can't find much to do with it.  We do not play it very much.
B006LSZECO|2.0|this book did not worth the money that I paid the price should be $1 not a good writing and the story did no have a conclousion
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A nail biting journey of suspense that leaves you in wonder at the complex challenges faced.  It would be hard to believe season 4 can keep the pace up!
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|The whole movie consists of brief, incoherent clips of the same actors, many of them with badly applied plaster on their faces, playing different characters on different times and places, who are supposedly related to each other in some incomprehensible way. One ends up suspecting that this is also incomprehensible to the directors and scriptwriters, hence their inability to explain it.<br />Too many of the clips are grotesque and ridiculous. Some of them clearly intend to be humorous, such as for example some extended and unbearable scenes of a group of elderly people, but they are just boring and badly made. It is just amazing to see how  very talented actors like Jim Broadbent and Hugo Weaving can be utterly wasted in this clumsy film.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I'm relatively new to TGW, catching up on Amazon's awesome HD.  It is really a well-plotted show, with a &#34;case of the week&#34; as well as some storylines which continue throughout the season.  Sex scandals, contrition and questions about its sincerity, and office in-fighting are all over the season, as well as the tale of impossible love between our hero, Alicia, and her old flame-current boss Will. (though, honestly, the guy is a great actor but I can't imagine passing up Chris Noth for him.).  The legal aspects of the cases are a little weaker this season; with all manner of improbable issues cropping up and being resolved in a matter of &#34;hours&#34; on the show.<br />Still, one of the better made network shows; very well-acted and produced.  Well worth your time.
B005C8ENI0|4.0|This was the best the-lawyer-you-love-to-hate movie I remember seeing. Matthew McConaughey is spot-on in the leading role. There was an unexpected twist near the end that made it all worth the watching. Check it out.
B003G8Y4QO|4.0|Ive been a fan of Doctor Who since some of the 'Classic' era, and the new versions have really revived my interest in the show.  When Tennant left, I was worried that it would all fall apart due to how much of a strong personality he had.  While I will admit Matt Smith is not as bad as I was worried he would be (why I actually stopped watching the show for a season and a half), he still just does not seem to have that utter charisma and charm that the 10th Doctor had. While the overarching storyline for season 5 reminded me a lot of the 'Bad Wolf' theme from Tennants stretch, I wont spoil what happens, but it was not as enjoyable and emotional as the 'End of Time' conclusion to the arch was to me.  I do enjoy some of the attitude of the 11th Doctor however, who is not afraid to look some aliens in the eye and tell them who he is and why they should back off and run away, and perhaps he will grow on me more as I go through Seasons 6 and 7.
0141345659|5.0|I bought this product for someone else - I received it as promised and expected in excellent condition beyond that I cannot speak to the product
B00CL68BK2|4.0|Kept me interested throughout.  The Academy awards were deserved.  Jennifer Lawrence will be around as a star for some time to come.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|It's something for me to read just for fun when I want to relax from all the stress of college at night, but it's absorbing and a quick, easy read. I can't wait to hear more of the story!
140053271X|5.0|Bought for my wife and she enjoyed the ease of use including touch response. battery life and built-in dictionary.<br />Only disappointment was inability to delete books from Nook unless connected to computer. Overall very satisfied.
B00B97TMIE|5.0|Saw the youtube video for Radioactive on a favorite author's facebook fan page and was instantly hooked. The video made me laugh and the music was just addictive. I bought the deluxe download because I can't get enough of all the songs on the album. I have been playing it almost non-stop since I bought it.
B0091W7K6K|3.0|I picked this movie to watch based on the number of good reviews. What a disappointment. Slow moving, with a lot of 'looking' at each other. I'm sorry, with this good a cast, I expected more.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very mind challenging &amp; enjoy the freedom of being creative. Will be playing this game for a long time. Very hard to quit playing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys legal and political drama. Lots of great character development and so many nuances, it really keeps you intrigued and glued to the screen.  I can't get enough of this show!
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great way to pass the time while waiting around for something. This is also very addictive. For the kindle this game is very fun and and I would recommend to anyone of all ages.
0439023491|4.0|This was a very good read!  I read &#34;Hunger Games&#34; and watched the movie and loved both.  Of course this one is not quite as good, but enjoyable, especially if you got &#34;involved&#34; with the characters in the Hunger Games.  Recommended!
B00957T6X6|5.0|Ice and Fire is the first truly complete job of world building I have read since I left Middle Earth. The detail is stunning, the characters unique and human, and the story line gripping. If George has taught me anything, it is not to become attached to a favorite player... he slaughters them with glee. I can't wait for the conclusion of this tale,because even after five books I can't imagine how the story will end!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Was working great until i had momentary sound cut outs and after the receiver was replaced i was relieved of that issue. However, after that a new issue arose with static popping sounds and other players would hear this sounds. After few weeks of troubleshooting with logitech i was able to get a replacement headset and was newer looking model. I just happened to get the bad batch but i know another gamer who does not have any issues with his model and works perfectly.
B000OP1M6M|5.0|This is my first automatic watch purchase and I'm very happy with it. I don't think you can do any better at this price point. Probably even if you spend $100 more. Fit and finish is excellent and it keeps time perfectly.
B004XMMSZG|1.0|This product is poorly packaged and there is no real support on the website ... Read the reviews and you will be well informed. This product is the definition of product failure ... Don't recommend this to anyone... I don't write reviews but this is a protection review to guard the smart ones who read these.. Now if I save you from making the mistake  I did at least I'll feel better!<br />Jp
B00008438V|4.0|If you like the 80's teen movies(Breakfast Club,Sixteen Candles,etc) you'll like this one.  Teen hijinks with a little magic and a sexy female lead-it also has the &#34;life-lesson&#34; for us all.  Look for a young Robert Downey Jr.-he's great!  Don't miss this one!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|You can find everything here. You will get ideas for stuff you didn't even know you were looking for. Just remember to get off and go to bed. lol.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|So extremely helpful! You can make a checklist or a just a simple note...and also when u slide the screen its a calender and u can add important dates and appointments on there....if u need an app to keep track this app is for u
B004GJDQT8|2.0|Well I 'm currently in Costa Rica and unfortunatelly we cant acess prime videos either. Some day soon I hope this situation can be remedy.Thanks.
B0081JFGQU|3.0|While I enjoyed most of the songs, some of the jams continued way too long, to the point of boredom.  I much preferred their &#34;Revelator&#34; album.
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|Rod Stewart is still my favorite singer of all time. So happy to have a new album by him!  His music is timeless.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|After hearing a couple of songs on Pandora, I decided to buy the album.  I really liked it and have listened to it often over the past couple of weeks.
B004SBS8LA|3.0|To me its better than the original. The UI and mixed colors just look better to me. But the series is getting stale. The Star Wars version is a step up from this.
B002P79KAC|5.0|Funny for the whole family, we can all sit around and watch this and laugh at a range of humor styles.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|How can anything Holmes be bad. This is a great collection and one I am happy to have. Hours of reading and kindle is the way to keep it neat. Well done.
B008Y1YK9Y|1.0|it jammed dvd player ,when I finally got it from the player it was cracked. this was the very first used dvd I purchased.  once is enough for me.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I had been thinking of a movie and ordered this one instead. At first was disappointed that I got it wrong, but watched this all the way thru and really liked it. Nice surprise and gives one a lot to think about.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|The images were too small.  When enlargine the tiles, had to move all over the screen to find a match.  Sorry, I deleted it from my Kindle.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was going to go with a cheaper charger and cable but decided to get this one which is made for the Kindle since I plan on having it for some years.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|I am a big POTO fan, but love this more! I think Ben Lewis does an AWESOME job. I would say and Webber fan needs to watch!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I've found that in my area the AccuWeather app's often 5-10 degrees different from other temp apps and outside thermometers. Annoying 'cause I already know when it's hot or cold and what I'm  looking for is accuracy - not some vague &quot;it's in the 80s&quot; estimate. However its easy to use and monitor. The forecasts seem as accurate as the local TV weather.
B00C4YZ12C|4.0|pretty good game.  not so hard you can not win but not so easy that you beat it every time.
B00CABLXU8|5.0|Even though it's a product review, but I am also going to talk about Little Mix. So I have been a fan of Little Mix since August of 2012. I already knew all of the songs because I listened to them on YouTube. I am so excited that their album is finally released in America. I got the album the day that it was released, which was May 28th. The whole album is amazing! Perrie, Jade, Jesy, and Leigh-Anne are great singers. Their voices and their harmonies are amazing! I think that the girls are great role models for any girl at any age. I think Little Mix will be as big as One Direction.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|While the first several chapters are a bit adolescent, it picks up nicely and makes for good escape reading.  Shifting settings bring a variety of perspectives to ethical dilemmas - provokes a bit of thought along with entertainment.  Would make an excellent vacation choice.
B001K3EXTA|5.0|what can you sat about Robert Redford, this was great it was my first time watching it, I read the book then had to see the movie, sad but life must go on
B00475AYJQ|4.0|A good read - especially for this genre.  Characters have some depth, plot is complex and intriguing.  Women are more than two dimensional.
B0014DQSG2|5.0|down to earth movie, feel good!!! if you are feeling down this is a good movie to watch it will pick you up
B00447G29S|5.0|One of those movies you can watch over and over.  Is definitely a Christmas staple in our house that we look forward to watching each year.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|what cn I say, I feel this is the best addition that they have came out with yet, wonderful movie, love the additional footage
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|Albeit one depressing situation it is one of those stories/books that keeps your attention and is a testament to human's desire to survive.
0345803485|1.0|In short order the adventures became boring and I kept hoping this stupid girl would wise up and not imperil her body or mind with this wacko.  Money and power are not everything.  Respect, consideration, kindness are much more important--of course, that would not have made a tittillating best seller.<br /><br />This is a sad commentary on the values of our country.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This is not exactly a book meant to heighten IQ but it's good, mindless entertainment. I read it as a selection made in my book club. I was able to finish it in 3 nights because it is a super easy read. I thought it was a little pricey (even the Kindle edition) but was too lazy to go to a used book store to find a copy. Anyone who wants a mental escape and likes romance novels will probably enjoy this.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|it is good not great<br />still getting introduced to new characters i don't care about<br />same stuff as the other books but i am too invested
B003YL4KS0|4.0|My 'old' curly hair had gotten so out of control and I just didn't know what to do.  Now I do. And I'm getting compliments about my hair again.  This book was just what my hair needed.
B003O86FMW|4.0|The book got a little long, but i guess they had to fill the space some how.  The ending was good and i felt it tied it all together.  It will probably make for a good movie with all the action sequences.
B00BKRON5K|5.0|Great book.  Very informative.  I have recommended it to all of my friends and family.  If only more people would follow this way of eating and living, we would have a healthier world.  thank you Dr. Cordain.
0062082353|5.0|Great story, literally could not put the book down once I started reading. Read more than 1/2 of the book the first sitting. The story is awesome, told an excellent way by authors.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|I liked the price which was $10 less than Target. Got 3D to play on the PS3 and DVD my child can play on his player OK n his room
B00846REIS|5.0|Very comparable to the Shades of Grey novels, however, without the submissiveness.  Loved the book, can't wait to continue the story.
B009R659L8|3.0|This is a good read, but not one of Ms. Clark's best.  The conclusion is a bit cliched involving twin brothers.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The story line contiues to be really good.  keeps your attention, and throws in a twist or two.  On to the next, I hope it doesn't disappoint.
B0094K1K42|1.0|The previews looked pretty funny, however this movie is awful. The first 20 mins I was ready to claw my eyes out waiting for something to happen. So glad I didnt have to pay to see it.
B000FC2ROU|5.0|Read this book 3 times and found it deeply touching.  The fictional characters are so real that you<br />come to feel that you know them.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|Not as interesting as I thought. I don't care for the index and flipping back and forth. I couldn't identify with the characters. Parts of certain stories where good.
B001D0DQUC|5.0|Watched it with my 11 year old because she is interested in film making and this was a movie that a prospective high school considered a classic.  It was enjoyable for both of us and didnt seem out of date.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The app doesn't work unless you go to the browser & have it loaded every time you visit it sucks.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I was tearing throughout the story. It was very very touching and sad and I am thankful for what I have
B00821OX98|5.0|I have to admit I am addicted to this show! My husband and i watched both seasons in less then a week.  Great characters, amazing storylines, and wonderful actors! Highly recommended!!
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I fell in love with Fringe midway through it-and was excited to see I can watch the entire series here on Amazon! I'm totally addicted to seeing all the seasons I missed and know I'll be sad when I catch up to where I started and then when it ends all over again.
0689835604|5.0|My 16 month old daughter loves this book.  The flaps are big and easy for her to put her fingers under and lift up to reveal the picture underneath.  Very cute and enjoyable.
B006LSZECO|2.0|*****SPOILERS INCLUDED*******<br />I read this book based on a friends suggestion. She loved it. It took me a few chapters to really get into it but once I did, I though to myself 'wow, what a wonderfully written book' - 'what great twists and turns'. Then, BOOM, the ending just sucked. I agree with another poster of a review - the ending just ruined all the good stuff I had read up to that point. There were not one character that I could find myself liking. I could get over that but Amy was truly evil and detestable. I just find it incredibly hard to believe that the Nick that was built up in this story would stay with her. I am by no means a writer but I would have done the ending so entirely differently - I would never have ended it with such a fizzle. I hate that I spent my money on this. Thoroughly disappointed.
B000001FKY|5.0|This is a very good CD from my days. It's a little less metal than some of the previous albums, but I still love it. This is Rick Allen's first CD as a drummer w/ only one arm. Impressive in my opinion. I recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|i loved the action in this book it was it kept me on the edge wondering who the bad peron was
B006LSZECO|4.0|This story can't be summarized as a \\"who done it?\\" This is a complete and total mind game until the very end. As you get to know both protagonists/antagonists- it's hard to tell which is which, you are given insights on how Nick and Amy differ and how they're the same. Each chapter has you so sure until you begin the next one. The characters and plot are well thought out and come to life immediately. An absolute page turner. So much so that I truly continued to turn the page hoping for just one more sentence.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|loved book and dont haveanything else to say  the book was quite explicet but intresting lookng forward to the movie
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I love this game it not hard to get into and its fun to play gold could be easier to get.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|at first i wasn't going to order the second book but the ending of the first was so good had to read the second one and by then i was hooked on the love story
B0053FANS6|4.0|Blu-Ray quality is great, sound is great.  It works with all three of my Blu-Ray players.  The product itself is everything I could possibly expect.  I'm very bummed that the Scorpion King wasn't included.  I guess it's my fault for not looking.  My DVD version of the Mummy Trilogy that I bought a few years back has the Scorpion King instead of the Dragon Emperor... so I just assumed the Blu-Ray copy would be the same.  Oh well.
B00BC5I6Q2|4.0|another working title for the series could have been 'Mixed Bag' I can't imagine anything more enjoyable or productive than being the writer or producer of this show and sitting down to read the viewers' reviews so here's mine:<br /><br />first and foremost entertaining. I went through the entire season in 2 days and had as much fun as I did during my Mad Men marathon. Kevin Spacey's got more bite than Don Draper and his entire crew put together and there's no period wardrobes to distract from the story. about the story, what the heck happened? a script equivalent of a roller coaster ride by the end I was dizzy. it seems that establishing the arc of all the characters and building it up was way more sound than unleashing everyone into the aftermath. I don't like what the writers did but would rather not point to specifics for fear of spoiling the plot for others. by the last episode it seemed all over the place even as the characters are all patting themselves on the back for tying it all together nicely. this makes me appreciate the art and craft of a long standing series such as The Sopranos which never felt forced despite the heavy handed violence and endless assortment of pasta. indeed, Congressman Frank Underwood seems to have a Mafia complex, except that real mobsters or even made up ones don't stare into the camera smugly and talk to the viewer one on one. a clever mechanism that distinguishes the show for having its own shtick.<br /><br />this show has a lot of potential and I certainly believe it's a clear nod to Glenn Close's character and the show she stars in. ruthless powerful female characters are far more intriguing than male ones but the creators have gone great lengths to challenge that notion. there is so much room for Kevin Spacey's character to stretch out I just hope they pace themselves; you don't have to build an elaborate coaster to take us for a ride.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I bought this a few months ago, and finally got around to using it. The end that goes into the auto's cigarette lighter is too big in diameter and BARELY fits. It is so tight that I am afraid to use it, for fear it will pull out the internal components of the cigarette lighter. This is true for all 3 cigarette lighter outlets on my 2006 Dodge Truck, as well as all 3 cigarette lighter outlets on my 2012  Hyundai (I tried it on all 6 outlets with the same result - I can barely get it in, and when pulling it out so hard, afraid it will damage the cigarette lighter). Forget what I paid for it or when, but is going in goodwill because its probably too old to return.<br /><br />Anyone else have this particular problem?
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Its kind of a western throw back movie.  Lots of fun and a gritty.  Typical of Terintino movie is lots of blood splater, but I expect that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Help me this game is too awesome to play every day.To much awesome not enough days in the year! ;-)
B0088W4YTK|5.0|Only 2nd to Stargate SG1. Very entertaining and appropriate for some older kids. I wish there were more seasons.love love love it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|very inventive book, old style &#34;gladiator type warfare&#34; and yet futuristic -- I thought if wars could be fought with only one or two representing the country it would be better and not kill all our young men off.
B008OM0EDO|3.0|On a night lacking other entertainment we chose this knowing that Sasha Baren Cohens humor is not for the light at heart. Althought Dictator is a step lighter in profanity over Borat, the movie gets its humor from highly racial stereotypes. Some parts were truly comical and we did make it through the film unlike Borat which we turned off mid-stream. If you go into it with the right expectations, you can get a laugh but its not a movie that requires tons of focus or deserves much attention.
B0029LCJJS|4.0|probably how it really was, no rules.  I thought the actor playing King Henry is just right, I am anxious to see how he evolves.
B001ANYDAO|3.0|Well written. But the chapters (at least the first few) are very long and repeat<br />Five. I found myself wondering if the book would change at all.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The actors are so good, I even feel sorry for the bad ones.  It leads you along and then a surprise happens that just shocks.
B00BYISQTO|5.0|The first listen didn't really hook me, but now I can see this is probably their best album yet after a few listens.  I now actually think its more consistently good than the brilliant \\"High Violet.\\"  What makes it even cooler is that this is a 4AD record!!!!
B004SN8Z5M|3.0|If you get this shoe, I would suggest ordering it 0.5 size up from what you normally wear. The length is fine, but it is far too tight (a common theme with this shoe apparently and with other minimalist shoes).<br /><br />I am disappointed that they didn't work out for me because the grip on them is phenomenal and they otherwise fit very well and would likely perform excellently.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|It was a nice easy story to read but not great, and for some reason I thought it was going to be a true story about someone living a kind of recluse lifestyle but it wasn't so I was little dussapointed
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I've seen this before and now it's nice to own my own copy... would highly recommend it to all who appreciate good cinema...
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Good book - makes you wonder just what life was like for the females in this time period and glad to live in the USA!
B004U7MQWE|5.0|Shakespeare In Love is my all time favorite movie and getting Emma along with it is a bonus... don't miss either...
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Still reading the series  - finding it very interesting!  Lots of people to keep track of but written so it's possible.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|I couldn't get through the movie and turned it off before the halfway mark. I usually like animation, but I didn't like the look of the characters or the plot.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|This is more of a &#34;what if&#34; movie rather than the traditional Star trek movie.... But Still a Great Flick and one of my top 5
B003DS3GC0|5.0|A great movie with an all star cast. I love Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Robert DeNiro and Dustin Hoffman.  Great acting and the story was  riveting.  I don't think I ever paused the movie once.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Muse has rock my house for years they just make great music I post it up on fb and twitter YouTube and the link ware to buy

B005LHOKFS|5.0|I downloaded Tripadvisor before going on vacation.  I have not only used this site but also contributed to it...I have put at least 6 evaluations on Tripadvisor. It is helpful to weed out the the really bad options from the OK ones.  As with all evaluations you need to look at the really bad ones and see if it is reasonable and the comments fit.<br />The site is easy to use for all over the USA and abroad.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I couldn't but game down ! Each chapter was different, but tied together. The clues were very helpful. I would play again.
1609613937|5.0|I read the Starch Solution in its entirety and have continued to go back to re-read sections since switching to a vegan, plant-based diet low in oil/fat two months ago. I will never go back to eating dairy or meat again!! I do occasionally slip up (usually with yummy homemade baked goods others have made) but have made an extremely drastic diet change and have convinced my athletic husband to try it to! I feel good and have lost a little weight (I continue to eat nuts and some oil while getting used to the diet but plan to limit that strictly now that I'm on the right path). I need to loose 20 lbs I put on after my second child and also learned that I have a genetic predisposition to blood-clotting disorder, so I have definite motivation to keep it up and stay healthy and lean for life!  I found that this book helped me get started and then finding vegan cookbooks (happy herbivore!!) and the engine 2 diet blog to keep me motivated and for easy recipes. The plant-based lifestyle is growing in popularity because of books like this that really help to teach true heathy eating habits and to move away for the Standard American Diet. It's also convincing when you consider the industries behind meat, dairy, and eggs- definitely not with the best interest of the general population in mind! The chapter on dairy industry is really what got to me!!  I am also happy to share that I spend the same or less on groceries-meat and dairy are just as expensive as fresh and frozen veggies, beans, and grains, so don't let that thinking deter you (there are a lot of blogs about cooking vegan on a budget, too). It's hard to ignore the benefits of eating truly natural, less processed foods and I hope more people join this heathy lifestyle, even if they take the transition slowly.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|BTD5 is probably the best balloons tower game ever. I love it!! Best game ever. Recommend to anyone. Love it
B0045I3EJC|4.0|The DVD arrived on time<br /><br />It complies with the description in the listing: NEW.<br /><br />I like to negotiate with you.<br /><br />I recommend you.<br /><br />  Thank you,
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game. It was  on my dad's iPhone and when he got it I played it for hours and hours. I was disappointed when it wasn't on the Amazon app store. But when I came out it was great
0780622553|5.0|The DVD arrived very fast<br /><br />It complies with the description in the listing: NEW.<br /><br />I like to negotiate with you.<br /><br />I recommend you.<br /><br />  Thank you,
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I just bought this app and i love it because you can adjust it how loud you want it, and it has so many sound selections, and they're all great quality. But my only complaint is that I don't see a timer anywhere? I don't know if it's my kindle or the app, but I would like this problem to be solved.
B005LAII8K|4.0|What I understood about the movie before watching it is only a sliver of what the movie is about. It's rare to come across a movie with a twist in the plot like this one managed to pull off. Also, it seems there is no role that JGL can't fill in convincing and skillful fashion. His nuanced execution of a young Bruce Willis is ironic in that Willis can really only play himself, while Levitt can play anyone. If you were on the fence about seeing this movie, see it.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I had fun reading this book, it was hard to put down.  The ending of this book was very disapointing, as if the writer had nothing more to say. I would have given it more stars if the ending had been less lazy.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Very interesting book to read n reread when needed. Explained very easily and has also helped me in time of need
B001NA6096|5.0|Captures the awkward, inwardly exciting time of falling in love. Nothing happens but two people talking, and that is the beauty of the movie.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This exceeded expectations.  The workout is VERY challenging and burns lots of calories.  The purchase was a good bargain and a nice addition to my workout routine.
B008Y73940|4.0|Love Matthew.  He is always fun to watch.  Great Movie.  I do not have time to write the required words for the rest of the review.  You shouldn't have to be required to write all small essay.  It should be easy and fun to give feedback.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I am a weather watcher so it is wonderful having The Weather Channel on my Kindle Fire -- always able to check the forecast.
B0096HIEE2|4.0|So, I'll put in my two cents here amongst the nearly thousands of reviews. I might be the last person to watch this movie because it is so far out of my preferred genre, if it hadn't been as popular as it was was and if I weren't as bored as I am, I never would have watched it. After reading the reviews, I expected a brain dead piece of nonsense with no character growth and a lot of naked men.<br /><br />Imagine my surprise to find this movie completely absorbing, not because of the naked men (not that I didn't appreciate the great dancing and parts of the show!), and certainly not because of the casual sex. Having never been a fan of Channing Tatum, I found his character interesting, engrossing, and the focal point of this movie. I must have read, out of 25 or so reviews before I wrote this, at least 10 reviewers who found absolutely no redemption in this movie. I had to wonder if we saw the same movie! Mike's (Channing Tatum) struggle with the useless, empty life he was leading, in my opinion, had been going on for some time before the beginning of the movie. When he meets Adam, a shy 19 year old sort of drifter, and Adam's sister Brooke, who loves her brother dearly and obviously is a bit of a parent figure to him, the real plot begins to come together.<br /><br />This movie isn't a movie that edifies the lifestyle of the men who choose it at all. In fact, if you watch carefully, as I have learned to do in all Steven Soderbergh's movies, you watch a subtle transition occur in one or more characters. Perhaps subtlety isn't best in a movie full of nudity and sex! However, as Adam becomes more and more absorbed in what Soderbergh clearly meant to convey is a very degenerate lifestyle, Mike, watches him as if he is reliving his own experiences with this lifestyle. I would have liked more closure between Brooke and Mike in the end. It was a mistake to end it so abruptly (IMO) and almost conveyed a contrived plot device that almost misses the message he is trying to convey throughout this movie. I will say that this review comes from a person who had zero expectations of this movie, which might be why I saw different things from other people. However, having seen my share of Soderbergh movies, he is far from my favorite director. It COULD have been a much better movie! I rounded it to 4 stars, but in reality, it's a 3 and a half star movie. So, there! My two cents in a highly reviewed movie here on Amazon!nvey throughout this movie.

B003B02PF4|4.0|I think this is a great book, well written.  However, I was surprised when I came to the ending, it seemed abrupt and even incomplete.
B001XUPH9K|5.0|The is the best of all of the Star Trek TV episodes and movies.  Watch or re-watch the TV episode Space Seed then watch Khan, once again, put James T. Kirk into a Kobayashi Maru type of no win scenario.  This time Kirk couldn't cheat like he did as a cadet while fighting the superior Khan in order to save his and his crew's lives in the Mutara Nebula.
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I've been a fan of the Piano Guys a long time. When they came out with their first CD I was thrilled! Now they have a second and again, it is on my &#34;must have&#34; list! They are so talented and their music is gorgeous! Begin Again and Berlin are just two of my favorites!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|I'm so addicted to this show that I can hardly wait for the next episodes to be available on Instant Video.<br />The casting is superb. Mads Mikkelsen, Hugh Dancy & Laurence Fishburne are perfect for their characters.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|The ad is miss leading. If you want this animation to do anything you have to pay and pay for each function.<br />RIP OFF!!!!!!
B008NMT684|5.0|He is 2 and starting to enjoy puzzles. It was a little hard the first time he tried doing the puzzles but he figured it out very fast! I am so glad I decided to get this...it is one of his favorites!
B00BUVLQNI|5.0|My adult daughter requested the series for her birthday and loves it. I have never watched an episode, but concede it receives great reviews. As for the purchase, the product was delivered promptly and at a competitive price.
B008QMMEOE|5.0|My grandson loves the puzzles. He has learned the shapes very quickly! He also enjoys the reward for finishing the puzzles.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|Very fun game.  One of those Free Apps that you don't instantly uninstall after the first launch.  You can try tilt or touch controls, but tilt is pretty tough to control.
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|My grandson is 2 and loves this game! He loves building the letters and matching the pictures! It is so worth getting this game!
B00AEBB8H4|5.0|TO CATCH A THIEF is a sadly undervalued entry in the Hitchcock canon, but remains one of his keenest entertainments, thanks to a razor-sharp script and a charismatic cast. This Blu-Ray finally does the film justice, rendering its lush, elegant visual landscape with striking vibrancy and detail.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Woke my my childish heart in an instant! Never pictured the Easter Bunny in this light or Santa either...something new and fresh within the old stories of childhood.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I saw some similar thoughts with other great writers. Thank you for the suspense, the emotion and the fact. Good book!

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good read. Gives an insight into the mindset of American elite military and the conflict between their private and professional lives.
1451648537|5.0|Great book -- Interesting man. I had met him a few times but wasn't in his league so learned more about him from the book itself
B00006J3WH|5.0|I loved the buffy series but I love this cd here I play it in my car. love the characters singing in this one. wish the series was still on.
B0035JRVR8|5.0|This a great classic movie to add to your collection particularly if you like Audrey Hepburn or Gregory Peck or Eddie Albert. This was Audrey's first film and is very charming. Nominated for several Oscars, it's definitely on a list to see especially if you like some of the more lighthearted movies of this genre.
031606792X|5.0|loved reading this book to see how it all ends. kept your attention .I have read all of the books. would love to see more from the author
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|A very slow movie. The plot twist was all that the movie had going for it. It took so long to get there that when it did, it was obvious.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|They spent the entire season building up the final showdown between Rick and the Governor and boy did it disappoint. I hope I don't have to watch many more filler episodes next season to see this happen. If it's another season of fillers then I may get too frustrated to come back.<br /><br />Part of the appeal of this show from the beginning was how quickly the story progressed and how the writers did not fear killing someone off. Nobody was safe, but now I feel like they have deviated from that path since then. I find it difficult to get into a TV show in general, and this show is starting to lose its original luster and become no different than any other show on TV.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This  is an exciting series with thoughtful plots and believable characters. The law cases are timely and very interesting.<br />Worth watching
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|It was hard to believe that this family survived all of this! Highly recommend this movie, just bought it and sent to Americans living in Panama.  They are excited about getting this, as are into the rainy season.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This is a great puzzle game that my kids can play as well. Great for killing time while waiting in line  or for an appointment. Very glad I grabbed this fun game.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I have seen this twice and bought it for family and friends.  I keep coming back for more.  It should be shown in school.<br />Great Movie!
B008P1EWIM|1.0|I thought it is going to be useful and animated app. But I can get same info if I use my default weather advisor (from HTC). Nothing special.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Love their unique style.<br />Love the music.<br />Love the variety.<br />Will look forward to the next CD.<br />Amazing sound and not disapponting
B004WE01YA|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite animated Disney movies! It is even more beautiful on DVD/Blue-Ray than I remembered from the VHS that I owned when my children were young. Now I am able to share it with my granddaughter!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|surprised at the variety of styles of music.<br />Lead singer has a unique voice which is awesome to listen to
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This is another great book by a skilled author,  Even if your brain says this cannot happen, somewhere in you soul you think that just maybe it can happen.
B008NW67E0|5.0|Never disappointing!<br />Great music to listen to and sit back and just enjoy!<br />Would love to see them in person- would be a fun event!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|Great theme and love the music- too many swear words for my comfort level with my kids 12 and 8
B00B2TE7FC|5.0|The entire CD is awesome!<br />Better than I expected!<br />Love the variations of the music.<br />Easy listening, makes you smile!
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|Their survival was miraculous and wonderful. It kept me glued to the television. I totally enjoyed it and so happy they survived.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|it a great time consumer when your bored but i still a good game cteather whey it will keep you in treaged
B0090SI3ZW|3.0|This movie was something to watch on a rainy afternoon and nothing more. Not worth the purchase price. Oh well!
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Great app but save never saves. Acts like it's saving edited image but it never aactually saves<br /> This is on HTC Onex
B005LAIHY0|4.0|Despite not being an absolute sequel to any of the Alien movies, a solid understanding of the background set out there will make a significant difference in your understanding of this flick. That said, an enjoyable movie if you can suspend belief just a bit.
B00C1BUYX4|2.0|I had really been looking forward to seeing Lincoln, and the acting and production was wonderful. But it was ultimately tedious and boring, and put me to sleep.
