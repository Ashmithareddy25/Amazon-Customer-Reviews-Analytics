B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love love love love love love love love love it is so awesome I just love love subway surfer
B009UX2YAC|2.0|Everyone has heard of Temple Run,everyone loves Temple Run(including me) and a billion other people.The object of that game is to run and run and collect points and coins and other oddities to entertain yourself and run and run.Well,a lot of knock-offs have come since the making of that game:Angry Gran run,Jetpack Joyride,Temple Run Brave each having their own unique twist on a good game.But indeed most of them do fail in trying to promote their uniqueness in lack of good controls and many other reasons.Today I'm going to review one in that pile:Subway Surfers.<br /><br />Subway Surfers is Temple Run in New York,including subways,fat cops with dogs,kids with spray paint who think graffiti is cool and hip,moving trains and of course every kid has a snapback.Its an endless runiing game loaded with skips and freezes and bugs and awful controls. The developer continues to changes the scenery of game to fit the current season or holiday which gets annoying.The perks are interesting to say the least,some are nice and some leave me scratching my head why they are even in the game.<br /><br />Some may say its more challenging than temple run,I would agree with them but probably not the reason they think it is.The game has awful controls!And its kinda hard to move from train to train from railroad to railroad when my runner can do what I tell him to do.I turn my finger left to right up and down and the runner will do he opposite of what I told him to do.<br /><br />Pros:The setting was a good idea.And some of the perks.<br /><br />Cons:Controls,especially the response time of the player,took too many coins to buy things,bug skips and freezes plague this game like the swine flu.The developer trying to fit the game settings into the current holiday or season.<br /><br />Overall:I'm getting sick of these knock offs of the oringinal game.People get back to Temple Run and Temple Run 2.<br /><br />Overall:It
0307279189|5.0|This is a book, I would really recommend to everybody who is interested in Running.<br />It is very fascinating and thrilling to read and for sure motivates you to go out and run 50 miles!!!<br />If you read it, plan in a lot more time for longer runs and more fun during your super long running sessions.<br />It also got me into barefoot running.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|After downloading the app, it worked for a few days, but then stopped working.  After trying to run it, it just shuts down by itself.
B00ANGICRE|5.0|At this time  of the year everyone is too busy  trying  to see all the  best picture nominees before the Academy Awards ceremony , including myself, that's how I found this one without  not even knowing  the plot.<br />Altough is it not a nominee for best pictures ( I don't undestand why) this is an oustsandig work of an amaizing and moving story. Helen Hunt gives a memorable performance and Jhon Hawkes is superb!!<br /><br />Don't hesitate to get this one , is one of those pictures you will want to see more than once!
0316224588|4.0|John Rebus should have died a young man with all the booze and cigarettes. His trusty Saab will take you on Scottish routes and towns you probably have never heard of nor want to visit from his description of the weather. A bit too much driving around for me but his plot demanded it. I found it slow going at the start and was about to toss it aside but it picked up nicely and turned out to be a pretty good read. Since I can't give it three and a half stars I'll settle for four.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|This game is very entertaining and like by all who has played it so far. It has an addicvtive quality to it.
0385512058|3.0|Poor Ferrazzi, a staunch Republican from Yale who found himself while meditating for 10 days in silence and quiet contemplation. Too bad the rest of us can't do the same rich-guy's trick.<br /><br />So, network ruthlessly, but think of PEOPLE first, but nothing is sacred, from church to probably hitting on pallbearers.  lots of common sense that not only SEEMS to repeat itself, but does, twice or more, in this waster of paper that is cowritten with (i.e.: spoken to) somebody else. Frequent referrals to Carnegie and lots of stuff that acts as reinforcement of stuff we know rather than anything that will blow you away. But yes, it is full of good ideas; you just needed to be pointed to many of them again.<br /><br />If you choose to read it as I did, with a notebook and pencil with frequent write-downs of pay numbers and pointers, you'll be able to resell it on amazon and REALLY feel smarter!
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|this movie is the best out of all the ice age movies and i would highly recommend this movie to anyone!
B001GUXJQA|5.0|Twists and turns with great characters, as always with Michael Connelly.  I'm always waiting for the next book from him.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Much of the &#34;science&#34; is unrealistic; dated, if you like. The special effects can seem a bit primitive now. Still; the humour that made many of these original episodes so enjoyable is still there. &#34;The Trouble with Tribbles&#34; has to be an all-time classic!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Blah..a lot going on...I hate movies that are being narrated.  Love Bruce though :) I doubt there's a loopers 2
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great. It is so addictive. Only problem I have is when the daily challenge has started it doesn't show up at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is is so cool and I cant wait to play once I'm done here. I would say get thisnow cause its the best
B001NHN7TU|4.0|Lots of action and comedy with great peformances by Fred Ward and Kevin Bacon.  By far the best of them.
B0001I562I|4.0|I first saw this movie long ago and far away when my daughters were young. I found the approach of the movie to an interesting theme novel and entertaining. The story line and acting were simple, but entertaining with some nice moments of comedy and touching personal relationships. It had a nice balance of plot and special effects (such as they were) that made the movie enjoyable for both kids and adults (for me at least). After many years my daughters and I talked about old movies we had watched and Navigator popped up as one of our favorites. We found it, I bought it, and a good time was had by all.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I rarely give 5 stars, but our family really enjoyed this movie. While we have seen some family movies which were to scary for younger children, this movie can be enjoyed by the whole family.  I even caught my husband laughing out loud. I would definately recommend this movie.
1419705849|5.0|My grandson collects the Wimpy Kid books so he was delighted to find this under the Christmas tree. He complimented me by say ' I really know him' It made me happy that Amazon sent an email to me that the new book was available.
B00AKYRCNY|4.0|This app helped keep my daughter busy for about 20 minutes yesterday during the superbowl! She likes how it makes the sounds of the vehicle while you are touching it. She has a thing for airplanes right now especially.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this game! Simple concept,but so much fun! This is definitely one of my favorite games!<br />I would recommend this game to anyone.
0345803493|5.0|I  have read her  books and really like them. I'm looking forward to reading any of her new books in the future.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Absolutely loved it! Very funny! My husband and I ended up watching it twice! Fat Amy was my favorite character.
0345803507|5.0|I have read almost all of his books and really like them. I'm looking forward to all his new books.
B005KELW26|5.0|This cover fits my Kindle Fire perfectly, I have no complaints what so ever about this product.  It is also very nice looking.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|My husband liked this more than I did. Being unrated it had a lot of sexual content and also a lot of blatant drug use. I just don't like that kind of movie. Overall I thought it was pretty stupid.
B003Q6D2BE|5.0|It was a throw back good time movie.  Loved every bit of it.  Don't think too much, just sit back and enjoy the show!  Seriously, one of the best movies that didn't get a ton of attention.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I love this game, as does my 5-year-old grandson. The graphics are amazing, and the game is very long. These developers are definitely worthy of watching. They have another game scheduled for Spring 2013 release, and I cannot wait!
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This movie is entertaining and makes you think...great acting as well. Quite a twist toward the end! Enjoyed it alot
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|I watched the movie wondering why she didn't just jerk a knot in his tail.  I felt sad for her and angry with him for the entire movie.  Only about 5 minutes of positive at the very end.  Sorry I wasted my money.
0394827996|4.0|This book gave me incredible insight into teaching others what you have not personally experienced. Seeing through the eyes of others. Awesome book!
B007ZGBZHE|2.0|I like the collaboration of Preston & Child and have enjoyed every book they've written, but it felt like, at times, they just mailed it in this time.  It seemed contrived at times, too obvious at others, and kind of weak all around.  Almost like they thought their readers are dumber now than they were with previous books...
B00005JN8Z|4.0|Quasi-religious and quasi-historical.  The film didn't develop the characters to the point where we really could know why they acted as they did.
B002HK9IDQ|3.0|I thought My Fair Lady was a full screen reproduction and I thought that was what I had ordered. That is my only dissatisfaction.
0757302661|5.0|I am so grateful for this book. Along with taking the Hypnobirthing classes and practicing with the CDs, this was such a wonderful resource in my natural birth experience.
B00A80SHFM|5.0|I've been listening to this sound tract constantly for the last month. Hugh Jackman's singing is so heartfelt. Gives me the shivers in places. Anne Hathaway has the MOST beautiful voice I have ever heard! Little Cosette's song is very sweet. Eddie Redmayne is a virtuoso. Who knew! I love this sound tract from the bottom of my heart!
B008BDZOZY|4.0|I was intrigued when I saw that David Byrne and St. Vincent had put out an album. David Byrne's band Talking Heads had been in existence seven years when St. Vincent was born, and the pairing of St. Vincent's musical style--which ranges from pop to indie rock to jazz--with Byrne's solid '80s funky bass-heavy sound, sounded fascinating. There's much to like about the album. St. Vincent's voice, so clear, rises above the deeper-register instrumentation that's Byrne's trademark. And Byrne brings uncomplicated enthusiasm to St. Vincent's sometimes almost gloomy sound.<br /><br />But while I enjoy the album, sometimes it seems as though the two artists never quite meshed their individual sounds. And
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Excellent DVD and CD, this is Led Zeppelin pure GOLD!! I recommend this for every rock fan, your library is not complete without this!!
B004RZGUBM|5.0|What can I say about Dickens? He's one of the best writers I've ever read. Great collection. All books in one. I recomend it.
B00932A2MC|5.0|I was told this movie was not good.  I thought it was excellent :) ... to the nay-sayers, it was action packed, no dry humor, and very thorough comparison to the game!!
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love all the ideas. As I am a crafter I would like to get to the ' how do you do it' part of the product.
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|This movie was really good.  A lot of unexpected things happened and it was a thriller.  Hard to determine what was going to happen next.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I needed. big enough to see and to operate. I can remember always hving to have a calculator in my purse. As my Kindle is there instead, this is great.
B008EQIA7W|5.0|I like a lot of &#34;different&#34; movies than my friends do and honestly, Sam Worthington anything is great for me :) ... He's delicious
B00881VLCE|4.0|This is fun. No mess to pick up after, and just for one. I use to play this years ago on the computer. Love it now on my Kindle
B00AMBM9MO|2.0|I was expecting a funnier movie.  It wasn't as good as I thought it was going to be. Disappointed entirely.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|They manage to get just about every action actor into this one, but story is weak and action is too contrived.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Clever, inventive, funny, technically sound, and thoroughly absorbing. The Martian is a great book and I loved it. I read it in one sitting, it was that engaging. More, please.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Had a lot playing this game. The graphics were very good and the story line was fun to follow. Overall the game was worth the price, can't wait for the next one.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|After watching seasons 1 and 2 of The Walking Dead on Netflix I'm officially hooked, I just had to pre-order season 3 on blu-ray just to find out what happens next. The Walking Dead isn't just about killing zombies, this is a very emotional tale about survival.<br /><br />The characters are all very interesting, the story keeps you coming back for more, there is NEVER a dull moment!<br /><br />The Walking Dead isn't just a TV show, this is cinema quality work and I'm very blown away.<br /><br />This needs to win a Grammy award.<br /><br />But this show is not for kids, seriously, it's highly graphic guts and gore and tons of blood, again I say THIS IS NOT FOR KIDS.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|My boyfriend at I both ADORED seasons 1 and 2.  Something about this season so far has felt rushed and messy.  The delicate, balanced, nuanced dialogue has given way to obvious, over-the-top soapy-ness.  Let's hope it redeems itself before the end!<br /><br />K
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love the newly added features to Temple Run 2! New environments and new obstacles make it more challenging &amp; fun. Very addicting!
B005FLX2WC|5.0|Excellent CD.  Beth Hart realy sings the blues.  Could have used more vocals from Joe, but his guitar definately does the job!!
0140544518|1.0|I bought this book for my daughter. It took almost a full month to arrive. I found that to be excessive since I paid alot for shipping and handling.  When it finally came we sat down to read it. Much to our surprise there was writing all over inside of it. This left me having to answer the question of why I bought some other little girls book. If I had known it was this damaged I would have not purchased it. I feel the description was very in accurate.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Fifty Shades of Greay Was SICK:  Can't believe they made a movie out of it.  Stopped reading after the first book..............so haven't read this one.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in years.  Simple truths revealing that simple is not shallow.  The truth is deep and flawed and imperfect.  Wonderfully written with insight I can only guess comes from experience.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|I never read this book in high school / college and had always wanted to.  It is a coming of age story that would be great for teenagers and college kids.  Not the best read for adults.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I love The L Word series. My girlfriend had never seen it so I bought the entire series and we're currently on season two! Awesome product and prompt delivery.
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|We were very excited to see this movie after all of the trailers.  However, the plot was cheesy and underdeveloped and the music was made up of bad covers of classic rock anthems.  That said, Tom Cruise was hilarious in the movie, but his role was much smaller than the previews would lead you to believe.
B0073XORLU|5.0|Another great album by Ian Anderson, showing me once again that he still has it. Not that I have ever really questioned it. I've enjoyed every album he's released, with Jethro Tull and otherwise.<br />And while I quite loved Rupi's Dance, and Secret Language of Birds, this feels like a sort of return to form; it's a bit rockier and a bit edgier than his last few works.
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|This movie is quirky and fun.  Everything you would expect from Wes Anderson.  I get happy every time I see the previews come on when I'm watching TV.
B000QQTP36|5.0|One of my favourite albums ever, now. Surely. I listen to it, all the way through, far too often for my own good. Her voice is so charming- and so are her lyrics and her melodies. It's all quite well done, and it doesn't feel so old as it is. It has an amazing relevance.<br />&#34;I lost something in the hills&#34; is my favourite, but as I said, they're all amazing.
B004F1F32A|4.0|This movie was entertaining and thrilling.  There were a lot of fun action scenes and some cool plot twists.  However, the plot and writing were unoriginal and you have to be ready to suspend your disbelief and cynicism of a weak plotline.
0486437507|5.0|It isn't a joke when they say this inspired much of 20th century horror writing. Horror of the unnameable is incredibly vivid here with the example of that dreadful play, &#34;The King in Yellow&#34;.<br />It's incredibly fascinating. A great concept.<br />Not a one of these stories were disappointing to me, though I certainly have my favourites.<br />&#34;The Yellow Sign&#34;, &#34;The Mask&#34;, and &#34;The Maker of Moons&#34; are all breathtaking.
B008HK3XU4|4.0|It does the job, kinda.  I wish it stood up better on its own.  You get what you pay for I guess.  It does clip in very securely and seems to be very well made.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|I read it when I was young and loved it. And while I have yet to read it again, I knew I had to add it back into my collection for my future use.
B0058H8V6K|5.0|Natalia Kills's debut album is a flawless representation of her personality and creative brain! She's so original, and this album is one of my favorites of all time!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I look forward to seeing each new episode. The pacing of the show, the witty dialogue, and the fantastic cast are all wonderful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that this game is very fun and addicting. I think that they should make it a little easier to get new characters.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I recommend this app for anyone. It shows the responsiblity and work it requires to keep a horse which is something most people don't think about when they get a horse.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|Wanted to hear this for years, and now that I finally have, think it was worth the wait.<br />I especially like the 2nd CD that lets you hear them work with the orchestra and realize<br />how truly talented Brian was with this concept.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|It is a fantastic book and movie, I bought them for my Mom for Christmas. It shipped in time and was appreciated,
006091307X|5.0|I feel like I have to read this book at least twice more before I could write the review I'd like to write. Perhaps I'll read it again and find time to alter these notes at a later date. For now, I'll just focus on the concept of the entire narrative as farcical critique of upper class Americana.<br /><br />Pynchon reveals anti-heroine Oedipa Maas as an adulteress on the novel's first pages, executor of the wealthy estate of a recently deceased ex-lover, Pierce Inverarity (How great are these names, by the way? All of Pynchon's choices for character names in this book are hysterically funny). Her journey from there is hilarious, surprising at every turn, chock full of conspiracy theory and peppered with meaningless sex and sexual advances. Oedipa's obsession with the mystery she believes Inverarity left behind for her to solve, that of an underground mail service called the Trystero, speaks to the boredom Pynchon assumes for the American upper class of his day, the longing for a purpose and constant uncertainty as to whether that purpose really means anything at all.<br /><br />Here are three quotes where I feel Pynchon writes very directly with regard to American life:<br /><br />\\"`I came,' [Oedipa] said, `hoping you could talk me out of a fantasy.'<br /><br />`Cherish it!' cried Hilarius, fiercely. `What else do any of you have? Hold it tightly by its little tentacle, don't let the Freudians coax it away or the pharmacists poison it out of you. Whatever it is, hold it dear, for when you lose it you go over by that much to the others. You begin to cease to be.'\\" (page 113)<br /><br />\\"You're chicken, she told herself, snapping her seat belt. This is America, you live in it, you let it happen.\\" (page 123)<br /><br />\\". . . maybe even [stumbled] onto a real alternative to the exitlessness, to the absence of surprise to life, that harrows the head of everybody American you know, and you too, sweetie.\\" (page 141)<br /><br />The Hilarius (another fantastic name, of course) quote from page 113 says to me that Pynchon feels we Americans need our fantasies, need an element of craziness in our lives because the easy life here isn't necessarily what people expect it to be. It's set up beautifully by Oedipa's desire at that moment to give up her search.<br /><br />The quote from page 123, Oedipa talking to herself about what she should be able to do, how she should be able to affect outcomes and events, delineates an expectation so many Americans have that's, unfortunately, not always met with success.<br /><br />The most powerful quote of the three, in my opinion, is the one from page 141. Whether Oedipa's mission was real or contrived, worthy or a waste of time, here she describes \\"everybody American\\" she knows as living with \\"exitlessness\\" and an \\"absence of surprise to life,\\" and includes herself in that group. Through Oedipa and her adventure and her own conflicting opinions about it, Pynchon conveys a strong desire to break from quotidian life in the leisure class, a yearning for any sort of struggle but an uncertainty about that very yearning.<br /><br />Part of what Pynchon writes in The Crying of Lot 49, in my opinion, presents random sex and infidelity as one answer attempted by people in Oedipa's shoes, the bored housewives and their working husband counterparts, and this purported solution comes up empty time and time again. Oedipa herself seems to realize this as the novel progresses, succumbing to seduction early on but then rejecting it and feeling disgusted by its perpetrators later. Surely a long essay could be written just about Pynchon's treatment of sex in this book, but this review is getting long, so I'll cut it off here.<br /><br />I loved this book for all of its complexity, this review is just a few thoughts on one theme that stuck with me.se) quote from page 113 says to me that Pynchon feels we Americans need our fantasies, need an element of craziness in our lives because the easy life here isn't necessarily what people expect it to be.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Ridley Scott has done it again!!<br /><br />A masterful craft further developing upon the themes of transhumanism from Alien and Blade Runner with the always fantastic Noomi Rapace as he lead. An all star dream cast with one of the greatest science fiction endings of all time.<br /><br />I look forward to its immediate sequel. :)<br /><br />And remember!:<br />\\"If you understand 2001: A Space Odyssey completely, we failed. We wanted to raise far more questions than we have answered.\\" - Arthur C. Clarke
B007SGLZP8|4.0|My first E-book in years made great reading for a round trip plane ride. Amazon requires six more words to complete this review. Phooey
B009TM689M|5.0|Our 7 year old, horse loving, grandaughter asked for this for Christmas.  She absolutely loves it.  Put it together by herself and plays with it constantly while writing scripts of horse competitions and shows and recording her works of art on the Lego stop action animation on her ipad.  It was well worth the price and a gift that she really enjoys that encourages her imagination and creativity while keeping her busy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Unless I can go back and take stars away from things I've already given 5 stars, this program breaks the 5 star system for me.  I did not think that any television production in the 21st century could portray such humanity.<br /><br />Unless you really hate costume period pieces; romances; great acting; incredible lighting, make-up, costumes, antiques, art,  classic British autos, and historical realism, you should find something to like about this show.  Even if you are something of a misanthrope, you'll find yourself empathizing with the characters as real people.<br /><br />If there was one possible negative criticism, it would have to be a politically oriented one, perhaps centering on the gentle, nostalgic portrayal of an aristocracy that had outlived its usefulness.  But then again, they were a historical fact, aptly portrayed here in their splendor and human frailty.  It would be a far reach to criticize this absolutely sweet and stirring drama for somehow glorifying or trying to bring back the problems of this era.  While possibly romanticizing the wealth and power of the few, it does remind us of the horrors of the era - the brutality of WWI, the mass death of the influenza epidemic, etc. and it often brings us hopefully back to the present with it's treatment of progress on social issues that persist to this day.<br /><br />My wife and I watched all 3 seasons of Downton Abbey over a period of two weeks.  It was one of the very rare times that we have ever sat spellbound in front of the boob tube for 8 hours straight over a weekend.  We did tune in for the last 4 minutes of the Superbowl afterward - but only because it was about time the Ravens won!  :)
B009738XXM|5.0|I was a bit skeptical to purchase this CD, but I didn't realize how many other songs I have already heard on the radio.  I love majority of the songs which is a rarity these days.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|the product was break, damaged and very cheaply made. it was not a real life proof case. I return the case the next day.
B009TZBEKW|4.0|This CD has a lot of great collaborative tracks and is a main reason why I recently purchased it.  I enjoy the variety.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If at all possible, Season 3 outdoes the previous 2 seasons. Shirley vs Maggie! It is like USA vs Great Britain
B00A3OTNTC|5.0|You can never go wrong with Pitbull.  He collaborates with numerous artists which makes his CDs worthwhile.  I am not a fan of the excessive foul language however.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its ok I'm liking the first one though more players<br />I guest I need to. get used to it more
B0099G3I96|3.0|The songs you hear on the radio are the ones to listen to.  A few other ones are good, but their new sound isn't too appealing.
B00AHTYGRW|1.0|I enjoyed 'Argo', but some people are talking this flick up as an Oscar winner for best picture. That I cannot see<br />I read a bout it in a lot of history books, this movie has a lot of issues :-(
B0072OFM28|3.0|There is absolutely nothing wrong with the product or the condition in which the product arrived to me in the mail.  My only warning is to Spartacus fans out there.  Season 1 was fantastic.  Season 2 is just nothing in comparison.  It's pretty easy to see the plot twists coming, the plot is very simple, and the main actor who now plays Spartacus looks, sounds, and acts rather differently from the original and it was hard to adjust to him.  Personally, if you're a Spartacus fan, stick with just the first season and call it quits.
B005KR6OBM|5.0|From the beginning to season 4, funny, funny, funny. Glad I purchased it, so I can keep laughing. Ha Ha
B002P5XXR0|5.0|If you're an Avatar fan, this collection of DVD's is well worth waiting for.  All the behind-the-scene features on how they created the movie with the technology that they had to use and sometimes invent was very interesting to watch and I actually learned a lot on how the method of filming this movie was done.  I loved it and my fiancee loves it (we're both huge James Cameron fans as well).
B001PU8N0I|5.0|When two people's life cross, the circumstances seen impossible. Can the truth really help or hurt all those involved.in this big secret????
B007SGM084|5.0|Modern day Cinderella love story with lots of erotic sex. The emotional connection between the characters is deep beyond words. My favorite series right now.
B0000B1OFN|5.0|Bought this for my husband. He always lked this movie since he had seen the older one years ago. He really enjoyed the remake.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I don't know how he comes up with these stories but this one is every bit as good as the others.  A great read!!
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over again, and I Have. The actors, the scenery, and the town are so quaint. The story is beautiful and very enjoyable.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Just another in a long line of great Harry Bosch stories.  Always the reluctant hero, he always gets the bad guy, and we get to learn something new about him along the way.  Michael Connelly is Excellent!
B00140PK6O|5.0|Steep in tradition and set in a world set apart. these people are all of a sudden facing changes that seem for them to be unreal<br />and at times frightening.
1603429999|5.0|it was in great shape and has a lot of information that a semi beginner would need to know. I am glad I have it in my library.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|After having come through so much, is Cranford ready to make a change?  The changes are life altering and eye opening.
B000002OMN|5.0|the best ever cd meat loaf ever did.<br />don't miss it if you like him.<br />but even if you never heard (how can it be?) meat loaf you have to buy this one
B004AKCME8|5.0|I received this movie as a gift for Christmas and just like it so much. The Owls are so wise and brave.
B000FQ4M58|5.0|meat loaf is one of my favourites player, and this one is a great album.<br />of course the best ever is Bat Out Of Hell II
0061743526|5.0|Bought this for my daughter's birthday and she loved it. The edition is beautifully encased. I am glad I purchased it for her.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|GREAT GAME very addictive.  I have it on my phone, my kindle fire, and my kindle fire HD.  my son got me started on this game, and i love it
B00005JOA0|5.0|If you like suspense, this one is a good movie.. She comes in out of the dark and is mysterious. She is determined to overcome great struggles.
B0035WKP5K|5.0|In my 10+ years of weight training, I have come across many books, but this one has great information to get beginners started working out, also to refresh a more experienced lifter. The detail and explanations are great! I highly reccomend the other books in this series to add to your collection!
B000VX6YCO|5.0|I had the same shoes about 30 years ago, in high school and college. I couldn't find a replacement pair for less than about $130 which, at the time, was way too much. There was no interent shopping back then, either.<br />I got them for considerably less recently thru Amazon.<br />They are just as I remembered them. I wore them the first day, all day, and they fit great. I love the grippy soles. I wear them to work as well as out and about. They are very well built and the leather is great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use basic calculator. Love this free version. Great for seasoned citizens because of the large, clearly marked keys. Contains banner ads but they aren't obstructive and easily ignored.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think that subway suffers is a good game because I think it is different than the other games that people made
B0094M4NBW|5.0|I bought this to stream, super pleased with it in HD, always pleased with Amazon's service. I can watch this movie over and over, it's always good!!!!
B00ATUEKY8|4.0|Very well written. If you've ever wondered how it feels to go from being normal to planning suicide, this book will lead you step my step into the darkness. Her initial thoughts are probably common, but she dwells on them longer and moves past normal. Since Plath actually did kill herself, it's believed to be an autobiographical novel. Very interesting, but not a happy story. I enjoyed reading it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I'm glad I can watch at my own pace. And the price is good once you buy the whole season
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|Practically the same story line as all the others, but the comedy is pretty good, and the squirrel (I just can't get enough of him - funny!).
1878424319|5.0|I loved this book and can only strive to live by the basic pricipals contained within.  Remembering is the key.
B001XUJNJ0|5.0|Can't believe I waited so long to see it. Amazing movie. Can't wait to see it again. Love the ending.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This show is addictive!  Definitely purchase the entire series.  Best show since &#34;24.&#34;  I have purchased the first four seasons and am waiting for season 5 to be released.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|not sure if temple run 2 is better then the first - still not sure how I feel about the mine section. regardless, just like the first it is amazingly fun and challenging! great play, beautiful design, and most importantly an all around fun game.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I tried to limit myself to one episode a day.  But the show was so addictive, I couldn't stick to my resolution.  Kudos to Vince Gilligan for giving us something out of the ordinary to watch
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This CD is amazing, Macklemore is not afraid to rap about controversial issues like save sex marriage, God, over coming addiction, etc. i would highly recommend this CD to anyone that has had to deal with any of these issues
B007PVHANM|5.0|Good price came right on time,  have all Bob Marley DVDs this is the best one had stuff on there I hadn't seen before
1609611543|5.0|This book is the most exceptional information book I have found.  It explains why we are so obese in this era, and is a wonderful guide to healthy eating.  We don't realize how much wheat is in our foods.  I was flabberghasted to find when I read the label on Campbell's Tomato Soup, that it contains wheat starch.  Who would have guessed!  And wheat is everywhere, in everything.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game - it is very challenging but it does get frustrating when one little pig refuses to die.  Some of the levels do get harder so I'm still working on it.  But I would recommend getting this game for hours of fun.
B00846TTDG|4.0|I went into this movie expecting to hate it but I could not recommend it more, highly recommend watching this on Netflix or Amazon.
B008DVJO8C|3.0|This album is... Okay. In This Moment has definitely changed with every single album they've released; Beautiful Tragedy was hard and gritty, then they went right in to The Dream which had a much more lyrial feel with pretty much none of the grit from Beautiful Tragedy. Then came the happy medium that was found with Starcrossed Wasteland, which I though to be a near perfect synergy of their previous two albums. Blood, to me, feels like a very awkward step back towards Beautiful Tragedy, and probably not for the better. I admit that the title track does start to grow on you, but none of the other tracks on the album really strike me as anything I'd like to hear more of from In This Moment.<br /><br />So, if you loved Beautiful Tragedy, this album is probably more your speed. If you were a fan of The Dream or A Starcrossed Wasteland, you may want to give this one a miss. And if you're just a strait In This Moment fan... Then you probably didn't read this review and already bought the album regardless of what everyone else thought.
B008JH5CVS|1.0|One of the worst movies ever made, don't waste your time watching this.  Watch Blackhawk Down or The Matrix or another classic.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a long time. Very creative. Something to be treasured and read more than once, perhaps to your children and then your grandchildren. Looking forward to more from Mr. Sloan in the future hopefully.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Crazy fun, the game is tricky at times. Subway Suffers is fun for all ages, the graphics are so colorful.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey has it all: drama, action, romance, suspense, and comedy.  The costumes and sets are AMAZING, and the soundtrack pulls you in...all making you long to be part of 1920s England high society.<br /><br />I stumbled across Downton Abbey on PBS about 2 years ago, right at the end of Season 1 (here in the states).  I immediately went online and bought the dvd.  My husband walked in when I was watching and got sucked in as well, and is now as avid a fan as I am.<br />It seems to have taken forever for Season 3 to start here in the US (especially because of the anticipation of \\"Will they\\" or \\"Won't they\\" marriage between Mary & Matthew.  Finally it arrived and I watched the whole season in one sitting.  There is lots to see this season, and plenty of tears (both of joy and sadness)--so have tissues ready!<br />After the pivotal season ending we have to wait the grueling year for Season 4!<br />(leaving plenty of time to watch all three seasons over and over!)
044022425X|4.0|Purchased this book as a gift.  Recipient enjoyed reading.  considered it an excellent story well told.  She also read a couple more from this author.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Typical Grisham. Fun, relaxed entertainment.<br />Would recommend this book if you simply want to relax an  enjoy. Always like what he produces
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I have yet to meet someone that doesn't like game of thrones.  It has something for everyone: action, drama, romance, humor.  The only problem is that it's hard to stop watching.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is unbelievable it made me laugh and cry I can't wait to read the next one it's awsome
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put it down!!<br />Gripping and unbeliveable , yet so real at the same time.<br /><br />Do yourself a favour and just download the trilogy. You will not regret it.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I first played this on the computer when TD3 came out. I love this game because it isn't bloody and has fun characters. Another reason is that this is one of the things that I am better at than my bro. : )  I highly recommend this to every one!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I bought this book based on one of the reviews and I was not disappointed.  My days were not long enough to finish it in one reading session, and I needed atleast 2 chapter breaks :-)<br /><br />As I read, I thought aahhhh I know what is going to happen, and it didn't.  Every little twist caught me off guard.  The first non-kiss was beautiful, the pinky holding ...I have no words.<br /><br />I loved this book from the beginning to the absolute last page and highly recommend it.  I havent enjoyed a book like this in absolute years.  I will definitely read it again in a few months.<br /><br />Buy it now and enjoy
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game. The reason I gave it only four stars is that the game isn't a good as the game is on Apple products or Samsung! Like the graphics. The coins spin on the other product but not on Amazon!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking dead is a great TV series and season 3 has been spectacular so far!  I can't wait for more episodes!
B00AMBH70S|3.0|Well, the legacy is without Matt Damon this series dies. The action scenes work well here but the plot is even more convoluted with what looks like flashback clips from the other three movies. Sorry, Jeremy Renner, but I'm out. Just did not surprise and enthrall me like the very first Bourne movie did out of the blue or the third one did for all-out action.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|good picture and very fun game. like the Sims but with a horse.  so cute and the kids love it
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a sweet, simple book that makes you realize your own character and think about how you treat others. You instantly love Auggie, though in real life someone like him might make you uncomfortable upon first meeting them. It gave me a greater desire to be a better human being... can't say anything negative about something that does that!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|It was a good movie that your family could watch together. I like that it didn't have tons of the &#34;F&#34; word or bunches of sex scenes.
0784011680|5.0|The quality was good.  The packaging was great.  It came a few days before the deadline on arrival.  Most of all I love Robert Downey Jr.  I'll have to say this was pricey for a 21yr. old movie and I was considering returning it for that reason alone.  Other than that great entertainment.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I found this to be a wonderful, deeply philosophical action movie that leads us to think about our own existence , our uniqueness in the universe and our ultimate relevance. I think many have a problem because the role of God is left to our speculation, but this actually elevates Deity beyond human understanding--just where It should be. The feeling of aloneness this leaves makes us shudder before the Here and Now. Our immediate progenitors are spacemen who apparently have scorn for us and want to wipe us out, to denude Earth of human life. Strong as they are, they are mortal, and they can be eaten alive just as humans have been in previous Alien films by something they wished to use to wipe out humanity.<br /><br />Yes, humans perform some silly deeds in this film--just as humans often do. We wouldn't have tragedy if humans always acted  perspicaciously. The point is that we're human, and although we can be brilliant, we can also be very impulsive and foolish. I don't see that the plot shows anything other than human fallibility and a fragility of intellect under the pressure of emotions such as fear, lust for power and superiority and sexual abandon. Finally, we are led to ask why we are here, why our \\"engineers\\" (creators) have found us wanting and where do we go from here? Where are you, God? We need you!<br /><br />The 3-D is glorious, the effects stupendous. I couldn't have asked for more. I saw it with an adult goddaughter who had asked to see it, and she couldn't stop saying \\"wow!\\". I think that, if you've seen this in 2-D, you owe it to yourself to see it in 3-D. The PQ is sharp, clear, revealing of detail, and the audio is perfect. We played it on my Oppo on a 55\\" passive system  LG with a 7.1 home theater setup. Much better than being in the theater.<br /><br />Don't let the naysayers dissuade you. This is a truly fine film which will ultimately rank up there with Ridley's best. It makes us long to know how we can somehow make ourselves count for more than \\"teardrops in the rain\\".
B004QX07G4|4.0|I'm enjoying this book she is so frank and funny, This is my first book on my new kindle. Good Reading.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this series!!!  A great love story, didn't want it to end.  Can't wait to see what she comes out with next.....
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|Saw the movie; loved it.  I knew I had to have the cd.  The music is great and the soundtrack is the best!  I loved singing along to the music at the top of my lungs like a fool.  You gotta love the music.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Well worth the time to read. Ryan creates an intricate world and, in my opinion, dynamic characters. An excellent adventure/fantasy novel. Cannot wait for the next book! My only complaint (which didn't lower my rating, obviously) was that the editing is a little choppy, but that's easy to ignore and doesn't interfere with reading.
B005T87QCI|4.0|Its got great graphics. developing add ons and I cant get enough of it. its just great. I love it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I would say that its ok...its free and i keep playing it so its worth a try I guess. I find it to be a decent time killer
B0084TWN9K|4.0|Quirky and offbeat stories and very well written.  Much better reading than the title would suggest.  Will definitely seek additional works by this author.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I love Facebook don't get me wrong but I just don't like looking at it on my Kindle Fire, it is different than looking at it on my laptop..
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very cool game. Keeps you on your toes and thinking all the time. My youngest daughter really seems to enjoy it too.
B00A757EFW|3.0|I am not sure about this game, haven't had time to find out how to play it all the way..
B008HT4FUW|5.0|This program is EXCELLENT.  Great actors and very good story line. My husband and I are addicted to it .  We cannot wait for the next episode.<br />I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in historical times.
0399160450|5.0|Read 800 pages in three days.  Could not drop the book.  The story line is one that could easily happen in today's world.  A must read.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|it was a good movie but I want the next one now. when wil the new (2nd) one be ready to buy? soon I hope
B0026KX5PO|1.0|i spent 30 minutes looking at the tv trying to load this movie and when it came on it just kept stopping every 30 seconds - i rebooted the router twice to no avail - i have no problem streaming hd video from netflix - i won't use amazon again - waste of money
B004SBBDB2|2.0|It works. But the part that connects to the iPad/iPhone does not stay it place. If you start typing or move the apple product slightly, the connection may be lost. Pretty annoying. I do not reccoomend this.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|Okay, I read this because the grandkids read it and I liked it - I considered reading the whole series but haven't yet
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a pretty fun game. as a horseman the form of horse and rider are quite wrong but the game looks great and works great!!
B0070ZLZ1G|2.0|I heard the author speak at a conference and he was excellent. The book had me bogged down much of the time.
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|some of the core elements that made Rodriguez legendary was inflated and not well supported or documented-- for example only one account (the writer's) of Rodriguez's alleged suicide where he pulled a gun out on stage at a performance and shot himself in the head. There weren't other visible accounts of this in the documentary, just a blurred out newspaper article.
0062060554|1.0|Who realizes this entire premise was stolen from 50 First Dates with Adam Sandler ? Honestly how can this not be noted.
1616550414|5.0|This book is full of so many things I don't even know where to start.  The outer cover is beautiful and if I ever get a coffee table some day this will be prominently displayed.  The content of the book is full of great concept art from every game in the history of Zelda, and thats what this book is really about, the history of the Zelda series.<br /><br />For those who always wondered how the various Zelda games link (pun intended) together, this does a fairly good job explaining this, with Nintendo's official explanation of the triple timeline split after Ocarina of Time.  (as opposed to the dual timeline split theorized for years by fans).  They could have done a slightly better job explaining HOW the timeline makes sense, but they simply show you the timeline and expect you to take their word for it.  From what I can tell the timeline DOES work, with a little bit of imagination.<br /><br />Aside from the timeline, there is also the backstory and design history of each character and monster, and of course all the great concept art that went into designing them.  I haven't gotten a chance to look at it in detail yet, but it looks like the last 50 pages or so are a full color Zelda manga.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This was a read that I could pick up or put down without a drain on my emotions. Easily pulling bits of each character and being able to see them in my own way with enough detail to help form them. I enjoyed the way Morgenstern put her characters together. The way they could ebb and flow into each others lives was a bit predictable but seriously with the amount of reading I have done, there is not much that isn't. I look forward to more from this author.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|I must say that I am new to the series, but the first episode had me hooked. I can't wait to watch more!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Well, if you read the Sleeping Beauty trilogy you'll see why I am bored.  This is okay though...but my mother read it, ugh.
1780873808|5.0|I love this trilogy and ordered The Chessmen from Amazon UK as soon as it was published as I just couldn't wait for the US publication. I'm just sorry that the storyline has to end. I have read other Peter May books which were fine but didn't compare to this series.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Beautiful graphics. Lots of new obstacles and challenges. I could sit and play this for hours and not tire of it!
0062012339|5.0|very nice book<br />very worth reading and i can only recommend it you will not regret it at all !
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|The movie was great, the picture was crispy, and the sound was great!<br />Always loved the Avengers but great for anyone who just started watching.
0743486285|5.0|absolutely great book<br />it is a good example for many people and it is an inspiration also<br />just great how he got out of his addiction
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best games I've played since temple run they may have the same concept but this one is still pretty awesome =D
1419702238|5.0|This was a great book at a great price. It was cheaper than buying it in the store and was the same quality.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is easily one of the best films I have seen in my lifetime. The acting, directing, music, filming, everything about this movie is perfection. Words cannot explain my love for this masterpiece!
0345803493|5.0|Great book for a great price. It was cheaper than buying it at the store but was the same quality.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this entire series.  I can't wait for season four to begin!  Worth the purchase!<br />Don't hesitate to watch this!
0439023513|5.0|This was a great book at a great price. It was cheaper than buying it in the store and was the same quality.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this case! What a rich feel! The color is beautifully bright and the lettering is free flowing, easily displaying the various cities chosen. The fit is perfect. A side pocket for storage adds to the appeal.
0345803507|4.0|This book was in great condition when I received it. Also, its a good book as long as you have read the first two in the series. The first two are better, as is typical with trilogies but overall still very good. Recommend the entire series.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is so great. My daughter loves this game and wants a real horse. Best thing ever for long trips.
0439023491|5.0|This was a great book at a great price. It was cheaper than buying it in the store and was the same quality.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Never thought this game series would be this good. Love this revamped version. Better graphics is the best the part.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|If your movie is one endless chase scene, and you still can't keep my interest, you're doing it wrong.  Skip this one and go watch the original!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a wicked sick game ALL must have. +5stars<br />This is a game full of many jumps, ducking, and maneuvering.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good story.  Nicholas keeps you guessing.  Also an occasional twists and turns and surprises.<br /><br />Once you start reading his stories you can't seem to put them down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a great game it is very fun also you get chased so it feels like your in the game. When you collect coins you get lots of Money wish that was real money. It is a great fun game
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great app for lulling me to sleep!  There are so many different sounds that I get to choose from that make it great addition to my kindle.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I enjoy playing Minecraft Pocket Edition very much, it's ALOT of fun to mess around in Creative Mode, and tons of fun to go monster hunting in Survival. (Just beware the Creepers! Haha!)<br />As much fun as it is, I've gotta ask why Update 0.6.0 hasn't been released to us yet, when everyone else has it. What's going on, Amazon?<br />I've also gotta say that I'm very excited for 0.7.0 to be released, because it will add in Online Multiplayer, chats, and hopefully the ability to change your skins. 0.6.0 is exciting and all that, but 0.7.0 has to be one of the most anticipated and hoped for updates.<br />I'm also hoping that we will be able to use cheats in 0.7.0 so we can switch between Survival and Creative on the same world.. Maybe Mods, too.. And would it kill them to add in Enderman? LOLOLOLOLOL
0446554995|4.0|I've been a huge Preston and Child fan since Relic and anxiously await every new effort from them either as collaborators or solo. I'm usually not disappointed. However, I've not been real happy with the direction of the Pendergast series. I long for the icky bug days of Relic. Some may say they can't do a monster of the month thing forever, but I still really miss it. When they veered off into the Diogenes trilogy, I almost gave up on the series. I'm glad I stuck it out because they seem to be steering back to a more interesting plot line... sort of.<br /><br />When I met Doug at a book signing a few years ago here in Las Vegas, I pleaded with him to get back to the icky bugs with Pendergast and he said they were leaning that way. Unfortunately, that's not what this story is doing. I'll admit what they came up with is very science fiction/horror (icky bug) leaning, but it turns out to be just Nazi fare already done a bunch of times. I really have no problem with that specifically, it's just that the way this one turned out didn't quite measure up in certain ways.<br /><br />I can see Pendergast having a messed up family. That makes for great drama. However, I hated what happens to all of his family members. Even though other reviewers have probably given away every single plot detail, I'm not going to. Let's just say that who dies and who doesn't didn't leave me with a warm fuzzy, even if the authors did it all for the sake of drama and more sequels.<br /><br />Then there are the side stories and unresolved threads. There are two distinct side stories that either shouldn't have been there at all, or should have been tied into the main plot somehow. They are both characters from past installments so I appreciate carrying on their stories, but they could have been given full novels maybe or as I said, been tied into this one instead of just being tagged on. Not only that, but there are elements of both of them that are just left hanging. That's not good at all, even though both were resolved in a way I'd be happy with if they were really resolved.<br /><br />The issue I have is that the writing is so well done. I don't mean the plot or any suspension of disbelief. I have a high tolerance for that. I mean, they write well. They are in solid third-person, have no extraneous narrative or exposition and keep the story moving at a fast clip. That made this story a lot of fun despite the flaws. It also makes it so much harder to be critical of them. I love their writing.<br /><br />The problem is that despite all the enjoyment I had reading this, at the end, I didn't come away with the complete warm fuzzy I should have had from what could have been another great Pendergast novel. I'll say it is by far much better than the last one. Another thing I just thought about. The title. It doesn't have much of anything to do with the actual story. From reading the thank you at the end and from recalling some of their newsletter stuff, I think someone gave them the title from a contest. If that's the case, great, except Pendergast never really goes out for revenge or gets it in the way the quote at the beginning makes you think. It's kind of misleading. Well, it's no more misleading than most book jacket descriptions so I can't really hold that against them.<br /><br />All in all, I still had a great time. Recommended if you can look past the obvious flaws.though both were resolved in a way I'd be happy with if they were really resolved.<br /><br />The issue I have is that the writing is so well done.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|very very good , love it. the Piano Guys are the best. There videos should be seen by all . So watch them and you will see for yourself. ps buy this cd you will like it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game cause its simple to play. You can switch the card decks too. Its easy to play too.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app ia so much fun and I waste all my spare time playing. But on the kindle fire it freezes all the time and sometimes wont even let me open the app. So its a little annoying but its a fun game.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loved the first book. This one paled, was somewhat plodding. Not nailing my interest as much as I expected. Minute by minute dialog from Katniss, a little annoying and frustrating. Still, arguably, a fine book with a great premiss. I love the way the author weaves an offbeat yet believable story. It seems like it could happen, so makes me like it more. On to the next one.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Well written and balanced.  Author doesn't strive to be sensational about this sensitive subject.  Wasn't sure when I bought it for $1 but did not regret it and enjoyed the book.  Even loaned it to my daughter.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Yes, I couldn't put it down which is something I usually can't do with thrillers, but the author writes so well about the people involved in this story that I had to turn the next page and then the next and the next to find out what was going to happen.  And, boy, did events occur!  I recommend every man on the planet to read this book. The heroines are inspiring.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I thought all was great with this entry into the DC Animated Universe. The one thing I'd change is the voice for the Joker. Something is missing. In my opinion a LOT is missing. Not menacing enough. Not &#34;twisted&#34; enough. No irony. In fact even after watching this a few times I have a hard time remembering the voice. The rest of the voice cast is spot on. The graphics are a pretty honest representation of the graphic novels. Overall a very very good effort on DC's part.
B000002UA2|5.0|One of many underrated albums of their catalog. True Floyd fans often get tired of listening to the same old Dark Side of the Moon, The Wall albums flock to albums like this one, Saucerful of Secrets, Meddle, More, and Animals which always seem to take a backseat to the Wish You Were Here's and DSotM's. Don't get me wrong those albums were great and deserve all the praise they get, but albums like this one never seem to get old when you don't wear them out they way that the others get worn out by casual fans and classic rock radio. My favorite songs are the title track, Wots.. uh the deal, Stay, and Burning Bridges.
B005LAIGP0|3.0|I enjoyed \\"The Woman in Black,\\" but not as much as I thought I would. It's a good ghost story/thriller, and Daniel Radcliffe delivers a strong performance in his first post-Harry Potter film. Visually, the film is impressive to watch, but I thought the pacing of the story was a bit odd throughout, and the end of the movie was unnecessary and super awful, to be quite honest. It kind of ruined the whole movie for me. This movie is worth watching, but I will never watch it again.
B003VANOFY|5.0|It came as described, just like the G35 I had before, it is a quality product. Logitech is a great brand for headsets.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a horse crazy adult who is owned by several real horses and I love this game! Once you let it get past the super slow load for the first time or so, it's well worth it. Fun and interactive. Graphics are amazing...especially for a freebie! I recommend it highly if you enjoy the &#34;horsey&#34; type games...no, its not like owning a real horse, but its a GAME so its all about the fun...right?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive fun, easy to drop into, equally easy to spend ages playing. Good graphics and can get good with practice
B00AJRQLTI|4.0|After seeing the movie a purchased this soundtrack. It is not as good as the earlier cast recordings from the broadway show but it is still good enough. Hugh Jackman is wonderful, but the soundtrack brings out Russel Crowe's short comings as a singer. Still nice way to 'relive' the movie.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS GAME IS SO FUN! my friend had it and I kept waiting for kindle fir to get and then it did and now Im happy!!!! its so fun!!!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A fantastic book about untold ties between aviators. Sometimes blood is thicker than policies. Not to believe that the were able to meet so many years later!
1476712042|5.0|This was such a good book. I was really happy to find out the author was releasing another book from Travis's point of view.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|There are more memorable lines in this film than probably any other I can think of. Its a brilliant piece of writing and acting and an all time favorite bit of cinema history. It is brilliant coupling of farce with deep philosophical concepts but if you choose to just enjoy the comedy there is a very enjoyable afternoon of movie watching here. Jimmy Stewart is at his penultimate, it is perfect casting ( as are the rest of the cast).  A true gem of American cinema.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very realistic and fun. Sometimes it does take along time to load  and is picky about when it wants to play but other than that great app and very addicting<br />great for all ages
1449410243|4.0|I thought this was a pretty humorous book.  It did have some inappropriate material that made me gun-shy about sharing it with some of my older cat-loving friends.....

B005IQZB14|5.0|A really interesting true story about a woman hiking the PCT by herself after her life pretty much falls apart. Written well - I literally couldn't put it down, finished in 4 days! Made me want to backpack!
0062020897|5.0|This is a book that really got me into reading a lot.  It was so exciting it was difficult to put down and I looked forward to picking it up every time.  Read the whole thing in 1 week which is good for me cause I'm not a very fast reader.  I look forward to reading some more Ken Follet books.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|A great novel for people who seek adventure and can have a good laugh too. I recommend it for all.
B006TLFPKO|2.0|My wife loves these kind of movie.  I don't.  She watched the whole thing, but after I started streaming the movie and went back into the living room to watch it with her, she looked at me and said, &#34;It's sappy.  I went into the office and worked on my taxes.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I absolutely love this movie.  I've watched it a million times and would watch a million more.  Great shape, thank you.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Okay story but not a lot of depth or story line.  Predictable, you know how it'll end  typical romance story
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was a good book, and a lot of adventure, it was so exciting, and the setting was really good
B005URRCUY|5.0|Listened to Thickfreakness and then El Camino back to back on a long road trip.  Clearly the band is maturing but still brings the legit &#34;old school&#34; sound they introduced with Thickfreakness. I had no idea how much play the Black Keys get on tv and in movies until now. This one has has a permanent place in my &#34;road trip&#34; cd's.
B003VB5D84|5.0|I bought this DVD set for my husband.  It was one of his birthday presents, and he absolutely loves it!!!
B00008O31H|5.0|What an introduction to The Black Keys.  A legit old school sound with each song bringing something different to the ear. A must have for anyone that wants to follow this bands rise,

B002K0WBXW|5.0|The Proposal stars Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds as the main characters. A woman named Margaret(Sandra Bullock) is high powered editor in New York. Margaret is from Canada. When Margaret finds out she at risk of being deported back to Canada Margaret has an idea. Margaret talks her assistant, Andrew (Ryan Reynolds) to marry her so she does not have to leave New York. At first Andrew was not happy about marrying Margret. Margret and Andrew go for a weekend to meet Andrew's family and friends in Alaska. Andrew's family fall in love with Margaret. Watch this movie to find out if Andrew's family ever finds out about Margret at risk being deported. Also find out if Margaret and Andrew ever gets closer than they were in the beginning of the movie. This movie is really good. You will not regret watching this movie!

0843133333|5.0|My two year old niece loves this book. Super cute illustrations and great story. Can't wait to buy her the other books in the series.
B00ARAO720|1.0|This movie is just plain dumb. It's mostly a collection of bicycle stunts. The story line is dumb, the dialogue is dumb, the premise is dumb, and I turned it off half-way through. Don't waste your $3.99 if you don't like dumb stupid movies.
B00008ACIN|5.0|Two band members but LOTS of sound. Meg might not be the bangin'-est drummer, but this album rocks my face off -- which I feel is even better than a face mask cream or jojoba beads for healthy exfoliation. &#34;Seven Nation Army&#34; is particularly good for that deep-clean feeling.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Good story, good animation, good for family viewing, technically well made, a good all around film.  Only problem I found was lighting could have been a little brighter in places.
B002PMPTIO|4.0|This film shows us how Capt. Kirk and his gang met each other and started their vogages together.  I did not enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  The actions of the young Kirk are way over the top and are not realistic.  Still, there is a ton of action and the villian is evil.  If you are into Star Trek fan, a must have DVD.
B007ZTLLMK|4.0|it needs a pause button. now I need to finish out the number of words required to submit this review
B00005JN8Z|3.0|This 1951 MGM epic is boring.  The actors are the biggest Hollywood players at that time- and they play their parts woodenly.  The script does not protray real people.  The photography is good, but the film runs way too long.  I can recommend this film only to those who want to see an early 1950s Hollywood epic more than anything else in life.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|While this movie is not up there with 2001, it has a little bit of the same feel. I enjoyed it, kept my attention.
1451627297|5.0|I was immediately drawn into this book. No one can tell a story quite like Stephen King. Another daunting 849 pages was soon forgotten once I was swept into the story of Jake/George and his odyssey from 2011 into the world of 1958-1962, which he had never been a part of since it was several years before his birth. Kudos to Mr King for a fantasy well done. If you had the chance to change history, would you? There's much to consider.....
B009S33I68|5.0|Very well written! Did not want to put it down! Includes many first hands accounts from survivors. I am absolutely amazed at what those men had to endure and that they had the strength to continue. So many brave men lost! I salute those that died as well as the survivors. Thank you for your service to this wonderful country of ours!
B0034G4OVS|4.0|This is a very good movie, given the unique premise, interesting dialogue, well-acted, and nail-biting levels of suspense in the last hour. Unfortunately, there are a few negative aspects that prevent this movie from becoming a classic. I realize that this is only a movie, but most of the characters' actions while stranded on the ski lift was highly illogical. Yes, they didn't expect to be placed in a survival situation, but you'd think they would have more common sense. I will refrain from adding any further details to avoid spoilers. Anyway, I was able to overlook these minor issues because the movie was otherwise well made. The biggest problem for me was the portrayal of wolves. The movie would have still been good (perhaps even better) without the wolves. It seems that the director wanted to have some gore and a greater sense of danger (if being stranded on a ski lift in freezing weather wasn't enough), and the wolves were the only way he could accomplish this task. I feel that a bear or mountain lion, while they would normally be hibernating during this time, would be slightly more credible. My last criticism would be the ending. I feel it would have been more effective to end the credits without knowing if all (or any) of the characters have survived. This movie is certainly as good, if not better, than Open Water. Let's hope the director decides to make Frozen 2, but with a better script next time.
B004T5K3OK|2.0|I didn't much like the setup of this 'CamScanner'...it was blurry most of the time because the camera on my phone isn't all that great and I kind of felt like I could have just taken a regular picture, uploaded it onto my computer, edited it, and saved it as a PDF with the same ease....its not the most user friendly...
B004J4WLB4|5.0|great story, unable to understand why main character did some of the thing she did.  Hope they<br />all live happily ever after.
B0081JPTCQ|1.0|This app was way too confusing to use. I ended up deleting it off my phone. All I wanted was an app I could add to my phone that would let me 'jot' down quick notes instead of sending myself text messages. I guess I'll just have to keep searching for one...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Well written show.  Refreshing to see unknown actors.  Intelligent.  Tries to answer questions to which there are no easy answers.  Thoughtful.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is the most addicting game i have ever played!! It is greatly amusing! It starts off easy, but gets hard really quick!
B005Z271Y6|5.0|Love it....completely....the music cd is a nice addition and the blu-ray is great.  I would purchase this great product again!!
B005LAJ16I|4.0|My wife and I watched the series in a few days. Tremendously exciting that kept you on the edge of your seat..
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Enjoyed being able to watch at my convenience via RoKu.  An incredible production - Gives one a picture of history from various social perspectives.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|The game works well and moves quickly.  The special  Jewels are add a great touch.  I look forward to playing it often.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|Couldn't put it down.<br />Very involved plot with lots of turns.<br />Would recommend this book to anyone...both men and women.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My kids are 6 and 3 and they love this movie.  it's energetic and funny.  they love the music, it's great.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|My daughter and I enjoy watching this show and two of the episodes were such classics she wanted to be able to see anytime she needed a good laugh so I purchased it as a Christmas present for her
0470424702|4.0|I think the author is a very smart person and organized the book in a very interesting and order way. But it is still a hard reading book, the reader should have basic financial knowledge, otherwise it will be very hard to understand what the author talks about.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game so far, hope it stays that way. Easy installation and easy to use. Wish there where more choices with different horse types.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I wouldn't recommend this book to just ANYONE, because there are a lot of references, which can be kind of distracting, however I was captivated and felt as if I was part of the ride. I believe Ernest Cline did a wonderful job making the audience believe this world can exist, as well with relating to the characters. If you are a nerd, and proud of it like I am, you will get sucked in just as I did. I thought it was awesome, imaginative, creative, and so much fun. Emotional strings will be pulled, but in the end, it feels so rewarding. Funny thing about this book is, it makes a lot of 80's references, and I never even saw that decade, but I can relate to the story still because of how I grew up, so I guess you can call me a Gunter trying to find my own egg. Ha! I want to say more but I can't, I need to chill from reading this, have fun!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|The Alarm clock worked for me but if your a heavy sleeper you probably wont hear it. And I am one of those people who need some kind of obnoxious noise to wake me up as apposed to a soft melody that would put me back to sleep.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I started with pinhog till I found this one and downloaded it. Very easy to use. I am addicted and would suggest the app for anyone who wants to know anything about anything. Keep track of your items and even have secret boards for yourself.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|It gave me weather for my town and that is all I was looking for. It also has several different options to look at such as pollen count around your area. which is helpful for anyone with pollen allergies.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|This is a very good game the only reason I give it four stars is because I wish that the gameplay would be at a quicker pace. I mean it's kind of slow but it's still very fun
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pintrest and this is a pretty easy app to get through it. Even for beginners who are not quite as familiar with the functions of the Kindle Fire.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|What more do I have to say hehe. Well if your looking for a scientific calculator this is not the one for you. it is a simple calculator that will not do everything for you so you would actually have to do some work in that equation.
B009X011UQ|2.0|I like the sturdiness of the case, and its slim profile which allows me to slip it into my man purse. The main reason I bought it was for the hand-strap on the back. The problem is ergonomic. If you are using the iPad vertically it ’feels' great, however, horizontally it feels terrible. To fit your hand in it you have to torque you wrist in an awkward way that is very uncomfortable. If I were to buy another case I'd get one that has a hand strap that rotates.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Its Angry Birds..... who doesn't like angry birds. Kid Friendly for my kids ranging from 4 to 8 they love it.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Temple run 2 includes twists turns and.... dead ends. The monster monkey is larger and doesn't have friends chasing you but the entire game is lacking in my opinion.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Rothfuss masterfully begins to tell the story of Kvothe's life from Kvothe's point of view.  At first, I was reluctant to pick up the Kingkiller series, even declining a friend's offer to lend me the books, because I have not typically enjoyed books written in the first person.  Ultimately, I bought The Name of the Wind because I needed something to read while waiting for the release of A Memory of Light.  It is a month after that release, and I still don't own it.  I have read both of The Kingkiller Chronicles books.  They are fantastic.  As Kvothe recounts the events of his life, Rothfuss writes with all of the detail necessary to adequately paint settings and describe characters and events.  Story lines are woven seamlessly without belaboring the point, as many fantasy authors tend to do.  I truly enjoyed both of Rothfuss's books and highly recommend them.
B004ULNJIU|5.0|A Jason Statham classic. Hadn't heard of this movie through the regular media outlets but took the time to watch it and really liked the film.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|Exciting with just the right amount of gore. Frequent plot twists and great performances by leads will keep you watching!
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|The book is totally improbable from beginning to end.  The characters, from the bimbo policewoman through to all the others are just cardboard cutouts and totally unbelievable as real people.  The book is peppered with sickening and unnecessary violence.  I really regretted buying this book.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this app it's awesome. This works great on my kindle fire hd. its worth every penny. True this is not like the computer game is actually easier, but still just as scary! Trust me THIS IS A MUST GET APP!!!!!!!!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This fantastic tail throws you into a adventure full of delight and scares. This book is fascinating. Incredible!! Amazing! I applaud L.

0399160450|5.0|This was an incredible read. I absolutely loved this book. I was so engrossed in the story that I found it very hard to put down. It was dramatic, intriguing, humorous, and educational. Loved the way he tied this altogether. An overall outstanding story.

B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Quite good.  Very correct and offhand.  Johnny Lee Miller's matter-of-fact portrayal of Sherlock Holmes is its own addiction.  Bravo to casting for Lucy Liu as Watson.
1451627297|2.0|I've read most of King's work, and found that over time he shifts from writing great stories to stories I can only describe as excercises in filling space, knowing it will sell. This is one of those books. He took a terrific plot idea and then wrote a long, boring book that was mostly about the main character's love affairs and his stalking of Oswald. The only part worth reading is the 50 or so pages where he actually tries to stop the assassination. Borrow from a friend, but don't spend your hard-earned money on this book.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a bad azz game I love it<br />It is easy and way better way then the first one

B008PZ69RU|4.0|360(released July/12) stars Sir Anthony Hopkins,Jude Law,Rachel Weisz and many others.It's a well done filmic study in characters whose paths are linked either directly or indirectly,and the differing paths their ultimate decisions take them on.The cast was well picked with all doing a solid job.<br />The story starts off with a young European lady at a photog's place of business.The man is really a photog/pimp.He puts up clients photos on the internet,filters the incoming calls and sends his beauties out into the world to make money for himself and them.Her first job as Blanka,is to meet up with Jude Law,a visiting businessman,at a bar.As he walks towards her he is stopped by two businessmen he had talked to previously,who now,of all times,want to accept his offer.Law tells them he is going to deal elsewhere.One of the men spies Blanka and starts to ramble on about her being a hooker,even getting her pic and name on his phone.Law,to avoid embarrassment,has to leave the bar and stand her up.Later that evening in his hotel room,Law gets a call from the businessman who actually met and paid her.She told him Laws name.Their business arrangement will now be renegotiated due to what he has on Law.<br />The scene switches to a dentist who has a thing for his assistant.He seeks help with his emotions with a therapist and his imaan.He even goes so far as to follow her to the airport.Law's wife,in the meantime,has had an on going affair with a young Brazilian photog who works for her company.Today she is having one last fling with him and ending her affair.The photog goes home only to find HIS Brazilian girlfriend has left him because of his affair with Law's wife.She flies back to Rio.Law returns home and both he and his wife are uncomfortable because of their individual personal problems that neither,of course,know about.The one thing they do have in common at this time is their young daughter.<br />The scene switches to a convicted sex offender and his case worker.Seems the six year jailed convict is being allowed out and is flying home by himself.He is quite uncomfortable with the prospect,but his case worker is there for him.On a flight over the U.S.,the Brazilian girl on her way to Rio meets up with elderly Hopkins.It turns out he is a recovering alcoholic and is going to Arizona to identify a body which may or may not be his daughter,who disappeared some years before.Stranded at Denver Airport due a snowstorm,the two decide to meet up later for a drink at a bar.Fate intervenes and she instead meets up with the convicted sex criminal.She ends up coercing him back to her hotel room,and he is clearly uncomfortable.Her advances drive him to lock himself in the washroom.When he finally comes out she is asleep.Hopkins,the next day,worried seeks the girl out when her flight is boarding.He finds her and they say their goodbyes.<br />Hopkins gets to his destination and finds the body is not his daughters.At an AA meeting that night he relates the background of his daughters disappearance(she may be alive).Also at that AA meeting is the dental assistant who is there visiting relatives.It seems her marriage is on the rocks and when she returns home she is telling her hubby it is all over.This she does,and just as he is leaving on a business trip.When she returns to work her conflicted boss tells her he has to let her go.Her hubby meanwhile has gone to the airport to meet his boss,who has some crime connections and is in town to to meet up with a girl he has lined up for him.It turns out the girl is none other than Blanka,but things don't go well.She calls her pimp who arrives and shoots the man,leaving Blanka at the scene unconscious.The hubby has watched things go down and flees the scene.Blanka's sister,who went along to every job with Blanka,had struck up a convo with the hubby earlier,and now decides to leave with him.Law's marriage has now recovered.And the film comes to its conclusion as we see all the major characters go across thescreen,all on the new paths they have chosen/made for themselves.<br />The last character study I recently saw was the Marigold Hotel,but unlike that,this one has its stars,but not to the same extent.Marigold's characters lives converged at the hotel,but here we have people from all over the world coming together in some way,shape or form,with some strand of commonality.I also found this movie far more satisfying than Marigold.The direction here is quite good,as is the editing to get all these divergent stories together to make a whole,coherent story.They also \\"play\\" with us a bit in this film.There is a moment when the sex offender is alone in the room with the girl flying to Rio.She is asleep and he is gently stroking her.The camera fades into next day and Hopkins is looking for her to say goodbye.We don't expect he will find her but he does.No,the violent moment is put off until Blanka sleeps with the criminal and it goes wrong.Nicely played.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp.Extras include three featurettes.<br />All in all a nicely done character study;well acted and directed.Recommended.screen,all on the new paths they have chosen/made for themselves.<br />The last character study I recently saw was the Marigold Hotel,but unlike

1451695195|1.0|This man has a huge god complex, he is nasty about people who have had NDE and says they are basically ignorant when they write their stories. His brain was never dead, his heart never died, there were parts of his brain still working or he would be dead or not remember anything. He was put on a venilator and sedated because of his illness and seizures. Top neurosurgeons in the world have confronted him and he finally admitted his brain was working or \\" It would have be leathal\\" Do your research before you believe all this mans nonsense. If this mans brains was dead or not working he would be a veg or dead and he would not remember anything if he was alive. Always research before you believe anything you read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is. Awesome. There are so many neat games on this and its a great way to challenge yourself.  I actually had my husband take my kindle and hide it from me because I was on it so much because of this thing. A big thumbs up for this one.
B0083DJWGO|3.0|I am a fan of NNT but he keeps circling the prey without pouncing so he can editorialize on his superior approach to life. I think the $1.99 condensed e-book format which is basically long form journalism would have worked better for this material.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Purchased this to watch as a family with my two kids ages 5 and 7. Very good story and hilarious. We love all the ice ages, and this may be the best one yet.

B00AREIAI8|1.0|this app is TERRIBLE when it comes to bugs. many people have issues with it crashing,  or just plain NOT LOADING AT ALL. the developers did a crap job. do not use it if you have a iphone or kindle. google this if you are skeptical of this review: &quot;my horse app crashes &quot; or &quot;my horse app won't load &quot;. TONS OF COMPLAINTS. THIS APP IS BUGGY AND SUCKS.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but to progress at a decent pace you need to spend real mony to but gems. I play quite a bit but slow progress.

B00A23MYCC|1.0|Was supposedly a funny movie.  It was much more stupid than funny.  Some of the scenes were painful to watch.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl is a novel that was recommended to me by Amazon and I also read good reviews about it elsewhere. It gives good insight into the minds of the protagonists, and how a failed marriage feels like. However halfway through the novel, it turns improbable and has twists and turns that do not blend very well into the main story line. And as several reviewers have pointed out, the ending is lackluster and leaves the reader with an unpleasant feeling.
B004J4WKUQ|2.0|I thought the book was very slow to start, but picked up once the game was afoot.  If I was more of a gamer I'm sure I would have enjoyed it more.
B0013D6LEM|5.0|He is the best. This is my favorite album. If you get this album you will not be dissipointed. I love it.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|Love the video games and was very exciting when the movies started to come out. The movies only follow the video game in some aspects but they are all still a good watch.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I have now read all three Hunger Games books and although I am not the direct target audience (young adult) I am disappointed with the last two books in particular. They are too brutal and not a joy to read. I do not understand why such books need to be written as in my opinion it amounts to senseless violence and there is enough of that on TV. I would not recommend these books to anyone.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  Stephen King has a great writing style and a breat story here!  I recommend this book for a good read.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book. I mainly started reading it because of all the hype. I have not seen the movie. I quite enjoyed the book although it can be a bit morbid and brutal at times.
034580404X|5.0|My trilogy came as advertised and I'm totally satisfied.  Besides saving money, it came very quickly and I didn't have to go to the big box store and purchase.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a fun and very addicting game! The graphics are better than a lot of other horse games. Definitely worth five stars!
B009FZFONO|5.0|How do the writers of Walking Dead do it?  This is the best season so far!  We are HOOKED!!!  This is by far our favorite television series EVER!
B00AVIPXKI|4.0|Enjoy the vampire genre, this one has a more detailed and imaginative back story for the characters, I found it very intriguing.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great read I highly recommend it<br />It's the final chapter of a great trilogy.  You should read them for  sure.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|the fight between batman vs superman was worth every penny. marvel wishes they can make epic movies like this. i got it for only 1299 here on amazon wow awesome...MAKE MINE DC
0062082353|5.0|I don't have much to say because I'm only on page 47. I like this person a lot. He doesn't write like a professional writer. He writes like a real person. Like somebody I would want to have a beer with.<br /><br />I had this book for a few weeks but didn't start reading it until after the terrible thing that happened recently. After all he went thru in Iraq he was killed in his own country by someone he was trying to help.<br /><br />So far it's a \\"can't stop reading this\\" book. He had a very interesting life even before he became a sniper.<br /><br />At pages 46 and 47 I have to quote what happened immediately after the 9/11/2001 atrocity. His cell phone had the message \\"Kyle, get your ass back to base. Now!\\" He started speeding down the highway at about 100 miles per hour. Of course a police officer stopped him and asked \\"Is there any reason you're going so fast?\\" Mr. Kyle explained why he was in hurry and said he was a SEAL. The police officer then closed his ticket book and said \\"I'll take you to the city line. Go get some ****in' payback.\\" They then went full speed out of that city.<br /><br />Buy this book. Especially if you love America and love the people who risk everything to defend us. You have to read this book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|a lot of the time I play this app all my worlds dissapear and the only thing there is the world before I built every thing. this makes real mad because I work really hard on my worlds. then when I go back to my world a day later its there again.
B007G92QGO|3.0|I've read lots of court room dramas in my time.  The synopsis of this book sounds good.  I found the story a chore to read.  The way it is written it's very hard to read.  The last few pages of this book were great.  Pity the rest of the book didn't flow as well as the last few pages.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I read the first books from John Grisham and after sometime I saw all his new books as the same book I read before. This book is in the Grisham model but it has a nice history construction and is very well written . Valid
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love in this game how u don't have to tip it like in temple run. and how when you change the setting there's always a different limited character.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun game! I strongly recommend this game.  The game would have gotten 5 stars since it takes to long to download.
B005HSL626|4.0|its not my favorite game because I don't like that when u r playing and u don't slice a fruit u lose a life.

B00003CXCQ|5.0|When it is found that the evil Queen is no longer the fairest in the land, the beautiful princess Snow White is forced from the kingdom and left to seek refuge in the woodland home of The Seven Dwarfs. She cooks and cleans for the rambunctious bunch, but it is not long before the Queen learns of her whereabouts and attempts to seal her in an eternal slumber using a poisoned apple. SNOW WHITE AND THE SEVEN DWARFS is a cinematic milestone, marking not only the first of Walt Disney's many feature-length animations, but also the first color feature and the first feature to use cel-animation. In animation, the difference is in the detail, and few films are more finely decorated or colorfully composed. SNOW WHITE may be filled with pleasant songs and cheery forest critters, but it also falls back on many of the darker story elements that have been taken from the Brothers Grimm. Here we have a children's story where an evil queen asks her servant to kill the princess and cut out her heart! Disney does nothing to censor the violence and terror in SNOW WHITE, though a note of German Expressionist influence can be seen through the use of light and shadow to imply many of the horrible acts. Walt Disney's initial foray into feature film is groundbreaking for establishing its many firsts, but it has become a screen classic thanks to its timeless tale and immaculate production.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Truly tells a story about a young woman who faces huge challenges both mentally and physically.  Kept me page turning to see what would happen next during her fantastic, life changing travels.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I have  read in a while! Colleen Hoover is definitely my new favorite author! :-)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I've seen all the movies and wanted to own the set for myself to watch over and over!  The only thing that would have made the set better would be if the movies were individually boxed instead of 8 cds in one box.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This product is sooo fun! But I warn u, this game is ADDICTING! I wish u could get more coins faster, though.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Pillars of the Earth is my 2nd favorite book of all time (To Kill a Mockingbird is #1 on my list.) Winter of the World is a masterpiece of historical fiction. I loved it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You have to get this game. The new Rio version is beast mode. GET IT!<br />I bet celebs have it.
B00005A1PR|5.0|you can never go wrong with an India Arie CD. her voice and lyrics are so refreshing. in a world where poeple sing about what they own and making it rain, she is a breath of fresh air.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it is a great game very challenging. it was hard at first but I got over it an than it got fun.
B000HGDWW0|5.0|Great watch - nice packaging - shipped right away.  This was a graduation gift and the item, packaging, presentation, timing etc. were all great.
B00008J2PG|5.0|Thank you so much for the DVD,  I remember watching this on TV when I was a young girl, I guess some 30 plus<br />years ago and didn't understand it fully but remembered its name for some reason. I always wanted to try and find it again so I could watch it and I really enjoyed the movie.<br />I am thinking of  buying another one to place into our Church Library for other to see.<br />Thank you so much, Sue
B009JNQ86Y|5.0|Love hearing her ballads. Really get to focus on her great quirky voice. Halcyon and Atlantis are great. I would rather have live back up vocals though and not the electronic. Great album.
0062238868|5.0|My second read of this amazing book. The news today saddened me. Having served myself this book hit home. RIP to an American hero.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|My mind was all over the place. Couldn't put it down. Holder and Sky were made for each other. Love it
0553386794|5.0|Picked up this book long ago. Put it down twice. Third time a charm. Perhaps one of my three favorite fantasy series of all time. Glad I tried again.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I think my title says it all.  Very fluffy, enjoyable music and theme (tradition can be upheld by being true to ourselves), laugh-out-loud moments, and solid one-liners!  Even my husband liked this movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Then I got the flu and and watched the entire first 2 seasons on Netflix while waiting to get better.  I was hooked! I loved it!  Great storyline, good writing, and well developed characters.  I couldn't  wait to watch the 4th season coming up so I bought this (3rd season) and  am streaming it without any problems and enjoying it  immensely!  Can't wait to see more.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Exactly what I ordered.  Dropped my phone, no problem.  Put it in water, no problem! Works like a champ. I totally recommend this product.
1571200851|4.0|This is a good fundamental book to start adding some texture and variety to your standard quilts. Techniques are well illustrsated.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game so much it opens when i tap on it i have no problems with it on my kindle
B0058BI864|5.0|Can't say much more than that. This is the funniest comedy currently on TV. Amazon way over charges for the digital distribution though.
B009YU62H2|4.0|This album was instantly one of my favorite Soundgarden Albums, and I really like Soundgarden. I was surprised at how much I liked it, I honestly wasn't expecting much, so it was a nice surprise.
B007N9FKCY|3.0|Bean only has one problem... he can't stop jumping. I bet this guy gets some lousy sleep and his roommates want to kill him. Other than an inability to stop bouncing around, this reminded me a lot of Mario Bros in that you go around collecting fruit (not coins) and landing on NPC's that go back and forth. Both fruit and NPC seem to exist for no other reason than to get Bean hopping and having things to shoot for or avoid. The maps are challenging enough and there are enough of them to keep you entertained for (literally) hours. Personally, I got bored with it after about four levels but if I stuck with it then I think it would have been worth the two dollars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find most helpful doing my devoations its very useful, easy to find scprictures thanks for letting me have access to this resource
B005UDD1R6|3.0|Well, this does pick up my DLNA server on both my Samsung S3 and my Kindle Fire. Video can be a little choppy at times and it doesn't seem to run several of the movies or shows I have on it. And, it crashes at times. I hope they can work these bugs out because when it does work, this app is pretty awesome!<br /><br />Despite its downfalls, this seems to be the best DLNA player out there at this time. Other plays I tries were more unstable or just didn't work.
B00005JXY3|4.0|While I enjoyed The Karate Kid Part II for the most part, it didn't have the punch (no pun intended) of the first film. In the first film, there was an intensity to it, as the high school kids and their cruel karate instructor plotted no mercy on Daniel. With this film, I think the objective was to get away from the 80s California scene with accompanying music and instead go with something more reflective of karate and its origins and culture. This film has more of a 'pure' feeling to it, and the viewer probably learns a bit more by seeing and assimilating karate and its culture. However, the underlying theme is the same: revenge. Another thing that struck me as somewhat odd was the overall lack of karate in it. It isn't until the very end of the film that something finally happens, and the intensity builds. Still, this movie has a good storyline, and the acting is superb. I recommend this film for those who don't mind a complete shift away from the look and feel of the first film.
B0051T47NQ|4.0|This Norwegian picture is slow at first but picks up with some interesting footages as it's delivered as a mockumentary. Tale follows a bunch of troll hunters (mostly students) who go into the deep wildlife to follow a trail of clues that seem to prove that trolls exist. One of the big highlights are the trolls which are fairly evocative for a low budget picture.<br /><br />Good job in keeping it with Norwegian folktales, especially in regards to there being different types of trolls. I liked the sunlight gun idea, too.<br /><br />Its mountain and lake scenes were filmed in Western Norway. This foreign film has English subtitles for those who don't want to do any reading.<br /><br />I got a recommendation for this picture from some of my Cthulhu gaming buddies so thanks, people.<br /><br />The Amanda Award gave this flick Public Choice Award and Best Visual Effects. There is serious talk of an American remake.<br /><br />Grading is based on a low budget flick. For those on the fence this is good, light fun with mild thriller/horror elements.<br /><br />STORY/PLOTTING/EDITING: B minus to B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B; CINEMATOGRAPHY (for mockumentary): B plus; CGI/SPECIAL EFFECTS: B plus to A minus; SOUND/MUSIC: B; FRIGHT LEVEL: B; OVERALL GRADE: B; WHEN WATCHED: early February 2013 (streamed).
0345803507|3.0|This entire series of books is just okay. It just isn't the greatest thing since sliced bread to me as I hear so many people say. I could go on & on about the things about the book that drove me crazy. The over use of words is very annoying. There are 7-10 words that are repeatedly used. Every page or every other pages contains the same 7 words. There are grammatical errors in the book (in all 3). The story line is ridiculous. The main character is a poor role model f/women. It was just not a great book. I'm glad I read it so I could see f/myself what it was all about. @ the same time, I'm glad it's over & I'm finished w/the series.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Brave was cute and sweet, but I was expecting Merida to be a little more bad ass. A bit too whiny and not enough take charge.
0439023491|5.0|After I finished this book, I thought to myself, if I had Book 3 I would read it all right now in one day. I was surprised this story line was something that would interest me. It's a great book that is very well written that really engages you from start to finish. I laughed when I saw the age group the book is geared towards. Let's just say, I'm a little older than the targeted age range. As much as I look forward to Book 3, it saddens me b/c I know it's the final book in the series. Excellent read!!
B0050SYS5A|5.0|love it! works really good just like they say it fits, i have no problem whit this item i recommend.
B0067EKY9K|5.0|Great movie!  I saw it first at the movie theater and wanted a copy for my own. I recommend it.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|good show.. really gives you a feel for a completely different way of life as well as well as how historical occurrances, like world war one, effected that way of life

1400052173|5.0|My first purchase and a Damn Good One.  I grow up hearing about her and reading about her.  I enjoyed the story.  Very sad.<br />Too, bad she was not born later maybe she could have been saved.  Too, many people have profited from her death.<br />Not her family or children.<br />Thank you!
1609611543|5.0|This book is an absolute eye-opener. Not being a fan of fad diets, and short cuts into weight loss, I was a skeptic of this book at first, but after reading what the Doc had to say, I wanted to give it a try.<br /><br />I am 35 years of age, and I've been a long time sufferer of IBS - I attributed my symptoms to stress, and working as an RN for so long, I figured my job was exacerbating my IBS symptoms.<br /><br />I recently changed careers, and although my symptoms had improved slightly, I would still have IBS attacks here and there. One day, after eating half a chocolate croissant, and having an IBS attack, I decided enough was enough, and I would read this book, and follow the recommendations.<br /><br />1 week later, I have lost almost 6 pounds, and my IBS symptoms - GONE.<br /><br />To give you some background on my health prior to trying this diet : I'm considered \\"fit to average in weight\\", exercise regularly, and typically ate a healthy diet of salads, sandwiches, and meat with vegetables  I even avoided cereal for a couple of years, and opted for the protein shakes in the morning with blueberries and almond milk. I also eat typically low carb foods, and try to generally stick to protein, veges, limited fruits, cheese, nuts, and so forth, but I still had a good amount of wheat in my diet, some that I wasn't even aware of consuming.<br /><br />My BMI was only 23 to start out, so I wasn't in the overweight category, but I could afford to lose roughly 10 more pounds. I'm not overweight by any means, but I wanted to lose that extra weight just to feel extra fit and healthy.<br /><br />Fast forward to 1 week later on this diet, and I feel LESS cravings, feel less tired and moody, am less foggy headed, and my IBS symptoms - completely GONE. My stomach always had those uncomfortable twinges of pain now and then, and I just \\"dealt\\" with it. I though it was my life sentence to just deal with it, and I managed it the best I could through exercise, diet, and stress management.<br /><br />My cramping, and any other painful symptoms related to IBS have completely vanished. I feel like someone literally gave me a new GI system, I feel that good. It's almost euphoric after feeling so awful for so long, and just tolerating it.<br /><br />I also forgot to mention that I started having arthritis in my wrists, and aches in my body in the past 2-3 months, and I attributed it to lack of sleep, stress and age related symptoms.<br /><br />Those symptoms - GONE after a week on this diet.<br /><br />You are reading the review of a skeptic, an RN who always ate a sensible diet, and always followed the rules of calories in and calories out. A person who exercises regularly, even ran 4-5 miles a day, 6 days a week at one point until my knees started hurting. Someone who routinely lifted weights, and was always health conscious. AND most importantly, someone who is NOT a fan of fad diets, and who always ate sensibly.<br /><br />Yup, I lost 6 lbs in just a week and I'm now only 5 lbs from my original goal weight of 140, which is very good for my frame since I tend to carry more muscle, especially in my legs.<br /><br />All you skeptics, all you non-believers, and those of you who hate fad diets, don't like the easy way out, and want to change your health, and your diet - TRY IT. I didn't believe it at first, but after being on this diet for a week, and even allowing myself one cheat day of a milkshake and fries, and still losing 6 lbs, I can't believe it.<br /><br />The best part is how GREAT I feel. I don't have cravings anymore, I don't care for wheat, and I want to eat healthy.<br /><br />I almost feel like tearing up, because I'm so frustrated that this discovery didn't come sooner. I have suffered from IBS for almost 10 years, and probably more, and just dealt with it.<br /><br />Little did I know that wheat was the culprit all along, and those so called \\"healthy\\" whole grain sandwiches were destroying any chance of feeling better, and being pain free.<br /><br />Try it for 30 days, I've only been on this a week and I can already tell you that I'm going to be a wheat free lifer.<br /><br />You will be amazed, astounded, frustrated, tearful, resentful, and happy all at the same time. It's an epiphany, and you will be overwhelmed with all these emotions once you discover that wheat has been the culprit all those years.

B001NLKXK2|5.0|This is a beautifully written and important book for all to read. While this is a topic that no one wants to discuss, these are discussions that need to be had. More importantly, seeing the progression of this disease through the eyes of Alice will give you the insight and empathy that we all need for those around us.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was completely out of shape when i started this 30 day workout. i am building strength and endurance with each workout.  someone ultra fit would probably need one of Jillian's more advanced dvd's.  i am so proud that i am sticking with this workout.  i give her the credit because the workouts are challenging but not boring. i have been unable to ride bicycle because i was so out of breath and tired.  my son and i went riding recently and i could keep up with him.  this dvd is available to view on YouTube if you want to check it out first. after watching it on YouTube and trying it out, i had to purchase my own copy of it.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abby is one of the best series ever shown on TV, certainly the very best that is being offered today. It is so refreshing to see that someone is still producing  quality programming today.<br /><br />I have now caught up through last night's 3rd season episode. This week's episode was one of the best and certainly the most heart wrenching episode so far.  The series profiles the best and the worst of our human experience--our actions and the changes life brings us.<br /><br />If you have not seen any of the series, PLEASE view them from the first episode of the first season. If you are an Amazon Prime member, the streaming is free through Season 2. If not, i recommend you purchase the first couple of episodes to see if you like the series. If so, you can decide if you like the series. You can purchase each season to download to your PC or iPad, etc. you can purchase the entire season at a better price than choosing each episode separately. All 3 seasons can now be purchased on DVD. Season 3 is over 1/2 over, and you can only purchase only the episodes shown thus far of Season 3. At the end of the season all episodes will be available for free streaming with Prime membership, but if you love it, you will want to purchase the entire series for future viewing. I am now watching every episode thus far in order. You will see many things that you missed the first time, or you will understand what is important, knowing the results.<br /><br />All in all, this is the best series being offered today! I would give it 12 stars if more than 5 were offered!
B005URRCUY|3.0|I bought it for the songs played on the radio and those were really the only ones I liked............the rest were just ok
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I liked this book for the ease of reading, for the message it sends, and for the characters it portraits. I makes me want to go and see the movie to see how they will interpret and bring the message across. A love story with a little twist, even if you think you have it all figured out :-)
B0072IVGZG|4.0|Im always excited when the Cult Records it is Good but they just cant seem to grab the pump of Sonic Temple though....................
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My family and I cannot get enough of this show. We just love it.  We do find it odd that every time there is a pregnancy, there is some sort of tragedy that comes from it.  Either the child dies or a parent dies or someone is abandoned.  I was disappointed with the coverage of Mary's wedding. We watched her romance with Matthew over two whole seasons and we were all excited for the wedding in season three. With such a long build up I assumed the start of season 3 would be a lavish wedding. The wedding was over in the blink of the eye. No reception, no dancing, no fun conversations. That was odd too. Nonetheless we still tune in and still give the show a 5 star rating.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I hate the ending, but that does not take away from my enjoyment of reading these books :)  Very good!
0440237688|5.0|Chose the rating because I liked the book and its subject meatter<br />Was so good I read it in a day<br />The book was quirky enought to keep me interested<br />Book is not good for young teenagerss.<br />Better for adults
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great book, nice twist at the end.  Now I can't wait to see the movie when it comes out!  :)
0756405890|5.0|A little slow to start, but well worth reading.  By the time I finished this book, I was hooked.  Couldn't wait to get started on the next!
B007SGM084|5.0|I read them all 2x in a row...considering another read.  I became very attached to these characters!  I of course would recommend these books to anyone!  Soooo good!  :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I pull this out all the time - very basic but super helpful when you need to calculate something in the store or whereever you have your kindle.
B000SP1SEO|4.0|Although I hadn't heard of this before I watched it (the all star cast was intriguing), it was really entertaining. Brad Pitt was amazing as a gypsy, complete with gypsy dialogue. Definitely recommend!
B001CDZZI6|5.0|My boss had me purchase this to take the assessment and then use the results to develop my development plan for the upcoming year.  I enjoyed the assessment and results report.  I was pleased that this was available on the Kindle.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I enjoyed the movie but thought that the ending was anticlimatic? Felt like it ended at a good halfway point. It just left me thinking &#34;where is the rest of the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app before the most recent update and it just keeps on getting better and better.  I LOVE THIS APP!!
B003Y059EK|1.0|The yellow brick road has been destroyed. The munchkins are dead. The Tin Man, Cowardly Lion and Scarecrow are turned to stone, replaced by an annoying Pumpkin Head man, Jack. Dear Auntie Em has taken Dorothy for ELECTRO SHOCK THERAPY because of her tales of Oz, and Toto is replaced by a talking CHICKEN. No, no, NO...<br /><br />And even with all that, I think I illogically got miffed the most that the princess got the Ruby slippers, which I feel rightfully belong to Dorothy.<br /><br />The ONLY cool thing was the wicked queen who could change heads to change moods, but her mionions on the skates were just stupid. I didn't read the other Oz books, but... ::shudder:: This was just horrific.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|this game is fun and relaxing to play when your not doing anything<br />I have this one and the first one
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Many many enjoyable hours playing this...addictive. I play each night before bed. Very relaxing yet fun to try to beat my previous score. Would recommend it highly<br /><br />Teddylucygigi@gmail
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game. It's good for people who liked to be challenged.But keep updating it. Next you should have it in a desert scene. Well thanks for making this game! ~Sierra
B0018AZWTA|5.0|a highly underrated Yes album.I am a camera.into the lens. jon anderson may not be present but a great album none the less
0143034901|5.0|Zofon's writing makes me swoon. Very interesting tale, punctuated by beautiful descriptions. I was happy to soak up time getting lost in this different plot!
B00992CF6W|3.0|The game is fun, but Mojang, on my Kindle Fire the version is 0.5.0 and on my friend's i pod Touch it's version 0.6.1.  I can't join his server when playing because mine is &quot;outdated.&quot;  Please update the Kindle Fire version.
B0000A5BT1|1.0|I thought I was purchasing this timeless classic as a present for my dad. When he put it in the DVD player, there was a message saying that it was the Wrong Region--and wouldn't play for him! (He lives in Florida, USA) Apparently, movies have different &#34;regions&#34; and this particular one plays in the UK or something like that. So, no movie and now I'm out the $$ I paid for it. I tried to contact the seller but they sent me an email back with a bunch of mumbo jumbo--basically I'm going to have to jump through hoops to send back the one I bought and purchase one that's the &#34;right region.&#34;<br />(It is a wonderful movie though so hopefully if you purchase this, you get a copy with the right region and a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|yet again they make a great game. downloaded it on my phone and my I phone. my sons tablet also
B007IXWKUK|5.0|this book was so capitaving that i was unable to put it down. The interest in the young ladys life  was unbelieveable
B004SBS8LA|1.0|You're kidding me! I need to keep spending to play this game? Greed is an obvious intent here. Done with greedy birds!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I downloaded the FREE trail version for my 4yr niece over her weekend stay and I have to say my husband and I have also enjoyed it! :)
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Visually, this was a stunning film with adequate to very good acting. Unfortunately, the story leaves you wanting. Some would call it predictable, but I can live with predictable as long as the film making allows me to immerse myself into the environment. Too many questions were raised that remain unanswered (and I don't think it was deliberate) and the action scenes could have been delivered by phone.<br /><br />Michael Fassbender's androidal take of Peter O'Toole's Lawrence of Arabia is goose bump inducing.<br /><br />And kudos to the film for the fastest recovery from a  self-inflicted abdominal laparotomy I've ever seen. [insert eyeroll]
B0086700CM|5.0|I just love this app, I have it on my cell phone as well.  My daughter had it on her phone and I just had to get it. I put it on my kindle too, it works great no glitches.
B005PR44XC|3.0|I have read all his books and generally loved them all, except or this one. Unlike The Big Short which revealed the underpinnings if the GFC this one glosses over the surface and gave me no great insights or conclusions. Still highly readable but not classic Michael Lewis
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Even better then the first, like the upgrades too. Have a hard time putting it down, it is well worth what I paid for this game. Have it on cell phone too.
1449410243|5.0|LOVE THIS BOOK! I brought it to work to show my other co workers who also have cat children and they are going to buy a copy too.  Everyone who flipped through it giggled.  I bought one to send to my dad.  WARNING: DO NOT GO TO THE THEOATMEAL.COM WEBSITE AND READ THE CAT COMICS ON THERE.  Those are published in the book and there are new ones included.  I went to the website after I ordered this book and read a lot of the comics on there which are awesome.  Even though I had seen some of the comics already online, they're soo good you don't mind too much reading them again in the book.  theoatmeal.com website though does have many other comics on various topics that are LOL so definitely visit but resist to read ALL the kitty comics.
B000C13Y2S|4.0|Good little light. It will probably come in handy when I am working on various projects, it is small and very portable.
0823016714|3.0|The book is a great idea in terms of being a great source of different facial expressions of the same face, but the photographic quality is lacking. The photos are in black and white, which is a great idea, but there's flatness to the lighting of the faces, there's not enough contrast created by the lighting.
0307891402|5.0|Recomend to all who want to play the total game.This has all the info about all the quests you could ever want.
B000026KGC|5.0|Not that The Book is without flaws - it was a hurried production and two of the three covers (We Can Work it Out and Kentucky Woman) are lackluster. The third (River Deep, Mountain High) is mightily pretentious, but is highly entertaining none-the-less. The rest of the album portends the emergence of one of the greatest bands of all time. Best of all, this is a truly high quality recording, unlike the half-hearted previous releases. A definite must-have for diehard Deep Purple fans.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this story, it was pure fiction of the fairly unbelievable kind but it was a good read. The story was fairly predictable however if you are looking for an easy read then this one is good. Great for a beach or holiday novel.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I recommend this book if you are interested in knowing the thoughts that were going on in Anne's mind throughout her hiding in the annex. Anne actually states several times that she wanted to be a journalist and writer when she grew up..Her diary is written really well which leads me to believe she would have been a great writer.
1616550414|5.0|While there may be some who would be surprised by the secrets that the book reveals, for a serious fan, it's just amazing how much the little things click into place once you delve into it.  A quality book in both content and construction, this is a MUST have for anyone.  Legend of Zelda, Nintendo, Videogame, and Art fans especially will find something to appreciate here.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Very addictive and easy to play. Wish you didnt have to start from the beginningg<br />each time. Three lifes per game would be fantastic.
0307887448|5.0|Born in 1976, I guess I am a true \\"geek.\\"  I can not remember the last time I had so much fun reading a book and each page felt like a trip back to any given day of my childhood.  What other piece of literature will ask you to think about interpersonal skills, pacman, Atari, indentured servitude, D & D, montey python and more all in the same work.  Do not deprive yourself of this great book.  I just wish the author had a follow-up ready.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|Love fun time turner it can make time disappear I dont like having to buy more stuff to play forward
B007THA4FI|1.0|very disappointed. after the rousing success and enjoyment of Harry potter, Rowling simply tried too hard with too little on this one.
B000F3UAFC|5.0|In my opionion I wish they would make many movies like these I have intered.  This was an excellent movie and will watch over and over.
034580404X|5.0|These books are a good read when you have extra time.  It is a light and fast reading fantasy.  recommended
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I enjoyed this movie and will indeed watch it over and over.  I am glad they will still make movies that doesn't have only in mind the very young.  We older adults like good movies that are not trashey.  Thank you for making possible.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|This is a pretty huge step forward from the first game except for the persistent crashes on the Kindle Fire. Losing those long runs when you try to continue is infuriating!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved the book.kept me enthralled and can't wait to read the next book to continue on the journey..who will be the one?
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this app and it worked for a day and now I cant even get into the app!!!!!uuugggg!!!!!don't buy this appif you have a kindle fire.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My cousin and I played this so long my hand hurt from moving the screen; literally played all day. We actually built a city. This game is awesome and I strongly recommend. Updates take a few days longer than other appstores, but I'm a big girl and can wait. ;)
B003L77G6A|5.0|Season 4 the Big Bang Theory gang is just hitting their stride. My favorite all time episode is on this season, (episode #2) where Sheldon turns himself into a robot via a &#34;virtual presence device.&#34; Jim Parsons is pure genius...
B002PHVHFI|5.0|I love this album, every song is great even the weird ones in fact the weirder the better. buy it
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I am who I am ,because of \\" The Beatles\\".Number Nine,NumberNine,Number Nine. \\" the Watusi the twist. Eldorado\\".Id rather. See you dead little girl if I catch  with a nother man.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I brought this game for my three year old son and he love it. I even caught myself playing it. This game is fantastic. I love it
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not one of his best books.  Good though, but just okay.  Not a page turner.  I was a little disappointed.
B000059GEI|5.0|What a cast - What Music, and what great Dancing by Donald O'Conner amd Mitzi Gaynor..They don't make them like this anymore!!...And if you like Mitzy Gaynor - Get her Special DVD, &#34; Clips from her TV Shows&#34;
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book started off intriguing, it turned to a who dunnit and turned out awful.  Will not read any other books by Flynn, it was that disappointing.
1439153663|5.0|loved this book from the start! If you liked The Help you will love this. I am in a book club of 12 women and we all loved it.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I know this movie is probably predictable and cheesy, but I loved it!  I really like a romance and the characters are so easy to root for!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Every time I get to a high point in the game, the game freezes and shuts down. Therefore I don't get my high score or the coins I earned. I had 4 million with 6,000 coins that I got jipped out of.<br />Otherwise I love this game and it is a great change!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|Super funny movie for the family. The main &#34;bad guy&#34; bird says some things that you might not want your kids to repeat (like shut up and stupid), but other than that it is enjoyable for the WHOLE family.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Who doesn't love a little adult Christmas humor? This move is light hearted and easy to watch. Rent it now!
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I was skeptical after being disappointed by two other FB apps for Android, but this one worked right out of the gate providing full features ala Facebook.com.<br /><br />If you're looking for a no muss-no fuss FB app for your Droid tablet or smartphone, look no farther.  It's free, so what have you got to lose?
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I didn't like any of the characters and wondered if those parents had their heads planted firmly in the sand. How could they live with Jacob and not realize his character, or lack thereof??? I would not recommend this book to a friend.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|Of all the Christmas Carol movies, this is one of my favorites with the Muppets and Michael Caine.  He plays the part of Scrooge so well.  He holds his own with those adorable Muppets.
0689835604|5.0|Great kids book. My son is 18 months and loves the flaps on each page. One of his favorite books.  Easy for him to understand and follow along with
B0039UTDFG|3.0|I loved the footage but I did not like the promotion of evolution. I enjoyed watching this with both of my children, ages 11 and 10.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I liked this mostly because of it being an autobiography. He wrote and explained for all to enjoy.  Chris and his company were so brave it's a shame, they were killed at a local public shooting range &#34;just because&#34;.
B000MRAAJM|4.0|I enjoyed this video - the footage was great. However, I have also watch the Segournie Weaver version and I think I like her voice better. Very informational and fascinating!! I would recommend this to my friends.
B00170I7GG|5.0|Since I love It's a Wonderful Life, it makes sense that I love this movie. It's all about the &#34;what if's&#34; of a life, only this happens in Punxatawny PA and is the repetition of a day and what a person would do with that. I watch it annually.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I should have read this before the holidays; before the movie was released.  But my life is a little crazy between October and December, so oh well.  I downloaded this in January and am still reading it slowly.  Earlier reviews advise not skipping over the chapters that develop the priest and his role in Jean Valjean's life.  I'm glad that I was prepared for that because the chapters detailing the priest and his background is crucial to the story.  Yes, it is a long read, but a good one if you like reading the books that musicals and movies are based on.  I definitely recommend this.
0062231375|3.0|He's into cooking and cooking shows.  Likes Bourdain because he's sacastic and names names.  Not for actual cooking but OK for the gossip.
B008MEM24S|4.0|and he's not even a gamer...a fun game but needs more levels or to be a little more challenging. On to star wars angry birds...
0375869026|5.0|Really provides good discussion for middle schoolers and judging others.<br />The idea of seeing past deformities and showing how one copes with living with a disfigurement that can't be hidden is quite brave.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|there is nothing i could say about this show that isn't already known. one of the best shows on tv.
B001FB563E|5.0|I had forgotten how good this movie is. We saw this at the theater during its original release. I thought it was marvelous, but I was fresh off the book and a little disappointed at the minor liberties taken with the story.<br /><br />I ended up purchasing the Blu-ray and then did not watch it for months. I recently put it in.<br /><br />It is hard not to think about the current crop of &#34;Academy&#34; nominated films and other highly rated films of the last year, while watching this.<br /><br />While The Road somewhat softened the written hammer of the book, this is nonetheless a powerful, well acted film. This film puts to shame several of the films nominated the year it was released, and continues to stand above many that have come in its wake. It is dark, it is painful, it is not fun and will not make you &#34;feel good.&#34; At the same time, few films in the modern era so realistically capture human ingenuity, strength and the familial bond amidst circumstances nearly beyond comprehension. The music is haunting and appropriate, the cinematography astonishing, the acting superb and the road hard and long, yet ultimately beautiful and rewarding.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B005VPRETE|5.0|very good packaging and quality of legos are always good.<br /><br />make sure you keep up with these things, stepping on them will make you cry.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|always glitches. but its pritty fun nice feachers way better than 1st one.it works better with wifi. but still its fun.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|there is nothing i could say about this show that isn't already known. one of the best shows on tv.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome its great anyone who says it is not is wrong I highly reconnmend it just totally awesome
B002RI9YCI|5.0|Beautiful writing, an original conceit and a story that could really be about any of us. This is a delight.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Amazon Instant Video and the new TV Pass is great. Thanks for the technology that makes my winters so much brighter.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I enjoy puzzles. This game has a large variety and a challenging aspect that keeps me and my step dad interested for hours. It also helped me and my family pass the time waiting in line for an hour at the air port and everyone liked it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really loved this book. I highly  recommend it. Lots of mystery. I couldn't stop reading it. I read it everyday until I was done.
B0085YNML2|3.0|It's ok, but it wasn't interesting for very long. I wish there was something more to the levels. I looks more fun than it turns out to be.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I found it too pricey as Bartells Drug had it for $5.95 for two. So guess where I will shop next time.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I would have given this five stars but when I went to school it crashed and I couldn't access it even when I was in an area with free wifi. I haven't found a solution either. Fun but now inconvenient.
B000FC12YQ|4.0|This is pure Christie.  Many of the elements of the mystery novel are here:  the secluded island, the red herrings, suspicious characters, and a terrific build-up of suspense.  I didn't know who the culprit was until nearly the end of the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|A real page turner, once you start reading it you will not be able to put it down. Grisham does it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I especially enjoyed how Peeta's character was explored and given depth in this book.<br /><br />Finnick was definitely the scene-stealer, though... that Tribute Parade outfit!<br /><br />I have read it seven time and expect to read it several time more.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I could not wait to see what was going to happen next. I could have finished it in a few hours if I didn't work and have a child. I would like to read more about them.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The best thing I can say about this book is that it is the end of the series.<br /><br />Once you finish this book, two things will be certain:<br /><br />1)You'll be in tears<br />2)You'll want to inflict bodily harm on Suzanne Collins for the ending.<br /><br />It's obvious the author had no attachment to main characters by the end of the book- or at least it certainly felt like it.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Just what I was looking for, hubby big fan of John Wayne, will be the perfect gift for his B-day
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think that subway suffers is the best game ever!!!!!!!! First time I got this game it was amazing ya.
B00683JK9K|2.0|There is not enough puzzles for the amount I paid for it and I think they could have done better. Maybe give some free upgrades are something. I just don't like it. Wish I had not waste my money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I can not stop playing. Best app I have and will ever have. I like the power ups. Better than temple run I recommend this.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|It was a great book, and the end makes you want to read the next right away!! It was fantastic!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My friend showed me this game and I do not even know what I would ever do without her its awesome.
B009Z59ZNE|5.0|First, an important note: Amazon has a policy of grouping ALL reviews of a particular title - including prior releases and non NTSC versions - together so it is important, when reading reviews here, to see the date of the review (often best to sort by date of review) and the particular version (DVD, BD and even VHS!). That said, on to my review.<br />Though released on DVD years ago, BBC Home video remastered the series (actually three separate four part stories) for this newest release on DVD and BD. (I can't speak for the BD as I got the DVD, but the image is sharp and the bonuses are the same.). With all the other reviews of the previous releases already here on Amazon (120 so far!), I will not go into the details of the show - except to say that I really liked the first and second seasons better than the third - though Ian Richardson is brilliant in all three. Let me concentrate on the \\"new material\\".<br /><br />The 2013 release comes with 4 DVDs. Each of the first three contains the four episodes of that  season plus a \\"commentary track\\" for Episode ONE. I have not listened to all three \\"commentaries\\" yet but I did listen to the one for Season One (\\"House of Cards\\". This includes a new \\"group commentary\\" featuring Richardson, Screenwriter Andrew Davies and the series Producer\\". It covers the full First Season and so there are spoiler alerts and I recommend that you do not hear the commentary until you have watch the rest of Disc One. But the info provided really fleshes out some of the story. The fourth DVD is marked \\"Bonus Features\\" and includes two programs. First is an excerpt from a British TV talk show about the controversy caused by Season 2 \\"Two Play the King\\". This lasts 8 minutes. The other \\"bonus\\" is a 51-minute film \\"Westminster: Behind Closed Doors\\" made for the BBC in 1995, giving a backstage tour of Westminster Abbey. I found this interesting though it doesn't really relate to the drama series.<br /><br />As you probably already know, the original \\"House of Cards\\" was produced in 1990 so you will note two things: 1) This was before the advent of Digital TVs and so the image aspect is the standard one (4:3) and not wide screen.2) Because PCs were in their infancy, you will note no cell phones and the monitors in the newspaper's newsrooms are monochrome CRT displays (remember those?).<br />I was not aware of this BBC Series until this release (I missed it when it aired on PBS) so I'm glad I found it now.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"\\"House of Cards\\" was produced in 1990 so you will note two things: 1) This was before the advent of Digital TVs and so the image aspect is the standard one (4:3) and not wide screen.2) Because PCs were in their infancy, you will note no cell phones and the monitors in the newspaper's newsrooms are monochrome CRT displays (remember those?).<br />I was not aware of this BBC Series until this release (I missed it when it aired on PBS) so I'm glad I found it now.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00634GHJA|2.0|It may work great for transferring photos to a computer but I was trying to move pics from the computer to an android phone. I had to replace an sd card on a new phone so I transferred the pics from the old sd card to the computer then wanted to transfer them back to the phone. I installed the app to the phone and followed the instructions within the app which sent me to the website to download the windows app to my computer which I did. Both computer and phone have to be on same wifi. Once they were, the phone app instructed me back to the website where it would let me move one pic at a time. I had 472 pics to move. I gave up on the app and with a few setting changes ended up using the usb cord and windows media to move them back. I spent at least an hour trying to figure out the app and trying to make it work and all of 10 minutes moving the pics with the usb, including setting adjustments.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It held my attention and I enjoyed the story line. Read it all in about two sittings, couldn't put it down.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|The game is repetitive and may seem mindless at first but I found myself not being able to get past a certain level, then I got annoyed. The strategy is to clear the level by firing the ball like a cannon ball at the balls above matching at least three to clear. The o next is to clear the level with as few &#34;cannon&#34; balls as possible. Harder as it goes on.
B002RI9UBS|4.0|An engaging read that is both entertaining and thought provoking.<br />A simplistic story with hidden messages - less is more!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The show is odd but I love it! I have cable and can watch shows after they air but they weren't updating them. Amazon instant video is the only place I could find it.<br />You have to like sci-fi. Aliens, serial killers, monsters, an asylum setting with the criminally insane, persons unjustly institutionalized, demons, the angel of death, etc. It sounds very strange but it weaves it all together in a very interesting way that makes it not seem strange. I just HAD to keep watching.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I must say this is one of the most enjoyable reads I've had a in a long while.<br />The premise of being left alone in such a place and being able to come up with a means of survival was great.<br />It's use of technical prose without being to nerdy is particularly well done, and having the character more than a little wise crack-y adds some depth.<br />It's a reluctant hero, but a hero to himself.<br />It's sort of rushed at the end, but I guess I didn't want it to.<br /><br />Rob
B002VHI8FE|5.0|This was an excellent book. It was fast-paced and absorbing, and had an engaging storyline. But most of all, I was impressed by the level of detail in Abercrombie's character development. The internal dialogue written to explain each main characters thoughts and ideas really made this book (and its cast) come alive. The characterization really added to the realism of the book. Most modern fantasy has ditched the stark black/white, good/evil stick figures that populate much of the \\"high fantasy\\" of yesteryear, and has replaced them with characters that are considerably more rounded and lifelike. For instance, most people are not completely good or completely evil. Humans tend to be basically self-interested and consumed with their own needs, desires, priorities, and goals. The genius of Abercrombie's characterization is that he seems to build each character from the inside out -- letting us see and recognize each cast  members'  understanding of their self and their world, to perceive each person's internal motivations. In short, they seem like real people. I loved this book and the characters in it.
B0074QGGK6|4.0|I was at first surprised at the thinness of this book (metaphorically, as I got the e-book), but enjoyed the fast-paced reading and enough &#34;zingers&#34; to make me want to stop reading and start creating!  Inspiration is wherever you find it and only matters if it leads to action.  This book is a catalyst for some of that!
B007ZI06FE|5.0|This was a wonderful wonderful book.  I absolutely couldn't put it down.  I love the steampunk theme intertwined with the vampire theme.  I cannot wait for the next book, werewolves beat vamps any day!!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Great HD movie, Interesting time traveling concept, and  PLENTY machine gun action.<br /><br />PLOT SPOILER:<br /><br />Much as I love BRUCE WILLIS, I dislike that he killed children for his own good.
0307341550|5.0|The best of the three books that she wrote ,this one really brought every component together for the final stop in the story,with an avenue for a follow up book
B00992CF6W|5.0|awsome but they need to make it easy for tnt to blow up  i cant get it to blow up
0307341577|5.0|Good as it gets safari as I can see,I like the way the story brought the reader on a great journey
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i love this game its easy to play and its a fun game to play when i have free time
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book, with a lot of detail about the raid and what went into it.  All hype and criticism aside, I would recommend this book to everyone.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great talent, love the album. Macklemore & Ryan Lewis are both amazing artists and the issues they deal with are admirable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game helps me pass the time waiting for transportation.  I enjoy solitare and this is one of the better ones I have found.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|What a fun movie especially if you are a Channing fan! Can't wait for the next one to come out!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|My grandson loves these games, he is only 3.  He plays them repeatedly, keeps him entertained for long periods of time
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It's a good app. Both my daughter and myself use this app. If you need a calculator get this app.
B005K17RU0|4.0|It is not excellent but fine to use in your everyday necesities. If you want some fine app for free this is for you.
B00002N9ER|5.0|This is my second set of these mounts. Just as you would expect and they hold the flashlight very tight.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Was fun movie and music was very well done!!<br />If your sitting home on a Saturday night nothing on TV choose this!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Downloaded this item without a hitch.  Everything went great!  Wish I was given moree than 48 hours to watch it at that price though.
B001EC3JME|5.0|I am a firefighter and always carry a small flashlight on my side.  This holster is a perfect fit and will hod most sizes out there.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was ok.  Interesting but I didn't love it - felt like it was broken in half to a fault.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|Not very hard to do, but keeps shutting off on my Kindle Fire sand restarting a step or two back from where I was. Other then that it's well okay... Others have been much better.
B0062LU85S|5.0|They did a great job with this compilation of songs for the movie.  Consistent across all the tracks.  Recommended for sure.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is SO much fun! It's amazing, addictive, challenging, relaxing, and you can play as little or as long as you want, since each game is short.
B008XG1X18|4.0|good app, better than not being able to log on for sure; but not as easy as doing it on the computer.
B008N1V11U|5.0|The graphics are awesome!!!  My 8 yr old would play this all day if I let him.  I'd recommend this game for sure for kids who love this superhero!
B000YMM3CC|2.0|It was a very easy process ot purchase the movie, which I did on my computer, and then watch it from my Playstation, however the movie was just way to depressing for my taste. I don't like overly sad movies and this was a love story, but to not a happy one in my opinion. If you want to cry watch this movie, it will without a doubt fit the bill in that way.
1451627297|5.0|This is one of Stephen King's best, it is a riveting tale that keeps you on the edge of your seat. It is a thriller but you begin to care about the characters as well. I actually cried at the end!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|nice picture and a few variations on a timer game. I like that you can buy gear and other things for the horses. the downside?  its a little slow paced and doesn't seem to follow much of a story line.
B00AXVH8KQ|4.0|The kids these days, I tell ya.  They're obsessed with the past so much that they make a career out of ransacking the stoner dude's record collection from next door and cutting their hair to look like `Ruby Tuesday'-era Mick Jagger and add that snotty swagger of Blonde On Blonde-era Dylan to their still developing vocal prowess. Foxygen are the current purveyors of the past, and after a few listens through of We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors Of Peace & Magic it's safe to say they've done their homework in Classic Rock 101. First off, let me say that this album has grown on me. Whenever an album is so blatantly (insert period of music here) I tend to step back a bit before I decide if I'm gonna find it an album I'll return to and enjoy. At first this record felt like a great collection of lost 60s hits from bands like The Kinks, The Velvet Underground, The Rolling Stones, and to some extent Bob Dylan. It was a fun listen, but one that I was sure would end up at the bottom of the pile for those `once in a blue moon' rainy day spins. Well, after a few more listens I feel safe in saying that Sam France and Jonathan Rado are doing more here than raiding a musty record collection and emulating their musical obsessions.<br /><br />`In The Darkness' opens the record with a Magical Mystery Tour sound, in particular that ramshackle masterpiece's `Hello, Goodbye'. Then `No Destruction' comes in with a Bob Dylan swagger in France's vocal and a care-free stoned vibe in the music that makes you instantly want to keep driving on that morning commute to work. Head to the nearest big city, smoke unfiltered cigarettes, and walk the sidewalks all day till someone calls looking for you. This is in the key of Blonde On Blonde, baby. `On Blue Mountain' has a refrain in it once the drums come in that is reminiscent of the Stones' `Under My Thumb', had MGMT written it and recorded it on Oracular Spectacular. You know, for all the classic rock ghosts that haunt Foxygen's sound, one modern band that I see as their kindred spirits would be MGMT. Had MGMT been more into weed than LSD,  I think Foxygen is what they would've sounded like.<br /><br />But I digress. Back to the album.<br /><br />If you close your eyes during `San Francisco' you swear you were hearing something off of the Kinks' The Village Green Preservation Society, complete with `Phenomenal Cat' flutes and a ghostly female vocal singing \\"That's okay, I was bored anyway\\", in answer to France's line \\"I left my love in San Francisco\\". Flute, vibes, strings in the background, this is a classic baroque pop gem that Ray Davies would gladly call his own. `Shuggie' has a great melancholy sway to it, and I think shows Foxygen at their least derivative. Like, if you had to go through and find that one song that could one day encapsulate what Sam France and Jonathan Rado `do', this song would be it. It must also be noted that the production on this record by Richard Swift is perfect. It's not lo fi by any means; it's aged. It's lush without being shimmering. It fits Foxygen's aesthetic perfectly.<br /><br />So what you have here on We Are The 21st Century Ambassadors Of Peace & Magic is a couple guys barely out of their teens making one hell of a musical statement. They're thumbing their noses at modern music, Brooklyn, and anyone else that ever told `em they'd never go anywhere. Sam France and Jonathan Rado have made a record that acts as a love letter to the brothers Davies', Jagger and Richards, and Reed and Cale; and as a jumping off point to finding their own voice and place in rock `n roll history. Just don't look for any Foxygen gigs at the Music Hall of Williamsburg anytime soon.n band that I see as their kindred spirits would be MGMT.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to play, and educational.<br />The game could use some more show options and ability to earn gems without spending money.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|My granddaughter loves this app!! It can be a fun app to run during a party or full room. Lots of laughs
B008YWY0HK|5.0|A good movie to watch with your children, although adults are welcome.  Even my 12 year old grandson, who lives actions movies, was impressed.  Definitely a good addition to my collection.
B00785P2QC|2.0|love the game so many things to build and new stuff added all the time takes awhile to build up invest points though
B009JBWOU0|5.0|This DVD trilogy is so awesome, it even comes with an excerpt from the book 'The Art and Making of The Dark Knight Trilogy'. It's a really good purchase for an already great movie, and it's nice to have a trilogy set.
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Brings back the memories of playing air hockey at arcades.  Easy to play and follow game.  Great choice for your kids.

B009G78EE2|5.0|Thought most of the songs would be like thrift shop, hip hoppy, n a little techno. But to my surprise, there are some very beautiful melodic Donna, and even an instrumental.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|These guys are hilarious, I thought it was stupid at first, but then it got better after about 15 minutes.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|Has all the functions of the regular website so I can plan my trips or review places I have been, on the go!
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Just watch it, the main theme is love and commitment, as well as some great cultural jabs at laziness and inconsideration.
0765325950|5.0|After having spent so much time with these characters I am so sad to see them reach the last book in the series. But, I really enjoyed the ride! What else can I say that others have not said? Well, I stayed uo to 3 pm to finish this tonight as I just couldn't sto reading! That is a testimony to exciting writing thank you Robert Jordan and Brandon Sanderson. I have loved this series!
B004NELBPC|5.0|I like it. I have no problems with this app. It's free. No complaints. I like this news media.  Huffington Post is great!
034580404X|3.0|Despite this kind of literature is &#34;light&#34;, this trilogy is very entertaining. If your are looking for serious literature don't read them, but if you want to keep the twilight line, read it, but you will have sex freaks instead of vampires.
0393039765|5.0|This book is a one of kind, once in a lifetime style of book, I love it! I've readit three times!

B004OR199G|5.0|A crazy sexy book that makes you feel good! Kris Carr is very inspiring and I love how she writes 😀
B0027MJU00|5.0|Deep, dark and graphically written with a twist you don't see coming. I felt every feeling being conveyed. Not a feel good book but worth it!
6305428387|5.0|The movie was great, I watch it all the time,  and it was sent to me in a reasonable amount of time.
B008OHV5C8|3.0|I love The Bad Plus. They are one of the few bands for which I have bought a copy of every CD they have made. Made Possible really feels like it picks up where Never Stop left off. The band are still pushing, still trying new things, but I'm not yet convinced by the inclusion of electronic sounds here....and the writing just doesn't feel as strong as earlier records...is this the band 'maturing'? If so, I hope they all hit midlife crisis soon and recapture some of the early fire.<br /><br />I think that Never Stop and Made Possible could have been edited into one killer album, rather than two good albums.<br /><br />Whatever, it's just my opinion (so far) as a long-standing fan. I might be missing something. Anyway - a 3-star Bad Plus record is still well worth a listen.
B00AMBM9MO|3.0|This movie had its moments but there were also points where you just wanted it to end.  Some good parts but it was overall just okay.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's very interesting. I haven't put my pad down since I downloaded it. I don't understand why I got to a certain point and it wouldn't let me go any farther.

If you prefer engaging your mind with a centuries old (I hope I'm right with that assumption) board game instead of a tilt and fire arcade game, pick this one. And trust me, go ahead and pay for the game; it's really not that expensive and it's nice to support a company that provides a solid, well produced product.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is really fun.  I love playing it and I want to play it all the. time . I love feeding it
B000USU92G|5.0|Purchased this DVD as a birthday gift for my friend and she loves it!! This DVD is hard to find and I was happy to find it online!! She watches it alot!!
B0051T46XM|5.0|Blair Witch Project is a good example of a cheaply made, yet effective, first try at filmmaking. Troll Hunter takes that attempt a few miles further an adds rather impressive 'amateur' CG effects and a healthy dose of both seriousness, research and complexity, yet at he same time isn't afraid to poke lots of fun at itself when necessary. I highly recommend Troll Hunter to anybody with an appreciation for good storytelling and great fun and action. Easily one of the very greatest films produced by young up-and-coming filmmakers!
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Great movie! Great price through Amazon to!
B009U9S6FI|4.0|Father was a WWII POW, such books by Frankl interest me.  My Father was a good man and Christian to the core based on what he experienced through war and captivity.

B00A8V3VVG|5.0|This soundtrack was exactly what I wanted. If you loved the movie and the music that was playing during, you will love this soundtrack!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Very good and easy to install kindle fire. Makes viewing easy. Instructions were easy to understand. Am very happy with this purchase
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Love this movie.  It came in good condition and works well.  Would recommend to anyone to purchase and enjoy this movie.
B004SEUJVO|5.0|I did not see this movie while it was in the theatre so I purchased the Blu-ray. It is a very good movie full of humor and romance. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes comedy and Kristen Stewart. You will not be disappointed. A++++++++++++++
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I needed this item to complete my Harry Potter movie collection. It arrived fast, in perfect condition and the price was right. All as expected.

B000VHXBIU|5.0|Funny movie could watch it hundreds of times. Always makes me laugh. Jamie lee Curtis and Kevin Kline are too funny.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Keeps your mind off every day issues.  It's fun and great for wasting time or sitting in a waiting room.
B005LAII12|4.0|Although I liked the unrated version, after you watch it once it gets old. It's still a good and funny movie, but it's like telling a joke. Once you hear it once you know the punch line and it doesn't make you laugh.
B00AQMQBKK|5.0|I am a big fan of strategy board games. I was saddened by the lack of electronic versions for the Kindle. This electronic version of Elder Signs plays like its board game predecessor. Please support this game and the electronic version of Carcassonne as well as Hey That's My Fish. Perhaps we will see more strategy board games make their way to the Kindle
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|It's a good album but I wish it had more songs from 'Come On Over'. I'm pretty sure Shania had more hits on 'Come On Over' than what they put on this Greatest Hits CD. I don't regret buying this and I enjoy the CD still.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very realistic!!!  Buying things is way too expensive though.  I'd like to be able to buy thoroughbreds and race them.  Show jumping is not my thing but I do adore horses, so I rated this game four stars.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|if you see this game get it at first I dint know what it is but then I got it and had so mitch fun get this game.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Worth a download. And they seem to be improving it with updates. Would have gotten 5 stars if you could beat and proceed to different levels.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'd recommend it to any of my friends. Something for anyone in it can't wait to finish the rest of the series
0425263908|4.0|very good book and has a good story line,  Very similiar to shades of grey.  I'm currently reading reflected..  that's good too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|It's like all Vince Flinn books, I get started I can't put it down. LOOKING forward to his next book.
B000VSYDRM|1.0|It was painful. Could not recommend it.  It offended my sense of smell, did not really get a sense of the murderer's story.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Totally addictive kinda frustrating but that is what makes me love this game and makes it a  challenge recommend to all your friends and they will become totally hooked I bet! Get right now and join the many that play it
B008ROH07W|5.0|Allison Balsom is my favorite trumpet virtuoso.  Her sound is so beautiful and pure, and she is quite creative, transcribing works for the trumpet beyond the normal trumpet repertoire.  Just totally gorgeous sound. I have several of her recordings, the Bach is also heavenly.
030758836X|3.0|Easy to read and follow. The plot was smart and unexpected, just until the last third, didnt like that twist too much, but yet it redeemed itself with the ending.  I recommend it.
0385536828|3.0|As most readers say. like all Ian McEwan, this is an entertaining, well-written read. I thoroughly enjoyed the process and was sorry when it was over for the loss of an intelligent, genuinely entertaining novel.<br /><br />BUT--and I haven't noticed any other reviewers commenting on this, I found the premise of the plot, that a national spy agency would spend so much effort and money on a fiction writer (Tom Haley) with dubious credentials for supporting their politics, unconvincing. Moreover, it was also unconvincing that Serena herself would evidence so little concern  (either positive or critical) about her own involvement with a spy agency. Even though she works at such a bureaucratic remove, her lack of comment about the horrors of Britain's battle with the IRA is odd. AND, I found Tom's final position toward her at the very end incredible, after all her mendacity.<br /><br />It's strange: McEwan's imagination for plot twists is dazzling, yet ultimately his plots are too incredible to support his great talent.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|I recently built my first gaming PC.  I made a few mistakes here and there, but this processor was hands down the best bang-for the buck component I purchased.  Before purchasing this CPU, I did read that it would require an separate fan.  The chip is installed on a [[ASIN:B0061XSBZG ASUS Sabertooth X79 LGA 2011 Intel X79 SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard]] with a [[ASIN:B005OREE38 PHANTEKS PH-TC14PE 5x?8mm Dual Heat-Pipes Dual 140mm Premium Fans and Quiet CPU Cooler with patented P.A.T.S coating]] . It maybe a bit of overkill, but I can run Battlefield 3 on ultra sttings without heat issues.<br /><br />The processor has handled every application I have thrown at with blazing fast speed. And even for a first-time builder, the installation was simple and it worked right out of the box. I am a very happy customer.
B009O07NDY|3.0|definitely not as memorable as the LOTR soundtracks.  it was good but would serve more as background music, there's not really any memorable runs or melodies aside from the main one).
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A thrilling tale of honor, love, fear, and valiant heroes. The end of each chapter forced me to continue reading.
B001AFF25W|3.0|got this on recommendation. it provided something to past time, and contained a few points to<br />interject into your life if you find yourself falling behind on things you want to accomplished.
B001H1SVO8|5.0|This is a really great movie, one of my faves. The acting is on point and the plot is amazingly unpredictable.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|Would have been better if there had not been so much time in the therapist's office, but found it entertaining.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|Well written and researched, The Shifting Fog is a walk in history with a touch of the who-dunnit. While it moves around in time as an elderly lady relives old memories it does this without causing confusion.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This is my most favorite book of all the books I have read. As soon as I finished the book, I saw the movie in 3D. Amazing how the movie was almost identical to the book. You can not say that for many book-to-movie pairs. The book was well written and was an amazing story. Truly a must read. I recommend to all except young readers due to some graphic content.
159668139X|5.0|I bought this book before I decided on what style my first loom would be.  Due to financial and time constraints, I opted to start with a backstrap contraption I would build myself.  This book has nothing on that but will be useful once I have the loom set up and am actually weaving.  It also has a way to build a simple frame for smaller projects made with combs, duct tape and boards.  I do plan to try that but I always start big first and then go small.  Backwards, I know.  Could have been weaving this weekend if I'd just waited for the book and built the loom it offers.<br /><br />Not an in depth pattern book but a good intro to weaving for beginners and a good place to start.<br /><br />After receiving several other books, including one specifically on backstrap looms, I'm finding myself using this book the most.  It's the only one out of 4 books I purchased that details how to set up continuous-string heddles.  Also finding the draft reading sections most helpful in deciphering patterns.  Updated my stars.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|This is a concert with James Taylor and Carole King singing their hits together. Nostalgic and enjoyable, this is an album any true folk/pop aficionado must have.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Even if Charlie didn't have a deeper issue, the raw portrayal of a boy trying to find his place in this world felt so real.  It brought me back to my younger days and the emotional struggles I had.
1935670913|5.0|Not only did I find this book of real value but it's still on my bookshelf for future reference so that's got to be a strong recommendation in and of itself.
B00009QG68|5.0|this is such a great movie. although it's so well known i'm not going to review it but rather this edition. the xtreme edition has lots of special features, including deleted scenes that actually show sara connor having a dream about reese (and it's actually michael beihn) and extra scenes where the t 1000 malfunctions from the end of the film and more! really cool stuff!!!
B005LAII9O|4.0|Action, drama, guns, violence, twists, drugs, Blake Lively is hot, and Salma Hayek is hot plus a good actress. Nuff said.
B00005B36H|4.0|lost a star for to much weird noises! most tracks start with nonsense noise that you have to skip through to get to the actual song. the actual songs though are fantastic! this is not entirely new for tool however it is over the top on this album. aenima at least has some of the weird  noises as separate tracks so it's easier to skip them.
B0029XFNAI|5.0|Maybe not as good as the original version, but still a Holiday must see. Nice features on bluray and looks great!
B000KJT8IG|5.0|My family has always watched this movie every year at Christmas time. It is so funny and was a perfect stocking stuffer for my husbnad!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's SO cool. Lots of new things. If I were you, I would download it. I hope there will be a #3!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is an awesome story line with even better actors!  The make-up & costumes rock!!<br />Hooked from the very first episode of Season one!!~
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I kept reading because I just knew that there was a reason for all the author was saying.... I was not disappointed, at the end, it all made sense.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The production value is so high that its like very episode is miniature movie, it's great!  I only wish there were more episodes to watch!
B007SGM084|5.0|I honestly haven't read in years. My co-worker was reading the first book and was telling how good it was so I gave it a whirl and bought all 3 books. I read them within 3 weeks because I just couldn't put them down. I would love to read more about them if ever possible. I have also referred the books to others I know love to read.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My grandkids came to visit and loved that I had loaded this on my kindle for them.<br /><br />But don't tell them that I don't have the coordination to play the game.
B003AYZBM0|3.0|The book is about a dysfunctional group of people who have chosen to hide away on an island off the cast of Thailand. Unfortunately for them the island is also occupied by a group of people growing marijuana illegally.<br />The book explores some of the relationships between the people in the settlement, and ends up in a bloody confrontation within the settlers and with the drug peddalrs.<br />Less than enjoyable<br /> The book was made into a film starring Leonardo di Caprio
B000I9YLUI|5.0|This version of Pride & Prejudice is by far my favorite! The music. The chemistry between the characters. The scenery. It's magical! :)
0634022296|5.0|I've owned a bunch of Beatle chord books through the years. Most don't account for the capos and tunings the Beatles actually used, but this book does. It also includes a ton of the more obscure Beatle songs that most chord books leave out like Blue Jay Way and Long, Long, Long. Only complaint is that it doesn't include any covers the Beatles made, a small drawback in an otherwise excellent product.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun Fun Fun Game. I would recommend to any fan. great sound effect, graphics and challenge. well worth the money spent.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It is cool awesome and coool cool cool cool sweet cool cool cool cool cool cool cool sweet fun fun
B003E6K1VK|5.0|I use this solo with my laptop and it's OK. Add the docking station E9 amp and this baby will drive any audiophile headset made today.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|decent movie.  not as good as original ones.  worth renting.  glad i didn't see it in the theater.  hopefully next one will be better.
B000PMG16U|5.0|Ewan McGregor and Natalie Portman star in George Lucas' sci-fi prequel trilogy.<br />These films focus on Anakin Skywalker and his mentor, Ben \\"Obi-Wan\\" Kenobi's<br />adventures. I'm a fan of all these films in the Star Wars franchise and glad to<br />have them on blu-ray. These films have nice picture and sound and recommend<br />them to sci-fi fans.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Lobe the game but the updates on apple products get the update before amazon/ android. Please make the updates be released on the same day or a few days after
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Now that season 3 is underway, it's great to see the first two seasons. I'm also a sucker for the exta behind the scenes stuff and this set does not dissappoint!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I unlock a lot ppl it awesome must buy it<br />It's fun and addicting must have for everyone even pets
0740785508|5.0|This book really goes over a lot, not digging in too deep to any one subject, but goes into enough detail to really help boost up your 2d skills on many fronts.
B0083WLKBA|5.0|A friend has been watching the series on PBS and it sounded too snooty for my tastes. However, I was curious enough to order the first two seasons--and now I have ordered the third season. So much for preconceived ideas.
0740797719|5.0|This book goes into depth on many aspects of lighting, shading, and general rendering in 2d. I have many coworkers who heartily recommend this for texture artists and even lighting artists, not to mention 2d artists.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone from aspiring artist to professionals in any form of art. From digital 3d to traditional 2d.
1118232658|5.0|Socialnomics is eye opening and attention grabbing. It presents several case studies of how people used various social media platforms to have their message heard, promote a product, brand and grow their businesses. If you're interested in learning more about how to garner the power the great social media marketing tools, this book is a must read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is very very fun and I say every one should have it. I love upgrade games.I love it.and I suggest that kids play it too.
B000J159N8|1.0|The movie would not play in any of four blu rays or DVDs.  It was garbage and getting a refund was even worse.  I will never buy a DVD or blu ray through Amazon again.
B004J64QSI|4.0|Other than the Jonas brother attempting to stretch his talent this edition is well worth having in your collection. Gave several as gifts with approving reception.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|He gives sensational stories with vague details, seems like he is trying to build his reputation for the purposes of promoting his business.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Grandson loves it plays it every time he is here.  Can't get him to stop I have it on my phone.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It made me cry and it made me smile. It was over all one of the best books.
B001GXY92U|5.0|J.S. Bach: Keyboard Concertos BWV 1052, 1055, 1056, 1058 is a 2008 EMI recording starring pianist/conductor David Fray as he leads the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie Bremen. Mark Audus has written the music notes. A delightful recording that I very much enjoyed. Highly recommended. 5/5.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I have five grandchildren who use my Kindle.  My six year old granddaughter always goes for this game first.  She loves it!
B00B49L7JY|5.0|A story of a regular man, an amazing poet with a lovely voice, inspiring millions unknowingly from across the globe.
B000NVIXDW|5.0|These old standards are great and his new music is worth remembering.  Love Michael Buble's easy style and his interpretation of the standards.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I have read many of these books & all have been excelent. The authors I have never read before but are now on my reading list.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was a very good book, it kept you guseeing what was going to happen next. The book was hard to put down .
B0091REZMW|5.0|Downloaded this game just to pass the time. On the other hand found that it isn't that bad of a game and find myself playing often.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This app is awesome it has new things you need to get past the monster is bigger. There is a gold mine and lots more new things this app is great you should get it and it's free too
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it. It's. very fun and kills time. It does need to be rebooted and reinstalled because it's such a large app.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|need to uninstall...it' s stuck and I want it gone from my Kindle fire! I don't even know how this initially showed up.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|The Super Star Destroyer is simply amazing. I put it together with my roommate and it took is 8-9 hours to get the piece together. I'm so proud to be able to display this. The base is also well thought out, doesn't seem in danger of falling over in the slightest. This thing is also very long. Even knowing the dimensions, the size took me off guard.
B00AYB20KI|3.0|Overall I think the movie is your average horror film, par for the course these days. Interesting twist at the end. Worth renting, I personally wouldn't buy it.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|so far i am loving this game and i am sure my girls will love it too. It's easy to use and fun at the same time. The animals are very cute as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the obstacles are more of a challenge!  just exciting I have been waiting so much better than the original :)
B0058U0EEO|5.0|Yea, Washed Out is always great. So I wasn't surprised when I really enjoyed this album. So get it, and drive around.
B008TMA1LY|5.0|Entertaining. Got it for my three year old and can't stop playing myself. Not complicated. Nice art. Good for hello kitty fans.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|This movie was a perfect gift for a friend that is fixing up a house. The movie arrived on time and was not damages at all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book And definitely recommend it! I couldn't put it down.. Sweet love story. Wonderful author.. Love love
B00B2V66VS|4.0|it is addictive and better than Temple Run; the objectives are different and better. I cannot stop playing I will sit and play for hours
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome! it is really fun you can change your chareter and your bord and you can even can get new stuff.and if I was you I whould get this game
B00APUQH0W|5.0|This movie kept us entertained from beginning to end.  A little predictable but a great story &#34;Eastwood&#34; style.  You'll love it if you like Clint.
030746363X|4.0|There are some sections that I loved and some that I felt was just filler. This is a guide not the end all be all.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|This app seems to write fine compared to the last office app I tried which was free. He  it has crashed for me but that's the be expected with some respect because I'm using a tablet and not a full computer. I'm in love with the option to put in landscape profit or sensor mode. I fine it supper annoying to have to correct the screen every time there is a slightest bump.<br />Will update.
B008J344BQ|5.0|She is amazing, love her music, she puts her all into her music.  Would recommend this CD to all. It is a great CD
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Lots of ups and downs this season and things happen that are unbelievable and sad. I love this show and hope there are many seasons to come!
B004UXUUDA|5.0|BOUGHT THIS AS SOMEONE LIKED IT SO MUCH THEY WALKED AWAY WITH MINE.GREAT STORY AND ACTING WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great game full of mystery and intrigue.  I just had to unlock the full version!  I can't wait to play more.
B0077ATSSQ|5.0|SAD BUT REALISTIC. TOM HANKS ACTING AS ALWAYS CARRIES THE MOVIE. GREAT MOVIE AND I RECOMMEND THIS FOR YOURSELF OR AS A GIFT
B007SGM084|5.0|I contemplated reading this series based on negative and positive reviews and decided to purchase this for myself.  I loved all three books and could never put it down once I started.  Not a series for somebody who is easily offended by sexual details and certainly not recommended for younger readers in my opinion.
1401307450|5.0|The Red hot Chili peppers have been my favorite band for years. This book is a great read for any fan.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|There is no back-up capability for your favorite stations. If you buy a new phone or reset your device all your favorite stations are gone and you will have to start over. There is no import or export capability for the stations that you saved.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Anything this cast, crew and creators puts out is outstanding. I doubt I will ever be disappointed. Season 4 seems so far away!
B006LSZECO|2.0|The story was very riveting.  I couldn't put it down.  It kept me coming back to finish it.  Then........I got to the ending.....felt like the author got tired of writing!  The book was engrossing and took unexpected twists and turns (as well as some sloppy story lines) but I have never read such a good storyline with such a quick and awful ending.  I felt as though I wasted A LOT of time getting to that point...and actually turned the pages to see if there was more......sorry to say I just felt like it was a waste of time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app seems to be so much more accurate than the weather channel app. Woke up to rain one morning recently but found weather channel app stating the sun was going to shine all day long. Made the switch after that
B004NOH9LC|5.0|The movie had a slow start, and it was tough to hold out.  But, once the Ford persona was landed / extorted into the new job the tempo picked up.  The movie proved light, at times humorous, surprisingly entertaining, particularly the scenes where Harrison Ford demonstrated his hard core reporting and light-hearted culinary skills.  Surprisingly, it was a movie which my spouse enjoyed watching, and that's a rarity.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is one of the many Christmas movies that were great. I got it for my father for Christmas and every season we watch it mostly everyday.
0817439390|4.0|This is a very good book if you're just getting into photography, and even more so if you just got a DSLR. It will teach you how the three basics elements(aperture, shutter, ISO) interact with each-other and how they affect your exposure. It has examples with pictures and it guides you through taking the same type of shots with your own camera. I read this book a few years ago and have since gotten it a gift twice for friends who got into photography.
B00005KHEU|5.0|A classic rock group i like a lot. If you like classic rock with a touch of boogie, then I recommend these guys.
B000002W8O|5.0|Have had the cassette and was ready to move up to the CD. This is one of Elvis's best Christmas Albums or any time.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B00006JSS8|5.0|Stevie Wonder is one of many of my classics that i have both on vinyl and CD. I add him to my many compilation CD's i make for travels in the car and on my ipod.
1616614609|2.0|I got this game for my brother for Christmas.<br /><br />After playing it for a bit, though, it became very obvious that it has some pretty big problems out of the box.<br /><br />The biggest problem is that a lot of the decks are really terribly misbuilt, making the game very frustrating from the hacker's point of view. While the game itself seems sound enough in theory, the actual decks they provide you with for one of the two roles are nearly useless, which means you can't really play it very fairly with just this set.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.. I laughed I cried an god was I pissed at both abby and Travis at one point of time or another... but that's what a really good love story goes...
0783219598|5.0|I really love this movie. I got it for my grandkids for Christmas, as somehow they had never seen it!
B000JQUZCI|3.0|I know this is a classic but I just could not get into the story. Thought I would try electronic books but I need the paper feel when reading.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Smooth and easy to navigate. Very addicting. Gems can be difficult to obtain, but not impossible. I would definitely recommend this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Oh my hell, episode six almost had me throwing my kindle across the room!! Great series, I am hooked! Going to be tough waiting for season 4.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Love it. Trying to get new combinations is an art. I can always use more friends! I gift gold all the time storm8id : grelck
B00A8ECU24|1.0|this app did not work on my kindle so unless they decide to fix this problem i will be giving this app a bad review
B001E9641K|5.0|Great alternative to Ticket to Ride  when you only have 2 players. Also good if you are into learning Scandinavian geography.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I bought the CD because Part 1 is one of my favorite CDs ever. And I listen to eeeeverything. Part 1 is more about love; ranging from upbeat to morose. This cd is definitely more mellow and epic. I love still love it though.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This item is very well built, and easy to use.  Its fitment for my Nikon Camera is perfect.  I highly recommend this item.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Quirky, crazy book.  Always looking for a unique storyline from a true story-teller.  Gillian Flynn definitely has her own voice.
B0015DWLD0|5.0|Hard to believe that this really goes on, but welcome to the new world!!  A fun read, I would recommend it.
B00A0L7PE8|4.0|Once again, Prince has done something that has to grow on me. Those are usually the best ones. I will say that the party versions are more appealing than the radio versions.
B007AJFSJW|1.0|I HAD to read this for Book Club and I'm a Conservative!!  That says it all!  Would not read Krugman by choice!!
0738727326|5.0|I am giving it 5 stars just because the art is most amazing thing that I have ever seen! The feel of deck is beautiful and I feel like I can actually feel their essence. I've started reading and they are very accurate. I am just in love with them.<br /><br />The only bad thing is that they are very slide-y. I put them down and some just slide off. Another thing is that they are a bit small and are easily bendable. Meaning that they do get damage rather quickly if you don't take care of them.<br /><br />Even so I think they deserve a five star because of the uniqueness of the art and the great vibe I get from the deck. To each their own but this is definitely my main deck now.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|What a great way to stay in touch with family and friends no matter how far away we go from each other.
1451696191|5.0|I bought this book for my wife and although she is not much a reader, due to limitations in her time, she was hooked and knocked it off in record time.
B0011UJMK2|3.0|The first third/half was great in describing communist Russia and the characters. After that the book started to take privileges and it just lost what it has spent so much time building up. I think the story could have been great but the ending was too \\"nice\\".
B0099116AY|5.0|GREAT MOVIE - Men should watch this Movie and learn more what it is like to be a woman and what she puts up with.
B0061Q13V2|5.0|It was a really raw but real read that Dominique explains about her life. I recommend everyone to read it!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like the game and the ways you make money with the horse but also spend money to take care of him. Saving and budgeting to buy new things is realistically slow going and takes real patience. Overall, a nice waste of time app that makes you keep coming back.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This games is very cute and fun. I loved playing it. Only you have to have no WiFi for it not to freeze up.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love historical fiction and Follett is a master!  Gives an insight into the characters and their actions that led to WWI.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is always a great way to spend time with, especially on a airline and this<br />one is a good one.  You can challenge yourself with different settings and the<br />layout is nice.
B008AG3PK8|3.0|In the finale of Season 5, Don is compelling in every scene, well, except when he has a toothache. (Didn't Freud say that when a man has a toothache, he cannot love?) It's hard to get enough of him, even when the writing goes lame. Roger is great. Sally is great. Megan and her parents are interesting. I hope they're not on their way out. On the other hand, it's easy to get enough of Pete--what a bore his office sex, brothel sex, and hotel sex are! What a bore his dark speech about the emptiness of life is! The actor is quite unattractive, and it's a shame he gets the high billing he does. I've tried to like Peggy but can't really. The most appealing thing about her is her boyfriend. I keep hoping her hair is about to turn into something short of offensive. Why in the same setting of the sixties can Joan's be lovely and fall around her face beautifully while Peggy's is stiff and overdone and makes the actress even harder to look at than she is?<br /><br />In summary: More Don, more Roger, more Joan, more Megan, more Betty (outside Weight Watchers meetings, for God's sake!), more Ken and Harry and Stan. Much less Pete and Peggy (let her be scarce with her new job). Please!
B003Q6D27S|3.0|Price was great but movie was perdictable. If freinds asked me if they should buy it I would tell them to wait for it to be in Walmart's $5 bin. I baught it to complete my Saw movie collection.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Wasn't sure what to expect from his CD since Iam new to his music, but other than one or two songs I liked it.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|This book is amazing just like the showbiz recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read finished it in one night
6305781427|5.0|I fell in love with his very first CD. His music is the best as far as I'am concerned. He turned me on to other music of his kind, sometime soft and relaxing, other times upbeat but still nice on the ears. My dad & uncle liked to watch his concerts as did I..I got to see him twice in concert and it was the best. It seemed like he played forever which was ok for me.
0470449764|5.0|It's a new book I think, and only 9 dollars. Very good and cheap for me! I like it very much!
0765325950|5.0|All I have to say, without wanting to reveal anything for people who haven't read this or other books, is that the Wheel of Time series both under Jordan and under Sanderson has been the most influential series in my life. I grew up with the books and they have supported me through middle school, high school, college, and now adult life.<br /><br />The ending was magnificent and all I can say is that I await the encyclopedia that should come out sometime next year with great anticipation.<br /><br />If you have read the other books then I don't need to tell you to buy this.<br />If you have not read the series, but you enjoy fantasy and great story telling then you have an obligation to yourself to buy and read them all.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|There is a tendency for sequels and follow ups to lose punch as time goes on. Stories get worn out and stale, but that is not the case here. The writers take tips from history and real life to keep things interesting. They do a great job of showing life from such widely different points of view that are somehow connected. If you get tired of the splendor of Downton, you are wisked away to Scotland and that completely different culture and landscape. You really get a sense of time flying by (modernity) and also standing still (tradition). It is such an interesting contrast. If you liked the first two, you will probably like this one. It has enough of the original elements and cast to feel connected, but enough variety and change to let you know that this is its own story.<br /><br />The only negative I see with this is the stereotyping of Americans. Shirley MacLaine's role as the loud, vulgar American is over the top. Her maid as the forward, sex hungry, inappropriate, \\"progressive\\" American is also irritating. The rest of the cast is much more multi-faceted than that. Why not give the Americans their due as well?<br /><br />Anyway, I can't wait for the next one.
B0086700CM|1.0|I thought this would be something different. Tilting and turning my Kindle  to accomplixh anything at all was a great turn off for starters. This should be  advertised as &#34;video-game&#34;, because that's what it is. I HATE those!
0747553556|5.0|I'm a little late to read Kitchen Confidential. I became a fan of Anthony Bourdain from No Reservations. Reading this now after getting to know him through other projects was fun.  Kinda like watching the second and third star wars(the originals) then seeing the first. Some of the surprises are spoiled but it's fun to yell at the screen \\"dude you kissed your sister and that's totally your dad\\" ,\\"dude get off the smack already and get your snarky mug beamed into my living room\\". For me it was a great prequel to what I know about the man. Obviously the book came before all the tv fame but for a lot of people, a little late to jump on the bourdain wagon, this will be an awesome prequel. A lot better than the three new star wars movies.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I will not get it because I'm fed up with Westeros, the imaginary land where it takes place, as well as the characters and the whole thing. Number four (got the paper back version) was really frustrating and boring. I did enjoy  the first two books. Reading number 3 was quite disappointing but I managed to finish it. Reason? Martin's a great writer, no doubt but as of book 3, the original Story-line and characters start to fade out or just vanish. The remaining ones, after some FOUR THOUSAND PAGES are still pretty much the same age (Not even Homer's Illiad does that!),- (boring)... It 'is' a \\"saga\\", only because it all takes place in Westeros . So Westeros IS the main character! (and whores, and BLOODY CRUEL MURDERS, and \\"bastard-borns\\"... and MORE cruelty and treason...ENOUGH...MORE THAN ENOUGH!!) Too much of the same for me.
B000002JSR|4.0|\\"Coda\\" followed fast on the heels of the death of John Bonham.  Being an album of older cuts and a few leftovers from the \\"In Through the Out Door\\" sessions, it doesn't have the cohesive feel of the \\"proper\\" albums, nor should it be expected to.  Some really dislike it, and that's too bad, because the band chose some of the hardest rocking stuff they had for this underrated CD.  Now \\"Coda\\" has been remastered, and is very inexpensive, too.  Led Zeppelin completists who overlook this or general fans are making a mistake.<br />  The album opens with some of the hardest rock they ever did, covering Ben E. King's \\"We're Gonna Groove\\".  Plant sounds tougher than hell, and Page's guitar work is pure power and ripping lead guitar.  How this gem escaped being on an earlier album is a mystery to me.  \\"Poor Tom\\" sounds like it could have fit into the second side of \\"Led Zeppelin III\\", and the tunes \\"Walter's Walk\\" and the closer \\"Wearing and Tearing\\" are bruisers, with fast tempos and some of Page's rawest energy aplenty.  If \\"Coda\\" has a weak point, it might be \\"Ozone Baby\\", a fair to middlin' song that is okay, but not especially great.  The obligatory drum solo, \\"Bonzo's Montreaux\\" is included as tribute, and here we get a sample of the power this man possessed.<br />  For those wanting a taste of the raw side of Zeppelin, it's well worth the money.  It's still Led Zeppelin, and nobody did Zeppelin music better than them.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a very nicely crafted hidden object game.  I devour these kinds of games on my handheld game console, so it was nice to find such a good one for my kindle.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read non stop from beginning to end. I was instantly emotionally invested in the characters and will be looking forward to the next book.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|John Mayer at his best!!! If you haven't seen this show and you are a fan of John you HAVE to see this DVD!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game a year ago and since then I have been getting every update and could not put it down. If I am playing and somebody calls me I have to get nudged to stop. A truely epic game that is very addicting.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|EWAN MCGREGOR ALWAYS ENTERTAINING .,  i PURCHASE ALL MOVIES HE IS PERFORMING IN,.  HE DESERVES MORE AWARDS.  DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHY IS IS PASSED OVER,  HE HAS A BEAUTIFUL &#34;PERFECT PITCH&#34; VOICE AS WELL.<br />AND ALWAYS ENTERTAINING.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a really fun game that is almost like temple run but better, and super easy but sometimes challenging. I love it
B005LAJ1O0|3.0|This worked out well for something that my husband and I could watch together but be prepared for creepy and twisted!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I bypassed this game many times, then I finally  decided to give it a try I am glad that I did this game is fun. A great game for hand eye cordination
B008YRTWM8|5.0|Movie was great very sad and funny inspirational....HIGHLY RECCOMEND<br />Didn't cost to much bought watched it a 3 times and didn't get old
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very enjoyable. gives a busy mom a fun game to play when I only have a few minutes at a time. great graphics as well!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Its such a handy app. I love using it so much more than the default google browser. Its a great app.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|subway surfers is the worst game ever it erased my game over three times! It also locked up multiple times!<br />it was good at first though.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is pretty cool. I just got the update from new York to Rio and its not much different but no matter it is great to pass time and challenge ur friends to earn each other more coins
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a amazing game and it was very good and addictive plus it is free that makes it better
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Definitely a page turner, couldn't put it down.  Although I wish there were more books in the series, can't wait to read the next book!
B0012CH350|5.0|perfect fit. Covers my weber perfectly nice and snug. Great buy and quality material. Highly recommended. light weight! . .
B00821OW8K|5.0|How I missed this series for two years is beyond me, and I really have to thank Amazon Prime because I would have never known about it without them.  Earth has been invaded by aliens and they are attempting to destroy our race and enslave our children.  Hands down the best Sci-Fi series I've seen since Lost.  The characters are amazing enough that even those that don't like the action in a series, will fall in love with it because of the underlying human drama element. I watched the entire two years in less than two weeks if that tells you how blown away I was by this series.
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|Would watch it over and over again. I absolutely loved it. It reminded me  of my school life.very much so
B00APUQH0W|5.0|What another smash hit from Clint! My wife and I really enjoyed it. I would recommend it for movie night.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|i love all they do, each band member is a king. The vocalist is a premier bass player, and the best drummer alive.son of the best one dead!
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Terrific premise.  Especially with the Manti Te'o brouhaha.  Would have been interesting to know what it was in the &#34;relationship&#34; that prompted the guys to make the film in the first place.  Loved the &#34;characters&#34; and watching the events unfold.  But, makes me wonder if the backstory was filmed after the ending.
B001MSMULG|5.0|The stories are so plausible.  The hero kills out of necessity and never is it glamorous or gratuitous.  But it is also so interesting to read his thoughts on Saudi Arabia, the Vatican, and the politics of the mid-east as seen by a Jewish/non-American.
B00005ABTT|4.0|Enjoyed watching this movie again and the quality was great as expected, The shipment took a while but I was sent from England so it was pretty fast considering!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Heaven is a romance story with a very good trama. I couldn't put it down. I have read other books of Nicholas Sparks and this one is very good includes romance and suspense. I looking forward to see the movie...
B00006AG5N|5.0|I love Elvis music, so I love this!  It's so nice to set back and have a quiet listen, to my favorite teenage idol.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Learning that genetically altered wheat is addictive exactly like drugs made me decide to try going wheatless.<br />After three days I was amazed to experience no craving for wheat and sugar filled snacks.  The Dr. Thoroughly explains and documents his findings making it a compelling presentation that changed the way I see food.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game on my cell and kindle fire. its addicting and fun to play.  great for any age!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|There are far to few artists performing the older style music.  Michael performs in a fashion that makes you sit up and take notice.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|One of the most honest and hopeful books I've ever read. I laughed and I cried and it is one of those books you are sad to close. I will miss Pat and Tiffany and all the characters. That is how I know I love a book. I close it and feel like I will miss my friends.
B0049IWQJW|5.0|My kid was mesmerized, as were my wife and I.  The amount of detail and emotions they get into the characters is great.
B00APUYN0I|3.0|I love a capella music, and the song scenes were great - but there was too much adolescent-boy humor involving vomit, and not enough Rebel Wilson.
B0037VNX44|2.0|I did not enjoy the video because of the poor, and to my preception, strange presentation. Perhaps that was intended to get across the character of the man and the situations.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in years.  Very enjoyable.  Have told a lot of my friends about the book and they all related that they enjoyed it.  It's a book that you can't put down and the story will take you where you don't expect to go.  I really liked this book.  Buy it.
B0047VSW30|4.0|Even though he story may not be historically complete in all aspects, it is valid enought that it is a crediable motivation to ask questions about the role of religions in western civilization. One will be challanged to evaluate what is political power, what is manipulation of the masses, and what is true faith in philosophy and religion.
B004DM1ZQY|3.0|The game shows you the possible moves for each active piece, so the thinking part of backgammon is largely reduced to choosing the best outcome. Not an advantage, in my way of thinking, but perhaps good for beginners.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Readers of contemporary romance / new adult will love this one from Colleen Hoover. It's well-written and engaging, making it a joy to read.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Delightful. A well told tale of two lovers who thought they couldn't - wouldn't let themselves - fall in love, but unwittingly did anyway.<br /><br />Well written.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I purchased this as an extra to have in my travel kit.  Great little cord and I am glad there is enough cord to plug in and stretch to a bedside table.  When traveling the wall sockets are not always close by where you need to plug in your unit for charging so I was very pleased with the length of this cord.
B005NF2UE6|5.0|..you'll love this CD. I bought this CD for my son as he loves this group. I myself listened to some of their songs and actually enjoyed them, so it's not my taste in general. I'm a senior who kind of stopped with &#34;Pink Floyd&#34; and &#34;Metallica&#34; but ever so often, something new comes along I can still &#34;get into&#34;. I guess this group is one of them.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|I loved it. I think it is a great movie for kids and adults. I enjoyed watching it at home.
B004VQRCF0|3.0|i was looking forward to dvd thinking how good the cd was. it should have been great but the sound was awful,a lot of soloeing instead of sticking to song. it was nice to see bruford & rabin again but kaye is not in the same league as wakeman. skip the dvd & enjoy the cd. what happened to lift me up??? not on dvd?
0062200909|5.0|lo mejor para cualquier coleccionista en espera de la segunda vercion lo mejor para cualquier coleccionista,  lo recomiendo para toda ocasion 100% recomendado tanto para toda la familia de seguro le va a gustar
6303477259|5.0|even without roger waters pink floyd never sounded better. the show covers everything from the early years to the division bell which in my opinion was an awesome cd & their last one as floyd. the lights,lasers,special effects like the plane flying over & crashing to the pigs coming out of the boxes,this was the best show i've ever seen.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very detailed and well written! I couldn't put it down!  Very nice twist and ending. I look forward to reading more by Ms. Flynn!
B009E3EXMU|5.0|great footage & sound is very good. i really enjoyed jason bonham on drums,he's an awesome player..zeppelin fans will miss his father but he does a wonderful job.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is pretty interesting and passes the time very easily. Fun if your real into the hoarse thing. I guess I would recommend this game to someone who is looking for something they can take care of.
630463949X|5.0|the dvd was awesome. great audio & video. they seemed to really be having fun & it showed. last show i think w/christine in the band. lots of rumour songs which was their best.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|so addicting. I think that it may have changed my life a little bit. kind of. Not really. But it kept my roommate entertained for hours.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|If you are looking for a book to keep you captivated then this series is for you!  I feel like this could be a true story!!
B0041KKYBA|5.0|There are a lot of people who should be held accountable, but no, they're running the economic system now - heaven help us all!!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|If you are looking for a book to keep you captivated then this series is for you!  I feel like this could be a true story!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love animal horse as will I love it my sister plays it a lot and learns how take care of animals
B009UNGYHG|5.0|the plantronics voyager legend charge case is a must have if you own the plantronics voyager legend headset.  the case is about the same size as my iPhone and it fits perfectly into my purse.  It is a great way to carry my headset with me at all times.  The case keeps my headset safe and charged so it is ready to use whenever I need it.  The case holds a charge for what seems to be a really long time.  I have not tested it to see how long it will hold a charge or keep my headset charged but I have yet to have it run out before I needed to recharge it.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Grisham writes about real people in the real world. I like it when the good guy has decent values,  wants to do the right--moral--thing and fights for the underdog. This book fits all that criteria.
B000O76T86|4.0|THIS IS REALLY AWESOME SCIENCE FICTION FILM I EVER SEEN. I LIKE THE PART WHEN ALIENS TRY TO DESTROY THE EARTH AND THE AIR FORCES BATTLE THEM FOR FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE DAY.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|love it! more difficult than streaker. always keeps me on my toes :) I love how they have objectives and levels for you to beat keeps the game more interesting, and oh so addictive!
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Would highly recommend! Additionally one can mix a cocktail just like Roger. Full of twists and turns to keep you wanting to watch the next episode.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|We LOVE this movie!! It is totally hilarious for both kids and adults in my opinion. It will be a classic.
B0053B347M|4.0|For starters, use a different adhesive on this. The one currently on there is from 3m, however, it constantly fell off. I used a few [[ASIN:B000OF6X48 Command Picture Hanging Strips, 4-Small, 8-Medium]] instead and it never came off again. Since it's LED then it's going to last for some time. Not sure what happened with other reviewers but mine is casting a pure white light behind my tv. It has a on/off switch on it, however, I just leave it on all the time. Once I turn on the tv it switches on and I don't need to worry about getting up and flipping the switch. I watch a lot of movies, sometimes the entire day I may have a movie marathon. After several movie marathons and a few weeks of use I'm glad I invested in it. It's only $8 and well worth it in my opinion. I have had any issues with eye strain after a long day of move marathons (IE: [[ASIN:B007ZQAKHU The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (The Fellowship of the Ring / The Two Towers / The Return of the King Extended Editions)  [Blu-ray]]] ) The colors really do seem more vibrant looking now with this. The tv I currently have it mounted on is a [[ASIN:B0071O4ETQ Samsung UN32EH5000 32-Inch 1080p 60Hz LED HDTV (Black)]](table mounted) and with [[ASIN:B003L1ZYYM AmazonBasics High-Speed HDMI Cable (6.5 Feet/2.0 Meters) - Supports Ethernet, 3D, and Audio Return [Newest Standard]]]connecting to my [[ASIN:B0076R7F1M Samsung BD-E5900 3D WiFi Blu-ray Disc Player (Black)]] so the picture is already superb. This gives it that much more of an edge with picture quality. Give it a shot, you wont regret it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Got this on black friday for 3.99 and couldnt pass up the deal. Hadnt ever seen it but the price was enough. my boys are obsessed! My 1yr will sit through the entire movie EVERY TIME getting up to dance with the songs and my 3yr sings along. It is really a cute show. I havent read that Dr.Seuss book or seen the previous movie so I cant compare to those but it is totally great.
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love every single thing these guys come up with in all their albums, and babel is just a continuation of their greatness! Each song is unique in it's own, brutally honest in their lyrics, and mood inspiring with their music set up. Love these guys, need to see them live if they ever come to Texas. Will buy anything these guys come out with.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My seven year old likes it.  She likes the competitions best.  Keeping the horse happy takes some time.  Would recommend.
1451650728|2.0|There is very little with the original characters in this book. I have had the book for two months and still have 100 pages to go. The whole book is about Data's creator and his life. Really really boring to me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is both original and very well crafted.  I was originally a bit leery as the storyline seemed a bit simplistic (earth surface is unlivable and the only survivors are in (a) &#34;silo&#34; mostly burrowed under the ground), but not to worry this is full of original stuff.  There are twist and turns at every step, and while the split between good and bad guys is clear pretty early on, the development of the story is full of surprises.  The structure makes it clear that this is a compilation of short stories, but this does not detract from the coherence of the story line, and the transitions from one part to the next are pretty seamless.<br />This is likely to become a classic.
034580404X|5.0|it was bought as a gift. it must have been a good choice. the trilogy is now beeing passed around from sister to sister. aunt to aunt friend to friend.
B007FG9LIE|3.0|This is an interesting mixture between the \\"action-movie\\" style of science fiction and the surrealistic twin-peak science-fiction genre, where you never know what is real and what is a dream.  There are three intertwined dialogs/story lines (Ethan Burke's struggle to survive in Wayward Pines and figure out how/why he got there, his flashbacks to his war experience, capture, and torture, and his family trying to figure out what happened to him).  They eventually come together, but don't necessarily fit very well.<br />So it is a bit of a choppy and uneven read, and the end is somewhat over-done and not the most credible (I was asked to remove the specifics to avoid spoiling things, but lets say that it's a clunky mix of \\"science destroys and saves the world\\").  Similarly, the moral undertone of the ending is not the most subtle (everyone has a price).<br />Overall, I don't regret reading it, but was left a bit disappointed, and had no problem putting the book aside for a couple of days before restarting.
B006X5L6VS|1.0|Unfortunately, I didn't find this app to be at all enjoyable.  Still can't figure out how it works.  I was expecting to be able to identify the many constellations in the night sky over head.  Did not work as I had hoped.  In fact, I don't like it at all.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is Appolo 13 on steroid.  The rendering of NASA's operation (at a high level) and the constraints of travelling to Mars and surviving on its surface are pretty realistic (for those who read the red/blue/green Mars trilogy, this is way more realistic), and the character of Mark Watney is endearing.  His ordeal (left behind as dead on Mars) is both credible and very well developed,  The structure that through part of the book alternates between discussions on earth at NASA and Watney's account of his daily live works well, and does not create any dead time in the pace of the story.  I read through the whole book pretty quickly and was sad to see it end (I thought the return trip and arrival back to earth could have warranted some additional material, but then I probably just did not want to see the book end).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is just like the well-known \\"Temple Run,\\" but in my opinion, it is better. Subway Surfers does not require you to tilt your device. This makes it easier to play on the go, lying down, or in a car. Subway Surfers is set in famous cities all over the world, and they switch about every 2-4 weeks. I love how this game is free. I have had this product for 2 months, and I am still entertained by it because the makers always give you goals to work for. Lastly, you can save up the coins you earn on your runs to buy characters, boards, and other gaming tools to help you rack up a high score.  The only bad thing I have to say about it is that it can lag at times. I have a kindle fire, so other kindle fire users, beware. Despite the occasional lag, this game is my favorite!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Great special effects. I only wish the Downey didn't step out with a drug problem for a few years because we lost a lot of good work from him. He is going to be the next Jack Nicholson. Watch the two Sherlock Homes movies for more of his outstanding work.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is amazing I love the characters especially Frank and i like the themes that you can surf on I like that the police man is fat lol it's just awesome game
B0053O89IS|3.0|Starting to fall in to the same thing that sinks a lot of series. Up to this season I would give them 5 stars but now were in to baby world. Much to much time devoted to the kids and personal problems and not the crime solving. Hope they work it out because I loved it up until now. House did the same thing at the end of series.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Lots of fun for all ages.  It is easy enough for my young grandkids, yet my elderly parents love it too.
B004SEUJUU|5.0|I liked it better then the first ones and usually a series like this goes down hill the longer it runs. Try the Avengers for a film with great special effects. Love to bring back the people that produced the old Flash Gordon series and let them see how far special effects have come. Woops showing my age now.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|Product fell apart in less than 3 days of use.  Returned for refund.  Nice item though, thinking I received a defective one.  May try to re-order.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works well, large numbers and it is free!!!  Love the ease of having it when I need it. Thank you
0316044695|2.0|If you like Fox News you will love this.  All guys love a good shoot-em-up, even bleeding heart liberals like me. The insights into Seal training, discipline and bravery are riveting.  However this guy, if he indeed actually wrote this instead of his ghostwriter, falls into the classic right-wing rut where it seems impossible to take responsibility for one's own actions and when anything goes wack it is the fault of \\"liberals\\". 'We can't kill non-combatants because it wouldn't be the Christian thing to do. Oh, wait, the non-combatants we didn't kill ratted us out to the bad guys and they killed my buddies, but that's because the liberals wouldn't allow us to kill the non-combatants.' I hate to say this, but since he was the lone survivor and clearly not willing to be truly thoughtful or be saddled with the ability to think independently, I found myself wondering just how much of this is fabricated or what may have been left out. I am sure there are better military ops books out there.
B0091LS07E|5.0|I LOVE this CD.. the more I hear it the more I am inspired-- recommended definitely.. espeically brand new you
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11/22/63 has all the weirdness I've come to expect Mr. King to deliver with a poignancy that startled me. The \\"what if\\" question that begins this story is one I am sure has occupied many readers and anyone who ever watched LOST-the TV series.<br /><br />If you could go back and change time would you? If you did what would happen?<br />Is the changing of time worth your life? A life? How many ripples will you create?<br /><br />Many readers and writers alike are fascinated with Time Travel as a subject. Since H.G. Wells gave us The Time Machine, readers have been treated to different variations on this theme.<br /><br />I enjoy King, but this one knocked my socks off, because of some of the things that happen along the way and how attached I grew to the characters. There is a very powerful love story woven into the fabric of time that reminded me of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander in its tenderness mixed with brutal realities. As usual once I began reading, laundry was forgotten in the dryer. (it should have been folded). Dinner was burned, (I should have remembered it was cooking), and while having many channels to choose from, TV held no interest for me. I just wanted to get back to the book.<br /><br />Neither Mr. King, nor Amazon needs my review for this book to succeed, but I'm writing it because I think King has a wickedly fantastic imagination and remains one of the best storytellers of our time.<br /><br />I am giving the book 5 stars because I loved it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I haven't watched a TV show in 20 years. This show is really well done! I highly recommend watching this masterpiece.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Fast paced, and well written story, grabs your attention from the first page to the last page. Well worth your time.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Pretty good book.  There were a few spots in the book I skipped, just because it seemed to drag in spots.
B0064MGU98|5.0|If you like great acting, mysteries, personal and courtroom drama this is for you. Recommended by many people--they were correct!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Me gusta el juego.  Es algo adictivo.  Es un reto obtener una estrellita cada vez que lo haces perfecto.  Es muy bueno para niños pequeños.  Es de agilidad mental.
B004OR199G|5.0|Excellent book and her blog keeps moving with the beat. Great way to start new habits with you own cheerleader! Kris Carr raises all boats.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|SO easy to love some and hate the others they do such an outstanding job! Many story lines to follow and they get you involved with ALL the characters using everyone in the cast for the most part and I very much enjoy it.
B002E2M5IC|4.0|...There is merit in being  familiar with the jewish experience to really appreciate this film, however I'm not sure it's a complete prerequisite..  This film explores man's struggle with faith/ life/ relationships and life  in general.  I think it's well done, others may differ...decide for yourself.
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|There are lots of clocks more interesting than this one.  It's OK, but cold feeling.  Test it if you can, but I don't think you'll be impressed...
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|We received this earlier than expected which was great.  I have always loved this movie and was delighted to be able to secure a copy of it, on Blu-Ray no  less!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This really works on my Kindle Fire.  Kind of spooky.  Can access my desktop from anywhere instantly.  I haven't actually found a use for it other than to amaze myself, but it does as promised....
6303314015|3.0|I did not purchase this vhs movie.  It's a great movie but we already have a vhs version.  We might purchase it on Blu-ray sometime.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|There are lots of clocks more interesting than this one.  It's OK, but cold feeling.  Test it if you can, but I don't think you'll be impressed...
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Loved everything about the characters and story but the only thing that bothered me is the missing part I expected to go through with Lake. Felt like there was a missing puzzle piece.
B007FY9ZWI|3.0|The Rocket is fine.  Not sure it's any better than what comes the Kindle Fire anyway,  But it's free.  That's it....
B002ZG999U|5.0|I Bought this as a Christmas gift. Great movie with all the orginal action sars. Awesome movie for the gut raised during the action movie era!
B004U52VPS|3.0|My son enjoys this game quite a bit. However, some of the structures are really difficult (if not impossible) to build. I have to sit with him and build each one for him, since balancing the pieces can be a challenge.
B00B49L7Y4|5.0|Searching for Sugar Man is one of the BEST movies, let alone documentaries, that I have seen in the last 20 years.  Incredible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Takes you mind away of everything! Great work out for your brain! Hard but the more you play the better it gets changing the characters is fun too!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Xoxoxoxoxoxoxoxo
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like using this app for sleep.  I would like to see even more sounds available.  The page with sounds for relaxation, concentration, and presleep is worth using!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I wanted a simple to use, easy to access notepad with no frills. This one fills the bill well. It is easy to create and great for to do and shopping with easy to check off items when created the right way. I'd recommend it to anyone needing the same.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I am a huge fan of Child and Preston and these last 3 books that created the trilogy about Pendergasts wife were each and everyone compelling stories with one and two leaving you desperate to read the next book. Each book can be read as a stand alone novel but if you have not read Fever Dreams and Cold Vengeance I would highly recommend you do so. Some great reading for Pendergast fans. Enjoy!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I always loved kindle, but the ability to put it on my smart phone as well as my droid tablet made it even better. I used to read on my laptop, but the ability to read wherever I am makes it even better.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it was ok. it was a lilttle bit hard but I am liking it. if you like this game then you should try pride claw. my lilttle girl loves this game and prize claw. you should try them both
0143120255|5.0|Me encanta este libro, me ha llegado en excelentes condiciones y con un tiempo perfecto de entrega. Lo recomiendo! Gracias
B009UX2YAC|4.0|okay so it already has like 5 stars so I shouldn't have to say anything I LOVE IT THOUGH I would like to change a few things about but most importantly I took of part of that star because on my kindled fire it atamatically updated every. time and erased my stats
B0091REZMW|5.0|Not bad so far. Still getting the feel. Wish it wasn't wanting FB and Twitter info. Would love to just play without prompts.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|I really love the way the Spirit can influence the mind and the way the mind controls the body in the the way it was created to be! It is a very positive affirmation of life and I am thankful for Dr. Joseph Murphy sharing of such a beautiful way of living your life and his profound belief in God's wonders.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  It was the tiniest bit slow-moving, but it was pretty good.  A nice, lighthearted movie to pass the time.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I couldn't stop reading.  It is a powerful book full of emotion. Highly recommended. It ventures into the unspoken world of sexual abuse on innocent victims.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun,addictive and really passes the time away during the long commute. I am new to playing it as my daughter turned me on to it...and I am glad she did.
B002R2HSRM|4.0|Entertaining visually with an interesting plot. Some trully outrageous scenes that are likely true because they are so outrageous. Well acted.

159315724X|4.0|To get the most out of this book, you'll want to download and complete the worksheets printed in the back of the book and  available online (at thecompoundeffect dot com).<br /><br />There are:<br /> * Gratitude Assessment<br /> * Core Values Assessment<br /> * Life Assessment<br /> * Habit Assessment<br /> * Weekly Rhythm Register<br /> * Input Influences<br /> * Association Evaluator<br /><br />This is rich stuff and in my experience worth the time and effort. By working with these exercisess you will gain clarity and a new level of intentionality about what you do with your life.<br /><br />I do take issue with the Input Influences worksheet. Darren Hardy wants you to avoid CNN, Time magazine, daily newspapers and all such sources of news except a few carefully selected RSS feeds for news about topics that affect you directly. The idea is you don't need to feed your mind with information about negative events that you can do nothing about. My issue is that I do not buy into Hardy's extremely constricted definition of what we can influence. Essentially he is advocating a vow of current-events abstenance. But if all the best, most competent and mindful people ignore war, violence, crime, corruption and genocide, will it all just go away? To pick an extreme example, in every case of genocide, there are perpetrators, bystanders and rescuers. He would have us consciously choose to be bystanders, blissful in our ignorance, not just of genocide, but of every other terrible thing going on in the world. There are many ways we can affect what is wrong in the world. Voting is only the first of many that come to mind. We also influence those around us and we have much influence through our choices as consumers and perhaps as investors. Hardy has no use for rubberneckers, but sometimes when you see a house in flames, you may be able to help.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love Subway Surfers . I've been playing for a month now. This game tops all my apps.Like Temple Run that shows it's pretty boss.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think there should be a temple run 3. Guy Dangerous meets a professor after a run from the giant gorilla in the northern parts. Professor D'Amp creates a time machine for Guy Dangerous to travel back in time. Unfortunately, The giant gorilla found Guy Dangerous and the professor.. It kills the professor. He travels back in the dinosaur age and finds mutated money's and animals chasing him through a temple. There will be water he has to swim to get across or can either jump. The fire will come out of a mini volcano. The coins can be the original color or can start in multiple colors. Other than TR3, Temple Run 2 is better the original, but none is best. I think they are equal but with different backgrounds. Have fun everyone!

1416583432|5.0|This is a good book that really gives us as humans a better insight to how dogs operate.  It is full of interesting facts and the author does a good job with relating the science to her own personal dog.  I recommend it for any dog lovers out there who want to better understand the inner workings of their pups.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|For some reason I thought this movie was about something else than it was.  I was a bit disappointed in this.  It has a lot of lesbian sexual incidents in it.  Just a strange movie overall.

B0017O1MIM|5.0|I've seen Lawrence of Arabia many times. It's beautifully filmed, directed and acted. This box set is amazing. It comes in a nicely designed box with three Blu-ray disks and a CD. The first Blu-ray disk contains a new restoration of the entire film, along with intermission. The other two Blu-ray disks contain lots of bonus material. The CD contains the soundtrack with a couple of previously unreleased tracks. The included book contains lots of photos of the making of the film and a description of the difficulties overcome in getting the rights to produce it, cast it and film it in very challenging locations. There is even a mounted individually numbered 70 mm frame of the movie. The Blu-ray image and sound quality of the film is incredible.<br /><br />The box set was worth the wait.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|This CD is Music at it's best. Adele sounds like a person that really enjoys her singing, it makes you want to just sit and enjoy all day long.
B006K3796E|5.0|My nearly 9yo son got this as a gift and he plays with it constantly. About the only thing that will sway him away is being able to play Minecraft and that says a lot. It's challenging but not so difficult that he can't master it. We all love it. It's mesmerizing!
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|a great point and click game.  challenging without being too complicated. would like to see more like it.  a good buy
1451638450|5.0|I don't think there's a LMB book that I disliked, but this one is just great--easily right up there with A Civil Campaign, which in my opinion is the best Vorkosigan book yet.<br /><br />No spoilers here, but I do want to mention that like A Civil Campaign, LMB takes a romance trope that's been done to death and turns it into something fresh and hilariously funny.  Ivan's talent for landing in trouble no matter how much he tries to avoid it is a continuing theme, but fortunately luck is with him and it all comes out right in the end.<br /><br />Ivan is a sufficiently developed character that he carries being the focus of the story nicely, and his efforts to work his way out of his predicament have the predictably laugh-out-loud results. If you loved Civil Campaign, this one is a must-read.
B009AMANH4|5.0|\\"Lincoln\\" is brilliant! This is how the story goes: In a nation divided by war and the strong winds of change, Lincoln pursues a course of action designed to end the war, unite the country and abolish slavery. With the moral courage and fierce determination to succeed, his choices during this critical moment will change the fate of generations to come.<br /><br />The cast led by Daniel Day-Lewis (impressive in his Oscar-winning, well-crafted performance as Lincoln), Sally Field (superb in her Oscar-nominated performance as Mary Todd Lincoln) & Tommy Lee Jones (also superb in his Oscar-nominated performance as Thaddeus Stevens) is brilliant. The directing by Steven Spielberg (Oscar-nominated) (also produced) is brilliant. The screenplay (based in part on the book \\"Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln\\" by Doris Kearns Goodwin) by Tony Kushner (Oscar-nominated) is brilliant.<br /><br />The music by John Williams (Oscar-nominated) is brilliant. The cinematography by Janusz Kaminski (Oscar-nominated) is brilliant. The film editing by Michael Kahn (Oscar-nominated) is brilliant. The casting by Avy Kaufman is brilliant. The production design by Rick Carter (Oscar-winning) is brilliant. The art direction (Oscar-winning) by Curt Beech, David Crank & Leslie McDonald is brilliant. The set decoration by Jim Erickson (Oscar-winning) & Peter T. Frank, set dressings by Alex Brandenburg, Steven Harris, Keith S. Jackson, Beth Morris, Rick Reeder, Jane Sakowski, Eric Luling & Billy Stearne, set designs by Jim Hewitt is brilliant. The costume design by Joanna Johnston (Oscar-nominated) is brilliant. The make-up effects supervised by Leo Corey Castellano is brilliant. The special effects coordinated by Steve Cremin is brilliant. The visual effects supervised by Gavin Miljkovich & Ben Morris, coordinated by John Szebegyinski is brilliant. The stunts coordinated by Garrett Warren is brilliant.<br /><br />This is a well-crafted and well-made film that is brilliant and entertaining. Daniel Day-Lewis gives another Oscar-worthy and contending performance that is brilliantly well-crafted and well-done, a performance (awards consideration deserving that is has received, thus far) that is sure to give him (which did, give him) his third Best Actor Oscar, the second in the last five years. Sally Field & Tommy Lee Jones just about match him in performance quality, gives superb crafted and well-done performances that are both deserving of the awards consideration that they have received to date, thus far, just like Daniel Day-Lewis has. This is one of the best films of Steven Spielberg's career and is also one of the best films of the recently done holiday season that began on Thanksgiving last year and ended, of course, on New Year's this year. This is also one of the best films of last year, well deserving of its critical and audience acclaim and also its awards consideration it has gotten to date, thus far, including the 12 Oscar nominations the film has received, possibly being the main highlight of the awards acclaim and consideration that the film has gotten to date.
B008I34ZFW|2.0|On a dystopian future Earth, the ruling cabal of morons defeat a nazi lunar invasion (with revolting smug PC homilies thrown in along the way), leaving the moon with a huge chunk shot out of it. Which in itself would of course destroy life down here...<br /><br />The script has a lot of clever little touches (lines from history [e.g. the Germans' 1939 justification for war with Poland], references to films like Downfall and The Great Dictator, snippets from Wagner), and the Nazis' lunar aesthetic is conceived in fine style.<br /><br />But as the film is made as a light-hearted romp, it needs to establish characters for the audience to identify with - it fails badly here. Taking pot shots at corrupt, media-manipulating, please-everyone policians is fine, but the repulsiveness of their characters drives us into the Nazis' camp, and their leading characters are traitors to their own cause - are we meant to sympathise with the untainted loyal Moon Nazis? We don't get much reason to dislike them, and their singlemindedness, scientific prowess and discipline are, as always, impressive. And, of course, they have the best uniforms.<br /><br />I ended up sort of hoping the Nazis would triumph over their vapid politically correct foes! But it was not to be, and the film runs out of steam at the end, after the obligatory cliched big battle...
B0098G67TU|5.0|Let me put this on the record - the HD streaming version is an updated version of the original release.<br /><br />I liked the movie when it came out, but after watching it at home over the weekend on a big HD TV I feel it's probably the best movie experience I've ever had - on a par with watching the original Star Wars movies back in the theatre in the late 1970s/early 1980s. Yeah, it's that good.
B00005RDSM|4.0|This arrived in record time and my kids love this movie!  The movie sticks at the start but it only lasts a few seconds before it plays again.  Overall a great buy & thanks to the seller for shipping this so fast.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|Take your history and throw it out the window - this movie was great fun and doesn't pretend to be anything else which is why I like it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|A very quick read with lots of twists to the plot.  When you think you have it figured out, think again!  I could not put it down.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love these characters would recommend this to any fan of this time period.  I downloaded the instant video and it was very good.
0375850864|5.0|When \\"You Reach Me\\" is the type of book you have to tear yourself away from in order to get anything done! It is the story of Miranda, a sixth grade girl growing up in New York city in the 1970s.  When Miranda starts receiving mysterious notes her life begins to change and the reader gets hooked!<br />This book is great read for even the most reluctant readers.  The plot will keep readers wanting to know more and wondering what strange thing will happen to her next!
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Funny adult comedy and very unique!! Definitely not a children's movie! Not at all what you'd expect from a teddy bear!
B00633W614|5.0|Jeffrey Archer is such a wonderful story teller.  This book, as all of his, make for easy reading.  Bad guys generally (and in this case for sure) get what is due them.  Loved it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|There is so much more to the story than any adaption can cover. To their credit: Alister Sim's version, Albert Finney's musical performance, and George C. Scott's performance are commendable (Bill Murray in Scrooged was humourous, but...). However, lIke any adaption they must edit for timing so I recommend a thourough reading and re-reading of A Christmas Carol.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|the game its self is well organized but whenever I collect a jewel and want to use it I click the button my kindle freezes then goes to the home page!  I click on the game again and it says I have never had any jewels.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Everyone else has said it. But I have to add my \\"+1\\".<br /><br />This book has a lot of concepts most of us already know, but instead of the standard textbook approach, the authors have chosen to hide these concepts in a fictional narrative. Doing so, there are times it jumps off the page and screams. We've been in some of these meetings, we've worked with most of these people, you will identify with the characters and concepts in the book (both good and bad).<br /><br />It's corny on occasion, the story line is a bit forced, and the ending is a little to happily ever after.... but just reading an IT/Devops handbook written in such an approachable manor is refreshing. And being so approachable, the concepts jump off the page.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to any C level exec wanting to understand Devops and of course anyone in IT/Systems/DevOps/Etc<br /><br />+1

B000VNMMQG|5.0|A must see movie. It is inspirational. You will not be disappointed. This is a story of courage and conviction. We simply do not have these type of leaders in the world today. We still have the people who argue that our economy cannot afford to do the right thing.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I chose this book because I LOVED Colleen Hover's &#34;Hopeless&#34; so I wanted to read more from this authur and was NOT disappointed in another great book of hers.  I love the humor she puts in her books even though the characters went through tuff times.  I would HIGHLY reccommend this and all of Colleen Hover's books!!!

0547848412|4.0|I re-read Life of Pi recently in preparation for seeing the film and I remembered why I fell in love with it in the first place. Although the first part is quite slow starting, there are some hilarious moments - especially the parts with the three religious leaders. But the book really comes into its own after the ship wreck. Although not a lot happens plot-wise I found the story completely gripping, and I read it pretty much in one sitting.<br /><br />If you have seen the film without reading the book, you are missing out, because although the film was very faithful and was spectacular to look at on screen, the book has so much more to give. It is a story that will leave you reflecting on life, spirituality, love and story-telling and it is both humorous and heart-breaking all in one. If you haven't read it already you should make it your top priority!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love this story!  It's a romantic love story that reminds you of why you fell in love in the first place (for those of us married for awhile).  This one is a page turner with suspense built in as well!

B004HD61KE|4.0|This is my first novel by this author. Very good as the other reviews have stated. I learned some and it made me dig deeper into American history to see if what was stated in the book was true or not. It was.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|For me, this set creates/completes a live trilogy (of sorts) between Live in Europe 1967 Vol.1, Live in Europe Vol.2 1969 and It's About That Time Live March 7th 1970. I am of course referencing the events leading up to the transformation of Miles as bandleader and cultural sophisticate to that of the Dark Magus. Writing this short review, in my mind I hear the final washes of sound upon the shores of Pangea (the live 1975 album recorded in Japan which would be the last voice of the \\"Magus\\" period).  To be direct, this \\"trilogy\\" is about the shift from chief to shaman. Shorter is the thread that weaves this transition.  I don't think Miles could have done this without him.  Perhaps I seem him as a protector, a loyal friend, a psychopomp to take him from one realm unto another.<br /><br />I love Vol.1 in the bootleg series. A persistent image, inelegant as it may be, that resides in my mind is that of cosmic river otters at play -- the runs and lines and eddies of sound are so free, natural and unfettered by time. The second impression of the second quintet is that of trust.  Musically, the sense of trust is palpable.  No one is left to fall. That which slows will be propelled, that which quickens will be given a soft landing, excursions are open and unconstrained send-offs heartfelt while returns are welcomed with refrains...<br /><br />Vol.2 drifts into deeper and electric water. This is the transition that has been talked about in numerous reviews and essays. It will end with primal sacrifice music that goes deep into the collective DNA. In Live in Euorpe 1969 though, the reason that Miles could delve, and by delve I mean delve, into the \\"past\\" with moments such as \\"No Blues\\" and why this is considered a transitional period versus a jump into the abyss is the fact that as out-there and independent as Corea, Holland and DeJohnette can be,they play with an understated humility and respect for the art, obviously not afraid of the future, but reverent of the living past.  Miles had to be responding to this quality that these musicians embodied. Many people may be coming to this set from the \\"future\\" since the live material of the 1970s has been available for some time. Others may be coming from the past from the rise of the two great quintets.  Both, I think, will be happy here in this intertidal zone.
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Great &#34;classic&#34; syle horror! The ending is pretty shocking and may leave some viewers upset. One of the better Stephen King adaptions.

B000HWZ5VU|5.0|Pictures at 11 is one of Robert Plants greatest solo efforts. The songs are well crafted and the musicianship is top-notch!<br />His voice is one of the best in the business!! Do not hesitate to include this gem as part of your music collection!!

B00785P2QC|3.0|its an ok game. cool to kill time. only thing that Sufis is that u have to wait for energy.
B0099Y2YL6|2.0|First, let me start by saying I absolutely am in love with Downton Abbey and was so anticipating my copy of season 3.  It arrived promptly, on the release date, and my husband and I sat together to watch throughout the week.  I will not speak to the story because many others have done due diligence, I'm simply commenting on 3 issues:<br /><br />First, the English subtitles are tiny, really tiny!  My husband is deaf and typically utilizes closed captioning, but since this was available with SDH, we thought it would not be an issue.  The subtitles are very difficult to read, even on a larger TV.  If you are a person who utilizes this feature be forewarned that you'll be paying far more attention to the subtitles than normal and will probably have to watch an episode at least twice to catch all the dialogue.<br /><br />Second, after watching all the episodes on the disc, I thought I'd see how the they compared to the PBS version that is available online.  I started watching Episode 5 and within a few minutes realized that there are portions cut out from the Masterpiece version online (same as broadcast on TV).  One example is the scene with Robert & Cora in her bedroom after the funeral, he says good night, she says good night to him in the online version, that is missing from this disc.  At breakfast the next day there are multiple portions of scenes cut, including some with the servants downstairs and with Branson upstairs.<br /><br />Third, there is nothing in the case expect the outside graphics sheet.  No explanation of how long the episodes are, no episode guide, no description at all.  For such a popular series this is certainly a stripped down version of what is an excellent show.<br /><br />I'm sorely disappointed that I paid to get this disc and now I will be contacting Amazon with my displeasure over these issues. 2 stars because of the lack of acceptable subtitles and the cut version of the series that you'll be receiving if you purchase this.
0425263916|5.0|Sylvia Day's books are well written.  Read both of this series in a couple days each.  Good story.  Preordered the next one!

B0025KVLTW|5.0|I had bought this for my husband.  He is a fan of their music.  It brought back many good memories or him.
0765325950|5.0|Finally I have closure with this series. I loved it! It answered just about all of my questions and those that remain unanswered are probably better served by my imagination. Who knows? Maybe we'll get further stories in the future. Either way, this was my favorite series of all time and one of the only set that I can read over and over again.
B0058YPILY|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.  I watch it in my spare time.  I can hardly wait to get the 8th season.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I just simply loved that movie.  I never thought Channing Tatum turned out to be a great dancer.....no wonder, he used to be a stripper while living in Tampa, FL and also, I am from Tampa, FL.  BUT I have never heard of him until he made big in various movies.  That's how he met his wife!!  Anyone (who loves music or dancing or both) should see this movie!!  I would have given this movie TEN stars!!  :)
B00915G6SU|5.0|This is one of my favorite series to watch.  I have yet to receive this particular season (8th) but I know it will be good.

B006YM9JSW|5.0|This product is lightning fast and allows me to run multiple apps at the same time. Setting up my computer I was installing multiple programs at the same time, downloading files and transfering files all that the same time and didn't notice a single hiccup. Also it runs quite cool (32-34c with not much stress on it and proper cooling).<br /><br />The only drawback with this I found was that I had to spend a bit more on the motherboard because it requires an LGA 2011 socket. However, I think in the long run this will probably end up being better because of upgrade ability (LGA 1155 slot is pretty much done for, and most future processors are coming out as LGA 2011).<br /><br />At any rate, this is a great processor and will probably allow me to run a super fast system for the next 5 years or so.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|So i was looking at a bunch of different bags online and I really wanted one with my Camera's brand logo and then when I stumbled onto this bag i was reading review and someone made a really good point. This bag look like an ordinary back pack that doesn't scream &#34;STEAL ME&#34;. I holds my camera body, 55-250 lens, 40mm lens, 18-55 lens, battery grip, and i still have room for one large lens and my flash i plan to get soon. Thats just what I can fit in the open portion. It has 2 zipper pockets that fit filters and various wires and such and it has a mediocre size pouch on the front for other odds and ends.

B009AMANBA|3.0|Abraham Lincoln, a man known for being terse when it counted, would no doubt be surprised at the blather this movie has inspired among viewers. Lewis was great, but I don't think the role was that demanding for him once he got the voice down. Sally Fields was over the top, but Tommy Lee Jones is brilliant, in a role that is right in his rough-tough-intellectual wheelhouse. But as a movie? Seems to me the buzz around Lincoln, even though the cinematography is vividly period,  is more about what it represents in our history than how it works as a drama.
B0001KL5DA|1.0|When I received my new, shrink wrapped discs they all had finger prints (not sure how that happens on \\"new\\" items ) and scratches. The fifth disc is also so badly scratched. Not very happy with the item received.

B002VWNIAY|5.0|In my top three favorite movies of all time. I could watch it a million times and never get tired of it. The performances by everyone are outstanding. Humor, romance and drama ... What more could you ask for?
B004SBS8LA|4.0|I like this game, easy, simple but very fun, it is very good for little kid, good picture and look pretty.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It's one of the most hysterical ones I've ever seen and Hugh Grant makes you roll on the floor laughing when he breaks into his dance. I love him!!! I had to have it for my collection to watch over and over again.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|great character development as per usual for Baldacci<br />but a new character and and new emotions for that character<br />-A great read
B0019UGYK0|5.0|Personally this is my favorite Paul Newman movie and that's saying a lot as I love them all. The movie was brand new and I've watched it twice since receiving it.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|My kids (boys 12 &9; and girll 5) enjoyed Hotel Transylvania but not really Paranorman so we waited to give this a try. My 9 & 5 year old liked it but not my 12 year old. They liked the humor and the funny characters. My 12 didn't like the black and white. My wife and I got the references so it was good all around. It's always good when a kids' movie tones down the body humor gags.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Couldn't put down! Laugh out loud funny! Hilarious! Can't wait to read more from this author!  I so loved it!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Played this game on my Kindle Fire for two days and absolutely loved it. All of a sudden, after having never experienced a single problem, the game became jerky and lagging. I closed the program only to have it never open again. The only way to play now is to uninstall / reinstall...every. time. And you gave to start all over...where's the fun in that? I do hope they fix the problem soon...this game is so fun I would have gladly paid for it wgen it worked. Disappointed.
0920668372|5.0|This book is for a small boy to be read to by his mom. It's a book that is repetitive. Therefore, he can read the repetitive lines with Mom. It's so traditional that my son & and I write the main lines on cards to each other to this day. My son is about to be 23 and will be married about a week before that.<br />  I change the words to say,&#34;I'll love you forever,<br />  I'll like you for always, as long as I'm living my baby you' ll be.&#34;<br />I am giving it to him to use with his child
B001BNFR6W|1.0|Purchased this set as a gift for a friend. More than half of the DVDs will not play! Total waste of money. The DVDs skip, pause and will not move forward, or just flat out will not play. I have tried to play them in a DVD player, computer and even an XBox 360. They are completely worthless. So disappointed! Do not waste your money. I could not get the company that made them to replace them.
0694003611|5.0|I would suggest getting the rabbit with the blue and white striped outfit to give the child while reading the book to him/her.<br />  This book is about a typical rabbit that does NOT want to go to sleep at night. Therefore, the rabbit starts telling things goodnight. It begins to get . The rabbit is trolling EVERYTHING goodnight!
0979019710|5.0|I absolutely love this book.  The past few years, I have not been a morning person.  Thanks to following The Miracle Morning, I am now!  I highly recommend it!!
B002PZC8BM|5.0|All you Blakjack and Holdem Players will love this Episode.  Discription of how to count cards in blackjack was interesting concept.
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|This was an impulse buy, but after hearing the samples, I had to have it. Kind of like Keb Mo meets the Black Keys.
B008C20TDG|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in nutrition and how food affects the body and your life.
B003XQM2YU|4.0|Russell Crowe was compelling as usual in this backstory of Robin of the Hood. It was a beautiful glimpse into the struggles of 12th century England, with gorgeous photography.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|It is a cute game to kill time while waiting in line or during commercials. For any age and gender.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|just like the movie but better. I like how it has the audio already in the book but not very much expression.
B005Z5F5VE|5.0|A different U2 then you're used to, but still top notch stuff. Electric guitar and riffs highlight this great album.
B0085RQLXK|4.0|This was a Xmas gift for my husband.  I heard the reviews on NPR, and the updated version of some of Aerosmith's songs are good; it's too bad Tyler abused his voice, but he knows that, so I can't be too harsh.
0345803485|5.0|A nice way to exchange christmas and birthday presents.<br />You need to look closely at a better way to reduce the postal charges to Australia.
B008QTV3X0|5.0|Excellent show !! Each episode gets better and better and very climatic ending. Best series I have ever seen on television!
B008HK3XU4|3.0|it can only be used as a stand  as pictured thought it could also be used upright  its okay but i'm a little disappointed since more of my usage is when it is upright
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was the best book in the world. A love, action story. It may be complex for children, however. Anyway, I would xxx never sleep because I would be up reading t all night. After reading it, I would just lay there thinking about it. I'm solo sad it's the final book :( YOU NEED TO READ IT!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enthralling! Completely sweeps you away into another world and another time. Simply the best thing I have ever watched on television!
B00005JNQS|5.0|we got the item before we, were suppose to get it and it was taken care of well. my sons were very happy when i open.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It's a good game but it's buggy I had five gems but when I pressed save me it froze , took me to home and when I pressed the app it said I had -1 yes I said -1 gems then one time when I started running it became blank an I was running when I didn't press anything.
B005CRQ3IE|4.0|Everything is almost<br /><br /> great. The only two things that could make it better is a: shorten the introduction and b: add more descriptions of magical creatures. That is why I rated this book only 4 stars.  (Kid review)
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Never thought it could get any better than season 3. It did. Best I have ever seen. Great t v
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I read this book after I read the authors other book Hopeless because I just wanted more!! I really enjoyed this story and the characters in it! It's not just another high school love story!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|My 5 year old boy loves this movie. He can watch it over and over! It is a good movie to watch for the whole family.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|This is a great cover and an excellent fit!!  I bought it to protect my son's new Kindle that he uses in special ed and it's just what he needs to keep it safe during the day and prop it up for his desk work.  Great design and sturdy too!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Good movie with interesting twists and turns.  Ending was unexpected.  I would suggest this movie to others, violence was not too bad.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter`s 6th birthday and she likes it! Very pleased, got it within a day of ordering, so, I am very satisfied!
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I use it all the time.  I have to add 14 more words for this review to be accepted.  (the word &#34;accepted&#34; was the 14th word, yea!)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book was so well written it is unbelieveable. It is probably one of my favorite books.In my opinion, this book is actually underpriced.It is worth so much more! I am at a loss for words because it is so wonderful!!!
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I was going to copy &#34;Must Read&#34; to all the lines. This book is definitely something that should be studied in schools; just to be sure most are ready to face the world and strive to become better citizens.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very good. The graphics are very good and the gameplay is worthy of 5 stars. The music is also as good.
B000BJ7BCU|5.0|This movie is great entertainment for kids, expecially on long car trips and plane rides.  Great for kids and there imagination.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is a very amazing book with a surprising twist! A real thriller. A must have on any book shelf.
B009M7G1PU|5.0|I would consider this book a highly valuable read for anyone interested in classic novels, humanity, love, romance, sex, self-discovery, or any other aspect of the human journey.  A deep exploration of sexual discovery and philosophy, as well as a view into the mores of the early 20th century.  The prose is lovely and filled with subtlety.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|The game is very enjoyable however my Kindle fire has trouble loading the app. I have to go in and out several times before the game will load properly.
B001I8A76A|5.0|Awesome album!  Love or at least like each song very much!  Her style has evolved and matured a lot since her first cd, which wasn't a b bad debut to begin with.
B009CG11WY|5.0|One of the best movies of all time...the quality is pretty darn good for an 80's film!  Thanks for being able to deliver this quality...
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|awesome  and a little creepy but fun u should get it if i where u it is out of your world
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Love the streaming featues instead of waiting on a DVD. My sons love this show and purchased these a few at a time.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|disappointed with the plot and one liners. Van Dam sucked as the bad guy. Guess he be good at selling sun glasses.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|every time I play I always get kicket out of the game it is part of the people that made it
B00846REIS|5.0|My sister recommended this book after I read 50 Shades.  She was right.  While the books are similiar, this one is better due to the little nuances (or lack thereof). Can't wait for the 2nd one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I've been playing minecraft since 2010 and I was really exited when I saw that it was on kindle fire. But The Ipad got 0.6.1 already and I WANT IT NOW.
B004Q0R7FG|5.0|Got my son a train set for Christmas and thought Koko came with it but it didn't and he was asking for her. He is super happy that she is here and has so much fun playing with her.
B008C20TDG|5.0|easy to read and understand, this book is clear as to why eating for your health is important in this time of GMO foods. It explains everything from good fats to why dairy isn't good for our bodies. I found it very easy to read meaning I wasn't bored, it kept me interested.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I've read all three now and they are all three quite riveting. none so much as the first, but as sequels go, this was a good one. it's time now to put Katniss Everdeen to bed and come up with another killer plot. read all three and read them in order for the fullest effect.
B009HEJXFS|2.0|I paid to watch Men in Black 3, but half way through the movie it froze up. I checked my internet and everything was fine. The actual server froze. My problem is that I am a loyal customer and I have never experienced any issue before. I don't know if &#34;cheated&#34; is the actual term that I would use for this event, but I did not receive what I paid for and that being the movie that I requested and paid for... I would like to see the movie without having to pay for it again. Right is right,.. Right?!?!/
B0076DCT2G|5.0|and this one was no exception. I like the John Corey character and really liked the depth of the trek into darkest Yemen to root out the bad guys and do right for the American way. ok, sure, it's all somewhat predictable, but DeMille takes the ordinary and puts a relevant and humorous spin on it. forever DeMille!!!!! bring on the next one....and please: what's with this 48 page &#34;mini&#34; stuff????we need 5, 6, 700 pages of thrills.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|Why does this app need my phone call info? Why does it want access to my sd card to delete?
B00122HW92|4.0|Very refreshing to hear them live again. Nice guitar solos. It must have been an interesting et of shows to see live
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is beautiful,good graphics,and is exciting and fun.So if you do not like the game you are crazy or paralyzed
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this version of the game. I love the new layout and the different ways to get power UPS and that you can revive after you have died.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|Still entertaining though, but characters weren't as compelling or sympathetic. Not really scary and often just silly. The devil wasn't very formidable.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Always loved this game I even have it on my computer. When I saw it I said that's one I want.
B002E8B212|5.0|A smokin recording with Albert passing the torch on to Stevie, and describing what he thinks of the current blues being played, and where he sees himself in the blues's future.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|it keeps my mind sharp, which is good for a person my age. And it is ggod for when you are waiting for time to pass.
193413712X|4.0|very nice customer service..rec'd the book quickly and in good shape just as the advertisement described it. Now to read..thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game everrrr! The graphics are awesome and everything is perfect except for the ads that pop up but who cares!! This game is friggin awesomeee
B00A8ECU24|1.0|This game would not even open once on my Kindle Fire. I tried uninstalling it and everything, with no luck. Thank goodness it was a free app or I would be VERY upset.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Fun that's really the only way to explain this app. I wish that it would give more instructions. Other than it is good.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My 4 year old grand kids love it. I haven't had a chance to play it yet but it looks pretty easy to pick up.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|As always I enjoyed this book very much.I remember when Kennedy was killed even though I was very young. Stephen King can do no wrong!<br /><br />kimdevore
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was great. I couldn't put it down. Best love story/drama I've read in a long time. I would suggest this to anyone.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I like this book because is really funny and understanding..<br />I recommend this book to all teenagers that this book is really good..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have yet to be disappointed in a Nicholas Sparks book.  I have read them all. I am waiting for his next one.
B006JSXYPA|5.0|All right excellent, in very good condition and very fast great price for four disk, and 3D is espetacular.<br />I will keep buying movies in 3D.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|.  The book was outstanding and hard to put down.  I will continue reading her books.  It is well written.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|All right excellent, in very good condition and very fast great price for four disk, and 3D is espetacular.<br />I will keep buying movies in 3D.
B008M87GJK|5.0|Very useful, beautiful, easy to navigate.  Love it.  and for free  . .  . . . . . . .
B003MOHX8S|5.0|This is powerful music.  I play it when I want to feel powerful.  It take me outside of myself to seeing things from a bigger perspective.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Story is predictable, but that is why people read romance stories. You can tell it was written by a woman because the guy is what every woman wants their guy to be; he wants her and values her morales and mind. Pure fantasy.
1600597963|5.0|Love this book.  I can expand what I'm already doing.  I have been beading cabs for 5 years now and this book has given me all sorts of new ideas.
B00APUQJLO|3.0|This movie was worth seeing....I rented it on my Kindle. I would suggest a rental before a purchase.<br />The acting was good but the story was what prompted the 3 star rating.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Love love love this book. Just wanted to keep reading it until I finished it. Really would appeal to a wide age group range.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I was a little unhappy about the fact that the author kind of forced you to buy this book with the way he wrote the last two books of the series, however I love the story and would have bought another book in the series in any case.  This one is like the rest tying up some of the loose ends from the rest of the story but leaving enough room for more.
B000007T1M|5.0|I was so super surprised on how fast I got the CD! It had no scratches and it plays perfect!
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|Not necessarily the easiest film to watch after the recent CT school shooting, but it probably will have its value at another time. The film's point is that a \\"random\\" shooting may, in fact, be masking a larger conspiracy. To say more would certainly take-away from the story. JR is a more thoughtful film than one would initially give it credit. I just don't think that many would want to think about these possibilities right now...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much I would like to just ride a horse . I love this app because it is like you really own a horse
B00AIBZLVY|4.0|A truly well done, appropriately PG-13, \\"really spooky movie\\" though it may well be too much for kids below that age.  Two little kids whose own parents have arguably abandoned/failed them are saved and protected by tormented soul in the woods.  But can this \\"mama\\" let go when they are finally found?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's exactly like temple run. Fun, relaxing, and challenging, it's one of the best games I ever played.<br />So enjoyable and exciting, it gets me scared whenever I graze a train while running from the cop.
B00B769XB8|2.0|I get the film's Robert Downey Jr \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" gadget-rich/toying-with-anachronism concept and if the film-makers had just toned down the needless blood / splatter and \\"reworked\\" a truly odd (honestly, why was it there...?) nude scene, it would have made for a great PG-13 film. Instead, they chose to turn the Grimm Brothers' story into a _needlessly_ blood-and-guts covered film (adding little if anything to the story...) evoking the worst of The Matrix / Quentin Tarantino films (where even the Matrix and more recent Tarantino films employed their violence/more graphic imagery for a purpose). So why did the makers of this film choose to make a film such a needless splatter fest? Only they would know...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. Fun for all ages. If you like games that make you think, this is the game for you
B005S9ELVC|2.0|A story \\"inspired by true events\\" about an \\"off the books\\" squad of LAPD officers sent to go after the gangster Mickey Cohen. The problem is that Cohen's downfall didn't come in the way that the movie shows. So GS may have more in common with \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit?\\" than with actual history. I'd accept the violence of the film if it was at least truly based on the facts. Since it was not, the ending of the film IMHO becomes silly.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I did not like the start of the book and nearly stopped reading it but as the plot moved along it improved, in my opinion
B0090SI4HO|1.0|What Arnold finds himself doing these days ;-). Unfortunately this is a really _needlessly_ gory (not just \\"broken glass\\" but \\"heads blown to pieces...\\") film and the racial messaging is really quite appalling (whites are generally good and certainly strong, non-whites alternatively incompetent, comically cowardly or just plain Evil...). It's all kinda sad when one thinks that Arnold's had to play his share of foreign accented villains in his day...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome I play this game 24/7 everyday this is my favorite game on my kindle other people like my friends love this game too and the other game I ever played is streaker run and this game
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Certainly not a pretty story (lots of torture by any other name...) but a _compelling one_ about the woman CIA operative (and really a bunch of women CIA operatives) who had the stamina/endurance to focus on and finally get Bin Laden. The story could become a modern-day feminine equivalent of the story of the Tuskegee Airmen on World War II
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids have been playing this game for a while. I finally gave it a chance and instantly got addicted to the game as well.
B005DC68NI|5.0|I bought this to see if I was missing out on anything. In the self-publishing business we need all the help we can get. Here is a great book of ideas to help. If you only find one thing you are missing out on it might be just the ticket to boost sales. Thanks
B001E25MBK|5.0|Of course I loved all the movies and I'm glad I bought them in the set!  The 'extra' DVD that was included was amazing! After watching it, I realize how much time and effort the crew did to make the movies real!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Beautiful voice..beautiful music...I am very happy with my Adele 21. I play whenever I am in the car, thank you Amazon!
B009JBZH54|5.0|Big Batman fan. I could sit and watch the trilogy all day. And could not beat that price that it was going for. Great add for the collection
0345803485|5.0|I had heard so much &#34;gossip&#34; regarding this book that I went ahead and bought volume one, I finished it in a day, I am embarrassed to say, the next day my daughter showed up with the next 3 copies...
193413712X|5.0|I almost gave up on this book early on; it's hard to get into.  I only kept going on faith that the Pulitzer prize & accolades from some of my other favorite authors were merited.  It was so worth it.  I usually speed read to find out how books end.  This one has passages that took my breath away.  I had put the book down awhile to savor them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this. I was waiting for this in kindle version because I saw my friend had it on her smart phone.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Such an emotional book. Makes you feel both happy and sad. Even though it's written from the perspective of a 15 year old boy, anyone can relate. Quick read. Highly recommend it.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I originally got this on my phone for my daughter to pay and ended up playing it myself the computers are so fun!
B0046MOVD0|5.0|workd very good i greatly enjoyed the film no errors or issues was very clean and good to my collection
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Awesome. This was much less detailed than the first one. You really have to be spiritually together to read the first one. This one was much more balanced out when it came to the storyline.
B001GCUO16|5.0|workd very good i greatly enjoyed the film no errors or issues was very clean and good to my collection
B000O8OTNC|5.0|For a little pocket sharpener, this is an excellent product.  Great for a quick touch up for any size blade.  Obviously it won't compete with a $150 chefmate, but for what it is, it is terrific.  I brought it on our last hike and everyone borrowed it for their knives.  Wish I worked for them on commission - I could have sold 3 or 4 that day.
B0091REZMW|4.0|game is fine to play it works and doefnt seem to freeze much so play if you like search and find game
B00APJLFEG|4.0|Really enjoyed this. the whole family watched it 3x in the rental period. Thinking about buying this for a birthday gift.
B001NHNG64|4.0|These books are perfect travel reading. Fun, fast-paced, with a twist or two. Nothing too serious. Jack Reacher is Jason Bourne's blue collar cousin...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This keeps my whole family busy. What fun this game is. Even my husband has been known to play this from time to time. My kids are teasing to get the Start Wars version of this game. Maybe soon. It is creative, fun and helps to pass the time away. Love this game.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|This was one of the most incredible stories I've ever heard; the fact that it is a true story makes it all the more astounding. The documentary unfolds like a good book, and is very well done. This is a great movie for anyone, but especially fans of classic rock.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|A different twist on the Catholic exorcism, the movie was a little slow and then picked up the last thirty minutes of the movie. A better explanation the the divit box would have helped a whole lot, i.e the Omen the back story helped to explain Damian.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|Pretty scary look at our national food supply.  I'm definitely going organic and sustainable as much as possible, including raising my own free range eggs and grass-fed goat milk.
0307744434|5.0|When i first read the reviews about how the book is magical and that the circus lives on with you long after you finised the book,I was skeptical.But it's TRUE! I loved the book!It's one of those books you can't put down and you want to know what'll happen but you don't want it to end.I wish the night circus was real.Can't wait till the movie comes out.And I know I'll be wearing a red scarf when I go see it!:)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wonderful! Definatly a page turner. A book I would read again. An author I'll remember. Thanks amazon readers for the reviews
