B00004T8RK|3.0|There are enough reviews here that chances are, this will never be read.  I don't think it matters, this isn't really a particularly articulate review.  I personally am not in love with this album, and although Riot Act, Pearl Jam's more recent album, has grown on me quite a bit, I've got to say I don't think this one will.  I've listened through it over ten times, and yes, it has gotten better, but many of the tracks just don't have the richness that you expect from Pearl Jam.  I remember when I first listened to Ten, I felt the same way; this album does not have much depth, and it just sounds ugly.  What it had, though, was power.  Unfortunately, this album lacks that.  It just sounds depressing and dark.  It does have its highlights; Thin Air is a very impressive song, God's Dice is aditional proof that Jeff Ament can write some amazing songs (although Low Light, from Yield, is my favore song from Ament), and Light Years and Soon Forget are quite enjoyable.  Unfortunately, this album does not have much more to offer.<br />I would not by any means say this is Pearl Jam's end, though.  Riot Act, Binaural's successor, was an amazing album, although many disagree.  In the end, its all about which suits your taste the best.
B00005NKKZ|5.0|I almost missed this great album. When it was released I recevied a card I was supposed to return to my record club and I forgot it and received this vinyl album. When I played it, I thought it was the best pop album I'd ever heard and up to this day I still believe that. I've had this on vinyl, 8 track (what's that???), cassette, cd and now remastered cd. <BR>This one has two bonus tracks including a demo version of 'Bridge'. It's almost like an unplugged version because Ernie Freemans' great orchestra is not featured. The lyrics are a little different. Historically it's a good cut but can't begin to compare with the finished version. The only sour note is the live version of 'Bye Bye Love'. Good remastering job and some nice surround effects. A must have for any pop collector.
B0000636UN|4.0|C'mon C'mon is not the emotional powerhouse that was The Globe Sessions, nor quite as brilliant as her self-titled album, but it is still more than pleasant to listen to.  <br />Her capstone song for me is &quot;The Difficult Kind&quot; on The Globe Sessions, a poignant song that is simultaneously warm, haunting, somber, raw, exposed, and bittersweet.  &quot;Riverwide,&quot; another haunting and poetic song, would come second for me as it the anchor - it provides the tone and melody that that whole album drifts along to.  <br />None of the songs on C'mon C'mon quite reach those levels for me, but I have no regrets about purchasing this album.  It's got a sense of fun not as present on The Globe Sessions; its tone is more like the witty self-titled album, but doesn't really explore the depth of emotion to the degree that The Globe Sessions did.  But that's okay; her life and moods are changing, and it's no different than when U2 made &quot;Pop&quot;.  <br />Sheryl Crow is extremely talented and is one of the best rock artists out there right now.  C'mon C'mon is a fine array of her talents as both a singer and songwriter, and there is no reason to disrespect that.
630512762X|3.0|I seen this movie in the theatres and since it came out on DVD and wanted to own some of John Woo's work I was not hesitant in buying a copy of this film since well... his other films are from Hong Kong and Mission Impossible 2 made me fall asleep half way through the film. So I bought this in consideration that this is his best film of his American arrival since it's action packed and since Die Hard no other action movie besides in the War genre has a movie with so much action give you a great amount of atmosphere to see interactions from north ,south, east and west of exploding cars and people getting swiss cheesed!
B00008S2VG|5.0|This body of work is bound to be Madonna's most controversial yet.  Music critics either love it or hate it, and it's unfortunate that those who see it as a lackluster release misinterpret the underlying message of AMERicaN LIFe.  It's littered with her finest music since LAP and ROL.  NOTHING FAILS alone makes owning this compilation worthwhile.  It's the masterpeice that keeps this album cohesive.  Hollywood is bound to ba a summer radio smash, with it's singy songy chorus and infectious hook.  I'm So Stupid is the far superior sister of ROL's Candy Perfume Girl.  Love Profusion seems to be a fan favorite, particularly among my girl buddies in college and it's an infectious, light offering, recalling the light-hearted beautiful stranger off the austin power soundtrack.  Nobody Knows me is yet another Madonna classic.  her voice is warped in this sparse dance song.  Intervention has a hint of Red HOt Chilli Peppers \\"Otherside.\\"  Yet she turns it into a dancefloor opus.  Not a big fan of Xstatic Process, however it's folky feeling somehwat enhances the album's personality.  Mother and Father, anotehr standout, finds Maddy questioning her past and future, however in a less contrived way.  I'm glad Die Another Day is included, as it is a Madonna and Bond classic.  The chorus is unforgettable and it may have changed the bond franchise forever.  Is another Madonna contribution in the works?  I hope so.  The album closes with the brilliant Easy Ride.  We find Maddy in a reflective mood, however never forgetting her roots: the dance floor.  She made the wait worthwhile and I vote AMerican LIfe as the POP ALBUM of the year!
B00008OLYN|5.0|It's Opeth Damit nation! Well you know they kick serious but maybe you don't know the words, hears your chance. Slight electric guitars,drums,bass and beautiful Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals displayed in Steve Wilson's soundstage. Think the best of Alice in Chains and Nirvana Unplugged. Melancholy,sadness,loss,hope and deliverance done with the feeling of Floyd,Genesis(WindandWuthering)and singing with hints of Norwegian Wood tone.The converted I will not preach to but hope to extend the gospel to those who like good intelligent music then make this your first Opeth purchase. For those who like more aggression(Pantera,Tool,Rush) start with,Disclaimer(fasten seatbelt,check rollbar first!)-- \\"Blackwater Park\\". For the people with In Flames,Slayer mindset get \\"Still Life\\" or \\"Deliverance\\". Ok insert cd set amp to 11 press play kill light.
B00004STPT|5.0|I purchased the soundtrack before I ever saw the movie.  I found this soundtrack to be so very moving to my soul.  It has so many emotions interspersed throughout the album.  This album made me become more interested in Hans Zimmer's music.  I find him to be a musical genius.  He knows how to capture a feeling to bring you into a movie that amazes me.  If I may recommend,  listen to his other movie soundtracks.  You may be surprised to find out just how many he has and how awesome he is.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Most people have preconceived notions of this album due to the decision to release \\"Dirrty\\" as the first single. Surely, most of those notions are negative. Stripped is not an album that should be defined by a sexed-up video. It is much more than that. Christina has matured and had her say in what went onto the album this time. She expresses herself very eloquently on most of the album and she is emotionally vulnerable. One should respect the honesty of this album, with the exception of two or three songs that clearly do not belong on the same disc as the others. \\"I'm OK\\" is a stand out track and, in my opinion, the best song on the cd. Overall, a great collection of songs. Now, if only Christina would dress accordingly.
B00003CXS4|5.0|I can watch this film over and over again. Alot the characters are lovable and some you just want to feed to the PIGS! It contains thieves, boxing promoters, pawn shop owners, trailer park trash, bookies, and the mafia all doing their own business when a small object of desire will bring them all together into one fusion of death, fire, and fury! If you like Lock, Stock than you should see this one cause you will like it just as much. About time you can understand what Brad Pitt is saying with the 'Pikey' option so only when he talks on the film a yellow caption in the bottom tells you every single word he is saying except the time when he explains to the boxing promoter what he exactly wants in his new trailer if he wins a big up and coming bet! Good movie!
0688163173|5.0|In the summer of 1954, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island off the coast of Massachusetts.  They are searching for Rachel Solando, a patient who mysteriously vanished out of her locked room.  Stonewalled at every turn, the marshals are frustrated when one of the facilitiy's leaders, Dr. Cawley, refuses to honor their request for patients'and doctors' records.<br />  With the eerie reappearance of the missing Rachel, a violent hurricane ensues. As  Teddy searches for patient Andrew Laeddis, the firebug who started the fire that killed the marshal's wife Dolores, he learns that  no one remembers having seen or heard of this missing sixty-seventh patient.  With a sense of foreboding, Teddy's dreams are expertly woven into his reality as he discovers the nature of the hospital's use of hallucinogenic drugs.  And when his partner goes missing, Teddy is determined to find Chuck and flee the island.  Fearing for his sanity, Teddy begins to suspect that no one can be trusted, and he may never be able to leave the island.<br />  With a nightmarish reality, author Lehane ensconces the reader into the very heart of a mental hospital gone awry, with experimentation on human subjects.  Actual events are intertwined with hallucinations in a fast moving plot that leaves the reader wondering how many patients actually descended into insanity after entering the hospital.  Brilliantly executed, this novel will leave the reader transfixed with its breathless conclusion.
0452282152|4.0|As a professional historian and a fan of Vermeer's paintings, I was hesitent to pick up this book, fearing that I might be unfairly critical. I was relieved to find a beautifully researched and written novel about the subject of one of the 17th century's greatest paintings.  Griet is a sixteen year-old girl forced into becoming a maid for the Vermeer family when her father loses his sight.  This begins a long courtship of sorts between Griet and Jan Vermeer.  I was afraid that the resolution of this tension would \\"paint\\" Vermeer in an overly-speculative negative or positive light.  Instead, the release of this sexual tension is largely symbolic, and occurs in the grinding of pigments or the rape-like piercing of Griet's ear.  Vermeer is left in shadows, which is where he belongs, since the historical record about him is vague.  Chevalier obviously understands the power of his paintings, however, as she is careful to fill her scenes with the everyday objects that Vermeer deified in his work, partly as substitutes for the less acceptable icons of his Catholic faith.  As a result, Vermeer's paintings are rich in domestic detail, as is Chevalier's book.  I found myself frequently looking at the cover art as I read the book, to see if I saw in the face in the painting the same things that Chevalier found. It's all there, in the painting and the book: innocence, loss, desire, sadness.
0802130208|1.0|I chose this book because of it's &quot;humor&quot; and the intrigue of a work by someone who later commit suicide, sick yes but the truth. i didn't enjoy it. The main character really got under my skin and when i'm quick to laugh, i seldom did and was disappointed. Strangely it wasn't the counter-culture themes, the transvestites or the racial issues that bothered me, it really was Ignatius who repelled me at every turn. Maybe that's the point and that makes this a really good book.. maybe, but good book i want to read again, and i almost wish i'd never read this in the first place.
0790729725|5.0|I was very young yet know how to speak english when this movie came out but when I noticed it's present I watched it from front to back and over and over again! IT IS THE BEST MOB MOVIE and you love the characters and the soundtrack to alot of the scenes is absolutely perfect in every way in which they meant it to be for it to sound during those times. There are probably over millions of reviews of this film and I am the last one to be writing one but his is A MUST OWN for any DVD library owner because someone atleast once in your lifetime will ask you about the film Goodfellas! Bravo!
B00008S2VG|2.0|as an avid fan of madonna, i eagerly purchased \\"american life\\".  i was expecting to find the same originality she poured into \\"ray of light\\" and \\"music\\".  while there are a couple good songs (namely \\"hollywood\\") the rest of it is madonna ripping off of the previously named albums...but not for the best. while each of the latter two discs had their own flavor to it, this one had none.  to make matters worse, madonna seems to be regressing in her abilitiy to make innovative lyrics.  in most songs she complains, moans, and complains some more.  in the song \\"nobody knows me\\", she declares that ..well...nobody knows her.  wow. should we feel sorry for her with all her millions and fame? or should we classify her now into the gansta rap category- a.k.a. hard knock life/feel sorry for me even though i get money, cash, hoes everyday.   get back to being original, madonna. ..i still have faith.
B000002N2Z|5.0|deftones are one of the best bands ive heard. i didnt know about them untill around the fur hit, and at that time i didnt really like them that much. My friend had me hear the cd and i was actually impressed. so i then went back to this album and liked it better then around the fur. its heavier, hip-hopier, and damn surely packed with rage. you cant say that the riffs on here are to easy, or to hard; thats not important. whats important is that the riffs fit for a rap core type style. i mean, try adding some solos, and really fast lead parts to adrenaline, wouldnt work ya know.
B000021XS0|5.0|Music fans everywhere, this is THE album.  The greatest album of all time is absolutely \\"Scenes From a Memory.\\"  There are no weak spots; no filler riffs; no lame lyrics; nothing.  Dream Theater flexes its songwriting muscle on this album to create a perfect masterpiece.  If you are in need of an album that will touch you emotionally and blow you away musically, buy this now.  <br />Hail Dream Theater.
B00003CXA3|4.0|Ooooooooh those Frenchie are at it again. You can smell the hairy ladies armpits in this film as a cop notices a huge drug operation happening right under his nose! First time I saw this film was on the History channel since the film is based on true characters and a true story and it was right into the car chasing the subway train. I was locked and never blinked watching this unbelievable chase. I found the title out now I have a copy and I love this movie more. It is a good crime story but I suggest getting the sequel collectors box set which is just two movies if you don't like being put into a state of total inconclusion! The movie is good overall and after all these years even a nunce like me can watch it and enjoy it.
0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane has given another flawless example of why he's at the head of the pack of mystery writers. Set in 1954, two federal marshalls are sent out to Shutter Island which is the home of the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane. A patient by the name of Rachel Solando has escaped and she's considered very dangerous. No sooner do they arrive than a fierce storm ravages the island, stripping it of power and stranding the detectives. What follows is a page a minute jaw dropper as one mystery unravels into another. Ultimately the less you know the better. All I can say is it plays out brilliantly with a guaranteed shock ending you won't see coming. Halfway through I kept saying to myself, 'this would be such a great movie', and then I read the rights have already been snapped up. What I marvel at is how unlike everything else he's already written this is. This feels almost Ira Levinish, or more recently something M. Night Shyamalan would have penned. It's the book that everyone will be talking about, and hopefully not revealing too much.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Say You Will is an album that gets better with each listen.  Like Tusk, it really has grown on me.  I don't think it's left my CD player since I bought it.  There are songs that sound like classic Fleetwood Mac, and then, there are more experimental tracks that keep things interesting.  The album really has a fresh feeling to it.<br />I think my favorites are \\"Thrown Down,\\" \\"Miranda,\\" \\"Say You Will,\\" \\"Running Through the Garden,\\" \\"Steal Your Heart,\\" and \\"Destiny Rules.\\"<br />I guess I miss Christine, but I honestly don't think of her when listening to the album.  And to those people that are being critical of Say You Will, I think it's very safe to say this album is considerably better than most of the music heard on the radio today.
0738206679|5.0|Linked is a very interesting introduction into the emerging science of networks.  The book assumes no previous experience in network sciences so it is easily readable by any one interesting in adding to their personal store of knowledge.<br />I particularly enjoyed the author's writing style.  He presents antiquated ideas as if they are current fact, then moves on in the next chapter explaining the discoveries that make the previous chapters topic outdated.  While definitely not the most efficient way to impart information, it does give the reader a lot of the history behind network sciences.<br />In gene research I see network sciences playing an extremely large part.  There are only a handful of genes that have been found to individually cause and illness, or change someone behavior; instead there has been a complex interaction between multiple genes that produce the final outcome: blonde hair, blue eyes, and a happy demeanor aren't stored in three genes, it is left to the interaction of possibly hundreds of them to come to that simple conclusion.  As the science of network expands and further rules are discovered, I believe this complex interactions will be simplified to some extent.<br />We can see the result of network sciences, whether known to the individuals involved in the planning or not, in the recent conflict in Iraq.  As Linked sets forth, the removal of a significant number of hubs in a network, be it the Internet, economy, or a social structure will render the network inoperable.  This is what the US Armed Forces did with the Iraqi regime: they targeted high ranking officials and key cities both of which are hubs in the network of the regime.  Once a significant number of these &quot;hubs&quot; had been removed, the regime crumbled.<br />I certainly believe network sciences will change the way not only scientists but all individuals approach their work.  Network sciences are applicable in every branch of life where connections between more than one object or person exist.  It is only up to those involved in the networks to determine how they wish to apply it to their life.<br />Considering myself decently versed in Buddhist philosophy, I do find it very interesting that this book sets forth as scientific fact that which Buddhists have been saying for millennia: everything is connected to everything else...ject or person exist.  It is only up to those involved in the networks to determine how they wish to apply it to their life.<br />Considering myself decently versed in Buddhist philosophy, I do find it very interesting that this book sets forth as scientific fact that which Buddhists have been saying for millennia: everything is connected to everything else...
0060974176|4.0|The Machine That Changed the World; The Story of Lean Production <BR>    A great book that although becoming a little outdated portrays the ongoing trends in the automobile production industry in three major cultural areas.  <BR>The three areas are;the Asian lean production (Toyota) v.s. the American system,(mass production) v.s. the European craftsman system.  On a larger scale it will and is affecting manufacturing everywhere.<BR> Henry Ford was the founder of the American mass production system, and Ford was very successful adopting it to the aircraft and steel industries. American companies adopted this system and it is one of the main reasons for American pre-eminence in many industries worldwide.  Toyota has become the founder of the Lean system of manufacturing.   Most of the<BR>early adherents to this system were other large Japanese companies, and responsible for the Japanese manufacturing miracle since the 1960's, as it was adapted from automotive to all manner of industries.<BR>     The book is well written and interesting even though it is based on an MIT study of global trends in the auto industry.   I would like to see an update to this book.  The one anomaly I see is the German Automobile industry.  If Japan and Korea have some of the most efficient auto manufacturing plants in the world and<BR>North America is becoming more competitive, what is happening in Europe comes as no surprise.  Many European automakers have yet to fully embrace American mass production techniques and are now faced with the greater efficiencies of Lean <BR>production.  The book does not explain in my mind the success of the German Auto industry.  It seems to be the one exception to the rule.
0393317552|1.0|The premise of \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" is flawed, as anyone truly familiar with world history will immediately recognize.

B000002MG1|5.0|To give you a better idea of the impact of the music on this album, I'll let you in on a little known fact-  Kurt Cobain, lead singer of Nirvana, listened to this album as he sat on his bed and smoked Kamel Lights, writing his suicide note.  This was the last album he ever heard.
B00008S2VG|5.0|After watching Madonna's special on MTV, I ran out and bought the American Life album.  The critics have been rough on the album, arguing that the latest material is too synthetic, with overuse of the vocoder to cover up her weak vocals.  Ok -- so Madonna does not have the best voice in the world.  But there is something intangible about this album that really hooks you in.  The two singles out so far, American Life and Die Another Day, are both incredibly catchy and have become real great dance hits.  Mother and Father is another great track, with electronics and the vocoder used in a particularly haunting chorus.  I think my favorite song on the album is Nothing Fails.  Fantastic new-style Madonna ballad that builds to climax with the Gospel Choir in the end.  It was such an amazing treat to see this song performed live on MTV, and it's just as wonderful to listen to it over and over again on the CD.
0393316041|5.0|This book recalled me of &quot;Confessions&quot; of Jean Jaques Rousseau. It is a really well written and worth reading. Feynman proves that he is not only a great physicist but also a great &quot;actor&quot;...
B00005JLSE|5.0|the musical is back i a big way.  moulin rouge was excellent, but chicago is pure entertainment.  the music is the best aspect of the movie.  buy the soundtrack and have a good time.  catherine zeta jones is worth watching the movie by itself.  she totally deserved the oscar.  renee is excellent but is overshadowed by catherine.  richard gere is awesome as mr billy flynn.  he should have been nominated at the oscars.  this is the funnest movie ihave seen in a long time.  ive seen it three times in the theater and will probably go again.  i sit in the theater and sing to every song and i kinda dance in my chair.  bravo to rob marshall for making such a wonderful film.  the subject matter is serious but the movie reveals the ridiculous side of the news media and how they are easily controlled.  this movie defines the purpose of hollywood and their purpose for being there.  their job is to entertain, and this movie totally delivers the goods.  go see this movie if you want to have a good time and go see this movie if you want an escape from anything.  the movie is so upbeat that you cant help but enjoy yourself.  i cannot rave enough about this movie and highly recommend it to be seen multiple times.
B00008S2VG|5.0|One of Madonna's best yet.  She again transforms into a new musical being and I will never stop supporting her, best song is Mother and Father! ENJOY
0066214122|5.0|I was a bit unsure of this book when I first got it. It seemed very much like Crichton's early work Jurrasic Park. Was Crichton simply repackaging an old formula in a new wrapper? In truth there are a lot of elements in Prey that are similar to Jurrasic Park as well as his book Sphere towards the end of the book. Technology gone wrong and the suspense that there is something out there wanting to get at the people inside. These elements are present in both books. Don't let that worry you because it doesn't matter. This is a first rate thriller that stands on it's own and will please any Crichton fan.<br />What makes this book much different however from his previous books is it's downright creepy. Creepy like no other Crichton book that I can recall. It's almost as if Crichton had worked with Stephen King. It's almost like a old fashion ghost story but with technology rather than supernatural explinations.<br />Hard to write a review without giving much away and I don't want to spoil anything but needless to say Crichton has shown once again that he's one of the top writers of today.
0140277447|4.0|i think this is a wonderful book. who cares about the pictures? i believe that she made her point accross, and i've been thinking exactly what she has even before i've read this book. she is a terrific writer and THE REASON SHE WROTE TO BOOK is because everyone talks about how horrible the holocaust was. yes it was devastating, but the chinese did their share of suffering as well! maybe even worse, yes that was the japanese in the PAST we know not every japanese is that way. we are not accusing or trying to say that japanese people are only barbaric and nothing more. iris wants everyone to remember this CRUEL history, to prevent it from every happening to ANY COUNTRY again. today is a different day, that was history... but it's good just to be know more about it for a better making in the future.
B00006RU5B|5.0|The absolute best thing to happen to the rock music since Cobain. Sounds so much better than Soundgarden and Rage ever did.

B00005JLEU|5.0|WOW! Hayao Miyazaki is one hell of a director. The only Miyazaki movies I have watched is this & Kiki's Delivery Service (Great movie also) and i am not disapointed with them. This movie is about Chihiro, a young whiny and normal bratty girl who changes very much from the beggining to the end from a bratty girl to a strong young women. When i watch this it feels like it is not even 2 hours but a joy ride i could enjoy over and over. The first time i watched this i could not take my eyes of the screen. Thank you Miyazaki for your beautiful work and i will enjoy this movie forever. I so want to watch the rest of the movies like Castle In The Sky, Princess Mononoke, & My Neighbor Totoro. I cannot wait!!!

With this album they bring back the \\"power ballad\\" style of intensity.<BR>Healing is what I feel from this new release!  Hence the cuts, Awakening, Re-align, Make Me Believe, Straight Out of Line, etc., where the first two albums were screaming out the pain of righteous anger this one brings it full circle as if to say to the offending folks \\"you'll not keep my soul!\\"  The epitome of \\"what doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\\"

0312265859|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy the time spent with Stephanie, Joe, Ranger, Grandma Mazur and the others, but have been very disappointed with the audio tapes.  I truly enjoyed the first two people who read the books for tape but the last 2 books have been far less enjoyable because the woman, while competent, does not convey the \\"Jersey\\" accent or attitude we have come to expect and enjoy.  Please for the next book make the reader as enjoyable as the text and it will be another winner.
B00006CXSS|5.0|The outstanding HBO miniseries \\"Band of Brothers,\\" based on the Steven Ambrose book of the same name, should be required viewing for everyone, due to its unflinching depiction of the realities of war.  But this series is as captivating as it is informative, and even entertaining despite the difficult subject matter.  This is the true story of the Easy Company of the 105th Airborne Division paratroopers, following their combat training, their actual combat on D-Day, at Market-Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and their liberation of a concentration camp and control of Hitler's German mountain refuge.  All of the characters are real, and are mostly played by lesser known actors.  David Schwimmer of \\"Friends\\" does appear in a couple episodes as do \\"Saturday Night Live's\\" Jimmy Fallon (very briefly) and Tom Hanks' son Colin.  Fans of NBC's \\"Boomtown\\" will also recognize four of the actors, especially Donnie Wahlberg and Neal McDonough, who have major roles.  Each episode begins with pertinent moments from interviews with the actual surviving members of Easy Company, though they are not identified so as not to give away which characters survive the war.  It takes a while, but becoming familiar with the many characters and their comaraderie for one another is what makes this series so compelling.  Producers Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks have delivered outstanding filmmaking which will definitely remind you of \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" but improves on that film because of the depth that a miniseries allows.  You will want to watch the DVD extras, especially the 80 minute documentary with the surviving soldiers, so you can see these characters as they are now in real life.  The thirty minute making-of documentary is decent but not extraordinary.  Actor Ron Livingston's \\"video diaries\\" for HBO take you through the ten-day \\"boot camp\\" that the actors went through before shooting, and provides some amusement, but is mainly just HBO promotional material as are the rest of the DVD extras.

Opeth, traditionally a death metal band from sweden, goes a completely different direction with this album. With beautiful melodies and instrumentation, this album has it all. Lead singer and guitarist Mikael Ackerfelt is a genius. In previous albums he has shown the ability to change from death metal screaming to singing with no problem at all. But on this album he leaves the blood and gore at home, and delivers a stunning epic. MUST HAVE THIS ALBUM!!!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|If youre thinking that this is another Tango In The Night album, like 1987's release, then perhaps think again. This album heralds Fleetwood Mac's new album, \\"Say You Will\\" as an album after their Reunion album, \\"The Dance\\" and features a special edition CD album as well as its mass released version. Although there is an apparent absence of keyboard contribution by Christine McVie, this album seems to be able to blend McVie's characteristics from the past. <br />The title track, \\"Say You Will,\\" seems to have a typical McVie undertone and marks a title track that Nicks has written for the first time during her career with the band. However, Christine's absence has brought an earthy feel to this album, similar in sound to Tom Petty (\\"Steal Your Heart Away\\") alongside Stevie's tambourine contribution and BVs by Christine in this particular song. In hindsight, \\"Say You Will\\" makes a good CD to have in your collections, and brings back hints from Buckingham's solo albums' creative content in songs such as \\"Red Rover\\" and the excellent \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave,\\" amongst other greats. \\"Miranda\\" features excellent guitar work again, similar to Buckinghams' excellent live rendition of \\"Big Love\\" on the Dance live album. Stevie's song Silver Girl, brings memories of a style similar to Christine McVie in sound. \\"Destiny Rules\\" by Stevie Nicks has a similar bass to her solo single release song from her album Trouble In Shangri La, \\"Sorcerer\\" as well as feel. So, to every fan that has got this album, there are songs here that everyone can identify with in feel, sound and creativity. It is apparent that certain energies have been created to get messages across from the slightly bewildering \\"Illume (9/11)\\" contribution by Nicks displaying her thoughts surrounding the September 11th tragedy in NY as well as Stevies final thanks to Lindsey and to the band perhaps for their get together in producing this wonderful album.<br />To sum up, this is an excellentalbum from the band and should be in every fan's selections as well as people who have loved Fleetwood Mac at some point in their life. Stevie's farewell song, like a couple of albums before from Fleetwood Mac, ends with \\"Goodbye Baby,\\" similar in style to her version of her song \\"Crystal\\" from the Practical Magic soundtrack album, leaving the listener with warm feelings.
0385504209|4.0|This is a riveting story from the first page, or in my case, the first word. I'm listening to the CD version in my car, and have already missed a few turns down famliar roads. But the reader has the worst faux-French accent I've heard since Peter Sellers, and he assigns it to every French character in the book; male or female. If the story wasn't so compelling I'd have tossed the five disc set out the window (even though it's a rental). The fact that I will hang on  every word is a tribute to Brown, who keeps getting better.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I love Christine McVie and will buy any solo album she releases in the future, but I didn't think of her at all while listening to Say You Will.  There is too much wonderful music to focus on here to spend time thinking about what additional sounds could have been added.  This album is loaded.<br />As far as songs that might need to be skipped over, I only find one out of 18 tracks, and it's that last track.  Every other song grabs attention through either brilliant guitar work from Lindsey Buckingham or the writing/singing of both Buckingham and Stevie Nicks.  There is a lot to listen to in this album, and nearly every moment contained within is there to teach all the little teeny bopper pop stars what real music is all about.  <br />Buckingham's songs do get a bit odd at times, but that doesn't bother me at all.  There's nothing wrong with &quot;odd&quot; if it is quality &quot;odd.&quot;  Lindsey has been creating odd music since 1979, so it should be no surprise at this point.  But his experiments in this album are infused with an incredible guitar style that was lacking in his earlier weirdness (except for perhaps some of his 90's solo album, Out Of The Cradle- which I highly recommend also).  The acoustic guitar work in Say Goodbye alone is worthy of Buckingham's permanent ascension into the pantheon of guitar gods.  Further accolades must also be given for the blistering guitar solos in Running Through The Garden, Come, and Murrow Turning Over In His Grave.  If you miss rock music that takes a moment to kick tuckus every once in a while instead of trying to push over constant guitar noise from beginning to end, this album is a return to what you have been missing for years.  Lindsey has refined both his acoustic and electric playing to a virtuoso level, and he shows it off as often as possible in this album.<br />Stevie's songs are as mystical as ever, and they are as wonderfully performed as ever.  Stevie always seems to perform based on the quality of her company, and there is no better company for her music than Lindsey, Mick Fleetwood, and John McVie.  The lyrics she unleashes in Illume, Running Through The Garden, Thrown Down, and Everybody Finds Out are vintage Stevie Nicks.  Say You Will is a crafty pop tune that catches you with one listen and keeps you singing it for the rest of the day.  <br />The drama is still present in the writing as well.  Both Buckingham and Nicks are STILL writing songs about each other, mentioning both the pain of their breakup and reflections on the times that are still being cherished.  When Stevie sings, &quot;You're not like other people... You do what you want to...&quot; or &quot;You can sit outside his door and wait... Well, you can dedicate your pain to him...&quot; you know she can only be talking about Lindsey.  She has been dedicating her pain to him in song since 1977.  And music fans have benefitted from that pain ever since.<br />This album is a welcome return to quality music in an industry that has been very disappointing for about 6 years now.  There are only a couple of albums in the last decade that compare to the brilliance of Say You Will.  It isn't Rumours II, but no album has ever been or ever will be.  The band has always refused to even try to duplicate the sound of that album, instead always attempting to move forward creatively.  In Say You Will, they succeed totally and perfectly in forging new ground for themselves while still retaining the quality of their classics.<br />If only they wouldn't wait so long between albums...
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack have done it again!  In my opinion, this is their best release to date.  They have perfected their sound, and have improved musically as a whole unit.  The first single off this album, STRAIGHT OUT OF LINE, is a straight up... in your face, solid kick butt rock tune.  I love it!  The whole album shows that the band has matured while still staying true to their own original style and sound.  I would definitely recommend that you buy this album if you are a fan of Godsmack, or kick but rock music.  I grabbed it the day it was released, and I haven't stopped listening to it.
0060935456|5.0|I had never read WD because it seemed to be something I &quot;should read,&quot; and that guarantees I won't do it. A friend who has a house rabbit gave this book to me for my birthday because she thought I was ready to fully enter their world.<br />If you have a house rabbit or are remotely contemplating getting a house rabbit, read this book. (Plus, don't get a rabbit without contacting your local House Rabbit Resource Network!) These are deceptively clever creatures with a strangely simple yet complex way of viewing life. I had no experience with rabbits before I met my friend with the bunnies and have come to understand and honor the lapine world. I helped her care for her ailing Rex until his final days, and I saw every kind of rabbit behavior you could think of. I was even honored by her female rabbit (Hazel!) by being allowed to see the &quot;happy dance,&quot; which defies description, but is an expression of rabbit joy that looks like ariel ballet.<br />The passages where the rabbits forget what has happened in the past five minutes, even though it was harrowing or extremely unusual, is dead on. They are not stupid creatures by any means, but they do not hold memory like cats and dogs. I have seen this very thing and many others, and no one nails it like Richard Adams.<br />Also a gorgeous tale of leadership, loyalty, and trust. The last two pages are simple and beautiful. Hail, Hazel-rah!
B000050IL0|3.0|Geroge Szell having elaborated with Gould, is reported to have said,\\" This nut is a genius!\\"... How come a genius is called a nut, or, a nut a genius by someone who was so akin to a genius? <br />(i) he had a very unique vision on Bach and had played some great polyphonic lines: his fingers, though far less muscular than Horowitz, were very independent-- the result of years of lonely hardwork ( like Richter ) since childhood plus a high degree of concentration. Menuhin put it further and said, \\"He was certainly not as inspiring as Kempff, but he has a divine presence...\\" Needless to say, the Russians were and the Americans are still crazy about him. <br />But Bach by that time was hardly a proper repertoire for either a \\"musician\\" or \\"pianist\\"... Furthermore, like his inspirer Tureck (whom her teacher/colleague Horszowski said, \\"I always take her to be a scholar rather than a musician\\" ), he is by and large a lonely man even in his interpretation-- Nikolayeva did refer to him and her rendition is more a correction of him than anything else (Luganski's interview refers);<br />(ii) the sound of this DVD is not the best by the 80's standard but is certainly more than acceptable but the visual effects are rather poor: he sat very low before the piano on a tiny little stool; he played with the button of one of his cuffs undone with one of his cuffs hanging and waving; the room where the piece was filmed was empty and dull and he looked much older than his actual age.  Fortunately, there are some aerial views showing his fingerworks and those came in the midst of a lot of his face. But the depiction is not as good as The  Alchemist filmed when he was younger-- perhaps that is not the fault of the photographer after all.<br />(iii) he hums a lot in the whole session, something hard to justify. The interview though shorter, is more natural, more engaging and more to the point than The Alchemist. <br />Bewarned that the sort of \\"divine presence\\" as his English Suite which could be seen from The Alchemist is no more: Gould's second version of Goldberg is more down to the earth. Nonetheless, unless one is happy with just one Goldberg, in which case, either Kempff or Nikolayeva may be more preferable, otherwise, one should have the appetide of hearing Gould as well, for he is rare and interesting enough.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack has put out another powerful, amazing, kick in the head rock album once again!  You will recognize the signature Godsmack sound pounding out some new and amazing songs.  Their first single off the album STRAIGHT OUT OF LINE is an amazing tune.  It is very cool, and right in your face... like you would expect from Godsmack.  I would highly recommend that you get this album if you are a fan of Godsmack, or killer rock music.  It is definitely a must have.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This CD is awesome. I Always think its cool when a band blends together music and culture, anf if you feel the same you should check out System of a Down, Ill Nino, Nonpoint, Apex Theory, or the All American Rejects (that last one was a joke).This Cd has one of my favorite songs- Mein Hers Brennt. This is quite possibly the best song ever, or definetely up there with Taproots Fault, Hed P.E.'s Firsty, and Deftones My Own Summer. Check out those bands as well. Back to Mein Hers Brennt. Here's a suggestion: go out on a dark rainy night and walk down alone on a long, poorly lit street listening to this song. Nothing can beat that feeling you'll feel invincible and totally badass. It may sound stupid but just try it. Now that we have gotten past the best track, lets take a look at the other standouts. Links 2 3 4 is also awesome. Ich Will and Sonne are good but they both get repetitive. Feuer Frei is probably my second favorite song. It is featured on the XxX soundtrack. Thought the movie was decent, Rammstein is in it! They play live in the opening scene and light stuff on fire it's worth your ticket or rental price alone! Mutter is good, and eerie. So is The Discs Closer. Zwitter is also one of my faves. It is incredible. The little voice is so funny. Rein Raus is also one of my faves (Making my favorites Mein Hers Brennt, Feuer Frei, Zwitter, and Rein Raus). This blend of aggro crunching guitar riffs and danceable techno beats, this cd would play equally well at a Hardcore Mosh Pit or an Ecstasy Induced Rave. I don't see how it is possible to not like Rammstein. Pick up this, any fans of metal techno hard rock or the German Language! I can't wait for Rammsteins next CD, i hope they keep it to German again, it adds a little something extra. If You like Rammstein check out the afforementioned cultural bands and also Orgy- Candyass, Nine Inch Nails- Pretty Hate Machine, any KMFDM or MDFMK album, Zeromancer, White Zombie, Rob Zombie, Disturbed, Gravity Kills, Deadsy- Commencement, or the almighty Crossbreed's Synthetic Division.
B000089RVX|3.0|Can these guys sound any more like Lacuna Coil? Although the sound of a male and female lead singer IS unique and incredible, Lacuna Coil has been putting out music like that for years. It's amazing how similar the lead singers sound to Lacuna Coil, and the lead singer is trying as hard as she can to look like the lead singer from Lacuna Coil also. Anyone who truly enjoys this type of sound should do themselves a favor and check out the originators of this music...Lacuna Coil.
B000066F6H|2.0|It's nothing THAT great! Sure, the first time you listen to it its highly enegetic and outrageous and you love it, but this CD has no replay value whatsoever. Veni Vidi Vicious? \\"use once and destroy\\" is more suiting, but thats already taken by Superjoint Ritual. Anyway, this CD is decent, but not if you are looking for depth, lyrical prowess, instrumental skill, talent, or anything else. This is a FUN album, which you dont see much anymore. But Thats about it. Main Offender is actually a really good song, but nothing else really stands out. \\"Find yourself another Girl\\" somewhat stands out, because its different, but that doesn't mean its good! However, I do respect the fact that they are making a valiant attempt to revive punk rock in these awful times of self proclaimed punk, orpunk bands like BLink 182, Good Charlotte, and Simple plan, who actually all .... This CD is decent but ultimately not worth buying.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Spirited away is one of the greatest movies ive ever seen it ha a very compelling story of a plain ordinary girl and her family moving when her dad tries to take a shortcut they end up getting turned into pigs because they stole food from this world and the rest you have to watch with great extra features including behind the microphone where it tells and shows you who does the voices.
B00008PW3O|5.0|The cd came....I turned out all the lights and let it play.....&quot;What's the world coming to,&quot; reminds me of MOnday Morning with a beautiful harmony on the chorus. &quot;Murrow Turning Over In HIs Grave,&quot; is just a little bit to wierd...Kind of like &quot;The Ledge&quot; from Tusk. &quot;Illume,&quot; our first listen at Stevie's Contributions is just Poetic. &quot;Thrown Down&quot; has a greay vibe to it and Stevie's voice sounds strong on this track. &quot;Miranda&quot; is ok but not my cup of tea. &quot;Red Rover.&quot; I like this song...very Lindsey with a touch of the Mac. &quot;Say You Will,&quot; is very poppie. I can envision this one on the radio. I especially like the end where you hear a children's choir singing the chorus. &quot;Peacekeeper,&quot; is one of those songs that you can't get out of your mind. Love the harmony between Stevie and Lindsey. &quot;Come,&quot; again not my cup of tea but mabye a couple more listens are needed for this one. The next three songs&quot;Smile at You,&quot; &quot;Running Through The Garden,&quot; and &quot;Silver Girl are classic Stevie tunes and no one could have arranged them better than Lindsey. He is really a Guitar God! NOw I liked The Dance version of &quot;Bleed To Love.&quot; The drums seemed to be to loud for the song and it just didn't have that same vibe. &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; reminds me of &quot;Destiny&quot; from Street Angel. The two closer songs were a perfect way to close the album. I especilly liked the bonus disc. &quot;Not Make Believe&quot; and<BR>&quot;Love Minus Zero/No Limit&quot; were awesome. I would have included them on the disc. They are just too good but I imagine there wasn't enough room and they wanted to keep it a single disc. I do miss Chris but nothing lacks because of her departure. Say You WIll is no suprise. I knew they could make great music....if they just made it! Way to go Fleetwood Mac
B000002MUW|3.0|This isn't bad considering, i liked 'erotica' of her last album but then i bought this i became hooked to the r'n'b beats on human nature and secret. Take a bow is a peaceful number and bedtime stories is average and nothing more. The rest can be boring but this is much more intelligent and grown up.
B000003RCY|5.0|When I first heard this cd i thought it was different from the other rammstein songs of mutter that one is my favorite i suggest that first time rammstein listners listen to du hast or ich will or links 234 those are my favorite ones so i really thought this one was different. and this concludes my review.<br />                                ...
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of Metallica's best CD's.  Their best CD?  I have no idea, because I love them all.  Sure, they changed a little after the black album, but they still kick a**, I don't care what anyone says.  But yeah, this one is great.  My favorite song on it is &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;  &quot;Orion&quot; is also great because of the solo by the one and only Cliff Burton (R.I.P.)  but if you are a Metallica fan, or if you just like Metal, get this CD, because it is great!
B0000039PW|5.0|biggie the poet.the strorytellar this album confirms the argument that i have always held in my mind:tupac was good,but biggie was the best.as an emcee biggie was unrivalled,as a street poet,biggie was as refined as bob marley,as polished as t.s.elliot.many pretenders have tried to usurp his throne but he still remains unassailable.'life after death'is a classic that every hip-hop fan should have.
B000083E79|5.0|Finally!  A greatest hits collection that will please both the new and &quot;hard-core&quot; Cher fan.  You get a little bit from every style of music the lady has recorded.  As we all know, and she doesn't mind telling us, she has been at it for over forty years! If you are &quot;dance fever&quot; there is Believe, Strong Enough, and All or Nothing.  For the rock and roll folks, there is I Found Someone and Turn Back Time.  And yes for the &quot;wise folks&quot; (as opposed to old folks), you get I Got You Babe and All I Really Want To Do.  Along with those mentioned there are many of her other hits that are sure to please.  Additionally, you get great packaging and excellent sound.  What more can one ask for?  Well, since I brought it up, how about the LONG over-due CD release of her 1970's Warner Brother albums?  Any way, this CD is great. so enjoy!
B00005JLR2|1.0|Robert Lewis Stevenson would be turning over in his grave if he knew what they did to his beloved story classic. It's really that bad.<br />Why would they take a time honored literary classic and make it into a hokey sci-fi cartoon? Why? Because that's what Disney does. Disney has done some splendid work on classic tales in the past but on this one, they bombed.<br />It's just downright awful. There's no soul to this story...<br />Move along, there's nothing to see here.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty got a G rating, but this movie does not deserve a G rating. This deserves a PG rating. This movie may frighten young children than to charm them. And this movie is coming out of the vault on video and dvd in America on September 9. This animated movie does not have a lot of familar voices (or at least to me) but a lot of them has gone on to perfrom more voices in Diseny's later movies like The Sword in the Stone, and the Jungle Book. As the movie opens, a baby is born to King Stefan (Taylor Holmoes) and his queen. They name the baby Aurora (Mary Costa). And then at a celbration, three good faries show up with the gifts. Flora (Verna Felton) gives Aurora the gift of beauty, Fauna (Barbara Jo Allen) gives Aurora the gift of song, but before Merryweather (Barbara Luddy) can give her gift, an evil fairy named Maleficent (Eleanor Aldey) shows up uninvited, and to prove she is not upset by not getting invited, she does give Aurora a gift, which is before the sun set on her 16th birthday, Princess Aurora will prick her finger on ths spindle of a spinning wheel and will die. Merryweather changes the speel form death to sleep if this does happen. Princess Aurora was promsied to King Huevert's (Bill Thompson) son Prince Phillip (Bill Shirley). And King Stefan who is afraid for his daughter's life, has all the spinning wheels in the kingdom burned. And then the 3 good faires comes with a plan to become 3 peasents and raise Princess Aurora and protect her from Maleficent, and they change her name to Brair Rose. And for 16 years, Maleficent is so frusted about worrying about where Princess Aurora is hiding for 16 years, and she sends out her pet, to search for her. While the 3 good fairs, are planning a party for Briar Rose.
B00005JL3A|5.0|WOW!  Lewis Carol was never quite like this - but this non-stopride through  videoville {? is it} never lets up from the get go.<br />Lots of heart-numbing special effects [that grisly dog chase for example] - and just what IS that misguided experimental alien creature [lost parts of Alien Resurrection?]<br />All in all it is a damn good ride with lots of eye-candy for both sexes throwing in a few great zombies, a strange little red-toned girl .......  and spectacular sound!<br />Just a GREAT DVD experience - nothing intellectual here - just pure fun!<br />Not forgetting Milla Jovovich [! kind of Courtney Love-like here in the tattered red dress]  ~  and Michelle Rodriguez!
B000008LNS|4.0|If you're like 98% of the people reading this review, you probably weren't even aware this album existed.  That's too bad, because \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" is one of Toto's better efforts.  The band finds redemption on this disc after the disastrous new Jean-Michel Byron material on \\"Past to Present\\".  Unfortunately, \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" is extremely difficult to find.<br />It's important to note that this is not the Toto most casual fans are used to.  This album sounds almost nothing like \\"Toto IV\\", \\"The Seventh One\\", or \\"Mindfields.\\" This disc shows Toto rocking at their hardest, with even the inevitable 'love gone wrong' ballads having a distinct edge.  Think \\"Toto\\" or \\"Isolation\\" with a late eighties or early nineties hard rock sound, or a harder version of \\"Tambu\\", and you're not too far off.  It's not grunge or alternative--the members of Toto are all very capable, highly trained musicians, so this album will never be mistaken for Nirvana or others of that ilk.  Think of it as hard rock performed by people who can really play their instruments.<br />Steve Lukather, in addition to his accustomed role as the band's guitarist, also handles the lead vocals.  And yes, he can sing more than the above-mentioned ballads.  David Paich plays keyboards with his usual skill, though this is primarily a 'drum and guitar' album.  Drums are provided by the late Jeff Porcaro; this is the band's last studio album before his death.  Mike Porcaro plays bass, as he has since \\"Isolation\\".<br />Several of the songs on the album stand out to me.  The experience starts with \\"Gypsy Train\\", a rocker in the `hair band' vein with a Lukather guitar solo reminiscent of Ted Nugent.  \\"Don't Chain My Heart\\" is an infectious, energetic little groove powered by shuffle rhythms provided by the Porcaro brothers.  \\"Never Enough\\" is a scathing criticism of materialistic attitudes, while \\"2 Hearts\\" is a power ballad better than many that sold millions of copies for the band.  \\"Kingdom of Desire\\" is a seven-minute atmosphere piece, for lack of a better term, and is probably the strongest song on the disc.  The collection ends with \\"Jake to the Bone\\", an extended instrumental that may have you thinking of \\"Dave's Gone Skiing\\" from the following album.  The rest of the disc is expertly played as well, even if the songs didn't stand out to me as much.<br />All in all, this is a very solid effort from the band, and exactly what they needed after the Byron experiment went wrong.  It's unfortunate that this album is not readily available, but if you can find it, it's worth having.  And no, you can't have mine.

I LOVE YOU MAX!!
B000068TPN|3.0|The acting is great, the casting (minus Chris Klein) was decent, and the story was interesting. The whole movie is definetly worth watching. Sam Elliott's parts were small, but memorable.<br /><br />There were only two downfalls. The first is the switching of scenes to the women at home, it distracted from the rest of the story. The second is a lot more of a problem. During the climactic battle scene, I have one question. How is it that nobody heard the choppers? Bell helicopter's are very loud. I mean very loud. I'm talking being able to hear it miles away, let alone right on top of them. I realize in some movies, we're supposed to suspend disbelief ... to a point. But I just didn't buy this one. Maybe it's just me.
0694519928|3.0|Maybe this book is only for newly weds, new lovers or desperate people who don't want to lose his or her lover, husband or wife, in those cases could be a good book.<br />Of course the romantic part of the book will be great for ALL the women, is their dream to had a romantic dinner, trip or whatever you like to be romantic, but when you know your partner in bed, you know what he or she likes is very different from each couple to other, in my case none of what is written in that part of the book works, I can't tell that is not true that many persons like that, but not all of them, and I think that nobody will do exactly what the book say in one way or another, you can have some tips to help your relation, but that is all, don't think that if you read the book you will have a happy marriage or anything like that.<br />One important thing that is not written here is that before you go to bed with your wife, girlfriend or lover, shave your face, no matter if is in the morning or at night or if you have to shave twice a day, they will love that.
B00008H2LB|1.0|After listening to both of their albums I concluded that &quot;Linkin Park&quot; are a band in need of some vocal coaching.  Not only is there music unoriginal and unchanging, but also lacks vocal strength from the singer.  Being a musican myself I feel that the vocals are one of the most important elements of a band; therefore, this band only deserves a minimum score of 1 from me! <BR>I do NOT recommend you spend your precious pennies on this album.
0446677450|5.0|It's a great read for all those who would like to increase their assets without sacrificing an arm and a leg.  Kiyosaki presents his ideas with simple examples and an emphasis through charts/pictures.  The charts really simplify things.  Although Kiyosaki makes many of his experiences sound easy, it'll probably take some work and good timing for them to be attainable.  I liked the &quot;two dad&quot; idea.  It presented two opposite views and showed that many things in life can't be taught by a teacher and learned through a book.  At times, the point kiyosaki tries to make can get really repetitive and agressive.  Overall, it's a great book, if you want some advice on how to divide your paycheck better and get out of &quot;the rat race.&quot; FIVE STARS!
B00008S2VG|5.0|...  Here's the truth:  (for those of you out there with a heart, soul, and a brain).  This new album is DIFFERENT than anything Madonna has put out before.  Look at the cover of the album.  Black and white.  Very stark.  Very cold.  Well, that's sort of how the music feels.  It's more personal, reflective, bitter...  But, there a couple of extremely funked out dance tracks.  A couple of beautiful acoustic tracks.  And, overall, I love it.  Every track is a gift from one of the most talented, complex, and underestimated artists living in the world today.  ...Buy the album and judge for yourself.
B000084T18|5.0|yea ery body is on 50 Cent's jock but its all for a good reason. The boy has skills along with the hot beats.

158234082X|4.0|As a former cook in the process of moving back towards it, Bourdain's book was an absoulte delight to read.<br />Though many of the absolute horror stories in his book, are certianly the things he's seen, as apposed to the absolute norm of fine dining, no doubt the things did happen in the late 70's and 80's as Bourdain was coming up and in certain nooks continue to this day.<br />His stories about favorite sauce spoons, pans, side towels, knives, etc touched many fond memories for me, and it had me laughing out loud dozens of times.<br />One of the funniest books I've ever read, though I think working in the business gives you a unique perspective.<br />The book is part information, but mostly, an autobiography of Bourdain's food related life in a blunt, no holds barred way only he can deliver.<br />It's certainly not the most well written book I've ever read, but it's damn enjoyable just like mama's meatloaf.<br />But, if foul language offends you, this is not the book for you.
B00008OLYN|4.0|This album was an incredibly pleasant suprise for me.  In the past I have been somewhat turned off by the growls of the death-metal genre.  It's been frustrating because musically, bands such as Opeth and In Flames, play exactly what I would like to hear:  complex arrangements -- played by extremely talented musicians.  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get past the death-metal growl in most of the songs.<br />While I am not entirely in love with this album, because it is almost entirely acoustic (save for a few clean electric guitar parts, and I do enjoy a mix of heavy and acoustic) I find a whole lot to like about \\"Damnation.\\"  First of all, Åkerfeldt has a truly memorable, and well-controlled voice ( which he knows the limits of and keeps within bounds -- unlike certain atrocious \\"singers\\" in other bands ).  The music and melodies are very catchy -- I keep hearing parts of songs over and over hours after listening to the CD.<br />I love the production quality as well...all instruments are well-balanced.  The percussion has a great raw quality about it that makes the music feel like it's being played in your living room.  In general, think (Pink Floyd) + (The Moody Blues) + (Opeth's mellow sections from previous albums).  If you like Opeth's mellow side, then you MUST buy this album.<br />\\"Addictive\\" would be the best way to describe this album in one word. I'd give it 5 stars but it's missing some metal bite.  4.50 is more like it -- hope this helped.
B00006BXI0|5.0|This is my favorite Symphony X album.  While I love all their other recordings, this one is heavy but still retains the symphonic compositions that I love from all their old albums.  In fact, this album probably has the most diverse selection of songs compared to the others. The lyrics on the majority of the songs are moving as well. <BR>It opens with the dark themed, heavy riff-driven melodic piece, Of Sins and Shadows, followed by Sea of Lies, another moving tune with a technical bass intro.  The Accolade is the ballad for the album and the beginning of a story that is continued on their latest album, The Odyssey.  Pharoah makes you feel as if you are in Egypt.  The backing keyboards bring you a vision of pyramids and dark tombs before breaking into a true heavy metal chorus.  <BR>All the songs are worth the listen, even the 20 minute long title track.  I'm not a fan of very long songs but there are many good points in the song that are worth the wait.  The closing track, Candlelight Fantasia, sees Allen's voice at one of its prettiest moments.  The song has one of Symphony X's most emotionally moving melodies.  If you like Symphony X or progressive music in general, this is an essential album.
B000083E79|5.0|This new collection really does showcase Cher at her best.  \\"Believe\\" is the international #1 smash that catapulted Cher back into the musical spotlight.  I am not familiar with electronica or house music, but I know a great song when I hear it.  The vocal effects and insistent beat work to great effect, and Cher never sounded better.  The power ballad \\"If I Could Turn Back Time\\" is another classic Cher song.  Judging from her recent TV concert, it appears that Cher may have discovered a way to turn back time, since she doesn't look anywhere near her age.  \\"I Found Someone\\" is another great power ballad that, judging from the tabloids, reflects Cher's love life!  Just when the disco era threatens to overwhelm this compilation, the playfully upbeat \\"The Shoop Shoop Song (It's In His Kiss)\\" reminds the listener of an earlier musical era.  That song is immediately followed by \\"All I Really Want To Do,\\" Cher's first solo hit.  Listening to her early vocal style, one can hear the influence of Sonny Bono.  Cher's voice is more mature on the melodramatic \\"Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down).\\"  Three #1 songs follow in rapid succession.  \\"Half-Breed,\\" \\"Gypsies, Tramps & Thieves\\" and \\"Dark Lady\\" helped define Cher as a solo artist and allowed her to emerge from the shadow of Sonny Bono.  This compilation would be painfully incomplete without including Sonny and Cher's two biggest hits, \\"The Beat Goes On\\" and their signature tune, \\"I Got You Babe.\\"  However, this is a Cher collection, and it ends with a remix version of \\"A Different Kind Of Love Song.\\"  Cher wisely acknowledges her past, but also reminds the listener that she has succeeded for several decades as a solo superstar.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|\\"Faceless\\" is the most recent album cranked out by the ever-evolving band Godsmack.  Sully Erna by far has written his best songs for this album.  There isn't one song that is bad.  Each is as good as the previous song.  \\"Faceless\\" also features, Scorpian King hit \\"I Stand Alone\\".  To pick a \\"best\\" song from this disc, is quite difficult.  However, \\"Serenity\\" and \\"Re-Align\\" rank righ up there.  \\"Serenity\\" shows off Erna's heart and soul.  The anger is still there that Godsmack fans have come to expect with the song \\"I F***ing hate you\\" but yet, Sully doesn't have much to be angry about these days.  The band as whole has gelled together and this is one of the tightest sounding disc's from any band that this reviewer has heard in a long time.  Godsmack shows you that even in darkness there is light.  <BR>Buy this disc, you won't regret it.
B00005OAIE|1.0|wow, everyone is raving about John Mayers lyrics, its so funny because they are so shallow ...  Pretty much just a regurgitation of everything else nowadays. It's reminiscent of the Backstreet Boys, with the only problem being that he actually takes himself seriously.  Really, just read the Amazon review, it pretty much says everything.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack's new album faceless is a brilliant addition to their already vicious catalog.  The first single, &quot;Straight out of Line&quot; is a killer song aimed at friends of the band who just dont get it.  This could very possibly be the finest effort yet by the boys from Boston.  With songs like &quot;Make Me Believe&quot;, &quot;Release the Demons&quot;, and &quot;I am&quot;, Godsmack shoves a fistful of metal right down your throat as only they can.  The final track, &quot;Serenity&quot;, lays down a solid groove in fasion with other Godsmack greats like &quot;Vodoo&quot; and &quot;Spiral&quot;.  Basically this is a great new album, and definetly something that any metal head can be proud to hang their head to.  So I suggest going out and picking this one up today
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life deserves a lot more credit than it is given. I, and many otehrs, consider it a much better album than MUSIC and right up there with RAY OF LIGHT and LIKE A PRAYER. This album is darker and has few true dance tunes. Probably the reason why Die Another Day was included. It is by far Madonna's most personal album to date and is done very well. The album has a welcomed accoustic sound; a departure from Maddy's recent works, although it does include some signature Mirwais beats. It's all good. Hollywood, Nothing Fails, Love Profusion, X-static Process, and Intervention sound like single choices. Mother and Father is another stand out and more vintage Madonna. Also, Easy Ride is a great ending; it completes your musical journey \\"full circle\\".

1582432678|1.0|This book made me sick -- it's not for anyone who reads books for redeeming qualities or characters.
B00008973A|5.0|This movie inspired me to be a dancer.  It is one of the greatest movies I have ever watched.
B00008S2VF|5.0|This is by far my favourite Madonna album to date. It's outstanding and it proves to me why I love her music so much. She's an excellent writer, performer, and collaborator. <br />Here is my review:<br />American Life - well you've probably heard this on the radio. I like it, a funky song kind of like <BR>Music <br />Hollywood - has an 80's feel. Changes from dance to more mellow and back to dance again. <br />I'm so Stupid - I really don't like this song. It's the most stupid record she's ever done. I can't <BR>even bear to listen to it anymore. This is the only track I skip. <br />Love Profusion - Mellow Pop - very catchy and it's grown on me a lot. <br />Nobody Knows Me - This is classic Madonna and one of my favourites. Great chorus - great <BR>pop and dance but with a serious message. <br />Nothing Fails - This is another song that grows on you. I won't spoil the best part but lets just <BR>say it's reminiscent of Like a Prayer. This is the reason Madonna is better than all the other <BR>... She's not afraid to be different, she always has something profound to say yet <BR>she keeps us interested. ...<br />Intervention - This is a love song - mellow. I like it but I'm so in love with some of the others I <BR>haven't given it a proper chance yet. <br />X-Static Process - On MTV Madonna seemed to be saying this was a religious song. Her <BR>asking questions of God, and expressing her beliefs at the same time. Again it's ok but a little <BR>too mellow for me. <br />Mother and Father - Great dance! I love this one and I'm sad to say I cried the 1st time I heard <BR>it. Very serious song about her relationship with her parents but because the song is high <BR>dance it's unique and different. Her voice was perfect and the words so touching I couldn't <BR>help but cry! (Yeah I know I'm insane but I've loved Madonna's music since I was 13 and I'm <BR>now 30) <br />Die Another Day - Like Music - great catchy song <br />Easy Ride - This is an interesting song and at first I didn't take much notice of it but when I <BR>listened to it all the way to the end I really enjoyed it. Mellow with dance beats and funk <BR>added and a great orchestral sound similar to frozen. <br />So my favourites are Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, and Mother and Father. <br />Die hard Madonna fans will probably agree with my sentiments that this is her best album to <BR>date but maybe some others may disagree with me!<br />Please buy this album and see for yourself. I welcome other people's reviews.
B000002E5J|2.0|Shakira tiene mucho talento, pero a mi parecer se ha vuelto muy comercial, creo que puede crecer mas como cantautora si se lo propone.
B000000WA4|5.0|To be honest I hadn't heard a single Smashing Pumpkins song until I bought this album a couple of years ago. I was a musically naive person who listened to whatever was on the radio. So when I first listened to this CD it was from a completely unbiased point of view. By the third song I was amazed at the uniqueness and lyrical genius of the songs. Needless to say I now own every Smashing Pumpkins CD and more. I was amazed by the unique and broad musical range of these songs, and pleasantly surprised by the emotional lyrics. Every song seemed to relate to me exactly. Some lyrics moved me almost to tears. The songs don't always have that same connection to me anymore but they're still great to listen to, and this CD remains my favorite from the Pumpkins (which says alot). If you want an incredibly diverse and emotional album, this is the one for you. The songs are so good you don't even notice Billy's voice ;)
B0000019PA|5.0|ever since the crashes of Value Jet and Flight 800 (8 years ago?) i have had a dissipating yet intense fear of flying. when the flight attendants are droning on about floatation devices (yeah, that will help) and vacu-packed peanuts, i put a certain neutral milk hotel song on and listen to it until it's baggage claim time. because if we go down and it's the last thing i ever hear, then that would be okay and i wouldn't be afraid. the song is actually on their debut, On Avery Island, but Aeroplane is the record that encompasses for whatever reason what that song suggests to me ... the sum of everything i have ever known or wondered, ever hoped for or regretted, everything i have ever loved and lost. it's not for everyone, but most things of true personal revelation are too intimate and difficult and strange to ever be.
B00005UKKF|5.0|I have seen Britney's show live a couple of times in 2001 and 2002 and I am for the whole big production thing, I enjoyed the show.  This DVD is a great keepsake, a wonderful way to watch it any time I want to.  So I would say get it, it's worth the money.
B00005JKCH|3.0|I have never been a fan of comic books so I guess I was at a disadvantage when I watched this.  From what I have seen of Spiderman comis this does do a good job staying true to the spirit of the comics.<br />So many movies today rely too heavily on special effects. This is definately one of those.  Plot exposition and character development come second to displaying great, though overused CGI graphics.<br />The CGI spiderman jumps from building to building with reckless disregard for any sence of physics of laws of gravity.  It looks too fake.  You know he's a superhero, but still it looks too cartoonish.<br />Kirsten Dunst looks great as Mary Jane and Tobey Maguire does a great job as Peter Parker.<br />If you are a fan of comics and comics turned movies this is a must see, otherwise it probably won't be worth seeing.
B000059HB7|5.0|Howard Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is a film so simple in appearance and execution that contemporary critics tended to brush it off as just another 'John Wayne Western', a charge they also leveled against John Ford's 'The Searchers'. In both cases, the critics misjudged films that captured the directors' talents at the apex of their careers. Certainly, no film could better be defined as 'A Howard Hawks Film' than this magnificent western!<br />While Hawks worked in a wide variety of genres, the core of his films most often revolved around the camaraderie of friends to fulfill difficult, if not impossible tasks. This sense of loyalty and devotion made him the 'father' of what we call, today, 'buddy pictures'. The idea that a man might be deserted by those closest to him at a time of need was unconceivable, which prompted him to speak out against 'High Noon', with it's 'Man Alone' theme. His attitude was shared by John Wayne, who once called 'High Noon' the worst film his friend, Gary Cooper, ever made! Together, the pair decided to create a film that would tell a similar story on THEIR terms; the hero, here, hasn't a shortage of allies, but too MANY who are willing to risk their lives!<br />In putting together 'Rio Bravo', Hawks reunited 'Red River' stars Wayne and Walter Brennan, and composer Dimitri Tiomkin (Legend has it that Hawks and writer Leigh Brackett originally wrote the part of drunken deputy Dude with Montgomery Clift, from 'Red River', in mind; unfortunately, Clift, whose life and career had crumbled following his near-fatal car accident, was unavailable, and Dean Martin stepped in, giving one of the finest performances of his career). Beautiful, tough, feisty females were always a staple of Hawks' films, and Angie Dickinson continued the tradition, verbally challenging Wayne repeatedly, until he finally acknowledged, by film's end, that he loved her (in a most unexpected way!) Rounding out the cast were veteran actor Ward Bond, as the 'Sacrificial Lamb', another Hawks' staple, and TV and musical star Ricky Nelson, complete with a 50's Pompadour hairdo and an acting style that could most kindly be called 'wooden', as a young stud gunslinger, to attract teenagers to the film. (It is said that Elvis Presley was the first choice for the role, but his manager, Col. Tom Parker, nixed it; what a casting coup THAT would have been!)<br />As with all of Hawks' best work, relationships are given equal status with the plot, and each character has ample opportunity to shine in his role, while bonding with the others. A film highlight is a cozy scene in the jailhouse, where, as Wayne smiles on approvingly, Martin and Nelson warble a couple of tunes, with 'Stumpy' Brennan accompanying them on a harmonica. In the hands of a lesser director, scenes like this would seem an unnecessary distraction from the story; in Hawks' skilled hands, we hate to see the scene end!<br />There is so much to like about this film that whole essays have been devoted to it, and it's importance, not only as quintessential Howard Hawks, but as one of the finest westerns ever made. Hawks, himself, was so pleased with the results that he 'remade' the 'Rio Bravo' story twice more, with Wayne; first, as 'El Dorado' (with Robert Mitchum taking the Martin role), then as 'Rio Lobo'.<br />If you want to see one of the screen's greatest stars and a legendary director at 'the top of their game', or you'd just like to kick back with a classic western, complete with rip-roaring action, comedy, romance, and even a bit of toe-tapping music tossed in, look no further...'Rio Bravo' is for you!Hawks' staple, and TV and musical star Ricky Nelson, complete with a 50's Pompadour hairdo and an acting style that could most kindly be called 'wooden', as a young stud gunslinger, to attract teenagers to the film.

B00008J4P5|4.0|I was introduced to The Whitestripes after seeing them on SNL several months ago.  I was attracted to their songwriting, powerful gutair, and true rock feel.<br />This album is no different. Building on the strengths of White Blood Cells this album will surely please Whitestripes fans as well as people just discovering them.<br />The first track, &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; with its strong bass line and driving march like beat is a great opening to this album that sounds &quot;British&quot;.<br />All in all this is a stronger, more refined album than previous albums. This album snows their growth as a band, meg's growth as a rock drummer, as well as Jack's growth as a songwriter.
0385335482|3.0|If you want a quick &quot;beach&quot; read to keep you busy, this book has a bit of humor and entertainment for just that. But the character is just way too annoying, stupid, and ignorant for me to get that attached (even though I, myself, am a total shopaholic). I definitely recommend &quot;Good in Bed&quot; by Weiner instead if you want something quick, funny and with some real value. I won't be reading the other two in the trilogy.
B00008DDXC|4.0|The movie is great.  Very true to the 2nd book.  Since this book was slightly longer than the first, some parts had to be cut from the movie.  These cuts were actually filmed as \\"additional scenes\\", and are included on the second bonus disk.<br />The image and sound quality is very good especially since a lot of the movie is shot in darker lit areas.  The special effects which looked lower budget in the first movie actually shine in this film.  The scenes of Quidditch will be right up there from action scenes from great sports movies.  You will feel right there among the players.<br />The bonus disk in this DVD set is better than in the first movie.  Its much easier to navigate and the menus are more alive and animated.<br />Overall a great movie adaptation of a fun book. This DVD will be sure to please fans of the movie and of the book.
6305014140|3.0|the movie is decent, but there seems to be too much gore and nudity which is superfluous, adding nothing to the plot. also leaves a lot of loose ends, not the cool kinds that make you think (like NGE and Serial Experiments Lain) but ones that make it look like the creators didnt wanna spend the full amount of time needed to make a classic. the end is pretty stupid, from jubei and kagero \\"making love\\" by just kissing (while the beginning goes ahead to show fondling and doggy style with complete sound effects; not saying they should have gone that far w/ jubei and kagero, but it just shows how dumb the other scenes are) and the stupid water-kills-evil ending which is equally horrible as in mel gibson's \\"signs.\\" there is so much good anime out there these days, and i would only recommend this if youve already seen all the rest.
B000002IGQ|4.0|I have to say I love this album. Everything about this album is great. Everybody knows the songs &quot;Round and Round&quot; and &quot;Back for More&quot;, they should anyway. Well, that's why I got this album. I was surprised by the fact that every song on here was good, some better than others. &quot;You're In Trouble,&quot; &quot;She Wants Money,&quot; and &quot;Lack of Communication&quot; are the best examples. If you like heavy guitars, heavy vocals, and big hair this is for you. Sure beats the Alternative.
1587990717|1.0|I have never written a book review before, but I feel obligated to dispell the ideal that this book has even one redeeming quality.  This is by far the worst book I have picked up in years.  It was so bad that I couldn't waste my time finishing it.  After 60+ pages I realized the author had nothing interesting or unique to say--I skimmed the rest and found no value to continuing.  I can certainly agree with his premise: indeed there are many random events in the world and we often look for correlation or causation where there is none.  However, the author spends his time developing storylines that have no basis in reality nor support his thesis while promising to get to the real meat in later chapters.  As for building a solid and interesting framework on mathematics?  Forget it.  100 pages into the book and the big revelation he provides is there is a difference between mean and median due to skewness in data?  Big revelation!.  Please tell me something else I learned in statistics 101. <BR>This author should be named Narcisist, not Nassim.  The rest of the book is devoted to propping himself up in his own version of an occupational caste system, where he is on some higher plain because he fancies himself to be some sort of quant jock who knows basic statistics and probabilities. In the meantime, he manages to insult MBAs, academics, specific authors, people who live provident lifestyles, successful but &quot;non-quant&quot; traders, scientists (those with poor social and hygene skills), dentists, and on and on.  Pompus, self-serving, and hollow.<BR>Please read Against the Gods by Peter Bernstein.  It is excellent, engrossing, compelling, well written, with wonderful mathematically-sound examples.  The only thing I can say bad about Bernstein is that, to my dismay, he endorsed this book.
B000002UEA|3.0|I got this album a while ago and just recently I've been listening to it a lot more. I like it but it seems that they are stuck in the light pop mode, which I think is what they are known for anyway. On songs like &quot;Love on the Rocks&quot; they have some sweet guitar work but they never really emphasize on it. Other songs like &quot;Back to the Rocking Horse&quot; and &quot;Bad to be Good&quot; are the same way, but are still good. Some songs don't seem put together well but somehow it strangely works, parts of &quot;Love on the Rocks&quot; imparticularly. <br />I like the album but no telling how much better this would have been if they would have put more power into it. Think of it as Kix light.
0385504209|1.0|Practically unreadable, this overhyped chuckleworthy book seems to parody the genre. Every paragraph is packed with cliches, and every aspect of the novel, from characterization to plot to language, has a wide silly streak. Read aloud to provoke a giggle fit.<br />The above may sound mean-spirited, and is partially a reaction to the disconnect between the quality of this book and avid, glowing reviews from Salon and the New York Times (both by film critics; what's up with that? Do film critics not normally read?).<br />If this sentence from an early chapter sounds \\"gleefully erudite\\" (jesus h, Janet Maslin!) to you, you'll probably love the Da Vinci Code:<br />\\"One mile away, the hulking albino named Silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious brownstone residence on Rue la Bruyere.\\"<br />Hulking, limping albinos! Always an excellent choice when selecting an assassin.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life explores themes of love and enlightenment through creative, innovative, and sometimes artfully-abrasive music that sounds utterly unlike anything in pop.  Lyrically, the album explores Madonnas understanding of love as constituted through relations with othersas opposed to the narcissistic self-love of celebrity adulation.  Love grants wisdom, but also a certain sadness, because love is always haunted by loss (the death of a mother, for example).  Love also constitutes a kind of spirituality, and this album finds Madonna continuing her spiritual quest, moving beyond religion in deliberately contradictory lyrics:  Im not religious, but I feel so moved, makes me wanna pray she sings on the devastatingly beautiful Nothing Fails.  Musically, the album cites Madonnas past, just as it does lyrically, with references to Like a Prayer, Ray of Light, even Papa Dont Preach occasionally popping up.  The production values are impeccable, and even though the songs are often a mélange of complex computer effects, they never seem impersonal.  Madonnas voice is lovely, as she masters a variety of singing styles (including an homage to Kate Bush on Mother and Father).  And the dance songs rock, especially Nobody Knows Me, which includes a killer breakdown (Madonna singing/shouting I dont watch TV!) that will get you on your feet.  Dont be put off by the aggressive imagery of the cover and videos:  this is an extremely personal album that far surpasses Music and Ray of Light.  There is not a bad song on it.  This album just might bring tears of joy tempered by wisdom to your eyesit did to mine, honestly.
0316666343|1.0|This novel had so much more potential for creativity and spiritualism. Instead, the characters were poorly developed, the omnipotent viewpoint wasted. What could have been a suspenseful murder mystery and tale of healing left me feeling totally empty.<br />The ending was completely unsatisfying and bizarre, too--almost like an editor recommended a rewrite, and the result was two separate stories glommed onto one another.<br />I must have missed something, but the critics' hype for \\"The Lovely Bones\\" seemed totally off the mark.
0060012218|5.0|What a wonderful book! It's a vivid, endearing, and human portrayal of teenage struggle, discovery, and ambition for truth, authenticity and friendship. A beautiful story not only of a personal journey but also of how society can evolve to become more appreciative of diversity and friendship. Protagonist Russel Middelbrook is sure to become an important part of the memories of many young readers, though this book is also wonderful reading for adults.  Yes, do buy this book.
1582432678|5.0|I cadged an advance reader's copy of this novel and read it in two sittings.  It's terrific--a tour de force that constitutes, to my knowledge, the first full literary treatment of the American teenage mass-murder phenomenon that culminated in the Columbine massacre in 1999.  Shriver's effort will be difficult to surpass.  As with a Columbo mystery, the reader is made aware of the central violent act from the outset.  The intrigue, drive and substance of the novel reside in the how and why.  The plot unfolds in a series of letters from the culprit's mother, Eva Khatchadourian, to her estranged husband Franklin, yet the book has none of the shortcomings--remoteness, dearth of dialogue and characters, lack of \\"granularity\\"--that tend to afflict epistolary novels.  The letter format simply allows the narrator to focus her agonized reflections about what she may have done wrong as a parent directly onto her main accomplice in child-rearing.  That question does not admit of a clean answer, and Shriver does not indulge in writing a ruminating novel-of-ideas on the artificially stark nature/nurture question.  This book is about particular people rather than archetypes, and the way their irreducible peculiarities--Eva's sardonic remove from both family and country, Franklin's infuriating guilelessness, Kevin's willful intelligence and perhaps an inborn kernel of evil--combine with a society that is alternately too pitiless and too forgiving to produce a terrible outcome that is hell to predict.  The excellence of the novel derives from the author's refusal to burden the reader with vacuous homilies or \\"lessons,\\" from her illumination of the possibility of reason in apparent randomness, and from her pervasive conviction that even the horrid has the virtue of poignancy.  Kevin is a dark and unsettling fellow, and We Need to Talk About Kevin is a dark and unsettling book.  Yet it rewards the reader with one of the most hard-earned--and soberly redemptive--endings I've yet encountered in fiction.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I didn't even have to listen to this entire album 2 or three times for me to appreciate it - it just got down to business in the first listening.<BR> <BR>If you liked &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; but were yearning for a bit more leaning on the guitar, then you won't be disappointed.  Hard charging guitar (see Jimmy Page) and strong drums on such rockers as 'Ball and Bicuit', 'The Hardest Button to Button'  and 'Girl You have No Faith in Medicine' are mixed superbly with Meg's contrasting solo's and simple melodies in 'In the Cold Cold Night'.  <br />Of course, right out of the gate 'Seven Nation Army' sets the pace for the entire album.<BR> <BR>Well Done.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|I love this album!  I love Godsmack!  I jsut don't know why people have to be hating?  Why do they associate anger with Godsmack?  Sully writes what he is feeling and he isn't always angry!  I love the diversity of Godsmack....how they can be different and not always the same!  I recomend this album to all fans of music!
B00003CXFV|4.0|Thiis was a good movie with solid performances.I'm not a big Julia Roberts fan butshe did a great job. The story and pacing were great. Some of the facts were embellished (but that's Hollywood!
B00008S2VG|3.0|I'd have given this 3 1/2 stars if I could.  This disc is an extension of the direction Madonna had on Music - hard electronic beats with cold, clear vocals on most songs, softer and more personal guitar on the rest.  After a few listens I discovered there is more depth to the songs than is apparent at first.  The lyrics are personal - almost all in the first person about her own life and experiences - but not as revelatory or warm as on Ray of Light.  And the electronica is not as fresh or bright as on Music - I fault the production for that.  The same sounds pop up in many of the songs, giving the album a needless level of sameness.  While the songs themselves are quite good - look for quite a few hit singles - the production holds them back a bit.  I'm looking forward to remixes that bring out more of the melody and warmth that is kind of buried on the album.  Overall, a very good Madonna album, but Ray of Light, Music and Erotica are better.
B00005JLEU|4.0|I liked it,being a fan of animation.The story was good but it wasn't great. A intertaining FAMILY movie.
0151008116|4.0|C.S. Lewis meets Dean Koontz.  Our 16 year old hero is the son on an Indian zoo owner and is intent on his search for enlightenment.  When the father decides to sell the animals and move his family to Canada the story is set in motion.  The Japanese cargo ship upon which they travel sinks!  Young Pi spends the better part of a year aboard a lifeboat, sharing his meger proisions with a hyena, an orantang and a Bengal tiger to name a few of his boatmates.  His life is emeshed in pure horror as we follow his day to day activities of avoiding the sharks that surround him and the wild animals that share his small space.  The constant quest for water and food to feed himself and keep the tiger at bay add to the daily misery he must endure.  We have storms at sea and an enchanted island to wrap ourselves around while we turn the pages of this captivating book.  One cannot give away an ending but it's fair to say that the book is not over until the reader closes the cover and and dashes to the kitchen to float a piece of fruit in the sink.
B000089RVX|5.0|That's a bold statement to make in April but my time and space has been rocked by FALLEN.<br />I heard the first single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on a radio station in L.A. where the DJs were dissing the band (KROQ to be exact--good station but worthless DJs).  I was confounded by the snarky comments about the song because it was one of the most brilliant songs I had heard in LONG time.  I needed to hear more from this band as result of &quot;BMTL,&quot; so I sampled a few tracks.   By the time I got to the fifth track &quot;Haunted&quot; I was sold.<br />This band has a revolutionary sound.  FALLEN follows a thematic path that adds cohesion while avoiding repetition. They seem to take the best parts of different musical styles and mesh them together into a cohesive and powerful sound.  Harsh yet beautiful, raw yet ethereal--who knew it was possible and from a bunch of 20 year olds?  It usually takes some years to accomplish what Ben Moody and Amy Lee have with this album.<br />And let's talk about that Amy Lee.  What a voice.  She's a star.  Her voice is able to rock yet still maintain it's feminine beauty--amazing.  Once again they balance her outstanding vocals with the music so that one doesn't overpower the other.  Some have said the guitarwork is too simple.  I say it's all about proportion--if they were to implement more complex guitarwork some other element of the music might suffer and be upstaged.  These are savvy musicians who know how to balance their music and never let it go into overproduction.<br />This album is just addictive.  They are like no other--especially not Linkin Park who lazy people compare them to.  Nothing against Linkin Park but Evanescence has their own thing going on.  If they were sooo much like Linkin Park it would seem that I would like Linkin Park's music too, but the truth is I only like one song by them and it's a song that is not  even characteristic of LP's sound. Just because they have a GUEST rap vocal on ONE song does not a Linkin Park clone make.<br />I've never written a review before because I haven't been passionate enough about anyone as I am about Evanescence.  If you buy one cd this year make it FALLEN.
B00008J2DQ|4.0|Godsmack's third album \\"Faceless\\" is the bands most well rounded release from the Boston area quartet.  New drummer Shannon Larkin really shines on this one.  The album is angry and yet positive at the same time.  Singer Sully Erna truly relases his deamons on the album.  No longer does the \\"poor me\\" come into play here.  This one is all about moving on for the best.  An execellent CD for old fans and new ones.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is great! and many people agree with me, Just Buy it. The bad thing? There are?<br />My favorites....<BR>- Mother and Father<BR>- American Life<BR>- Nothing Fails<BR>- Hollywood<BR>- Nobody Knows Me<BR>- Easy Ride<BR>- I'm So Stupid
B00008PW3Q|3.0|I am a LONG-TIME FM fan and absolutely adore Stevie, so I am not pulling a Micheal Moore...<BR>The first time I heard the CD, I really did not like it at all. I was very disappointed, and the only song that stood out was Good-Bye Baby by Stevie at the end.<BR>However, I listened to it again today and admit some songs are growing on me alot (Miranda, Running through the GArden, Silver Girl, Bleed to Love her). I was disappointed with Ilume. Stevie's voice is SOO DEEP on this one.<BR>I hope the concert contains more older than newer.
0800177177|1.0|Horrible. This is the worst version of Bram Stoker's classic. Hell, even Mel Brook's movie is more acurate! Mina in love with Dracula? He's a monster, not a womanizer. What was that tiger part? Probaly the worst film of everyone involved. And finally, why does Dracula turn into a Sasquatch?
B00003CXI1|1.0|OK, so the story goes like this:<br />  There is this boy, who is an orphan, his parents were both killed by the dark one. He lives with his uncle and aunt. He hides a power within him, that he is unaware, of but he feels that he is made for greater things. His uncle and aunt know about it, and if not acting against it, they keep quiet about it.<BR>  <BR>  Then one day, a strange messenger appears starting a series of events that eventually lead the boy away from his foster home, have him join a bearded wizard/mentor that teaches him all about his power, he begins a friendship with another boy and a girl, and all three of them, with the wizard's advice, take off for a series of mind-blowing adventures that ultimately lead to the destruction of the dark one, the killer of the boy's parents.<br />  The Question. What is the boy's name?<br />  If you answered Harry Potter, you're soooo wrong! <BR>  The boy's name is LUKE SKYWALKER. The wizard is Obi-Wan Kenobi. The friends are Han (Not Ron) and Leia.<br />  It as apparently the most outrageous theft of an original idea that has ever happened in the movie business. Outrageous because it had such a wide acceptance by the audience and no one to see right through it. <BR>  Technology had already advanced tremendously since star wars so the effects job gave &quot;Harry Potter&quot; a more exotic look. But!! not being able to come up with an original idea, they borrowed from a newer Star Wars some elements. the silly broomstick/basketball game is clearly an altered Pod Racing, and is used in &quot;Harry Potter&quot; almost at the same point in the duration of the movie as pod racing in &quot;Episode I&quot;<BR>  <BR>  My problem is mrs. Rowling, who obviously, when had this &quot;amazing idea that eventually changed her life&quot;, was watching Star Wars: A New Hope, on video...<br />  Do yourselves a favor. When in the dillema &quot;Magic or Force?&quot;, choose the Force. <BR>  Go see STAR WARS instead. Such a better movie.<br />  To be continued... ( I'm pretty sure not all of Star Wars qualities were used in this one.)
B00008H2LB|5.0|I had been wanting this CD for a long time.  Then I got tired of wanting it so I totally forgot about it when it was released.  The next thing I knew was seeing the CD and remembering about it.  So I bought it.  This CD is awesome.  After Hybrid Theory I thought Linkin Park would fail with their career because it was such a great CD and you can't top that.  When Reanimation was released, I thought Linkin Park had failed.  But they came out with Meteora and it is great...<br />Foreward-It's not even a song its just a beat skip it 0/10<br />Don't Stay-Chester is great 9/10<br />Somewhere I Belong-Mike is awesome in this song, but this song is just overplayed on MTV and radios 9/10<br />Lying From You-Chester does great with his &quot;screaming&quot; and Mike does good rapping but not the best 8/10<br />Hit the Floor-This song wasn't good at the very beginning but I kept on listening to it and its great now 9.5/10<br />Easier to Run-It's &quot;ok&quot; 8/10<br />Faint-AWESOME!10/10<br />Figure.09-This chorus will get stuck in your head for the longest time 10/10<br />Breaking the Habit-soft song but not catchy 7/10<br />From the Inside-Brad does great and Mike is good too 8.5/10<br />Nobody's Listening-Another song that will get stuck in your head 10/10<br />Session-Cure for the Itch is better 6.5/10<br />Numb-sounds like &quot;Pushing Me Away&quot; but also good 9.5/10<br />Overall this is a great album and a Solid Outcome from Linkin Park
B00008S2VG|4.0|Love her or hate her, Madonna is the definitive pop music icon of the past 20 years.  No modern artist has managed to maintain our fascination and stay strong at the top of the charts as long as Madonna.  Constantly evolving and reinventing herself Madonna has taken us along on her wild ride of self discovery and growth.  From the sugar rush of \\"Like A Virgin\\" and \\"Holiday\\", the dance high of \\"Into the Groove\\" and \\"Vogue\\", the provocative \\"Justify My Love\\" and \\"Erotica\\" to the searching \\"Frozen\\" and celebratory \\"Music\\" Madonna continues to show new colors and get better and better as an artist.  After releasing the lush and meditative \\"Ray of Light\\" and the sonic candy \\"Music,\\" Madonna gives us the spare and introspective \\"American Life\\".<br />This is Madonna's bittersweet symphony.  Unlike the cocoon of the \\"Ray of Light\\" album and the soulful urgency of the \\"Like A Prayer\\" record, this is an album that slowly seeps in before it really takes hold.  At first listen the folk/ electronic blend of the first single American Life didn't seem to fit.  Keep listening and you're rewarded with a layered and intelligent song that questions America's obsession and distraction with the superficial and trivial life.  A great intro into an album where Madonna lays it bare and asks \\"What's left when the fruits of fame and success have lost their taste?\\"  <br />Collaborating only with French techno pop provacateur Mirwais, this is Madonna's most cohesive record.  \\"Hollywood\\" is a funky synth-folk jam that's great when cranked up on the car stereo, windows open on a sunny day.  The sinewy \\"I'm So Stupid\\" is Madonna's wry and witty look back at her old self.  \\"Love Profusion\\" is hypnotic with it's simple guitar and quietly propulsive beat.  \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" takes off in the same direction as \\"Music's\\" \\"Impressive Instant.\\"  It's a twisty, stuttering fun house of a song.  The two masterpieces of the album are the soaring \\"Nothing Fails\\" and the gorgeous \\"Intervention.\\"  With \\"NothingFails\\" Madonna tips her hat to earlier hit \\"Like A Prayer.\\"  \\"Nothing Fails\\" starts off in a hymnlike hush and keeps building and building to a spine tingling finish where Madonna is backed by a gospel choir.  Simply stunning.  The fuzzy guitars coupled with Madonna's sweet and earnest vocals make \\"Intervention\\" a true gem.  The stripped down \\"X-Static Process\\" is like a lullaby, pure and bare.  Another album highlight is the make you want to dance confessional \\"Mother And Father.\\"  Madonna closes the album with the languid \\"Easy Ride\\" where she takes the album's themes of self-confession, honesty, and social dissatisfaction full circle and finds her inner footing.  The only misstep on the album is the throaway Bond theme \\"Die Another Day.\\"  While a fun and mindless single on it's own, \\"Die Another Day\\" is out of place on this collection of bittersweet and introspective songs.  <br />Overall I rate this record an A minus.  It's one of Madonna's best.  A lot of press on this album has been mixed.  People don't know what to make of it.  It's not the album that the public expected of Madonna.  It's a quiet and spare album from an artist who is best known for smoke and mirrors, masks and costumes, sparks and high energy combustion.  With \\"American Life\\" Madonna gives us an about face and provokes by asking us to go deeper and discover what really matters when all artifice is pushed aside.  The artistic triumph of \\"American Life\\" shows that Madonna is still a force to be reckoned with, still at the top of her game and won't be going away for a long time.  I can't wait to see what she comes up with next.

0920668372|5.0|I bought this book about 2 years ago and just recently I pulled it out of the bookshelf and read it to my sons.  They are 4 and 3 years old.  As I read the book, I found myself crying.  It was so touching and beautiful. They asked why I was crying and I explained how the mommy loves her son just like I love them.  They made me read the book over and over that night!  It is truly one of my favorite books!!
B000003EUL|4.0|The title says it all, because in this recording, the Brahms concerto comes alive like no other.  The Appassionata, however, comes up far short (and I sadly seem to be alone in this, given the number of reviewers who say that Richter's performance here is the best Appassionata ever).  To me, though, there seems to be little to no life in this Beethoven performance; just a lot of loud banging with little to no emotional or fiery flare.  If you want a good solid performance of the Appassionata, my reccommedation is Walter Klien's version, which comes out like a musical firestorm, just as the Appassionata should--and just as this Brahms concerto does, too.  I've listened to several recordings of the Brahms Second Concerto, and I can safely say that Richter easily blew them all away, so buy this CD for the Brahms.  You won't regret it for a moment.  But if you're looking for a cut-rate Beethoven, you won't find it here.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Let me preface that I LOVE Madonna. I've bought all her CDs, remixes,  DVDs, etc. I think she's one of the most amazing artists of our time. So forgive me Madonna for saying this. This CD it a BIG disappointment! The single Die Another Day is the best track on the disc. The rest of the disc is full of forgettable songs and production that is far below her usual standards.<BR>If you like stale minimalist synth production they you might like this, but if you like well constructed songs with memorable melodies and lyrics that make you think, look somewhere else. These songs sound like the ones that didn't make it on Ray Of Light and for a good reason. If she's going to stick with genre of music, Madonna needs to work with proven producers. Dance production wizards like William Orbit, or BT know how to rock the house, but still understand that the song is king. Madonna is allowed a couple stinkers among all her brilliant work, I was just looking for something fresh from her to raise the bar in pop music again. Maybe next time.
B00005QK39|4.0|Fish-era Marillion was often compared to early, Gabriel-era Genesis. So what?! They also sound like Dave Cousins and The Strawbs. Far from being a copycat band, Marillion took those influences and developed their own musical and lyrical themes. This is an amazing debut...<br />Regarding the REMASTER, it is absolutely essential. The difference between the original CD release and the remaster is night-and-day! The original sounds thin and muddy by comparison. There is so much there that I never heard before - it is truly like hearing the album for the first time. ENJOY!
6300271439|5.0|Madonna is incredible in this movie!  A real dramatic tour-de-force!

0688170528|5.0|This was the first novel that I read by Ms. Picoult.  I do not normally read novels in her genre but my mother gave it to me and one night, when I had virtually dug through my bookshelf for something to read and came up with nothing, I took \\"The Pact\\" out and began to read.  I was INSTANTLY trapped within its pages.  I have never cried, laughed, or felt when reading a book as much as I had with this one.  Since my first time reading it, I have recommended it to numerous friends and I even wrote the Oprah Winfrey show in hopes of having her put it on her book-of-the month club. <BR>And now I recommend it to all of you who are reading this review.  A cautionary note:  This book will swaddle you in a blanket of emotions and trap you with its words.  It is nearly impossible to put this book down without finishing it.  Make sure that you have plenty of quiet solitude to enjoy this masterpiece and make sure to bring plenty of tissues.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna's \\"American Life\\" is centered on three messages: 1) fame ain't what it's cracked up to be, 2) our collective value system is eroding, and 3) she still misses her mother, who passed away when the singer was only six. Reuniting with producer Mirwais, the album cruises through more of the same electropop of 2000's \\"Music\\", but with less obvious hooks, frequent use of the vocoder, and more acoustic guitar, which dominates virtually every song. The results are sometimes pleasant, as evidenced on the title track (whose video Madonna pulled due to its anti-war comment, a strange step for a singer so often known for pushing buttons), the brisk \\"Hollywood,\\" and the folksy \\"X-Static Process,\\" which, musically, is the best and most memorable track on \\"American Life.\\" But while the album is a sometimes lovely listen, its edge gets a bit dulled by not only messages we've already heard before, but lyrics which sound rather elementary for a 44-year-old woman who's had more personal ups and downs than the Nasdaq. She could have really belted out from the pit of her soul. Instead, the lyrics overall don't have the emotional thrust of earlier songs like \\"The Power of Goodbye,\\" \\"In this Life,\\" or \\"Inside of Me.\\" To be sure, Madonna has never been much of a wordsmith, but lines like \\"I always wished that I could find/someone as beautiful as you/but in the process I forgot that I was special too\\" sum up the self-affirmation fluff that nearly marred India.Arie's last album. Her lyric: \\"There was a time I had a mother it was nice\\" is just inferior compared to her lyrics of \\"Like a Prayer\\"'s \\"Promise to Try.\\" In that track, Madonna also mourns the loss of her mother, but it's tough enough to make even grown men misty. And her rapping on the title track, in which she embraces the very materialism she condemns, isn't as cringeworthy as some say it is, but it's wholly unnecessary. Ultimately, \\"American Life\\" doesn't find Madonna in serious danger of losing her title as Queen of Pop, but it's an underwhelming effort that left me somewhat cold. The ideas are great, but the execution left a bit to be desired.ut it's an underwhelming effort that left me somewhat cold. The ideas are great, but the execution left a bit to be desired.
B00005ALRO|4.0|There's no question `The Fugitive' has become a timeless, talked-about thriller that virtually everyone has seen.  And there's great reason why everyone should see this movie.  It's has an excellent cast, good action, a great storyline, great thrills, and even bits of drama here and there.  The acting by Harrison Ford and Tommy Lee Jones obviously stands out, but it's the supporting roles of Joe Pantoliano (who actually brings some comedy to the film), Julianne Moore, and Jeroen Krabbe that help boost the movie's appeal.  There are so many infamous scenes and characterizations that it's even spawned a Leslie Nielsen parody movie, `Wrongfully Accused' (fitting name).  But that's neither here nor there.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, you're missing out on a brilliant piece of film.  Here's a rundown of the movie:<br />The movie starts with some in-and-out scenes, going from past to present.  We first see Dr. Richard Kimble (Ford) at a party with his wife.  Then they leave, she gets murdered, and he gets blamed for it.  It's not really that fast, but it's hard to explain.  We then see Kimble being questioned by police and eventually convicted in a courtroom.  And although we know he's a loveable, sincere doctor, he actually looks like the Unabomber with his beard and distraught haircut.  So to the uninformed, he appears very guilty.  After all this has happened, we (the viewer) still KNOW he didn't do it; they make that very clear.  But as Kimble and fellow inmates are on a bus to be executed, something happens.  The bus crashes.  And although this particular scene is one of the most famous and best ever produced, it's a little unbelievable for it all to unfold as it did.  Nevertheless, it's an action-packed scene that really keeps you entertained.  As you can imagine, Kimble (and another guy) escape from the train wreck and go \\"on the run\\".  That's where Tommy Lee Jones comes in.  After he and his crew take the jurisdiction from some incompetent cops who didn't see the loose footcuffs, he orders people around using a speech that covers every possible scenario and every inch of ground.  In fact, the many speeches and directions he gives are awesome and very entertaining.  One of the reasons this movie is so impressive is because of the ongoing battle between Kimble and Samuel Gerard (Jones).  I'm calling it the battle of smart versus smart.  And that's fitting, because everywhere Kimble goes... there's Gerard.  One of those meetings between the two is also one of the greatest moments in film: the tunnel scene.  Again, it might be somewhat far-fetched, but it is still breathtaking.<br />Another bright spot within the film is the attention to detail.  If you listen and watch Gerard come up with his schemes for catching Kimble, you can't help but say \\"wow\\".  This is not your average cop-chasing-bad-guy-picking-up-clues-type movie.  It's much more than that.  There are numerous unpredictable turns that stand out in a movie that appears, at first glance, to be predictable.  Without those twists the movie would've been more average.  Now, even with the awesome twists and stellar action sequences, the movie isn't perfect.  There might be a few things the movie could've done without.  First, the flashbacks that Kimble has became a little annoying, though they were probably necessary.  And what about the people he contacted?  Wouldn't they be arrested for assisting in a crime?  In the end, I guess it doesn't really matter.<br />`The Fugitive' will no doubt entertain you; while keeping you just on the edge of your seat and ready for anything.  The acting by both Ford and Jones are flat-out amazing, and the supporting cast really adds to the brilliance it already possessed.  This movie is not too predictable, until the very end (how is supposed to end?).  The story is great, letting us wonder if Dr. Kimble's tragic loss was fate or a set-up.  I won't say anymore about the movie, but I will say you need to see it.  This is undoubtedlyone of the must-see movies of the `90s.  Whether or not you like Harrison Ford, Tommy Lee Jones, action movies, thrillers, or just a great movie all in all, watch `The Fugitive'.  It has so many twists and turns that it'll leave you in awe and wanting more.y one of the must-see movies of the `90s.

0441009425|3.0|I can agree with everyone here how well-written Revelation Space is. I give it three stars for the stellar quality of the actual writing style Mr. Reynolds possesses. But the novel's plot is exceedingly complex; characters come and go with astonishing rapidity; and the chapter units are far too short and clipped to sustain any kind of interest over the long haul. And it is a long haul.<br />Like Vernor Vinge and a number of others (Peter Hamilton, Dan Simmons, Stephen Baxter) Mr. Reynolds crams in all kinds of science fiction conceits and mysteries as if we're watching a juggler trying to juggle as many balls as he can when he only cares how good he looks while doing it.  Instead, a few less balls in the air might have made for a better performance. The ideas came fast and furious in this book, but what annoyed me more was Reynolds' habit of writing only a page or two on one character then shifting to another just as the action was getting interesting. He does this so much that after a while all tension falls from the book. I got about halfway through the book before I finally got tired of it and put it down.<br />I suppose that to new readers of SF \\"Revelation Space\\" will appear like a breath of fresh air, but it's really not all that good or memorable. But, boy, can Reynolds write. I give him that.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I have been a fan of the Godfather movies since I was a child, so when I found out that all three movies could be be purchased in one collection on DVD, I was ecstatic!!!!<br />I absolutely love this DVD collection! I not only love the fact that each of the wonderful movies is represented (The Godfather, Part 2 being my favorite), but there is also a fourth disc which contains a documentary with interviews from Francis Ford Coppola and just about every cast member from these incredible films as well as many other extras. There is one particular extra in which you can view the Corleone family tree and learn some interesting facts about each member.<br />I would highly suggest this DVD collection to any fan of the Godfather films. I would also suggest this collection to people who may not be fans of the films, but love to watch good movies. You will not be disappointed at all! This is a masterpiece!!!!
B00006IU73|3.0|I don't know why so many people try to lump this album in with prog rock, it simply isn't progressive. It is a good solid rock cd ranging from accoustic numbers to heavy metal but has none of the long complex instrumental interplay of the Flower Kings or early Yes. The recording is clean but a bit too sterile. Alot of people love this cd and it does have a timeless rock quality to it, but for quality progressive rock you must look elsewhere.
B0000714BP|5.0|I fell in love with \\"Too Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything! Julie Newmar\\" the first time I watched it years ago. Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo did excellent jobs playing three drag queens who turn a very small town upside down, and in the process, change their lives for the better!<br />The interaction between the three \\"ladies\\" will have you rolling with laughter (pay particular attention between the dialog between Noxeema and Chi-Chi)!<br />There is not one bad thing I can say about this film, except I wish a sequel would have been made. Anyone who would love a great laugh should definitely watch this movie! You will not be disappointed at all!!!!
B00005JLXE|4.0|DareDevil is a better movie than Spider-Man!Why?Because in Spider-Man I think the special-effects could have been better.Sometimes it looked like Spider-Man was computerized and cheesy.DareDevil has great effects.The story is awesome.The action is awesome.But I cannot give this film 5 stars.One reason,there are better super hero movies like SuperMan.I love superhero movies but I never read the comic books.So I recommend this film to everyone,But they should of gone more into the story of how he became DareDevil,but I still recommend this great film.
B00001PE4D|4.0|...P>\\"Cruel Intentions\\" revolves around the lives to of a step brother and sister, Katherine and Sebatian (Sarah Michelle Gellar and Ryan Phillipe), who revel in the cruelty of messing up people's lives. The boredom of their high society lifestyle causes them to play with the minds and hearts of innocent people they claim to like. Everything falls apart when Sebatian actually falls in love with one of his conquests.<br />This story is full of sex, betrayal, love, and deceit. It is one that you will be captivated by instantly. The film is also supported by an incredible soundtrack that goes along perfectly with the many moods and emotions exhibited in it. The ending will also have you laughing to yourself as one of the conspirators gets their comeuppance.<br />I would highly suggest watching this movie! You won't be disappointed!!!
B00003CXBH|4.0|The Mission deals with two men with two conflicting views on how to approach their mission which is in danger of being shut down by the Europeans. Rodrigo, a man of sword and Gabriel, a man of prayer and conversation each have their own way of approaching the situations ahead of them. Each listen strongly to their conscience and stick to what he thinks is right. Although there is no right or wrong way to approach a situation, each man chooses to listen to their own conscience and not even take into consideration the views of the other man. In order to build a strong conscience, one must listen to others around them to gain more knowledge about situations and ideas. Rodrigo's choice to fight for his people and Gabriel plea with Rodrigo to stay with God and preach about the goodness of the mission cancel out each other in the end and both men lose the fight to maintain the mission. This, however, is a lesson for all future missions that want to take place. Everyone must agree on how to handle a situation in order for each individual involved to benefit something from it. An idea cannot be ignored in the situation between Rodrigo and Gabriel because people will then take sides and the group as a whole cannot succeed. Both men wanted the same result, for the mission to go on and for the people to be free to do whatever they choose. Rodrigo and Gabriel's conflicting ideas held each individual involved in the missions back from achieving this goal. Conscience is a powerful tool if it is used wisely and to benefit the individuals life and the lives around that person.
0800141660|5.0|Except for the fact that I can't stand the way the Victorians beat around the bush about everything and rarely speak their mind in a plain and straightforward manner, our whole family just loves this movie.  Wonderful actors and actresses portraying interesting characters and a wonderful story where, for the most part, everyone has a happy ending (except the guy that felt that money was more important than true love - and he realized his mistake, in the end).

B00003CXI1|5.0|This film is a fun and charming action film that is magical and touching. It is equally enjoyable for children and adults and those who have and have not read the books. A great beginning to what is sure to be an extremely popular and entertaining film series.

B00008S2VG|2.0|Disappointed is exactly the right word. I am a huge Madonna fan. I've purchased every album as soon as it's come out, going as far back as having &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; on vinyl! But this album has disappointed me. The music is fantastic and very similar to that of her last album &quot;Music&quot; however the lyrics are lacking. It seems Madonna was more interested in making the end of each line rhyme then filling the lyrics with meaningful content. Sadly, this is the first Madonna album that I'm not recommending.
0345360338|5.0|This is the first novel I have read by Ms. Penman, but it definitely will not be the last!  I have read little of this era, except for multiple Bernard Cornwell novels.  She did an excellent job in describing a very complicated story with an even more complicated cast of characters.  I wonder if she needed a score card to keep track when writing.  I can't wait to start my next Penman novel.
0385503954|2.0|This book has so much potential.  It was an interesting idea, the characters were excellent, and McEwan is an excellent writer.  Why, you may ask then, did I give it only two stars?  The Answer is the detail.  There is WAY to much of it.  The paragraphs go on and on like some kind of infernal device designed to destory my love of reading and my sanity. This book could have been about 1/3 the length without changing the plot.  It's like trying to read a bad combination of \\"The Scarlet letter\\" and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  You get the amazingly long and boring descriptions of TSL and the pointless descriptions of upper class characters that are impossible to relate to.  I don't know what McEwan was trying to prove when he wrote this book, but all he proved to me is that this book is filled with pretentious [***] that only arrogent snobs with too much time on their hands can enjoy.  Those of us who deal in reality will not enjoy this novel
B00008S2VG|5.0|Despite the many unwarranted negative reviews, I happen to find this CD inspiring in many ways, so get your copy and discover for urself!
0064471837|5.0|My name is Aaron Trawick, I'm 15 and have read more books then my whole homeroom combined. I just got done reading Sabriel and Lireal and these are by far the best books I've ever read. You can disagree all you want, but I've read the Harry Potter books (J.K. Rowlings), the Lord of the Rings books(J.R.R. Tolkien), The Redwall series (Brain Jacques) and many other great books by great authors, but Garth Nix has outdone them all. I tell any sceince fiction lover to read these books.<br />Aaron Trawick ADT
B000002J1L|5.0|If you are thinking on buying this album, it's probably because you already know and enjoy the Gabriel-period sounding of Genesis.<BR>In that case, you have a 5% chance of NOT liking Nursery Crime.<br />You'll find classic progressive pieces as The Return of the Giant Hogweed (powerful closing-section!), Seven Stones and The Fountain of the Salmacis, a song in which Banks, Phil and Mike are all great. You'll hear Phil Collins leading vocals for the 1st time in a short and pleasant moment (at least when compared with More Fool Me...). <br />But, above all that, you have The Perfect Song - The Musical Box.<BR>All adjectives are few to define my feelings for this song. All instruments are played with such a talent that it's not possible to point out one above the others. What a debut for this line-up! The closing section is simply magnificent. Trust me, you'll never ever get tired of hearing it.
B0000017CA|5.0|This is better than Pagean Terrorism Tacticts by far. I just wish they were still together... Oh Well!  This is an awesome cd. The best tracks are The Blue, Tranquilized, Cheap Vodka, Finger Paintings Of The Insane, Jezebel, What Color Is Death, And Cassie Eats Cockraoches.
B00008S2VG|4.0|When I first heard the single, &quot;American Life&quot; I liked it immediately, due to the fact that it was so different.  I bought the album and I like it more each time I play it.  The album is so incredibly different than Madonna's last album, &quot;Music&quot;.  I must admit it took a few listens to get a feel for it but I like it.  Stand out tracks are, &quot;Nothing Fails,&quot; &quot;Hollywood,&quot; as well as the title cut.  I will say this album has an amazing bass to it and I couldn't take my eyes off the cover.  Madonna reminds me of Patty Hearst when I look at the pictures of her with a machine gun.  Madonna will do well with this album regardless of what her critcs are saying.
B000084T18|4.0|Its time for people to let Tupac go, and stop comparing every new rap album to Tupac's albums.  50 cent is not Tupac. His lyrics and style are completely different. If you want to pick up a rap album with solid production and almost effortless flow, go get 50's album.  If you want to hear Tupac, go listen to &quot;Me Against the World.&quot;  And if all you want to hear is Tupac, stop writing reviews of other rappers' albums.
B00004T9UF|1.0|i don't like eminem at all... HE IS dissing his own parents to get recongnition, he himself is a PHONY, he thinks the world owes him, well i just wanna tell him that, he's not the only one from a dyfunctional family, many famous people were from much worst situation that he's in, or was, and those famous people get much more fame by working hard and following the right path, and they are much more successful than eminem.
0684833395|5.0|this is  a really difficult book to truly follow- however with much effort, and time, the characters, especially Yossarian, are brought to life and compassionate! I attempted to read this about 10 years ago, and put it down early. Now, after finally completing Atlas Shrugged (another tough read that took me two tries), picked it up again, read it through and enjoyed the predicament that poor Yossarian finds himself in (how to get out of flying that next bombing run). One recommendation- see the movie of the same name after reading the book, so that you can appreciate the effort that went into making a movie of it... Also, anyone who says &quot;&quot;catch 22&quot; saw the movie it was great&quot; who didn't read the book can have no clue about the true meaning of Heller's classic!

Screen message<br />&quot; please insert a disk&quot; Disk is inserted.<br />Used second DVD player and it worked until intermission.<br />Disk stopped and would not run. We tried everything.<br />Since I love this story~ How do i get it replaced with a good DVD<br />MIchael Karaffa
B00008S2VG|3.0|For the hours after buying this album, I played it over and over again. I was trying to justify why I had spent my lunch break walking across town to the record store and I was furthermore trying to justify why I had shelled out a single penny for this disc.<br />The more I listened to it, the more listener-friendly it became. I suppose the cost alone was worth \\"Die Another Day\\".  But I kept listening, and found a few other gems. \\"Hollywood\\" is a guilty pleasure, as is \\"love Porfusion\\" and perhaps even \\"Mother and Father\\". \\"American Life\\" would have been fine if she hadn't rapped on it. (Subtle after-effects of her time spent with Vanilla Ice?)<br />The album ends up being likeable but just mediocre. What it's missing is a good, heavy bass and drums.  Remixed, this could be quite danceable. The simple lyrics are perfect for some fun, mindless dance music. <br />Some DJs will have a great time playing around and experimenting with the raw girl-and-her-guitar sound.  <br />The key is to just wait and buy those instead.
0800177177|4.0|Different than the previous versions you may have seen.  Gives a new perspective on the fabled tale. Gary Oldman turns in a fine performance as the Count.  The photography is stunning.<BR>I still prefer the 1979 Dracual with Frank Langella, but this one follows close on its heels.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna is always constantly changing.  This music shows artistic and life growth.  The album is placed in cold techno beats yet again, but the songs all fit together with their views on American Life (reason for the title of course.)I have been a fan of Madonna since forever and she has yet to make a truly dissappointing CD.  This just makes it known that she's a force of America, whether she lives here or not!  Get It Soon!!  You won't regret it.
6305078181|4.0|Out of all versions of this story that I've seen, this ranks as the most elegant.  I always thought Christopher Lee as the ultimate Dracula, until I saw Frank Langella in the role.  A very classy, beautifully photographed interpretation of the vampire tale.  The ending especially was intriguing, if not entirely accurate to the original story.  Laurence Olivier never disappoints as the vampire hunter.  Good cast all around.  The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is because the colors tend to wash out on occasion.  A good remastering is in order to bring the coloring back to life.
B000089RVX|5.0|In one word: AMAZING!!! This is one of the best cd's I've ever played in my player. Amy lee's vocals are beautiful, deep, & haunting. When she sings, you don't just hear it, you feel it. The music is also great. It's heavy, but the piano & keyboards add so much more depth to it all. Every song's a 10, but ones that stand out to me are:Going Under, My Immortal, Haunted, Hello, & My Last Breath. I highly recommend this cd, it's worth every dollar!
B00008S2VG|3.0|If you liked &quot;Music&quot; and like electronic music in general, this will definitely satisfy your electro-ears. Sound wise it picks up where Music left off, but is much tighter in terms the overall theme. The arrangements are very spare on most songs, and although I like the varied sound of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; - it works to the advantage of this album. It is also very experimental in that it doesn't always follow the standart pop song structure &amp; the beat is often stretched in all directions. That said, the album has some strong themes, but the lyrics are often so weak &amp; repetative that you only wish she tried a bit harder. &quot;I'm So Stupid&quot; is the most amazing track I've heard! Other highlights include &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, Mother &amp; Father&quot;
B000000XB9|5.0|THE FIRST FOUR SELECTIONS: \\"SUSIE Q\\" \\"I PUT A SPELL ON YOU\\" \\"PROUD MARY\\" \\"BAD MOON RISING\\" ARE WORTH THE PRICE ALONE. BUT THE TOPPER IS TO HEAR AN ELEVEN MINUTE VERSION OF \\"I HEARD IT THROUGH THE GRAPEVINE\\" THAT JUST KNOCKS ONE OFF THEIR FEET. FOUR GUYS PLAYING 1 BASS 2 GUITARS AND A DRUM. THEY MAKE MUSIC FUN. JOHN FOGERTY'S VOCAL ON \\"HAVE YOU EVER SEEN THE RAIN\\" IS MELODIOUS AND MELANCHOLIC AND BLENDS WITH THE INSTRUMENTATION OF EQUAL CHARACTERISTIC. IT JUST DOES NOT GET BETTER THAN THIS. WHAT ARMSTRONG IS TO JAZZ, THE BEATLES TO POP AND SINATRA TO STANDARD, CCR IS TO CLASSIC 60'S ROCK. EACH DEFINES THEIR GENRE.
B00005LC1H|5.0|John Cleese is Basil Fawlty, a cranky English innkeeper who finds misery in his job and is determined to help everyone else find it as well.  The trials and tribulations of Mr. Fawlty are widely recognized as some of the best comedy TV ever made, and for good reason.  For better or worse, the series didn't have to stand up to the test of 100+ episodes, but the 12 they did make are absolutely priceless.<br />It usually starts out with a simple problem, usually a result of Basil's contempt for his customers (a recurring theme is his desire to attract a \\"higher class\\" of boarder) or his tight-fistedness.  The problem is then exacerbated by the help or the customers or by Basil's wife, resulting in total disaster and Fawlty's inevitable descent into hysterics.  If there's one thing that John Cleese can do well it's pitch a fit, and he does this with hilarious efficiency throughout the series.  Whether it be because his car has broken down or there's a dead man in the hotel, Cleese's gift for physical comedy is on display in all its glory.  The supporting cast is also excellent. There's the bellhop Manuel, whose failure to grasp the English language (along with his pet rat) makes for some interesting situations. Then there's Basil's wife, who recognizes Basil's knack for heaving himself headlong off the ship of reasonable behavior, and has long since stopped throwing him a rope.  Finally, there's Polly, the maid, who is the most reasonable person at the hotel, but always gets involved as an accomplice in someone's shenanigans.  And let's not forget the patrons of Fawlty Towers, who run the gamut from perfectly reasonable to psychotic (the Waldorf Salad guy comes to mind) to dead.  All these elements, along with the talent of the cast, combine to make for great situational comedy<br />This is truly an original TV classic, and the humor and writing is so well done that it deserves to be seen over and over again.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I really like this CD. But I love my edited version.<BR>After taking a pole of the 2, 3 & 4 star amazon reviews,<BR>I got an idea of what the real fan favorites are.<BR>So I programmed the old Cd player: <BR>01) Whats the world coming to <BR>04) Thrown down  <BR>05) Miranda<BR>07) Say you will<BR>08) Peacekeeper <BR>11) Running thru the garden <BR>13) Steal your heart away<BR>14) Bleed to love her<BR>15) Everybody finds out<BR>16) Destiny Rules<BR>17) Say Goodbye<BR>Yes!!! It does take me back to the days of 33 1/3's . But what's really nice is, if I get tired of these songs, there are plenty more.<BR>And a couple years from now I'll be really glad it is a long (76 minute, 15 second) disc. It may be years until another. Thanks FM<BR>album.
B000069AUI|5.0|Parachutes inspired me to get back to piano playing after 10 years. This latest album has got me going again, the piano in this music is so dramatic, moody, and makes it easier for me to play again. I would love to see them live! <BR>I give the group a lot of credit for getting the dust cover off my baby grand and enjoying piano playing again.<BR>They just get better and better, keep it up guys! I am British too and it is good to see great bands still coming out of England.
B00003CXDU|5.0|With my like of space movies such as Star Wars, I was happy to find this movie. It is totally funny and has Laugh out loud lines that have stuck with me! My brother and I can't stop laughing! But beware of it's PG rating, there is much cussing in this film, other wise it's one of the best!
0131103628|5.0|This is the one and only book to have on the C programming language, written by the original developers of the language.  It covers all of the syntactic and semantic issues of the language.  Any question regarding C can be answered here and can be located quickly thanks to its good index.  I am impressed by the completeness of this text, it includes very useful information such as: precedence and associativity rules, bit-wise operators, the preprocessor, control structures, pointers, the standard C library, I/O, interaction with the UNIX operating system, and a complete language specification.  The list goes on!         For nearly every feature of the language, there are very useful exercises that will either familiarize the reader with the feature or clarify the reader's previous knowledge.  Although many of the examples are targeted towards intermediate or advanced programmers, beginning programmers should be able to get a lot out of many of the examples.         I have purchased many 1000+ page books on different languages including C and have found that many are incomplete and spend numerous pages on topics that can be stated in one or two paragraphs.  This book in around 250 pages covers everything you need to know about the C programming language and I would highly recommend getting a copy for your own library.
B00008S2VH|5.0|After the brilliance of Music I was wondering what she would come up with next and true to form the Queen of pop delivered her best album to date so if you loved music then you'll love this even better follow up
B00008S2VH|3.0|I thought the limited edition was a bit disappointing.  There were supposed to be a dvd that came with this but I assumed it was pulled the last minute when Madonna decided to recalled her video.  This left the limited edition cd with only a poster and a sheet of stamps.  In addition, the enhanced cd promised Madonna extras only for this limited edition was false.  I put the cd in my computer and it brings me the exact same stuff that the enhanced cd single already has.  I think she needs better marketing people to package her products.<br />The album itself is good.  Good but not great.  I think she needs better songwriters.  The lyrics seems a bit cliche.  <BR>She talks about moving forward but I don't think she has any new topics to move forward with.  It's the same topic she covered in her last albums and tours.  Material things don't buy happiness...WE GET IT!  Tell that to people who are poor!
B00008J4P5|5.0|.<br />Striped light. <br />White Heat, White Light. Everything from The Velvent Underground, Robert Plant, Captain Beefheart, Frank Black, The Stooges, John Lennon, Mott the Hoople, The Kinks, and another bushel of Brit rock inspirations. The range of styles and genre of The White Stipes is unlike anything I've ever experienced before.<br />This is a simple and fantastic record. Sonically perfect and cleanly recorded on analog 8-track.<br />Jack White is reminiscent of a rapidly-developing young David Bowie, finding his voice and then running across the finish line with it. Mr. and Ms. White are clearly having the times of their lives and the result is crystal clear rock n'roll. On \\"Elephant\\", Jack White goes where he wants to go and you just get pulled right along. <br />The lyric verse and chorus style are deeply seeded in classic rock and roll tradition. The Drum is heavily miked for that big Detroit sound. And guitar is beautifully balanced on the jagged edge. <br />\\"Elephant\\" could almost be classified as Classic Motor-city Music, but The Stooges never had this much energy and Jack and Meg are only half of the teampower as Iggy and the boys. Quite a powerful output from the former husband and wife duo.<br />I won't detail every song. But If you want a retro trip that takes you from The Sex Pistols to The Mamas and the Papas, you are in for a real treat.<br />KB

B00008S2VH|5.0|The American Life album, in my opinion, is Madonna's best work of art yet! Each song on the album is completely different from anything she's ever done before. The CD is full of guitar mixed with many new electronic beats - it even has Madonna rapping in a couple of songs! I would DEFINITELY recommend American Life to anyone. ROCK ON MADGE!
0553381687|5.0|In my original review I said this book was better than Lord of the Rings but having read the next three books and seeing all that was set up in the first book, I can't even compare it to LOTR anymore; it goes so far beyond it.  I have only one warning for people starting this series: reading these books will make it seem like other authors have the writing skills of children.
0446608955|5.0|This book was so well written and easy to read.  I found myself not able to put it down.  I easy got teary-eyed from time to time.  That usually only happens to me in a movie.
0553579908|5.0|This book follows A Game of Thrones perfectly!  On the second read through I appreciated even more the build up toward the fantastic ending!
B00006CXXU|4.0|There is no doubt about it guys. This girl can sing. This Cd is full of good songs, great melodys and catchy beats. The only reason I pulled back from that one star to make it 5. Is her warbrobe. No no Christina, that is not you. Usually people who can't sing dresses like this for attention. You have the voice and your own look. Leave Pink alone. Otherwise, I could name all the tracks on this Cd that is really good, I won't cause it's the whole CD. From &quot;Beautiful&quot; to &quot; Fighter&quot;. All good. Who ever doesn't like this album, doesn't know a thing about music. Good Job. Next CD I will be in front of line to purchase it, just put on some cloths.
055357342X|5.0|Just when you think things can't get any more out of control it does!  This is my favorite book in the series and that's saying a lot.
B000001EXR|5.0|As the title said, I think this album is the best Kiss has done.Sure, they changed their music style a little, but I think they improved themselves on this one. better than \\"psycho circus\\", thats for sure. ...
B00008DDXC|2.0|I think that this movie is extraordinarily boring.  Unlike the first film, which took some liberties with the material in the interests of time, the sequel simply left out some of the most charming scenes in the book without really transitioning to the next event.  The cast was, of course, excellent, and the sets wonderful, but the film was so predictable in every aspect that watching it was a tedious chore.  A literary adaptation is only good if it contributes something new to the material, and this one doesn't.
B000001FY9|5.0|Excellent compilation of Bob Marley's best work. Soothing reggae rhythms and beats combined with touching vocals by Bob and the background vocalists. The guitar and keyboard solos are extremely well defined.<br />Some tunes have a political message and others are more sweet and gentle. Three Little Birds and One Love/People Get Ready will have you in a great mood all day while Get Up Stand Up and I Shot The Sheriff will have you in the mood to fight your oppressors. And Jamming is just the ideal party tune.<br />A super introduction to reggae music.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|&quot;Say You Will&quot; is full of stunning surprises and personal confessions.  &quot;Come&quot; addresses the obvious void here -- it's a beautiful cry to Christie McVie to come back to Fleetwood Mac.   Of course, she's out of the mix, now -- which leaves Lindsey and Stevie to get closer than they've been in decades!  Lindsey's &quot;Red Rover&quot; gets right to the heart of things, seemingly comparing love to a dog park where all the creatures are sniffing the breeze for clues.  But watch out Lindsey, Stevie gets even more experimental with her gypsy raps.  A strange and tantalizing brew of the old Mac stew!
B00005R2M3|4.0|Fun is the best way for me to describe this album. There are so many great pop songs on here, that you can't stop singing along to, that more often than not when you get to the end of the CD you just have to play it again! While I like a good ballad as much as the next romantic,it is the faster songs that are more fun here. &quot;Objection&quot; is a great song,the type of song that rushes you along and has you singing (and maybe dancing) before you realise. Similarly, songs like &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; and &quot;Fool&quot; (which has catchy, funny lyrics) also get you singing and dancing along, great pop songs that leave you wanting more when they finish. Including Spanish language versions of these songs also works really well, even though I don't speak Spanish!<br />There are a couple of weak moments. &quot;Poem to a horse&quot; is a little weird, and while the ballads like &quot;Underneath your clothes&quot; and &quot;The One&quot; are OK, they are a little sameyand one of these only would have sufficed. But overall, this is a great album for people that enjoy pop music. It's not going to change the world, but fun and enjoyment are both essentials of life - and this album provides both.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Hi, I heard this album first on mtv.com, it is diferent, very diferent than her previous works and probaby it will cause a bit of a shock to her fans, but if you hear it more than once youll see that its not that bad, actually I bought it yesterday and I think it was a good shop, it may wont have the comercial succes of &quot;Music&quot; or any other album of Madonna, but itll proove that She can surprise us anytime she want.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is quite possibly the best \\"concept\\" album released since \\"The Wall\\". The way this album was put together just boggles my mind. From start to finish the album just gels into the next song. This album also takes experimental and puts it into rock music. If you're looking for something a bit off center and have time to listen to the album all the way thru when you get it, then check this out. If you don't like it you can always trade it in.
B00008AY3L|1.0|the music industry continues to give consumers weak product. this is a great example of the weakness of so called rock music at the present time. <br />this album is so ridiculus. it sounds as if this guy wrote all his songs on the can in some waffle house. splash. probably the same one i ate at, because amazingly both ben and i produced the same product. except his smells a little worse.<br />don't waste your money. this dood has no soul. i guess he sold it
B000089RVX|5.0|This CD is a 5++++++++++. Her voice is so beautiful. When I first heard their music on the radio I was like, WOOOOOW - her voice, who is this?  It's really refreshing &amp; unique to hear a band w/ such suffisticated Angelic vocals. I also like how they utilize classical ingredients like piano &amp; violin in their music that creates such an appealing sound, especially in the beautiful &amp; tranquil Sarah Mcglauchlin type song &quot;My Immortal&quot;. I love all types of music (w/exception of so called music - rap) &amp; this CD is definitely one of my favorites. Her vocals bring such a mesmerizing and captivating uniqueness in their music. This CD is a definite must have.  A BRILLIANT compilation of musical genius.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Gosh, if I was able to give this cd a 0 star, I would. This cd is sooo bad. Who is this guy, anyway??!!! The only good thing about this cd is by the time the second song was played, I was in LA-LA land. The best sleep anyone can ask for. Like everyone on here, I feel his song \\"Your Body Is A Wonderland\\" or whatever that ... was, makes it the worst song of the decade. Can you imagine a guy telling you that your body is a wonderland? I can't and if it happens, I am keeping away from him!!! You should do the same...keep away from this cd. Trust me!!
B00008OLYN|5.0|The Opeth war machine has two sides, and they decided to release one album to show off each side.  The heavy, intense, brooding side was shown on their December 2002 release, &quot;Deliverance&quot;.  Now, they show off their mellow and relaxing side on the quiet, blues-like &quot;Damnation&quot;.<BR>         All tracks are done on acoustic guitar for this album.  Everything about it is relaxing, quiet, and something that both metalheads and maybe even some older people can get into.  Opeth fans know of these two sides, and love both of them.  &quot;Damnation&quot; shows off the musical side, with a slower, Dave Matthews-esque style on the drums of Martin Lopez, a much more obvious prescence (as well as some much better work) on bass of Martin Mendez, and light, slow guitars by Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren.  Akerfeldt's vocals also take center stage, with a sweet, John Wetton-esque croon throughout the entire album, rather than the demonic roar that he utilizes on &quot;Deliverance&quot;.<BR>           Those who are new to Opeth don't want this just yet.  If you are a blues fan, or know and love Opeth for their softer side, then this is for you.  If you like their heavy side, get &quot;Deliverance&quot;, and if you like both, start with &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; and then get &quot;Damnation&quot; and &quot;Deliverance&quot;.  Overall, I found this to be a superb album that almost anyone can enjoy.  Get it, you won't be let down.
0312979479|5.0|THis is by far my favorite mystery story! and it's an excellent buy at this price! I recommend it to everyone!
6305263248|5.0|Plot be damned, this is a fine film, using the dark gritty formula of days long past.  Of course, it also calls on the skills of an incredible array of stunt drivers to deliver the chase sequences, in place of savvy camera angles and computer generation.  The chase sequences, whether on foot or on wheels are just exhillarating!  <br />Other reviewers have covered the plot enough for you, what little there is.  Some reviewers have spoiled some of the double crosses for you (shame on them).  I'll stick to an assessment of the film's merits.  <br />Performances:  Outstanding!  Again, in the dark fashion of 1970s noir.  This is not a DeNiro film.  Its an ensemble, so be sure to catch Pryce, Skarsgaard, and the others.  And everyone plays an intensely dark character.  Pryce's and Skarsgaard's characters are among the most vile I've seen in a while.<br />Chase/action sequences:  The film's real star.  For cinema car chase buffs, this is the Bullitt of the 1990s...there is no question.  Ok, maybe the Bullitt/Italian Job of the 1990s.  But while the Steve McQueen classic relied on one car chase and little else, this film has two incredible chase sequences, one in the French countryside, and the other in the heart of Paris.  If there's one detractor to the chase sequences its that parts of it take place in the very tunnels where Princess Diana was killed (it was filmed shortly after her death).  Some might view that as tacky, but there are segments that demonstrate just how her death probably occurred.  The Paris chase sequence is particularly brutal but it is delicious film fare.<br />Even the chase sequences on foot look like they hurt.  There's one segment in an outdoor amphitheater that made me wince...that had to hurt!<br />Cinematography:  First rate.  The arial shot of the exploding Citroen as it rockets down a highway in the French countryside should be in your Fodor's travelogue, as should the scenes where cars are plowing into quaint outdoor cafes.  I don't think there's a part of France I didn't explore (and lay to waste) after viewing this film.  And it makes me want to go there.  Perhaps they will have the outdoor cafes rebuilt by the time I get there.<br />Bottom line:  This film is not to be missed for old school action film fans.  Matrix fans, you ain't got nothin on this film.
B00005AAFS|5.0|This album is great, it is simply aggresive, heartfelt and haunting. Heres a run down on each track.<br />1.MEIN HERZ BRENNT(my heart burns): A nice song. I love it how Till Lindemann goes agressive on the chorus and yells \\"mein herz brennt,\\" and the string arrangements are sweet which are played by Olsen Involtini, who also helps out in the other songs mutter and nebel. 8/10<br />2.LINKS 234(left 234): A great song, kinda like a german march song. This is kinda like the anthem for rammstein fans, any way this song is more catchy than rammsteins stuff, and its a great song. 10/10<br />3.SONNE(sun): My personal favourite song on the album, its very dark and haunting, and as the song gets closer to the end you hear a haunting sample of some female. Great song. 10/10<br />4.ICH WILL(i want): A good song, probably the most well known song on the album, and it would have been better if it wasn't so overplayed, any way angry vocals and excellent chorus. 8/10<br />5.FEUER FREI!(fire free): Great song, very fast, catchy. I like it how this song starts out with sad kind of music and then all of a sudden the music goes aggressive. Great song which was featured on the triple x soundtrack. oh and the track translated isn't fire its fire free. 9/10<br />6.MUTTER(mother): Wow! Great song, slow, sad and heartfelt. I love the bit where Olsen Involtini plays his violin and then you hear Till Lindemann whisper \\"mutter\\" and then yell \\"mutter\\". I also like it how the beginning easily remindes you that this is going to be a sad song. 10/10<br />7.SPIELUHR(music box): I like this song, its like magic, it has this gloomy feel which makes me relaxed, and i like the bit where Khira Li(the kid) pops out and starts singing. This is very close to being my favourite song on the album but not quite. Great song though i must say. 10/10<br />8.ZWITTER(hermaphrodite): A good song. This is mainly just a song poking fun at hermaphrodites, and yes when i read the lyrics translated, i was laughing my head off but any way great song and nice guitar riffs. 8/10<br />9.REIN RAUS(in out): A very gross song talking about sex. Not a bad song, though i can see why it seems to be the least liked song on the album. It also has a disgusting sample in the song with some sex noises. Oh well any way, good song. 7/10<br />10.ADIOS(spanish for bye): Nothing really special in this song, fair guitar riffs, though its a bit boring. This is the worst song on the album. This is the only disapointment in the album. 5/10<br />11.NEBEL(fog): Such a great way to end the album, this songs great. Very slow and nice and bobo the back ground vocal is amazing, this song has very lovely music aswell and nice string arrangemnts by Olsen Involtini. 10/10<br />So overall go get this album, they are difinately the best german band in the world, and one of the best industrial bands alive. Go buy this album. THANKYOU FOR READING-peace
B00008OLYN|5.0|Opeth have done it again. Given the expectations for this album, they have exceeded them and then some. beautiful, forlorn melodies waft their way through depressed vocals to create a truly dark and yet beautiful soundscape. while lacking the night-day contrast of their other albums, Damnation has the almost ethereal sense of melody, one that never forces you, but creeps upon you. the instrumentation is superbly fitting. never over-or under-played, the music fits the mood perfectly. <br />honestly i was afraid the heavy steven wilson influence would turn this into a porcupine tree album. but it shows the strength of mikael's vision that his identifiable &quot;sound&quot; is unmistakable in this album.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|If you want to live in 1975, go play Rumors.  This is vital music today.  I think Lindsay is a guitar genius.  His songs are different from Stevie's.  They always have been.  The push and pull between Stevie's more classic rock leanings and Lindsay's experimental nature is what makes this ablum an instant classic in my mind.  This album is like a history lesson of the band with a view to the future.  Nicely done guys.<br />Sure, I miss Christine too, even more than I thought I would.  But that doesn't stop this album from being a monster and a FW classic.
B000089RVX|5.0|that's the only word that comes close to describing this cd. it's about freaking time we got a female who truly rocks, with such an enchanting voice to boot. she can change her voice from strong to soft at the drop of a dime, and make both of them sound great. this cd is all i have been able to listen to for days. if you like bring me to life, you will love this cd. if some of your other musical favorites are tori amos and tool (like mine), you will love this cd. if you have even considered picking up this cd, get it. you will not be disappointed.
0553103547|5.0|I picked up this book completely by accident, but could not put it down afterwards. The plot only gets better as the books go on, and unlike many other fantasy books, Martin keeps it interesting. Expect bizzare twists of fate and character assassinations of seemingly intergral people in the book; a great read.
B00008O0WN|3.0|The 10th Star Trek movie finally came, and as an avid Trek fan I waited for the occasion.  OK, let me say what I felt.  The film is not as bad as I was afraid, showing some good special effects and interesting cameos like Brian Singer or Kate Mulgrew.  And there is an ending that is clearly intended to surprise us, but ... yes, that is exactly the problem.  The fate of one of the beloved crew doesn't have enough impact to move us.  I think everything could be different with another directo like Jonathan Frakes, who surely knows and respects the world of Star Trek. <br />The story is a decent one, if not perfect or original.  Shinzon (Tom Hardy), \\"nemesis\\" of Captain Picard, shows up before the starship Enterprise to threaten the mass destruction of the whole universe.  This time he seems more powerful (and human) than previous enemies like Borg, and before we know it, he can control the politics of the Romulans, one of the most strong groups of the space.  Along this main plot, there are some about the long-delayed marriage of Riker, and the android named B-4, another \\"alter ego\\" of DATA.<br />Let us not talk about the coherence about the story.  Yes, we don't know why Worf is here while we think we saw him at Deep Space Nine.  We are glad to have him as long as the total result of the film is good.  To be fair, the film gives more actions enhanced by recent CGIs, so the battle sequences are better than anything you ever saw before.  At least writer John Logan (\\"Gladiator\\") is a fan of the series, and he inserts some good in-jokes concerning the series.  And he didn't forget to give some lines to say to Beverly Crusher, who had been always treated as if she isn't there. <br />But ... I didn't like the film very much.  Sorry, but fans, how can you forgive it when you see Wesley Crusher in the opening scene, but doens't have any line to say?  You will miss him if you blink, and the scene looks as if the editor thought he is not worth giving some time to reappear in the film.  Or, see how the film ends, like I said.  Yes, the impact should be much, much more.  But what you see is just a hurriedly done wrap-up of the confused situation.  I cannot disclose much, but I can say this; they should have seen the \\"The Wrath of Khan\\" again, and how to make a truely emotional conclusion of the film.  Alas, but in \\"Nemesis\\" he is just wasted.  <br />The greatest problem is perhaps the film looks very indecisive about whether or not the series should go on.  Some say the 10th installment is the last while others deny it.  I don't know which is true, but the film tries to satisfy the both views, and as a result lacks the courage to push the story further than on TV.  Director Stuwart Baird, it is clear, is trying to meets the needs from fans and non-fans, but as a result, though it is not a bad one like the fifth Trek film, it lacks the momentum to reach the best, namely \\"Khan.\\"
B00003CXXJ|5.0|This is one of those rare gems of a movie that holds you from the first minute, presents immediately likable characters, and tells a very simple story and has fun doing it.  There's some crudeness here, but nothing more crude than I've heard more than a few six-year-olds share.  What's most impressive to me is the care and compassion with which the filmmakers treat the characters while still making sure that this film is a blast.<br />The story has its limitations, and it's not the most original of stories, but then again, neither was anything that Shakespeare wrote--Shakespeare borrowed well-known plots and created exceptional characters with wonderful lines, and I find the same thing here.  If you want to enjoy a funny, thoughtful, reverent film, pull up a chair and be ready to laugh, to be angry at the silly little king wanna-be, and to be sad that things might not work out for our hero and heroine--just enjoy this one, because that's what it was made for.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Is it possible to express divine beauty amidst chaotic turmoil?  Opeth has proven it is , six times over.  A quartet of master musicians from Sweden, their unusual mix of European black metal and 70's progressive, and their ability to pull it off well, has dazzled metal fans all over the world.  Until now, their signature 70's progressive sound was merely a background fill to their ferocious dirges, but with their 7th masterpiece, \\"Damnation,\\" the demons of Opeth have suppressed their livid harmony to humbly submerge themselves and their listeners in musical expressions of sorrow, regret, depression and heartbreak.  They've made an entire album exclusively showcasing their 70's progressive sound.  Without distorted guitars and vicious vocals, Opeth can still move mountains with their soaring melodies and unprecedented skill in songwriting.  This is the one Opeth album everyone can enjoy, even people who don't like rock or metal.  Buy 20 copies and give them to friends and family.  Everyone needs to have this album.
B0000508U6|2.0|Angst, angst, angst. That sums up the \\"Parachutes\\" album nicely. \\"Yellow\\" is a good song, but the lyrics scream \\"I dug this out of my 7th grade notebook!\\". \\"And they were all yellow\\"? Right. So is mustard. Anyway, the cd is, like other reviewers have noted, a good alternative to barbituates for insomniacs. It's one huge wash of angst, guitar riffs that sound like they were the rejects for a Dave Matthews Band song (\\"Crash into me\\" comes to mind, or maybe even \\"I did It\\") and something resembeling yodeling. (Or at least random voice pitching. \\"For you I'd bleed myself dry\\" comes across sounding like \\"For YOOOU I'd BLE-eed MY-self DR-Y\\"). But hey, angst seems to be what sales these days, and if you have to rehash the same idea 20 times over (\\"Oh no I lost my girlfriend/loved one/ my goldfish died and I'm having problems doing my taxe income! OH, ANGST!\\"), then you're either a) really, REALLY creative or b)..... A good album for 8th graders and below who like to scream that \\"COLDPLAY IS THE BEST!!!11111!!!\\", for the rest of you, go buy some Radiohead albums and pass on this one, you're not missing much.
B000083C49|5.0|Considered by many to be the best in the series, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home finds Kirk, Spock, and crew traveling back in time to the twentieth century in hopes of finding humpback whales whose unique sounds are similar to those of a mysterious probe which is ravaging Earth.  The storyline may sound flat on paper, but thanks to a smart and humerous script, capable directing from Leonard Nimoy, and the great chemistry between the Trek crew (and the interaction between them and the San Francisco of 1986), this installment is undoubtadly the most fun and entertaining in the series.  The film was a phenominal hit when released, and paved the way for more sequels to come.  The Special Edition DVD is worth noting as well; the commentary from Nimoy and William Shatner is a must hear for any Trekkie, and the production featurettes on the making of the film are actually very interesting.  Next to The Wrath of Khan Director's Edition DVD, this is Paramount's best DVD edition of a Star Trek film.
B00005JKHN|4.0|Before the hardcore Disneyphiles ready their pitchforks, let me explain that yes, I enjoyed the movie when I was younger, I enjoyed the songs and the characters and the overall experience. However, rewatching it recently I've noted that most of the points people seem to rave about (the music, the villaness) are borderline cliched when compared to other Disney movies. Maleficent is evil, sure, and yes her pet bird is cool but she's far from the end-all-be-all of Disney villanry. Aurora/Sleeping Beauty is the epitome of a boy-crazy 16 year old girl (complete with the \\"But WHY can't I fall in love with the Prince?!\\" whine-scene reminescent of the entire \\"Triton arguing with Ariel\\" scene(s) from that -other- Disney movie, \\"The Little Mermaid\\"), but her singing voice is fair enough, so that can be overlooked (to an extent). The 3 fairies were mere fodder. Amusing, and sometimes laugh-worthy, but mostly there just to hold the story together. The deus-ex-machinas that crawled out of the woodwork for the 2nd half of the film were less than belivable, and mostly cringe-worthy. (example: \\"Aurora's walking into a corridor! It's Malifecent!\\" and later the faires just -happen- to know Malifecent's weak spot..? Ri-ght..) Disney has been known to overhype the snot out of their dvd releases, and this will be no exeption. The special features -sound- like they'd be something that would intrest the average child viewer, but from an adult standpoint, they reek of \\"Fodder made in less than 2 months just so we could take up the 2nd dvd.\\" A making of special, a few games and some other random things that Disney whipped up in less time than it took to actually create the film. All in all, buy it if you don't want to settle for the VHS tape or if you're the kind of person who absolutely has to have -every- Disney DVD that's released, but otherwise, stick with the VHS tape or see if you can buy it secondhand.
B000002UKS|5.0|Probably the best album to ever be released by the Foo Fighters, \\"The Colour & The Shape\\" further solidified Dave Grohl stepping out of grunge's shadow and making peace with the ghost of Kurt Cobain.  Just about all the songs here on this album are catchy and seem made for radio friendly, but underneath that surface is a demonically comical feel combined with a lot of emotion.  On songs like the short opener \\"Doll\\", \\"February Stars\\", and the classic single \\"Everlong\\" you can hear the raw emotion in Grohl's voice, and that is something that no one can fake.  \\"Monkey Wrench\\" is still a great song, no matter how much it got overplayed, although another session of \\"My Hero\\" may prove nerve wracking considering it can be heard just about anywhere.  Other great songs like \\"My Poor Brain\\", \\"See You\\", and \\"Walking After You\\" (featured on the X-Files film soundtrack) are all great songs as well, and the band's tight musicianship rounds out this excellent package.  All in all, \\"The Colour & The Shape\\" is in my opinion the best Foo Fighters album yet, and is undoubtadly one of the finest albums of the 90's.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radioheads 1997 release OK Computer was a different sort of album than they had made in the past. After the amazing The Bends fans didnt know what to expect of their following. Ok Computer was a hell of a surprise and indeed opened them for a whole legion of fans and success without alienating their fans they had before. The songwriting is a lot more loose. There are more instruments and the arrangements are different. The production is amazing and they decided to hire the right man for the job Nigel Gothridge who is a genius. He and the band were set on to make an album so unforgettable that once you start listening to it you cant get enough. It worked an Ok Computer is one of these rare albums released. A gutsy effort with beautiful tunes and amazing vocals and performance  by Tom York and the boys. A Classic album.
B00000I8BX|3.0|After the classic that was &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, Fear Factory returned with &quot;Obsolete&quot;, which went on to become the band's most overrated album.  Not to mention that not long after the release of &quot;Obsolete&quot;, nu-metal began to go on the rise, and while many saw the band as a trend, &quot;Obsolete&quot; managed to go gold.  One thing about Fear Factory is that the band was never a trend, and any true fan of the band knows that.  The people who just jumped on the bandwagon while listening to albums like &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; and &quot;Three Dollar Bill Y'all&quot; didn't know a thing about anything called &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; or &quot;Demanufacture&quot;, and that in itself is a shame.  Anyway, all that aside, &quot;Obsolete&quot; is overrated and definitely not the band's most inspired effort.  Songs like &quot;Shock&quot; and &quot;Resurrection&quot; are the usual FF fare, but the title track, the cover of &quot;Cars&quot; and most of the bonus tracks included here are nothing special, and offer nothing in terms of the band member's excellent talents.  All in all, &quot;Obsolete&quot; isn't a bad album, but if you want to listen to somethig great and meaningful by Fear Factory then check out the previously mentioned &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot; and the all time classic &quot;Demanufacture&quot;.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith first release is a triumph for woman in music. It is angry, sad, beautiful and poetic. Patti voice isn´t beautiful nor is it supposed to be. It is angry and sometimes annoying. She sometimes screams and doesn´t hold back some of her anger and lets it all out. The compositions are amazing. The first song Gloria is amazing track, partly covered originally by Van Morrison and she sure does a justice to that song. Other notable tracks such as the 9 minute long Birdland, The uplifting redondo beach, the haunting Free Money, the fun yet provocative Kimberly among others. Her band are amazing performers and they now what to do. The producer John Cale doesn´t go extreme with production but does not make a soddy effort. <br />Horses is often reffered as a punk album. I Can not put it into one genre. It is a bit of new wave, punk, rock but overall a fantastic album that doesn´t need a time to be categorized but to be respected and loved by those who experience it and really like it. A Classic debut album by an amazing artist. 5 stars.
6300214354|3.0|I thought this was a very funny movie.  It had a lot of great sight gags.  I just don't like the way they make East Germany look.  The East Germany in this movie resembles Nazi Germany which is unfair because the East Germans had a strong anti Nazi line.
B000000WJZ|5.0|To be deserving of 5-stars, in my mind, an album must be listenable all the way through without any desire to forward through it whatsoever.<BR>To earn the status of &quot;classic&quot; (also by my own definition) one must be able to listen through the album over a period of several years without tiring of it. <br />Both of the above are applicable to Siamese Dream. I first heard it almost 10 years ago and have owed the CD for 8 years - still I am not bored of it in the least. This is one of the greatest discs ever pressed and few people with ears can deny this truth.
B00008OLIC|5.0|Now Motley Crue put out a lot of great albums, but Dr. Feelgood was by far their best effort.  First of all the songs are classics.  With &quot;Sticky Sweet&quot;, &quot;Kickstart My Heart&quot;, and of course the title track &quot;Dr. Feelgood,&quot; it just does great much more memorable than that.  Secondly, the production quality is utterly amazing.  Bob Rock and the Crue really knew what they were doing with this album.  Tommy and Nikki never worked so well together, and if anyone ever had any doubts about Mick's guitar playing, all they would have to do is listen to this album.  He just proves he is up with the best of them.  This CD is just great, and all of the extras is just a Crue fan's dream come true.  I recommend this to anyone that calls themselves a fan of Motley Crue.  You won't be disappointed.
B000000WHX|4.0|Massive's characteristic low haunting bass lines overlayed with heartfelt yet sleepy lyrics gave birth to an entire genre. This album is undoubtedly the influence behind many similar bands that would come later and fall under the genre of \\"trip hop\\".  ie/portishead, morcheeba, tricky (obviously!), sneaker pimps, etc.    This album is the womb of trip hop and is a joy to listen to, minus one or two dull moments. If you like any of the bands listed above you should probably consider buying this CD.
B00008H2LB|4.0|If five star reviews were not handed out like water at a rave party I may have resisted the urge to play this CD down a little.<BR>I bought both Hybrid and Meteora two days apart, and must say that the latter has dominated the time in my CD player by a ratio of ten to one. Better still I am yet to use the skip or program button that on Hybrid is dominated with 2,4 and 8. <br />Some have complained that this CD is lacking a single of the calibre of \\"In The End\\" and falls short of Hybrid for this reason. The more I listen to \\"Easier To Run\\" the more LP sound like Savage Garden, however it is this single that will carry Meteora over the line technically although the great CD bubble has well and truly burst and groups these days will be punished for releasing rubbish in the hope of surviving on reputation alone.<br />This CD is tight, well produced, inspirational, heavy, daunting, incredibly short but it is certainly catchy and should produce a handful of hits, although I can see Easier To Run threatening a top 5 spot in Australia once it is released as a single here.<br />Numb is a song Savage Garden would be proud of also.<br />In terms of the whole package this effort is all over Hybrid Theory, although how can you top an album tnat has moved 14 million copies?.
B00000295Y|5.0|This has to be one of the best cypress hill albums.First of all it is very rare type of music if you see what i mean,there are'nt that many gangsta rap groups out ther that have music like cypress hill.Cypress hill are really different,including there lyrics.This has to be an all time hip hop classic record there probably is'nt one the same.The first song on there is i wanna get high,which has a really good tune and something to sit back to.Then there is we aint going out like that which is allwright.But the best song is insane in the brain which is an all time classic,then there is clock the hammer which is just dope and crazy song u will like it.Hits from the bong is another good song,and 3 lil putos.I can name you more but those are the good ones.
B00008S2VG|5.0|NOT FOR THE AMERICANS<br />Initially it's not an easy listen.  but every time i repeat it, I discover that it sounds fantastic and definitely an album which i want to listen to again and again. I really like   Hollywood, Mother &amp; Father, Love Profusion,  I'm So Stupid, Nobody Knows Me,Nothing Fails, American Life and the incredible \\"easy ride\\"<br />The others tracks are good too, but they' re need more time.<br />i really enjoy to listenig with my walkman cd while i walk or in bed. this cd have a lot of nice sounds and a beatiful musicalization. After listenig i feel in peace. I love it.<br />   but i think it's not going to be commercial.<br />         THIS IS NOT A DANCE CD or R&amp;B CD
B00008OLYN|5.0|I can hear the deafening chants of \\"Sell Out!\\" already. Those metal purists who believe that their beloved favourite band should never change....but yet then complain that their \\"new\\" album sounds like the \\"last\\" one.  For true Opeth fans, this concept was expected.  No, there are no death metal growls or thrash guitars....actually a distorted guitar scarcely makes an appearence, except for a few solos and a power chord hit. This album is beautiful from begining to end.  One could compare this to previous \\"mellow\\" efforts like \\"Harvest\\" or \\"Benighted\\", but that is where it should end.  These compositions are much more varied and experimental than those songs. They are darker and more sinister.  Mikael's voice is absolutely stunning....its hard to believe that this is same vocalist that belts out death agression on Deliverance (another amazing piece of work!) While this album may not be \\"metal\\"....neither are Opeth.  For those willing to take the time and listen with an open mind, will find a trully breath taking acoustic album. Rock on!
0385504209|3.0|I agree that the DaVinci code is a fun thriller that is hard to put down.  I was so intrigued by the review (especially a positive comparison to Katherine Neville's \\"The Eight\\"--one of my favorite books which I am now re-reading) that I decided to read \\"Angels and Demons\\" first.  That was probably a mistake, since many of the plot elements in DaVinci code mirror those in his earlier book.  \\"The DaVinci Code\\" is a much better book than \\"Angels and Demons\\",but I was able to guess things about what was going to happen based on my reading of the previous book.  This only could occur because of the very strong reliance on the same plot elements from the very first scene with the hero getting a nocturnal call to immediatly view a dead body mired in symbolism, his meeting a young women who turns out to be related to the murder victim (grandaughter, vs adopted daughter) and so on.  I don't want to mention any others since they might give away the plot.
B00008S2VG|1.0|I have been a Madonna fan since she first came out and I own every album. I'm sorry to say that Music was disappointing and American Life is even worse.<br />I really feel that she is just throwing whatever stuff... she can into albums without really putting any time or effort into them. I guess she doesn't have to anymore.<br />I can honestly say that I will never buy another album of hers again. She has really become a has-been and needs to move out and leave it to the fresh & young talent.
B00005B3Z6|5.0|As a fan of the Showtime series I was curious as to how the British (and original) series fared. I happened upon a copy @ Borders, bought and loved it! I find the Brit version superior to the US version because the characters are so much more likeable (sp ??) and not so whiney. My only complaint is that the UK version is so short.
B000000993|5.0|Tool's first full length LP, Undertow hits us with a hard and unpredictable, very solid album. Following their first release, Opiate, which was very lyrical in its nature, Undertow shows us the maturing side of Tool that is getting more into the instrumental and \\"musical\\" part of the spectrum. Undertow is the favorite CD of many Tool fans simply because its so raw and true to their sound, and I may agree with this... but let's break it down.<br />\\"Interolance\\" is the opening track, with 4 minutes of pure hard rock and unique lyrics. \\"You lie, cheat, and steal... you lie, cheat, and steal.\\" is the repeating chorus which immediately gets into your head. Following that song is an even better song and one of my favorites on the CD. \\"Prison Sex\\" instantly comes off with some awesome guitar riffs and has some interesting lyrics that are sure to make you think. After Prison, comes \\"Sober\\" which is basically their single for the album. This one of the songs they made a video for, and it definitely deserves it. Rock at its finest with, \\"Why can't we not be sober? I just want to start this over...\\". At this point we are seeing a little longer songs and more instrumental: \\"Bottom\\" hits us with a long medium paced song that most Tool fans go crazy over. Good cut... Then track 5, \\"Crawl Away\\" is a bit harder but an overall good song.<br />The second half of the CD is longer, and some consider that parts of it may be filler material. I still think it's quality rock though. Track 6 is \\"Swamp Song\\", and I love the lyrics in this one. \\"I hope it sucks you down, Fu****!\\". The title track, \\"Undertow\\" is next, and it's pretty worthy of this title although not my favorite on the album. It goes from hard to somewhat-soft parts, and overall is good. But the biggest hit on this portion of the cd is the next track, \\"4*\\". 4 Degrees is simply awesome. With an egyptian-type guitar riff at the beginning, this song kicks you into gear with some amazing instrumental work as a whole. The lyrics are flawless by Maynard and I won't ever stop listening to this one. \\"Flood\\" follows, and is a step in a really different direction. It weighs in at almost 8 minutes and for the first half of the song is nothing but instrumental. Maynard's great vocals come into play during the 2nd half and this is where it really heats up. Good song. The final track, \\"Disgustipated\\", is a solid 15 mins and 47 seconds and it's very psychedelic and spaced out in nature. It stops at about 4:20 and there is about 10 mins of nothing, then a man starts talking softly, pretty creepy sounding.<br />Overall this CD is pretty flawless. I think it's probably the most unique sounding of the Tool CD's, as it is unpredictable and erratic in nature. I would definitely say this album is a giant leap ahead of Opiate in terms of overall production and theme. Most Tool fans swear by this CD just as much as the others, so if you're looking for a good hard rock album, pick up Undertow.<br />Overall Rating: 9.6 / 10e flawless by Maynard and I won't ever stop listening to this one. \\"Flood\\" follows, and is a step in a really different direction.

B00003CXXP|1.0|This is definitely being added to the top 10 Worst movies I have ever seen. There is nothing original about the entire story. It is a hodge-podge of plagiarism drawing from numerous sci-fi and fairy tales. To name a few: Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, Robot Dreams, What makes this terribly bad is that these sources don't even seem to be disguised at all. It is like there is a blatant reference to all the original stories.<br />The characters are extremely un-captivating, which leaves you with sense of not identifying with nor caring about their plight. But wait, it gets worse the lighting throughout the film is terrible. What should be lit isnt and what should be dark is lit. It seems like the back ground was more important that the actors. I guess it was to draw the viewers attention away from the thin story line. I found myself just wanting the main character, David, just to die, or better yet rust away.<br />Do yourself a favor, and save your money for something else.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I was really suprised at the number of negative (maybe not strong enough of a word?) reviews this movie got!  I thought it was FABULOUS!  You get to see popular actors and actresses in a whole new light as they showcase their vocal and dance talents, the music is superb, the story is classic . . .  It IS a musical, so if you don't like music in your movies, this isn't for you . . . but that doesn't make the movie bad! I'm happy to see film makers doing some unique and different movies, such as Chicago.  Its not your average run-of-the-mill film.<br />Its a very sexy, sassy musical revisited on film and is in every way a real treat to watch!
B00008S2VG|3.0|Well it's not Madonna's best work....so far the songs all sound very much the same..with a simple guitar and then added &quot;techno&quot; sounds and effects...I do like some of the songs, like &quot;hollywood&quot; and &quot;easy ride&quot;..it's just kind of boring and blah...i do like some of her messages in it, but I find it hard to believe &quot;madonna&quot; really believes what she is singing..not worth it to buy it..american life is prob the best song, with one or two others that are alright
B00008S2VG|5.0|Maybe not a huge comercially success like her previous albums, but this is her master piece album,it's like a resume of her 20 years of career. All songs in this album are great but the best are Mother and Father, Nothing Fails, Love Profusion and Hollywood. Don't doubt it and buy American Life, you'll love it.
0380002930|5.0|This is truly amazing.Nobody who writes animal fantasy has ever equaled this .It is amazingly in depth,it includes detail on the language of the rabbits,the culture ,and the tails.The characters are well done (not at all flat)and it is very exciting.It's partly that I'm a Rabbit -Attic that I loved this so much,but than it would have been just as good if it were a different animal that he'd done it on.<BR> Hazel and his brother Fiver gather a hardy band of rabbits to leave the warren ,for Fiver senses trouble.Fiver predicted a flood that happened,so Hazel trusts him.Then it takes off from there.Eventually ,it turns into a (sort of)war between there new warren ,Watership Down,and a mysterious warren nearby called Efrafa.<BR>Now you must be warned that this book is extremely disturbing at some parts.It was so disturbing at one part that I had to put down the book and recover for a couple minutes.Be warned.
B00008O0WN|5.0|This was a good movie. I don't know why people didn't like it. The actors worked hard on making this movie just to entertain fellow trekkers. I for sure am buying the movie to show support for Star Trek. This DVD is worth buying in my opinion. Buy the movie and take a look at the special features after watching the movie. I think they'll be worth taking a look.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie was ten times better than the first one and ten times better than the book version. When I read the chamber of secrets it wasn't my favorite of the Harry Potter serise. Although the book could have used some help the movie was almost flawless and apeasing to the readers. It has alot of the information that was in the book and really only left out a few minor things. This movie shows a more mature realationship with the kids that isn't really shown til the fourth book. Although risky it was definatly a good idea. It has people asking, I wonder what is going to happen between Harry and Hermione next? <BR>     My favorite of the books is the third one and I was a bit sceptical about them makeing it into a movie because I was afraid it might ruin it. But after seeing the second movie I have no doubts that the third movie will be wonderful.
B00003CXI1|1.0|Remember when villains needed a reason to be bad.  When I was young, childrens films carried values with them.  Not only does the film \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" not let viewers know why the villains are evil (see Boo Radley), but it also finds a way to make the heroes take their place.  Now I know your saying to yourself, \\"Hey Alex, it made sense in the book.\\"  I know, but this is the movie.  Look at \\"Lord Of The Rings\\"!  For gosh sakes, look at Ramona the TV series!  The last scene in HP1 is the most terrible thing I've ever seen in childrens cinema.  For no reason at all, the school takes an award away from the \\"bad guys\\" and gives it to the \\"good guys\\".  Of course, everyone rejoices in the film, but are we really trying to teach our children these values?  What happened to being humble?  What happened to likable heroes?  How come video games have better special effects than this big budget movie?  These are all questions you should ponder after the viewing of this truly dreadful film.
B00008OLYN|5.0|First off, for those of you who are new to Opeth, you need to know that this is the second half of their Deliverance/Damnation &quot;experiment&quot;; the former being the &quot;heavy&quot; album and more like their previous works, and the latter being the &quot;mellow&quot; album, a rather daring experiment, but one that I feel has paid off.<BR>I hadn't heard a single song off this album until I actually bought the album (other than a little sample they played at the end of the gig I went to), so I wasn't exactly sure what to expect. After having listened to this album over and over since the day I bought it, I can say they pulled it off perfectly. At the moment, I feel &quot;Damnation&quot; may actually be the better half of the experiment (although &quot;Deliverance&quot; is a great album, too).<br />The standout song from this album has to be &quot;In My Time Of Need&quot;. The best way I can describe this song is as one filled with haunting emotion (and a fantastic chorus) that immediately strikes to the core of your soul, and will keep you reaching for the repeat button over and over again. Another top song from this album is &quot;Hope Leaves&quot; - with its lonely, deserted feel - it is soothing, yet sad. The instrumental track on this album, &quot;Ending Credits&quot;, is a nice interlude - and quite possibly the most uplifting song on the album (that I can't help but feel Carlos Santana would be proud of if he himself had written it) - leading to the final haunting song on the album.<br />While this album may be mellow, it is quite heavy and dark in emotion. This is a great album that any fan of good music will truly enjoy, even if the heavier aspects of Opeth's past works may be a little too heavy for them. And for the long-time fans of Opeth, this is just another great work from this multi-dimensional band to add to their collection, and quite possibly one of the best.
B000069AUI|1.0|I bought this CD based on the song, 'Clocks', which is playing a lot on the radio.  Unfortunately, the CD is boring.  The rhythms are neat and pleasant to hear, but the words that go along with them are confusing and rarely make sense.  It feels like a lot of navel gazing going on here.
B0000025JT|5.0|She needs to produce more albums like this.  Pure pop pleasure!  Most of her recent albums have been so drab and unlistenable.  Please, Barbra, return to making these great pop-oriented albums!  Don't waste your beautiful voice and unique talent on the nondescript music that you've been recording lately.  I miss the old Barbara!  I hope she returns very soon.
0380002930|5.0|Watership Down is one of the most engaging books I've ever read. It's a classic, uplifting book and I recommend it to readers of all ages. The character development was wonderful.  There are some tense moments to be sure.  I came to care deeply for the rabbits and was moved each time they pulled together to get through their challenges as they continued to move toward Fiver's vision of their future.  I cried at the end, not because it was sad, but because the book was over.<BR>It was all about survival, leadership, striking out on your own, operating as a member of a group to ensure success, overcoming difficulties through sheer grit and determination, and creative thinking in a crisis.... I could go on.<BR>I have read this book only a year after my first reading, and will read it again.  I had no trouble with rabbits as the protagonists.
B00008DDXC|4.0|On this DVD you don't have to go through a long, drawn-out process to get to the deleted scenes.  Now there is a place to click and go directly there.  The special features are easy to get to unlike the first Harry Potter DVD.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This is by far one of the top albums of the year, and it deserved all 5 stars it earned in Rolling Stones. Forget all of the hype about Jack and Meg, and just buy it. Elephant is phenomenal by any standards, but the fact that it was made in ten days, without any computers, shows you exactly how talented these two are. I have been a fan of The White Stripes for some time now, but this album blows all of their earlier stuff away. The guitar solos, and bass-like sound of Jacks guitar make it even more impressive. Enough, buy it.
0812550706|5.0|This is an absolutely wonderful work of science fiction. I bought Ender's Game and the rest of the Ender Quartet, without knowing what they were about, but I was pleasantly surprised. Orson Scott Card is a master of weaving tales of intrigue and of creating truly deep and interesting characters that you grow to love. Never have I encountered better character development than in Card's work.<br />Ender's Game is a terrific book, but I ended up wanting so much more. I felt like I wanted this book to be twice as long, and it seemed to end way too quickly for me. It also seemed to be a little more character focused than the other books, which can be good or bad. Overall, a superb book. The whole series is a must-read for anyone with any interest in science-fiction.
B00006LJ72|5.0|I could probably only be happier with this set if it came autographed.  Her artistry and range never fail to amaze me.  My only quibble (and a quibble it really is) is that I would have included Pilgrim instead of Lazy Days.  Other than that, I can't imagine loving it more than I do.<br />Do you have a six-star category?
B00008DDXB|3.0|It was better than the first, but is still not quite there. Maybe the third time will be the charm and achieve movie greatness.
0671570439|5.0|Carl Sagan was a wonder and this abridged audio version of Contact is the only version I've ever gone through.  I saw the film, but never read any of his other books.  I've since ordered them all.  Amazing.<br />Wow.  I literally didn't want to get out of my car.  As good as Jodie Foster was in the film, her audio read was remarkable.  She really is as good as they get on screen and in my car stereo.  Her talent was to convey the wonder of the book and make me care about the issues and she really delivers.<br />If you are thinking about buying this, you won't regret it.  The only regret you may feel is that Carl is now gone and there won't be any more of his wonderfully educating stories.
B00008S2VG|3.0|I'm still scratching my head while listening to Madonna's 'Life. Is this pleasure? Do we suddenly need to learn? What's the message of this genius then? Is it a sophisticated effort to let us finally look into her soul? Well, I try, but my own efforts are being distracted by the mighty producer and irritating overkill of noises. Melodies don't get a chance to evolve, so maybe she should bring the strings back into the next real scheme of reflections.
0688163173|5.0|Teddy and Chuck...Shutter Island...psychiatrists...<br />Dennis Lehane...you rock!  That's all I'm going to say<br />right now.
B00005JM1D|4.0|This was one of the better comedies to come out earlier this year. I enjoyed it alot! Will Farrell was great in his role. I laughed so hard...The only problem that I had with it was that a few parts seemed to drag a bit. That is my only criticism. If you wanna laugh, go see this one. You won't be disappointed. <br />*Andy Dick has a HILARIOUS cameo!*
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I really enjoied listening to this.The song &quot;peacekeeper&quot; is my favorite by far.In my opinion it really sounds great.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Overall an album I can listen to all the way thru, and in this day &amp; age that's a rare gem!!  Each song is excellant by itself, but even as a whole the entire album really gels together and presents an entire package of what Madonna is trying to convey to her listener.  It's about transformation, abandonment of everyone else's ideals, love - for others &amp; yourself, and the realization that we are all better off being just ourselves - and sometimes it may take 1/2 our life to find out who that is.  It's at least taken her some 40 odd years....Standout tracks are Love Profusion, Nobody Knows Me, and Mother &amp; Father.  Easy Ride is the perfect ending to a perfect album.  I recommend it highly and suspect any fan of Madonna will buy - however, the album is accessible to any person on a human level. Just not everyone is ready....
B000068PQ0|5.0|I have to admit that I only initially heard of the Flaming Lips because of Steve Burns from Blue's Clues, but I have since become intrigued by their music.<br />  Although there are a variety of categories they could be placed in, their music truly does defy description.  The album may not be for everyone, but after listening to it a couple of times, I was hooked.<br />  Their website does have a free media player which allows you to listen to the CD in its entirety instead of 30-second tidbits.  The only true way to appreciate the album is to listen to it a couple of times.  It is also beneficial to read the lyrics and Wayne's notes on the album.  Most of the songs are quite unique and enchanting and much of the album was put together with a story in mind, so it is a much more interesting album than most.<br />  \\"Another Robot/Sympathy 3000-21\\" is about the moral question of whether emotions felt by robots could be considered genuine and \\"All We Have is Now\\" is about a man that meets his future self who has come back to tell him how he is going to die.<br />  Incredibly interesting and very creative.  The music, lyrics and video are genius of their genre and they deserve a chance to be heard.<br />  Definitely on of my favorites!  :)
B00008I8IF|4.0|After two very disappointing and weak albums in form of &quot;Sound of lies&quot; 1997 and &quot;Smile&quot; 2000, it seemed that departure of Mark Olson left Jayhawks in the musical land of mediocrity. But the band have returned with their strongest album since &quot;Hollywood town hall&quot; from 1992. <br />&quot;Rainy day music&quot; is certainly an album similar to the early musical direction with a fair amount of country. This is alternative country/americana of highest quality, equally great as Whiskeytown's finest moments. As &quot;Stumbling through the dark&quot; begins, it's clear that Jayhawks finally have gotten back to their roots. This release is full of catchy and melodic tunes with beautiful vocal harmonies and arrangements. Just listen to &quot;Tailspin&quot;, &quot;Save it for a rainy day&quot;, &quot;Angelyne&quot; and &quot;Will I see you in heaven&quot; among others, and you'll discover that Jayhawks might have released the album of the year.<br />I just hope this album get the recognition it deserves!
B000069AUI|2.0|This is the first colplay album I've listened to and probably the last. The album starts of OK then drops until the end where it picks up slightly. The songs all chug along using the same keyboard progressions and  slow pace throughout. There is very little variation and while the production is good, overall musicianship is poor. <br />Coldplay might be pleasant enough for those nights when you simply want to nod off. Indeed there are some nice melodies at times but overall this is a very pedestrian and uninspired effort.
B000056K04|5.0|It's apparent that a lot of people are afraid of change, even when its for the better. This album is amazing, the band can't keep making the same mellow song over and over, so Everyday was brilliant.Maybe you're sore about how it was produced, but get over it. Try comparing the diversity of these tracks to any other artists out there today, it's impossible. Here's the truth about the tracks...<BR>I Did It(7.5/10)- So, it doesn't hold the meaning of classic DMB, but it's a guilty pleasure to the ear every so often.<BR>When the World Ends(9/10)- You have something up your backside if you can't appreciate this song during a night out on the town. &quot;We'll be burning one&quot;, come on, thats DMB's symbol.<BR>The Space Between(10/10)- It may have scared some away due to it's success with the Pop genre, but it's a beautiful song none-the-less.<BR>Dreams of Our Fathers(8/10)- Has a smooth flow, nothing to pass by. <BR>So Right(10/10)- This can be taped along side of &quot;What You Are&quot;, but they're both very uplifting rhythmically, great songs.<BR>If I Had It All(10/10)- This song has Dave singing at our &quot;level&quot; in the game. It had a great composition, and tricky lyrics.<BR>What You Are(10/10)- Most original song on the album. It's also the greatest encore song they play at their concerts.<BR>Angel(10/10)- I'm partial to this song, I've listened to it probably... too much! It's a beautiful, &quot;craving for love&quot; song. The beginning chords should catch you.<BR>Fool To Think(10/10)- I group this song with &quot;If I had it All.&quot; It's a fun song about flirtation...maybe that's why some of you can't adapt.<BR>Sleep to Dream Her(9/10)- Has that eerie Dave vibe to it. Mellow compared to the other tracks.<BR>Mother Father(7/10)-I don't really listen to this track, so I can't say much more than that.<BR>Everyday(7/10)- It's a pop song, I will admit.
0553573403|5.0|Talk about your never-ending stories.  Having read the first three books, at over 700 pages apiece, I can say I haven't had as good a fantasy trip in a long while.  The characters are human, sometimes depressingly so, the sub-plots are vicious and complex, and the plot is a twisty-turvy thing that never quite goes where you think it will.  Don't get too attached to a character, they die with amazing regularity.  I was amazed by their depth of development only to see them get hacked down five pages later.  Always entertaining and hard to put down.
0156027321|5.0|It's hard to write a short review of this book since it is complex and really unique. So many things happen that you will want to talk about this tale as it unfolds and discuss it after you finish.<BR>An author's note sets up the tale and we are told how Martel came to hear of a story \\"that will make you believe in God\\"  But this is not a religious story. It is a tale of a fascinating 16 year old boy, his life in India growing up in the environs of a small zoo, and what he learns there of animals and life.<BR>When his father decides to move to Canada, the animals are packed up and they and the family board a steamer for the trip. As the ship sinks in the Indian Ocean, only a few survivors make it to a life raft.   And there the fascinating tale begins in earnest.<br />What is so compelling about this story--is it the personality of Pi, the Indian boy? Or the story of survival in the lifeboat for so many months? Or is it how he conquered his fears and lived day to day despite the terrors he experienced including living with a tiger in a small boat?  It is all of it plus some gruesome events that Pi had to endure to stay alive and his philosophy that kept him going.<br />As I read this book, I discussed the events as they happened with my husband (you won't believe what just happened...) When the story finally came to an end in a very surprising way, I really wanted to discuss how it all happened.<br />If you can suspend belief and jump with both feet into this story, and you don't mind a few gruesome scenes along the way, you are in for a delightful treat. Highly recommended.
B0000214G6|3.0|instead of a flashy Hollywood style film.  Excellent photography of NYC, and the rain filled scenes are wonderful to look at and reflect on. The music is all 80's, of course, the film was shot in '85.  But the music still holds up today and flows with the erotic scenes as well as all the scenes.  The movie may look like it promises sexual fireworks, depending on what you're looking for, and this may be why many critics wrote it off as being a big tease.  But, there's other aspecs to focus on here: Rourke, an excellent actor, shines as an obsessive, secretive, sexual wacko with no rhyme or reason for his behavior. And Basinger may come across as a dumb blonde, but she played a very gutsy role.  In fact, there's not much of a story here, but you know what?  I don't think the producers, etc. intended there to be.  Maybe it's what the critics claimed it to be: A tease.  Maybe the joke's on us? I give it *** stars.  Very surreal atmosphere, and brave performances by the two stars make this a film that will stand the test of time.
0452282152|5.0|I have been intrigued by Vermeer's works, particulary his attention to detail and &quot;picture within a picture&quot;. While little is known of his life, Chevalier weaves a fascinating tale told by Griet, a 17 year old girl pressed into service as a maid for the Vermeer family to aid Griet's starving family. Through Griet's eyes we see what daily life might have been like in 17th century Holland. What is particularly fascinating is the exposition of how Vermeer painted--his vision, his treatment of colors and his use of a new instrument to get a different perspective on his subjects.<br />  Griet is a very appealing heroine. We identify with her fears in leaving home and living in a &quot;Papist&quot; house; her sorrows from the woes of her family, and her curiosity and intelligence when she is asked to help the artist. As is obvious from the title, Griet also serves as the model for one of Vermeer's most haunting masterpieces.   All of these elements add to the pleasure of this book. I was totally engrossed with this story and finished reading it in one day.
B000001EAQ|2.0|I remember in 1995 when I got hooked on U2. I went to Dublin to see all the places where the boys in U2 grew up in. And Windmill Lane. It was a nice time and I highly recommend going to Dublin, just generally. Its a great city. Anyway, thats not what I should write about here. Well, after all the wait for a new studio-album we got PoP. Zooropa came out in 1993 so it was a time for a new album. When hearing the first single off the album, Discothque, I got worried. Its a song I cant hear more than once a year. There are only two songs I like on the album, Staring at the Sun and Wake Up Dead Man.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|.... this album is not the best album ever to be released and no it does not match up when compared to rumours. come on people rumours is one of the best albums of all time and how can any song anywhere come close to stevies \\"dreams\\". so firstly lets stop comparing to rumours, lets not be pedantic about having too many songs no christine mcvie and simply enjoy this cd for what it is. Appreciate that this band could have simply retired and gone into hiding somewhere never to be seen. arent we all lucky to have such fine artists entertaining us again , this would have only been a dream a few years back. Stevie nicks will always be timeless.<BR>if you have opinions about the quality of this album ie the songs, the music style well to each his own i guess. all i can say is this is a better alternative to some other music going around today.
0805066691|5.0|I realize now, after just finishing this book, how absolutely ignorant I was before it. It was painful to read, and it took me a while, but the information contained in it is something every American needs to know.  This should be required reading in our schools.

Harper's insistence on trying to do at least five different types of music made Burn to Shine a solid and fairly interesting album, but it's bitten him in the ... here.  The music is great on a technical level, but the lyrics are inane, his forrays into metal are embarrassing, and worst of all, nearly every song could be dropped into a slot with a category on it.  You've got the Reggae Song, the Mississippi Delta Blues song (\\"When it's Good\\"--which is actually the best on the album), the James Brown Funk Song, the George Clinton Funk Song, etc.<br />Fight for Your Mind is great, I've heard good things about Welcome to the Cruel World, I love Burn to Shine, and Live From Mars is absolutely incredible, but this album isn't worth the money.  Every great artisit deserves to get away with eating it on one studio album, and I hope Harper can find his mojo again after putting out this thing.  He needs to be recognized as the great songwriter and performer he is, but putting out something this derivative and forced isn't going to get him there.
B000009EAD|5.0|JUST MASTERPIECE, how can you put a price on something like this!! Im glad i bought it cheap though, but this album is just melodic with the guitars, voice, and deep drum beats, MAN, ALL SONGS ROCK!!! A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I expected this to be a pretty good album, but I was very pleased with the final result.  At 18 tracks, there's a little of everything here.  There are many songs here I especially like and some lesser ones too.<br />The individual songs are pretty different in style, and the album has high playback appeal.  This is a great CD that I will be listening to for a while.<br />Fleetwood Mac - back and sounding great with 18 tracks...<BR>What more could you want?
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Released on April 8th, 2003, Faceless the latest effort of the Boston based Rock band Godsmack, is surely one of the greatest albums of the year. Through early albums Sully Erna, Lead Singer/Guitar, has progressed in his vocal talent for arguably the best vocals of the year on this album. Inspired by supporting heart warming Guitar riffs by Tony Rambola, Ernas' style proves to be Breathe taking and catchy as Faceless debuted at #1 on the billboards top 200. Honestly, its definetly worth the money and an award for album of the year.
B000068PQ0|4.0|This is when the Flaming Lips get mellow and into the Uk top of the Pops (bless them for I love them). Fight Test is a good start and Yoshimi is quite pleasant but... and, yes there is a but, this album is so mellow it makes you feel like a marshmallow. This is not Rock 'n' Roll anymore. Now! there's great lyrics, a lot of humour (e.g. \\"Are You a Hypnotist?\\",or is it just me?) and deep thoughts about the meaning of life and friendship an' all (\\"look outside...\\" \\"everyone you know some day will die...\\", etc..) And that's good! it kind of tells you to wake up and make the most of life while you can. There is still something missing though...and that's Rock 'n' Roll. Try it anyway, you might like it. Marshmallows are lovely... and the Flaming lips are great.
B00008OLYN|5.0|If you are looking to enjoy Opeth for the first time this cd is definitely not for you. Start out with Blackwater Park or Deliverance. While not being traditional Opeth (most songs are less than 6 minutes and are not very heavy) it is still very beautiful music by a very talented band. A must listen!

B00008J2DQ|5.0|This album is brilliant! I have never been disappointed by anything that Godsmack has done and this album is no exception.  Raw emotion and power.... Faceless stirs both passion and empowering liberation from within me.  All I can say is Thank you, Thank you Godsmack!!<br />This album is an absolute must have!!  See you in Denver!
B00008MNYS|4.0|This is a much more rock-influenced CD than Robbie's previous work. That said, fans of sophisticated pop will also love this CD. The first 10 songs on the album are accessible to new Robbie Williams fans, while the remaining songs fall back on his more eclectic, tongue-in-cheek, British style and might take several listens before becoming palatable. \\"Me and My Monkey\\" is the low point of the album. \\"Feel\\", \\"Sexed Up\\", and \\"Love Somebody\\" are particularly strong tracks.
B00008S2VH|2.0|There are 3 or 4 good tracks on this CD. As a longtime fan I rushed out and bought the CD immediately. I probably wouldn't be as disappointed if I didn't buy the litmited edition with the advertised extras such as the ENhanced CD which is basically just a link to the Madonna website.
0790729628|2.0|I just don't see what all the hype is about.  Granted the scenery looks cool, but you only get a few seconds glimpse at it.  The story is under developed.  This really had potential but ends up flopping.  This could have been a wonderful sci fi epic.  Instead it bored me to death. ...  Harrison Ford is still the man though.  But a [bad] ending, the lousiest end to a villan ever.  Don't listen to reviews, this movie is terrible.  Nothing in life is worse than wasted talent.
B000089RVX|5.0|I bought the disc based just on hearing Bring Me To Life.  This was one of those rare ones where I enjoyed the whole album and could not wait to hear the next song.  My comparison is Stabbing Westward with a female lead vocalist.  This is NOT Linkin Park-like.  Aside from the rap-rock of Bring... there is no other rapping on the album.  It's large, swirling, haunting, moody.
B00005LQ04|1.0|I had read so much about this movie, it was called one of  the scarriest movie of all time...please.  This was awful.  I love the Italian horror movie genre even though they are cheesy, but this movie was not at all scary.  The plot was lousy, the special effects awful.  Aviod this movie...
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is not the Madonna of the past.  American Life is her most introspective and mature work, both musically and lyrically.<br />Truely a beautiful, challenging album.
B00000A88T|2.0|Here is a classic example of excelent talent mixed with a terrible plot.  This movie is awful, don't waste your time
B00008S2VG|5.0|&quot;American life&quot; is a great mix of beautiful acoustics and electronic.  The album continues where &quot;Music&quot; left off but with a more introvert lyrical sense.  Wonderful music with beautiful melodies.  A must for every fan.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I've only had this cd for two days but it's already grown on me so much. In my mind Opeth has blessed us with another masterpiece. It is an all mellow album with no death metal growls, double bass, or heavy distorted guitars but somehow manages to still be heavy at times. There's even a couple parts that you could almost mosh to, like the riff @ 3:49 in \\"Windowpane.\\" I payed a whopping $$ for this cd but it was so worth it. Go buy it!
B00004XONN|5.0|Kid A and Amnesiac sound even better when tracks are pasted together. I wish Radiohead would have released these Kid A sessions one double album. Here is why feel they should be packaged as a double album.<br />Like Spinning Plates has musical excerpts from TreeFingers. The very beginnings of Life in a Glass House has that sonic extension of landscapes that finished out KID A and lastly, Hunting Bears has the same harmonic structure as Optimistic: same bass lines without a resolution like Optim.. Taken as a whole, Amnesiac is THE companion to KID A, though it sounds much more empty. My point is put together THEY ARE THE SAME ALBUM complementing each other in different spans of time. Radiohead would like you to believe otherwise. The average listener could've never digested this experience which is why Radiohead opted not to combine them. But I wish they would have to the masses!!!If you have an open mind, this is my interpretation to the order that would have been the double album that was not to be thanks in large part to both Johnny and Nigel...<br />CD 1 1. Everything in its Right Place 2. KID A 3.National Anthem 4. How to Disappear Completely 5. Packt like Sardines...6. Pyramid Song 7. Pulk/Pull revolving Doors 8. You and Who's Army? 9. Treefingers 10. I might Be Wrong.<br />CD 2 1. Optimisitic 2. In Limbo 3. Knives Out 4. Morning Bell/Amnesiac 5. Dollars and Cents 6. Idioteque 7. Morning Bell 8. Hunting Bears 9. Like Spinning Plates 10. Motion Picture Soundtrack 11. Life in a Glass House.<br />If you play the albums in this track order, I dought that you would still think that both albums are that different from each other. Combined, generally speaking I feel they make the musical experience more interesting. You get the more song structured material from Amnesiac (if you can call it that) and the music soundscape of KID A. <br />As a double album, it makes a wonderful 90 minute musical journey. <br />Not unlike some of the outstanding double albums released from the 70's like Genesis \\"Lamb Lies Down on Broadway\\". Haven't heard it? Then you are missing out...
B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzai continue the formula they started on \\"Music.\\"  But unlike Impressive Instant from \\"Music\\" the style of \\"American Life\\" is less refined.  If you are only interested in the singles American Life and Die Another Day, you're better off just buying the single, because the rest of the album sounds nothing like these tunes.  The only song worthy enough to be on the album is Mother & Father. I wish the rest of the album could have successfully incorporated the electronic mixture as well as this song did.  The lyrics about childhood angst match well with the beat.  My second favorite song is Hollywood, also upbeat and danceable with catchy lyrics.  I'm So Stupid, Nobody Knows Me, X-Static Process, and Easy Ride fall flat on the beat and lyrics department.  Some of these are so boring I don't know why they were put on the album.  The album is mediocre and only a true Madonna fan should buy it.
B00006G8K0|3.0|I think this is a great film and I have it on VHS. When it came out on DVD I was very excited and thought It would have a lot of extra bonus material - No such luck No commentary, no behind the scenes footage nothing that would give you a historical meaning for the making of this remake.  I was very dissappointed at the lack of the bonus material.  As a side note, in the ending of the film there is more footage when Dracula is destroyed I am supprised that was not put back in the film. Cuts were made and should have been put back when it was released on DVD.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack fans, get this album yesterday. It's been too long since we last got a taste of them!! We had a little teaser last year when the Scorpion King was released, with I Stand Alone. This now-familiar song can be found on Faceless! For those who find Voodoo to be their favorite tune from past albums, check out The Awakening with Serenity. This album definitely has an edgier sound, but not so much so that you think, &quot;Who the He** are these guys?&quot; Nope, definitely Godsmack.
B00005JM1Y|5.0|... the offspring was Johnny English. Rowan Atkinson delivers another incredibly funny performance as the secret agent who can't do anyhting right and still manages everytime to save the day. Script writers were right on target when they decided to create Johnny English resembling Atkinson's most known character: Mr. Bean. It's all there: the funny faces, the stupid situations, the babbling, the confusion. If you are aquainted with Mr. Bean, you've already seen it all, but you're going to laugh again.<br />I said there are stupid situations, but the movie is not stupid at all. Extremely well produced, with the classy kind of humor that doesn't need any swearing. Every scene contains an intelligent joke; in fact, only once I found a joke I didn't like. There are some memorable scenes that made me laugh even on my way back home.<br />Rowan Atkinson is, obviously, perfect for the character, and it was in fact written for him. He does a splendid job, but he will be forever stigmatized as a \\"Mr. Bean\\" actor, even if there were times when I could glimpse him as a more serious actor.<br />Natalie Imbruglia surprised me as the mandatory pretty girl in spy movies. She doesn't let the viewer down. John Malkovich once again as the villain, this time as the effeminate frenchman trying to accomplish a strange evil plan on england. In fact, the mere presence of Malkovich in the cast is proof of a good production. Ben Miller did a good job as well as Johnny English's sidekick.<br />\\"Johnny English\\" is a perfect movie in the genre it was purposed to be: hard-laughing, above-average-intelligence comedy. 90 minutes of fun.<br />Grade 9.0/10
B00006RU5B|4.0|Before Audioslave was a realality and just a roumour that sounded like an awsome Idea, I really didn't know how it was going to turn out. I mean think of it, the former members of one of the best rap-rock bands (rage against the machine) with the frontman of one of the best grunge bands (soundgarden). At first sounds like a capitol idea. Is it? well lets get to the review.<br />Overall, with all of this albums praise by the public and massive over play by the radio it's really noting more than an average rock album, bad? absolutely not, but nothing really speacial. Of course Chris Cornell delivers top notch vocals. But the other members, well....at times seem to be as finely tuned. For instance, Tom Morello is one heck of a guitarist, but in a majority of the albums seems not as creative as he was in rage. The drums and bass are aswell average.<br />Some of my favorited are \\"Gasoline\\" \\"I am the highway\\" a pretty dam good ballad I must say. \\"Shadow on the sun\\" and others show extreme powerhouse tunes.<br />So, in conclusion audioslave is an average rock album, solidly recorded and solid song structures. Just in some places the albums sounds alot of whats drenching the music rock market today, and at this albums expence it kind of suffered.
0156027321|2.0|This book was higly recommended in various publications, so I was looking forward to reading it.  I generally like books that are \\"different\\" (Gabriel Garcia Marquez etc.)  but this book left me cold.  I think it might be that I had recently read \\"In the Heart of the Sea: The Tragedy of the Whaleship Essex\\", which is a better (and true!) account of being lost at sea.  Except for the fantasy  element of the Tiger, this is basically the same story.  I have to agree with another reviewer that the whole segment on the island was awkwardly out of place.  The book simply did not live up to the hype.
B00008S2VF|4.0|Okay so I have to admit it, I have always been a really big Madonna fan, ever since the 80's.  So finally after 3 years absent she is back.  And although I loved Ray of Light, and found Music mediocre.  I kind of like this album.  At first I really could not hack it, it seamed like she was repeating herself from her previous albums.  But being a die hard Madonna fan, I could not let my girl down.  So I forced myself to listen to this c.d. over and over again.  And all though some tracks are really unbearable such as \\"I'm so Stupid\\" which should have been titled.  \\"This Song is So Stupid.\\"   There are really some hidden gems in this collection that will grow on you, and have you humming along.  <br />Two of my favorites have to be.  \\"Nothing Fails.\\"  A nice love song, that has the faint touches of her 90's hit.  \\"Like a Prayer.\\"  The best song of this song is the Gospel chorus.    Another song I really like is.  X-Static Process, this song has won a place in my heart, as one of my favorite Madonna songs, and it took my 12 year old daughter to point it out to me.  She relates to it, as she sings it to herself infront of the mirror in the bathroom.  It always lifts her spirits.  I hope this song gets more airplay.<br />The rest of the album is, okay, not her best.  But she does have some minor highlights.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|No, it is not Rumours  but it is something different and more textured that reflects 2003, ( Rumours is 26 years old!) It's remarkable that they can still produce great stuff after all these years.<br />Lindsey buckingham is a  genius and this CD definitely has a lot of Buckingham's traits, beautiful songs, incredible guitar playing and extraordinary production. This release shows a lot of growth combined with extraordinary songwriting skills, even though these guys have been playing together for three decades this has the energy and excitement of a new band. There are 9 outstanding tracks here and the other 9 are very good.  Buy the CD, open the sunroof and enjoy your ride to work!
B00007J4SI|4.0|Michale Ponti may well have recorded too much music in his career - the romantic piano concertos series, piano works of tchaikovsky, moszkowski, brahms, liszt - and also a series of live recitals.   But this Scriabin set (and this review also accounts for the companion sonatas discs) may well be one of his most important contributions in regards to recordings.   For once, we get a complete cycle of Scriabin's piano works played by a pianist who has the necessary technique and also at an unbeatable budget price - about US$ 25 for the 7 discs!<BR>But not everything seems to work out here.   The sound is very much substandard with predominance to the upper registers producing results that become strident at times - the recordings from the early 70's call for urgent remastering.  And in regards to Ponti's intepretations, you do not get the feeling that he has all the music under his skin - a lot of extrardinary sight-reading seems to be going on and some inaccuracies are sadly exposed.   <BR>Yet, Ponti manages to create an improvisatory style that is very much in tune with the composer's style - and at his best, Scriabin's experimental nature finds a worthy medium in these recordings.  Also, he commands all the bravura and cantabile effects of this music seemingly at will.<BR>All in all, we must be happy this project has been released on cd (despite its flaws).   You will find better interpretations of many of these works by ogdon, hamelin, horowitz, richter, etc - but as a group and an addition to any collector's library this is a great set.
6300189821|1.0|Simply put, this is a terrible terrible movie, stupid beyond words.  I had to sit through this in the theatre, and would have walked out if I hadn't been with a group.  I really resent that this movie robbed me of about 2 hours of life that I can never get back.<br />Idiotic premise, acting that can charitably be described as \\"disengaged,\\" and characters that range from annoying to downright offensive (how Meshach can look at himself in the mirror is beyond me).  What's not to hate?  I have heard that \\"Mannequin 2\\" was even worse.  God help us all if that is in fact true.<br />You could not pay me enough to watch this movie again.  I wouldn't even want a copy of this movie in my home.  If I could burn every copy of this movie on the planet and expunge it from our collective memory, I would happily do it.  Anybody who pays money for this movie needs professional help, in my opinion.
B000001FS6|5.0|If you love U2, rip this CD.  The get enough money from concerts anyways
630441403X|5.0|God this was a depressing movie.  I am no fan of fluffy feel-good movies, but this was almost too much for me to endure at times.  One horrible occurence follows another, but the viewer is not rewarded with any sort of redemption at movie's end.  One is left feeling drained and shattered.<br />And yet it is a strangely compelling story of unconditional love on its most stark and grim terms.  Ben tells Sera that she must not try to stop him from drinking; she loves him enough to allow him to pursue, without interference, his goal of self-destruction.<br />In a perverse way, I had to admire the single-mindedness with which Ben pursues his goal of drinking himself to death.  This is not a particularly easy thing to do, but he sticks with it.  I wish I could pursue my own goals with such conviction.<br />I am glad I watched this movie, but I don't know if I could bear to watch it again.  One viewing will be enough for the movie to stick with you for all time.

0140177396|5.0|Of Mice & Men by John Steinbeck, is a novel that takes place in Soledad,California, during the 1930's which is also during the 20th century. It allso won the Nobel Prize of Literature in 1962. The story is based on migrant workers during the Great Depression & allso shows us what true friendship is about, for ex.: Lennie & Geogre. Geogre was \\"short & quick, dark of face with restless eyes & sharp. He was small but with strong hands, slender arms, a thin & bony nose.\\" Lennie is the opposite of Geogre because his \\"A huge man, shapeless of face, with large pale eyes, with wide sloping shoulders, & he walked heavily.\\" He also has mental problems.<BR>Although Lennie  has special needs George doesn't leave his side because he has a good heart & he is loyal to Lennie. But, there's times that Geogre feels that he wants to punish, struggle or even kill him because of the things he does.<BR>Also, the workers aren't so please with Lennie. What limit do you Geogre might have with Lennie? <BR>I truly recommend this book to anyone but especially those who doesn't know the definition of friendship. In this Great novel I learned that a friend isn't only there for you when you're you want to have fun but, a friend is when he/she is there for you in you're up's & down's. <BR>I rate this book with 5 stars.
B00005JLO2|4.0|I think it would be a mistake to think of this movie entirely in the context of western imperialism.  It would also be a mistake to view this as a period-piece romance.  Very little in the film is attributed to the \\"romantic\\" side of the relationship between Heath's and Kate's characters.  The film above all is about one young man's struggle to overcome his demons and learns what loyalty, courage and honor truly means.  In his attempt to redeem himself from cowardice, he is taken on a journey of sacrifice, self discovery and test of character.  He has help along the way in the form of a native who proves to be an unlikely yet extremely loyal partner, thus challenging the paradigm of who is friend and foe when survival matters most.  In the end, loyalty trumps all the other themes in this film. As Wes Bentley succinctly puts it at the end of the movie \\"fighting for the man on your left and for the man on your right\\" is what the battles were truly about -- never about upholding the ideals of imperialism, not about Queen and Country, neither for glory.      This is a film worth watching, but do so without any pre-conceived notions based on reviews, summaries and eye-catching trailers.  To grasp the deeper meaning of the film, be prepared to watch with an open mind and conscience.
0385504209|1.0|If you feel strongly about your Christian beliefs, you won't like this book.  It contains a major plot point that mocks basic doctrines of Christianity, such as the authenticity of the gospel and the resurrection and diety of Jesus Christ.  I put the book down for good at the halfway mark.<br />Personal beliefs aside, I thought the book was slow.  The short chapters made the book seem fast-paced at first, but you begin to see through this trick as you find yourself wading through redundant flashbacks and unnecessary exposition.<br />I also found Robert Langdon, the lead character, way too passive for my taste.  In a story like this, I expect the lead character to be assertive, charismatic, clever, and resourceful.  Robert Langdon came across as a sleepy bookworm stuck in the backseat of a chase scene.<br />The puzzles in the book were a creative idea, but when the riddle of the Holy Grail was &quot;revealed,&quot; I lost interest in the book altogether.  Maybe I'll find a more appealing and less offensive mystery on my next trip to the bookstore.

B00008DDXC|4.0|I thought the filmmakers, actors and crew did a wonderful job with the book. I really enjoyed everything and it totally captured my imagination.  Seeing Harry cope with a darker, more serious threat and grow more mature (and more HANDSOME, LOL!) is wonderful.  All the actors are growing into their roles.  In particular, Lucius Malfoy is a standout: malevolence personified.  <br />All in all, it was a well done movie.  Except--WHY DID they have to ruin it with such a HOKEY, RIDICULOUS ending which has very little to do with the book!  Ugh.  As soon as Hagrid enters the Great Hall, I scan forward every time.  What a disappointing conclusion.  Ugh.<br />The DVD is great, except I agree with all who said that the extra scenes should have been on Disc One, NOT Disc Two.<br />All in all, a fun viewing experience!
B000002U8A|5.0|This album rocks. Plain and simple. From the catchy &quot;New Moon on Monday&quot; to the mysterious &quot;Seventh Stranger&quot; to the original version of &quot;The Reflex&quot;, this album shows Duran Duran's style slightly more matured than the first two albums. By the time this album was released they were riding a wave of global popularity. I wish &quot;Seventh Stranger&quot; had been released as a single, but they chose to go with the more radio-friendly, upbeat songs. I also would have liked to hear &quot;Cracks in the Pavement&quot; as a single, just for the line &quot;Now I'm saying this in private/If I had a car I'd drive it (insane)&quot;!<br />This album also gets bonus points with me for the eye-candy cover photo, they were certainly looking their finest (and hottest) on this one! :) <br />This is another must-have for any fan of 80's music!
B00006DEF9|1.0|... Unfortunately, this 2-disc \\"improvement\\" is a [disappointment].  The digitally remastered sound is harsh and grungy.  Worst of all, there's a horrendous piece of censorship in Gene and Cyd's classic Broadway Melody dance number, a cut so obvious that it verges on sheer, criminal  stupidity.  I'm returning this 2-disc edition and searching for an uncut version to replace my ancient home-made VHS tape from the early 80's off a PBS station, where this dance scene is complete (and really gorgeous).  What a shame. [updated Sep 2009: OK, so I'll paste another star or two for vivid image quality, and I kept the 2-disc set because of the great extras and some priceless antique clips you won't see elsewhere. As far as I know the only uncut scene of that dance number was on the ancient VHS tape I made years and years ago. Shucks].
B000002U84|5.0|This album is superb. This is the one that made them a household name in the early 80's. These songs are still being played, and when they tour in concert they always play &quot;Rio&quot;, &quot;Save a Prayer&quot; and of course, &quot;Hungry Like the Wolf&quot;. When they toured in '01 they even attempted to play &quot;Lonely in Your Nightmare&quot; but they didn't quite make it happen... anyway this album is awesome, &quot;My Own Way&quot; is great, and so is &quot;The Chauffeur&quot;. If you only buy one DD album in your lifetime, make it this one, you won't regret it!<br />Sing Blue Silver,<br />AC
6305546789|3.0|\\"Halloween\\" accomplished a few great things-1. It payed homage to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece \\"Pyscho\\" 2. It was probably a box-office hit 3. It had some effective acting 4. It was incredibly scary 5. The score sets a perfect essence of murder and eerie scares on Halloween night. 6. There isn't a gratuitous amount of blood (not much blood at all, if I recall correctly). These are all marvelous qualities in a film. Those are some reasons I'm tempted to give this film 4 stars. But, there are some problems that make the movie less intelligent and therefore less enjoyable. One problem I had with the film was there were too many questions unanswered. For example, why does Myers wear a mask? Is it to hide some kind of hideous scar on his face? Is it because he felt he was never loved because he was unattractive? There is also no psychological reason why he killed his sister. And, the film doesn't tell us why he is so insane, what makes him tick? Why does he go on a murderous rampage on Halloween night? Why does he pick Janet Leigh's daughter to stalk? Is it because she's beautiful? Does he think he likes her? I like films where the villain is numerously almost killed, but he somehow keeps coming back for more, summoning almost superhuman strength. It's a nice touch to a horror film, but the shocks just weren't shocking enough in this film. Myers is stabbed so many times, but he keeps living. It's so predictable. If you even think Myers compares to other movie psychos like Norman Bates or Jack Torrance (\\"The Shining\\") or Annie Wilkes (\\"Misery\\") or Max Cady (\\"Cape Fear\\") or Hannibal Lecter, then you're, in my opinion, mistaken. That's just my own personal opinion though. Myers is just a crazy guy with a mask, nothing more. Because there is no real psychological detail about this madman, we can never understand why he is the way he is, what is going through his mind as he kills. All in all, a good horror film that delivers nightmarishly scary material, but in a flawed way..
B00008DDXB|5.0|I like this movie because it shows that Harry has true friends that are willing to help him no matter what danger here is. Also I like the flying care that Ron's family has. The one thing that surprizes me that he can speek to snakes in snake because of valdamort. That is one thing that stumped me. Also at the end it makes you think does Harry go back to his aunt and uncle or does he stay at Ron's house. I guess you could say that Harry would always be trapped by is aunt and uncle.
B00008S2VG|4.0|The Material Girl shows deep insight into American Culture, Lyrically this album is outstanding,Unlike most Cd's this one has a message that makes you think. Musically this album is very original and has a distinctive new sound. Madonna voice luminates over the techno/folk tracks. My favorite songs are \\"Hollywood\\" \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" \\"American Life\\" \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"Nothing Fails\\".
B000002TQB|4.0|Blur is one of those British bands that simply ooze Britishness, sort of like Ian Dury and Half Man Half Biscuit. Soundwise they are pretty mainstream Brit Rock, nothing challenging, nothing surprising, but pretty well done all told. Arena alternative for the nineties, u2 meets the Goo Goo Dolls. Pleasant in a fairly forgettable way, this is music that appeals to the mass, sounds great on the radio and is almost instantly forgettable, in fact, I've already forgotten all about them. Recommended to fans of Oasis and The Foo Fighters.
B0000648WZ|4.0|To be the grand master of science fiction, very few of Robert Heinlein's stories have made it to the big screen, and most have not stood up to the quality of Heinlein's written work.<br />Long awaited by fans, Starship Troopers did not necessarily change the trend of sub-par theatrical adaptations, but nonetheless is a fun and effects laden thrill ride worth a viewing by most fans of science fiction.<br />Starship Troopers focuses on one Juan Rico's transformation from lackluster schoolkid to citizen and soldier in one of the nastiest wars mankind has ever seen.  Rico and other characters make the jump from print to film, but the film adds relationships between them nonexistent in the book and also features many mainly minor characters in larger roles.<br />The chief bad-guys, the arachnid Bugs, are maintained from the novel and adapted with wonderful frightfulness to the screen; one wonders how these CGI wonders lost to Titanic for visual effects.  The idea of capturing a brain bug rather than simply killing mindless drones & warriors also carries over.<br />The film lacks the armored fighting suits that in many ways defined the starship troopers of the novel, a choice made both for financial and for stylistic reasons (so that the audience could see the faces of the actors rather than just a bunch of big metal suits).<br />The themes of social and political responsiblity through citicizenship and service are somewhat overborne in the film and made to appear almost fascist, a fact some Heinlein purists may find offensive.<br />Overall, the film features a lot of good special effects and some great action sequences combined with some poor school-kid antics and at times sub-par acting performances, but fans of Heinlein's book will definitely want to check out the film and keep their fingers crossed for a good adaptation of The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress and other Heinlein works in the future.
B00006F7S4|5.0|It was a cold october day in Detroit and I was standing outside the detroit opera house when all of a sudden a little man in a peacoat jumps off a tour bus- it was Beck. I ran up to him to get his signature on my sea change album cover- he signed it and said &quot;take care dude&quot;. Anyway the cd is great, most people did not like sea change because it is totally different from what Beck usually does- but if you think about it he does a lot of different stuff. BUY THIS CD- YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT!

0553212478|5.0|I have read \\"Frankenstein\\" several times. Although it has been included in the genre of horror tales it is not so much a horror story,but more a tragedy.<br />It's a story of scientist who creates an artificial being in attempt to understand the secrets of life.<br />However when he gazes upon the hideous countenance of his creation he rejects it automatically thereby avoiding total responsibility for his actions.<br />This of course brings about some negative repercussions for Dr.Frankenstein as his creation seeks revenge for his rejection.<br />Unlike the way that this creature has been portrayed in most of the movies,the creature in this book has some intellect for it had taught itself to read and speak.<br />Which is impressive as this man-made being never went to school or had a tutor to help.<br />Also this character displays a human sense of empathy when it is able to identify with some of the people in the books that it was able to read.<br />Obviously the author Mary Shelley had portrayed this creature in such a way as to gain sympathy for it from the reader.<br />Even after this creature kills the wife of Dr.Frankenstein one still feels more sympathy for his creation rather than Frankenstein himself.<br />The creator it seems is not so god-like in this novel for after he creates the hideous looking creature he abandons it and any responsibility for it.<br />One wonders seriously if this man ever thought about the consequences of his actions or whether he just did it to prove himself god-like? If so maybe his ego was more in control than his intellect. That's probably why when he saw ugly the creature was he turned away from it rather than face the fact that he had botched up his creation's appearance.<br />If he was truely dedicated to his work than he would have or should have attempted some plastic surgery to remedy the hideous appearance of his man-made being.<br />Because of it's hideous appearance the creature recieves a less than positive response from the few humans it encountered,which is why this creature became so bitter and misanthropic.<br />This more than anything makes this tale a tragedy than a horror story.<br />Rather than terrify the reader,this story appeals more to one's sense of sympathy instead,especially for the unfortunate creature who through no fault of it's own is brought into this harsh world to experience the fear and animosity of it's creator and the people that it had encountered.<br />Although written in the early part of the ninteenth century this particular story is still of current importance to our times as well,especially when we are on the brink of genetic tampering and artificial intelligence.<br />There are some among us who believe it possible to create machines that can think and maybe even feel like us.<br />Which does raise some disturbing questions of whether we should really want robots or machines to think and feel like we do.<br />After seeing the movie \\"Bladerunner\\" I seriously doubt that a race of man-made beings like the replicants should be a welcome idea or that it could be of any benefit to us when we come in conflict with such creatures.<br />If anything this novel by Mary Shelley serves as a timeless reminder of what might be the result of creating something in our image.om the few humans it encountered,which is why this creature became so bitter and misanthropic.<br />This more than anything makes this tale a tragedy than a horror story.<br />Rather than terrify the reader,this story appeals more to one's sense of sympathy instead,especially for the unfortunate creature who through no fault of it's own is brought into this harsh world to experience the fear and animosity of it's creator and the people that it had encountered.<br />Although written in the early part of the ninteenth century this particular story is still of current importance to our times as well,especially when we are on the brink of genetic tampering and artificial intelligence.<br />There are some among us who believe it possible to create machines that can think and maybe even feel like us.<br />Which does raise some disturbing questions of whether we should really want robots or machines to think and feel like we do.<br />After seeing the movie \\"Bladerunner\\" I seriously doubt that a race of man-made beings like the replicants should be a welcome idea or that it could be of any benefit to us when we come in conflict with such creatures.<br />If anything this novel by Mary Shelley serves as a timeless reminder of what might be the result of creating something in our image.
B000002H97|4.0|Metalica were kings of metal when metal was king. Even as they ascended, the seeds of metals destruction were being sown by pointless poseurs and hair bands. Metalica was the real deal, expert playing, angry roaring vocals and well, screechin anger. If metal's your thing, you have found heaven. Fans of more modern bands like Smashing Pumpkins, Stabbing Westward and even Skinny Puppy will enjoy. Especially notable is well known anthem 'Enter Sandman'
B00008S2VG|2.0|Like Erotica, this is one of Madonna's more interesting efforts, but not one that is enjoyable to hear. It feels like Madonna has lost her way, both musically and lyrically, using tired beats as a backdrop for her half-baked thoughts on materialism and spirituality. Skip this one and pick up the shockingly superior Music.
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence has decided to no longer define themselves as a Christian band.  I have no problem with secular bands. Evanescence, however, waited until after the peak of sales for their popular cd &quot;Fallen&quot; to make the announcement.  They've taken advantage of the people who were looking to support an area of music that is often overlooked.  I support them in changing their label from Christian to secular... at least they will not be seen as hypocrites... but it seems manipulative of them to have chosen the timing as they have so that they could maximize profits.  This cd is very appropriately titled &quot;Fallen&quot;.<br />(If you are looking for a nice, clean cd done by secular artists, this it great!  The songs are a bit repetetive though.  Many of them sound sort of like the same song over and over, just with different words.)
B00008S2VG|5.0|Those taken aback with the harsh first single \\"American Life\\", take heart, this is one of Madonna's gentlest and most moving albums ever.  Proppelled equally by percolating electronic blips and beeps and acoustic guitar, Madonna opens up with brutal honesty about the emptiness of stardom, the pain and loneliness of her upbringing, and the vital need for self acceptance. <BR>At times, all this honesty is a little disconcerting coming from an artist that has spent the majority of her career manipulating and shocking her way into the fabric of our culture.  But it never rings false, rather it feels like something Madonna has needed to do for a long time.  The entire album has that expulsory feel of confession....and that is what makes it so riveting.<br />American Life (4/5):  While it takes some time to grow on you, the delicious irony and honesty in this song makes it worthwhile.  That and once you actually find the beat (IT IS IN THERE) it is fabulous dancing material!<br />Hollywood (5/5):  Madonna's seething rant to Hollywood....set to bird songs and a propulsive beat.  Absoulte genius with some of the savviest voice manipulation towards the end.<br />I'm So Stupid (2/5):  The only misstep on the album.  While it fits in theme and tone, it lacks the same lyrical punch as the remainder of the album.  Also features the scariest voice manipulatiom in the begining.<br />Love Profusion (5/5):  A beautiful and heartbreaking electro ballad.  Highlighted by Madonna's strong voice and bellied by Mirwais' loving backup vocals.  Destined to be a new classic.<br />Nobody Knows Me (5/5):  A sure fire club hit!  I can't wait to hear the remixes that must certainly come at some point.  Madonna sings through the vocoder about killing your television, burning your magazines, and avoiding \\"social disease\\".<br />NOTHING FAILS (100/5):  \\"LIKE A PRAYER\\" FOR THE 21st CENTURY!  An amazing electro folk gospel hymn about the redemtive power of love.  Try and control the goosebumps when the choir comes in the last third...just try....they are inevitable. (In case all the caps and disproportioned rating did not clarify...this is my favorite song on the album!)<br />Intervention (4/5):  A sweet midtempo song in the vein of \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" or \\"Amazing\\".  Perfect for summer convertible riding.<br />X-Static Process (4/5):  Haunting vocals and no beats...just Maddy and her guitar to suprisingly effective results.  While melancholy, the message of healing is so strong it creates an uplifting and resonant mood long after listening.<br />Mother and Father (5/5):  Like \\"Oh Father\\", \\"Mer Girl\\", and \\"Paradise (Not for Me)\\", this song explores Madonna's childhood, specifically her mother's death.  Propelled by the strongest dance beat on the album, M opens up like never before and you don't know if you should cry or dance.<br />Die Another Day (4/5):  At first I thought this song's inclusion brought the whole theme of \\"American Life\\" to a screaming halt.  However, with it's \\"I Will Survive\\" theme and thick chunky electroclash beats it fits in fine.<br />Easy Ride (5/5):  The gorgeous album closer.  One can't help smirk at the irony of the last song being titled \\"Easy Ride\\" after the emotional rollercoaster of the last 10 tracks. A perfect conclusion.<br />Madonna may have really stept outside of her fans expectations and, maybe even, the general public's conciousness, but all questions as to her relevance today are shattered with this album.  Not only is she relevant, she still has some important things to say.
B00005B4GU|4.0|I started listening to Radiohead with &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; when it was originally released. I liked one song, &quot;Creep&quot;, and that was it, so when that song got old, so did my liking for the group. However, I decided, completely on a whim, to buy &quot;Amnesiac&quot; and see how the band had progressed. After all, this was some 8 or 9 years after &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, so they had to be pretty good to have lasted so long. I am SO glad I made that purchase. &quot;Amnesiac&quot; falls short of only &quot;OK Computer&quot;, the best Radiohead album out there, but nothing else. Even though the Radiohead of &quot;Amnesiac&quot; sounded totally unlike the Radiohead I had remembered, I loved what I heard, and now that I am a diehard fan, I simply say &quot;It's all good,&quot; meaning simply that the original sound of Radiohead is good as well as the new sound. This is a really great album, somewhat weird and disturbing at times, but very deep and melodic. As with most of Radiohead's albums, more than a few good listens are required to truly grasp the genious of &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. You'll be glad you picked this album up and gave it ample time.
B000069KE0|5.0|After \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" announced to the world the existence of this wonderful rock group, the question was whether the follow-up album would be as good as their debut.  The follow-up is not as good, it is better.<br />In some ways this album shows a dichotomy in musical styles.  Portions of the album are constructed as progressive rock.  Other portions are pop or rock and jazz combinations.  Some are nearly classical.  Some reviews of the album hint at this dichotomy by noting what the reviewers consider to be unlistenable portions of the album.  It is interesting to note that depending on the style of music the reviewer prefers, the portions considered unlistenable by different reviewers may be exactly opposite from each other.<br />The CD pulls together the two albums that originally made Chicago II.  Additionally, the singles versions of \\"Make Me Smile\\" and \\"24 or 6 to 4\\" are added as bonus tracks.  There are two groupings of tracks that make suites.  Tracks 6 through 12 are part of \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\", and tracks 19 through 23 make up \\"It Better End Soon\\".  There are five additional tracks leading up to the first suite, and six tracks between the two suites.<br />The five introductory tracks are blues-flavored rock.  The fourth track, \\"In the Country\\", may remind some listeners of Three Dog Night.  The other tracks in this group have the brass-flavored sound of \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\", but muted somewhat in comparison to the former album.<br />The first suite is a concept album, or side from the days of vinyl.  Out of this suite came two singles, \\"Make Me Smile\\", which peaked at #9, and \\"Colour My World\\", for which I do not have a peak chart position.  There is a lot of instrumental music in this grouping of tracks, and you can almost imagine these relatively short songs actually being one extended track, in the manner of progressive rock.<br />In the group of six songs between the two suites, several are noteworthy.  \\"Fancy Colours\\" has a blues-jazz opening, but about a minute and a half into the song it transitions to a lighter, nearly pop sounding and faster song than the opening.  The contrast is startling and makes you think the opening is a completely separate song from that after the transition.  \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" was written by Robert Lamm when he was bleary-eyed and had stayed up too late.  Knowing the origin of the song, the title nearly makes sense as you realize his brain wasn't working well when he tried to see what time it was.  The next three instrumentals seem to form a mini-suite:  \\"Prelude\\", \\"A.M. Mourning\\", and \\"P.M. Mourning\\".  Given the style of the next song, \\"Memories of Love\\", you could possibly include that with the previous four selections.  All four are mellow and heavily orchestral as opposed to rock.<br />The second suite starts off with a faster rock beat.  In the second movement a flute is prominent and though the bass and piano keep the beat moving, the instrumental has a strong jazz flavor.  The third movement has a vocal part, with a strong blues flavor and a heavy beat.  The fourth movement has a rock feel to it leading into the final song of the suite, \\"Where Do We Go from Here\\", which was released as a B-side single.<br />This album is amazing.  The musical styles include jazz, blues, neo-classical, and rock.  The combinations are broad enough and unusual enough to allow this music to be classified in a variety of genres.  However, I choose to consider this album progressive rock because of the extended length of the suites and the unusual combination of styles.  When considering the other groups considered progressive from this era, King Crimson, The Moody Blues, and Yes, it seems less of a stretch to consider this album progressive rock.<br />I have to address the one other issue brought up by some other reviewers regarding the sound of this CD.  I was unaware that the masters had been destroyed at a fire.  Regardless of what happened to the masters, this CD is an improvement over my vinyl album.  I admit that perhaps in places the ranges, particularly the lower ranges, are not as well represented as they could or should have been.  However, I would rather have this awesome work of art in its current form than not at all.  Perhaps at some time in the future we will have the technology to take the recordings we do have and perform an even more advanced digital re-mastering.  Until that time, I will enjoy this CD as it is.  5 stars for a phenomenally experimental and beautiful CD.s an improvement over my vinyl album.

B000001Y5J|5.0|Broken is my first and favorite NIN cd (though I haven't heard The Fragile in its entirity yet). I can only imagine what a shock NIN fans got in 1992 when this EP was released... instead of the tame keyboard blips and of Pretty Hate Machine, Trent decided to back up his vitrol packed lyrics with insanely earsplitting guitar riffs and screams. The fury of album cannot be understated... you'll jump the first time you are blindsided by the wall of buzzsaw guitars that make up Last and you'll jump the first time you are hit by the \\"SLAVE SCREAM!\\" of Happiness in Slavery. But thats a good thing. In some of Trents other albums (Hate Machine mostly), the animosity of the lyrics fall flat. But here, everything comes together to create a seething blast of anger and sorrow. Sure, some of the album's more ridiculous aspects may seem to trivialize the songs (the anguished voices of Happiness in Slavery are a bit over the top, and the chorus of Gave Up is pretty hilarious sounding), but all in all, these songs are just fun to listen to, and not just if you're in an angry mood. The stop/start digitally treated riffage of Wish (possibly my favorite NIN song), the industrial grind of Last (a song who's lyrics are ironic eleven years after its recording... \\"This isn't meant to last, this is for right now\\"), the swirling sounds of impending doom in Pinion and Help Me I Am In Hell, and the ever building textures of Gave Up all make for an unforgettable experience, meant to be taken in in one listen. The secret tracks aren't half bad either- \\"Physical\\", a new wave cover gone terribly loud; and \\"Suck\\", perhaps the closest thing to Pretty Hate Machine on here, are very much classic NIN songs. All in all, very worth your money, even if you are just getting into NIN (which I was when I heard this cd). If you have to get a preview, check out Wish.
B000005ILF|3.0|Among the standout tracks on this 1996 effort are the poignant \\"Hounds of Winter\\" and \\"I Hung My Head\\"; the uplifting \\"I'm So Happy I Can't Stop Crying\\", the sumptuous bossa nova of \\"La Belle Dame Sans Regrets\\", and the sweet, folky offerings \\"I Was Brought To My Senses\\", and \\"Valparaiso\\". Yet, too much of the album is burdened by filler (\\"All Four Seasons\\" veers dangerously close to ballad banality). Still, this is a solid effort that ably showcases Sting's gifts as a lyricist and composer.
B000069HK2|5.0|Take the skip buttons off your cd players because you don't need them for this CD.  If your tired of finding something good to listen to, stop looking, because I have found it.  This band is awesome, full of energy, and knows how to write music.  Their lyrics are meaningful, creative, and catchy.  They will leave you wanting more.  I bought this CD about two weeks ago, went on vacation over spring break with this cd, along with the rest of my CDs, but I ended up only listening to this one.  This is an awesome CD and band, I'm a new fan. !!!
B000002TQV|3.0|Radiohead, as a group, based on their accomplishments up to this point, are one of the best groups now or ever. &quot;The Bends&quot; is not Radiohead's worst album, in my opinion, but it comes close. There are a couple songs that are essential - among their best work - but this album is mostly subpar for Radiohead. &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;Nice Dream&quot; are both classic songs that belong on any &quot;Best of...&quot; album that you could compilate, but other than that, the songs on &quot;The Bends&quot; are not as good as most Radiohead songs, and certainly fall short of Radiohead's following album, their best, in the form of &quot;OK Computer&quot;.
B000000YBQ|5.0|Hard to believe that this music was recorded 44 years ago! As fresh and exciting and original and &quot;new&quot; today as it was then. I had the wondeful good fortune to be student in &quot;the Village&quot; in the mid 60's and on almost any given night, was able to walk over to the Vanguard to hear and SEE Bill Evans, or to the Five Spot for Monk, or the Half Note, where Al Cohn and Zoot Sims were regulars. What a great time for Jazz! Listening to Bill play here brings me back to those nights. I can see him, as I did then, hunched over the keyboard, trance-like, and that incredible sound, the harmonies, the ideas...brought chills up and down my spine. Put on a pair of head phones, lie back, darken the room, close your eyes, and listen. You will be touched and deeply moved in ways that most musicians can only dream of. This is PURE GENIUS, PURE BEAUTY, PURE DIRECT COMMUNICATION, from one soul to another! Thankfully, there is so much available on disc. Listen to it all, then... BUY IT ALL!
B00005JLK1|4.0|This is only an AVERAGE horror movie. It is entertaining but it did not surpass my expectations. I would give it 3 stars but it is a lot better than the other horror movie I saw in the last six months.<br />WARNING: There's a 30 second sceen at the beginning that is very bloody.
B000001E7V|4.0|Tricky's solo debut echoes the work of his former colleagues Massive Attack while simultaneously distancing himself from their influences. Lyrics from the Massive Attack songs \\"Karmacoma\\" and \\"Eurochild\\" surface (on \\"Overcome\\" and \\"Hell Is Around The Corner\\", respectively), likewise the subterranean yet catchy ambience for which MA became famous. However, lyrically, tracks like \\"Abbaon Fat Track\\" and \\"Suffocated Love\\" drip with sexual innuendo (the sexual undertones in MA songs are far more subtle). The dance between Tricky's vocal and Martina's is sheer mesmerizing genius. Overall, Tricky's musical approach is alternately harsh, yet endearing, which proves frustrating at first, but rewards repeated listening.
B0000714BP|5.0|Although critics have scrapped it as a Priscilla rip-of, it isn't. This movie has a different story to tell. Three drag queens set off to Hollywood to compete in the Miss Drag Queen America Pageant (There really is one you know) and in the process, discover their fabulousness and strengths. Patrick Swayzee is the demure Vida, an unsinkable optimist with a caring heart who is like the mother to this trio. Wesley Snipes is too wonderful as Noxzema Jackson, a sassy black queen who learns to reach further outside of herself and to trust again. John Leguizamo is Chi-Chi a fiery Latino &quot;boy in a dress&quot; who learns that it takes heart, strength and &quot;having a foundation closer to my own complexion&quot; to become a full fledged drag queen. This movie is an American Fable that guts, inner strength and a fabulous outlook can pull you through the bad times and that there is more love in this world than we think. Let go your perceptions and trust your heart, the movie says. We all want to be loved and beauty is more than looks--it is determination to live your dreams. Overall, Wong Foo is a gem, an overlooked movie with wonderful performances. Look for Stockard Channing who plays an abused wife who finds friends from unlikely places and her own voice. Also features cameos by Robin Williams and the one and only &quot;statuesque&quot; Julie Newmar.<br />Watch this movie and try not to use the word heartwarming.
B00004XONN|3.0|I think that, overall, this album is almost tied with \\"The Bends\\" as my least favorite album. It has a few great songs and, ironically, contains my favorite all-time Radiohead song, \\"Optimistic\\". Nevertheless, this album is too much of an unperfected new style that Radiohead introduced with \\"Kid A\\" and made better, but not perfected, with \\"Amnesiac\\". The song \\"Kid A\\" as well as \\"Morning Bell\\" (which was redone in a better version on \\"Amnesiac\\") are both good as well, but that's about it for me. Sorry to the many Radiohead fans that rank this at or near the top, and I am a huge Radiohead fan myself, but this album just didn't cut it for me on the whole, even though \\"Optimistic\\" is the BEST song!!!
B00008J4P5|4.0|In a similar line as contemporary acts The Vines and The Hives, this somewhat post-punk sounding duo comes with a very interesting proposal: a down-to-earth, forget-all-you've-heard-about-production, don't-polish-the-edges-type sound. For the fourth album by Jack and Meg White, it could be dismissed as a poorly produced album, but beware: there's more behind their work than jumps up right away. I had the opportunity to see to the guitar-drum duo live last night in Conan, and they were very impressive. In fact, Jack White (guitar) brought back memories of Jeff Buckley in more than one sense: the passion, his voice almost ripping his throat. This is an act to keep an eye on. The best of this recent wave of bands driven by the same inspiration and frustration that brought the punk and grunge movements to life.
0316666343|1.0|I really looked forward to reading this book, seeing as how it has been on the bestseller list for ages.  What a HUGE disappointment!  While I found the first half of the book rather engrossing, mid-way thru it literally just fell apart.  It made me think that the writer simply ran out of ideas and was searching for a way to end the book.  I almost didn't even finish it, because I totally lost interest.  Don't waste your money or time on this book.
6300267881|5.0|This quite simply in my opinion is the best horror if not the best movie I have ever seen.<br />I say this because I believe that besides &quot;The Godfather&quot; I have watched this film a ton of times and I don't get tired of it.The dialogue is perfect.The actors were tremendous to the point that I don't believe any other actors could have done better.I wish that I was there the very first time it was presented to the public in 1973,but I was only 4.This film will never become outdated in it's material and it's classic theme.There will never be another film which could deliver such shock value no matter the vulgar language.There have been countless imitations such as &quot;Beyond The Door&quot;,but this film is quite simply the BEST of it's kind.
B000062Y98|4.0|Blind Guardian is obviously one of my favorite bands. I first got into them from other bands &quot;playlists&quot; in other magazines, i.e, what members of other bands were listening to. I would say they peaked musically on &quot;Nightfall in Middle Earth&quot;. However, my favorite albums by them will always be their first four, for the ferocious speed metal and catchy anthems contained on them. This album is not neccesarily a dissapointment songwise, but with production. Some of the drums sound VERY triggered, something I did not expect from a drummer of the class of &quot;the omen&quot; Stauch.<br />Also, the canned synths really come down to sounding very artificial and contrived, unlike NIME's balance of sounds achieved by more &quot;realistic&quot; instruments and more acoustic guitars.<br />The songs are not as focused obviously as NIME either, so the songs have a tendency to wander off. However, that said, its still Blind Guardian. And besides the ignorance of many reviewers to their genius, this still remains a good, if not great, album. Lyrics have a lot more depth this time, ranging from religion to Nietzche and more current events. Of course they are still written in a &quot;fantastic&quot; way to not betray their &quot;fantasy metal&quot; tag. If this album is guilty of anything, it is most likely the lack of subtlety. However, unlike Rhapsody who seem to be making the same album over and over again, this still sounds different than most of the stuff out there and their previous albums. I'd say if you are new to Blind Guardian there are a few ways to approach it: Buy something like Imaginations first, then NIME second, then Tales third and go from there. Of course, with Hansi's vocals, it is either love them or hate them, but one of the things that attracted me to Blind Guardian initially were his vocals, they have none of the &quot;Kiske/Halford&quot; esque cliches inherent in most power metal.
B000002UR7|4.0|&quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, Radiohead's first album, was where I got my start with Radiohead. I loved &quot;Creep&quot; so much, but that was about it. Most of the other songs never appealed to me until years later, when I reintroduced myself to Radiohead with &quot;Amnesiac&quot;. I bought &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, and the first thing you realize when listening to it as compared to &quot;Amnesiac&quot; is that it is almost TOTALLY different. So, Radiohead have come a long way, and it's somewhat good and somewhat bad the progress they've made, but despite it, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; turns out to be a great album, even if it completely contrasts &quot;Amnesiac&quot; (another great album). It took quite a few listens to truly begin to appreciate &quot;Pablo Honey&quot;, but I certainly do recognize it as one of their better albums. It's a good album, and I am a &quot;true fan&quot; of Radiohead, so I suppose I am unorthodox in saying this. Maybe yes, maybe no. Just trust, it's a good album.
1573225517|5.0|High Fidelity is very well written and engaging, funny and honest, and I think everyone should read it. Single guys in their late 20's or 30's who haven't quite grown up yet - I include myself in that category - will especially identify with the (often self-constructed) trials and tribulations of Rob Fleming. Maybe they'll even understand themselves a little better after reading it. <br />And it helps if you're a record collector with an encyclopedic knowledge of pop music, and pop culture in general, but I don't think that's absolutely essential to identifying with the central character. Neither is being British (Rob gets transplanted to Chicago in the movie version, and overall the movie is pretty true to the flavor of the book) - but you might learn some entertaining British slang, such as the difference between \\"snogging\\" and \\"shagging\\".<BR>For me, High Fidelity consistently delivered flashes of recognition, a series of \\"I know exactly how he feels!\\" experiences, it was spookily dead-on. Examples: Ever gone out on the weekend with your parents as an adult and, nothing against your parents, but it makes you feel pathetic to be seen in public being escorted by your parents? Ever been obsessed with a woman and yet you can't picture what her face looks like, so that you end up imagining her with generic features, even though you have no trouble picturing the hot dog vendor you saw last week? Ever looked at a childhood photo of yourself and felt like you've failed him, because that's as good as his life is ever going to get? Hornby's descriptions are very true to life, sad and funny at the same time. At the end, it looks like at least the stage is set for Rob to finally move forward with his life (whether he actually does so is left open), and how he reaches that point is well worth seeing for yourself.
B00005NGZX|5.0|After over a year of having Jane Doe I can still listen to the record on a regular basis and still be throughly amazed. This album defies all Metal boundries and adds a new world to the hardcore genre. This is not a [petty]record. This is what metal is supposed to be and holds up to the Converge name. An absoultely incredible band with endless imagination and technical authority. This is a must have!!! INCREDIBLE mind-blowing record.
B00005JKWJ|4.0|As if to prove the old adage \\"if it ain't broke don't fix it,\\" \\"Blade 2\\" continues in essentially the exact same vein as its predecessor.  In other words, it's another combination of the old-fashioned vampire movie with the butt-kicking martial-arts extravaganza.  So if you liked the first one, you should have no problem getting into the sequel.  Of course, since \\"Blade 2\\" IS an action sequel, everything from the original has to get turned up a notch (or ten).  As a result, the fight scenes are more frenetic, the violence more graphic, the enemies more dangerous, and the special effects more extravagant.  The first \\"Blade\\" was very impressive visually, but this one makes it look like the original \\"Dracula.\\"  That said, the unremittingly bleak look and feel of the original is very well preserved in the sequel.  Since the vampire-hunting plot of \\"Blade\\" wouldn't have been as impressive in a sequel, this movie finds Blade hunting an even more fearsome foe: genetically engineered SUPER vampires!  That's right, Blade (reunited with Whistler and teamed with an elite crew of \\"regular\\" vampires) now has to take on a gang of \\"reapers\\" who are even stronger and more bloodthirsty than regular vampires, not to mention immune to silver and garlic.  Pretty scary.  Naturally, the plot stops for a killer fight scene every ten minutes or so, and the choreography and cinematography are enough to rival that of \\"The Matrix.\\"  It's all pretty far-fetched, but it does make for escapist entertainment at its finest.  And since \\"Blade 2\\" was gangbusters at the box office, hopefully they'll be getting a third installment out there soon.  Wesley Snipes has been all but typecast as an action hero by now anyway, so he might as well go with it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|SIMPLY AMAZING EVERY SONG IS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING--SIMPLY AMAZING
B000002UJQ|5.0|Simply a classic album by an immensely talented group, who have proven themselves to be unique in their genre (if they could ever be classified to just one genre) in their ability to consistantly rivet their audience. Most songs by Radiohead seem to have a common thread that is, more or less, a talent to create drowning melodies that are very involving and memorable. The lyrics don't always make much sense, but they cut very deep and are also memorable. This doesn't give enough justice to the songs, but I think that that is another uniquity of Radiohead's music: the fact that they are beyond that which words can describe. Songs of their's can be disturbing and beautiful in the same breath, and their music has been described (rightly) as &quot;ingenious&quot; in the past. The first time I heard &quot;Karma Police,&quot; I felt weak with the flow of emotion that I received, and still receive, when I heard the piano-laden chorus. The same goes for &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;, &quot;No Surprises&quot;, &quot;Lucky&quot;, &quot;The Tourist&quot;, &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot;, and &quot;Exit Music (For a Film)&quot; with their hauntingly beautiful melodies. Simply put, this album, almost the whole thing, is a true work of musical art and genious. Most of the other Radiohead albums have only a few memorable songs similar to those described here, but &quot;OK Computer&quot; is almost fully stocked with truly memorable music of a flavor that I have yet to experience with any other band on any sort of consistant basis. If you want to start listening to Radiohead, &quot;OK Computer&quot; is the best place to start.

We ordered this because it has so many good reviews and when we received it and read it, I am afraid we were left scratching our heads as to why all the good reviews????? There are so many other entertaining books out there, with much better illustrations for the very young..........don't spend your money on this one, it's is NOT worth it!
B00008OLYN|5.0|If you like Opeth's softer acoustic side, you will adore this album! I have always loved the softer and harder sides of Opeth but in Damnation its all soft, but there are still some points where your like AHHHH YEAH!!!!!! But Mikael never growls, clean singing very beautiful! thanks to Steven Wilson who helps out on the backing vocals every once and a while. Also, ths mixing is GREAT! Not a single weak point in my opinion. BY THIS ALBUM NOW!
B000002LGQ|5.0|Since Madonna has just released her new CD 'American Life,' I thought I would revisit her many previous albums.<br />As a Madonna fan since she first burst onto the Australian music scene in 1984, I have been following her career very closely and purchasing all of her music releases.<br />Released in 1989, Like A Prayer stands out as my personal favourite of her 80's releases. Already established as a major innovator of music, Like A Prayer took a step away from the overt commercialism of Like a Virgin with Madonna giving us lyrics written from the heart. The music is mostly traditional, with the synthesisers and technical wizardry kept to a minimum giving us a very clean sound of big band arrangements and classical interludes.<br />From the gospel strains of 'Like A Prayer' (the first single) to the power song 'Express Yourself', you can tell that this album is not merely another release to increase the commercial prowess of a pop icon, but an in-depth exploration of herself and her musicality.<br />'Till death do us part' is a stunning description of her stormy relationship with Sean Penn. The media only need listen to the lyrics of this song to get to the truth of what happen. Followed by 'Promise to try' - a beautifully simple arrangement of strings and piano that contains heartfelt lyrics of her feelings surrounding her Mother and her death.<br />My standout track on the album is 'Pray for Spanish Eyes'. An underrated Madonna song, it has a beautiful classical guitar accompaniment with Madonna singing about a subject close to her heart - love.<br />'Love song' - one of the few duets she has done (with Prince no less) is actually a very catchy tune. Shame it was never released as a single. The album is closed by what seems to be a spontaneous composition - Act of Contrition. Set against a music track of Like a Prayer played backwards with Madonna reciting a prayer. Only Madonna could get away with having something so non-commercial on a number 1 album.<br />If you're a relatively recent Madonna fan and have yet to hear this CD - make sure you do. You will discover an era of Madonna when she was a pioneer. Despite recent criticisms to the contrary, she is still one of the major forces in music today.
B000066NW0|5.0|I was blown away by this album. It was only her first and EVERY SINGLE song is excellent. I bought this originally because i liked &quot;Complicated&quot; and was rewared with 12 more great songs. All of them original and some are really angry (AWESOME SONGS). This is a good album if you like music that is original and excellent!!
6305171769|1.0|Halloween H20,another chance to try to cash in on the success of 1978's Halloween.They brought back Jamie Lee Curtis to try to intice fans,other are a few other big names involved also.This time it's just too boring.The movie is half the way through before you even see any killings or anything good like that.I say avoid this stinker!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|A film that tries to show us the evils of substance abuse by putting us into the heads of the abusers as much as possible.  The film is brilliantly edited so as to become more and more disjointed as the main characters fall deeper into despair.  This is an \\"artsy\\" movie that for the most part uses all the \\"cool\\" camera tricks, jump cuts, split screens, etc. for positive effect and not just to show off.<br />We follow Jared Leto and his friend Marlon Wayans, along with Leto's girlfriend Jennifer Connelly, as they decend deeper into their addiction.  At one point, they even come into a lot of money and opportunity, but the drugs destroy it all.  The other main story follows Leto's mother, played by Ellen Burstyn, a lonely older woman who believes she's going to be on a popular TV show, and decides she must loose weight.  She starts on diet pills and begins popping them like candy.  <br />The three younger characters chart a more predictable course.  Connelly and Leto have a lovely romance slowly come unraveled.  Wayans sees his dreams slipping through his fingers.  We've seen much of this before, but never this graphically. We aren't held at a distance by the director but rather we are pulled in to see things through their eyes.  All three actors are quite good, and Connelly, in particular is a revelation.  She'd done fine work before (and won an Oscar, of course, for her next film, A BEAUTIFUL MIND).  But it's her work in this film that should have drawn Oscar's attention.  Her final degredation is just about as low as we have seen a character sink in many a year.  Leto is always a good performer, and his final outcome is also a corker.  Wayans meets justice in a more predictable way, and his scenes in prison are almost farcical and are the only times the director totally loses control over the tone of his film.  Wayans is absolutely fine...the script and filmmaking strand him..and that's why the film only gets 4 stars.  It really deserves 4.5.<br />The reason, I think, that Connelly didn't get her Oscar nod for this film is that Ellen Burstyn absolutely runs away with the movie.  To say that her performance is brave only begins to state the facts.  Her character, basically, is driven mad by her addictions.  And we see it from her point of view.  We see how the delusions she suffers COULD drive you nuts.  We pity this poor, lonely woman, whose son is constantly stealing from her to buy drugs.  She is deluded.  Burstyn becomes physically unraveled as well.  I just don't know how she was able to do it.  In years past, we always rave about actor's undergoing physical transformations for their parts (DeNiro in RAGING BULL, Hanks in CASTAWAY, Zellweger in BRIDGET JONES!!) but the transformation Burstyn allows herself to go through is shocking and emotionally draining.<br />This movie is graphic and brutal and not for young kids.  But even though it is R-rated, this could be a \\"scared straight\\" film for teens.  And adults absolutely should see it.  I look forward to director Aronsky's next effort!!!
B000060P79|5.0|I've got this album last year and they seem to be a great up-and-coming band of punk when they hit big on t.r.l.My favorite songs are I'd do anything,I'm just a kid,and addicted which is the theme for fraternity life and I also like god must hate me and my alien.I really like the lead singer pierre,dave who sings and play the guitar and jeff,those are my favorite band members of simple plan.When I heard I'd do anything, mark hoppus of blink-182 is the guest in that song,it's pretty awesome because I'm into punk/rock and I'm sure that simple plan will have a new album out soon and they'll be touring and all that,I can't wait.SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS AND THEY'RE WICKED AWESOME!!!.
0385484518|2.0|A warm and sensitive portrayal of the relationship between two men but grossly overrated. A simplified view of complex issues. Not bad if you have a few extra minutes, like Bridges of Madison County or Love Story. OK for a nonreader. If you are literate, save your money. Check it out of the library.

B00006RAKP|5.0|I found this CD to actually have all of Elton John's greatest hits.  It always seems that there is some song missing on a greatest hits CD, but not the case for this one!  Although it's not the case for me, I would say if you have this CD, there is no need to own any other Elton John CD!
B00005JKOI|5.0|What can you say about those '80s movies featuring Molly Ringwald?  They're cheesy, fun, dated, timeless, stupid, incisive . . . plus they feature Molly Ringwald, a little hottie with a beautiful mouth and red hair and a lean body.  Oh my.  <br />Buy it just for the scence of her puting on her nylons.  <br />I did.
B00000JYGX|5.0|I studied the lyrics of this musical in my grade 11 French Immersion class and all of the students fell in love with it!  Plamondon's lyrics are so beautiful - they really evoke that Paris 'feeling'.  The cast is wonderful.  I particularly loved Bruno Pelletier's voice, but many of my friends were entranced by Garou's throaty growl.<br />The one complaint I have is that the womens' voices are rather weaker than the stellar male cast.  Perhaps its just the version I got (I think they might have changed the singer who did Esmeralda), but her voice was simply too weak to be the voice of the heroine.
B00006CXXU|5.0|This is definitely a great album, a great voice in it and a good work in general. I love Christina, I love her incredible voice and I think that this girl is really gifted and that she can truly sing. My faves: Walk Away, Fighter, Beautiful & Impossible.
0553106635|5.0|It seems obvious to me, by some of the reviews on here, that the crux of what this series is about is somehow lost.  From the first book we've seen magic increase (the dragons, the lady in red, Danny's attempts to get an army, etc).  Also, I find it amazing that anyone can comment on plot threads that haven't been resolved.  The series is supposed to last six books, so obviously there are going to be things that aren't tied up neatly.  Indeed, unlike his contemporaries (*coughcoughJordancoughcough*), Martin has REDUCED the number of main players in the series.  Where there was once six factions trying to gain the throne, now there are a mere handful.  Is there an overabundance of sex?  It depends on individual tastes.  However, what is written and suggested is not unrealistic.  In almost every aspect, the feel of the series is more like that of medeival England than of any fantasy setting.<br />It is a series that narrows its focus on the characters while expanding its focus to the world at large.  It is a series that is slowly adding magic into the mix, but does so with a sense of realism befitting the world he created.  I hate to pigeonhole like this, but it could be called the Babylon 5 of fantasy; there are powers controling (or trying to control) what's happening, but ultimately it's up to the people of the world to decide the fate of the world.  That is, if they can stop killing each other first.
0060012218|5.0|Geography Club is funny (I actually laughed out loud), smart, and engaging.  The characters are believably human--naturally imperfect, but also sometimes noble. <br />I'll admit that high school was a long time ago for me.  Still, I could so relate to Russel's (our protagonist's) struggle to figure out how to be honest (or how honest to be) and how to do the right thing in an unpredictable, sometimes unfriendly world.  Along the way, he experiences the power that friends have to make life worth living, even when everything seems to be going wrong.<br />Hartinger also presents straight folks (like myself) an opportunity to relive our awkward teenage moments from a gay perspective.  Having to be naked (or half naked) in public (ie: the locker room) was horrific for me as a chubby & nerdy kid. . . but just how much worse it could have been!  Imagine if one (or a few) of those other naked people were also extremely arousing. . . . .embarrasing, excruciating. . . and, the way Hartinger tells it, also extremely funny.  His gay teenagers are not angst filled, intense & depressed, as in so much other gay fiction.  They are funny, irreverent, lovable and real.<br />Geography Club is a fun read (I've already read it twice) even for a grown-up,  but it is definitely also a good book to share with kids.  Hopefully, it will inspire them to keep true to themselves, and to keep laughing and loving.
0066214122|3.0|Michael Crichton has made a name for himself writing techno/sci-fi-ish thrillers such as this one. While some of his past books are truly original and have opened up new fields of interest to the general public (Jurassic Park is an example of this) this one does not quite make it that far.<br />Don't get me wrong, the man is a master of the genre and leads the reader on a fast-paced, somewhat twisty path through the story. The book is interesting in that it is written in the first person--something Crichton does not normally do. But this deos exactly what is intended--breathe new life into a story and storytelling model that is somewhat old. In classic Crichton fashion the book begins slowly, introducing the ideas, the characters, the villains, and then speeds up and speeds up until it crahses to an end. This sort of pacing is what makes his books hard to put down, and also what makes them into fun films, but it is also formulaic and getting a bit tired.<br />The idea this book centers around--a nanotechnology swarm--is certainly new to my eyes. And it is an interesting one. But unlike some of his past novels, this one does not make me want to know more about nanotechnology, or bacterial growth, or any of the idea in it. And furthermore, the science, while somewhat strong, really tends more towards science-fiction here. The merging of biology and technology especially is far beyond anything scientists have accomplished and, while Crichton presents it as an emerging danger, I wonder how much of that is a marketing ploy.<br />Overall, a fun book, but not worth buying in hardcover--a perfect summer paperback if you ask me. Fun, exciting, and even a bit thoughtful, but beyond that nothing too fantastic. It ekes out considerably more than I thought possible from a style and genre that Mr. Crichton seems to have worked to death, but it is getting sick to be sure, and eventual death, while delayed, is certainly a strong possibility.
055357342X|5.0|This series pulls no punches it is a hard hitting affair.  It is fast and brutal and some won't like that. Based on the War of the Roses (real life) it captures the cruelty of that era in a fantasy setting.  No one is sacred and anything can happen.  These elements combined with great characterization have made an awesomely entertaining series so far.
0553579908|5.0|If only I could give more stars.  A Clash of Kings is, in a word, incredible.  The characters are written even more finely, and the action goes up a notch or twelve.  And magic (yes, magic) is finally beginning to show up in little bits.  Everything comes to a head in this book, and the results probably won't be what you expect.  This series is anything but formulaic.
B00008S2VH|5.0|I was one of the people that WAS NOT disappointed that Madonna didn't sing any of her old songs on 'The Drowned World Tour'. I really love the lyrics of this new cd, and the path her music has taken. Every song has something to say, and who says it better than Madonna. 'Hollywood' is my personal favorite. By the time this is posted Madonna will have already moved on to her next journey...can't wait!!!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I actually enjoyed watching this more then the first one.  I never left my seat at home till it was over.  The movie seemed to be over to soon it held my interest so well.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I did not find this movie to be the least bit amusing.
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones is the first installement of the best fantasy series I've read so far.  It is character driven fantasy at its best: all of the characters are unique, they grow and change, and, most importantly, they're believable.  Indeed, this book reads more like a work of historical fiction than any other fantasy title I've read.  It is Martin's daring choices throughout the novel that gives it its greatest strength.<br />Unlike most other fantasy titles, magic and fantastic creatures have a very little part to play.  There are no spell-slinging wizards, or magic swords, or goblins, or any of the other staple ingredients of most fantasy novels.  The most fantastic part of this fantasy is the nature of the world's seasons.  Summers and winters can last for years, even decades.  And as those of House Stark say, winter is coming....<br />As remarkable as Martin's non-fantastic fantasy setting is, it is his deft control over the characters that is most worthy of praise.  Every character, from Lord Eddard Stark to a random innkeeper, is interesting.  They are, for lack of a better word, alive.  Martin writes so wonderfully that it is hard not to think the characters are sitting nearby telling you this marvellous tale.  Martin doesn't get too wrapped up in the well-being of those characters, however.  Unlike most other fantasy authors, Martin is willing (and able) to kill off major characters.  Indeed, it is a wonderful shock to see an author that celebrates his characters by proving once and again that they are mortal.  He does not kill more than he needs to in order to tell the tale.  Indeed, the best way I can put it is like this:<br />There is no main protagonist, nor is there a promenent antagonist.  The story, rather, is THE character of the novel.  And I wouldn't have it any other way.
B00005JLEU|1.0|Boy, I am a bit shocked by all the great reviews for this film. I had read great things about this film before I got it last weekend. My kids liked Kiki. In short, this film was horrible, dreadful, and bizarre. Hard to follow. Scary for kids (6 and 8 year old) and adults (me). My kids have seen PG films before with scary scenes (Harry Potter, etc.), but this was a bizarre sort of scary. Sure, the storyline is a nice tale, which gives it a one star in my book, but perhaps this was one where the film should have been \\"Disney-ized\\" before pushing it as a family film. It makes me want to avoid Japanese anime even more!
1587990717|4.0|The central image of this interesting, erudite and somewhat self-indulgent book is the &quot;black swan,&quot; a metaphor for both the rare event that eventually will happen, and for the fact that you can't prove a negative (the problem of induction) because no matter how many white swans you count, you do not prove that the next one won't be black.<br />Taleb's central thesis is that many people are successful in the markets and in life not because they are clever or skillful, but because they are lucky.  They are the beneficiaries of randomness.<br />Randomness (or &quot;luck&quot; or &quot;chance&quot;) is one of those illy-defined abstractions that may or may not actually exist in the real world, but is very handy nonetheless.  Certainly no one has yet come up with a device that gives truly random results.  Indeed even if such a device were found (say the digits of pi) how could we be sure the results are random?  The human mind finds patterns in all things of any complexity from cloud formations to stock charts.  But should we ever find a complex entity, say a string of numbers, in which we can discern no pattern, we can surmise that that string is not random because a purely random result would not be constrained by the requirement that there be no pattern!<br />Thus the paradox of randomness that Taleb addresses.  He argues persuasively, using evidence from science, literature, and his own experience as a derivatives trader, that the human mind is not wired to cope with randomness.  He believes that we see causality and order where there is none.  We think we become rich or poor based on our wise or unwise behavior, but Taleb believes that much of the time it is capricious chance that accounts for our fate.<br />Thus Bill Gates becomes fabulously rich not because his software was the best or even because he worked harder than anyone else or because he was smarter, but because he was luckier. (Just ask his competitors!)  Taleb calls the rise of Microsoft &quot;a spectacular lucky success.&quot; (p.145)<br />What we don't see, Taleb assures us, as we gaze upon these successes are the &quot;alternate histories,&quot; that is, the lives of those very many who tried and failed to achieve success.  Taleb uses an old con (p. 128) to illustrate this point: Suppose you are a money manager seeking clients.  You send out a newsletter to 10,000 prospects predicting with absolute certainty in 5,000 of the letters that the market will rise next month, and in the other 5,000 that it will fall.  If it goes up you now send out 5,000 more letters to those who received the bullish prediction, in 2,500 of them predicting again that the market will go up next month, and in the other 2,500 that it will go down. You repeat this and after seven months you will have about 78 potential clients left who have seen you predict market direction unerringly for seven months in a row!<br />I first encountered this scheme in the world of sports betting in Las Vegas.  A tout guarantees a mortal &quot;lock&quot; on an NFL football game, half of its sheets touting team A and the other half team B.<br />Taleb applies this phenomenon to marketing executives, asserting, &quot;One can make money in the financial markets totally out of randomness.&quot; (p. 80)  What he means again is that one can get lucky.  And this can go on for a long time.  If you happened to be a &quot;dip buyer&quot; and traded stocks during the middle to late nineties, you did very well.  There were some people who entertained only that idea, and ended up looking like geniuses.<br />But in this &quot;analysis&quot; Taleb is guilty of the very bugaboo he warns against, namely that of seeing patterns in data, and assigning causality to events, where there is none.  It may be the case that the &quot;dip buyer&quot; carefully assessed the market everyday and the result of his technical and fundamental analysis was that in virtually every case his research was the deciding factor, not any propensity to buy on dips.<br />Was it luck or expertise?  It is hard to say for sure.  Well, when is it NOT luck? one might ask.  Dr. Taleb anticipates this question and responds, &quot;To be honest, I am unable to answer it.&quot; (p. 141)<br />Taleb is on solid ground however when he warns against &quot;data snooping.&quot; (pp.134-135)  This fallacy of &quot;fitting the data to the rule&quot; is something every trader (and sports bettor, by the way) should know about.  You can look at past results and if you look long enough you will find a pattern.  That pattern usually is randomness fooling you.  Bet on that pattern and you will have the same expectation that you would have if instead you threw darts at the market pages of the newspaper and bet on the stocks the darts hit.  Taleb doesn't mention this, but the way to separate the chaff of the past from the wheat is to have an empirical theory first and then test that theory against the data.  If your theory is a good one and the data supports the theory, you may have discovered something.  This is not the same thing as fitting the data to the theory or &quot;data snooping.&quot;  This is in fact science.  To find something like this in the financial markets, however, is like the alchemist's dream of transmuting lead into gold.<br />&quot;I am emotional and derive most of my energy from my emotions&quot; Taleb tells us. (p. 180)  This is something we all do.  The difference--as Taleb happily tells us--is that he knows what drives him but most of us don't.  We imagine that we act from reason.propensity to buy on dips.<br />Was it luck or expertise?  It is hard to say for sure.  Well, when is it NOT luck? one might ask.

0380715430|4.0|Perhaps riddled with error and contradictions in logic, Bryson's book nonetheless is an amiable romp through the history of the English language for we (us?) non-philologists (philolophobes?). Bryson is first and foremost a humorist, a social commentator, and his work should be read as a the work of a dilettante. He ain't no professer of linguistiks!<br />Bryson does do an admirable job of introducing all the pit-and  pratfalls associated with the language, and I, for one, was absolutely stunned by the swiftness and extent of change that occurs constantly in our English, as portrayed by the author. I laughed at some - not many - of his jokes. Ultimately, it's not the humor that's this book's strong point, it's the protagonist, the hero of this drama, the English language that steals the show. Bryson is the carnie, the man who calls out to us and troops us by the freaks and geeks - the oddities of spelling and grammar, perhaps? - and we walk about the chaotic, disorganized spectacle, taking it all in.<br />So if you're curious about English, check out this book. If you're looking for strong research material, move along!
B00008S2VH|4.0|The CD is awesome! It has some of Madonna's most intimate songs I've ever heard from her career. ITs very diffrent and very unique. IT has techno songs like Die Another Day and songs that are just Madonna and an acoustic guitar, (my favorite songs). These some what acoustic guitar songs are Hollywood, X-Static process, Mother and Father and Easy Ride. IT was totally worth it but... it was not worth [extra money] for a limited Edition. I thought that there would be a DVD in the CD (like it was advertised) with the video that she pulled out, instead its just a 2 minute behind the scenes that I saw on MSN last week. It comes in a leather box instead of a plastic CD case and comes with a poster with about 30 stamps of the CD's cover. All in all great but it dosen't come with the lyrics! I would of expected more from Madonna. Bottom Line: Madonna is still great no matter what, except the Limited Edition is not worth... more [than] the normal CD.
B00005CCA9|2.0|I cannot for the life of me conceive why Argerich's performance of Rachmaninoff's 3rd Piano Concerto is so widely touted as the preeminent recording of the work. There are far, far better. Argerich's gift is redoubtable, but however promethean her virtuosity, the reckless extravangances of technique here are both pretentious and infuriatingly hollow. The penchant among musical \\"personalities\\" to over-sentimentalize the work has done much to damage Rachmaninoff's standing with serious musicians, relegating an otherwise scintillating concerto to the popular rubbish heap. Argerich, Horowitz, and Wild are at the vangard of this lamentable trend. What should be sweeping, subtle, exploratory and --above all-- regal is warped into an insipid vehicle for pomp.<br />For more technically erudite devotees of the work, there is very little here to savor. Conceding even the difficulties inherent to live performance, Argerich handles the first movement's closing cadenza (the alternate, \\"lighter\\" of two versions) messily; likewise the much-beloved cascading leitmotif intro of the second. Passion notwithstanding, wrong notes are wrong notes, however quickly you flit over them. Her phrasing is execrably muddy in more than a few passages, and her approach to the more meditative instances of this robust piece all but patronizing.<br />Rachmaninoff's work must be played with poise, not tongue-in-cheek ardor. Listeners do well to treat themselves instead to Arcadi Volodos' superlative interpretation --also live, and exquisitely rendered. His approach in everything Mrs. Argerich's is not: subtle, delicate, informed, and technically flawless. <br />The indomitable 3rd Piano Concerto deserves am artist willing to arrest their histronic impulses and champion clarity above showmanship.
B000003TAB|1.0|Simple music for simple people, that's the way I look at it. You all are bragging about the lyrics and how deep they are, but they bore me to tears. Whine and complain about how awful life is. Tell me something I don't already know. I listen to music to escape reality, not relive it. If I wanted to hear about how bad life really is, then I would listen to my girlfriend or any of my friends for that matter. All I can say about these guys is... I'm glad they are no more.
B00005OAIE|5.0|Congratulations to this artist on an exceedingly brilliant musical work. John Mayer, with Room for Squares, proves that he is truly the next great singer/songwriter. The album is filled with lyrics that are richly intelligent, playful, and passionate...and musical craftsmanship so superb, so sublime, that, at times, it soars into near-rapture . It is this artist, with this work, who truly deserved the lion's share of Grammy awards this year.
B00008OLYN|5.0|I have been waiting anxiously for this album to come out for some time now.  Now that I have it, all I can honestly say is that Opeth's music is just so above and beyond most anything else out there, it makes me shudder to see how much American music has decayed over the last 25 years(American Idol).  About the album, my initial impression was adapted Pink Floydish tunes with Swedish Folk and even a few Latin touches here and there.  To see a metal band pull off a mellow, haunting album is very promising, and I hope that other metal bands explore thier influences as thouroughly as Opeth has. Windowpane is amazing!  My other favorites are Hope Leaves and To Rid the Disease. This is a very dark, deep, depressing, haunting album, but what else would you expect from Opeth. My favorite Opeth album remains Still Life for now and Damnation is tied with Deliverance and Blackwater Park for second.  BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU APPRECIATE QUALITY MUSIC!!
B000005ZGZ|4.0|I love this album! I have to admit firstly, though, I was no Fugazi fan before this.  Friends had subjected me to \\"Repeater\\" time and time again...I just didn't get them.  Then this! \\"Arpeggiator\\" is a superb track, but I also think \\"Five Corps\\" and some of the other tracks are catchy.  <br />This album has Fugazi leaning more towards sounding like they're from Chicago than DC, but then , Trans Am is from DC, too, aren't they?

B00003CXE7|4.0|I'm talking about the signature series double disc ov course. Anyways , everyone who lived on this planet for the past 20 years has defenitely heard or seen clips of this movie. It's good and Ridley Scott does a great job at directing this big film because that is what it is! The film spans all the way to a war with barbarians and other opponents in the beginning to the war within Rome's own human civilization. Anyways Maximus is a true warrior in the film and I love the old fashion tactics they used when fighting against the herd of monsters from within the colesium. If you liked films with very early history crossed with a struggle and rise story of a warrior than this is a movie to buy for you, a friend, or family member. If not than you should at least see this film in it's entire viewing.
0156012197|2.0|This new Richard Howard translation is a travesty when compared with the translation by Katherine Woods that publisher Harcourt, Inc. has replaced.  Howard has reduced the text to its lowest common denominator which the publisher calls \\"streamlined\\" and \\"new and improved\\". I call it impoverished and completely devoid of charm. I can't imagine what the publishers were thinking when they chose to replace the classic translation which beguiled us all during its 57 years in print and am reminded of Coca Cola's \\"New Coke\\" fiasco...an error which was quickly remedied. The ONLY positive comment I can make is that the color illustrations in the paperback edition are an improvement on the black & white illustrations of its paperback predecessor. <BR>   The only good news is that you can still obtain used copies of the Woods translation at Amazon or your local used book shop. Look for the white cover and a publication date prior to the year 2000.

B000069HZP|4.0|To be honest I like this film because of all the films i nthe thriller genre where you can almost predict the ending and the upcoming twists and turns in some parts than this is one of those films but with it's great cast, state of the art cinematography, the movie is made as complex as can be for this simple plot. Michael Douglas' character is a total hardass that is pure and simple...business day and night. His brother played by Sean Penn gives him a gift which is a game in which they get involved in Douglas' character's life and play games on his mind. That can only happen if he (Douglas) visits the office in which they have to get information on him and do some health examinations. The people in the building start even playing mind games on him after hours of testing by just letting him stay in a room and leave him there forgotten to the world. Well after that you just have to watch for yourself but I love how the movie makes his life twist and disappear like nothing... a good film!
B000000XB9|5.0|What an album. Great songs and one of those few albums that is good from start to finish. &quot;Suzie Q&quot; starts out with Fogerty's playing this great opening lick. &quot;I put a spell on you&quot; amazing song with just as amazing solo work and great blues rhythm, just awesome.  So many great hits on this collection that it is hard to believe one band could do this. One song in particular really got me was &quot;Someday Never Comes&quot;. Such a sad song but the emotion it bring out. The song gives me chills every time I listen to it. This album is a must have for every music lover.
B000068MKZ|5.0|I heard Carla Bruni in a store when I was in Europe, and I just had to get it when I got back to the States.  Her voice is unique, almost taking you by surprise at first, but the more I listen to the CD, the more I like it.  The soft guitar and her soothing voice compliment each other nicely, providing an almost nostalgic yet refreshing feeling for her listeners. I would recomend it to anyone who appreciates good music.
0553293397|4.0|THE CAVES OF STEEL was, in my humble opinion, an all-time science fiction classic.  THE NAKED SUN is the direct sequel and is extremely satisfying, thought be many to be better than the original.  Personally, I feel it failed a bit, especially as a mystery.  This is still superlative science-fiction writing.  <br />This time, Elijah needs to travel to another world, a traumatic challenge to one who's never been outside Earth's \\"caves of steel\\".  He is venturesome enough though to want to actually experience the open air and \\"naked sun\\" of another planet and this causes some conflict with android partner, R. Daneel Olivaw, who following the three laws of robots needs to protect the detective from harm.<br />Again, the mystery part of the story owes to the classic \\"locked room mystery\\" subgenre in that the murder is one which appears to be an \\"impossible\\" one.  Since the murder occured, though, there is only one apparant person who could possibly have committed it.  <br />The Solarians have through their history and their reliance on robots developed a physical aversion to each other, husbands and wives being the only ones who tolerate contact with each other, and Solarian science is working to develop artificial insemination so that even that contact will no longer be necessary.  <br />As the detective conducts his investigation, he becomes more involved with his belief that Earth must participate in colonization of other habitable worlds, and so this novel while telling its own story also develops the thread that eventually leads to the author's Empire and Foundation series.  I am not sure whether or not Isaac Asimov, at the time that he wrote this novel, had any idea of developing R. Daneel Olivaw into such a pivotal factor as he eventually becomes, but it seems to me that there are slight hints here of the robot's leaning more on his reasoning ability, in spite of the fact that robots are not supposed to have any reasoning ability.  <br />Again, after reading thisbook, I believe one will very much want to continue into Asimov's future history.
B00008PW3O|5.0|Say You Will is an awesome CD.  It's also a tribute to Stevie and Lindsey's incredible talents and abilities as singers, songwriters and musicians.  Say You Will is a tribute to coming full circle.  FM's popularity shot through the roof when Stevie and Lindsey joined the band and now Say You Will is a return to those days.  <br />This album is awesome for Stevie's songwriting and singing talent and for Lindsey's incredibly inventive and experimental musical approach.  Combined, Stevie and Lindsey's talents result in 18 expertly crafted songs.  <br />I think Say You Will is the best FM album for many reasons.  This album is a testiment to the fact that Stevie and Lindsey haven't gotten stuck in the past.  They have evolved gracefully and they have changed.  Say You Will IS NOT Rumours and I say thank God for that.  Rumours was great, but that was 25 years ago.  <br />I've read so many reviews of this CD already and I'm quite shocked that anyone could dislike it.  Many don't like the fact that Christine isn't present.  Many say \\"it's not Rumours\\", while others say \\"it's not what I expected\\".  I didn't expect anything.  As an artist myself, I know how important it is to grow and change.  I had no expectations because I wouldn't know where to begin to come up with expectations.  Say You Will surprises me in it's richness and it's depth.  It surprises and pleases me with its anti-war statements and social commentary.  It surprises me with the clarity of Stevie's voice.  It surprises me by proving once again that Lindsey really does know how to produce Stevie's songs.  <br />All of Stevie's songs are excellent.  I'm sitting here trying to decide how I would rank her songs on this CD and the honest answer is that they are all great.  \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" is noteworthy for its emotion and anger and for its instrumental arrangement which shows a sophistication not usually found in FM songs.  \\"Goodbye Baby\\" is all about Stevie's incredible voice, as is \\"Silver Girl\\".  \\"Destiny Rules\\", \\"Thrown Down\\" and \\"Say You Will\\" all have infectuous melodies and lyrics.  \\"Running Through the Garden\\" is a great rock song.  \\"Smile at You\\" is a song known to many Stevie fans because it's been circulating as a bootleg.  It is so good to hear a production version of the song that is all polished.  And \\"Illume\\"...what can I say.  This is a beautifully crafted song about the raw emotion of being trapped in NYC during the events of 9-11.  Stevie is a talented storyteller!<br />Lindsey opens Say You Will with \\"What's the World Coming To?\\".  From the first few drum beats, I could tell the Mac was back.  The social commentary of this song along with \\"Ed Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" and \\"Peacekeeper\\" are truly timely with the war in Iraq and the news coverage of the war.  \\"Miranda\\" and \\"Come\\" are great examples of Lindsey's talent.  I have to admit I'm not sure what \\"Red Rover\\" is all about but I'll assume it is political with it's references to red, white and blue.  \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" and \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" are both wonderful love songs.  <br />The bonus live tracks are great for the simple fact that as much as I like Lindsey's production of this album, I happen to believe that the sign of a great group is their live performances and FM has always been great.  <br />So, in closing...there is no such thing as too much Lindsey or too much Stevie.  FM has changed and evolved over time and have proven just one more time that this is not a test...this is real.  Rumours was not a fluke...because FM has done it again.  <br />Say You Will is every bit as great as Rumours...only different.
B000056HUA|5.0|This DVD-A edition sounds superb.  This DVD-A makes this CD sound like they recorded it last week, not 30 years ago.  The ability to separate the instruments allows your base and tower speakers to do the heavy lifting while the surround acts as a perfect fill for the rythm and light percussion.  Wow.
B00006AW2M|5.0|Yes, it's true. This is my favorite Stones album. Not their best, but my favorite. In about 1974, &quot;Citadel&quot; turned me from a little boy into a teenager in about three minutes. &quot;2000 Man&quot; was my theme song for the Millenium. I learned how to jam listening to the &quot;Sing This Altogether&quot;s. &quot;She's a Rainbow&quot; and &quot;The Lantern&quot; bring back very specific memories. &quot;Gomper&quot; and &quot;2000 Light Years From Home&quot; are great stoner tunes. And of course, &quot;In Another Land&quot; is the worst song ever written!<br />Which reminds me of a story. And I'm gonna tell it to you right now!<br />A year or two after &quot;Citadel&quot; turned me into a teenager, my best friend &quot;Robert&quot; had a crush on a girl named &quot;Sharon.&quot; (the names are being changed to protect the clueless!) &quot;Robert&quot; came up with this brilliant idea! He was going to write a love poem to &quot;Sharon&quot; and tape it to front door, ring the doorbell and run! Well actually, I was going to tape it to the door and ring the doorbell and run. Actually, I was going to write the poem as well, since he didn't know how to write a poem!<br />I wasn't any more experienced in the arts of poetry and seduction, but I had listened the Their Satanic Majesties Request for the hundredth time the night before. I decided to have a little fun with &quot;Robert.&quot; I wrote on a piece of paper for him:<br />&quot;In Another Land, where the breeze and the trees and the flowers were blue,<BR>I stood and held your hand, and the grass grew high and the feathers floated by. <BR>I stood and held your hand. <BR>And nobody else's hand will ever do. <BR>Nobody else will do...&quot;<br />Robert was impressed! He made me stick the poem to the door for him, while he waited in the bushes nearby. I ran the bell and ran off! &quot;Sharon&quot; called him up the next day, and the two of them &quot;went steady&quot; for two or three months!<br />The following year, &quot;Robert&quot; had a crush on &quot;Susan&quot; and asked me if I remembered the words to that poem that &quot;I wrote&quot; the year before. (I never told him the truth about it!) I said that I did.<br />&quot;In Another Land, where the breeze and the trees...&quot;<br />Taped to door, doorbell rung, boys run off... &quot;Susan&quot; called him, they &quot;went steady&quot; for two or three months. You get the picture.<br />Three or four years later, I hadn't seen &quot;Robert&quot; in a couple of years. I was sitting at a card table in a friend's basement. &quot;Sharon&quot; and &quot;Susan&quot; were there and happened to be sitting on a couch right behind me. My ears perked up when I heard one ask the other:<br />&quot;Hey, didn't you go out with that goofball Robert in like junior high?&quot;<BR>&quot;Yes! He wrote the stupidest poem you can imagine and like taped it to my door and rang the doorbell and ran off! It was just so cute that I couldn't resist, so we went out together for a few weeks.&quot;<BR>&quot;Oh my god! That sounds exactly like what happened with me!&quot;<br />At that moment I turned around and said to the two of them:<br />&quot;In Another Land, where the breeze and the trees and the flowers were blue, <BR>I stood and held your hand, and the grass grew high and the feathers floated by. I stood and held your hand...&quot;<br />Naturally, a good laugh was had by all, at the expense of poor old &quot;Robert&quot; and of course, Bill Wyman!
B000089RVX|5.0|I am a big fan of mostly eveything un-mainsteame, and New Metal would normally make my angry and want to break my cd player, but this, this is good.  This is better than the usual New Metal!  This is a combination of melody and aggression not normally shown in the face of radio.  This is what I look for in metal, a great big brick of heavyness with a flower drawn on the side.  A fast, in your face sound while still keeping a grasp on melody and actual form and not just trying to blow your eardrums out or sell an album.  If mainstream music keeps going in this direction... well I might just have to start watching MTV agian!
0743424425|5.0|This book is an all time classic. I'm not even going to try to sell newcomers to this book, because if you haven't read it by now, you need to take a new perspective on your reading entertainment.<br />I was 16 when I read first read this book. I was staying with my brother that summer and he was out partying with friends. I was in his rickety, creaking old house all by myself on a stormy night (I'm not making this up!). I got to the scene when the hedge animals started moving and got so scared I had to put the book down while thunder was shaking the foundation and lightning was flashing in the windows. I was wishing my brother was home and happened to glance down at a review quote that was on the back cover. It said something like &quot;don't read this book alone at home on a stormy night&quot;. I thought about that for a moment and ran screaming from the room.<br />Talk about impact. This book SCARED me!
B00006M183|5.0|I basically just wanted to write this review to respond to a review I read above.  Someone said something about Creed being the leader of the new modern grunge movement... CREED? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?  This band is awful, stick with the already solid Pearl Jam,and believe me, you will come away without a headache.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Great songs throughout the entire album.  The band is getting the most out of their studio experience and this album sounds a bit less raw than their 1st.  That's not a bad or good thing.  They still sound great and Shannon Larkin's drum work is no drop-off from their original drummer.  The dude can play.  Also, great solo work by Tony on several songs.<br />Long live hard rock!!<br />Get smacked ASAP and buy this (and their first 2 albums also)
0131103628|3.0|Altogether a good book. Not very good for beginning programmers and a bit to brief. It doesn't cover many topics well enough.

6304712936|5.0|A very great movie from whatever point of view. <br />A musical friend of mine denounced it saying the movie only depicted Mozart as a naughty boy. \\"Yes, but look\\", I said, \\"isn't it the truth?...\\"<br />The use of viewpoint in this movie is a huge success: Mozart was seen from the eye of his jealous fellow royal-court composer who fell on his knees in front of Mozart's genius. But no matter how much respect he had for the works of Mozart's genius, and no matter how hard he himself strived, he remained a mediocrity and a laughing stock of Mozart. Ironically, it was this jealous colleague whom Mozart subsequently had to rely on for his bread and then in an ingenius way this secretive admirer of his sent him to his grave...<br />The fate of Mozart was in fact doomed by his upbringing. His father indulged him on his musical training to the neglect of everything else. As a result Mozart's urge for music was so strong yet his ability to cope with the basics of life was so weak. In a way it was his father who put this genius to an abrupt death. The invisble hand of his father was so subtlely depicted. There he hurried to Vienna to his son on a mission to bring him back to the church, dressed in a dark cloak more like a vampire than a priest. And in the masquerade held in honour of him, the father put on the same cloak again. Later Mozart's jealous colleague deliberately wearing the same cloak knocking upon his door late at night commissioned him to write a \\"Requiem\\" of his own, pushing him further when he was already on the verge of death... <br />Mozart's giggles were disturbing but they serve at least two purposes: as a symbol that (i) Mozart was a most spontaneous genius who couldn't withhold his emotions and thoughts and (ii) showing Mozart, in a way, was not well-bred enough. This also triggered the trap which befell him... <br />Nevertheless, one wonders wherefrom Mozart got the uttmost sense of beauty and above all, the immense humanity as shown in his music? Perhaps that is too uninteresting to have it mentioned however briefly. That I suppose is what my friend was objecting to.<br />Yes, the movie is long but one could easily finish it in one breath and it can keep you tight in your seat and you will hardly notice that 160 minutes had passed since. <br />Highly recommended.
B00008DDXC|2.0|i have no idea why this movie was given a PG rating, there where many disturbing scenes in the movie that i thought was too much for the kids, like the dead cat and the ghost that hung himself... i think the harry potter series is some sort of brainwashing program that will end up bieng a big cult. the author of this book has a warped sense of imagination and should stick to her previous career, selling cookies or whatever the [heck] she did before she wrote this discrace in literature called harry potter.
B00000F5KH|5.0|A very touching story. So some say it's a real story. It does look like so judging from the realistic way it is presented, it's very convincing indeed.<br />From this movie one would be able to see a cross section of the life in Brazil. Their passionate religous faith,their helplessness, their economy, their outlook, various towns and everything...<BR> <BR>Often one's fate is predestinated and hinged upon the change of a thought of somebody else no matter he/she is related to to you or not. Here the boy's fate turned at least twice. First he dropped the toy on the roadway which his mother decided to and subsequently bought to him causing her a fatal traffic accident. And then it turned upon the retired teacher who sold him and later changed her mind and decided to rescue him from the kids-monger and brought him back to his father who had earlier abandoned him living with another woman and died before meeting this boy...<br />But this is not exactly a tragedy. There was the meldramatic episode of the retired teacher with the truck driver. Even the relation between this retired teacher and the boy are so full of humantiy and tenderness. <br />Highly recommended.<br />-
B00005N5S5|4.0|James Cameron first came to fame with this groundbreaking sci-fi film, this was the first time that a sci-fi film was set in the modern world as we knew it at the time as opposed to outer space.<BR>The story of this film involves time travel as a fact, not just a concept. The year is 1984, and life is going on as normal for everyone, until one fateful night when a creation of the year 2029 travels back in time. This creation is called a 'terminator', a killing machine which looks like a human which has been sent back in time to kill a young woman who is fated to give birth to a man who leads the human revolution against the machines. However, to ensure that his birth will prevail, the leader of the resistance,John Connor, sends a soldier under his command back to the same time in order to save his mother from being killed.<BR>This film will be 20 years old next year, but nobody can have any doubt that it's a modern classic. The special effects of this film look crude compared to other sci-fi offerings of the past decade, however, the brilliance of this film is in the telling of the story and of James Cameron's ability to convey the story by using other characters to talk about other events that have happened ie. the name of the woman targeted by the terminator is Sarah Connor. The terminator, not knowing exactly who she is, kills another two women by the same name. But instead of seeing him kill both women, you see and hear two detectives talking about two murder case reports received that day in the precinct.<BR>The extra features of this DVD are simply excellent, some of the deleted scenes make other scenes in the film make more sense. There is a retrospective interview with James Cameron and Arnold Schwarzenegger, interesting bits of trivia such as James Cameron originally having Arnold in mind to play the part of the protecting soldier and have O.J Simpson play the terminator(?!). If you are a big fan of all things sci-fi, classic or modern, go out and buy thisDVD.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This album is, to date, the Stripes' finest hour. The production on this record is really stunning, especially considering that the equiptment that was used to record it does not date past 1963. Jack and Meg have gotten noticeably more experimental since \\"White Blood Cells\\", and it's evident on tracks like \\"There's No Home For You Here\\" and \\"Seven Nation Army\\". Don't get the wrong idea though- the band hasn't lost their roots, they've simply built more off them and by doing so, have totally improved their already amazing sound. Ignore the comparisons to \\"Exile on Main St.\\" and \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\"; this is no imitation and will truly stand the test of time.
B000067CPX|5.0|I've never really heard much of RHCP's work, save for &quot;Give It Away&quot; and &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;. But after hearing just a scant few of the tracks from &quot;By The Way&quot; I had to buy it!<br />The song writing is masterful, funny, and at times spot-on! I never imagined RHCP performing such wonderful harmonies either. (Check out &quot;Dosed&quot; and you'll see what I mean!)<br />I agree with other reviews that every song is a gem. Rarely do you find an album where every song fits perfectly into the whole. I can count on one hand how many albums I personally know of that fit that description.<br />Some works get overhyped, but take it from a musical cynic that this is one CD worth getting!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Ever since the Queen of Pop releases her album, people, especially a fan like me expects a new innovations from Madonna.  The &quot;American Life&quot; album exhibits Madonna's being a guru in invention.  The mode of music (as an entire genre) is more likely in 80's beat, but very modern, and very out of this world style of music.  My personal favorite songs in her &quot;American Life&quot; album are &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Nothing Fails&quot;, &quot;Love Profusion&quot;, and &quot;Easy Ride&quot;.  Of course the song &quot;American Life&quot; is also my favorite.  In addition, compared to her previous album, this album have wordy lyrics which really expresses Madonna's life like the song &quot;Mother and Father&quot;.  I bought &quot;American Life&quot; album (Obviously), and all I can say that it is a MUST BUY album.  Enjoy her music.  It is worth buying....
0316666343|3.0|I also loved the first two thirds of the story; the ending was poor.  Harvey's death was disappointing as well as Susie not being found, but perhaps alluded to being found in the future.  Also, if Ruth really had sixth sense, why could't Susie help point her to her own body parts?  Hey - if Susie could come on down for a quickie with Ray, why not fill him in?  She could talk, after all.  That made zero sense.  And her charm bracelet being found in the end was unnecessary. After all, the person who found it had no idea whose it was thereby...not evidence as to what happened to Susie.  I found the author leaving Susie's not being found disappointing, to say the least.
B000002MFN|5.0|No matter of what Madonna herself thinks about this record now (obviously, shes kinda trying to deny the whole \\"Erotica period\\" since \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Deeper And Deeper\\" are not included on her latest video collection) in my opinion its simply one of her best albums to date. She delivers very catchy yet mature music, \\"Where Life Begins\\" is one of her most haunting ballads ever. Erotica just screams \\"Live your live be free\\". Its a shame that it was so terribly underrated and overlooked back then. I have to admit that I like the Madonna from the mid-80s to the mid-90s more than the Madonna of now, although the new album \\"American Life\\" is also a real stunner. She just seems so out of this world with her new \\"know all & be all\\" attitude...

I heard the Leper Affinity twice in a row... then bought the album the next day... and the rest is history.<br />Ever wonder why this band has become so popular? Well, maybe because they are THAT GOOD. Blackwater Park is a perfect album in my opinion... a title that not even any of their other releases can touch. Each track is an opus of beautifully dark and heavy riffs, melodic riffs, mood shifts, and a haunting atmosphere throughout. This is in part helped by Steven Wilson's excellent production... not too clean, and not too muddy... the guitars are all layered perfectly. <br />One key word for this album is ATMOSPHERE. For example, when listening to Harvest, I can't help but to think of fall, greens and browns, and fallen leaves... the song definately has that vibe to it.<br />Bleak is a track that is so epic, heavy, and melodic at the same time... an instant classic. Dirge For November is one of my favorite songs EVER... an amazingly soft and unsettling intro leads into a heavy, dreamlike storm of emotion... listen to both of the guitars at once, its brilliant... the song ends with a minimalist light outro... very effective... and the closer, Blackwater Park, is a 12 minute epic of immense proportions... the song contains a dreamy soft part with some eerie voices passing by in the background... and then hammers away with one of the most massive, intense intense riffs ever... and all hell breaks loose for the rest of the song, which results in an exhausting, intense end like nothing else.<br />As for that recent review by parabolak, why wouldn't you want to have these two styles of melody and aggresion blended together? It works so well, and it has been proven with albums like this... If you admit that you are not a fan of either styles of metal, then why should you bother going on about how YOU feel they don't go well together?<br />This album gets my vote for greatest album of all time. I know people throw that around a lot, but I really mean it. I absolutely love music, and no album has touched me or affected me quite as much as this one has. I know it has for many people. Maybe it will do the same to you.
B00007BH5C|5.0|Some may call me biased (I am a huge LOTR fan) but I think that anyone who enjoys classical music, and even many who don't, can enjoy this soundtrack. I loved the FOTR music, and find it very hard to pick a favourite between the two. TTT is more epic and sweeping, with very strong, dramatic themes running through. It introduces the Rohan theme, and you can imagine the expanive fields and rolling hills. The solo violin is just beautiful.<br />Frodo and Sam's journey is continued with dark, creeping themes, that characterise the new addition of Gollum. The sountrack reaches a climax with the battle of the Hornburg at Helms Deep, then draws to a close with the emotional 'Samwise the Brave' and ends with 'Gollums song' (an eerie and mysterious piece of music, that plays as the credits roll in the film. Emiliana Torrini provides the vocals, she is perfect for it with her haunting voice.) No matter how many times I listen to this cd, I don't get bored with it. It just gets better and better.  <BR>Favourite tracks: The passage of the marshes (really spooky)<BR>                  The king of the golden hall<BR>                  Evenstar (beautiful)<BR>                  The white rider (Gandalfs return-loud and <BR>                  dramatic choral pieces)<BR>                  Gollums song

B000002UDB|5.0|I really hesitated writing a review of this album.  Certainly there are more than enough reviews here on Amazon to help make-up someone's mind about whether you would want to get a copy. However, as a very long time fan of the Beatles I feel that if someone is looking for the essence of the late 1960's Beatles there are two songs on the album that are must-listen/must-have; Strawberry Fields and Penny Lane (they may even be the two best Beatles songs).  Each presents a different perspective of growing-up in Liverpool in the early 1950s;  Lennons SF  - pensive, murky, lonely, chaotic;  McCartney PL - upbeat,  odd happenings, a sense of community, the essential English quirky characters.  Taken as a whole, the melancholy bittersweet of SF - offset by the optimistic positive PL demonstrates so well the interplay between the two personalities and how much these two song writing geniuses needed each other to achieve their creative visions.  According to Beatle historians by the time of MMTs recording, neither Lennon or McCartney were still co-writing songs with each other but undoubtly (as can be heard on the Beatles Anthology) each were using the other (also Ringo, George, and not least George Martin) as a sounding board as they worked on the song arrangements, lyrics, etc while recording.  Would I consider MMT to be a must have?  Yes.  While it may not be in the same league as Abbey Road, Rubber Soul or Revolver, your collection would be incomplete without including these two gems.
B00006LLLN|5.0|This is a must have, however, it doesn't compare the true feeling of the live show.  I just saw them live a week before I received the CD.  While musically this is a great piece, it doesn't capture how engaging the band is live.  They had the crowd laughing as much as clapping.<br />I'll be listening to this for years in my car, but can't wait for the DVD for the house.

B00008OLYN|5.0|This is certainly not a typical Opeth release.  Damnation, their new album, was originally designed as the artistic counterpart for Deliverance, the heaviest album of their career. This album fully showcases Opeth's acoustic side, displaying heavy electric guitars on only a few occasions.  Just like Amazon's editorial review says - Opeth is very influenced by Camel and other 70's and 80's progressive acts.<br />As for the ups and downs of the music itself - this album ebbs and flows very well, just like any other Opeth album.  The music fits together in one big logical structure and it is a great album to listen to.  Akerfeldt's voice is as good as it has ever been.....he always fits the music perfectly and shows a great amount of emotion in his singing.  This album met my high expectations.<br />So, for those of you expecting a heaping serving of death metal - go buy Deliverance.  If you want to listen to some great and moving music, buy this album right now.

B00008S2VG|3.0|So I was getting more and more excited about the album as the days went on until the release day.  First I got the single, then I saw the \\"unedited\\" video online, then I say the \\"edited for Americans\\" edition of the video... then I was beginning to wonder, \\"what happened?\\"  Madonna's albums of late have been pretty danceable and upbeat... American Life finds Madonna more introspective, reflective, and a whole lot of depressed.  The lyrics on the album are amazing, but the click and pop of Mirwais is tired....  I wish Madonna sought out a more diverse collection of producers for the album, then it would have been BRILLIANT!!!  Unfortunately, the album is not one of her best, but the next level of her expertise in the music world....<BR>This album will shock at first and then once you listen to the lyrics and forget about the music, it will reveal a very mature Madonna who has grown with the times.  As she said, she believes her audience has grown with her and realizes what she is doing....  Some of us did grow, but unfortunately, I don't think enough if us will realize the relevance of this album until it's too late....

B000063DIR|1.0|At least the signature riff of this album is still intact.  Lee Kerslake's killer opening drum intro to \\"Over The Mountain\\" remains in all its glory.  The riff is followed by a sloppy, obvious edit and then it's onto the inferior overdubbed drums and bass.  Did the Osbournes truly think they were going to fool anyone with this nonsense, let alone Kerslake himself or any rock drummer on the planet?  Lee, I say you and Bob continue the good fight and get what's owed you.  Your drumming is still on this record, try as the Osbournes might to repeatedly deceive us, Ozzy's true and now former fans.<br />There is an informative and interesting article on the debacle that has become this record.  Since Amazon guidelines prohibit including URL's, do an online search for a review of \\"Blizzard Of Ozz\\" and \\"Diary Of A Madman\\".  I have no affiliation with the website or writer, I simply believe the word needs to get out.

B00005JLRT|4.0|\\"Nemesis\\" kept up the tradition of the even-numbered films being better than their odd-numbered counterparts.  <br />Before I continue, I must say that if you grew up on TOS like me, it more than likely won't beat out \\"Khan.\\"  Nothing will, case closed.  I'd put it behind \\"First Contact\\" and ahead of the other two films for sure.<br />Contrary to what others have stated, it is NOT the worst film.  Anyone else recall that debacle known as \\"The Final Frontier?\\"  Its low ticket sales don't do it justice (USA Today had even touted it as getting around the [money amount]-mark...maybe a kiss of death, I don't know).<br />It does succeed in coming full circle with regards to some of the characters we met on the pilot.  Troi and Riker have some kind of past together in the show, and that's finally brought to a close in this movie with their wedding.  Data's desire to be human is met (according to some of his friends).  Last it shows that this crew has grown closer together as a family, in contrast to the beginning when hardly anyone knew each other, and Picard seemed to be pretty stuffy.<br />The movie I think follows a blueprint of Star Trek VI.  Almost everyone gets one last moment to shine, \\"let's make peace with an enemy,\\" etc.<br />Yes, it does have its flaws, but if you're more into movies for the content rather than worrying if Picard was truly bald during his academy days, or some other tidbit, check out the movie.

But even that didn't detract from the power of this film.<br />This Hammer horror version sticks fairly closely to Stoker's original novel, and as such is a purist's dream.<br />By now almost everybody knows the plot - Jonathan Harker goes to Transylvannia to cement a property deal for a landed gent looking to move to England, but ends up being held hostage in Dracula's high castle with some very buxom \\"ladies\\" of the night.<br />Meanwhile a boat comes ashore in a storm at Whitby, strangely devoid of life.

6304539258|5.0|Watching this again recently I was struck by the traditional nature of the story telling. The film may be hi-tech, but the narrative is rooted long in the past. In particular, I noted several parallels between Star Wars and the plot of current blockbuster, Lord of the Rings.<br />Consider the similarities;<br />- Both Luke and Frodo have to leave their hearth and home to fight a menace they know little about<br />- Both are accompanied by companions who are steadfast and true, and just quirky enough to provide light relief after moments of high tension. In Luke's case he has the droids with their whistles and strange sounding voices, while Frodo has the slightly rustic Sam and the younger, enthusiastic Hobbits.<br />- Both come under the wing of old, swami-like tutors with strong mystical powers, a cantankerous nature and who are prone to say things like &quot;It is your destiny&quot; and &quot;The darkness is seductive&quot;. And both mentors disappear out of the story just as our hero needs them the most.<br />- Both Luke and Frodo enter a bar filled with a strange amalgam of creatures from different places where people talk in strange tongues and where they meet a strong enigmatic man whose destiny is linked with theirs - Luke meets Han, Frodo meets Strider<br />- Both have something in their past that returns to provide a focal point in the story. With Frodo it is the ring left to him by Bilbo, with Luke it is his relationship with Vader, and the light sabre that Obi-Wan gives him.<br />-At the pivotal point in both stories, the hero stands alone with his fear, facing his greatest trial, before finally prevailing.<br />- And overriding the whole thing in both stories is the battle betwen the forces of light and darkness.<br />There are many more parallels but I don't want to give away too much plot on the off-chance that there's someone on the planet who hasn't seen it yet, But if you look you'll find other aspects of traditional storytelling lurking in the film, including some that have parallels, not in LOTR, but in traditional folk tales. Rescuing princesses, finding out about your true parentage and learning from wizened creatures in dank forests have all been standard fare for heroes for thousands of years.<br />I think that's the genius of it, and what made it such a must-see movie. It speaks to us in strong archetypes, with characters and situations we recognise from fairy tales from our childhood. Tolkein knew the power of the old stories, and drew heavily on them, and so too does George Lucas.<br />I just wonder if he read LOTR at an impressionable age?the film, including some that have parallels, not in LOTR, but in traditional folk tales.

006016848X|5.0|I attended a speach by Mr. Gray recently in NY -- he is as exciting in person, as he is in writing. The book is informative, lively written and an excellent guide for both genders. As I examine myself and my relationships, I certainly encounter many of the gender-specific traits that Mr. Gray describes.<br />While one may argue that the descriptions are stereotypical, I believe they are nonetheless notable and make communication and interaction easier.
B0000028PI|5.0|Man, is this a great album!  This would have certainly been a major hit like Trash for Alice, but the timing was wrong.  In 94, the whole Nirvana/Pearl Jam/Soundgarden Seattle thing was still in full swing, and no one had the time of day for an old fogey like Alice Cooper.  Too bad, coz obviously alot of work and talent went into this and it went by pretty much unnoticed.  Alice's albums vary, but there's something so unique and different about this one.  I can't quite put my finger on what it is, but it's one of a kind.  It's actually pretty Savatage-ish.  It's also very solid, no filler.  Alice must have been very inspired, and the collaboration with Neil Gaiman was a nice touch.  I wish more people would have known about this coz it really puts Trash to shame.  It's really worth your time.
B00008973Q|3.0|I just got this yesterday and immediately stuck it in the player. I have to agree with the last reviewer; I was disappointed in the the picture on this disc. I was looking forward to it after the distastrous previous edition, but this picture seems both fuzzy and unnaturally colored. The green of the grass seemed unearthly. Many of the colors seem extremely bright. I skipped around in the first commentary track and that sounded very enjoyable, and of course this is one of the most wonderful films ever made, so if you have not seen it, you better. I am surprised to hear praise of this new DVD presentation. It makes me wonder if some discs are better than others?
B00008OLYN|5.0|exquisite. opeth can bring the pain with a hammer or a feather. this is their best yet.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I could not wait for the new CD to come out. What a disappointment when all of the tracks sounded like everyother album they have done. Some of the base was way too loud. Sorry, I guess I like their older stuff better.
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album of Madonna is excellent!!! All the songs are great. If you love her, you will love this cd. American life is the album of the year!!!
0688170528|5.0|I gave The Pact five starts because it had a very good topic and it relates very well to various situations that different aged people go through. The book was set up in a weird way, at first it was kind of hard to figure out where the story was going and who was the narrorator. I like the way the story twisted in all directions throughout the whole book. I liked The Pact a lot because it was a page turner with new information that we didn't know before one every page. Once I started reading this book I didn't want to put it down.
B00006HBUA|1.0|This project truly had potential, but it fails.  Matthew Lillard is the perfect Shaggy and the production design could have worked, but in an effort to update the Scooby genre for today's audiences, the writers have hijacked this franchise for some very unfamiliar territory.<br />The original SD stuff was about being scared and solving a mystery.  This stinker of a film tries to cash-in on the retro-feel of the characters and make this into some Austin Powers wanna-be.  This movie is never scary and it actually is never funny either.<br />By making the monsters real, the whole fun and innocence of the original series is lost.  The original characters were debunkers, not super-heroes on a journey of self-discovery.<br />The film comes across as mindless as a \\"Gilligan's Island\\" episode but not nearly as fun.<br />They don't even get the jargon right -- it's the \\"Mystery Machine\\" not the \\"Mystery Van.\\"<br />Again, it could have been fun and even a little scary, but this production is too interested in FX and being retro.  It just doesn't work.<br />Perhaps if they had made a more gothic haunted house mystery, like the trailer and the animated opening sequence suggested, it would have worked better and been truer to audience expectations.  To have Scrappy-Doo as the villain may have worked better in a later movie installment.  I fear they have left little room for a sequel -- such a pity!!!!
0446608955|5.0|I liked when Landon and Jamie became friends.  But when he acted like he wasn't friends with her around his own frinds, I thought that was rude.  Landon has a life full of problems, but he learns to get pass them, which is is good.  Jamie is a nice girl throughtout the whole book.  She helps others and gives to charity.  At Christmas time Landon does a really nice thing for the kids at the orphange.  At the end of the book it becomes sad.  Overall, this was a very good book.  By far, the best I have ever read.
0385504209|4.0|If you've read one, you've read 'em both! That's how I feel about \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and Dan Brown's similar \\"Angels and Demons.\\" These books are parallel in so many ways that it is almost ridiculous: an \\"expert\\" gets murdered in a bizarre, cruel fashion; the beautiful daughter of the \\"expert\\" searches for the killer by hooking up with a Harvard professor; there is much religious symbolism; there is a cruel, unstoppable assassin who takes orders from a cruel, all-knowing unidentified director; there are challenging puzzles for the protagonaist to solve (in \\"Da Vinci\\" at least the reader gets to play along); there is cliffhanger after improbable cliffhanger; etc.; etc.; etc.<br />However, all this is not to say that both books are not great reads, wildly entertaining, and frankly, very interesting, in their revelations about the Holy Grail and the Knights Templar(\\"Da Vinci\\") and the Illuminati (\\"Angels\\"). I recommend both books, but you really only have to read one
B00008DDSC|5.0|I've never seen a movie like this.  Amid the Dominant/submissive theme is a touching love story between 2 interesting characters.
6305076995|5.0|A great work of art to be viewed, shared, and placed in a time capsule... oh wait a minute, that won't be necessary as this<BR>concert footage has been restored and archived onto DVD.<BR>Any fan of the old YES, [no offense to the newer 80's YES music]<BR>should get this DVD while they can.  Although i have only just recently seen them [Anderson, Wakeman, Howe, Squire, White] in concert, I now have a better grasp of what their live shows were like when that classic music of theirs was still fresh. Great camera work.. it almost qualifies as a guitar lesson with Steve Howe.
B00008J2DQ|3.0|One thing I will say about Godsmack is that they are more interesting than your average Nu-metal/Rap-rock band out today.  They manage to seem fresh when they haven't changed much at all.  They stay true to their influences:  Metallica and Alice in Chains, two bands whose greatness they'll probably never reach, but trying to makes them a better band.  They are the ONLY rock band today using solos in their songs.  Songs like &quot;Voodoo&quot; and its cousins &quot;Spiral&quot; and &quot;Serenity&quot; give Godsmack a dimension that no one else has.<br />With all that said, this is a band that could be a lot better.  Every song begins with some 3 or 4 power chord riff in Drop-D tuning, and despite adding a few bells and whistles, that formula hasn't changed much since the first album.  &quot;I Stand Alone&quot; showed some progress, but nothing here seems to further that progression.  &quot;Re-align&quot; sounds nice, and the solo lasts longer that Godsmack solos usually do.  &quot;Straight out of Line&quot; isn't as memorable as &quot;Keep Away&quot; or &quot;Greed&quot;, but its respectable.<br />They really need to be more creative with their main riffs, such as using single note parts like in &quot;I Stand Alone&quot;, vary their tempos more, and maybe put more spacing in the riffs rather than wait untill the interlude.  Still, this is a band that is much more creative than, say, Linkin Park.
B00003CX9E|5.0|I had heard about this film all of my life, but it wasn't until my Senior year in college that I actually watched it for the first time in a film class. I was literally blown away. Not only is the story extremely interesting, but the film techniques used will delight your eyes! I've always been a lover of film and how their made and put together, and \\"Citizen Kane\\" is the epitome of what a good movie is.<br />Orson Welles' direction of this film is immaculate, especially for someone who was so young when he directed it! You will immediately be drawn into all of the characters in this film. I would highly suggest \\"Citizen Kane\\" to any and everyone!!! If you want to watch a captivating and cinematically beautiful piece of filmmaking, watch this film!!!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Yup, she has done it again!  Of course, if you're into her recent electronica genre.  I know many of the old-skool Madonna fans kind of got lost with her transition through the years, but I have personally evolved with her and her different musical styles.  The album has a very similar sound to &quot;Music&quot;, but overall I'd say I like &quot;American Life&quot; a bit better.
B00005JLSC|2.0|Chicagos commentary-like cynicism manages to squeeze its way between the lines of the film while its rare moments of dialogue compete with the well-choreographed dance numbers in an interesting manner that is all but captivating. Of course the movie has a cynical, you-only-get-one-moment-of-fame essence, along with emotional insight on the media circus mentality that has existed...well...existed forever. Nice sentiment, but one I already knew. The question is, Why would I care? And how could I become emotionally attached in any way to characters whose sole function is to whine, backstab, murder, profit...and, oh yes, dance. Musnt forget that one. It isnt that Chicago is a bad movie and it is obviously an expertly performed musical. The only problem is, it just isnt my style. As the second of the first two big film musicals in years, Chicago will forever be compared to Baz Luhrmans Moulin Rouge. Similar in outward context, the films are utterly different. Last words of advice? If you hated Moulin Rouge, check out this one. Youll love it!
B00003CX9Q|5.0|I could not believe how great this movie could be On DVD there was so much to watch an watching all the actors shareing their past moments together was just great this is one DVD that I will hold on to for a long time , if you do not have a copy Please get one you want be sorry when you see how much this DVD has on it, it's worth every sent .
B000002L61|5.0|I love this album and i cant believe the guys are still together! This is an old album but its really good. If your a Classic Metal fan check out Dio! The best track is The Last In Line...Its old but it still sends a rush throug you body!
B00008S2VG|4.0|Very rarely can an artist successful stretch a music carrer through three decades. Madonna is one of those artists. As we watched her grow, shock and surprise music fans & critics alike for years, she has provided us with album after album filled with hits and inspirational and uplifting lyrics.<br />American Life may lyrically be Madonna's best album. The introspective look into the singer's life is fantastic. She address the media's portrayl of perfection in entertainment on the album's title track, her relationship with god on \\"X-static Process\\", her love for her husband \\"Nothing Fails\\" & the truth about the corruption of the business on \\"Hollywood\\".<br />Her casting of producer Mirwais Ahmadzai on this album, as well as 2000's Music, shows that the two have some more collaborations inside of them. \\"Die Another Day\\" from the James Bond film of the same name is welcomed on here, as are the stunning ballads \\"Easy Ride\\" & \\"Intervention\\". With the exception of \\"Mother & Father\\" the album is a fantastic straight through listen.<br />Madonna continues to prove that she is the real deal and that she will not be held down by this industry and that she won't be held in any boundries. This album shows that musically Madonna is still a genius and that she still has a great deal of material that she wants to share with the world.
B000001C6M|5.0|This is an incredible debut! Songs like Evil Has NO Boundries, The Anti-Christ, Die By The Sword, And Crionics are some of the best songs i've ever heard by Slayer! Toms Voice sounds different on this album but it sounds good! All the Slayers are good but this is the best next to God Hates Us All!!!
B000002U82|5.0|Obviously, this is a classic from Pink Floyd. It's great from start to finish. There are two instrumental songs, but they both still manage to sound good. Time and Breathe can sound depressing, but thats Pink Floyd sometimes.<BR>    My most favorite song is Brain Damage which is definetely the smartest song on the whole album. BEAUTIFULLY DONE!
B000002JOH|5.0|When i listen to Pantera it sents a rush through me making me want to do whats on the cover!! Dimebags riffs are incredible Phils voice is good, the whole album is awesome!!!! The day i hear a bad album by Pantera will be the day I kill myself! ...Hostile send the biggest rush!!! But all of them do!
B000084T18|1.0|after listening to this album, i am convinced 50's IQ doesn't peak beyond 95. if you like dumb lyrics and less than substantive music, than this album is for you.
B000002H33|5.0|This is my favorite Metallica cd. It was Metallica when they were still Metallica. Dont get me wrong, i like the &quot;new&quot; metallica, but i wish they were still thrash metal instead of what they are now. I cant wait to St. Anger comes out but back to Master Of Puppets. Battery is an awesome opening song and Master Of Puppets is one of the best Met song ever. Welcome Home is awesome, Leper Messiah Is probaly my favorite song on the album. Orion is an awesome insrtumental song and Damge Inc is a great ending song. If you dont already own this cd and your a Metallica fan buy this cd.
0385504209|4.0|Dan Brown has crafted a good page turner.  Though burdened a bit with loads of historical and cryptographic references, it is nonetheless a fairly brisk read.  Dragging the reader through breathless chases around Paris and London, the author has obviously done his homework and keeps the reader engaged by cleverly switching through multiple intertwined story lines.  I have to admit the identity of the main culprit was rather surprising, but the ending left me a little disappointed.  Bringing closure to such a sensitive subject probably makes the chosen ending an obvious conclusion.  The questions explored in the novel are not for the religiously narrow minded.  Overall, a good work.
B000063DFQ|4.0|During the 80's I used music as an identity. I explored many different types of music from Def Leppard to Stray Cats; eventually I stumbled upon this album, when an album was really vinyl. <br />To this day it has remained on my personal all-time top 10, which says a lot considering I own over 500 CD's with original release dates from the 1950's to 2003 !!
B00005QAPH|5.0|It's easy to see Guido Anselmi, the lead character in 8 1/2, as Federico Fellini himself. The movie is easier to understand if you realize this movie is essentially about itself. Quite a departure from Fellini's work in the 50s, such as the mesmerizing Nights of Cabiria. With 8 1/2, he embraced a much more fanciful surrealistic style, later to be dubbed &quot;Fellini-esque&quot;. It's a much more imaginative and cinematic style than the earlier neo-realist style. It allows us to really get inside the head of Guido (and Fellini also). We witness his dreams, his fantasies, his frustrations, his memories, his ideas, all in vivid carnivalesque vignettes. The opening sequence features Guido stuck in a traffic jam, then climbing out of his car and flying away in the sky. He flies far above a beach almost like a kite, with a rope attached to his leg held by one of his associates. Then he is pulled back down to earth by the rope and promptly returns to reality. This sequence sets the tone for the film. Guido drifts back and forth in between fantasy and reality. Perhaps to escape the frustrations of being unable to make his next film, of dealing with his producers, or of dealing with the women in his life. However, he never manages to escape for long without being pulled back down to earth by his problems. <br />It's a scenario that we can all relate to. The reason that we go to movies in the first place is to escape from our everyday problems and concerns. This is Guido's (and Fellini's) predicament: that he can't even escape from his own concerns long enough to create a film, so that his viewers can escape theirs. Fellini, however, was able to take this predicament and make it into his film. The result is probably the most clever and complex film about filmmaking ever made.<br />This can be a bit daunting to a first time viewer. 8 1/2, I think, is a film that you really have to grow into. It takes multiple viewings to really get a good grasp of everything that's going on.And with each viewing, you should notice something new and catch on to the many complexities of the film. I will admit that I have not completely grasped all the meanings of this profound film, but it's a joy to experience even if you absorb only a little. The combination of the images and Nino Rota's music and Fellini's dazzling photography makes for quite an experience.  <br />The Criterion DVD is definitely one to pick up. I haven't seen all the extra material on the disc, but the movie itself looks superb. The picture quality is really astounding. I saw 8 1/2 on an old VHS tape a while back and this DVD looks much, much better! It's a clean, detailed picture that really brings out the beauty of the black and white photography. The picture is also enhanced for 16:9 TVs. Film lovers should definitely have this disc in their collection.
0679720200|4.0|The Stranger (or the Outsider depending on translation) is a novel that will make you question your life, how you live it and the reason for it. Although written in the 1940's its content is still totally relevant today and allows the reader a bitter- sweet read through Camus' use of simple yet decadent language. <BR>The main protagonist Meursault lives his life by the sun, but circumstances push him closer to the death that he has spent all of his life living for. The novel is entirely ambiguous but this is what makes it such a fascinating read as each reader interprets the text differently to satisfy their own personal self. Camus leaves us questioning all aspects of life including mortality, nature, religion, society, love and hate with all of these themes combining to make The Stranger a thought provoking yet depressive novel that must be read.
B00008OLYN|5.0|For all fans of the softer interludes and passages residing in most opeth albums, especially still life and blackwater park, I highly recommend this cd. Hypnotic, trance-inducing, psychedelic, emotional... Simply put, this album is an incredible testament to the musicianship, eclectic nature, and overall genious of this band, possibly the most talented progressive outfit in music as a whole. Fans of opeth, pink floyd and 70's progressive/psychedelic please, i beg u buy this cd. It will become one of yer most cherished. An absolute and amazingly beautiful 40+ minutes of mind tripping sonic bliss. Music lovers take note, if like me and u are into everything from soilent green, cryptopsy, and dying fetus to soulive, medeski martin and wood, and 70's era miles, to the roots,  then this needs not to be passed over!
6305075492|3.0|I am not sure if people realize this.  But this movie's theme and look is reproduced in Anne rice's movie adaption of Queen of the Damned. It is used as one of the vampire lestat's music video's (FORSAKEN)featured at the beginning of the film. The  music video version is very gothic and vamperic. I really like the darkness surrounding the films concept. I just recently orderd it and can not wait to see this movie. It looks awesome for a silent film.
6304362498|5.0|The movie 1984 is as dark and foreboding as Orwell's original book. John Hurt and Richard Burton depict Winston and O'Brien well. Hamilton makes for an excellent Julia. The performances of these actors make this film believable and quite effective. There are some great lines in this movie. The dialogue between Hurt and Burton towards the end might make you cringe (given the setting) but it is memorable.<br />The screenplay follows the book closely, and focuses on the most important passages, a necessity due to the time constraints of any movie. This movie is long, but how could one make a short version of this story worth watching? The lighting and soundtrack add to the atmosphere or dread and gloom.<br />The messages conveyed by the book emerge from the dialogue and performance of the actors. The sets it was filmed on match this mood aptly. This is a rare instance where the movie version of a great story is as worthwhile as the book it drew upon. Though it is depressing, it is a profound and unique film that all who appreciate fine cinematography should watch.
0156027321|5.0|\\"Life of Pi\\" is simply great.  There isn't another way to say it.  Everything about it is beautiful.  While it may seem simple, its is complex.  While it is complicated, it is truly very simple.  <br />Don't get what the heck I just said?  Then read \\"Life of Pi\\".<br />\\"Life of Pi\\" was written in simple form: the novel is very straightforward in terms of word and sentence structure.  But the way symbols are used and connections are made is astonishing.  For days, maybe weeks, after I read \\"Life of Pi\\" I would think: \\"Oh my God!  That chapter connected with another chapter!  That gives an entirely new prespective!\\" and other thoughts of that nature (everyone followed by an awed \\"wow\\").<br />The highest honor a book can acheive is to make the reader think.  \\"Life of Pi\\" certainly acheives this goal.
0880793589|5.0|As a member of a corporate creative team, we need all the tools we can find to boost creative thinking.  This one won't disappoint you!
B0000630BT|4.0|I guess you could say this album is borderline thrash/speed metal. When I first previewed this album, the title track blew me away! Judas Priest always was a define classic metal band, though this album does show some flavor of speed. The songs are fast, furious, and heavy. The blistering title track is my favorite. \\"Metal Meltdown\\" contains their best guitar solo ever! \\"Night Crawler\\" is an interesting display of melody and metal to perfection with a steady beat. Scott Travis' drumming is sensational. He is much better then Dave Holland, and it's a shame that this would be the only superior album with him. <br />The only thing that I find upsetting about this album is that every song seems like a carbon copy of another. \\"All Gun Blazing\\" sounds fast and furious like the title track, and \\"Night Crawler\\" sounds like a slowed down version of \\"All Guns Blazing.\\" Regardless, this is an excellent album. It is defining moment of Judas Priest's career, and the last with Rob Halford.
B000069AUI|5.0|Sure the song Yellow off of their first album Parachutes caught my eye, and as did the song Trouble, however it did not convince me enough to buy the cd. However, after hearing In My Place off of their second album A Rush of Blood to the Head, i realized that Coldplay was certainly no one hit wonder. I purchased the album and played it through once and had my breath taken away. After hearing the entire cd i didnt feel that there were any songs that were throwaways. It is very important that i can play the entire cd through without skipping around. Coldplay has simply created a masterpiece with this album. Politik immediately gets you hooked in and it only gets better from then on. 'God put a smile upon your face' is a true work of art. Chris Martin pours his heart into his emotion-filled lyrics and you can see exactly how he felt when writing. The mix of piano and guitar is capturing along with powerful drum beats that fit perfectly. This album is simply flawless. With the powerful lyrics and flowing catchy rhythms, no album can top this one. It is simply a masterpiece and Coldplay should be incredibly proud of themselves.
B000069HK2|5.0|I first heard The Used on MTV2 with &quot;A Box Full of Sharp Objects&quot;. I was in love with that song man. And then to hear &quot;The Taste of Ink&quot;, I was blown away! Awesome band man, I hope to see them at warped tour! GREAT CD! YOU MUST BUY! I wonder if Kelly still dates Bert? ha<br />Does it say much that I'm usually a really critical listener?
B00008PW3Q|4.0|... you would think people would realish a -BAND- with such talent.  Song writing and musicianship seems to have been totally cast aside by the masses.  It is great to have one of the best songwriting bands return.  This band clearly seems to have an edge on this album.   Sure everyone misses christine but they are clearly moving in the right direction.  Does anyone remember Peter Green? The band also plays ther own instruments  which is rare in this day.  Rock on.....
B00008S2VG|5.0|This is her best album in many a years, because it cuts to the point, is very catchy and very fresh.It is her most honest album without being boring. Songs like Hollywood and  Nothing Fails will become classics and who on earth would be able to turn a song about her dead mother into the meanest beat. Whilst at first the album seems like the work of a child, it is actually a very polished off accomplishment. Very layerd and a darn good listen.
B000000WJK|3.0|If you like shoegazing music, you'll like this.  If you like the strong melodies and lyrics of the Bittersweet Symphony era Verve, this is a little disappointing.  Ashcroft's voice is washed out with deep reverbs and McCabe's guitars are similarly muddied.  Not a bad album, but definitely not a great one.  I'd rather listen to a Ride or My Bloody Valentine album for this type of music.
B000069AUI|4.0|Music this mellow usually doesn't grab me that much, but this one just kinda drew me in.  The melodies, infectious piano riffs, solid vocals, and smooth overall sound make this album what it is.  It has a dreamy effect, but it's catchy and interesting enough not to put you asleep.  I've known of the group since hearing Yellow and Trouble from their first album Parachutes, and while I thought they were decent tunes, they didn't grab me like when I heard Clocks on the radio the other day...what an awesome piano riff.  And after listening to the other songs, I wasn't disappointed...the only track I don't care for is A Whisper...but 10 out of 11 ain't bad...check this out!
B00005RYKV|1.0|Seriously, the first review with this title nailed it.  I saw a different Takeshi Kitano movie a few years back which was much more stylistically interesting (can't remember the name, but it was a Japanese film), so I know he's capable of making an interesting film.  This isn't it.  This film is a terrible waste of time.
B0000007BI|4.0|This version of Mozarts Requiem is one of the best I have heard in a long time. Although it was recorded with period instruments, it is a great version.  It has a wonderful sound quality to the CD and the singers sound absolutely angelic and smooth.  You can feel Mozart's terror when he was writing this piece.  It is an incredibly emmotional experience and this CD was well recorded. The singers voices are very excellent and clear. I recommend this version of Requiem, especially if this is your first time listening or buying Requiem.
B000069AUI|4.0|You've heard 'Clocks' about a billion times by now.  If you like that, you'll like this.  If you like Radiohead, you'll like this.  Melodic, interesting music with slightly obscure lyrics- they'd didn't break a lot of new ground, but it's a solid album.
B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna takes a crack at rapping in \\"American Life\\". To demonstrate her gangsta tendencies and secure a coveted Parental Advisory stamp, she tosses \\"F...it\\" into the chorus -- scared of that. These tracks will surely spark heated debate over which is weaker -- her vocal ability or her lyrics. Is it any wonder the CD liner features Madonna spelling out her name and the CD title cheerleader style (albeit a cheerleader with an AK-47) rather than listing the song lyrics? Big yawn.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Whenever a major star sticks his or her neck out and makes a statement against materialism - it is an important occasion. <br />Like it or not, it's a moment that will be remembered many years from now, for better or for worse.<br />In this case - I hope it's for the better.<br />I was really disappointed with the album when I first heard it off The Leak.  Decided to buy the album anyway, and boy am I'm glad I did.<br />This has to be Madonna's most 'complete' sounding album in more than a decade - since Like A Prayer.  <br />Don't get me wrong.  I adore most of her work on her last two studio albums.  But somehow, whenever I listen to them, I keep getting this feeling that the good bits are constantly interrupted by the throwaway bits.  <br />They feel unfinished. They came across like two high concept albums with a few key tracks, and a lot of distracted crowd pleasers.<br />Thankfully, American Life didn't fall into that category. The album sounds very cohesive.<br />Lyrically, it may not be Madonna's best work.  We've had better. But here's what's important, the songs sound sincere.  They didn't come across as if she's trying to be too clever, or trying too hard.<br />More imporantly, we got to listen to her voice.   It's right there, up front and centre.  And she sounds lovely. There's this uplifting hint of new found joy and humility.  That makes the listening experience so much more enjoyable.<br />On the downside, the soundscape she has chosen to operate within this time round has become a tad stale.  A couple of the songs sounded like extensions of Impressive Instant - an overlooked gem from the Music album.<br />The weakest song on the album has to be the title track.  It does grow on you.  But after awhile, you can't help but wonder why she chose the song as the lead-off single when there are stronger contenders on the album.<br />Some critics have been giving Madonna a hard time for attempting to rap.  Should we blame Eminem? But hang on - she did it 11years ago, on Vogue. Didn't we lap it up back then? And what of Justify My Love, and the entire Erotica album?<br />As for the inclusion of Die Another Day - musically, it made perfect sense, coming after Mother And Father.  The songs flowed into each other.<br />And honestly, when was the last time Madonna closed the album with a stunner? Ten years ago? Maybe more?<br />What we have here is a fascinating album, which gets better with each listen. But it risks being under appreciated because of Madonna's anti-war stance.<br />Wonder why the single's not getting as much airplay in the U.S?  I believe the folks at Clear Channel Communications may have a clue.
B00005JLRT|1.0|I've been a Trek fan since the Original Series, seen all the movies, all the television series. This was the greatest disappointment I've had in a Star Trek motion picture. A horrible way to end the Next Generation franchise, and quite possibly the end to the entire Trek lineage.
B00005JKZV|5.0|On December 18, 2002, I was at the movie theatre to see the opening of The Two Towers. Being a Tolkien fan, I feel that movie adaptations are usually [bad], because they stray so far from the books. After seeing what Jackson did with Fellowship, I had high hopes for the Two Towers.<br />Tolkien fans/purists will understand me when I say that my jaw dropped to the floor when the Elves showed up at Helm's Deep, Faramir said, \\"The ring will go to Gondor,\\" and when the Ents decided not to go to war, and then 'hastily' changed their minds at the last minute. To those of you unfamiliar with the novels, I'll just say that these three events occurred exactly the opposite in the movie of the way they occurred in the book.<br />I was put out, and rather distraught with Two Towers having seen the amazing degree to which Jackson had adapted Fellowship. Certainly, the first movie left out parts of the book, but other than the minor character change (Glorfindel/Arwen), I don't remember things happening exactly opposite to the way they did in the book. I felt like the few things that Jackson left out and omitted in the first movie did not change the themes from Tolkien's work, whereas the changes in The Two Towers did.<br />However, after seeing The Two Towers a second time, then a third time, and finally a fourth time, my opinions have changed. I realized that the movie adaptation was just that: an adaptation, not a photocopy of the book put onto film. I also realized that the things changed only changed temporarily, not permanently.<br />In The Lord of the Rings books, Tolkien has nearly 2000 pages (not including appendices) to completely develop his characters. Characters are made interesting by the degree to which they change. That being said, Tolkien's character's dynamism is far more subtle than Jackson's, but that is simply the way a movie works: the action is much quicker than in a book.<br />When Faramir decides to take the ring, I thought his character was ruined...but then I changed my mind. In order to emphasize Faramir's doubt and final resolution, they had him change his mind after a great conflict. In the end, his character has the same mindset as Faramir's character has in the book. In the book, Tolkien emphasizes that the time of the Elves is over, and that the age of men is soon to begin. Thus, he has them win the Battle of Helm's deep by themselves (not outnumbered too terribly). When I first saw the elves at Helm's deep, I thought that that emphasis on the strength of men was ruined. But, if you look closely, there are no elves left in the morning...only the men lasted the night, and only the men led the final charge that won the battle. And, also, if you go back and read the books, the Ents do change their minds rather quickly, and they do resolve at first (at entmoot) not to go to war.<br />Purists: remember, it's not the books. It's a movie. And, the movie does a darned good job of emphasizing the themes of the book; it just employs different devices to obtain that emphasis. From a Tolkien fan's standpoint, The Two Towers was just as good as The Fellowship of the Ring. From a movie standpoint, this one was far better than the first. It has action, suspense, comic relief, drama, romance, and the best musical score of 2002. The acting and cinematography are brilliant: Jackson will go down in history as one of the greatest directors ever. With Fellowship, I was a purist, and I still am. But this movie is pure: pure movie-making genius. Tolkien is smiling in the Valinor...
B00008S2VG|5.0|It took about 2 good listens before I was hooked; now I have the songs constantly plying in my head.  Madonna takes her listeners on a continuous journey that always peaks our interests. The sound is similar to 80s retro and electronical period - soft and edgy, easy to dance to.  Many of the songs start off mellow and pick up progressively. I'd recommend this CD to both Madonna fans and abroad!
B000002LPH|5.0|I bought the cd this afternoon and i've been listenning to it for more that 6 hours right now without any hesitation. Before I bought it, I had read all those silly reviews on this and all his other albums, and believe me, currently listening the album, I've once again hated all those prejudiced editors, reviewers, and talent lacking musical experts(!). This album, from the beginning to the end, is a masterpiece! A completely soul touching influence, beyond its time, even much better than Mr. McCartney's silly love albums!.. <br />At the first glance, I catch the up-beat disco rhytmn of Love Comes to Everyone. And please look at the time this album was released! 1979.. Right before the world went into heavily shynthisized disco craziness. And see how George's touch changes things. Just don't believe in those people who say that he in fact imitated the musical understanding of the time period this album was released, just to be able to sell more!.. No!.. George was always among the ones to open the path for the future of music. And this fact is once again proved in this case. If only he was the only one to decide!! Popular music today wouldn't have gone far beyond weird, bizzare and crazy!.. Go to a record store and buy an arbitrary album, how many of them can you listen to, without having an aching head in the end, or how many of them would really relax your soul when you feel tense? NO MORE THAN THE FINGERS OF ONE HAND. And would certainly contain his last work \\"Brainwashed\\".<br />Jazzy tracks like \\"Not Guilty\\" and \\"Soft-Hearted Hanna\\" takes your soul to another world with their fantastic arrangement and presentation!.. These pieces are among the strongest tracks on this album which will certainly make you want to listen to it over and over again!.. Those who claim that Sweet-Hearted Hanna is bizzare or strange, just burn all your cds and quit keeping your noses in musical stuff!! Fantastic piece, which will remind you of \\"Ne na na na\\" style jazzy bluesy songs. Would have gone wonderfully in Sgt. Pepper... Paul could only catch this sound with the introductory tracks on \\"Flaming Pie\\" about 20 years after George's work here, and they were not even close!! But when it's Paul doing it, he is the \\"genious\\"(!) and when it's George suddenly things become \\"weird\\"(!). This is not fair! Before listening to this cd, just free your minds, float up stream and leave all your prejudiced thoughts behind!.. I bet you're gonna love it!.. <br />Tell me how many song writers, ever existed, could manage to combine blues and latin riffs as beautifully as we see in \\"Dark Sweet Lady\\"? More than five again? I don't really think so!..<br />I could right now, write a hundred pages about this great album and about musical editors who have never even owned a tiny piece of musical vision, but i guess this much is enough for now!.. Buy it right now, if you can find it anyway, and you'll be glad to have listened to such a fabulous album!.. George's magical touch will surround your body immediately!.. These are what made him George Harrison and those people (you know who they are) are what prevented him from growing much bigger!.. We miss you George!! I wish you were here to continue your fight with all the craziness around by your touching songs. Sooner or later, all the world will understand how important and beautiful all the thing you had done in the past have been, are and are going to be!...
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence rocks! they have one of the best female vocals of the planet, lyrics and music r great. i love this band, not just for Brimg me to life, also for My Inmortal, Tourniquet, Hello, Going Under. They just Rock!
B000003FD9|5.0|I first heard Starker in a live performance in 1965, a memorial concert for one of his cellist colleagues in Sacramento, California.  This recordings are from that period in his life.<br />The program was two of the suites (1 and 5) and the Kodaly sonata, Opus 8.<br />The quality of these recordings is like being there . . . and I WAS there.<br />If you can only own one presentation of the Bach suites, this is, without doubt, THE one.
B00006SFBD|5.0|After hearing a few songs from this album I decided to listen to the whole album, and since have listened to it hundreds of times.  I own all the rest of Opeth's line of CD's and this album does not disappoint in the least, unless you are looking for softer songs perhaps.  All of them alternate between heavy and soft, packed with emotion that makes you just say &quot;hell yeah.&quot;<br />   If you're looking for &quot;ground-breaking&quot; like the guy who posted below, perhaps get &quot;Load&quot; from Metallica - Truly groundbreaking(gag).  This CD was expected to be heavy and has succeeded in that, along with being excellent music that you can listen to over and over.  I can't remember listening to *any* heavy music this much; it just has sticking power, without being too light or too heavy, it fulfills both worlds.<br />   All of Opeth's albums are *awesome* and this one fills the line up.  I recommend Damnation to go with this. :)
B00006CXXU|5.0|First off, this girl can SING her [...] off. Every song is completely different from each other and theres not one song on this album that is a filler. Every song carves their own niche in this album and even with many different types of genres, it all comes together to become one work of art, Stripped.<br />Taking lessons from Madonna, Christina Aguilera has been reinventing herself with every single off of her audacious sophomore album, Stipped. In this album, Christina is doing everything right, choosing music thats true to her heart, real, and raw. Stripped contains song that are true to life and that anyone can relate to. It has something for everyone. R&B fans will groove to the sexy sounds and lyrics of 'Get Mine Get Yours', about casual sex, and the smooth 'Loving Me 4 me', a song about a love that loves a person for who they naturally are. HipHop fans don't fret, Christina has got something for you guys too. 'Dirrty', a hot club song shows that Christina can get down and dirrty as well as any guy, and 'Can't Hold Us Down', a fiery song about the double standards in today's society towards woman, will get you bumping and grinding to their hot beats and up front lyrics. <br />Surprising, Christina wrote all but two songs in this album and was executive producer of this masterpiece. Continuing, Rock fans will get a slap in the face when Christina unleashes 'Fighter' and 'Make Over'. Both with fierce attitude and Christina's never failing, powerful voice. 'Fighter', a song about backstabbing and betrayal by her \\"friends\\" that only led to their demise at the end because their actions only made her a stronger person in the end. 'Make Over', a strike to the music industry trying to change her into something she's not, and it's so apparent in this album that she is finally getting her way and showing us the real Christina. Other highlights includes the incredible 'Beautiful', a beautiful song (no pun intended) about loving yourself no matter what society thinks ofyou. If you want funky 70s music, 'Underappreciated' is a sassy song about a relationship where the other person is taken for granted after a long time of committment. Christina also includes gospel (Soar) an empowering song about believing and trusting in yourself, soul (Keep On Singing My Song) a song where Christina states that she will live her life how she wants to live it, country rock (Cruz) a coming of age song about change, blues (Walk Away & Impossible) about a love that only gives her pain, but can't seem to let go and about a love that won't open up emotionally.  'Infatuation' brings on the latin inside Christina, a song about her first love and 'The Voice Within' lends a powerful pop ballad where Christina's voice soars (as always).  One of the highlights was an emotionally, touching, and haunting song called 'I'm OK' where Christina is bold enough to tell a story about her past living with an abusive father and experiencing domestic violence. This is a musical journey into Christina's life. She has shed all of her inhibitions and gloss, hype, and pretense and showing us what Christina has been trying to show us all along. I always knew she had it in her. Christina has matured immensely from her debut and Stripped is just proof that Christina has much, much more to offer us in the future.

B00003CXZ1|2.0|I have to confess that I liked a number of moments in this film, despite the fact that it is without any question overall a pretty bad film. I could compile a long list of absurdies connected with it. For instance, while I know that part of the point of the movie is to promulgate the legend of Lara Croft, sex goddess, is there really any excuse for her wearing a thin duster that she never closes over a very tight-fitting shirt while sled dogging in Siberia? The overall list of silly moments in this film could be expanded far beyond the amount of space that isalloted any reviewer.  Most of the sexual tittilation seems more appropriately targeted at adolescents than grown ups, but, then, that is true of the Tomb Raider games as well.<br />So after these negative comments, why do I still find things to enjoy? Well, for one thing, some of the fight scenes are, if not believable, at least quite inventive and fun in their over-the-top silliness. For another, Angela Jolie is never short of absolutely marvelous to behold. Had the movie merely consisted of her strolling down a sidewalk, with those beautiful lips and other unquestionably enhanced features, the movie would have been salvaged from complete disaster. If the movie fails, it isn't her fault. Although the idea of bringing any character as supranaturally athletic as Lara Croft to screen is daunting, Angelina performs far better than could possible have been anticipated. If she struts and poses a bit more than one might like, she still managed to carry off the role with some aplomb.<br />In closing, I would like to ask, when will we see an end to movies based on computer games? So far, we have had to witness a long list of terrible movies based on otherwise decent computer games. I played Tomb Raider when it first came out, and a couple of its sequels, and I have to admit they were pretty good games. But with absolutely terrible movies based on Super Mario Brothers, Wing Commander, Mortal Kombat, and others, you have to wish for filmmakers to decide not to make any further cinematic adaptations. Actually, TOMB RAIDER is actually one of the better film versions of a game, and that ought in itself to stand as a warning to Hollywood.e to wish for filmmakers to decide not to make any further cinematic adaptations.

0790749556|4.0|Astaire and Rogers were the number one box office draw for 1935, but it wasn't because of the farsightedness of RKO. After the two had managed to score unexpected popularity as a result of their second billed roles in FLYING TO RIO, they obviously needed to be paired in a follow up film. Actually, Fred was quite hesitant about this. He had been part of a dance team for most of his life, as the lesser half of Adele and Fred Astaire. He wasn't sure he wanted a new partner, and he wasn't confident that Rogers, with her background in completely different dance forms, would be the right partner under the best of circumstances. Luckily, he gave the pairing a try, and the result was the greatest dance team in cinema history.<br />Their second film together was THE GAY DIVORCEE, and it is shocking that after the success of that film, RKO could have even remotely considered having them second billed to anyone. Any film fan today can merely shake their head and ask, \\"What were they thinking?\\" Luckily, after this film they were first billed again and reunited with their best director, Mark Sandrich, to continue a string of musical films that remain unmatched.<br />So, trying to put the disappointment that Irene Dunne and not Fred and Ginger star in the film, how enjoyable is this film? It isn't unwatchable, and the scenes with Fred and Ginger are good. They have some nice dance numbers, though their performance of \\"Smoke Gets in Your Eyes\\" seems more of an afterthought. Irene Dunne was a fine comedic actress, as films such as THE AWFUL TRUTH and MY FAVORITE WIFE would later show, but despite her later appearance in the James Whale version of SHOW BOAT a year later, I don't care for her in musicals. Her voice was a tad too shrill for my taste, and her vibrato irritatingly fast. Moreover, while I like Randolph Scott in Westerns, he always seemed out of place in comedy (though he would be appropriate for MY FAVORITE WIFE). He similarly marred FOLLOW THE FLEET, playing the second romantic lead to Fred. But there is another reason that this film falls far short of what we would later come to expect from an Astaire and Rogers film: the supporting cast. TOP HAT, THE GAY DIVORCEE, and SWINGTIME are all absolutely stellar films, and each one features a rich, deep, and talented cast of supporting players such as Edward Everett Horton, Eric Blore, Erik Rhodes, Helen Broderick, and Alice Brady. ROBERTA lacks this kind of depth, and as a result lacks the charm and wit we normally associate with their best films.<br />So, this is not an unwatchable film, but it is far from one of Fred and Ginger's best. But any serious fan of their work should see it at least once.romantic lead to Fred.

0671015206|3.0|I thought the book had a lot of though put into it.  There was a lot of interesting facts, but it was all information I already knew.  I know that if you want to become wealthy you must get assets and save your money instead of spending it all on material possesions.  For some people this is very hard to do.  For me it is a very cncept for me to accept: frugality.  In my opinion, if you make enough money to buy nice things why not buy them.  Why work so hard all your life to save money and hand it all over to your heirs.  Now some people don't do that and just make a lot of money so that they may retire early and spend the rest of their life relaxing.  Maybe traveling the world.  But my whole point is, at least spend what your earn doing what you want as long as you have all of your other financial affairs in order.
B00008O31H|5.0|According to one report I read, guitarist Dan Auerbach headed down to Oxford Mississippi to spend a day playing with T-Model Ford and he has been hooked on blues ever since. Auerbach and his drummer Patrick Carney are not your usual Mississippi Hills bluesmen.  Both men are young and white and don't give you the impression that they have paid their dues so to speak.  But that aside, their brand of Delta blues crosses any racial boundary and is as raw and good as anything else coming from the Hills. &quot;Thickfrealness&quot; is the pairs sophomore release and, if you haven't heard this band, it is will serve as a fine introduction to the Keys. The CD  features a nice mix of covers and originals including the late Junior Kimbrough's &quot;Everywhere I Go&quot;.

Yes, Frank Sinatra is no longer with us and if he were I'm sure he wouldn't mind singing a duo with Michael Buble any day. These young talented cats are keeping jazz alive!
B00008S2VG|4.0|Being a casual Madonna fan &amp; an extreme lover of<BR>all kinds of music I must insist that anybody interested<BR>in pop or dance music give this CD a listen.<BR>Would the critics have been so harsh had this album been<BR>the premiere title of a new artist? I really wanted to dislike this new collection of songs but after a few listens it really grew on me.  20 years on Madonna brings us a fresh collection of tracks.

0312954468|5.0|...I for one am happy that Wilbur Smith wrote a fantastic story. I'm not going to complain that he described the colour of papyrus wrongly or something equally as trivial and stupid in the book.<BR>Now the positive - I read this book in two days. A friend suggested it, and from the first page I couldn't put it down. Smith just has this way of telling a story that involves you. They are just so colourful and expansive. Everyone I know who has read the book loved it. This book restored my faith in quality story telling. Read it.
6304698542|5.0|My feeble words can't equal the well deserved accoldes this picture has received from high places... If motion pictures are truly an art form, then this is about as good as it gets!... Cast, performances, story line, production values, and music are flawless... It was a matter of everything being at the right place at the right time... It's a history lesson, a love story, a black comedy, and a superb musical all rolled into one... Liza's multi-level characterization of the profane, talented, and worldly, yet child-like Sally Bowles is a classic that drives the rest of the story which centers on the gaudy decadent desperation of post WWI depression-riddled Berlin, played against the nightly goings on it a Cabaret... The Master of Ceremonies (Joel Grey) reflects the seething anger remaining from the war, and the insult that followed, as projected toward rising nationalism, and takeover by the Nazi party... The gathering clouds of what will come are all there to see... I loved this picture when it was first released, and have the VHS tape which I watched every few years, but until you have seen it on DVD with the digitally re-mastered picture and sound, which is nearly flawless, you really haven't seen it!... I am building a giant screen Video Projection System at the moment, and am looking foreward to seeing this larger-than-life... This is a MUST HAVE DVD for the true movie lover!
B000003CKH|5.0|This was one of the first CDs that started my music 'collection'. And i hav to say its still one of my favourites. The dry humour in their lyrics is enjoyable and every song sounds different. The good songs on this are 'daria', 'the distance', 'perhaps, perhaps', 'i will survive', and 'nugget'. I also have 'Comfort Eagle', though i think FN is better in some ways, even though 'comfort eagle' has less filler. Other songs which are good on the album are 'its coming down', 'italian leather sofa' and 'stickshifts and safetybelts'. 'race car ya yas' is strange indeed. Especially the line 'the land where large fuzzy dice, still hang proudly, like testicles from rear view mirrors'. <br />Overall a very balanced album showing many styles of music by cake; it will not lose its 'listenability' over time.
B00005JM1Y|4.0|Rowan Atkinson is very funny in this \\"Mr Bean meets James Bond\\" comedy.  Plenty of pratfalls and camera mugging together with the inevitable English toilet humor.  And I mean TOILET humor literally!  The ever-popular \\"take over the world\\" plot is given a slight twist thanks to the twisted characterisation of John Malkevich (alias Pascal Sauvage)and his droll patience with the inept Johnny English's attempts to thwart his plans make for some head-shaking chuckles. This is a film that all the family can enjoy and the kids are especially tickled by Johnny English's ability to rise above his own ineptitude.  Lots of belly laughs and good fun.<BR>(Based on the theatrical release in Australia)
B00008S2VG|4.0|As Always, we are once again immerssed into a brand new realm brought to you by none other thAn MADONNA the great.  This time around our destination is thought to be the infamous \\"AMERICAN LIFE;\\" when in reality i see it more as \\"ACOUSTIC LIFE.\\"  I can honestly say that this album (as with a few other Maddonna albums) took some getting used to.  The First listen (hosted on MTV.Com's \\"The Leak\\") it sounded like yet again a totally different genre from the last.  Altho the freestylin' attempt made on Maddy's part (as heard in the songs \\"American Life\\" and \\"Mother & Father\\") is a tad bit rediculous.  As with any other Madonna Fan since day 1 ('82), you learn to love whatever she comes up with next.<br />    Don't be fooled by the Military Motif, it's yet another one of Madonna's Promotional Images/Props to get your attention.  It's NOT a reflection of the album at all.  The album is portrayed best as an album for the Romantic (Due to 80% of the lyrics on the album which consist of love and yearning).  -Continue Reading for Track Descriptions-<br />    Once again collaborating w/producer Mirwais (who also produced most of the tracks on her album \\"Music\\"), brings more guitars to the table this time around as opposed to the occassional \\"beeps\\" & sonic \\"Whirs\\" of the computer aged synth.  This time around, it's not an album focused on hitting the dance-floor and every other club in NyC, but headed more for the Acoustic Lounge in Soho.  Yet there are songs that would sit well with Dj's and radio staions everywhere via \\"Nobody Knows Me\\", \\"Die Another Day\\", & of course \\"American Life.\\"<br />   The Title track did not sit well with me at first, but you just can't help but love her for being so silly.  And for those of you who have seen the actual UNCENSORED video for \\"American Life\\" know that it makes the song seem A whole lot coOler!  They shouldn't of opposed the video being that this is the FOURTH video that has been banned.  <br />Video Synopsis:  There's a fashion show inprogress sporting the latest fashion...none other thAn the \\"MILITIA/Aggressive\\" LoOk.  A very clever metaphor considering today's social condition.  And she's the leader of a vicious group of OPPRESSORS consisting of all girls getting ready to crash the party.  Now how about that for a STATEMENT!<br />    Being that my favorite MadonnA Album is \\"Ray Of Light,\\" this album lacks William Orbit.  This is one of the main reasons i gave this album 4 stars instead of 5.  I hope sometime in the future they will colaborate to make another album togehter.<br />    Nonetheless, \\"American Life\\" States the typical media and the downfalls of fame; while at the same time basking in the love and romance of her current marriage.  These two topics come together to create what we know as Maddy's Latest album, \\"American Life.\\"<br />Favorite Tracks include \\"Hollywood,\\" \\"Nobody Knows Me,\\" \\"Intervention.\\"<BR>Track Descriptions:<BR>1.AMERICAN LIFE-(A Side-note in the book of war) funky song w/sum aggressive lyrics and catchy beats with a lil rap scenario)<BR>2.HOLLYWOOD-(the laments of being famous)...Catchy song w/a good beat<BR>3.I'M SO STUPID-(regretful dreams)...when making a mistake, you should be playing this song, fun song to sing along to with a little bit of breakbeat acoustics.<BR>4.LOVE PROFUSION-(understanding the physics of love)...cute, mellowed out love song with a moderate tempo<BR>5.NOBODY KNOWS ME-(Surviving the Media)...A jam sure to hit turntables (Sounds like \\"Impressive Instant\\" from the 'Music' album...i could see her doing some \\"Ray of light\\" moves to this song)<BR>6.Nothing Fails-(the declaration of Love)...With the help of a guitar and church choir, this song is convincing enuf to 'pray'<BR>7.INTERVENTION-(Keeping it together)...Heartfelt song with some of the best harmonizing Madonna has done<BR>8.X-STATIC PROCESS-(self discovery)...this is officially Madonna Unplugged<BR>9.MOTHER & FATHER-(claiming independence and happiness)...an ironically fun song with madonna sounding like a little girl, and then sounding like a grown woman on the chorus; yet another clever metahpor<BR>10.DIE ANOTHER DAY-(James Bond)...a surprisingly dancable JamesBond Theme with some of the best arrangements on the album<BR>11.EASY RIDE-(striving for hapiness)...a sullen yet emotional way to end the cd, this song definitely sums up the AMERICAN DREAM.
B0000687L5|2.0|This movie has a great premise.  In 1900, the year after which the main character is named, the world was changing from a place where one's entire world was confined within a few miles' horse-ride from his home into the world of mind-numbing complexity stretching out in all directions, as alluded to in the final scene.  The sea was the romantic call to someone of the 19th century, and the ship visiting the city could have been a powerful metaphor for the cultural change.<br />Unfortunately, this movie feels like it was written and filmed by an immature teenager.  This movie has all the characteristics of a boy of about 14.  To name a few, there's silly scripted swearing that sounds like someone trying to look tough; a sappy, over-romanticized vision of beauty (she conveniently pauses at each porthole so we can see her as she walks along the deck); an absurd testosterone showdown, where the performances are intended to ... and over-the-top purple-heart sophistry on the meaning of life, and how some people are just not meant for this crazy world.  Plus a big improbable EXPLOSION thrown in! (I guess the scrap metal market must have been pretty depressed in postwar England, so they just blew those old boats up....)<br />To add to the mess, the director destroys what little mood he can work up with jarring edits, ineptly ordered flashbacks and jaw-droppingly stupid dialogue.  The worst example in the script is his rendering of the boat-as-world metaphor into garbled \\"god's piano\\" psychobabble in the final scene.  To make it even worse, he then immediately tacks on some kind of (supposedly) comic relief about having one's left arm blown-off and replaced by a right arm --- apparently to ensure the removal of any tiny amount of emotional power there might have been in this scene.  The rest of the movie is peppered with cutesy aphorisms like \\"Life is worth living as long as you have a story and someone to tell it to\\".<br />Movie magic can allow us to overlook - or even celebrate - the bizarre coincidences and strange occurrences.  The cigarette-on-the-strings bit works, more or less.  But the the director doesn't give us enough magical moments to allow us to want to believe in any of the 10 or 15 improbabilities in the script.  \\"Can I play my trumpet ONE LAST TIME?\\"  \\"Hey, I just GLUED that song BACK TOGETHER!  And they're blowing up the ship TOMORROW!\\".  I think I would have loved the scene of the piano on the rolling ship, if I wasn't so distracted wondering how they managed to keep the bench and piano together.  And am I supposed to believe that only \\"one guy\\" notices the Statue of Liberty?  It's right beside the freakin' ship!  <br />The only mildly worthy bit of this otherwise unwatchable movie is the Jelly Roll Morton scene, which has some exciting piano playing.  However, this is mitigated by the one-dimensional portrayal of Jelly Roll, and the confusingly equivocal quality Tim Roth gives to the confrontation.  It seemed like this would have been a good time to (finally!) give us some insight into the character, like his apparent dislike of competition and love of the music.  ....<br />This movie might have been great.  Instead, it's a mess.  Give it a pass.  If you still are thinking about watching this movie, get Ennio Morricone's soundtrack instead.  Assuming it has the piano duel on it.
B000002J1S|5.0|This album lies among the finest progressive works of its era.  This is Peter Gabriel unleashed.  The album is itself an experience which sort of gets through your senses in layers as you listen to this masterpiece again and again.  Tony Banks is an incredible musician on those keyboards, both acoustic (Anyway) and electronic (The Supernatural Anesthesist).  Hacket has some of his finest moments here along with his strings in &quot;Selling England&quot;, and Collins begins to stand out as a singer.  The album is simply one of the Best-10 of Progressive Rock, ever!.  Careful, if you come from listening to Peter Grabriel's &quot;So&quot;, or the late Phil Collins's work, this album may be a big disappointment to you.
B00003CXC6|5.0|If your a beginning film buff looking to expand into Japanese films or a Japanese film sage this is the DVD for you. Based on Akutagawa's short story &quot;In A Grove&quot; , Kurosawa has transferred the page deftly and seamlessly to film. Short (compared to other Kurosawa films) and easy to understand ( hint: lighting {or lack thereof} and angles) make it enjoyable for anyone wanting to explore CINEMA.

B00003CXFV|4.0|Erin Brockovich (Julia Roberts), a hard-working single mother, manages to get hired as a lawyer's assistant and ends up spearheading a multi-million-dollar civil suit against PG&E.  Though not in the same league as a great film like the similarly-themed \\"Silkwood,\\" I found this to be an entertaining and satisfying tale of the little guy triumphing against the system.  Roberts is very good as a tough, tired, disappointed woman who flaunts what she sees as her only asset--her physical beauty.  Albert Finney fleshes out the underwritten role of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry.  The character of George, however, is a misstep.  He is some kind of working woman's fantasy man--a tough, good-looking biker who is also sensitive, domestic, and good with kids.  He comes across as a blatant plot device--a convenient way to show that Brockovich's kids are being cared for while she works overtime as well as provide a love interest whose only real purpose is to be neglected so we can see the impact of her job on her personal life.  Aaron Eckhardt never really figures out what to do with the part.  Nevertheless, it's an entertaining film.
006441034X|4.0|Diana Wynne-Jones has a well-deserved reputation for funny, well-plotted, keep-you-riveted-to-your-chair fantasy stories. Here she provides an unusual sorcerer, an unlikely heroine, and a lot of sly winks at fantasies and fairy tales. Very entertaining.<br />Sophie Hatter is the eldest of three daughters, which in this fantasyland means that she's the one who doesn't have an astounding \\"fortune\\" to seek. Instead she's stuck at the hat shop. One day a plump, very rude woman comes to see the hats, and Sophie uncharacteristically insults her. Unfortunately, this woman is the Witch of the Wastes, and responds by aging Sophie into a crone. Peeved out of being shy and retiring, she tramps off to the \\"Moving Castle\\" of the supposedly evil wizard Howl, who reportedly [steals] out the souls of young girls.<br />After arriving at the castle, she encounters Howl's pleasant apprentice and contracted fire demon Calcifer (who promises to disenchant Sophie if she breaks his contract). Though she annoys the rather self-absorbed Howl and drives Calcifer almost nuts at times, Sophie becomes the cleaning lady at the Moving Castle. She begins searching for the chewed-up hearts of the girls, only to find something a lot more bizarre -- including her own peculiar magic.<br />If you've ever read a fairy tale -- Cinderella, Beauty and the Beast -- you'll know that the youngest kids are always are the favored ones. They go on to marry princes or princesses, become wealthy and beloved. Jones mocks this and many other fairy-tale cliches, such as the hilarious scene where Sophie lurches around in seven-league boots. There's even a brief homage to J.R.R. Tolkien.<br />It's certainly an interesting twist to have a not-so-evil evil-wizard, a harried apprentice, and a heroine who appears to be in her nineties. Similarly, the ideas of the \\"Moving Castle\\" with its doors to other places (including modern Wales) is very original. That's not even mentioning the attacking scarecrow.<br />Until she's aged into a crone, Sophie isn't much of a heroine; she's too timid and dull to be of interest. Post-aging, she becomes interesting and delightfully pushy. Howl is not what you think of a \\"bad\\" wizard as; his tantrums over things like hair dye are hysterically funny, and he's also immensely attractive to the opposite sex. Michael is a good sidekick, with the common-sense that Howl lacks; Calcifur the fire demon is one of Jones' most memorable characters, especially when Sophie bullies him.<br />While it isn't quite as spectacular as Jones' Chrestomanci Chronicles, \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" will appeal to those who liked fantasy spoof \\"Dark Lord of Derkholm\\" and \\"Year of the Griffin.\\" A funny, thought-provoking magical ride.d into a crone, Sophie isn't much of a heroine; she's too timid and dull to be of interest.

B00008PW3O|5.0|I think this cd is amazing, and not to buy it would be a big mistake. Why, because when you hear a song from it either on the radio or on TV, (and you eventually will) you are going to wish that you had.  The lyrics will grow on you. They are that incredibly mystifying! :)
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Ok, so Christine is gone and there is a part of Fleetwood Mac that is just not there anymore...  However, you have 4 very talented individuals left who can still produce one hell of a CD!!  Keep an open mind, this is definitely good music.  Yes, Lindsey gets creative, but I love it.  Some standouts -  Thrown Down, Miranda, Everybody Finds out and Say Goodbye.  Lindsey delivers, but especially on Say Goodbye--- listen to know what I mean, his guitar work and creative energy is always the best.  And Stevie and Lindsey harmonize so well together..  I am so glad that Fleetwood Mac came back together, even if it is without Christine.  Because they still have a lot to offer, in this age of [bad] muzak Fleetwood Mac is still #1!!  Let's just hope they come back AGAIN!
B000002UAU|5.0|To begin i'd like to say how much this album depresses me. It depresses me because nothing out there right now can even hold a candle to the brilliance of Sgt. Pepper and the Beatles as a band for that matter. I cannot say how revolutionary this album is because i was not there to witness what it did for music in general (after all i'm only 17). After a few listens you become to realize how wonderous this album is. From Harrison's seering guitar on the title track to the booming end of \\"A Day in the Life\\" (my favorite beatles song EVER!! along with \\"In My Life\\"), we see exactly how the beatles munipulated sound so that we could experience it with our mind's eye. I can honestly say there is NO \\"filler\\" on Sgt. Pepper and all the songs will spark some sort of emotion. The creativeness of John Lennon and the pop sensibility of Paul McCartney is what makes this album so great. Do not judge this album until you have listened to it from beginning to end. After you have indulged in the chopped up chatter played backwards in the end of \\"A Day in the Life\\" you will know that this album is one of the Beatles best albums and in my opinion thier most creative album.
B000089A07|5.0|Red Dragon is a fresh remake of \\"Manhunter\\". It's the prequel to Silence Of The Lambs, the first film in the Hannibal Lecter Trilogy, whose story concludes with \\"Hannibal\\". Based on the novel by Thomas Harris, the suspenseful crime thriller marks the first time Hannibal Lecter appears as a powerful and villainous character. On DVD, it is an experience worth watching, especially for its innovative use of special features.<br />Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, whose very presence, menacing albeit elegant, has become an American cinema icon. Hopkins hosts the DVD, which is quite a treat for his fans, and takes us on a tour of \\"the dungeon\\", chalk-full of his criminal profiles and behind-the-scenes looks on the making of the film. Danny Elfman provided the music and we are also treated to some of his more chilling orchestral pieces. <br />The erratic loner that is Ralph Feines character is similar to Norman Bates in Hitchcock's Psycho, unstable, threatening and unbelievably cruel. He lived in a large home by the swamps of the rural South, and there are hints that he was abused. Eventually, he loses grip on reality and transforms himself into \\"The Red Dragon\\", otherwise known as Satan the Devil as seen in the Book of Revelation. In psychotic delusion after seeing a William Blake painting, he is convinced he must do the Devil's work by bringing death and disaster in Apocalyptic proportions. <br />The F.B. I. agent played by Ed Norton tracks down the killer, and his mission becomes more urgent when the Red Dragon killer is bent on murdering his wife and child. The film is the most gruesome of the Hannibal Lecter films in my personal opinion. It has more R-rated visuals, blood, etc than any of the other films. Not even the dinner scene in Hannibal in which Lecter makes his victim eat his own brain is as shocking in material as some of the horrific atrocities the Red Dragon commits during his killing sprees. Evidently, this film is for a very mature audience, and to be taken as a film that exposes the terrible, inhuman and psychotic psychological make-up of crazed killers. The F.B.I. and  police authorities can benefit immensely from watching this film.  Other than the gore, the drama is full of suspense, and of course, Anthonly Hopkins as the incarcerated Dr. Lecter is a must see as always. He is witty, dark and humorous and makes his introduction in a film that begins the series.
B00008NRLX|5.0|I do miss the female vocals and some of the larger-sounding orchestrations that added so much to the beautifully layered sound on their CD *Smile* (by the way, I can't imagine how *anyone* could classify that album as &quot;weak&quot;! That album ranks in the top 3 of my most treasured and listened-to CDs), but this CD provides its own rich textures and sound that are almost completely different from that found on the aforementioned. This is truly &quot;rainy day music&quot; of the sort that you'd want to listen to casually, on a rainy day while cleaning the house or on a beautiful, sunny day in the backyard, on the beach, etc. The lyrics are vintage Jayhawks--clever and evocative and humorous at the same time--and the melodies are extremely &quot;catchy.&quot; I found myself singing these tunes (or at least humming them) within 2 listens; usually it takes me a lot longer to retain and/or warm up to a tune.
B00006GO99|5.0|It's clear that Monk's music is appear to be written for saxophone players: Sonny Rollins, Johnny Griffin, John Coltrane and, of course, Charlie Rouse were among his partners. But his last quartet with Rouse is very close like a Jazz Quartet should be. Rouse understanding of Monk's music is very important to play it with freedom and every tune is this title has it. Special mention to Bye Ya. The joy of listen Monk and Rouse together is here.

B000066C6Z|5.0|I saw this film for the first time when I was in high school and it immediatly became my favorite film by Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Bros.  I recently caught it again last night on TNT and it's still as funny as I remember.<br />If you're a fan of Airplane or the Naked Gun Movies then you owe it to yourself to see this movie! I don't believe it is as well known as the previous mentioned titles but I feel it is far funnier.  Plus, the songs are pretty darn good for parody tunes. Val Kilmer gives us a glimpse of the vocal talents he showcased in the doors and this only proves that besides being a decent actor he is also a very versitile vocalist.<br />So hurry up and see this flick. Some of the gags are a little dated but they still hold up.
B0000028RR|5.0|This CD is frankly, outstanding.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is (a) a strict selfish conservative or (b) does not know what good music is. People say that RATM is to \\"anti-everything,\\" but the truth is that they are just anarchists.  Anarchists believe that the government impedes human beings ability to be free, and therefore do not believe in it.  While RATM tends to target ideas they are against, they have a very deep philosophy.  Anybody who thinks this album's lyrics are \\"cheesy,\\" or not worth paying attention to should check out the reading list on the bands website...

B00008S2VG|3.0|Madonna's spiritual awakening is evidently here to stay. \\"American Life\\" the third disc in her spiritual trilogy picks right up where \\"Music\\" left off. \\"American Life\\" is a good record. Trouble is it seems the spiritual life has [drawn]the fun and sense of humor right out of  Miss Madge. Basically everything Madonna had to say about her spiritual epiphany was summed up in the billiant track \\"Drowned World, No Substitue for Love\\" on the groundbreaking \\"Ray of Light\\". Things got a little more introspective on \\"Music\\" but introspection was balanced with the barnstorming of the massive hit \\"Music\\" which was followed up by one of her best singles and videos to date \\"Don't Tell Me.\\"  So we arrive at disc three \\"American Life\\" and themes become redundant. Madonna suffers from the loss of her mother.....duh? Money, fame, fashion don't bring lasting happiness....duh? What we loved about Madonna was she was a scappy broad from the hood who made it big, made money and men look fabulous while maintaining total control. No drugs, no bankrupcy.....just good, honest playful fun....the joke always being on her detractors. Hopefully she'll go full circle and realize she can have her spiritual cake and eat it too. Time to get back INTO THE GROOVE.
B00006IX0R|4.0|While I wish this U.S. release was a 2-disc set (they deserve it!) this disc includes the most important and famous works of the Irish quartet.  And as a bonus you get the two previously unreleased tracks including the immediately catchy 'Stars.'<br />  HOWEVER, like other &quot;Best Of&quot; CDs of artists, this disc contains edited versions of the original songs (The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars.)  Most notable cuts occur in the songs 'Ridiculous Thoughts' where the haunting opening bars by Dolores are completely cut out and the 'Hollywood' track had the opening shortened as well.  If you're a stickler for the original versions of the songs, then this &quot;Best Of&quot; may not be agreeable with you.  But, if you're new to the Cranberries (where have you been!?!) you'll find this an amazing listen that is sure to be a permanent addition to your CD rotation.
B0000542DJ|5.0|This Oliver Stone epic blows me away every single time that I sit down to watch it. The direction is brilliant, the acting is stellar and the script is so well researched (I know, I own the documented script), so sharp, so thoughtful and so intriguing. Every aspect of the movie comes together perfectly, keeping you hooked throughout the entire film. <br />The movie takes on the hefty approach of an inner-governmental conspiracy brought to light by the unpopular new Orleans DA Jim garrison. Many people thought he was a flake, a radical, and completely insane for pursuing what seemed to be an unanswerable mystery surrounding the assassination of Presidnet Kennedy. In the film, Stone has used documents, historical facts and leads from Garrison and co.'s investigation. According to the film, Oswald was most likely exactly what he had claimed...a patsy.<br />I won't, under good conscience, ruin any more of the plot for any potential first-time viewers, but I will say this: this is a landmark film for american cinema. Oliver Stone has given us a film that is daring, shocking and completely convincing. Lone gunman my rear-end!...
B00005JKTF|3.0|I watched this movie because it had Cate Blanchett and the French Resistance, two things I like. You would think a film with this subject matter would evoke solemn feelings and a great tension considering the danger at hand, but unfortunately, like Charlotte herself I imagine, I forgot all of that and my brain turned to mush whenever Julien (Billy Crudup) came on screen.  <br />This movie had lots of cliches and things that didn't make sense. As other reviewers have said, her mission in France was never clear. Oh well. The story did play up the good old save the Jews, reek occaissionally of Pearl Harbor (*puke*) had the [worst] ending, and did no justice to the absolute courage of the Resistance or bother to explain what motivated some French people to collaborate. <br />But I don't think the film was out to explain the merits of the Resistance, the sentiments of the occupied French people, the workings of the British operations or anything better left to seperate films. The film, like \\"Dominique\\", had no view on these things, just accepted they were there. And they were. <br />The most interesting thing in the film is Charlotte's relationship with Julien. It's for the most part unspoken, just an underlying tension, but its well done and makes a fabulous show right in front of the Germans! haha It's also a great contrast to her relationship with the English pilot, which is quick and passionate and points out so clearly how little she knew this man, and herself. It's a selfish relationship with the two of them absorbed in their passion for each other. Her relationship with Julien is unselfish, they become close helping others - the Jewish children, his father, the Resistance. <br />I'm going to defend this movie despite its flaws because I like this message, and am usually annoyed by the films where romance overshadows the historical tragedies like Titanic and Pearl Harbor. I'm sure this film knows there are better films out there to deal with the historical aspects,but for me it functioned as decent human interaction (until the stupid ending, that is) and beautiful scenery. And, dare I be so shallow, Julien was hot right there, on the floor, in front of the Nazis.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I will begin this review by saying this album will scare off many hardcore fans of Opeth who have followed the band since they first began.  in addition, it will also attract many new fans.  On previous albums the formula had been combining brutal Death Metal vocals with clean passages to make a ten minute mastperpiece of a song.  However, this album to me sounds like a cross between Pink Floyd and Bauhaus with the traditional Opeth sound thrown in there of course.  There are no Death vocals whatsoever.  there is very little electric guitar on this album also.  So this album really showcases Mikael Akerfeldt's incredible voice and songwriting ability.  In addition to the change, there is still the Incredible guitar solo's of Petr Lindgren, and the Bass playing on this album is incredible.  The songs are a lot shorter then on any other albums (average of about 5 minutes).  while the songs are shorter they are still progressive and epic.  Standout tracks include Windowpane, In My time of Need, and Closure.  the only reason I gave this album four stars was because at times the album seemed a bit repetitive.  The songs mostly follow a Verse-chorus pattern.  this isn't to much of a problem because the guitaring is still as incredible as on previous albums.  This is an album that will most likely reach out to the American market and gain many new fans.  I would like to see Opeth return to their old style of music on their next album.  This album is just a nice change of pace.
B000067DNC|5.0|This series takes off after the movie, Stargate.  Great special effects and stories.  If you are a scifi fan, this series is a MUST.  Richard Dean Anderson takes the role of the Kurt Russell character, and plays it in a superb manner.  Just the right &quot;bad attitude&quot;.  The James Spader character is also here (I forget the actors name, sorry).  Added are Samantha Carter (A beautiful Amanda Tapping), sort of a &quot;science officer&quot;, and a character who is one of the &quot;soldiers&quot; of the enemy, with the wolfs head armor type, who is now allied with the humans of Earth.  This makes a team of four....&quot;SG-1&quot;.  There are other SG team.  They explore the universe and battle to defend Earth and other planets.  I have been in scifi since 1960.  This series is superb!  It is on the SCIFI channel now with new episodes.<BR>Highly recommended.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Geez, I couldn't believe some of the reviews I read here... &quot;This album is a bit too sincere and personal&quot;-- So I guess people still love cheesy, commercial &quot;I love you&quot; songs.<br />Yes, American Life may not be as commercial as some of Madonna's previous works (Music, Ray Of Light), but by no way is it bad/dull/whatsoever - in fact, it's a superb album in its own right.<br />Madonna truly opens up for the very first time in years, and delivers some of the finest pop music ever. Give her a chance, it's friggin' worth it.<br />Some stand-out tracks: American Life, Hollywood, Love Profusion, Nothing Fails (an instant classic), Mother &amp; Father.
B00008DDRX|5.0|Probably the best movie in automobile racing, the 25-Hour of Le Mans delivers incredible scenes for the lovers of this sport. Storyline its not bad, although the real excitment comes from the track itself. If you like any kind of racing, and enjoy wathcing on-board cameras @ 200mph, you should definately own this dvd.
B00000JNO1|3.0|Due to incredible pressure from their record label, Lynyrd Skynyrd was in a big time rush to record and release this record. The title seems to come from the attitude the band members took in writing and recording this music. Truthfully quality wise the music also rates the same as the attitude.<br />Don't get me wrong, these songs are certainly very listenable. And Saturday Night Special, Whiskey Rock N Roller, and On The Hunt have many catchy elements about them. However, when compared to their previous songs, the effort is a little substandard. That little extra hook that was present in such gems as Sweet Home Alabama, The Ballad Of Curtis Lowe, Gimmee Three Steps, and Freebird is missing in this batch of Skynyrd tunes. I will admit the guitar soloing is pretty first rate, the drumming much improved, and Ronnie Van Zandt's vocals are just as expressive as on prior recordings.<br />Nonetheless, this CD rates as a good one rather than a great one.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Madonna had evolved in an unpredictable way in front of our eyes.  From being a sex icon to being an example for society.  Example for society?  Yes, and Americal Life is showing us how she feels about today's society.  She points out its flaws and its strenghts, and what is left at the end.  Americal Life is an external, as well as an internal journey through Madonna's world: her inner-self and her external environment.  The music here and the lyrics have a more deep, melodic, and rhythmic beat only Madonna could have created.  Favorite songs are \\"Nobody Knows Me\\" and \\"Mother and Father.\\"  Also standing out are \\"X-tatic Process,\\" \\"Hollywood,\\" \\"Americal Life,\\" \\"Die Another Die,\\" \\"Easy Ride,\\" \\"Love Profusion,\\" and \\"Intervention.\\"
B00008YLV2|5.0|This movie is a well made movie. Cinematagraphics, charicters, all of it is well done. But there are many well made movies out there, and that is not enough to make me give a movie a really high rating.<br />What stands out in this movie is reality. Ive seen many movies, I've seen lots of cinema Gore. Saving Private Ryan, for all the impact it had, had nothing on this. As a man who has been involved in real operations, with real blood, This movie is the most real I have ever seen. I have never felt that almost ill feeling in my stomach from any movie before. I never understood when others had problems with graphic movies. Now I have some conception. This movie is not made to spare the weak of stomach.<br />That said, I found it to be one of the most valuble movies I've watched, ever. Bing based and very well grounded in a real story, gives it even more impact. The balance of telling the truth, without being sadisticly war glorying or masochisticly war hating is amazing. I have never seen its equal. Watch this movie. but dont show it to your kids, at least not untill they decide they want to join the army.
B00008S2VG|5.0|WOW! What a pleasure! I adore this woman, girl, boy, mess!!!!<BR>And what ever anyone things cause of her last video SHE is a star and a REBELL too! I loved the first video it showed us the picture of America we all just don't wanna see...But her first single of this album will NOT be the last one!! There are songs like \\"Hollywood\\" which may flash some of us like a realistic look in a mirror...but I also want to recommend songs like \\"mother and father\\" which gave us a better view in the soul of madonna...many faces...many good songs...NOT ONLY for real MADONNA fans it's a new area!!! This girl is the BEST!!!
B00005QG9J|4.0|This is by far Incubus' best album. Each song shows alot of growth and maturity. People are calling them a &quot;sellout&quot; band because they changed their sound. Just to let those people know something anytime you sign on the dotted line you've sold out. Anyway back to the review I think they grew up from the Fungus and SCIENCE days. Which is a very good thing. I liked the older stuff but this new stuff has so much promise. Plus they're alot more focused on their writing. They're trying new things and making great songs. Anyway I think you should give this album a try.
B000002IWH|5.0|The Crow soundtrack not only reflects the dark mood of the film, it actually did much to create that dark mood in the first place.  One is hard pressed to say which came first, the movie or the music; that is how closely linked both aspects of the production are.  Jane Siberry's It Can't Rain All the Time will forever be identified with The Crow in my mind; this hauntingly beautiful track makes this album worth buying all by itself; I know of no other song I could even compare it to in terms of its depth of feeling and quiet intensity.  The other 13 tracks are pretty amazing songs in their own right, serving up a sampler of styles from rock's slightly darker and heavier side.  Stone Temple Pilot's Big Empty is immediately recognizable to anyone who ever listened to a radio in the early 1990s, but I most enjoyed hearing some offerings from bands I am less familiar with.  My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult is a band I have never heard of outside of The Crow soundtrack, and I'm really surprised this group has not received more attention over the years.  For Love Not Lisa is another group that impressed me, especially with the \\"I would die for you\\" refrain that forms the heart of their song Slip Slide Melting.  I know Pantera only be reputation, and I'm glad I got to hear a sampling of their work here.  Nine Inch Nails and Rage Against the Machine are two bands that have never captured my attention, but their contributions to this soundtrack have me thinking I ought to take another look at them.  Rollins Band's Ghostrider came as a bit of a shock to me because the lead singer sounds remarkably like Jim Morrison, and this song really has the sound of a modernized Doors song.  The Cure and Violent Femmes are two of my favorite groups, so I could ask nothing more of a soundtrack than to include an incredible new song from each of them.  There really and truly is not a bad song to be found among these fourteen tracks.  Those who abstain from the heavier side of rock and roll may not enjoy this album as much as I do, but this is an impressive assembly of substantive tracks from a diverse spectrum of quality artists, and every single track serves a real purpose in the movie itself.may not enjoy this album as much as I do, but this is an impressive assembly of substantive tracks from a diverse spectrum of quality artists, and every single track serves a real purpose in the movie itself.

WHAT A SCENE!  hawk was facing elimination and pulls through to beat bull, while jason cutler looks on and finally realizes that hawk is a super dad. i still resent john to this day for always being bull and making me be hawk every time.  he would always trick me and tell me &quot;but bri, you get to be hawk. you win the truck!&quot; if i had to do it all again, i would still be lincoln hawk. i would recomend this movie to anyone who is an arm-wrestler or a friend of an arm wrestler.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|After listening to \\"Say You Will\\" repeatedly for the past two weeks, I've reached the conclusion that this is the darkest, bleakest record ever released by any Fleetwood Mac lineup, despite the occasional semblance of cheeriness in the presentation. This is a good thing-- it takes guts for a band that was once one of the most commercially successful in the world to return with something this strange. True, it's not as bizarre as \\"Tusk\\", but with Christine McVie's poppier influence out of the picture, there's far more space for Lindsey Buckingham's paranoid, obsessive qualities to surface, both in the lyrics and the production.<br />Not that \\"Say You Will\\" isn't a true band effort (though a few of its tracks were originally intended for a Buckingham solo record); the contributions of the Fleetwood/John McVie rhythm section instantly elevate this recording above any of the principals' solo efforts, and they push Buckingham to far greater heights as a guitarist than he reaches when he's multitracking all the instruments. The molten, assaultive solo that closes \\"Murrow Turning Over In His Grave\\" and the similarly brutal, near-metal sound of \\"Come\\"'s chorus are two obvious cases in point, but throughout the album Buckingham's playing is freer and more stylistically diverse than it's ever been. His songwriting isn't quite as consistent, though-- \\"Murrow\\" is pretty much a boilerplate anti-media rant, \\"Come\\" is the nastiest and most unpleasant song he's ever written, and while \\"Peacekeeper\\" isn't bad, its glossier production makes it feel like it belongs on an altogether different album. But his other songs are winners-- \\"What's The World Coming To?\\" effectively meshes the classic 70's Mac sound with social commentary, while \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" is the closest he's come to pure pop since \\"Mirage\\".<br />But the best songs on the record are largely Stevie Nicks's; while \\"Illume\\" doesn't make a whole lot of sense (how, exactly, does this song relate to Sept. 11?), \\"Thrown Down\\" and the title track are out-and-out classics, among the best songs she's ever written, enhanced greatly by Buckingham's guitar (just as his songs are improved by her voice-- clearly, these two will always sound better together than apart). \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Goodbye Baby\\" aren't far behind. And even on the lesser tracks, she sounds better than she has in years.<br />Yes, it's a bit long; but then again, so was \\"Tusk\\", and that underrated album still stands as the Mac's finest work. \\"Say You Will\\" doesn't quite reach that level, but it's far better than the somewhat lukewarm reviews it's received suggest. I'd certainly rather hear Buckingham and Nicks working together at this high a level than hear new solo albums from either.Down\\" and the title track are out-and-out classics, among the best songs she's ever written, enhanced greatly by Buckingham's guitar (just as his songs are improved by her voice-- clearly, these two will always sound better together than apart). \\"Silver Girl\\" and \\"Goodbye Baby\\" aren't far behind.

0446608955|5.0|This is a beautiful story based on the Authors sister and the undying love she gave to life.  It is the story of Landon and Jamie two people that come from very differnt worlds.  Landon- popular, reckless, no direction in life and generally only looks out for himself.  Jamie- sweet, shy, caring daughter of an over-protective, old fashioned, widowed minister. In this setting they find love and loss as Jamie teaches Landon to have a greater appreciation, and enjoyment of life and all it has to offer. You need to read the book before watching the movie. The movie is good but it doesn't do the book justice. (the book it that good!!!) Please read all of his books you won't ever be disapointed !...
B00008S2VG|3.0|Okay, she did it again. Madonna changed her style. This time she is the hard Nikita-Type. I like her changes and her perfection in it. <BR>So - what is good about the record ? It seems like Madonna says something with it, it is definitely trying to have \\"lyrics\\". They are not too good, but at least it is nice to hear a little bit more than \\"MUSIC makes the people come together\\".<BR>But why only three stars? Since True Blue, Madonna has impressed not only by improving her voice from one album to the next, but also by sticking to an outstanding quality with the production. This new album - well - it cannot keep up with that at all (Music had its problems already). It is produced just too simple, it sounds like plastic, cold and sterile. This is of course intentionally, but that does not make it better. Even in the love songs which should get to your heart - in these songs at least Madonnas voice is soft - the music makes you feel like in the fridge. Sometimes it seems, even \\"Like A Virgin\\" was carefully arranged compared to that one. In fact, the contrast between \\"Ray of Light\\" and \\"American Life\\" could not have been greater. While William Orbit tried to create a lot of warm atmosphere around very simple songs, this one strips the songs completely naked and sometimes it seems Mirvais has run completely out of ideas. As I think Ray of Light has been one of the best Pop-Albums ever and \\"Music\\" still impressed with beats or strange arrangements (Don't tell me), I just cannot find my way into this one. <BR>Madonna definitely has changed again and created a new consistent album, but not for the better.<BR>However, people who like the singles \\"Die Another Day\\" and \\"American Life\\" might enjoy the album.
0788812408|5.0|This seems to be the highlight of Disney animation. The Little Mermaid never seems to get boring, while the others get dry (no pun intended). This animated movie spawned pretty much every type of merchendice: video games, dolls, books, panties, happy meals, ice cream, socks, etc., etc., etc.<br />So why is this movie so good? It's not because of the subliminal message on the original cover. This is the kind of movie that puts everything together without burning the cake. The songs aren't bad either. Even if you hate Hakunamatata (or however you spell that stupid song) from The Lion King, Sebastian's Under The Sea actually has a nice rythm. Back on the subject, Ariel is the rebelious daughter of Tritan, the self-proclaimed king of the sea. Tritan becomes especially distraut when Ariel falls for a human fisherman, so Ariel seeks help from the Sea Witch, Ursula.
B00006JKLI|3.0|It's possible no one will ever see this, as Amazon's warped indexing system makes it almost impossible to FIND this DVD-A (it doesn't come up on ANY search for Yes OR Fragile, nor is it listed in Amazon's DVD-A section), but here goes...<br />I've read most of the reviews of this DVD-A piece; nowhere did I see mention of a very important fact: This is NOT the 5.1 mix of the classic Fragile album.  There are a number of points on this version that have unforgiveable editing changes from the audio CD.  Yes, it's true the mix allows you to hear things you were never able to make out before, but I believe SOME of those things were never IN the original released mix.  There are changes here that remind me of Frank Zappa's own CD release of We're Only In It for the Money, where he changed not just the mix, but the CONTENT of the pieces.  It was horrendous, and I couldn't wait until the original mix was eventually released.  I'm astounded that no other review I read mentioned the cuts in \\"We Have Heaven\\", \\"South Side of the Sky\\" and \\"The Fish\\", to name the most glaring of them.  The changes are small--only a measure or so removed or changed--but they ruin the music, to my ear.  I also object to the small changes in the arrangements (the very ends of \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"We Have Heaven\\", for example).<br />And where the hell is the bass?  Squire's bass playing and Bruford's drumming were the elements that REALLY separated Yes from other prog-rock groups of the time; a new mix should CERTAINLY have brought the bottom of Squire's sound out more to match the high end that was a trademark of his style.  I should say that I DID like the mix on \\"The Fish\\", lack of bottom and that inexcusable 6/4 measure (in a 7/4 piece) near the end notwithstanding.<br />To my particular ear, Fragile (my first DVD-A) is the least impressive of the DVD-A pieces I've bought, but perhaps that's because I'm a bit fanatical about Yes.  Surprisingly, ELP's Brain Salad Surgery came off much better--and I'mentirely predisposed towards Yes and not an ELP fan at all.  It's not terrible, but it could have been much better.<br />Now, what I want is a COMPLETELY FAITHFUL DVD-A of Tales from Topographic Oceans. (Don't hold your breath...)
B000002BVN|5.0|This was fly and I think it was great how they were mixed and everything he's done on this c.d. really shows that he put a lot of hard work into this c.d. and if you haven't already bought this I think that you should run to the store right now and get it, because it is WONDERFUL and I GIVE IT 5 STARS!!!!!
0316666343|4.0|This novel is fantasticly heartbreaking.  I would recomend it to anyone who is a dareing reader, and is willing to cry through the pages of the book as Susies family and friends struggle to get by after her murder.  I loved this book!
B000002C1W|4.0|First, let's get this debate about it not really being Pink Floyd w/o Wafers over.  The first front man in the band was Syd Barrett and who was Barrett's friend and taught him to blay the guitar before he joined Floyd....well that would be David Gilmour.  When Barrett was getting a little too trippy to bring off the performances Gilmour came in to help out, Barrett's behavior got to the point where he was no longer a muscial member of Floyd, and the rest is history.  So, this is a Floyd album.  Is it the best? No. But, I'd put it in the top 5 with The Wall, Dark Side of The Moon, Wish You Were Here, and Animals.  For those others who thinks it just re-hash Floyd then listen to the previous 4 oldies I mentioned and this one and there is nooo wayyy you can say that.  Hell, its music and not politics or religion so ... enjoy the album.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|This movie is a very , very good movie. It works backward (you find out why on the end) what is so great about this movie is that when you think you got everything figured out (or at least something) it backfires at you and changes your idea. When you are watching this movie and get little bored don't turn it off (you would be glad on the end you didn't)
B00000F1D3|5.0|Everybody knows that Cher is one of the best singers ever. After many cd's and years of work she still releases hits.<BR>After her 1995 album &quot;A man's world&quot; that was a very soft album. Cher appeared again in the market in 1998 with this album. Her best album (I like this album very much, but it's not my favorite. My favorites are &quot;Cher&quot; (1987), &quot;Heart of stone&quot; (1990) and &quot;Love hurts&quot; (1991)). I mean her best in the commercial way.<BR>It was certified Platinum x4 in the US and sold 7 million copies worldwide.<BR>The first single &quot;Believe&quot; was an international #1 hit. Followed by other hits such as &quot;Strong enough&quot;, &quot;All or nothing&quot;, &quot;Dov'e l'amore&quot; and &quot;The power&quot;.<BR>Cher added to this work her 1987 hit &quot;We all sleep alone&quot; but this time had more dance influences.<BR>The direction that Cher took this time was dance music and she really did it great.<BR>Cher also won her first Grammy ever with this cd. So you have to &quot;Believe&quot; that this cd is fantastic.
B00004TH6O|5.0|Rated R is a flawless record in my opinion. It is on a rare occasion that I buy a cD that I can listen to the whole way through, multiple times and love every individual song. Feel Good Hit opens the album in all it's glory and has a really cool distorted solo. After listening to Feel Good Hit of the Summer, you can't help but finding yourself moments or hours later humming or tapping the song while driving, relaxing, or while doing work. Lost Art is good and has a wide variety of interesting sounds. Josh Homme's vocals are at his best here. Leg of Lamb is the most unique song I ever heard and you can see kind of how it later influences No One Knows on the next album. The solo in Leg of Lamb is simple, yet really awesome in it's high pitched tone. Auto-Pilot is definitley one of the top 3 songs on the album. Nick Oliveri displays excellent vocals with his bass work and Mark Lanegan shows off the best backing vocals I've ever heard towards the end. Better Living Through Chemistry is an odd song that I really cannot describe. It is really interesting near the end as the band fades in and out the main guitar riff, then Homme and Lanegan going \\"ahh...\\" You really have to hear this one to get it. Monsters in the Parasol is humorous and has a catchy little riff. Quick and To The Pointless is my second favorite. It's super catchy and easy to play on guitar. I got the tabs and am probably going to cover it at the next show I play. It's just really a rockin' song. When I saw the Queens live I flipped when they performed this song. In the Fade is the best. I love Mark Lanegan's voice. The chorus (\\"Live 'til you die...\\") is so great. It's a little slow, but fast enough to keep things interesting. Tension Head is the most heavy song on the album. I love it's super fast chorus and Nick Oliveri's gritty vocals. Lightning Song is a nice, cool relieving acoustic after that damn fast Tension Head song and I think I lOst My Headache is my least favorite but still is amazing, and I would prefer listening to it than many other artist's songs. The horn solo and monotone sounds at the end are kind of cool and funny, but many people may find these sounds annoying. I hope all who read this are helped out. I strongly recommend buying this more than any other album by the queens. If you're debating between this and Smashing Pumpkins, sorry, but I'd say go for the Pumpkins. Even though Rated R is flawless, I wish Ode To Clarissa and Never Say Never had made it on to the final album. I don't believe they were cut and made into b-sides. Oh well....
B000084T18|1.0|Yawwwwwwwwwwwwwn. What's the difference between this guy, Ja Rule and Puffy? Well, this guy has been shot more times, that's about it. In terms of what you get when you press play, they are xerox copies of each other. Hey, let's go ahead and do a couple of tribute albums to this guy!! He deserves it just as much as eminem, which received his first tribute cd when he had been releasing cd's for about as long as this guy has, which is about 1 year. Once again, I did try to endure going through this stuff. I just couldn't. Did anybody notice this guy barely moves his jaw and lips when he raps? That's why he gets such a boring, monotonous, mumbling kind of undecipherable vibe. Reminds me of super musical genius Ja Rule. Remember mr.J had to lyp-sync on the Mtv VMA's as he is unable to reproduce rapping live, which is not anymore difficult than normal conversational speech!! Amazing. If these are the idols of today's youth, we are doomed. People who think this is music have no idea whatsoever about what music is. None at all. Zero. Nada. Actually, less than zero. But, ignorance is bliss.  Hitting the \\"no\\" icon beneath this review because you are 50 fan and you THINK I am wrong is a stamp of approval - admitting that everything I have said are absolute truths. Go ahead, show us your ignorance. Those who vote in favor are rare glimmers of hope left in this world of musical ignorance. The facts speak for themselves, but only to those who have at least a basic level of musical knowledge. Now, excuse me. I have to get back to my Death Metal, Jazz, Blues, Funk, and Afro-Cuban CD's...REAL MUSIC.
076780421X|5.0|Matthew Perry is adorable in this movie!  I loved the facial expressions and other physical comedy he put into it.  Salma Hyek does an excellent job in putting forth the emotion the story generates.  The movie is a delightful romantic comedy about a young, successful business man (Perry) who goes to Las Vegas to oversee the building of a nightclub.  He meets a beautiful woman (Hayek) and shares a one night stand with her.  She disappears for three months, only reappearing to tell him that she is pregnant.  The movie follows them as they overcome the [gap] between their cultures and way of life.  It has comedy, romance, and serious moments in all the right places.  I enjoyed it thoroughly and recommend it to everyone!
B00006LLNU|5.0|It does not make any sense to compare ( ) to anything else because it really is not like anything else.  Having been a fan since I first heard Vidrar Vel Til Loftarasa, Sigur Ros' albums exemplify what music should be: sweeping, but at the same time, subtle...powerful, painting emotion without telling you exactly how to feel.  It was an instantaneous love affair that began for me with Agaetis Byrjun, and it's not let up.  The Hopelandic that Jonsi sings in pushes my mind to wander in terms that would be confined by english; hearing his voice tip toe across the repetition engraves images of innocence in my psyche, while conjuring notions of subdued joy.<br />It's easy to see why so many people aren't able to \\"get into\\" Sigur Ros.  Unlike fellow Icelandics Mum and Bjork (all amazing visionaries and musicians)whose strength lies in the ability to construct a palatable pop song, Sigur Ros is more concerned with atmospherics and mood.  It's difficult to compare a song like Mum's \\"Ballad of the Broken Birdie Records\\" to anything on ( ) because they differ so much in terms of execution.  That seems to be Sigur Ros' \\"problem.\\"  They don't know how to \\"get to the point.\\"  However, this seems to be one of the draws.  The songs on ( ) burn so slowly that sometimes, it feels as if they stall, only to resume in magical time, perfect time, lending each note to a building intensity.  <br />Standout tracks on ( ) include Vaka (Track 1), Samsyketi (Track 3), Njosnavelin (Track 4), The Death Song (Track 7) and the Pop Song (Track 8).  <br />This world is one where conventionality is the norm and oftentimes the ideal.  Sigur Ros' sound is unconventional, but it is magical, it is epic.  Some people cannot understand Sigur Ros, but that never stops Sigur Ros from constructing beautiful music for people that do understand.
0804102988|5.0|An epic spans generations, but Rutherford spans the ages!  From cave man to Twentieth Century in an engaging walk through time, Sarum is so well researched and so full of fine detail,  you feel as if you are there.  This is one of those books that you think of long after the final page is read.  You miss the characters. You see the settings in your mind.  Educational and so enjoyable, Sarum made me an Edward Rutherford fan.
B00000DCHI|5.0|Everyone has heard the vast majority of the songs on this two-disc compilation containing many of Billy Joel's most popular tunes.  With undisputed classics like Piano Man, Captain Jack, Say Goodbye to Hollywood, It's Still Rock and Roll to Me, The Longest Time, Tell Her About It, Only The Good Die Young, She's Always A Woman, etc., etc., etc., etc., there's no way you could go wrong buying this CD.  This album is a surefire winner for anyone who's ever enjoyed the music of Billy Joel.  <br />With so many well-known and well-liked songs on this album, it may seem frivolous to write this review.  However, I am compelled to tell you about a song you may not know - a song that appeared for the first time on this album.  <br />Amid all the enormously popular material found in this greatest hits compilation, there's one track that is like a secret treasure.  It happens to be the very last song of the collection, perched quietly at the end of disc two, waiting to be discovered.  After hearing twenty-three of Billy Joel's most famous tunes, the typical listener is probably feeling pretty satisfied with their purchase of this album.  <br />Then comes track twenty-four.  \\"The Night Is Still Young\\" is among the most resplendent, emotive, and soaring songs I have ever heard.  The sublety of craft and feel conveyed in this song compares to Billy Joel's best work.  As the tune swells up into the chorus, all you can do is close your eyes and savor the experience of this incredible song.  Although this song was never a megahit like the rest of the tracks in this collection, \\"The Night Is Still Young\\" is one of my favorite songs ever.  The last track alone is worth the price of this album.  <br />Of course, most people will buy this album for the other 23 songs, and I certainly don't blame them.  Just make sure you don't overlook the splendor of that final track, one that rewards you as a delectable dessert follows a full-course dinner at a fancy restaurant.  All 24 of these songsin their entirety, including the lesser known last track, represent Billy Joel's finest work.
B00008PW3O|3.0|The booklet - a pain in the [...].<BR>The recording quality - over produced, over manipulated and harsh sounding highs.<BR>The extra suff- enhanced - not worth the extra hassle and bucks<BR>The music - some of it is good - Smile at You and Peacekeeper for example.  Lindsay seems to tinker, add and manipulate because he can.  More is not always better.  Technology is not always your friend. Things should be kept simpler.  Fleetwood Mac has always been at it's best when it keeps simple - from the Peter Green days and forward.  Would I buy it again - yes - but only half of it.
B00000ILDF|2.0|Written as an exponent, the 3 in Alien 3 should have been a denominator. It's an unworthy sequel to the stunning first two \\"Aliens\\" films. It was endlessly rewritten, and its patchwork character shows. Moreover, Sigourney Weaver used her producer's credit to make changes which detract from the film.<br />  Ripley crashes on a planet which is a combination leadworks, prison, and monastery (three scripts there). Her fellow survivors from \\"Aliens\\" have perished (focusing all attention on Weaver). No ingenious gizmos or weapons are shown (reflecting Weaver's Luddite preferences).<br />  The only fine aspects of the film are Charles Dance's performance as a haunted ex-doctor, and Elliot Rosenthal's beautiful musical score. It's not enough.<br /><br />  Note: Since writing this review in 2003, a new \\"Director's Cut\\" of the film has been released.  While Alien 3 remains inferior to its two predecessors, the new cut makes this an altogether new and much-improved experience.  There is plot coherence here, improved editing and a better opening sequence than was theatrically-released years ago.  I would mildly recommend this one; you can toss the theatrical releases in the waste basket.
B00006JLX4|5.0|The very dry, stark, under-produced sound Pavement presented on Slanted and Enchanted, which went on to become their signature, certainly takes some getting used to.  It will likely seem boring and uninspired upon the first few listens, lacking any real emotional punch or vigor.  However, it can be very easy to grow into loving Pavement's sound for its honesty and subtle appeal.  The melodies are there, and there's something quietly poignant about the simplicity of Pavement's songs.  They rarely reach a truly &quot;rocking&quot; volume or tempo, but they make up for it in other ways, with earnest, good-hearted harmonies and vocals.  There is also certainly a catchiness factor involving their music, which makes a lot of their songs more listenable.  I think that they're comparable to the Pixies, in that though they are not immediately captivating, once a listener truly gives the band's material a listen, they will become absorbed in every one of their releases.  <br />It is also very easy to spot hooks, riffs, time signatures and overall song-structure which have influenced various 90's alternative rock bands, appearing slightly after Pavement.  Probably the most obvious of these bands would be Weezer, as both the lead singer's voice and many of the elements found throughout the songs are similar to those in Weezer's earlier songs.  Fans of Weezer will probably enjoy Pavement for this regard, and may even come to enjoy them more than Weezer--I know I did.  After you buy this spectacular first cd, you'll have grown accustomed to Pavement, and will probably love their music like so many others.  As for this re-issue, it's absolutely incredible, considering the price and amount of extras.  You will find several never-before-released tracks, as well as a few different versions of the old ones.  The sound quality is top-notch, and the huge (60pg) booklet is a nice addition.  Logically, buying the albums in their chronological order of release makes the most sense.  You'llbe paved in no time.
1559277246|4.0|I sit eagerly awaiting the next Stephanie Plum book; so let me begin by saying that Hard Eight is not my favorite of the series. I loved the humor in this volume it had me laughing out loud (as I had hoped for). Stephanie's adventure with her newest addition Kloughn had me ready to scream because he kept tagging along, but actually I came to love the scenes with him. I'm not giving a lot away by saying the dryer scene alone makes Kloughn one of the highlights of this episode in the Stephanie Plum series.<br />I may be one of the few though who found the last 50 or so pages to be a non-stop rush of events that built from her heated flirting with Ranger to a blink of an eye event that made me go back to make sure I hadn't skipped over some pages. The book flashed over a scene between Stephanie and Ranger that made you think \\"Wait, What happened?\\" It was like a cliffhanger that wasn't because you knew the answer but none of the facts. Let me just say Stephanie and Ranger have had some of the hottest flirting through several of the previous books and Hard Eight let it hit straight ice water. Nothing to do with the books but fans keep saying \\"Oh Ranger couldn't be relationship material\\" and this book gave in to those fans that have been waiting for that.  Why?  I love books with a mysterious hero who you don't know too much about but ends up being a good guy (which so far Ranger has been, he cares for Stephanie).  Consistently through this Volume Ranger is there watching out for her making sure she's got security, has bullets in her gun, he may tease her but doesn't treat her like she's stupid  and when she calls he is there without fail what's not to like?  If he is a bad why is he the \\"Primo\\" Bounty hunter and as mentioned through out the series the guy the cops want to be carrying a gun?  Ranger doesn't seem to be a thug and Hard Eight gave him a Hard Ride, now, he's not mysterious, but an \\"Opportunist\\" doesn't sound like the Ranger we've come to know and adore.  So he's got a never ending supply of expensive cars, he also owns office buildings, so he must have money or be making money if it's dirty show it to me!<br />  Abruzzi (the bad guy of the book) was scary and had me jumpy, but in only a few pages it was over.  And why aren't the cops doing anything about this guy?  Stephanie is the star of the series, but it looks like the bounty hunters (Stephanie/Ranger/Vinnie) take down more criminals than Joe (vice cop/homicide detective).  I do love Vinnie and was glad to see him back in this book.  This guy cracks me up.<br />The book seemed to heavily edited or something. I love that Janet usually has the book full of Stephanie's thoughts about everything that happens to her and in this book two rather major events went wham bam thank you ma'am fast without satisfying me. I'll read the book over and over because I love the series but it's not my favorite. The humor of the book held me though, so it is worth a try, but if you wonder like I did what happened in the ending you aren't alone...<br />The audio version is decent, but I was thrilled to discover that this time around CJ Critt was back with a version through Recorded Books.  After listening to her rendition of the book I was forced to raise my rating of 3 stars to 4 simply because there are things she brought to the story.<br />Unlike some I'll keep reading Janet as long as she keeps me laughing.

B00007KQA3|5.0|This movie is too good to describe. John Hurt is a man living in 1984 Earth which is controlled by \\"Big Brother\\". He falls in love with Suzanne Hamilton & commits a \\"sex crime\\". Hurt goes to room 101 & is tortured by O'Brien (Richard Burton) Gripping! Scary! Nail Biting! Even sensual at times. One of the most intriguing movies I ever saw! HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0385721234|5.0|A delightful, fun, easy to read novel that doesn't hesitate to disregard the natural laws of reality in order to improve the effect of a scene, like having its protagonist cry so much during her birth that the floor had to be swept for it was literally flooded with tears, to characters who behave more drastically and spontaneously than in reality in order to move the plot along, and yet, despite this, the characters, the plot, and the literal magic of Tita's cooking, somehow ring true to life on a more funadamental level, so that once you start, you won't be able to put it down.  A great book.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I have been a fan of Madoona From the first day I heard &quot;Everybody&quot; years ago!  With each change she makes, I have been there and grown with her. And it seems that I have said that she just can't get any better on every cd that she has maded.  This time is no exception!   I feel that for some that read this, they will think that since I am a loyal fan of hers that I will not speak the truth about her new cd &quot;American Life&quot;!  SO here goes!  You just need to trust me!  THIS CD IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE MADONNA CD!  I love the new sound that she has and I feel it is so personal.  There is not one song on here that I do not like!  I admit it is not the same as her past.  BUT WOW nothing can compare to this. Now everything I listen to seems dated on the radio!  I hope this cd has a very successful run on the radio!  But if it doesn't, I know that I will enjoy it for a very long time. And for those of you that have read some of the negative reviews.  I say you make your own decision.  I think you will be happy you gave this cd &quot;AMERICAN LIFE&quot; a chance!
0465011020|4.0|Kang displayed unique courage in sharing this bitter and horrific memoir with the world.  Revealing one's past as candidly and with such heartfelt generosity of spirit is a rare gift to readers.  The descriptions are not easy to read, and there are moments when the narrative thread seems to unravel, but overall Kang has provided an important view into the slave labor camps of North Korea.  It is a solemn and valuable reminder that humans can be so vicious that even evil grows banal.  Recommended for students of human rights across the globe as well as those interested in understanding North Korea.  David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\"
B000060P79|5.0|I thought this CD was great. Sure there are alot of bands out there with the same style of music, but none as good as these guys. This is one of those albums where almost every song is good. Definetly worth buying. Simple Plan rocks.
B000002NAK|4.0|I admit it, I'm not a Madonna fan, however being a lover of the musical theater, I have to say I was impressed with her in Evita and fell in love with the music.  If you liked the movie, get the soundtrack, it's as simple as that.
B00006RIO7|5.0|Not only is the movie the best of the year, but the soundtrack is great too!  My favorite song would have to be All That Jazz or Hot Honey Rag.  A must-buy!
B00005ASHM|5.0|I classify myself as a  classic rock fan, and although i do not think of Beach Boys as a classic rock band, no one can deny the importance and greatnes of this album. The Beach Boy's \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a line up of pure genius, coupled with the best lyrics the beach boys ever produced, and high quality harmony. I have heard all of the Beach boys Albums and Pet sounds is deffenetely their best. If you are new to the Beach Boys, Pet sounds is the way to go.
B00008S2VG|5.0|It doesn't have any immediate stand out tracks like ROL and Music, but this album grows beautifully with time. Forget all those comments about the lyrics, the music is ten times better than anything released nowadays in pop-world: from the harsh sincerity of I'm So Stupid to the dance beats of Nobody Knows Me, from the hilarious family reflection on Mother and Father to the electro-classical strings of Easy Ride. A must for Madonna fans and a nice experience for the rest.
B00000HZFH|2.0|It seems like its a requirement for indie bands to be completely safe and boring. This album is as bland as weezer's green album. Most of the songs sound the same and i can't hear any of the &quot;amazing catchy hooks&quot; people talk about either. I really liked thier stuff with caustic resin, well atleast now i know who the genius behind that was. If you want indie rock with a bit of flavor i recommend archers of loaf or pavement.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|...Fleetwood Mac on the other hand amazed me with the wonderful songs on this new CD.  I have listened to it so many times I have lost count.  Every song sounds new and fresh and powerful. <BR>They are still the best band going! \\"Destiny Rules\\" and \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" are two of my favorites.<br />But \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" still moves me. I saw Buckingham play that during their last tour and the emotions he puts into his writing shows in his playing. He is so under rated.  For anyone who is considering buying this CD, buy two, you may wear out the first one. Yes, it is that good. Enjoy!!!
0441172717|5.0|For anyone who even remotely enjoys sci-fi, they should pick up this book.  But it is not for people who think sci-fi should be &quot;all action, all dialogue, non-stop.&quot;  Because Dune is a far cry from action. It has it's moments of intense action at times, but for the most of it, it delves into the inner-workings of baronies and empires, the thoughts of young dukes and old planetoligists, and the struggle against tyranny. There are characters you will hate, characters you can do nothing but love, and some characters will seem so unimportant you forget them, only to have them come back at the end. <BR>All in all, I reccomend this book so highly, I think 5 stars is a rude understatement.  I believe this to be the best book ever written (that I've read.) Buying this book is a must.
B000002UC5|5.0|When this was released there was a huge cry from the critics of the pyschadelic generation. They expected another &quot;Sgt. Pepper's?&quot;<br />As it stands, the melodies in this album are simply beautiful. &quot;Every Night&quot;, &quot;Singalong Junk&quot;, and &quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; are worth the price of the album. There is no &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; politics about this album, but then again, John's solo albums seldom matched Paul's for listenability. This album is simply a man, a cornerstone of the greatest rock band ever, trying to come to terms with his new life, he's seeking a new identity, not as a Beatle, but simply as Paul McCartney, husband to Linda (hence a few simple songs in praise of his beau).<br />At the same time John was 'writing' stuff which though equally 'honest' is saturated with primal screams (thanks to musical 'genius' Yoko Ono).
B0000640VO|5.0|I live in Paris in Europe, and I've seen it under &quot;Amélie Poulain&quot;. This is just one of the so most wonderfull movie ever. It really change my life, how amelie is able to pass you thru another world. She's just a normal girl who decided to change her life. She changes the life of other actors in the film but also spectators (means YOU). <br />Also, for you americans, you will discover some parts of Paris that thru this film are now &quot;celebrity&quot;. Specialy the café, which is really a typical of Paris &quot;une brasserie&quot;.<br />Enjoy this movie.<BR>Je l'aime, et l'adore.<BR>Panjas
B000002C1V|2.0|The follow-up to &quot;The Wall&quot;, &quot;The Final Cut&quot; is, when considered with its predecessor, a musical let-down. It's also without Pink Floyd's keyboardest, Wright, who was kicked out of the band at this time.<br />I've seen the limited video EP that accompanied this album and putting pictures to the music doesn't add to it.<br />I am a Pink Floyd fan (Meddle is my favourite album; so I guess I prefer their earlier stuff).
B00006J3WH|5.0|Dear Joss: It is difficult to write scripts for a tv series that will continue to entertain and delight week after week and year after year. Intelligence is needed. This show demonstrated that fact. But it is even harder to produce a musical based on a show like \\"Buffy\\" and expect the music to be good or the actors/characters to be good at singing songs in the dramatic flow. Joss, you did it again! This a great CD! Based on the hit series and probably one of the most memorable episodes post 'The Gentlemen\\" the songs are good throughout the album. Careful work was done so that the characters did not overdo or act out of their roles and this was a smart move. Some of the cuts are really great, of note is Anthony Stewart Head's song that tenders the words \\"Believe me I don't want to go..wish I could say the right words to make you understand,etc.\\" and the song by Willow's lover. There is also a combo song with Giles and Willow's girlfriend that is excellent and is a portent of events to come. One of the best CD's of the year. Deserves major recognition and is a great example of what can be done if you put one great mind (Joss) to it! 5 STARS
0385495323|5.0|You will definitely enjoy this book. Beginning with Caesar, touching on Enigma in WWII, and ending with RSA and quantum cryptography, Simon Singh does an excellent job of tracing the history of secret communication. You will find this book enjoyable and enlightening. You will learn how your credit card number is sent securely online and how to send email that can't be read but by only one person. You will also learn about the ongoing debate of how secure encryption should be allowed to be. A wonderful book that assumes no previous knowledge but leaves you with so much information, THE CODE BOOK is a must-have for anyone.
B00005JLKN|4.0|This movie has to be by far the best in the Lecter series. Edward Norton does a great job as Will Graham, and Hopkins of course is unforgettable as Lecter himself. This movie gives insight as to the background of Hannibal before he winds up in prison before he meets Starling. Ralph Finnes is okay as the &quot;tooth fairy.&quot; If you're looking for gore though, try another movie.
B00008S2VH|5.0|This CD is a great follow-up to Madonna's previous album, MUSIC. This CD is more guitarish. It still has all the dancy-funk of MUSIC. I recently picked this up in Times Square and recieved a free poster with my purchase. If you get this CD, get the special edition. It's only a little bit more but has extra stuff! I think this CD will sell a lot of copies. It's really good. I bought this without knowing ANYTHING about the album and without hearing any of the songs. (Actually, I had heard Die Another Day before and really liked it, but had no idea it was on this CD!) I really recommend this CD to anyone and everyone! My favorite songs are the title track, AMERICAN LIFE, NOBODY KNOWS ME (which sounds like it could have come straight off of the MUSIC cd), DIE ANOTHER DAY, NOTHING FAILS, and HOLLYWOOD. I really like how Madonna's singing is kinda distorted and all of the mixing that goes on on the CD. Pick this CD up, you won't regret it! It's AWESOME!!!!!!!!! 5 stars, two thumbs up, A++!!!!! ENJOY!
B00003CXCD|5.0|There are few movies ever made that come even close to rivaling the sheer charm of &quot;Roman Holiday.&quot;  It is a rare example of a perfect film.<br />Audrey Hepburn is so very beautiful that she could melt stone, which is exactly why Gregory Peck is perfect playing opposite her.  He is the only leading man of his days that could possibly not fall in love with Princess Ann from the very first moment he meets her.  The romance is helped along by the on-location shooting in Rome, with some very lovely locations.  &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; has such a simple story, and such an uncomplicated feeling, that one is free to simply be in love with everything.<br />The DVD is well worth owning, as the restored Black and White is by far the best print I have seen, including theatrical showings.  Nice extra features including a few interesting documentaries.
0385720920|2.0|I forget how i came across this book, maybe it had to do with fight club, a great film. i never read the book. anyway, about the book. it jumps around way too much. the beginning was a chore to read and get used to. i dont see what all the hoopla is about with this, it really isnt anything great. there are some original ideas in it, that are weird. Chuck writes some interesting sentences, some good descriptions, but i didnt find the plot very satisfying. its just okay, nothing great. oh well, hope this helped.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I've followed Fleetwood Mac since the 70's. When I purchased this album, I was skeptical as to if it would be just more of the same. I did not want to hear songs written years ago, from another time, that were just now being released. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was fresh, kicky, interesting and so much fun. Though one member is missing, the remaining have given 110% and sound fantastic. This album is up there with the best of their works. Yes, they have changed some, but so have the rest of us. This is absolutely a &quot;must have&quot; for all Fleetwood Mac fans.
6304698542|5.0|This is the best movie musical ever made in my opinion , Bob Fosse is a true legend , the sheer life of the story and the performances all add up to an amazing movie.
0156027321|5.0|What a wonderfully unique and absolutely refreshing piece of fiction this is! A little novel truly out of the ordinary - I was glued to it - it is so mesmerizing! For any teachers out there - it would probably make for a great novel to study at the highschool level; plenty of material to analyse here!!!<BR>Read it! Read it! Read it!!
B00005JLSE|5.0|I have been waiting so long for Chicago to hit the screen and boy was it worth it , the cast are so suited and the music has never sounded better , Trust me this was worthy of Best Picture and Catherine Zeta Jones what a voice!
B00005JLET|5.0|The genius of this film is its utter narrative originality: while it seems indisputably like Japanese fairy tales (in its particulars of spiritual machinery) and may even remind you of Northern European fairy tales (in its setting and the tribulations the heroine must go through), it also seems like nothing else you've ever seen. Best of all, while its exceptionally intelligent and offers a profound allegory about class (in its heroine's need to work to survive, and the greedy system she works under), it never seems moralistic or preachy in the least. And nothing is never what it seems to be: eschewing the easy good and evil dualities of American cartoons, the characters the heroine encounters are complex and ambiguous in their morality. No one is a clear villain or hero, and someone who can give her her greatest aid at one minute can suddenly become a threat to her life.    The young heroine, Chihiro, matures in the course of the film from a clingy and even irritatingly whining young girl to someone more mature and self-reliant, but her transformation is gradual and believable. When her parents are transformed into pigs by the magics of a mysterious recreational village for spirits that they stumble across, Chihiro must work from the literal bottom of a spooky and mysterious tower which functions as a bathing house for spirits and demons. The bathhouse tower is a kind of Gothic miracle, populated by all kinds of creatures that you've never seen before and remind you of nothing else (such as the enchanted furnace smudges required to carry inidivual coals). And the film is replete with great moments of beauty that the director, Miyazaki, is not afraid to linger on: a train gliding over a flooded empty landscape, or seagulls circling far below the heroine's feet (yet over a beautiful blue sea) as she climbs to the top of the mysterious tower. This isn't like anything else you've ever seen before.
0790729628|3.0|i don't buy this &quot;director's cut&quot; business. despite what critics have panned as a &quot;forced voice-over&quot;, there are some important descriptive narratives in the original theatrical release. when bryant refers to replicants as &quot;skin jobs&quot; and we understand the derogatory implications via voice over, this is all lost without the narrative. <BR>i want the original. plain and simple.
6305546789|5.0|Firstoff Halloween(1978)is my favorite example of showing you can make a top notch hit with a low budget...)without the hollywood [movies] they tend to make now for 10 million a film. Halloween is John Carpenter's masterpiece that is about a highly mental and troubled boy(Michael Myers)who completely loses it on Halloween night and kills his sister Judith Myers,keep in mind this when Michael is a child 8 years of age. Later is taken away from custody of his family and placed in a top-notch pyshcahitric ward. Next after waiting for 20 years of not talking,barely eating,and sitting in a corner of silence. He plans to come home on Halloween. Well most of you have seen the classic,I won't ruin it for the rest. BOTTOM LINE,A HIGH QUALITY WITH THX SUPERIOR SOUND AND PICTURE QUALITY,AWESOME EXTRAS(CAST/BIOS,TRAILERS/TV SPOTS,HALLOWEEN THEME TO LISTEN TO,AND MANY MORE,AWESOME CAST(JAMIE LEE CURTIS(TRUE LIES,A FISH CALLED WANDA)DONALD PLEASENCE(PRINCE OF DARKNESS)AND GREAT FILM WRITER/PRODUCER JOHN CARPENTER(THE THING),...P.S THEY WOULD BE NONE OF THE [copies] THEY CALL SCARY TODAY(SCREAM,I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST,SIXTH SENSE,BLAIR WITCH,THE RING,BLOODY MURDER)IF IT WEREN'T FOR HALLOWEEN,(BETTER TO STICK TO CULT CLASSICS NOT THE TEENYBOOPER [stuff] IN THE 9O'S AND BEYOND YEARS)
B000002H33|5.0|There are no words to express how truly awesome this masterpiece is. I will break it down song by song to show you. Hopefully this gets read by someone.<br />Battery- Great opener. Really Heavy. Starts out with the acoustic intro and goes into chaos. 10/10<br />Master of Puppets- Another great song. A little lengthy though. 9/10<br />Thing that should not be- Worst on the album. Still good just not my favorite. 7/10<br />Welcome Home (sanitarium)- Awesome Ballad. Gets hevy at the end(like most of their slower stuff) 10/10<br />Disposable Heroes.- Same as Master of Puppets- Really good but too long 8/10<br />Leper Messiah- Good. A little slow. 8.5/10<br />Orion- Awesome! 10/10<br />Damage inc. Their Heaviest ever. Really great. And Just over 5 minutes! 10/10<br />To sum it all up, really great CD. Best album ever... Metallica Rules!
0060537639|1.0|All right, I don't know any Medieval Chinese history, so I'm open to this story at the beginning.   But I'm from Missouri, so when, on page 415, I find &quot;the Mississippi River west of Kansas City&quot; that old show-me attitude really kicks in, and I go on my voyage of discovery on the Internet to find the sites debunking Menzies.  And I don't even need to translate them from the Portuguese.  The ideas in the book are interesting, even though perhaps this &quot;history&quot; should be reclassified as fiction.
B00000JCB2|4.0|First of all i would like to say that I WAS a fan. Was. As in not anymore. This actually has some good songs on it(Break Stuff, No Sex, Dont Go off wandering). It also has some really lame songs (nookie, n2gether now)but this is the disk to ge if you want to get into these guys. Choco Starfish is good but not freat. THree Dollar Bill is justplain weird and really hard to get into. Don't buy it brand new. You can pick this one up used really cheap. This is bizkit at their best. New Old Songs...
B000002SYG|5.0|Culture Club was a smash in the early/mid 80's with a string of successful pop hits. They are still one of the most remembered pop groups to come out of the 80's. This is a great collection for such a cheap price considering it's loaded with hits. Of course, you get their signature #1 hit from 1984 \\"Karma Chameleon.\\" Definitely an 80's favorite of mine. You also get the top 5 hit ballad \\"Do You Really Want To Hurt Me\\" which is also very recognizable. Other top 10 hits include the catchy \\"Miss Me Blind,\\" \\"Time (Clock of the Heart),\\" \\"Church of the Poison Mind,\\" and another of my personal favorites \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya.\\" I also really like \\"Move Away\\" and even \\"The War Song.\\" Any fan of 80's pop music or pop in general should be on the look-out for this collection!
B00007JVBI|5.0|This is a well put together Cat Power record. In my opinion, it has the same flow of 1996's &quot;What Would the Community Think.&quot;  So if you like that one you should pick this up too.  Forgive me for mentioning this, but I'm sure you already know that Eddie Vedder and Dave Grohl make little cameos on this record.  I think that is great.  They are both reported Cat Power fans, so its cool that they would get a chance to work with her.  However, I truly wish that nobody would have brought this up.  I was totally distracted from the music on the first listen because it became this hunt to find Eddie's vocals or Dave's drumming, and when I found them I was like &quot;thats it?&quot;  I mean it's good that they didn't have these overbearing contributions, but I think if I would have not read any press about the album and had simply picked it up at the store, then I would have just thought that one of Chan's friends sang a little on the song &quot;To Be a Good Woman&quot; and that would have been that, and there would be no big name attatched.  And as for Dave's drumming, whether Grohl aficionados agree with me or not, I did not notice any outstanding drumming that would make me think &quot;wow, who did that?&quot; (which was probably the intent when recording) So all in all, its a Cat Power record.  A few more mid-tempo songs thrown in, and like I said before, it bears the same mood as &quot;What Would the Community Think.&quot;  But now that you have read my review, you also have been tainted by the thought of big names making cameos on the album.  So my advice to you is to deal with it until you are accustomed to the idea.  Then get on the internet and download live Cat Power sessions of the song &quot;To Be A Good Woman.&quot; It sounds more emotional without all of the overdub vocals and violins anyway.<br />-Brandon
B000089A07|1.0|Red Dragon is a huge [failure]. The acting is so bad that you seem to watch a comedy. The killer is ridiculous compared to the one in Michael Mann's Manhunter(judge for yourself). This is really not a good movie and don't think to be scared because nothing is spooky (except for a flashback of a doll's eyes).But the worse is that the director is very pretentious (you see that in the extras).Buy Manhunter and forget Red Dragon.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A good album, but still gets five stars in my opinion. Not as good as anything King Crimson did in the past, especially albums In the Court of the Crimson King and/or their new one The Power to Believe which if Radiohead played this material the critics would be foaming at the mouths....<br />It is true that there are certainly better records that have been made in the last 30 years... An overrated indie rock band to say the least but, I still like them, especially this one, O.K. Computer.<br />First of all, to all of the critical darlings who rated this album so highly as being one of the all time greatest British rock albums of all time, WHY??? What is so unique about the concept? The music, the lyrics?<br />This topic of machines taking over the universe is far from a fresh idea, (computers of todays, Robots of the past) but it is the way that Radiohead mixes great melody, singing from Thom Yorke (his best up until now) and production that makes this listen a very enjoyable one. Glad to see the return of album oriented rock returning to the collective consciences of rock music listeners. <br />If you enjoyed O.K. Computer, and who didn't?, then you need to pick up ANYTHING by Porcupine Tree especially the new one In Absentia and if given the opportunity, can (sigh) blow the Electronica styled Radiohead right out of the water...
B00008OLYN|4.0|Damnation is the softest album Opeth has put out. It's haunting melodies with Mikael's beautiful voice over acoustics is just awesome. If you like Opeth, but dont really care for the low growls or &quot;black metal&quot; side, then you'll love this album. Definately a must have for any fan of Opeth or mellower music.
B000002MJ0|5.0|Loveless may be their best, but if you're new to My Bloody Valentine, it's definately not the place to start. Don't get me wrong, it's a very fine album, but My Bloody Valentine have a sound like no other, and you should probably buy this first, it's the best starting point for getting into them. It is a fantastic album, and one no shoegazing collection should be without.
B000022TSW|5.0|OK, to my knowledge there isn't a Criterion version of this movie in the works, but by God there should be. What are you laughing at?<br />When I first saw this movie in theaters it was - and still is - the only movie that I literally laughed nonstop from start to finish. People may not want to put it on the same scale of genius as Citizen Kane, probably because Orson Wells didn't use cheap animation and over 400 vulgarities, but that doesn't make any less of a great movie. Everything about this movie was inventive and pure genius, from the film's premise of the South Park kids seeing a crudely made, vulgar animated movie to the inclusion of Sadam Hussain to the absolute brilliant idea of making it a musical (by the way, \\"Blame Canada,\\" should have beaten that Phil Collins Tarzan song for the Oscar, if only for Robin Williams' performance of the song during the telecast).<br />That being said, with only three trailers as extras, this DVD really doesn't do the movie justice. And since it came out about the same time that distributors started doing the \\"deluxe\\" and \\"ultimate\\" editions (how many copies of the Terminator movies have you bought?), I just assumed that Paramount would eventually do the same thing with this movie. But to date this hasn't happened, so I finally broke down and bought it and I'm glad I did. Every time I watch it I laugh harder.<br />And my letter writing campaign to Criterion continues.<br />La Resistance!
6305165912|5.0|This movie gets funnier the more times you watch it.  The first time I watched it, I was amused, everytime since it gets funnier and funnier.
B00008S2VH|3.0|None of the songs on this album are particularly memorable.  In fact, the songs on this album sound as if they are the ones that didn't make it onto Ray of Light.  I liked some of the songs on American Life, however, after I listened to it, I popped an entirely different Madonna CD into my CD player: The Immaculate Collection.  I wish Madonna would reinvent her sound and stop cultivating this techno sound that she has stuck with for two albums now.
B00008OLYN|5.0|Accualy I had the cd over a month ago so don't hate me, you can have it now.  I eagerly awaited its arrival since last year around this time.  It was originally supposed to be a double album release wth Deliverance, but due to contractual BS this album has been ready for a while but waiting in the wings.  <BR>This is a beautiful album and belongs in every rock fans collection.  the death metal vocals and double bass drumming that filled Deliverance are completly gone, and instead contains all the feeling that it's companion piece missed.  The music itself is new and does not sound like any of the \\"softer\\" Opeth songs like Benighted, or Still Day...  They are a fresh new direction that leaves me awaiting to time travel and go to the release date for the next album.  Having not heard Camel or Steve Hackett,  I cant aspouse a connection between their music and Opeth's.  However fans of the obscure late Nick Drake, can find a kindred soul in the compositions of Akerfeldt and Co.<BR>While all the songs are great, tracks 2, 3 and five stand out in my mind most.  Im disappointed because I heard there were 10 tracks recorded, but the eight that there are here are beautful.  Opeth is on tour in the US again and Im wondering  how different the show will be.  The new direction also begs the question, where will they go next?  <br />In addition to this album, I would recommed, Porcupine Tree's In Absenita, Nick Drake's Five Leaves Left and Buckethead's Colma and Electric Tears cd's.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Her maturity clearly shows on this CD.  I think its powerful and shows her true skills as an artists.  No wonder she's been an icon for generations.
B00008OLYN|4.0|I bought this album on a whim having never heard Opeth, but having read acclaims to their work. It sounds like it could have been made 30 years ago. I hear the King Crimson album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" and early Sabbath stuff like \\"Planet Caravan\\" and \\"Solitude.\\" The songs are mellow and the guitars sound great. The drumming sounds great. The mellotron and stuff really give it an aged feel like that first Crimson album. I later searched the Internet for other Opeth stuff and was surprised at what I heard. I now realize this is a special release and uncharacteristic of what I've heard on the \\"Deliverance\\" album. If you like Opeth before, this may be different for you, but it sounds great. Give it a shot!
B00005JKZT|5.0|This movie overwhelmed me in every way. It was quite simply the most fantastic film of 2002. It also beats out it's predecessor, The Fellowship Of The Ring, and that movie was brilliant as well. There is so much to enjoy in this movie, and though it is rip-roaringly entertaining, it also brings much intensity and subtlety to the story, so we care about the outcome of events and what happens to the characters. I am a reviewer who hasn't yet read the books (though some day I hope I have the patience to read the apparently brilliant works of Tolkien) so I am finding the story unpredictable and amazing as it goes along. If you're looking for a reviewer who knows what happens in the long run, then go down the page more and find one. I'm reviewing the movie, not the book.<br />The thing that makes The Two Towers a masterpiece is its amazing ability to mix stunning how-...-did-they-do-that action sequences while also bringing us closer to the characters and making them more developed. The battle at Helms Deep is the most intense, amazingly produced and brilliant action sequence we're likely to see this decade. And wasn't it amazing how the writers managed to develop Arwen (Liv Tyler) further than they did in the first movie in a matter of about 7 MINUTES? An amazing achievement. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli have to work together and their faith is also developed and questioned throughout the feature. Frodo is being more drawn into the ring and Sam is becoming more than the companion. All of these things are acted very well, and the character developments brilliant, but it's none of these characters who are developed the most in this movie. In fact, the character who we explore most in TTT wasn't even in the first movie -<br />GOLLUM. He is an amazing character. Andy Serkis did much of his scenes himself before they were visualed up, and he deserves a Best Supporting Actor award at any ceremony this year. He was just incredible! He made Gollum a threatening but also loveableand sympathetic character to indentify with. It's also noted that the movie's best scene is obviously Gollum/Smeagol's conversation - this is the most character developing scene of any movie so far in 2002. What an amazing scene!<br />That scene is also followed up for \\"BEST TTT SCENE\\" by Legolas so cooly jumping on a horse just before battle (see it to believe it), Gandalf getting Saruman out of King Theodon and obviously the battle at Helm's Deep, which will most definitely go down in history as one of the most amazing sequences ever put to film.  <br />Almost everything about TTT is better than FOTR - more action, better acting, better special effects and much better writing. All of these elements combined make a modern classic. The music is also much better here, and the Celtan quality to the Rohan theme is awesome. If you're one of the, say, about, 5 PEOPLE, who hasn't seen this amazing piece of film yet - rush to your local multiplex NOW.<br />I am also faithful that Jackson and crew will be able to produce an even more amazing DVD than FOTR - if that's possible!
B00008S2VF|4.0|Well, this CD is better than her previous album \\"Music\\" in many ways.  First off it seems more polished overall, but c'mon Madonna, only 11 tracks?  Actually if you count the recycled \\"Die Another Day\\" it would only be 10.  In any case the tracks that are there sound good, and like I said, this is one of few albums I can actually listen to all the way through.  You'll find a mix of hip string electric beats, and the ocassional acoustic rendered tune.  While the lyrics may not always be the most sensible or coherent, the music and beats are top notch. The thing is that Madonna tries to mix it up in variety and style to keep the album sounding new and fresh, and while not everyone may like that, it suits this album just fine.  Good Job on a nice addition to your discography Madonna!!!
B000002U82|2.0|I used to listen to Pink Floyd in High School and college. It is music that is meant to be listened to in an altered state, if you know what I mean :-) But, the fact is, now at the age of 33, I would never pop in a pink floyd album. The music is dull, pessimistic, and it drones on folks.<br />Bottom line: If you are under 22, still in college--buy it.<BR><BR>Adults with any Self-worth and sense of hope = don't buy it!<br />BTW=I gave it two stars b/c some of the songs, while in college, were pretty cool.
B000007491|5.0|This is the 1970 self-titled album that started it all for Supertramp (NOT \\"Crime Of The Century,\\" which many U.S. fans mistake as the group's debut disc). Some fans may be in for a shock when hearing this album for the first time, as it's by far the most psychedelic, art-rock album in the band's catalog. There's no trace of jazz leanings or saxophone anywhere, OR any lead vocals by Rick Davies (though he does play), and lots and lots of organ. There's even a brief detour into avant-garde experimental noodling. It's a far cry from \\"Breakfast In America,\\" but don't let that throw you off. This is an absolutely fantastic album, one of the band's best. Believe me, you've never heard Supertramp ROCK like this before. For the first line-up of Supertramp, singer/bassist Roger Hodgson (who was not yet the lead guitarist) and keyboardist Rick Davies are joined by guitarist Richard Palmer & drummer Bob Miller (and, as already mentioned, there's no sax player yet). This four-piece version of Supertramp is outstanding, and their 1970 debut album is a stunning one. After the short-but-sweet acoustic intro of \\"Surely,\\" the band rip into \\"It's A Long Road,\\" a totally cookin', punchy rocker that never fails to amaze. The instrumental bridge alone is mesmerizing, with the band locking into their instruments like a four-headed machine, but from the first note to the last, this song is a true unsung 'Tramp classic. After the brief organ intro of \\"Au Bade\\" comes \\"And I'm Not Like Other Birds Of Prey,\\" a lovely Hodgson number. \\"Words Unspoken\\" is a simply dreamy tune, and \\"Maybe I'm A Beggar,\\" featuring guitarist Palmer on co-lead vocals with Hodgson, is another psychedelic gem. Hodgson's \\"Home Again\\" is brief but very nice. The band continue rocking out with gusto on \\"Nothing To Show,\\" and \\"Shadow Song\\" is another winning ballad from Hodgson. Then comes the album's centerpiece, \\"Try Again,\\" a 12-minute art-rock masterwork that, like \\"It's A Long Road,\\" allows the band to really flex their muscles (and it also gives them a brief, experimental King Crimson-ish moment toward the end---strange, but it works). It's a jaw-droppingly great piece, another 'Tramp buried treasure. Finally, the band concludes with a longer version of \\"Surely,\\" and it's a fine album-closer. From beginning to end, the band's chemistry here is superb. Hodgson's falsetto voice, like always, is wonderful, and he plays a mean bass on this one. Rick Davies has yet to show the world his vocal abilities, but his keyboard/organ playing throughout is awesome. And, in their only album with the band, Palmer's guitar-playing is terrific (and his vocals on \\"Maybe I'm A Beggar\\" are quite good as well), while Bob Miller is a pure powerhouse on the skins.I love all of the band's music, but \\"Supertramp\\" really stands apart from the rest of their work, and in more ways than one. I sincerely hope that 'Trampheads who still think that the band started with \\"Crime Of The Century\\" will pick up this album (as well as the band's second disc, \\"Indelibly Stamped\\"). Until they do, they are totally missing out on something special here. \\"Supertramp\\" is Hodgson, Davies & company as you've never heard them before, and never will again. As the band's lone detour into psychedelic rock, it sure is different, but it is totally outstanding stuff.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Compiled after John Lennon's death (but before Harrison's), it is amazing how this 12-hour documentary seems to capture his personality, presence, and participation. The thoughtful (and at times playful) editing of mucho miles of archival film and recent interview footage makes it possible to feel like each Beatle received equal attention. Perhaps because John was often the group's spokesperson during their heyday, he is amply represented by talkshow clips (including an interview with a very young David Frost).<br />Because the film covers only the decade in which the Beatles were the Beatles (post-Beatles careers are not discussed or analyzed), but does so from a 30+ year vantage point, the film serves as a very interesting study on memory. The surviving Beatles remember events (recording sessions, concerts, conversations, etc.) quite differently, and there is no impartial third-party commentator to enlighten the audience. It is very much like being at a family reunion--it's the quality and depth of the relationships that count, not the accuracy of the events recalled. In some cases, however, original footage contradicts a Beatle's memory. It is these lapses of memory, the humble and honest self-assessments, the willingness to forgive, the cherishing of what exisited and was special, and a mature perspective on fame and success that make this film a joy to watch. It's gratifying that Paul, George, and Ringo did not become like the \\"late Elvis\\" (a fear they admit to in the film). Yes, they became a little mellow with age. But they didn't cease to be interesting, thoughtful, or creative.<br />This film is accurately called an \\"anthology.\\" The archival footage is generous. In most cases two or more full songs from a single concert are captured. And there are generous clips from all of their movies. Also of interest are the mini-films the Beatles made when they later tired of touring. They sent these films to television shows in their stead, allowing them to stay home with their growing families and avoid the screaming fans. In essence, they invented the music-video, a mainstay of the pop music industry today.<br />Towards the end of Part 8, the final segment, Paul observes that \\"looking back, almost every song was about love. That's a very positive thing. You can't argue with that, right?\\" The Beatles were revolutionary in so many ways, but they were never nihilists.with their growing families and avoid the screaming fans.

B00005JKZT|5.0|I did not read this series of books (not liking fantasy or SF), but someone gave me the \\"Lord of the Ring\\" DVD and I was hooked.  The \\"Two Towers\\" is just as good, better in some ways, and I know the \\"Return of the King\\" will not disappoint.  The \\"Two Towers\\" has the most glorious music, adventure, wonderful acting, and spectacular visual effects.  I have now read the books and enjoyed them very much.<BR>You can't go wrong with this series of movies.  Can't wait until the DVD of \\"The Towers\\" is out.  I will be one of the lst to purchase it.
B00005UW9T|5.0|this is the best animated movie i've ever seen, it beats even the little mermaid!!! who cares if it's historically inaccurate, it's the animation and voices that make it wonderful!!! i loved the song at the beginning and the song journey to the past.  meg ryan does a wonderful job voicing anya, and john cusack makes dimitri irresitable!!  if you are looking for something to watch with your kids, or if you're a teenager (like me) this is the movie to see.  it's funny, romantic, and makes you wonder if this would've happened had anastasia survived.<br />once again, if it beats the little mermaid (but not the songs, the little mermaid has the best songs), you know it has to be the best animated movie out there!!!<br />plus, dimitri is hot!!!
B00008S2VG|4.0|I heard the leak of this album and was initially disappointed.  I was hoping for something along the ROL lines.  I never really got into the material on Music.  But since I am a fan, I bought the CD anyway.  I cannot stop listening.  Songs which I initially thought were disjointed and not catchy are imbedded in my brain.  There are probably more radio friendly songs than on the last CD.  Let's hope Madonna releases the right ones to help sales of this CD.  The highlights for me are Hollywood, Nobody Knows Me, Nothing Fails, Intervention, Die Another Day.  I'm not sure I can tell the difference between Love Profusion and X-static Process yet, but I like it/them.  Mother and Father...well I can do without that one.
B00000AFFF|1.0|I guess the universal acclaim and number of 5-stars reviews talk for themselves, but this is an album I GOT to tell my opinion about. I bought it at its release in 1998. I can assure that I did work quite hard on it, but finally had to give in. Now, for the first time in a couple of years, I have been giving it a new try. Frankly, I have not changed my opinion, regarding it an unbearable listening experience. First, in spite of the brilliance of the production, what kind of songs is this really? They do sound rather melodic, all right. But then, how come I can't possibly MEMORIZE any of them, no matter how many times i hear them? The music just seems to run like sand through my fingers, only to leave me sad and empty. Is it really the case that all you people who praise this album actually is able to whistle, sing, hum and memorize these songs? If so, I am impressed. Still I feel the right to say that in my opinion, popular music shouldn't ble like this. Then it's the monotony. Every song sounds more or less the same. I am surprised to see that the album has a total running time of 52 minuits. Because of the monotony it seems to go on and on for an eternity. On top of it all, Elvis' vocals. Never have I heard his voice so unbearably strained and irksome. It's like torture to my ears. All in all, an enormous disappointment to me. But then, what can be expected from two gentlemen who both lost the spark many years ago?
B000000WA4|5.0|This should definately be concider a major work of art, for it is one of the most compelling epics I've ever listened to outside of Progressive, yet even melding some of its elements. This dual CD is one of the most impressive works of the 90s, containing the beautiful Piano opening and closing Title-Track, and such grand highlights such as the string-heavy Grammy-winning &quot;Tonight, Tonight&quot;, the heavy Zero and Bullet With Butterfly Wings, the new wave ballad 1979, plus tons of other awesome songs: XYU, 33, Porcelina, Thru The Eyes of Ruby, Here is No Why, and more. The only flaw is Corgan's annoying voice, but you'll get used to it thanks to the beautiful instruments that accompany it. Another thing is that it might be difficult to always sit through 2 hours of music. But besides this, it's highly reccomendable if you like huge multi-ganre epics with Progressive tints here and there.
B0000026JR|4.0|what a cd this is...strap on your seatbelts folks, its a ride on space mountain! this cd rocks from top to bottom...title track rules...and riot fan should have this one...its a nobrainer of a choice...top notch melodic speed metal way ahead of its time....only compliant is the vocalist whos voice gets a bit on your nerves if taken in large doses similar to the effects of paul stanley or ozzy...listen to a couple of songs then switch to something else and come back later and listen some more...thats my best advice...could be better, but not by much...instruments and played perfectly....if you like the earlier fates warning stuff, get this cd!
B000000OMB|3.0|Some sections of the following review have been fictionalized for the reader's pleasure...<br />Listen up folks!  This is the first album I ever purchased.  A few months earlier, I'd been given a copy of R.E.M.'s Fables of the Reconstruction, but Asia's self-titled debut was the first album (along with Boston's Third Stage) on which I actually spent my own hard-earned money.  It was the summer of 1986 and I was just another high school kid putting in hard time at my local Hardees as a \\"day porter\\".  Day porter was the job no one wanted because it combined unloading the supply truck at 5 AM, cooking fries or burgers during the lunch rush, and generally working with garbage.  Each afternoon, I came home reeking of grease and garbage, the way only a day porter can.  In return for all the sweeping, mopping, trashcan-emptying, and furtive groping at the hands of one of the cashiers, I received less than four bucks an hour.<br />One evening shortly after my 16th birthday, I knifed through the balmy night air in my parents' white Reliant K on a clandestine mission to my local K-Mart.  My parents were not crazy about me spending the money I was earning at Hardees on trifles, so my mission to enhance my music collection had to be conducted in complete secrecy.  Once inside the K-Mart, I spent at least an hour contemplating the bewildering options at hand before settling on Asia's self-titled debut and Boston's Third Stage.<br />New purchases in hand, I returned to my car, popped Asia in my cassette deck and headed out onto Bypass Road.  Unfortunately, at the first stoplight, the Reliant K sputtered out.  After 5 minutes of futilely turning the ignition, I gave the sled up for dead in the middle of the road and ran back to K-Mart where I called my parents from a pay phone.  I felt as though I were being punished for my wasteful spending habits.  <br />Back at the car 10 minutes later, I found a policeman giving it the once over.  He asked me if it was my car and I nodded in the affirmative.  The cop grabbed me by the nape of the neck and slammed my head against the Reliant's hood.  Blood gushing from my forehead like a young Jon Ritchie, I mustered up just enough strength to pull away briefly.  In return, I received a right uppercut to the jaw and a knee to the stomach that left me doubled over and gasping for breath.  Once I'd been properly subdued, the cop offered me several Hydrox cookies and a styrofoam cup of Diet Rite soda.  He went back to his patrol car and made a call.  When he returned, he was apologetic.  He said that I bore an unfortunate resemblance to a burglar wanted on the south side of town and that in \\"the heat of the moment\\", he had made a regrettable snap decision to beat me up and ask questions later.  In his \\"wildest dreams\\", he'd never imagined he would assault an innocent teenager and admitted that he was now \\"one step closer\\" to the suspension his supervisor had threatened him with a month earlier when he was the \\"sole survivor\\" of a showdown with a knife-wielding hobo.  For the sake of his wife and children's continued prosperity, I agreed to tell my parents that I'd incurred my injuries by tripping and falling into a patch of briars and brambles along the highway median.<br />When my dad arrived, he was shocked by my bloody visage, though seemed to buy the briar patch excuse.  He quickly surmised that I'd simply flooded the Reliant by giving it too much gas and that it would soon be operational again.  He thanked the cop for looking out for me and before we knew it, we were headed back home.<br />Pretty exciting story, isn't it?  If only Asia's self-titled debut was equally as exciting.  On a lark, I recently decided to purchase a used copy of the CD for sentimental purposes.  How does it sound 15 years after I bought that first copy on tape?  A whole lot cheesier than it used to, that's for sure.  I must admit the first cut, \\"Heat of the Moment\\", is still as rocking as ever, \\"Only Time Will Tell\\" remains irresistible, and \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Here Comes the Feeling\\" still have their charms.  Nevertheless, between the often wince-inducing lyrics and very 80s keyboard riffs, some of these songs are pretty embarrassing for me to be listening to here in the new millennium.  When was the last time you heard something as awful as \\"Time Again\\", which sounds like bad Boston, or \\"Wildest Dreams\\", which sounds like bad Rush?<br />I'd have to conclude that Asia is worth pulling out for the occasional listen, but I can't say I've rediscovered a forgotten classic by any means.  It is a generally enjoyable piece of 80s pop rock and I guess there's something to be said for that.  Certainly a reasonable choice if you have a hankering for guitar-and-synth rock and feel reasonably confident you can get it home without suffering a beat-down at the hands of an overeager cop.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever.  First of all the actors did such a good job with relations to the characters.  The effects in the movie were unbeleivable.  But i do recomend that you read the books first because it might be hard to understand if you dont.  The movie follows the story well in some places but in other places it didn't.  But i'm not complaining.  Some people are to hard to please and if it doesn't follow the book exactly they think it ruins the movie.  No offense to the people who think that but it WOULD be kind of hard to fit everything in the movie that is in the book.  I have read the entire series 15 times simultaneously, so dont think that i dont know the book.  So my advice to everyone is... if you havent read the book, read it, and if you havent seen the movie see it!!!!
B00008DDXC|4.0|It's good to know that some companies do in fact listen to customer feedback. The Harry Potter DVD set is a great improvement over its predecessor as far as feature access goes.<br />The film itself is rather well done. While it's no replacement for reading the book, it's still a lot of fun. There are some corny lines, and a groan-inducing film cliche at the end, but these details fail to tarnish the experience. There are a lot more scary moments than the first film, but most children over 5 won't really mind. <br />Now for the features. Thankfully, you no longer have to wade through the same silly puzzle every time you want to see the deleted scenes. In this DVD, they're just in a simple menu you can get to from the starting screen. In fact, it's the first thing highlighted once you start the disc up. The scenes themselves are mostly extensions of existing ones, and it'd have been a lot better to have the option of integrating them back into the film.<br />The rest of the features range from good, to mediocre, to &quot;oh, this one was meant for kids...&quot;. The interview with J. K. Rowling and the scriptwriter is pretty informative, but the interviewer asks some pretty silly and obvious questions. The cast interviews are entertaining. The children have very childlike responses, and the adults are more insightful. The tours of the sets are very enjoyable and quite relaxed. You get to see all sorts of places not fully revealed in the films such as inside shops of Diagon Alley. There's a concept design gallery with some fantastic pieces of art. The rest is for the kids. A simple quiz on the movie, some games and little bits of fun like a customizable photo slideshow. Same goes for the DVD features. Kids will have fun with the toys and games and the voice activation.<br />Overall, this is a great movie with a great DVD. Obviously, if you're a Harry Potter fan, you have this set already, but if you have a passing interest in the series and are doubtful on getting theDVD, you should give it a rent.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Chicago is the most upbeat, amazing spectecular movie of 2002.  I mean it has been in theatres since December it obviously did somthing right.<BR>    All three main actors give remarkable strong performances.  Renee Zellweger as the ditzy, not so smart dreamer does excellent in her role as Roxie Hart.  Catherine Zeta Jones does just as good as the gaudy, singer, dancer, and murderer Velma Kelly.  And also Richard Gere as the showy professional lawyer Billy Flynn.  Included in the Cast is Queen Latifa as the big mama, and also Tay Diggs as the band leader.  All along with a hundred dancing singing extras who have a role of there own.<BR>    The Music is the best! You will constanlty be singing one of the 14 major songs included in the film.  All the music is ubeat and fast, except for a few which are a bit depressing.  Along with the music the dancing is unbeliable!!  The whole cast dances in there own little way it is amazing.<BR>    If your looking for an ubeat, jazzy, cynical, musical CHICAGO is for you.  If you don't wann go to the theatre and see it then wait till August 19, 2003 for that is when it will be avaivalbe on DVD and Video.  Hey, I already have a copy ordered and can't wait till it comes out.  I've already seen it 3 times in theatres.  CHICAGO is the best!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Let's face it - we all want another Rumours, and this isn't it. While there are some really good songs on here, \\"Say You Will\\" is an album that sounds like a mish-mash of solo work by Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. Songs like the Wallflowers-ish \\"Peacekeeper\\" (sleepwalker?)and the electro-pop \\"Red Rover\\" are (very) unfortunately reminiscent of Buckinghams bizarre and critically panned 80's solo work on albums like the dreadful \\"Go Insane.\\" It would not be entirely unrealistic to think that Buckingham couldn't garner enough label interest for a solo project, so he decided to use his songs on this album under the Fleetwood Mac banner. Fortunately, this album has some familiar, though hardly classic moments such as \\"say you will\\", \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Silver Girl\\", and Buckingham even vindicates himself near the end of the record, with the catchy, irish-folk melody \\"steal your heart away.\\" This is a worthwile album, though it will do more to remind the world of Fleetwod Mac's wonderful 70's records than it will to supplant them.

6305827079|5.0|Fantastic, Super, Dazzling. This 90 minutes of concert and behind the scenic footage is breath taking. It is 1970 and Elvis has a Vegas tour planned, he has finished his movie contract and has been reborn more mature, thanks to his 68 comeback. `That's the way it is' captures Elvis' charisma, talent and amazing voice, it is totally re-cut and restored by Rick Schmidlin (Greed, Touch of Evil). It is basically split into two parts - off and on stage. The off stage section follows Elvis in the MGM studios and his endearing clowning around through the Vegas warm up and the show itself. And what a show! It shows Elvis at the height of his carer holding the audience spellbound. There is a variety of songs (full list of songs below) incorporating R & B, Blues, Country and of course Rock & Roll. There are touching and spin tingling versions of You've lost that loving feeling and You don't have to say you love me. But naturally all the songs are outstanding. In conclusion I think even if Elvis hadn't had any of his movies, no previous concerts and no fame what so ever, just this - he would still be the King. <br />The full song list - <BR>      <BR>That's all right<BR>Little sister/Get back<BR>My baby left me<BR>Crying time<BR>Love me<BR>Twenty days and twenty nights<BR>Bridge over troubled water<BR>Cattle call<BR>Chime bells<BR>Santa Claus is back in town<BR>Mary in the morning<br />Mystery train/Tiger Man<BR>That's all right <BR>I got a woman<BR>Hound dog<BR>Heartbreak hotel<BR>Love me tender<BR>I can't stop loving you<br />Just pretend<BR>The wonder of you<BR>In the ghetto<BR>Patch it up<BR>You've lost that loving feeling<BR>Polk salad Annie<BR>One night<BR>Don't be cruel<BR>Blue suede shoes<BR>All shook up<BR>You don't have to say you love<BR>Suspicious Minds<BR>Can't help falling in love

B00005JKLZ|2.0|I rented this movie thinking it was going to be enjoyable, boy was I wrong.  The special effects were cool, but the story went nowhere.  I usually can follow plots and storylines, even the really complex ones, but this one was beyond me.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I highly encourage you not to buy, rent or see this movie.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Overlooking the entire media frenzy over the first video, this cd is very imaginative and expressive. Points to Madonna for experimenting without apology. Great acoustics. I will give a run down of each song now:<br />1. American Life: The song is good, but lowers to solemnly average after the extraneous \\"rap.\\" B-<BR>2. Hollywood: Draws an accurate picture of people's fascination with Hollywood and their over expectations of the stardom and glamour. B<BR>3. I'm So Stupid: The lyrics are a bit elementary, but the beat saves it. B<BR>4. Love Profusion: Fantastic song. The acoustics bring it to the forefront. A+<BR>5. Nobody Knows Me: This one is a moving song. I dig it. A<BR>6.. Nothing Fails: A mushy song for Guy Ritchie. The choir in the end makes this track stand out. A-<BR>7. Intervention: Mid-tempo masterpiece. A+<BR>8. X-Static Process: Just Madonna and the acoustic guitar. Bare and beautiful. B+<BR>9. Mother and Father: Juvenile lyrics and voice, but nice beat and rhythm. B+<BR>10. Die Another Day: Nice dance song, I guess. It isn't as striking without the video. B<BR>11. Easy Ride: It grows on you. B<br />Hopefully, this was helpful in some way...

In fact, I don't know why I'm even reviewing this album, everyone knows illmatic is a classic. If your a new rap listener this is probably a good place to start, yea its 10 songs but its 10 songs of f*ckin genius lyrics. Nas is defintely on the top 10 or probably top 5 best rappers of all time, no doubt, QB's finest. If you don't have this then stop thinking about it and buy it, it's worth every penny trust me.

I am a huge fan of John Carpenters movies, The Fog, Escape From New York, The Thing, etc. but this movie tops it all because of its low budgetness which makes it really scary, if you are a fan of horror movies this is a must have.
B00008OLYN|5.0|The beauty of Opeth lies in the band's ability to conquer many different styles of music.  This album, while it lacks the variety of their older releases, maintains a constant flow of mellow songs that prove to listeners that Opeth can master these as well as they can master the heavier material.  The first track, \\"Windowpane,\\" is the best (in my humble opinion) and is one of my favorite Opeth songs to date.  \\"To Rid The Disease\\" is another good song.  In all honesty, they're all good songs, but those two stand out to me.  If you're looking for anything heavy, then this is not the album for you, as the vocals are all clean and the heaviest parts are about as heavy as what you'd find on a Genesis album.  But if you need a nice long break from the maelstrom of metal, then this album is definitely for you.  Nothing extreme, but nevertheless, Damnation is pure musical mastery.
B0000013GT|5.0|The best Outkast album to date, it has everything hip hop is and should be. The lyrics are dope and the beats are outstanding. From beginning to end Outkast shows that hip hop is truely going to progress in the future and that hip hop has so much to offer. With songs like &quot;Growing Old&quot; and &quot;Millenium&quot; Outkast takes music to a whole new level,the hooks on every song stick in your head and feed the mind.Its a music experience you will not regret so cop this album and become ATLiens.
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a must hear albumn. I could not find a bad track on the whole CD. While some of the songs have dark, brooding lyrics, they are far from the typical metal band fare. The voice of the lead singer conveys a depth and passion that gives this albumn the a very special quaility. Buy it, loop it, love it.
B000063COX|5.0|New to Metal? buy this now!<BR>Get on board the genesis of modern metal. Led Zep and Sabbath had mapped the course in immortal albums. Maiden (specially primary creative force Harris) seemed to take notice and wedded fresh epic themed heavy blues/rocker structures to the spawning new-wave-speed-punk scene that kept mutating at the time. Bassist Steve Harris guides this band thru material that would ignite a variety of fans at this time. Iron Maiden are directly responsible for the epic metal we've heard for the last 20 years.<BR>Maiden have managed to bridge the gap between the Metal somber bangers worldview to the prog rocker cosmos of ever twisting themes meant to showcase the imagination of the band. Instanly accessable, catchy, addictive. This album beats the...out of the new \\"nu-Metal\\" and fake punk trend we've had to endure for the last few years! Every song is great!
6305696071|2.0|By now if you know nothing about movies, you at least know that &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; is the film that made Julia Roberts a super star.  She plays Vivien, a Hollywood hooker who lands it in the big leagues when financier, Edward Lewis (Richard Gere)pays her to be seen with him for one week.  Of course, they fall in love.  The Cinderella story proved irresistable to audiences in the 90's, making the movie a sleeper hit that continues to be regarded as great cinema even though, at best, its diversionary fluff with a kick.<BR>Unfortunately, there's nothing pretty about this tired transfer.  Colors, although occasionally well balanced, often exhibit a pinkish characteristic and at times are way too brightly realized.  Contrast levels are generally lower than one would expect. Chips and scratches in the original negative are present and noticable throughout. Edge enhancement is detected and bothersome.  Pixelization occasionally makes an unwelcomed inclusion into the bargain basement transfer quality.  The 1:85:1 widescreen picture is not even anamorphically enhanced - WHY?!? After previously issuing this movie on a director's cut DVD, with the same deplorable image quality, we get a 10th anniversary edition reissue that adds nothing new, save a mini-featurette and theatrical trailer to the mix.  The audio, 5.1 remastered, sounds adequate enough though it is dated.  <BR>BOTTOM LINE: We need another version of this movie.  Given that Disney Inc. is suddenly into doing Vista Series reissues of its catalogue titles I suspect that this perennial fav' is high on their &quot;to-do&quot; list of pending DVD remasters.

B00005JCAA|4.0|\\"Meet Joe Black\\" is a film of contradictions.  After starting out with a genuinely thought-provoking premise (what would happen if death took a human form and came to earth to learn about life from his next victim) the plot comes to a grinding halt when Death - in the embodiment of Brad Pitt - falls for his victim's daughter.  Anthony Hopkins is Bill Perish, Death's next intended victim and, as usual, gives us a performance of quiet, poignant introspection that is masterfully crafted and beautiful to behold.  <BR>After some laborious inner conflict and some totally extemporanious scenes that have nothing to do with the central plot, \\"Meet Joe Black\\" concludes with a knock out birthday celebration sequence that has such an emotional swell built into it, I found myself getting weepy before the final fade out. <BR>This is the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" of a DVD already made available, which really translates to the fact that all Universal Studios has done is to slap the same transfer into some snazzy new packaging while adding some real throw away extras on a second disc that one could easily live without if one already owns the first DVD incarnation.<BR>Image quality on this DVD is the same as the previously released DVD.  At times the picture is quite solid, with excellent color fidelity, shadow and contrast delineation and solid black levels.  Unfortunately, quite often the picture gets bogged down with pixelization that really breaks apart background detail.  There's also some minor edge enhancement and some slight shimmering of background and fine detail.  Contrast levels can, in a few instances, be too low.  The audio is 5.1 and well balanced, with explosive bass levels that will really give your rear speakers a work out.<BR>The big, big, BIG extra that Universal throws us on disc two is \\"Death Takes A Holiday\\" a Paramount flick with Frederick March playing Death, come down to earth to study mankind before claiming one for his own.  It's a dated movie with overly theatrical performances and a generally middle-of-the-road budget that really makes the whole thing pretty tacky.  As for the quality of the transfer, the gray scale is adequately balanced but with chips and scratches on the original negative.  Contrast levels are often too low.  The audio is mono and strident.<BR>BOTTOM LINE: If you don't already own this movie, I'd recommend it.  Just keep in mind that it's a two hour premise stretched to a three hour running time.  However, if you already own the previously issued DVD - this copy is not worth a repurchase!
B00006CXSS|5.0|If you buy this set be ready to plant yourself in front of your TV for days on end. If you start to watch it you won't be able to stop. It is so captivating you'll want to watch the entire series one episode after another, over and over again.
0385504209|3.0|I had a lot of fun reading this book -- but reviews to the contrary, it's not erudite.<br />Brown makes many gaffes.  He believes, for example, that the golden ratio, or phi (a number which fascinated Greek philosophers and mathematicians because it was the first known instance of an irrational number -- the existence of which contradicted all their theories of the orderly and explainable foundations of the world), was \\"derived\\" from the Fibonacci series.  He also seems to think that a codex is a scroll.  (A codex is, of course, a manuscript volume, or book.  Think of the early illuminated gospels.)<br />There are many similar confusions, but it would be churlish to list them because that's not the point.  No one buys this kind of book to understand math or learn art history, they buy it because it's a blast.  Two-thousand year-old onspiracies, religion, romance, betrayal (though anyone who is suprised by the identity of the betrayer should probably go back to reading Dick and Jane), mixed with sketchy, pseudo-exotic European locations, and leavened with a dash of stock characters.  The prose is servicable, mostly -- a few grammatical horrors don't get in the way of being able to visualize the action -- and the plot gallops along.  A pure pedigree bestseller.
0141301155|5.0|What kid wouldn't love to tour a chocolate factory that no one had visited for several years?  What kid wouldn't want access to secrets held by the greatest candy maker ever?<br />What kid wouldn't want to embark on a wild adventure and meet the amazing, Willy Wonka?<br />I can't think of one who wouldn't! :-)<br />I know I would love to do all of those things and I'm not even a kid anymore...  well, I guess I'm a kid at heart.<br />Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is an amazing book.  I was  first exposed to this story by my 3rd grade teacher, as a whole class read aloud.  And from that day forward, I was a lover of the writings of Roald Dahl.<br />I have since read this story every year of my teaching career to my own classes.  And I can honestly say that I have not found a class yet that has not loved the story of Charlie's amazing adventure!  This is one of the greatest books ever written for children... and I really mean that!<br />Roald Dahl introduces us to the Bucket family, an unfortunate family who struggles to survive on the money Mr. Bucket makes as a toothpaste cap screwer.<br />One day Mr. Bucket is laid off from his job and the family begins to starve.  One member of the family, little Charlie, struggles to subsist on bread and cabbage soup.  Poor Charlie finds himself starving to death, when one day he finds a dollar in the snow and his whole life changes.  With this dollar Charlie buys a candy bar just to fill his stomach and gets so much more than he could ever imagine.<br />Charlie becomes the 5th child to find a golden ticket and with it, has the marvelous opportunity to visit Mr. Wonka's chocolate factory.<br />At the factory Charlie meets up with a most wild assortment of characters:<br />* Augustus Gloop:  A large boy who loves to eat more than anything in the world.  His uncontrollable appetite leads him to a sticky end.<br />*  Veruca Salt:  A spolied rotten young lady. Who is prone to terrible tantrums when she can't get what she wants.  Her greed leads her to a messy exit.<br />*  Violet Beauregard:  An incessant gum chewer who chomps and chomps her jaws day in and day out.  Her insatiable desire for gum leads to her chewy end.<br />*  Mike Teevee:  A crazy Television addict, whose love for TV sends him zipping through the stratosphere.<br />*  The Oompa Loompas:  A group of melodic factory workers who work for Mr. Wonka, and act as a chorus in a greek tragedy.  Their silly songs are one of the many highlights of this book.<br />*  Mr. Willy Wonka:  The enegmatic ruler of a chocolate universe.  He has more secrets and surprises than we could ever hope for.<br />I highly reccommend this book for kids from 0 to 99!  It is a nice read aloud for younger children, at an appropriate independent reading level for 3rd through 5th graders and can easily hold the attention of an adult.  Read this wonderful book you will not be disappointed!ds her to a messy exit.<br />*  Violet Beauregard:  An incessant gum chewer who chomps and chomps her jaws day in and day out.

B000060P79|4.0|I don't care what the recent reviews have said about simple plan. I thing they have great music. Mostly everyone who has reviewed has said this album is 4 star and i agree. I don't care if its not hard core punk rock. Its still fresh punk with a hint of greenday somewhere. Can't wait till the next Album
B00005OAIE|3.0|The first half of this CD, played twice, would be better than the whole album once through. It fizzles in the 2nd half, with several tunes that just are not memorable. But it does start out great. Mr. Mayer is obviously talented, but his voice is kind of monotone. So after a while, you've heard enough of it. So press STOP about half way through, or three-quarters, &amp; then put on something else. And then you'll really enjoy this Room for Squares. As for the follow-up Live album, with many of the same tunes: Stick with this studio version.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austen wrote PERSUASION towards the end of her life, while in her final illness. Thus an atmosphere of bending weariness and quiet resignation pervades this tender romance, infused within provincial life in Regency England, swaying against the backdrop of the Napoleonic wars. I could not help but love this BBC film version unconditionally, so deftly are the gentle qualities of the novel brought forth.<br />As with her earlier novel, MANSFIELD PARK, Austen filled this story with subdued satire - intertwining a comedy of genteel manners with the unassailable decrees of the human heart. This is the story of Anne Elliot (Amanda Root): a single woman in her late 20's who, eight years previous, on the counsel of her patroness and late mother's friend, Lady Russell (Susan Fleetwood-who sadly died of cancer shortly after this film was made), had refused an offer of marriage from her true love, Captain Frederick Wentworth (Ciaran Hinds) on the grounds of his poor financial prospects.<br />Captain Wentworth returns to Anne's rather confined realm of society when his sister, Mrs. Croft, and her husband, an Admiral in the Navy (John Woodvine, of 1992's WUTHERING HEIGHTS) lease Anne's baronet father's estate, Kellynch Hall. Before she can join her father and elder sister Elizabeth (Phoebe Nicholls) in Bath, she must first spend a few weeks with her hypochondriac younger sister Mary, whose husband Charles' family, the Musgroves - parents Mr. and Mrs. Musgrove, and two younger sisters, Henrietta and Louisa - reside nearby. It is here that Anne becomes re-acquainted with her long-lost love, who's by now an advantageous match for any young woman, having made his prize fortune during the war. Wentworth initially fancies himself \\"a lost man\\" to the first attractive young lady who bestows upon him her \\"compliments to the Navy.\\" To all appearances, Louisa Musgrove is that very lady...<br />Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, even though they lack the physical beauty distinctive in other Austen adaptations, express the gamut of suppressed emotions most flawlessly here. Ms. Root conjures all the feelings of empathy and affection with every delicate expression she makes. Mr. Hinds, whom I've seen in a number of other roles -including that of an overwrought Mr. Rochester in a 1997 adaptation of JANE EYRE - gives here what's quite likely the best performance of his career. His Wentworth's subtle yet barely suppressed anger hits Anne like a bombshell. The emotion is slow paced and very flowing - but it's nonetheless quite palpable.<br />The entire cast, in fact, gives every cause for high praise -- most notably Corin Redgrave (brother of Lynn and Vanessa) as Anne's vain and spendthrift father, Sir Walter Elliot, Sophie Thompson (sister of Emma Thompson) as Anne's self-centered younger sister Mary Musgrove, and Fiona Shaw (Mrs. Reed in 1996's JANE EYRE) as the indomitable Mrs. Croft - each are absolutely perfect in their respective roles.<br /><br />Many a time, upon a weekend afternoon, I've placed this tape into my VCR and played it while occupied with various household chores. As ever and as always, this film offers up its many beauties, and they never fail to enchant me: the long walks through the pristine and stately New Forest - the excursions with the Navel men striding proudly along jetties of the shores at Lyme - the atmospheric turns about the drizzly sidewalks, the pump rooms, and the concert halls of Bath.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This series has changed me.  I never had the opportunity to watch the first run of the series on HBO, as it was a bit too \\"real\\" for my family.  My mother's uncle was a fighter pilot who was shot down over Poland (after splashing no less than 4 German planes), and I suppose it brought back too many hard memories.  I bought this DVD set and thoroughly enjoyed each of the 10 episodes.  Right now, I'm reading the book upon which this movie was based, which I also highly recommend.  It's much easier to put a \\"face\\" to the characters after seeing the series and having it fresh in your mind.<br />What really makes it special is that these things actually happened, and the survivors of Easy Company comment on the events as a prelude to each episode.  In a very cool move, the names of these suvivors are not revealed until the documentary on Disc 6.  As a result, you don't know who will survive until the end.  This is one item where the special features (especially the documentary) are every bit as important as the film itself; perhaps even more so.<br />If you enjoy war movies, buy this.  It will keep you entertained for 10 straight hours.  I plan on watching it again after I'm done with the book.  This film captures the comraderie of army life in WWII, as well as the low points and high points.  These guys were more than members in the same unit.  They were, in most cases, comrades and brothers, and it shows.  This film is not for the faint of heart, however.  While not quite as blatantly gory as Saving Private Ryan, I assure you blood does flow in this film.  It pulls no punches, but doesn't overdo it.<br />Not only the story is good; the cinematography is breathtaking.  A truly exceptional story and a tribute to those men who died defending the world from Nazi domination.  Awesome.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life is one of Madonna's most personal and best albums. Here's what I think of all the songs.<BR>1. American Life = This song had to grow on me, but now I love it. I think she does a pretty decent job on the rapping.<BR>2. Hollywood = Another excellent pop song that's about how people can be misled into thinking that being a celebrity is the greatest thing in the world.<BR>3. I'm So Stupid = I really love this one. It's kinda about how some of her views on her life and fame have changed.<BR>4. Love Profustion = I love all the songs on this album, but if someone made me choose a least favorite, I might pick this one. It's still very pretty. And Mirwais's backup vocals sound very nice.<BR>5. Nobody Knows Me = This one's great too. It's about not letting the opinion of the critics and haters bring her down.<BR>6. Nothing Fails = Best song on the album. It's a love ballad most likely about her husband Guy. The choir is good too.<BR>7. Intervention = This is a nice pretty song, that I think is about her son.<BR>8. X-Static Process = This one's really amazing. She does some of her best vocals ever on this track. Love the parts where she's singing with herself.<BR>9. Mother And Father = Very personal song about her parents. And I love how she takes this really serious subject (about still trying to get over her mother's death), but instead of having a slow ballad, she turns it into a great dance track. It sounds kinda sexy too.<BR>10. Die Another Day = Another song that's great to dance too. This may be the least personal song, as it was written for the James Bond movie of the same name. But then again, it could be about herself too.<BR>11. Easy Ride = Great mid-tempo about wanting her life to be good, but not getting there with an 'easy ride'. I love how symphony plays with the electronic music. <BR>This of course, is probably gonna be one of those love or hate albums, and I'm a person that definitely loves it. Madonna really bared her soul on this album and wasreally honest about things in her life. Along with Ray Of Light and Like A Prayer, this album is truly one of the 3 best.
0684800713|2.0|When S.A.R. first came out in the 1920's, a review of the day said that Hemmingway's prose,\\"...put conventional English to shame.\\"  Well, that was then, this is now.  The more I read it the more I wanted it to end.  Is it entirely possible that in the American myths about Papa's alcohol soaked hunting and fishing trips, we've elevated the work because we wanted to like it as we seem to like the man?  Hemmigway is the perinneal 'Uncle That We All Wanted', but a much better and true account of the Lost Generation authors in Paris is A Moveable Feast, please read it before reading 'Sun...'.

I was starved for Chester Bennington's hypnotic voice...and he delivered. I never thought it would be possible to outdo \\"Hybrid Theory\\", but they did. Not only is \\"Meteora\\" a clear show of the bands ever growing musical maturity, it also is a testament to the bands musical staying power as it takes chances with new sounds. I'm in love with Linkin Park all over again!...
B00006JJ1O|5.0|I first heard of T.A.T.U on MTV's 'You Hear It First' segment. Ever since then I have been hooked on T.A.T.U.! When they finally released '200 KM/H...' I expected alot and I wasn't let down! The album is pure gold and has alot of great songs. Here they are:<br />1.Not Gonna Get Us - Woa! Great dance song and Vocals! (9.5/10)<br />2.All The Things She Said - First single and probably the best Pop song in Years! (10/10)<br />3.Show Me Love - At first I didn't like this song but it grew on me! (9/10)<br />4.30 Minutes - A decent song but probably the worst on the album. (7/10)<br />5.How Soon Is Now? - One of the best, the harmonies are great. (10/10)<br />6.Clowns - Pure dance hit! A great song! (9.5/10)<br />7.Malchik Gay - My favorite song on the album. Grea melodies and great lyrics. (10/10)<br />8.Stars - Woa! I have never heard a song like this. English melodies with Russian rap. Pure Genius! (10/10)<br />9.Ya Shosla S Uma - Russian Version of \\"All The Things She Said\\". I like the Russinan version better myself. (10/10)<br />10.Nas Ne Dagoniat - Russian Version of \\"Not Gonna Get Us\\" Sounds just as good as the English Version! (9.5/10)<br />Overall = 9.5<br />Great Album....A Must Have!
B000089RVX|5.0|What can I say? I absolutely love this CD. It's a rather moody CD, and Amy's voice is beautiful, and combined with her's and Ben's lyrics you've got a fantastic peice of work.  <br />The songs: <br />Going Under - catchy, fast paced, nice opening to the CD 3/5<br />Bring Me To Life - cool music, liked the lyrics, one of my favs 5/5<br />Everybody's Fool - very nice lyrics, fit very well 4/5<br />My Immortal - one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. Love the piano music and lyrics. Easily my favorite song on the CD. 7/5<br />Haunted - one of the most dark songs on the CD, very nice 5/5<br />Tourniquet - I had to listen to this one a few times before I liked it, but it's cool. Very dark, though. About suicide. 4/5<br />Imaginary - wow, another one of my favorites. The lyrics rock! 5/5 <br />Taking Over Me - eh, it's ok. Not as good as some of the others, though. 2/5 <br />Hello - another one of the more dark ones. For example: Has no one told you she's not breathing?/Hello, I am your mind/giving you someone to talk to/hello. I love this one, too. 5/5<br />My Last Breath - fast-paced and very sad. Another one of my favorites. 5/5<br />Whisper - once again, an ok one. It's very long and gets repitive after a while. 2/5 <br />All in all, this is an excellent CD. You will not regret buying it!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack does it again with their third effort, keeping in tune with their previous albums Faceless begins with hard heavy music and Sully's incredible vocals that begs to play as loud as your stereo can go with Straight Out of Line, and ending the album with the tribal sound of Serenity.  Their self-titled debut album ending with Voodoo, and their second with Spiral, the bands creativity and orgionality with these tribal tunes never gets old.  Like any great ride should Faceless begins with a harsh smack in the face with great solid hard rock, and takes you down slowly to keep from snapping your neck from the whiplash.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Yes, there are times LB gets a bit carried away with experimentation, but with repeated listenings, it makes sense :) And yes, there are a lot of songs here; maybe a few could have been \\"B\\" sides...<br />But overall, this is CLASSIC FM! It's like they never left. And, unlike other reviewers, I really don't miss CM too much. I always thought her material a bit bland. Many songs are absolutely amazing, and stand right up there with the greatest FM songs.<br />Bottom line, this is a very pleasant surprise, full of edgy, great music, and is FM through and through. Way to go!

B00005JLSE|5.0|Truth be told, I honestly thought Chicago was much better than Moulin Rouge but then again that's my personal opinion. I thought the latter was a little all over the place musically. <br />I've watched tons of stage musicals as well as those translated onto the big screen & this version of Chicago ranks as one of the best I've seen, both stage & screen.<br />The feel to the entire movie was one of genuine fun & the musical tunes were better than the originals performed by previous performers I thought.<br />Didn't think Queen Latifah nor John C Reilly were particularly outstanding (hence my surprise at their Oscar nominations, one of which should have gone to Richard Gere instead) but still held the film together with their decent supporting performances. The 3 main cast members were very good given that I didn't initially expect much from them from a musical standpoint (til I found out about their musical/dance backgrounds - yes even Gere sang before). <br />Overall a very entertaining film. Well worth watching & listening to a good few more times.
0790734850|4.0|What Ellroy does best is capture the profane, racist, woman hating ...world of the 1950's and now, the 60's. Anyone who revealed the truths of today as effectively would be....well...toast. James, wisely, sticks to history.  While there is a healthy (and richly deserved) audience for Ellroy's books, there is, apparently, no audience for Ellroy on film. (Or no one willing to try.) What we get instead is Ellroy lite. The characters Ellroy so colourfully portrays are simply lost, shorn of the very nasty, candidly expressed views and values that make the book such a revelation. If you haven't read Ellroy you might not notice, but if you have, you're gonna be thinkin \\"Freakin Disney!\\" (Notice: No Ellroy dialog used here. It would simply not be allowed.) <BR>PS: Is there an ongoing discussion of the possible accuracy of the events in \\"American Tabloid\\" going on anywhere on the Net? ...

B00008S2VH|4.0|After reading the flurry of negative reviews in the mainstream press, I was more than a little nervous about Madonna's new album.  \\"Could it really [be bad]?,\\" I thought.  Now that I have my own copy, happiliy I can say NO!  I love the production that Mirwais Ahmadzai has brought to Madonna's sound and also enjoy the fact that this time around, they are not playing hide-and-seek with her voice...her vocals are right up front.  Also, I must stress that listeners mustn't be put off by the American Life single; IMHO, it's not the strongest choice for a single but serves as a good introduction to all that is to come.  Only the lack of a full-on dancefloor stormer keeps me from awarding 5 stars...
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Fleetwood Mac's Say You Will, their first studio album since the 1995 clunker Time represents the first time that Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham have played major roles in a Fleetwood Mac studio album since 1987's Tango In The Night. Meanwhile, it is also the first album since 1970's Kiln House in which longtime singer-songwriter and keyboard player Christine McVie didn't play a significant role. She does background vocals on one track on this album, but has retired from the music business. <br />Without McVie's radio friendly tunes, it was left up to the usually esoteric Buckingham and the often flaky Nicks to carve an album that could be commercially viable. Nicks seemed to rise to that challenge more effectively with songs like the title track and &quot;Thrown Down,&quot; while Buckingham seemed to sacrifice commercial possibilities for attempts at experimenting, like &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave.&quot; <br />Brimming over with 18 tracks, the album almost sounds like a hodgepodge of solo work for each artist, with many of Buckingham's songs coming from recording sessions from his now-aborted fourth solo album Gift of Screws. One unfortunate decision on the band's part was that &quot;Bleed To Love Her&quot; was included among Buckingham's nine songs, not for song quality, but because a live version was included on 1997's The Dance, the 5 million-selling reunion album. <br />That doesn't mean that Buckingham's contributions were failures. &quot;What's The World Coming To&quot; may be guilty of being excessive social commentary, but the song is very catchy. The band's first single, Buckingham's &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; is also a catchy number. If the near six minute &quot;Come&quot; were shortened, it would also stand out among Buckingham's songs. <br />Even with the less than stellar songwriting from Buckingham, two things shouldn't be disputed when talking about his work. He is a master with the guitar and he is a great producer, particularly for Nicks. <br />As for Nicks, while her bandmates were on hiatus, she released a boxed set and a studio album and toured for both. While some of Nicks's work came from songs that didn't quite make Trouble in Shangri-la, her critically acclaimed 2001 solo record, other songs (like the Sept. 11 musing &quot;Illume&quot;) are new for this album. Three songs, &quot;Smile At You,&quot; &quot;Running Through The Garden,&quot; and &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; were written years ago but were never released on a Fleetwood Mac record or on a solo album. <br />While Nicks's songs on the album are generally stronger, one glaring exception was the song she wrote about Sheryl Crow, &quot;Silver Girl,&quot; with lyrics that seemed to suggest that her best days as a songwriter passed her by. However, Nicks more than redeemed herself with &quot;Destiny Rules,&quot; with strong lyrics and Buckingham's masterful guitar playing. <br />Fans of Nicks's passionate stage performances of the past (and who can't forget her spellbinding live versions of &quot;Rhiannon&quot; from the early days?) have often lamented that Nicks has lately chosen to play it safe vocally. She is sometimes guilty of this on this album, both in the title track and in &quot;Destiny Rules,&quot; but &quot;Everybody Finds Out,&quot; another album standout, showcases some of the most fiery vocals found on any Nicks record. <br />Overall, this is one of the better Fleetwood Mac albums, although four songs should have been cut and one should have been shortened. It still has more than enough material on it to merit buying.
0800141660|4.0|Much have been said about the worth of this movie and I agree with almost all of them. I only have this to add: Hugh Grant did surprise me, it never occurred to me that he could be such a good actor. Emma Thompson is pleasant, mature and adorable as always. But having seen too many of her movies, it is not easy to focus on her part here alone. Allan and especially Kate was such a hugh success.<br />Possibly one of the best Sense and sensibility we have, not only for this generation and for many generations to come.
B000004286|5.0|So many great scores have come before this, providing films with the perfect accompaniment. But some are both perfect for the movie, as well as independently as music. This score, beautifully composed by the brilliant James Horner, enchants and relaxes us. The flow of the music is so smooth that one you have listened to the whole score, it seems too flawless to be real. I love this movie, and the score is too sensual to ignore. It is the very root of what makes this a great world in which to live.

0140177396|5.0|Of mice and man by John Steinbeck was published in 1939. The story takes place in the salinas valley, california , during the Great Depression. The drought inthe Great Plain forces them move to the west.The people who move to the west are called migrant workers.Our characters, Lennie and George, are migrant workers too. They are the only people who work together that make them not become lonely because they have each other to look after. Lennie is a huge man with a weak mind and Gerge is  small with strong thoughts. Both are totally different people. Lennie always cause problems that let George get in trouble.Lennie doesn't know how to control his power that made him kill many mice,than the pup.The troubles are getting larger and larger. who will he kill next?<BR>              <BR>I give this book five stars because it is a very good book for me to learn English. I learned many vocabulary words but most important thing I learned i sabout friendship. Friends need to help eachother and they both did. Friendship are not easy to maintain in a good status.
B00002E224|4.0|All happened within a day, a modern Ulysses?<br />There were de facto only two characters in this film, two youngsters who chanced to meet in Vienna and then they talked and talked, talking about life, about their parents' expectations and their reciprocal resentment,  about friends and human relationships... about everything. <br />What the director did was keep changing scenes, taking the audience on a beautiful tour in the whole town of Vienna interweaving each setting with a new local passerby or else a fortune-teller to make it look real. He did it, the viewers don't feel bored ( such a contrast to \\"Anne Frank\\" ). Needless to say, they are not intended for the children unless they sufficiently know about the ironies and humours of modern life. <br />Recommended.
B00008DDSC|2.0|It was one of the worst movies if not the worst,I've ever seen.Boredom and perversy at the uttermost level.It's not to say that &quot;Spader&quot; and &quot;Gyllenhaal&quot; are unimpressive.Indeed,they  both perform excellent acting and they would be extolled if they've starred in somethink better.But purchasing and watching this movie is simply waste of time and money.I rue the day I bought it.
6305878323|4.0|This is a comical satire on utilitarian precision and propriety : the children rather need more playtime  and more imagination. In short,  they need everything Mary Poppins, the young and charmingly loving witch brought to Bank's children. <br />The film was shot just a few years before The Sound of Music. The rhythm of this film is quite slow and it's more like a play without much settings/background and, it's long. From the today's children's point of view, the scene about bank management board or even the bird-feeding woman may not be very inviting.<br />Having said that, this is still a marvelous movie. Children would like the one man band played by the chimney sweeper. Mary Poppins part was wonderful. Even Mr Bank and his so-called woman-liberalizing wife and or the captain next door are all such a big humour. Yes, there is also the tongue twister...  Now that Harry Potter, The Worst Witch are so popular, winds are certainly blowing Mary Poppins' way too. I rank this next to The Sound of Music.
B000003S0D|5.0|Maybe its different when you know a record for 30 years or just get to know such an old record. I had lost track with the first four King Crimson LPs for almost 20 years and only recently re-discovered them. They are my favorite King Crimson albums and the way I see it, one long suite consisting of 4 albums. Lizard used to be my favorite of these 4. Even after 30+ years, the music and the whole concept still sound not only fresh but daring - often surreal. I especially love the first three and the last two songs. There are so many details in here. Theres Rock, theres Jazz, theres concert music, all amalgamated into something new - something even King Crimson ceased to do after Island - what more would one want? I hope the new listener can enjoy this LP the way I do, for I do realize theres also nostalgia involved in my judgment; yet the quality is still there, the LP has matured wonderfully. There is a remastered CD out which brings all the details of the music to your ears. Lizard is a thoroughly satisfying record.
B00005JLRT|5.0|I laugh at some of the people who critique a sci-fi movie like this. They obviously shouldn't go see these kinds of movies because they will be dissappointed every time. I loved this movie as it had a good plot, was funny, and had a great climatic battle at the end. These movies are for enjoyment of the imagination, nothing more. Some people need to get a more broad imagination when it comes to sci-fi movies. I'll buy this on DVD when it comes out.
B000051VWW|5.0|Sade is an amazing artist and has a wonderful voice. Her voice is like silk over the beats and sets a mood of peace and harmony. I am a big fan of hers and she is one of the few soul artists i listen to. AMAZING!... You can tell a lot of hard work was put into this album, beats and everything is on-point.
0316666343|5.0|This book takes you places you never knew existed! This is a fairly easy read (read it in 1 day) but it sticks in your head days following... I was pleasantly suprised to see the writer take on so many different tones and explicit beings... you feel with the character.. you become her! I loved this book and i hope to buy it and make it part of my personal library... The emotions you go through while reading this book are unforgettable- obviously I recommend it to everyone!

His writing style is so creative. <br />    This book is a real eyeopener for many young people. I think all people of 7-15 could enjoy a book such as this!!!!
B00008972S|5.0|The information on this movie is incredible. The ordeal that the dancers went through in making this picture. Jerome Robbins certainly knew what he wanted from his dancers, and it showed in the movie. I love this movie because of how it told the story of \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" in a modern setting. I have seen the musical a couple times and I can say the movie adaptation is wonderfully done. Arguebly, the best movie musical of all time.
B00001W9G0|5.0|\\"Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you did not do than those you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover. Give yourself away to the sea of life.\\" -Mark Twain<br /><br />Katie (Barbra Streisand) and Hubbell (Robert Redford) could not be more different. She is an \\"anti-war\\" activist, while he is content to write novels and observe life from a distance. When life throws them together at college for the first time, they barely notice one another. Then when Katie finds Hubbell in a club, she uses all her feminine wiles to entice him back into her world. Hubbell seems slightly impressed that she loves his writing and that she has even gone to the trouble to find a copy of his book.<br /><br />Katie and Hubbell are truly opposites and that is the attraction. It is the whole \\"liberal\\" falls for \\"conservative\\" story. It is also the \\"woman-loves-man-more-than-man-loves-woman tragedy.\\" While men are attracted to complex women at times, they often just want someone who is easy going and who can help them find that place of \\"nothingness.\\" Katie is just \\"everything.\\" She wants \\"everything\\" and to be \\"everything.\\" She wants to save the world from impending doom.<br /><br />Katie only sees the need for \\"world peace\\" without considering that the freedoms and relative peace she has were the result of wars and sacrifice. She seems to be living in a dream world where everyone loves one another and is happy and equal. She has a very shallow view of communism. Katie lives life as if it is a life-and-death struggle. The needs of the planet come before her romantic interests. She also doesn't realize you are not supposed to drink and smoke while pregnant. There is a way to ruin a child's life!<br /><br />Hubbell almost seems jaded in some ways. He seems to have observed the world and decided it isn't going to change anytime soon, so why not enjoy life before it passes you by. Life is easier for him. He doesn't seem to be fighting life. The way Katie thinks frustrates him, amuses him and eventually exasperates him. All he wants is just to find pleasure and she is always on the hunt for the better life. She pushes him to the edge of himself. He really just wants a woman who will enjoy life with him.<br /><br />There is a scene, wow, how can I say it? Poignant doesn't do it justice. It isn't really emotionally intense because it is more of a picture of resolve. It is just an incredible scene where Katie calls Hubbell and asks him to come over and talk to her because he is her best friend and she needs to talk to him about her break up. Of course, they have just broken up and he is her best friend. So, it makes it a very difficult situation. Imagine losing the person you can talk to about anything and someone who you love the most in the world.<br /><br />The beauty of this movie is in the struggle. Politics aside, this story has enough romance to keep your attention. This is probably a movie that will make a lot more sense while watching it during a war. Especially with what went on at the Academy Awards. At times you have to wonder at the irony of needing war to keep the peace. Ideally we all want peace, but I've always thought that was a dream world. Is Utopia really possible in this life? Still, humans are allowed to dream.<br /><br />If I had the choice between watching people suffer under a tyrant and believing the world was at peace because there wasn't a war OR watching people attain freedom and knowing it was because of a war and sacrifice, I'd choose \\"freedom.\\" Freedom is not free. Saying you want peace, makes \\"you\\" look good, but it doesn't do a darn thing for someone who doesn't have the freedom even to voice their opinions. I think the real heroes are those men and women who go and set people free from the bondage of their tyrannical governments.<br /><br />Katie and Hubbell do seem to find peace in the end even if they don't save the world. What a pity they can't save their own world. What they share has such beauty and freedom. Hubbell really does learn to allow Katie just to say what she wants to say and be who she was born to be. Unfortunately, she is a bit intense.<br /><br />Romantic and Tragic. Maybe some people are only supposed to love each other for a short time even though you wish they could be best friends or partners for life.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewwn world.

B00008S2VG|2.0|Madonna fan - Since first time I saw her on \\"Dancing on Air\\" (a show that was on in Philadelphia).  She performed \\"Everybody\\"<br />As I got older, Madonna's music seemed to change with my taste. Buying every album within 5 days of it's release, there were always a handful songs on every album that would first stick out. Ex - Music - songs that stood out were, \\"Music\\", \\"Impressive Instant\\", \\"Runaway Lover\\", \\"Amazing\\", \\"Don't Tell\\" & \\"Gone\\".  And as I kept listening to them, the other songs would grow on me. The song \\"Paradise\\" I listen to more now then when the album came out.  Madonna's vocals have grown through out her 20+ years singing. And she song writing capability has matured as well, which I also think has been a strong point of Madonna's, one that has been very much over looked.  When Evita was released, for me it brought a whole new sound to Madonna.  Her vocals were more mature, more range then before and this was amplified with the release of  Ray Of Light.<br />And at this point of 20 some years of music, there isn't a Madonna song that doesn't fit a mood I may be in. The albums I still put on frequently to this day are Madonna, Like a Prayer, Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light.  Which brings me to Madonna's new release, American Life.<br />I read a not so pleasant review of American Life, which kind of gave Madonna a back handed complimented stating it was her first bad album in 20 years - which actually is a compliment, not many artist can pick a 20 year span and have releases most critics have liked.  I went and got my copy of American Life and thought \\"oh no, the critic was right\\". Then I was going to write my own review, but I decided to wait and listen a few more times.<br />First, I want to mention the two singles from the American Life album, then separate them from the rest of the songs, \\"American Life\\" and \\"Die Another Day\\".  \\"Die Another Day\\" I instantly liked when it was released from the James Bond movie, but when I saw that it was also going to be on Madonna's new album, I thought it wasn't a good sign. Her other movie songs, \\"I'll Remember\\", \\"This Used to be My Playground\\", \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" to name a few, were never included on a new Madonna release.  Was the album not strong enough that they needed to include an already established hit song?  As for \\"American Life\\", the song had to grow on me, the slow down tempo of the chorus I didn't like, and actually still find annoying.  I have read other people's review on line and those that like \\"American Life\\" praise her for doing a rap in the song stating it to be her first.  Umm, \\"Gene Kelly, Fred Astire, Ginger Rodgers, dance on air\\"- yeah, I think she has rapped in the past.  And for reviews that have made that claim, I automatically discount them because apparently they don't know enough about Madonna's music.  And for the record, the song \\"American Life\\" as a whole, has grown on me.<br />As for the rest of the album, it seems to lack vocal range.  It's not that she isn't singing, or can't sing, it's more of she sings almost the whole album the same, lacking the range that Music had.  With a change in tempo between songs, not much else is different.  Not one song on the album made me go \\"oh, hit repeat and listen to it again\\".  The closest song that made me do this was \\"Mother and Father\\". It is the one song were there is a little vocal range, but when you listen to the lyrics, it doesn't seem as deep as past Madonna albums and the subject, \\"Mother and Father\\", I do believe she covered this area on the Like a Prayer album with \\"Promise to Try\\" and \\"Oh father\\", which are both more endearing.  Much of the American Life album sounds like bland techno, and again, the album is just lacking.  Maybe the song \\"Hollywood\\" or \\"Mother and Father\\" will be the next single releases, but I fear neither will prove to be a \\"Take a Bow\\" hit single.<br />Maybe she has overworked her team work with Mirwais Ahmadzi - co produce and co-writer of many of the songs on the album.  Maybe it's time to work more with Stephan Bray and Patrick Leonard or Shep Pettibone again?<br />Not that anybody reading this knows me from Adam, but I didn't really want to write a not so good review about Madonna, and I try not to compare one album to the next.  But I have heard her do much better, she has always been a mainstay for me, and at 34, I find fewer and fewer new artist to my liking. So when Madonna releases something it's always good to have new music for me to listen to, but not this time.  Yeah, I'll still listen to it, and see if another 20 times listening changes my mind, but until then, I hope Madonna sees a Ray of Light.um.

B000089RVX|5.0|This band blows me away!  I can't remember the last time I heard rock this good.  I also think it's the only CD in my massive collection that DOESN'T have at least one track I hate.  I'm a picky music listener, and a cautious buyer on new stuff, even by artists I like... but I would jump on anything by these guys!  The vocals send chills down my spine, and unlike the generally out-of-character \\"ballads\\" done by 80's rockers like Guns N Roses, the slower songs don't seem out of place at all.  They meld perfectly with every other beat on the disc.  This is what great poetry sounds like as rock music.  What's even wilder is, if you like \\"Bring Me to Life\\" from Daredevil, Evanescence only gets better from there!  Anybody out there looking to sell their old independent album?!?
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  It is heads above the often sour &quot;Music&quot; and surpasses &quot;Ray of Light&quot; simply because there is more and better material. I had not been completely happy with a Madonna album since &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;.  I see that album as very similar to this one. Just because the material is both provacative and catchy. There are even a few songs that remind me of songs from Like a Prayer. &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; is sort of a modern &quot;Like a Prayer, while &quot;Intervention&quot; is a modern &quot;Dear Jessie&quot; To make a long story short. Buy the CD, it is great. The title song is misleading as to how the rest of the CD sounds, its really nothing like the first track. It's amazing!
B000051Y0G|4.0|I, a teen born in thee late 80's, have recently discovered Cyndi's music and it's chilling to see the music that paved the way for today's Britney Spears and Christina Aguileras. Of course, don't take the album for it's face value. Really get into the music and the accompanying lyrics. Then, maybe, you'll understand what bopping is. Lol. A great album that is timeless, and definately worth your money.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Now i am a Madonna fan and wasn't expecting a very danceable album but most of the songs are a step or two up above ballads not very catchy but good!  Standout song:  Hollywood good hook and get stuck in you head!  But not worth 5 stars!
B00005JM93|1.0|Two scenes: a murder, and a rape. Yes they both are really graphic, but it's not what turned me off. I just found the movie to be extremely boring. It's well made, well acted (dupontel was fine, vincent cassel was good, as usual). But my god...after the rape scene I had the urge to fast forward the movie. The film is flat, offers nothing interresting. I don't see what Gaspar Noe was trying to show. It all looks like a very nice marketing experiment. Don't believe the hype...
079074404X|5.0|Forbidden Planet is probably the best work of Hollywood sci-fi ever. I'd be hard pressed to name something better. Star Wars ranks up there, but this movie tops anything I have seen. It's a story about men, their limitations, their love, and their nature. <br />The cinematography is great, and the special effects are almost epic for a movie from the fifties. We get to see a very young Leslie Neilson in a serious role and his performance alone is awesome. The plot comes together quite well at the end, and though you'll probably have some idea towards the end about the resolution of the movie, it's still very enjoyable.<br />However, don't buy anything but a quality DVD or VHS copy of this. This VHS copy is full screen, and plays like a home dubbing. I'd recommend the DVD but the enhanced widescreen VHS edition is watchable.
0800141660|5.0|I love this film. I saw it in the theater, and bought the video soon after. I've watched it again and again because it is simply...lovely. I love reading Jane Austen, and this film, although it alters the book, captures a certain loveliness found in Austen's writing. Sure, it's made more palatable for the 20th century view, but it possesses the comfort, charm, and loveliness that readers will probably still enjoy. It lacks the cleverness of Austen's wit because it is probably impossible to show that in film. Her writing is unique, but the flavor of the film is very true to her oeuvre. Thompson does a great job of capturing the humor of Austen, and the humor of the flawed but likable..and unlikable characters. <br />In this particular version, Brandon is significantly enhanced as a rounder character, and Edward Ferrars is perhaps also more rounded. The younger sister, Margaret has a much greater role than in the novel as well. I read one article that pointed out the more feminist aspects of the film over the book, and I agree with it. The film covers over some of the more difficult inequities between men and women in the regency period, for the sake of making a more acceptable story for contemporary viewers. This, along with an important scene left out, make the film a bit more sweet and lighthearted than the original book. The deleted scene involves a return by Willoughby...hopefully this will entice you to find out more  by reading the book!<br />Film adaptations are fun, usually, but they are not an adequate substitute for reading the original text. You won't understand the richness of language, period, or ideas nearly as well unless you read the original book. That's my English teacher speech. <br />Nevertheless, this film stands completely on its own, and is extremely enjoyable as a film. It's moving, visually beautiful, funny, and informative in some sense. I am particularly fond of the performances by Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, and Greg Wise. There are no bad performances, but I have especially appreciated these. Above all, I think Rickman's performance is quite moving as the quiet, deep, honorable and sad gentleman.
B00008RH1H|5.0|Throne of Blood is Akira Kurosawa's adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. Macbeth has always been my favorite Shakespeare play (of the ones I've read) and I loved Roman Polanski's film version. Kurosawa's film is basically the same story, but set during the samurai era circa 16th century Japan. The legendary Toshiro Mifune plays the Macbeth character, Washizu, an ambitious warrior who is convinced by his wife to murder his lord, thereby taking command in the lord's place. Well, if you've read Macbeth then you know the story. <br />There have been straight-forward adaptations of the play, such as Orson Welles' and Roman Polanski's, but Kurosawa's really gives the story a different feel with its new setting. There's not a whole lot of samurai action here to be found, it's more about the drama, really. The famous finale, however, featuring the flurry of arrows is positively stunning. One of the most memorable moments from any Kurosawa film I've seen. <br />Throne of Blood may be Kurosawa's eeriest film. It has a very creepy atmosphere throughout especially the scenes in the forest and the great scene where Washizu sees the ghost of Miki. It's a very atmospheric film, filled with images of fog moving through the trees, a giant army massing outside the castle, and the finale featuring the forest moving toward the castle as Washizu realizes that he's doomed. It's a great film and a must see for Kurosawa fans.
B000089RVX|2.0|This is nothing more than generic corporate arena rock, slightly (but only slightly) updated from the 70s and 80s.  Lots of bombast, slick production and little else.  This is creativity?  Listen to Interpol, Cat Power or David Gray, please.
B000089RVX|5.0|Okay, i went and saw the movie daredevil, which if jennifer garner and evanescence werent included, the movie would have [been bad]. Thats the only reason i saw that movie.........anywho.......this cd is new and different and i hope no other bands come out like them because this band is incredibley unique and awesome. My fave tracks are \\"whisper\\", \\"Hello\\", \\"My immortal\\" ...god all of them are great but whisper sure sticks out.  BUY THE CD YOU WONT REGRET IT!!I am going to see them in concert for 6 bucks in a few weeks! YES !!!THEY RULE BUY THE CD!
B0000024UO|5.0|Phenomenal studio work, with feeling. The liner notes on this one are good too, providing background to this man's dedication to his craft, which is beyond reproach. It sounds as good today as it did in the 60's, maybe better. Lyrics and the fabulous guitar are all here to some blues favorites that Johnny himself has made classics.
B000002G60|5.0|Suzanne Vega pulls back a bit from the 'left of center' (reference intended) disk of '99.9 F Degrees' w/this album.  Though I loved her first two albums, this one is by far my favorite.  It blends part of the folk aspect of 'Suzanne Vega' and 'Solitude Standing' w/some of the edge of '99.9 F'.  It is the perfect mix. (i purposely do not mention 'Days of Open Hand' b/c I find it is so entirely weak.)<br />There truly is no bad song on this album and producer/then-husband, Mitchell Froom, brings out the best in her performances. \\"Stockings\\", \\"No Cheap Thrill\\", \\"Headshots\\", \\"Birth-day\\" and \\"Honeymood Suite\\" really make the album - though I mentioned, there really is no bad song.<br />I was hoping she would continue in this vein after her marriage broke up.  Her subsequent disk is good - but really reverts back to her first two albums.<br />Obviously w/a five start rating, I would suggest you pick this disk up.
B00008S2VG|1.0|With \\"American Life,\\" Madonna has abandoned her knack for creating some of the most delectable pop songs ever to waft from the radio, instead embracing her inner coffee-house poet. I'm all for an artist growing and staying fresh, but it would best to recognize your limitations. Her artistic pretension is muddled at best, and embarassing most of the time. (Some of the songs unintentionally sound like Phoebe's crack-folk ditties on \\"Friends\\" with added production.) Madonna's voice -- granted, never the most expansive of instruments -- has been so obviously manipulated that it robs the listener of any possiblity of connection with the songs. Lyrically, are we really supposed to care about the cosmic concerns of this woman who has -- much to our entertainment -- made herself one of the most famous and richest in the world, only to be told that none of this really matters? John Lennon, or Joni Mitchell, she isn't. And really, do we really want anything more from her other than some good inventive pop music? Yet, despite some bursts of interesting production touches, there's not a single song here that comes close to the highs of such latter career pop gems as \\"Ray of Light,\\" \\"Music,\\" \\"Take A Bow\\" or \\"Beautiful Stranger.\\" She is lost in the void of overreaching, and the listener is left empty-handed.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Ok, Madonna is an expert showing us new, intelligent and great music... this disc is not the exception.<BR>&quot;American Life&quot; it's her most personal album to date, where she shoots in almost every direction: her parents, the show business, the society in genetal, and a bunch of other things... the sound it's flawless, tracks like &quot;Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Love Profussion&quot;, &quot;Intervention&quot; and &quot;Mother and Father&quot; are easy to hear and swallow... the reason that i gave 3 stars to this CD it's only that &quot;Music&quot; it's more fun, and the bits are more solid... but, well, it's better to have right now a new Madonna CD that have to wait another 3 years to listen something new of this woman.
B00005JL3A|5.0|A great film, but very underrated at that. Yes, Paul Anderson did a poor job informing the viewer of the plot and the characters names. But honestly, who cares? Just pay attention and everything will make sense. The movie is about a team of highly trained special forces commandos who are dispatched to the Hive (an underground Umbrella facility where viral research was going on) who find out that all the specimens and employees have been infected with the T-virus. The special effects in this movie are superb, look at the way the zombie dogs move, real dogs move the same way. Every undead creature looks very realistic, they aren't covered in tomato sauce or anything fake like that. The special effects are arguably as good as those of The Matrix. Paul Anderson even took the time to make sure the plot info concurred with the info given by the game and books. A big step up from the Mortal Kombat movies. I highly suggest you rent it, it's a great movie
B00008S2VG|5.0|first of all, i love the sound of the new miss-m-album. i think it's better than music, because madonna's doing much more the electro-folk-music. after listening to die another day and american life (the first two single releases) i thought the album would be very electronic, using lots of vocoder-samples. but i was wrong. of course there are a few songs using the vocoder, but it doesn't matter.<br />if you like \\"music\\", you will love \\"american life\\"!!!!!
0671042858|3.0|The girl who loved Tom Gordon is a story about a young girl named Trisha. She goes hiking with her Mom and her brother which argued a lot with each other about a lot of things then wanting to have a break and needing to answer a nature's call Trisha gets seperated from them but she can not find her way back. She's lost in the bush.<br />I am a huge Stephen King fan but this one wasn't what I have expected. OK. At least 95% of the plot was regarding Trisha - it almost seemed that King forgot with whom did she go hiking!<br />I struggled but I still made it to the last page when Trisha is finally found.
B0000062GE|4.0|Of the crop of industrial rock acts that appeared after Nine Inch Nails broke the genre into the mainstream, Stabbing Westward was probably the most successful (musically speaking).  Their third album, DARKEST DAYS, takes the harsh industrial sound associated with NIN and builds upon it, making Stabbing Westward rather distinctive.<br />As the title implies, this is a gloomy, emotional album, both lyrically and musically.  Christopher Hall's voice has always been Stabbing Westward's most valuable asset (I'm a die-hard NIN fan and even I'll admit he's a much better singer than Trent Reznor) and here he uses it perfectly.  His delivery is both melodramatic and ironic at turns, giving an amazing sense of power and emotion to lyrics that would be laughable in the hands of a lesser vocalist.  <br />The electronics on this album are equally impressive; unlike some bands who would throw in electronic effects simply to sound interesting, the production tricks on DARKEST DAYS do a superb job of adding to the overall effect.<br />In short, DARKEST DAYS is an ideal album to pick up if you want to expand your interest in industrial beyond Nine Inch Nails, but aren't quite ready to make the jump to more underground acts like Skinny Puppy or :wumpscut:.<br />A final word of warning:  If you like this album, and decide to check out the rest of Stabbing Westward's repertoire, keep in mind that their fourth (self-titled) album is a radical departure from the rest of their work.
B00008S2VH|5.0|Madonna has made her best album since Ray Of Light!!!  I wasnt sure what to expect from this album after reading some of the nasty reviews that I have read so far.  However, I was very surprised at how great 'American Life'is!  The sound of the album is similar to that of her 2000 release 'Music', however the songs are much more interesting and cooler.  Madonna's last album 'Music' had some great songs, however ther were afew songs that were very boring.  That is not the case with her new album 'American Life'.  Every song on this album is fun and interesting, and it is very hard for me to say which song is my favorite.  'American Life' is perhaps Madonna's most personal and provacative album of her career to date.
B000025XKM|5.0|This album is the definition of an artistic swansong. It's like the cooing of a frail thing from a dark cave. Sort of. I like to view the thre Nick Drake albums as concept albums -- Five Leaves Left was his introduction, Bryter Layter was him interacting with society and whatnot, and then Pink Moon was his withdrawal and decline. They're all very very good. The end.
B00008S2VG|2.0|I listened to this album on line a couple of times and I won't be buying it.  I'm not a Madonna hater.  In fact, I've always liked her to a certain degree.  If you bought either of her last two albums, you probably liked about half of each of them, right?  Me, too.  Well, on this one, I'm down to liking two, maybe three songs and the rest are pretty forgettable.  The title track is just plain embarrassing so let's not talk about it.  \\"Hollywood\\" is pretty good, even though it kind of reminds me of \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" in a strange, stripped down way, with Madonna sort of playing around on top of a catchy guitar riff for no particular reason.  \\"Nothing Fails\\" has a great melody and she sings it beautifully, but I'm not sure it needed the gospel choir in the middle as it stood on it's own quite nicely without it.  Imagine \\"Don't Tell Me\\" smoothed out and the quasi-country removed.  All right, \\"Intervention\\" is an okay song, too.  The problem is that once you take the CD out of the player and put it away, you won't be rushing to play it again.  In fact, I'd bet that if you go longer than two days without listening to it, you'll probably forget you even have it.
B00005JKZV|5.0|What can I say about The Two Towers? Answer=  \\"Wow!!!\\"  Part 2 of Lord of the Rings easily beats Part 1.  Just to let you know, part 1 was the greatest movie ever when it came out and was eye popping fun.  Part 2.... Is better than Part 1!!!  You get to spend more time with each of the characters and get to know them more as they continue their journeys.  TTT has better and more fantastic creatures that are even more interesting than the last ones.  TTT has great action.  There is a huge battle scene involving thousands of orcs trying to get the men and elves who are guarding a stone fortress.  That is truly the most amazing movie scene that I have seen.  TTT has lots of comedy.  Gollum is in about more than half of this movie.....And let me tell you,  many of Gollums scenes are extremely funny......especially the \\"skitzo\\" scene.  Gimili, the dwarve, is way way WAYYY funny.  He is like acting seriously, but that seriousness involves comedy to us.  So it isn't like he was trying to make a joke in a corny way.  There are many different places that you will travel to and see in TTT.  Just like the characters,  You get to see and get more involved into the different locations of Middle Earth.  All in all... TTT is really funny in some parts,  filled with action, eye pleasing and the best movie ever made.  I don't know about you all,  but I love it so much that I will end up buying both the theatrical release and extended edition...
B0000025ZF|5.0|you get this album, the pros and cons of hitch hiking. This is one of my 3 favourite albums of all time. Actually it contains one big long song that's something like 42 minutes long.<BR>I can understand people who say they don't like it beacuse it is no easy listening music. You must listen to the album at least 4 or 5 times before you can value its great moments.<br />Best thing to do with this CD is to put it in your car stereo when the sun is shining and the temperature is 23 degrees Celcius and you drive on a lonely high road. Roger Waters is God, as is Eric Clapton ! 6 out of 5 stars :)
B00000272N|5.0|well let me start off by its all about man in the box here but we die young is one great track but when i picked up this album all i listend to was man in the box that song can get you addicted but then i listend to all of the tracks on this tight album its thier first album they made and its a great album they started off with i own only 3 alice in chains albums but i want to get them all so i can have a whole collection alice in chains are my favorite band of all time even though i also love pink floyd im telling you this album got me started with alice in chains and if your new to alice in chains then buy this one or dirt youll be satisfyed with this whole album i dont think it will dissapoint you in anyway (LAYNE STALEY REST IN PEACE MY FREIND)
B00008S2VG|5.0|I am not a Madonna fan and I must be one of the last people to buy her Ray of Light album, when the 3d single was out or so.<BR>I fell in love with RoL and that still is one of the best pop albums ever made, it's up there with Rumours, Dark Side of the Moon, atc.<BR>I did not like her previous album , music, for being too different, i.e. the songs not being coherent. With this album all is well, 11 brilliant songs, not a single weak track!<BR>Favourite tunes are Love Prof, which is absolutely brilliant and Nothing Fails. Also I'm so stupid is a fantastic song.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
B000006OS2|5.0|Hey, there are a lot of good John Wayne movies out there, but this is my personal favorite.  It is lighthearted, at times silly, and just plain fun.  The cast of this film is great, with every character complementing the rambunctious and drunken George Washington Mclintock (Wayne) perfectly.  This film has everything you and I have come to expect from a Wayne western--the fight scene, a couple of funny guys, and the woman he wins over with his gruff, no-nonsense sort of way.  <br />I cannot recommend this movie enough.  Fans of Wayne will love it, and even those who are typically turned off by his shoot-em-up westerns will enjoy this lighthearted comedy.  This is great entertainment for the whole family.
0811826848|3.0|Yes, I know- everyone just loves the Beatles.  Yes, this big cumbersome book is comprised of quotations from the real four men themselves.  But who wants to hear someone talk endlessly about how great they believe themselves to be?  The Beach Boys were a great band, but there is a point where \\"setting the record straight\\" can slip into self-aggrandizing.  There are lots of funny anecdotes in this book if you have the patience to find them.  But this is ultimately more than anyone but a staunch completists needs about a rock band.
B000000WZ4|5.0|It's taken me a long time to realize that this is my favorite DM album. I hated the cover, the title, the single (Barrel of a Gun) and the fact that Barrel was the leading track.  Being the most experimental track on the record you kinda feel like the load has been shot prematurely... I wish it was somewhere in the middle (when I start getting board) although I don't have a better idea for a leading track and you can't re-write history anyway.<BR>   I still don't love Barrel; but The Love Thieves, Home, It's No Good, Useless, The Bottom Line... HOW COULD IHAVE BEEN SO BLIND ?   Sequencing?, cover art?, it seems irrelievent now, (but DM HAD that part down...!?!).<BR>    Always brave, always bold, always leaving us wanting more - this is music, this is life, and I love it.
B000008H24|5.0|When &quot;War Child&quot; came out they were playing &quot;Bungle in the Jungle&quot;.  It seems that with some groups, one of the weakest songs on an album becomes a top 40 hit.  &quot;Bungle&quot; didn't even sound like Tull's style.  But on a friend's advice, I went ahead and bought War Child.  It has some of Ian Anderson's best acoustic guitar (&quot;Only Solitaire&quot;, &quot;Skating Away&quot;).  I turned on to this sound, listened to it a lot, don't like it as much now, but loved it then.  Songs like &quot;War Child&quot; (the sirens at the beginning sound real) &quot;Back-Door Angels&quot;, &quot;Sealion&quot; are some of Tull's best.  &quot;Back-Door Angels&quot; has some great rhythms and heavy electric guitar.  This was more conventional than Tull's previous work but not something I would say fit into mainstream rock and roll.  It went with the time well, although I didn't buy it until early Fall of '75.  &quot;Minstrel in the Gallery&quot; came out at about that same time, both were new to me at the time.  Although I think &quot;Minstrel&quot; is better, &quot;War Child&quot; to me is still one of the best.  The band has excellent musicians and Ian Anderson's lyrics are deep and poetic like Neil Peart's of Rush.
B00008S2VH|1.0|As a loyal fan of Madonna since the early 80s, I am truly saddened that I had to literally *force myself* to listen to this album. It's depressing to see someone who was able to create the phenomenal tracks of \\"Music,\\" \\"Something to Remember,\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\" stumble so terribly at this point in her career. One of my favorite aspects of Madonna is her ability to release great albums year after year after year - for over 20 twenty years! She dropped the ball on \\"American Life\\" in a big way.<br />A positive side to this album are some of the excellent club beats on individual tracks -- the only problem: it was impossible to enjoy them because of Madonna's nonstop whining! And that's the essence of how she comes through on this album -- whiny...trite...tantrum-throwing...bland. Unfortunately, with \\"American Life\\" she's giving ammunition to all of her critics that have claimed for years that she never learned to sing. <br />Skip \\"American Life\\" and save your money for one of Madonna's classics - I recommend \\"The Immaculate Collection,\\" \\"Something to Remember,\\" \\"Music,\\" or even just the single \\"Beautiful Stranger\\" from Austin Powers II.
B000062Y98|5.0|Well, to start off this is my first review ever.I have been listening to Progressive Rock/Metal for years (I bought the first release of Queen on LP (Ok so they weren't &quot;Metal&quot; but they were innovative), but that is in the past and today is the present future.With bands like Rhapsody,Hammerfall, Nevermore, Angel dust,Dream Theatre, and Pain of Salvation moving in new directions for Metal, there is Blind Guardian who have ventured beyond and are pushing the envelope.<br />This was my first Blind Guardian album and I will admit that I did not like it at first, however I kept listening to it and suddenly, there it was in all of it's glory.Some of the most intricate song structures I've ever heard.The harmonies and melodie changes are amazing.Hansi Kursch is a new millenium bard,(He would be paid a King's ransom in medievil times) his songs are masterpieces of chordal structure and lyrics.<BR>If you have never heard Blind Guardian you are missing what I believe are one of the most creative and innovative bands today. (and I'm a huge fan of Dream Theatre , since the beginning) I have since purchased all of Blind Guardians albums and cannot stop listening to them. There is so much depth and emotion and the playing is masssive, yet sutble.From the opening notes of &quot;Precious Jerusalem&quot; to the 14 plus minute of &quot;And then there was silence&quot; you will be taken on a musical journey that will leave you drained for hours! Buy this album, listen to it and keep listening to it , then buy their other albums. You will not regret it.
B000089RVX|4.0|I'm completely impressed, there must be at least a half- dozen four star songs on the cd.  Even it's low point are pretty good.<br />It's encouraging as anything to see a debut splash with this much substance behind it.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Die-hard fans will give a thumbs-up on just about any new material that Fleetwood Mac releases. This CD is really two things:<br />- The Buckingham/Nicks followup album that never was.<br />- The worst Fleetwood Mac album since they joined the group.<br />A few good tunes, such as the title track, and \\"Peacemaker\\", and a few more listenable ones sung by Stevie. That's about it. Lindsey's songwriting here is comparable to his tracks on \\"Tusk\\" - none too good, though he continues as an unusual and interesting guitarist/producer. Not surprisingly, Christine's wonderful pop-sense is sorely missed in this effort.
B00005JL5S|5.0|Stephen Chow has proven himself to be one of the world's finest directors with \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" (aka \\"Kung-Fu Soccer\\"), which was Hong Kong's biggest-ever box-office success when released in 2001.  The simple story of a family of brothers who use Shaolin kung-fu to win the national China soccer tournament against The Evil Team (who use \\"American medicines\\" to win their games) is<BR>bolstered by some hilarious comedy, spirited performances and<BR>very creative special effects.  Outside of the comedic scenes--<BR>which are among the funniest I've seen in a foreign film in a long time--the film's mystical element comes through most uniquely, as during the fabled hypnotic scene involving Mui's steamed bread making.  The part where the brothers are getting beaten to death on the field and then suddenly \\"freeze\\" revert to ancient kung-fu forms was also startling and wonderful.<br />Although banned in mainland China because it was released in Hong Kong before given official certification, this film also works as a glimpse into what the modern-day country looked like in 2001.  \\"Shaolin Soccer\\" was primarily filmed not in Hong Kong but in Shanghai, and uses that city's futuristic-looking new skyscrapers and hip, youthful citizens as a slick, glittery backdrop to its story. Never before has communist China looked this modern, confident and vibrant in a movie.  The special effects, too, are very cutting-edge, and work particularly well during the final soccer match where flying soccer balls become ferocious black tigers, and some kicks are so powerful as to rip the skin right off of the players.  At no point is this movie ever dull or uninteresting, and most of the time it moves at a roaring pace.  The director's cut on the foreign DVD is even better, as it features two lengthy scenes that were cut out of the original, but add to the subplot between Sing and Mui.<br />Whether you are a fan of martial arts, comedy, China, or just <BR>plain good old fashioned filmmaking, this film is for you, and when it is released here in the US this August I hope it becomes<BR>a phenomenon.  Very highly recommended--I have seen it three times now and it continues to grow on me.
0141301066|5.0|Looking back on my twenty-three years, I remember the first time I was introduced to Dahl's writing.  I was in the fifth grade, and our teacher was reading us \\"The Twits.\\"  From that day on I did my best to read all of his books.  Matilda was always my favorite.<BR>This book shows perfectly the differences in Dahl's writings when compared to others.  Dahl was never afraid to create mean charecters that were exactly that.  In Matilda we have a Headmistress that throws kids by their hair and locks them in a box that has broken glass and nail covered walls.  <BR>Don't worry parents.  Dahl isn't out to scare your children.  What I love about his writings is how Dahl creates a story to show how no matter how big the bully is, they can always be overcome by a small child filled with determination and intelligence.  <BR>I hope that every child has the ability to discover the world of Dahl.  A world where it doesn't matter who you are, you can accomplish anything that you set your mind to.  Where the unexplainable it explained.  And where the life of an old english man touched the life of millions of children across the world.  <BR>The world needs more Roald Dahls.  May his life live on through those he's impacted.
B00008S2VG|2.0|After the dreadful MUSIC album I thought Madonna would come back to her fun side on her latest AMERICAN LIFE. The question here is: What is Madonna still trying to prove with this electronic mess? AMERICAN LIFE is worse than MUSIC. This time the subject matter focuses on Madonna herself and how she sees American society. To her, Americans need to wake up and stop looking only at the pretty things as expressed on the first single \\"American life.\\" <br />She continues to look at fame on \\"Hollywood\\", which is a surprisingly fun song to listen too. She also takes a hard look at herself on \\"I'm so stupid\\" (good beat). Unfortunately only a handful of songs on AMERICAN LIFE are actually fun. What happened to Madonna's fun side? Ever since RAY OF LIGHT she got all dull and serious. The production on here is very similar to her previous, MUSIC. It's got the same electronic blips and blurps with a lot of guitar work. I'll give her credit for this; some of the beats on here are awesome. <br />The production on \\"Hollywood\\", \\"I'm so stupid\\" and \\"nobody knows me\\" are some of the best here. The rest of the CD is terrible. The track \\"mother& father\\" is so bizarre you really don't know whether to feel sorry for her or to break out dancing. The lyrics don't match the music what-so-ever. Tracks like \\"nothing fails\\", \\"intervention\\", and \\"x-static process\\" are so dull you'll need to slap yourself awake. <br />AMERICAN LIFE also includes \\"die another day\\" from the James Bond movie of the same name. Whoever suggested putting that track on here made a very smart decision. It almost saves this album. AMERICAN LIFE is hard to digest. To me, only about 6 songs are worthy. Note to Madonna: next time you want to do some more self-examination, write a book! Don't bore us with another album like this. AMERICAN LIFE is al global mess.
0385507755|3.0|<br />The plot arc: Spoiled rich kid with tough-guy attitude and severe alcoholism/crack addiction has his parents pay for a stay at the exclusive Hazelden clinic in Minnesota.  Goes in a busted-up, addicted idiot.  Comes out a semi-repaired, sober jerk. <br />In fairness to him, he's still in early sobriety when he leaves, and he's still young. But when he leaves the clinic doors he's determined not to learn anything from anyone.  He forgets that \\"self-made men are self-evident\\".  <br />Those criticisms aside, James Frey's book has its moments. Some of the writing is beautiful, particularly when there are fewer I's jumping out at you.  The story itself is easy to read and has a voyeuristic quality to it some readers will like. <br />There are some interesting characters he meets.  I found myself skimming a lot by the middle of the book because of its repetitiousness. The ending is very formulaic and his last gesture probably seems different to those around him than it did to him. That is, it was melodramatic silliness.  For a guy with supposed ruthless honesty, he's remarkably sentimental. <br />This is a worthwhile read.  But it's not the War and Peace of addiction, as it says on the back cover...
B000000OQF|5.0|The significance of this album is unquestionable. This was the 80s metal album that united those who liked hair metal (Poison, Warrant, etc), and thrash metal (Metallica, Megadeth, Anthrax, Slayer). It's an excellent mix of blues, hard rock, attitude and machismo. <BR>Guns N Roses were one of the most essential and important bands of the 1980s. Axl Rose's aggressive and shrieking vocals were very adequate (despite the fact that he burned out too quickly and cheated his fans), and Slash's blistering guitar solos are amazing, and he's certainly one of the best guitarists ever. \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Sweet Child O'Mine,\\" \\"Paradise City,\\" and \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" are already rock radio classics that still sound juts as awesome today as they did back in 1987. You can still feel the power of the band in those songs, and for other songs on this album like \\"Night Train,\\" \\"Out To get me,\\" and \\"Rocket Queen.\\" What a great album. I listened to this all the time when I was 6 when I'd steal my Dad's tape of it, until my parents took it away from it because of all the 'dirty words' on it. It is one of the most essential albums of all time, especially in such an era like the late 80s where bad music was just as normal as apple pie.
1565847873|2.0|The setting and the characters promise a great read. And while the books is easy to get thru and diverting enuf, it is far too<BR>simplistic and predictable; like a TV crime episode. There are far too many far-fetched turns to make it believable. The basic political tenet is never really explained or backgrounded. This is a great shame as the book's theme and characters hold so much promise.
B00006RIO7|5.0|I love this recording of &quot;Chicago&quot;. The movie is wonderful; one of the best musicals made into a movie-musical I have ever seen. Catherine Zeta-Jones was OUTSTANDING in the role of Velma Kelly. She has such amazing vocals, and in the film, her dancing is remarkable. Renee Zellwegeer is perfectly cast as Roxie Hart. She added such life to Roxie, and the sultry vocals and the smooth tones of her voice are just wonderful. Richard Geere wasn't that bad as Billy Flynn! He can really sing! I loved his rendition of &quot;They Both Reached for the Gun&quot;. It was just a wonderful record and just an outstanding movie-musical,and all that jazz!
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin 2 may be my favorite Zeppelin album. It's definitely the most consistent CD I have (I have 54). \\"2\\" is just so amazing in the fact that it was recorded in so little time. It really shows off how talented all four of the guys are. For example, Jimmy Page plays such great riffs on almost every song. My particular favorite is \\"Bring it on Home\\", the second part of the song. Plus, he wrote the songs. Robert Plant shows off his versatility as a singer. He uses his voice with the mood of the song so well. No one can do the same things as Plant can. John Paul Jones proves that he is as good as a musician as Jimmy with those great bass lines on \\"Ramble On\\" and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be.\\" He isn't half bad as a keyboardist either on \\"Thank You.\\" John Bonham makes everyone who hears him on \\"Moby Dick\\" say \\"Is that really possible?\\" He really was one of the best drummers in all of rock.<BR> Though there isn't as much variety on this album as there was on some of the others, \\"2\\" is unbelievable on every other aspect. If you like rock, you'll like this.
0440211727|5.0|While not short at over 500 pages, this is still a vert fast read. Even though the defendant Carl Lee Hailey clearly committed the crime, you find yourself rooting for his acquittal throughout the entire book. With the other storylines the Grisham works in (i.e. - the KKK vs. the African-American contingent, the attacks on Brigance, etc.), every page becomes crucial to the storyline. Grisham's language skills are near perfect and his style of writing keeps you reading and reading and reading...and before you know it you've burned up two and a half hours! I fully recommend this book. My first Grisham, but certainly not my last.<br />FREE CARL LEE!

B0000214F0|1.0|This film was so sexually explicit that I broke down and cried several times during the viewing.  How am I supposed to be a good, patriotic, sexually repressed American when such filth is in my DVD library.  I am shocked that Bob Guccione would produce a film with so much nudity.  I thought he had class.  I guess I expected more of a light-hearted romantic comedy with a little bit of Roman Empire thrown in.

B000083C49|3.0|I am a big Trek fan, and I loved the other movies (especially \\"Star Trek: The Movie\\", with V'ger), but the story of \\"Star Trek IV\\" is just plain stupid.<BR>I mean, ut was pretty entertaining to see our beloved Admiral James T. Kirk shout \\"Double Dumbass on you!\\" at a car driver, but again, the story...<BR>\\"We have just come back from a tiring journy to Genesis and then to Vulcan, and we are flying our way back to earth, but oh wait! We have to make a quick stop at the 20th century to bring back a couple of Humpback Whales to save the planet from an alien whale race...\\"<BR>I'm sorry, this is not the Star Trek style I love so much, so does splashing in the waters of San-Francisco after returning home...<BR>If you are new to this whole Star Trek thing, don;t let this movie fool you. Star Trek is a wonderful series of movies (and a TV serise) full of intersting storylines and characters, but this one is just plain silly..
0451191153|5.0|This was my first Ayn Rand book to read, a easy, understandable read because its in the form of a fictional novel.  The main reason I like this book and felt angry sometimes is because Howard(the main character) gets [bothered] alot but he doesn't care, he is too pure.  I was getting mad at him for not getting upset.  It was fairly easy to understand Ayn Rands philosophies on life because they were portrayed through the characters.  I think if you read this book you will be surprised at how it will affect the way you feel about yourself and your ego.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Faceless is the brand-new album from Godsmack. As soon as you switch it on to hear the sounds of batlle commencing, you know your onto something special. \\"straight out of line\\" really does show how mutch Godsmack have refined their sound, and with the added skill and power of Shannon Larkins drumming, they really have started something. four songs in, four guitar solos in, and it just gets better. Their is an unrefined beauty to \\"i f*cking hate you\\" that really sends a shiver down your spine. Sully's vouce really has reached its peak, and he can really cut the line between haunting and downright nasty. Things slow down towards the end with the haunting \\"serenity\\". all in all, all the tracks stand out in their own way, and if you like no-frills heavy rock then this will be the album for you.
B00005S6K6|5.0|De Niro and Streep did an exceptional job in this romantic film. The love felt between the characters is very touching. I am a helpless romantic,therefore, this film is a plus and a must for romantics to see.
B00008DDXC|3.0|I really liked the first Harry Potter movie but I felt this one just doesn't live up to that. Harry really is a poor excuse for a wizard. He really doesn't know how to do anything. Things just happen for him. He's really lucky. The bird flies in just at the right time. The sword appears just at the right time. The car arrives just at the right time. Harry controls nothing. Everything just conveniently shows up. I think the story is very weak, often confusing, and often boring in this movie. It's just not what I was expecting.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Why does Linkin Park have to call themselves: rap-metal? They show little resemblemce to that genre. The same can be said for most of the &quot;nu-metal&quot; bands. Cmon, what is this people? Stop calling Staind and Creed &quot;nu-metal&quot;, it's embarassing if you say it in front of the old-skool rockers. <BR>   Linkin Park is NOT unoriginal. Do they sound like Korn? Does Chester's voice sound anything like Jon's? Do their music videos have the same mood and tone to it? They are original, so you can stop feeling uneasy now, buyer. Unlike Korn, Limp Bizkit(yuck), and Rage, Linkin Park's rap and rock are distinctly separate. Why? Because they have one guy for singing and one guy for rapping. I don't want to do the comparisons again, so I'm going to get the CD.<BR>      Don't judge it by the average 4/5 rating. I think some of the people who give the CD that rating are either Limp Bizkit fans or Puff Daddy fans. I definitely know some guys who listen to rock loving Hybrid Theory, but hated this. I listen to only rock, but rap seems to fit well here in this CD. If you've heard somewhere I Belong, you can hear how well integrated the rock and rap are, yet still separate. Buy this CD if you're a rock listener who keeps an open mind about music. Note though, that this is more rock than rap. I don't think you should buy this if you only listen to rap.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I can't tell you how refreshing it is to hear this type of music from a band most of us thought was history. Unlike almost every album since &quot;Tusk, circa &quot;79&quot;. &quot;Say you will&quot; blends the vocals of Buckingham and Nicks to near perfection. Nearly all of the albums since Rumours have been a showcase for individual songs by each of the vocalists. This album showcases just how well Nicks &amp; Buckingham can blend their voices for that unique sound of the Mac. Not to detract from Christine McVie but, she is barely missed on this effort. The tracks &quot;Edward R. Murrow...&quot;, &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Say you Will&quot;, &quot;Peacekeeper&quot;, &quot;Smile at you&quot;, &quot;Everybody finds out&quot;, and &quot;Destiny rules&quot; are enough to recomend this album to anyone who has ever loved Fleetwood Mac. I figured with &quot;The Dance&quot; that the band was pretty much finished, ( A cash in like The Eagles, &quot;Hell Freezes Over&quot; album. But, hey was I wrong! A lot of the newer bands might want to stand up and take note of what talent and experience can bring! Oh, and Don Henley, you might want to take note as well.<BR>The Mac Is Back!
078322608X|5.0|12 Monkeys in no small measure of the term is quite an intriguing science fiction tale.  Starring box office favorites such as Bruce Willis, Brad Pitt and Madeline Stowe also sets this film apart as a film that was destined to succeed.  Bruce Willis's performance is nothing short of phenomenal as we see him in a role where he's still the hero of the film, but a much more contemplative, melodramatic one.  Even when the plot calls for action, he goes about it quite differently than we'd seen him in films prior to and after this great film.  I'm not normally a big fan of Brad Pitt, but his performance in this film shows what a talented actor he is, with a great range of skills to draw from.  Madeline Stowe, as beautiful and talented as ever performs admirably as a psychiatrist drawn to Willis's character.  For me, one of the most interesting aspects of this great film is the time travel.  I've always found films that feature this to be most intriguing, if done as well as it has been done with this film.  Taken as a whole, this film stands out as a science fiction classic that bears multiple viewings easily.<br />The premise:<br />We meet Bruce Willis's character James Cole who is a prisoner living underground with the rest of humanity, some thirty odd years beyond 1996.  They believe that late in 1996 the army of the twelve monkeys released a viral agent in several cities resulting in the near extinction of the human race.  James Cole is tapped to \\"voluntarily\\" be sent back to 1996 and discover who is behind the army of the twelve monkeys and hopefully obtain a sample of this viral agent so that they might be able to find a cure for it and hopefully bring humanity back from the brink and above ground.<br />Given that science can sometimes not be exact, they drop James into 1990 where he finds himself being thrown into a mental ward where he meets Brad Pitt's wacky character and psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly who takes him under her wing.  What follows from this pointis certainly to be considered another fine addition to the genres list of classics.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />The Hamster Factor and other tales of 12 Monkeys (The making of 12 Monkeys) - This is quite and intriguing hour and a half long look at director Terry Gilliam and what it took for them to put this outstanding film on the silver screen.<br />Feature Commentary with director Terry Gilliam and producer Charles Roven.<br />Production notes - An interesting text version that pretty much sums up what was revealed in the \\"The Hamster Factor.\\"<br />Cast &amp; Filmmakers - A great text synopsis of the cast &amp; filmmakers.<br />Theatrical Trailer
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's sophmore release \\"Stripped\\" is one of the most mature albums I've heard to date by a pop artist. Christina's album in my opinion shouldn't even be placed in a genre because of the many different influences on each song. I think she is definatly and artist who can convey alot of feeling and message within her music as well as her voice.<BR> 1. Stripped Intro - Very cool intro, just Christina tellin' ya how it is... 10/10<BR> 2. Can't Hold Us Down - Don't play around with these ladies (Xtina & Lil' Kim) ...! 10/10<BR> 3. Walk Away - I love the bridge to this song it's melody is so different from the rest of the song and you can her the emotion in Xtina's voice on that particular part the best. 10/10<BR> 4. Fighter - I cannot get enough of this song! It's a total rock'n'roll song, plus you got Dave Navorrow in there doin' his thing. HOT SONG!   10/10<BR> 5. Primer Amor Interlude - Christina talkin' about her first love and first impressions...we've all had our first loves... 10/10<BR> 6. Infatuation - Very latin type song, which fuses with her roots...plus it is got some amazing vocals. 10/10<BR> 7. Love Embrace Interlude - I thought she could've done more with the interlude, but the melody for the song is good. 9/10<BR> 8. Loving Me 4 Me - I like this track it's very RnB set, and in kinda the tone you'd here from Urban Divas like Jill Scott or Erkica Badu... 10/10<BR> 9. Impossible - Alicia Keys & Christina Aguilera...I mean what more is there to say about this song except that it is impossible to get it outta your head! smashin' pumpkins'! 10/10<BR> 10. Underappreciated - I like this track because Christina really conveyed the feeling inside the song of what it really feels like to be underappreciated in a relationship or anywhere for that matter! 10/10<BR> 11. Beautiful - Simplistic melody and lyrics, also an anthem for anyone of this generation about excepting yourself...Beautiful! 10/10<BR> 12. Make Over - I like this tune although her voice does sound very wavy and studio done, but I think that is what she was shooting for. 10/10<BR> 13. Cruz - Totally love this song...just one of those summer car jams! Sheryl Crow better watch her step>>> 10/10<BR> 14. Soar - Excepting yourself for who you are, like \\"Beautiful\\", but with this track she implies more of a gospel tone. Love It! 10/10<BR> 15. Get Mine, Get Yours - OK...this song is about casual [relationships] if anyone didn't know that...but anyways...I thought the song was very well written and true to it's title. 10/10<BR> 16. Dirrty - This is my favorite track of the album...The song totally blew my mind away (As did the video) of what to expect when Xtina was coming back into the spotlight...plus it's a hot dance song at a club. I love it! LET\\"S GET DIRRRRTYYY!   20/10<BR> 17. Stripped Pt.2 - Hey she is very truthful to her fans and she doesn't care what anyone thinks... plus I thought this little interlude totally set her apart from Britney. 10/10<BR> 18. The Voice Within - WoW...Blew me away with emo...I totally thought this song should be for everyone and that the \\"girl\\" vocals should be cut to be unisex or somethin'. But never-the-less it is an amazing song with a bridge that will totally blow you away. 10/10<BR> 19. I'm OK - Dealing with this certain subject on the record...she definatly set herself apart from many of her peers with this heartfelt track. 10/10<BR> 20. Keepin' On Singin' My Song - I loved the end track, it was a perfect way to end the record. Just kind of making a summary of what she went through with each song, and put all into one with amazing vocals...especially the high note on \\"SOOOONG\\" right after the bridge.     20/10
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park does one thing and they do it well, and that's their combination of hard-rock angst and turn-table ambiance with utter near perfection. Most rap-rock bands are content to use the same drop-D chords over and over underneath cliched hip hop beats and constant cussing (which makes Linkin Park refreshing, considering both Hybrid Theory's and Meteora's surprising lack of four letter words, a welcome relief). <br />I would even go so far as to call these guys a modern day Rush, or at least they're showing signs of becoming that. Their music has a super-produced, meticulous attention to detail that comes out in every song and makes for a very rewarding listening experience. I thought Reanimation was one of the most ambitious mainstream albums in a long time and I'm glad to see Meteora isn't just a rehash of Hybrid Theory. These guys have musical talent, no doubt about it.<br />That said, there's still one thing that hasn't much improved, and that's the lyrics. Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda both have really great voices, it's just too bad they don't really sing about anything. Every song has the same vague, pseudo-angst ridden existential poetics that many a 15 year old kid with &quot;issues&quot; could scribble out. Granted, bands like Metallica are much the same in that respect, and I guess that's why they appeal to such a wide audience. But Lyrics are just as important as the music behind them, and for this bands musical talent, the overall lack of meaning in their songs is kind of a glaring let down. <br />Still, I hold out hope that as they mature, LP will continue exploring more precise themes and make some truly great music.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I'm not sure if this is Fleetwood Mac or Buckingham/Nicks reuniting for an album, but all in all, it really doesn't matter.....this IS music!!! It's well written, easy listening, words you can clearly understand, words spoken from the heart. I have listened to it over and over, as I have with all of their music since the 70's. I'm a fan. They could never disappoint me. If you're looking for something to 'continue the Fleetwood Mac story', then this is for you. It doesn't matter that Christine isn't on here, it's enjoyable and that's what music is all about.
B00003CXFG|5.0|This was a good movie. It explores what people would do to save themselves when placed in complicated circumstances. I hate that the person who starts to humanize Riddick gets killed in the end.<br />I enjoyed watching the movie with the commentary of the actors and director. Even though Vin Diesel said it was asinine to do so, I think the talking made it seem as if I wasn't watching the movie alone. I appreciate the company. (Listening to Vin's \\"so sexy\\" voice makes it a pleasant experience). If you don't like when people talk back to the movie screen, watch it without the comments.
B00005RDSM|5.0|I never get tired of watching Peter Pan, probably because the concept of flying children introduced me to never-ending possibilities as a child. <br />I highly recommend this movie to children, parents, people of all ages. The first time I saw this movie I was a child and the last time I saw it was about a month ago at the age of 19.

0307165485|5.0|Like other reviewers, this was one of my favorite books as a child.  Since the contents of the book have been covered in other reviews, I wanted to mention a few other things.  First, I can proudly say that my 3-year-old son is currently thrilled with my original copy.  Second, I believe that this book has much to offer in terms of pre-reading skills.  When I pulled this book out for my son last year, I looked through it fondly, and vividly recognized almost all of the pictures.  Interestingly, though, I didn't remember the words; I had memorized all of the pictures and created my own stories as a very young child.  I was a very early reader; I was reading novels of 300-400 pages in the third grade.  I believe that that had much to do with my desire to sit and \\"read\\" books on my own as a toddler.<br />Richard Scarry's Best Storybook Ever is designed for a child to work through on his/her own.  My son \\"reads\\" to himself for about an hour each day (self-inflicted!) and he already matches letter sounds to words.  I'm not a believer in the genetics argument for most children; I believe that children learn to read early, and learn to have a love for books based on the environment provided for them.  This book is a fantastic way to begin to set that environment for your child.
B00006BTCA|5.0|They dress nice and the lead singer sounds like ian curtis from JOY DIVISION. You'd have to be living under a rock not to have been overwhelmed with the hype on  INTERPOL.  The best thing about &quot;turn on the bright lights' is that it's really good.  The music has a perfect rythm section and searing guitars that hook you into there indie goth pop rock. It's really hard not to listen this record and not be instantly addicted. Yes, it's very nostalgic of everyones fave 80's post punk bands but what band isn't these days.  Check out song roland or obstacle one. I am very interested in seeing what becomes of this band.
B00005ASOI|1.0|With all due respect, if you think this is \\"one of the scariest movies ever made,\\" you have not seen nearly enough scary movies.  Suspiria is indeed frightening...frighteningly bad.  Don't try to find any semblance of a cohesive plot...there is none.  Rather, we get a series of badly acted scenes intended to spook us but which merely made me laugh out loud at the ineptitude on screen.  Funniest of all, perhaps, was the obviously fake bat and fake dog, which were no doubt purchased at the toy store down the street.<br />A couple of violent scenes do interrupt what seems like hours of plodding, boring exposition.  But these death scenes are so amateurish, so badly executed, that you'll laugh yourself silly watching them.  Of course, if you like watching endless scenes of people dancing, this is the movie for you.<br />Actually, there is one good part of the film...the closing credits.  Finally, this ... has come to an end!
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a very good Sci-Fi story, but I am giving only 4 stars because there are better books out there.  This is more of a coming of age story suitable for younger Sci-Fi readers.  Those who expect a techno Sci-Fi thriller may be disappointed.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|&quot;Say you Will&quot;starts out slow,but then,all hell brakes lose when you get to track 4, Stevie's,&quot;Thrown Down.&quot;This is one of the best songs I've heard in YEARS.I can't stop playing it.Even though Nicks solo CD's have been huge,she needs Lindseys production skills,and this song proves it.My other favorite Stevie Nicks cuts, &quot;Everybody Finds Out,&quot;(This one really Rocks)&quot;Say you Will,Silver Girl,Illume,&quot;(9-11).Lindsey Buckingham always has a more experimental sound.One of my all time favorite albums was his 1992 CD,&quot;Out of the Cradle.&quot; Alot of his tracks sound like that record.My favorites,The hit single,&quot;Peacekeeper,Bleed to Love Her,&quot; and the beutifull,&quot;Say Goodbye.&quot; I really love playing this record,but Christine McVie is missed,even though she is listed as one of the additional performers,along with Sheryl Crow.I honestly have to say &quot;Say You Will&quot; is Fleetwood Mac's greatest album next to &quot;Rumours.&quot;
B00005176F|3.0|It's very hard to argue (the fact) that this Best Of album is THE place for coming-of-age Blur fans to start their journey.  But alas, to their longtime fans, this might reveal itself as not exactly what they want.  Sure, anytime you have a greatest hits album you're going to have a few songs that could've been included but weren't.  And as I am a big fan of Blur (I'm speaking of the self-titled CD here), I feel there are a number of tracks that should've been featured along with these 18.  My Best Of CD does have a second disc, but I think it should've been with studio versions, not live versions of the same songs on disc one.  I will say that all these songs deserve to be here; there`s no arguing that.  But since these reviews can be and are opinionated, I will state my case.<br />First of all, the organization of these tracks seems to be a little discombobulated.  Another reviewer said the track listing was a blur in itself; and that explains it almost perfectly.  The only thing that seems to make sense is putting \\"Song 2\\" as track two.  Other than that, it is somewhat strange.  But really, that's neither her nor there.  You won't need to get up and hit the shuffle button this time around.  Next, I'll list five songs that I would have included on this release had I been given the chance to do so (use your imagination here... stay with me):<br />1. \\"Death Of A Party\\" - this dark and almost scary track from the self-titled disc is easily one of my favorites.  A few other people have said this track was worthy, but apparently the band didn't think so.  Without this track, I believe the Best Of album lacks a gloomy track; something Blur (the CD) became infamous for.<br />2. \\"M.O.R.\\" - I am certainly not alone when I say this song deserved to be here.  It's an evident favorite for many Blur fans and consequently has become a hidden gem with its absence here.  It just might've missed the cut due to the fact it's so similar to the band's earlier `brit-pop' sound that their earlier CDs like Modern Life Is Rubbish offered.<br />3. \\"Swamp Song\\" - although (probably) not one of Blur's best, it was one of the best from the underrated classic 13; which is not represented too well by this album.  It doesn't have the appeal that the two singles \\"Coffee And TV\\" and \\"Tender\\" bring to the table, but it is still amazing; both lyrically and especially musically.<br />4. \\"Strange News From Another Star\\" - I might be the only person on the planet that thinks this track is worthy of a spot on a Best Of Blur disc.  This is one of, if not my favorite track from Blur: the album and the band.  Unfortunately, it goes (mildly) overlooked because it is towards the end of the CD.  If you liked the Blur CD I don't see how you can't like this song.<br />5. \\"Pressure On Julian\\" - with this selection you're probably wondering `what the heck?'.  But come on, was this not one of the better tracks on Modern Life Is Rubbish?  There's no question it's overlooked; and therefore the only question is whether it's worthy or not.  I don't know, I just enjoy the song.  That's all it comes down to.<br />When all's said and done, these are just my opinions; nothing more and nothing less.  Do not let my review (and 3-star rank) lead you to believe this is not a worthy purchase.  This is, hand's down, THE place to start for anyone who  has only recently come to enjoy Blur.  But for anyone who already owns all the Blur albums, this is nothing spectacular.  Minus the finale track, \\"Music Is My Radar\\", nothing new and/or special appears (unless you want the second live disc).  Once more, this is a must-have for coming-of-age Blur fans; but a questionable choice for the diehards.eir earlier CDs like Modern Life Is Rubbish offered.<br />3. \\"Swamp Song\\" - although (probably) not one of Blur's best, it was one of the best from the underrated classic 13; which is not represented too well by this album.

B00005JKNF|4.0|When I first watched GOSFORD PARK I didn't realize the hype. But when I put a little thought into it, and learned to appreciate the wonderful ensemble cast, the film was pretty magnificent.<br />With actors chosen for merit and talent instead of name and face, PARK truly produces a wonderful storyline set in a unique and visually beautiful period.<br />The overtones of ...  mystery are abound, but the real film lies within the eyes of the actors. Everywhere in the movie you can carefully study the eyes and facial reactions along with the imagination of what each actor is thinking and truly bring a powerful motion picture to heart.
B000089RVX|5.0|I have not purchased a CD in three years, that's right, three years! That is until I heard Evanescence. The songs on this cd fit everyone's mood, from being in a party mood to just wanting to be mellow. Evanescence is a great change from the usual nonsense called music that pollutes the radio now.<br />Tracks to watch:<br />My Immortal - Great &quot;chill out&quot; song. Amy has a great voice, and it shows the most on this track. Best song on their CD in my opinion.<br />Bring Me To Life - Current their #1 single, off the Daredevil soundtrack. Great song.<br />Tourniquet - Might be their next single, great song all around, fast paced.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The greatest screen story of all time comes to the greatest DVD set of all time.<br />No matter your opinion of the third GODFATHER, this DVD set truly encapsulates the epic that is THE GODFATHER.

Using a decidedly Star-Wars-Star-Trek flavor, SPACEBALLS allows anyone who grew up in the 1980s a true appreciation of his comedy, as well as the sci-fi adventures that replaced the western.<br />Third best to Brooks's ROBIN HOOD: MEN IN TIGHTS and YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN, SPACEBALLS delivers sight gag and punctuality not seen since Airplane!

B000001DTM|5.0|Those four boys from Dublin reached their peak in the 90's with this album, reaching a level of popularity that would not again be seen until the release of All That You Can't Leave Behind.  After Joshua Tree, Bono and the boys decided they had to think it all up again, and let me tell you, rock n' roll will forever be thanking them.<br />Achtung Baby is, in my opinion, the best of any of U2's albums.  Yes, Joshua Tree is a masterpiece but I feel that Achtung far surpasses it.  It's darker and more rythmic and sexy.  From the opening warning horn in Zoostation to the final strains of Love Is Blindness, this album is a strong and cohesive work of music.<br />This album is actually my favorite album of all time and I never grow tired of listening to it.  Some of my favorite tracks, besides the perenially popular One and Mysterious Ways, are The Fly, Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, and Ultraviolet.<br />You can't call yourself a U2 fan if you don't own this album.  And even if you're not a U2 fanatic, Achtung Baby is a masterpiece that is an essential addition to any music buff's collection.
B00006JKON|1.0|&quot;Only Solitaire&quot; is quite possibly a reply to a certain Steve Peacock, who wrote in &quot;Sounds&quot; on March 11, 1972 that &quot;One of the most disillusioning experiences of my musical life occurred when I saw Jethro Tull for the second time... and everything was exactly the same - practically every note of the music (bar the goofs) and all the jokes and asides. I can't help feeling that someone who has his ad-libs rehearsed that carefully needs watching a little carefully, and I've been a little wary of Jethro Tull ever since.&quot; Not wary enough, it seems.<br />Ad rem, however: Someone below quotes the liner notes thus: &quot;`The inclusion in this re-mastered edition of some extra tracks recorded at the same time but left off the original release due to time constraits [sic] (ever the problem with vinyl) will please some and irrate [sic] others but it is time they joined their brothers and sisters after so many years.'&quot; &quot;War Child&quot; was Jethro Tull's SEVENTH studio album. I have great difficulty believing the group had to discover anew at each recording session that only so many songs will fit on a vinyl disc. Ordinarily I'd assume that these so-called &quot;bonus tracks&quot; were originally excluded because they were judged inferior (they are OUT-TAKES), and ask why, if they weren't up to snuff then, should you want them now. Ordinarily I'd assume this and ask that, but, really, what could possibly be inferior to &quot;The Third Hurrah&quot; and &quot;Two Fingers&quot;? Either way, the &quot;bonus tracks&quot; are here to trick you into buying the same album twice or three times. There is perhaps some excuse for buying &quot;War Child&quot; once (that is, if you hadn't actually heard it first); there is no excuse for buying it twice.
0060278250|5.0|This book is mythologically rich (if you know where to look) and riveting...it's still one of my all time favorites and will be no matter how I old I am.<br />For a story that has deep characters, heart-felt struggles, an element of [fear] and uplifting lessons for any child or adult dark at heart...this is the book!
0780625129|5.0|Edward Norton could probably play anyone, he is one of the best actors out there.  In this film, he stars as a leader of a neo-nazi group.  His father was killed a few years earlier, and Norton is a very angry and bitter person now.  His behavior is tearing apart the family, and he soon gets arrested for murder.  While in jail, he changes his views and no longer wants to be a skin-head in the neo-nazi group.  When he getys out of prison, he leaves the group and everyone turns against him.  He's in all kinds of trouble then.  This movie is very powerful and the performances are just incredible.  I highly reccomend you see it.  It's a little disturbing at times, but it's very moving.
B00007G1ZM|5.0|Director Michael Curtiz (\\"The Adventures of Robin Hood,\\"  Casablanca\\") brings another James M. Cain (\\"Double Indemnity,\\" \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\") steamy pulp novel to life on the silver screen with the immortal \\"Mildred Pierce.\\"<br />With her portrayal as the title character, Joan Crawford gives a performance that places her in such august company as Barbara Stanwyck as the bottle blonde Phyllis Dietrichson in \\"Double Indemnity\\" (1944, dir: Billy Wilder) and Lana Turner's ambitious Cora in \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" (1946, dir: Tay Garnett). <br />Mildred, like Cora, is a driven woman, bent on commercial success. Crawford rightly earned the Best Actress Oscar for her role as the modern businesswoman, a model of ruthless ambition, making her mark and her way in a traditionally man's world. Following her transformation from ditched housewife to waitress to restauranteur<BR>and tycoon, the viewer readily identifies with Mildred's struggle and sacrifice to make it big. \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is one of the screen's all-time inspirational portrayals of woman as efficacious heroine, a paragon of efficiency.<br />Yet, it is also a deeply human tragedy of Shakeperian dimensions, for Mildred is also a flawed heroine, on the same scale as Othello or Hamlet. What drives Mildred is not a clean motivation such as personal fulfillment as a businesswoman nor even a simple one such as amassing a fortune to obtain financial security. Rather, Mildred is driven by a Fatal Flaw -- insecurity and fear of failure.<br />For it is not the curse of the ancient Greek tragic heroes -- hubris -- but utter selflessness and altruism that brings down the House of Mildred. The object of Mildred's Mother Teresa-like compassion and sacrifice is the one person who holds veto power over her emotions and wallet, her conceited eldest daughter Veda, played by Ann Blyth. What Veda wants, Veda gets. The ultimate spoiled daughter, her lower middle-class parents give her \\"the best of everything\\" (punintended -- another great Joan Crawford flick, also produced by Jerry Wald), from piano lessons to tailored dresses. Bent of giving Veda \\"everything I couldn't have,\\" Mildred's motivation is for her daughter to not only rise above, but to blot out the family's humble and plebian origins.<br />After her husband, the wooden but commonsensical Bert (played by Bruce Bennett) leaves her for another woman, Mildred becomes a waitress in order provide for Veda. She even hires a maid, but never divulges to Veda the nature of how the money comes in to put food on the table. She is literally ashamed to face Veda with her workaday persona, and when confronted, makes up a story about being a waitress in order to learn the restaurant business.<br />So, playing the role, Mildred opens a restaurant, and to her surprise, learns she's got the knack for it. But, as she becomes more successful, and as the money rolls in, Veda's avaricious appetite grows larger. The once innocent looking bobby soxer<BR>high-school girl has become \\"a young lady of very expensive tastes,\\" and naturally, Mildred caters to those tastes, even going so far as marrying a man she doesn't love in order to keep Veda in the lap of luxury. But that's not enough for Veda, who herself marries a boy she's not in love with, just to cash in on his fortune.<br />\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is an all around masterpiece: Ernest Haller's camerawork is classic 1940s noir, but with Jerry Wald's slick production, looks almost five years more modern than its later Warner's counterpart, Howard Hawks' \\"The Big Sleep\\" (1946) and looks forward to more great Wald noir with \\"Key Largo\\" and \\"Dark Passage.\\" The supporting cast is stellar, in particular Eve Arden as Ida, Mildred's wisecracking pal and mentor in the restaurant business, Zachary Scott plays Monty Beragon, Mildred's weaselly Latin playboy husband, Jack Carson is the hard-nosed Wally, her slick and slippery business partner and Moroni Olson (a veteran Warner's contract player) as thedetective who interrogates Mildred (a typical noir device, which sets the narrative for the movie, but with the twist that it's a woman telling the story, not the male detective, con, sap or sucker).<br />Max Steiner's score sobs, throbs and rumbles, with its sweet violin strains underscoring Mildred's sacrifice and humanity and plenty of foreboding low strings and brass a la Richard Wagner intoning the movie's tragic violence.<br />\\"Mildred Pierce\\" more than holds its own in the Cain trilogy and is a unique and first-rate movie. It will leave Joan Crawford fans on their feet cheering.
B000031WD9|4.0|I've seen this movie a countless amount of times and it is great.  It's about a group of four best friends all on a mission to lose their virginity before high school is over.  They all go through hilarious situations in the film and I laugh my ... off every time i see it.  It's not your average teen ... movie, it really is good.  If you haven't seen it yet, you're missing out.
B0000028M7|5.0|Of any band to come from Seattle, Alice In Chains were the darkest, deepest, heaviest, and influential of any grunge band.  By the time recording for this album started, vocalist Layne Staley had gone root-deep into a newly-started heroin addiction, and knew he made a mistake.  Aside from Them Bones, Rooster, and the classic Down In A Hole, the album is filled with references to Layne's heroin addiction.  \\"I have never felt such/frustration or lack of self control\\", sang Layne on the snaky, ominous title track.  And he meant it.<BR>Who would've thought though that ten years after this highly influential album was released, it would also sound prophetic, a prediction of the future as Layne would die of his addictions.  It makes guitarist Jerry Cantrell seem like a paulbearer, burying someone who was already sinking deeper and deeper into heroin and could not get out.  But no matter what way you see it, this album is a must have for anyone interested in what real grunge rock is about.
B00008S2VG|5.0|American Life the ALBUM and SINGLE are very cool, the amazing thing you notice right away is the words are way different from the radio versions. Which make buying her CD a much more better purchase and value. She say's things in American Life that a lot of people don't have the guts to say. This will be in the future an album of great importance due to the subject matter,  American life. It's amazing how much we see in American Life when we are not within it.
B000002HJR|5.0|Imagine the down-tuned, ... riffs of Black Sabbath, the Southern groove of the Lynyrd Skynyrd, and a mad man ranting about his inner turmoil.  Put the three together, and you have the genius of a ...show that is Down.  The band was started by Pantera vocalist Phillip Anselmo and Corrosion Of Conformity guitarist Pepper Keenan as a band that would concetrate more on slow, sludgy, laid back playing, rather than the fast, doulbe-timed attack of their respective bands.  The band would also include Kirk Windstein and Tood Strange of Crowbar on guitar and bass, and Jimmy Bower of Eyehategod on drums.<BR>     They were all New Orleans natives, all stoners to the end.  And those two factors laid the seeds for what is now probably the best Sabbath [imitation] album ever made, even better than the Sabbath [imitation] bands that influenced them, such as Trouble, Pentagram, and the Obsessed.  And for the first time on record, rather than singing(or screaming) themes of enpowerment in Pantera, Phil sang(or screamed) about his inner demons.  From his depression, to his alcoholism , to his heroin addiction, which started not long before NOLA was recorded.<BR>     This is one of those albums that are listenable from beginning to end.  Not one song here can be considered a filler.  From the opening screamer, Temptations Wings, to the stoner anthem, Hail The Leaf, to Stone The Crow, the albums only accessible track, to the dramatic closing of Bury Me In Smoke, this album is chock full of Sabbath on steroids, negativity soaked insanity.  Nola is a must have for any Pantera, C.O.C, Crowbar or Eyehategod fan.
B000000W5L|3.0|No slick production Exile OnMain Street hit the shops in 1972 and was hailed by critics as Their most mature and ambitious album to date. Recorded in Keith Richard basement in France and with his wonderful masterful guitar skills and amazing piano´s , horns and voice of Mick Jagger they created this album that has become one of the most loved album in rock n´roll history. <br />I must  confess I did not enjoy this album that much. The songs I Liked was Rocks Off, Rip This Joint, Shake Your Hips, Casino Boogie, Tumbling Dice, Sweet Virginia, Torn And Frayed, Happy, Let It Loose, Stop Breaking Down, Shine A Light and Soul Survivior. Though that is a lot. The album does not work as a whole. Though every song is well craftet, well played and thoughtful and the arrangements are good. It seems that they did this album way to fast. Even though supposed to be shoddy they should have worked more on the songwriting or instead release a single album.
B0000634EV|5.0|After a six year hiatus, the members of stoner metal side project Down finally found the time to record their follow-up to 1995's NOLA, which had over the years had become an underground classic.  The only differences here were the replacement of bassist Todd Strange by Pantera bassist Rex Brown, and their recording procedure.  The entire band decided that rather than go to a comfortable studio, they decided, along with producer Warren Reiker, to all move into the guest house on Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo's vast property deep in the Louisiana swamps.<BR>And if having six people living together under one roof wasn't crazy enough, they rented a whole truck load of instruments for a month, thus giving themselves only a month to record what would become their second release.  To top it off, the tripped out on weed, as well as perscription drugs just to bring in the hazy vibe of albums like Led Zeppelin III, and Black Sabbath's Sabotage.<BR>But if anything, it finally paid off.  On this record, they lived up their original mission of being stylistically diverse while still showing off their Sabbath influences.  And Phil Anselmo makes yet another landmark.  Where he speaks about his problems for the first time on the first Down record, he practically sings through the entire album for the first time on any record.  But not to worry, for he still sings about the same bleak themes of depression and addiction that make the first record a classic.<BR>Musically, this album has it all, blistering heavy metal, long, laid back jamming, a blues saranade, and Zeppelin-esque closer written entirely by Phil on acoustic guitar, featuring his wife on backing vocals.  There can be diversity in metal if it's done right.  And these guys know how to do it right.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Gone are the days when the White Stripes played humble blues-rock.  Elephant showcases a newfound swagger in the vocals and guitar riffs of Jack White.  The blues influences are still evident, but this album sounds much more like a Led Zepplin album than a Johny Cash or Cole Porter album. The stripes fourth album is another simple masterpiece held together by kickin' guitar riffs [reduced] down, vicious drumming.  It's a [great]record that any rock, blues or punk fan should buy.
B00006CXSS|4.0|The movie is the one of the most realistic war movie I have ever seen. Beeing an officer by myself I sense that the movie is based on a detailed description of the veterans. <br />There is only one thing I don´t like. The view of the Easy company is a very selective one. Obviously they were lucky and survived the war and they were on the winner side. The americans can sure be proud of their troops freeing Europe. WWII was started by Hitler and this was a horrible crime which did cost 50 Million people their lives. The Germans know that and are not very keen on going to war any more. We hate war today! But there are several things the western allies tend to forget:<br />The big and horrible fighters of the war about which the german veterans of WWII are talking about were the russians and surely not the americans. At the time of D-Day 750.000 German troops were fighting 1,5 million allied soldiers in normandy. 4,5 Million troops were fighting the russians at the eastern front at that time. 3,5 Million German soldiers died in whole WWII. German soldiers killed 11 Million russians soldiers in the most horrifing battles the world has every seen. The German soldiers always fought against an enemy who outnumberd them by far (except the little countries in the beginning) in soldiers and tanks. They could only perfom like that because of an huge fighting spirit, oustanding training, flexiblity and superior tactics. Please keep in mind how a country of 80 million people can fight against nearly the whole world (including the two later super powers) for 6 years! So think about the German soldiers fleeing in the movie BoB.<br />At the time d-day started our best soldiers were already killed in russia. The russians were killed and taken prisoners in the early 40ies in huge numbers (f.e.g. 1,5 million russian casulties and PoW in only one battle). But still they fought and fought and fought. Our veterans are so impressed by the russian people and are still talking about them with lots of respect. The russians are truely brave soldiers.<br />Compared to that nearly no one was a lot impressed by american fighting power. The only thing the old ones are talking about is about the superb american airforce. In average the german russia-vetrans who also fought in france in the end said: \\"Shoot at an US tank with your gun in despair (because you have nothing else to fight it with) then they stop and call for the airforce\\". No russian fighting spirit but very human for the american troops. The US had everything: A lot of tanks (weak sherman tanks but a lot of them), airpower, supply.... The germans at that time were the remains of an already by the russians defeated army. That they still fought with nearly nothing, beeing attacked by all directions ( form east, from west and from the south) while their families are beeing murdered by american phosphoros bombs and low flying fighter planes shooting at women and children after the bombing raids (which were war crimes nobody is talking about nowadays => Dresden)is possibly unique in history.<br />I am only writing about all this because americans tend to be so proud of themselves that they forget about truth and overall history. BoB is a very good and realistic movie of a lucky company who caught the enemy in surprise or in total defeat. But it is not a movie to show children in order to learn about WWII!!<br />Don´t get me wrong I am not anti-US. I am glad they were part of freeing us. I also hate the criminal nazis who terrorized the whole world and (not to forget) the germans themselves. <br />I am also glad the US is willing to go for dictators like Sadam Hussein. <br />But: War is not a game. War is not a TV-Reality-Show on CNN. War is no movie. War is not example for the US for beeing the only ones who suffer and who are brave.<br />If you interpret BoB like that. The world is not getting better.<br />So watch this good movie and use your brain!!
B00005JLSE|3.0|I may be biased, as I must admit I am no big fan of musicals. So, everybody who is into musicals, can easily add an extra star to this rating. I also feel that musical belongs to the stage, and like all other stage performances, it is not so easy to transfer into a film format. This hard task is rarely well accomplished, and to be honest, I do not see any big need of uniting the worlds so separate and different as stage (musical in particular) and cinema.<BR>Having said that, we must remember that making a good film of a musical IS POSSIBLE. \\"Cabaret\\" is maybe the finest and best known example. Reviewing \\"Chicago\\" we shall not avoid some references to this obvious classic.<BR>To rate a musical really high, it must be not only a good film, but also contain good songs.<BR>Let's start with the songs here and be frank. Come on, the songs here are mostly forgettable! Are there many songs that you really want to sing along during the film and weeks afterwards? Nope! Maybe the only really catchy song here is \\"If You Are Good To Mama\\", but the somehow wooden performance of Queen Latifah made it forgettable when I was watching the movie (especially that it was terribly boring to this point), and only weeks afterwards I realised the song was really catchy! Compare it with \\"Cabaret\\" and you'll know what I mean! Although not great, the songs weren't also bad, so we can afford 3 for the music here.<BR>If the songs were just so-so, was perhaps the film very good, with an entertaining plot or perhaps with deep inner or social sense? Again, no, no, no! After first half a hour I wanted to go out of the theater - I found the story so dumb and dull. A stupid lady killing her lover because he refused to make a star of her as he promised to do just to attract her. So typical, so cliched story that it's a waste of words even to describe it. But I stayed in the theater and things started to move faster, with another lady-murderer (Zeta Jones), clever but cynical lawyer (Gere), and a bunchof other, quite colourful characters. So, it started to be kinda funny, but never outstanding and really entertaining. I also find the story not so dumb overall. It pictured the totally cynical, amoral atmosphere of pre-war Chicago quite well. ( But the picture of papers and media brainwashing ordinary people is more timeless). Maybe I'd prefer a drama for this plot instead of farce, but it was OK.<BR>The characters were played OK. Zellweger was not very sexy, but played an angel-faced but totally depraved witch quite well. I also do not understand the criticisms of Zeta-Jones performance based on her well-rounded posture. First of all, she is really sexy. Personally, I am very fond of all these round shapes and many other men are! Come on, critics, are you really fans of all these thin anorectics? I do not believe. Also, I am very fond with Gere's performance. It was criticised here as being \\"wooden\\". But man, he played a lawyer - so should be a bit wooden! But his face was so cynical that made an almost archetypic lawyer. <BR>I could not stop laughing when I saw him and his small, clever eyes and he reminded me so much of all these too many lawyers I met in my life!<BR>So, I think \\"Chicago\\" is an OK. movie, but lightweight and instantly forgettable. I do not regret I saw it, but would rather not buy a DVD or watch it second time (but there were only a few movies I was eager to see more than one time). I have red an interview with Zellweger, where she compared this movie to a beautiful, excellent candy. I would rather compare it to a rather tasteless (although not bad) candy in a very colourful, beautiful paper. As it happens much too often, many people rated this product for the package, not for its inner quality. Even Oscar jury seemed to prefer the beautiful package over real thing. Nevertheless, it's an OK. product and you can see it if you have enough free time.
0385334176|4.0|Deadeye Dick is a novel only Kurt Vonnegut could have written - quirky, strange, thought-provoking, and a little bit depressing.  The story of Deadeye Dick and his family is not a happy one.  Rudy Waltz acquires his unusual nickname at the age of twelve by accidentally killing a woman in his hometown, but the whole story starts well before Rudy was even born.  His father was supposedly a promising artist, or at least his own mother thought so, but he and his painting tutor did little more than travel around getting drunk and carousing with women of ill repute; after the tutor was exposed as a sham, Otto Waltz went to Austria to study in the years before the Great War; his lack of talent forbade him entry to the Academy, and he developed a friendship with another failed artist who later became chancellor of the Third Reich.  This association with Hitler and some of his ideas would come back to haunt Otto in the 1940s.  Rudy was Otto's second son, and on the day when his father bestowed upon him the key to the gun room, Rudy took a rifle up to the top of the cupola at his family's most unusual residence, fired it randomly, and unknowingly shot a pregnant woman right between the eyes while she was vacuuming - thus did Rudy receive the nickname Deadeye Dick.  His father insisted on making a production about how everything was his fault, and life would never be the same again for the dysfunctional Waltz family.  They lost everything, and life got little better as Rudy matured.  The story of Deadeye Dick and his family goes on to include such events as a decapitation, a death by chimney (it was made of radioactive cement), and the eventual death of everyone in the whole town by way of an accidental neutron bomb explosion.  There is a lot of symbolism in the book, and Vonnegut's discussion of what certain symbols mean in the introduction is particularly helpful in understanding this novel (although I'm still a little unsure about the random inclusion of recipes throughout the story).  One experiences a definite lack of closure upon completing this fascinating read, and that inevitably disappoints some readers, including myself to some degree, but I don't think any can deny the fact that Deadeye Dick offers a typically Vonnegut-like interpretation of life and offers much food for thought to the serious reader.the story).

B00004SCX6|5.0|I thought Britney did a great job on her second album. The songs all sounded wonderful, and they were fun to listen too. Here is my rating of each song:<br />1. Oops...I Did It Again- Britney's first single from this album, I think this has neat lyrics and I love to dance and sing along to this song! It has a nice beat to it, and I love Britney's message. Grade- 10/10<br />2. Stronger- This song is like a sequel to \\"Baby One More Time\\". In this song, Britney's telling the same guy that \\"my loneliness ain't killing me no more\\". I love this song, it has such a strong feeling, and is also another good dance song. Grade-10/10<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' on My Door- A nice song, but I thought it was a little bit boring.

She made it sound awesome, and it's one of those songs that makes you wanna get up and do something. Grade- 10/10<br />5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- Not one of my favorite songs, this is more like a slow love ballad. Nice lyrics, though. Grade- 5/10<br />6.

When Your Eyes Say It- A nice song, but kind of boring. It's slow and I usually skip it. Grade- 4/10<br />12.

B00008DDXC|5.0|The 2-DVD set that you'll get when you buy this are well worth the money.  In this, the second movie in the Harry Potter series, you'll find all of the same loveable characters from the first moveir, and some new ones as well.  In this movie, Harry is a year older, and has more battles with Draco Malfoy, and then now has to save Hogwart's from the dreaded creature in the Chamber of Secrets.<br />The action scenes can be a little intense for younger viewers, but still will be timeless in its direction and pure enjoyment level.  The second disc contains 19 extra cut secenes, and interviews with the cast and author.<br />I highly enjoyed this movie, and look forward to seeing it again.

Dear Diary- Written by Britney herself, she says how she likes this boy but is too shy to tell him that. It wasn't ryming, just a nice song. Grade- 10/10<br />Overall, this CD would be a great buy. I think Britney's songs are great, and she has nice lyrics. This would not be a purchase you would regret.
0064471837|5.0|Sabriel is a delightful book that young people would enjoy because it has danger, love and happiness.  I give it five stars because it was an all together great book.  If you liked sabriel than try reading the second and third books in the outstanding series.
B00008DDRX|5.0|If anyone ever needed a reason to purchase a LARGE screen TV, this movie is it.  There are lots of movies that I would like to see on DVD and then there are the few that really should be on DVD, and this is one of them.  Don't sweat the minor critiques, just do yourself a favor and get it!  Two other movies that have great auto scenes are &quot;The Italian Job&quot; and &quot;Ronin.&quot;  Add 'em to your collection.  You won't regret it.  Aloha
0761536434|5.0|I'm not much on reading books, I usually like lots of pictures & this book doesn't have a lot of pictures. But I must say I LOVED this book!<BR>It was so fascinating that I couldn't put it down. It tells the story of Video games from the early days of Atari & Pong, up to the Play Station Era. It tells about the rise & fall of the game companies, programmers & the people who shaped the industry.<BR>If you are at all interested in video games, aren't we all, you must read this book.  It is a pretty big book, 624 pages & only about 10 pages of pictures. It is filled with cool facts, lots of history, & great stories about not only the games, but the people who brought them to life. All of the game systems & companies are talked about, I doubt the author left anyone out.<BR>I love the crazy stories of the Atari companies antics; they liked to hold board meetings in hot tubs & smoke unusual things in their factory. I love the conflicts between the companies; theft, industrial espionage,patent & copyright infringement:  I think everyone sued everyone else at some point in time.<BR>Most of all I really love the stories of people who believed in what they were doing & were ably to follow their dreams & make something special no matter what anyone else told them. And I love remembering the games. My favorites were: Tempest, Centipede, Donkey Kong, Ms. Pac Man, & the Atari 2600 Adventure. Those were the days.
B000060P79|5.0|This album has it all -- outstanding energy, clear talent, and a consistency across tracks that I wish other albums had.<br />For those who say that only young people would buy this album, I'm a 45-year-old who went to his first rock concert over 30 years ago :-)<br />Simple Plan has only produced one album, yet 11 of the 330 tracks on my &quot;very best stuff&quot; playlist are Simple Plan tracks.  This puts them in the same league as Boston and Phil Collins, and ahead of Green Day.  It amazes me to type that!<br />Finally, whatever you do, do NOT just listen to one or two Simple Plan cuts -- those playing on TRL and Leno :-) -- be sure to listen to every last one of them.<br />The Simple Plan cup is 90% full.  If they can create a second album of the same caliber as No Pads, No Helmets then this could become a mega-band ...or at least SHOULD become one.<br />Floyd<br />P.S. I had the good fortune to hear them live at a free concert in Vancouver last summer.  They were FANTASTIC -- sounding every bit as good as the studio stuff, they were INCREDIBLY loud ...of course, a wall of Marshall amps helped :-)
B00007G1ZC|5.0|I remember seeing this movie some 6 years ago on PBS (a cultural/educational channel stationed here in New York).Not knowing what I was really watching,and also catching the film in the middle,I thought it was kind of wierd,yet very intriuging. I wanted to find out more about this movie and the director behind it.<BR> At the time I didn't have a computer,so research was kind of limited or took lots of work(you know what I mean). So I left the issue alone and concentrated on other things. Then one year later,\\"DREAMS\\" came on PBS again, and I happily watched it from start to finish. I have to say, this one of the best films I have seen ever.(and I have seen a lot!) <BR> For one thing, This film \\"DREAMS\\" has opened my heart to foriegn-Japanese films and Japanese/Asian art as well. <BR> In this film, Akira Kurosawa showed stunning visual perception and artistic quality you don't see very often in U.S. films. It was one of those art films that allows you take a mental and emotional journey into the mind and life of Kurosawa. <BR> These are 8 beautifully,carefully shot and written stories that will move you in ways you never thought possible (only if you allow it to.)<BR>If you are ONLY into high-budget commercial American films that are only there to dull your brain and steal your money, then you might want to stay away from this powerful gem. But, I sincerely recommend anyone to give it a chance.<BR> You're getting deep stories with abundant amount of heart and soul. If you're an open-minded individual, you won't regret checking it out.<br />P.S.(If you love this movie then check out \\"RAISE THE RED LANTERN\\". It's not directed by Kurosawa, but it's also a powerful and thought-provoking Asian art film.)
B00006JIA4|2.0|This is okay, but doesn't have their '70s FM hits like \\"Spread Your Wings\\", \\"I'm In Love With My Car\\", \\"'39\\", \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" and \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", and unforgivably omits \\"Love Of My Life\\", \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", and \\"Get Down, Make Love\\".  Those songs are what made Queen famous, rather than afterthoughts like \\"Body Language\\" and \\"The Invisible Man\\" (included here).    It is ridiculous that so many key tracks are omitted on a 3-CD set.  None of the songs here are bad (Queen's worst is 10 times better than most bands' best), but these aren't the songs that gave Queen such a following.  Young fans won't fully \\"get it\\" with this compilation.  The wait for a comprehensive Queen package continues.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is going to be hard to top, it's absolutely incredible. Here's my thoughts to the bitter Radiohead fans-- Radiohead is an amazing band. They are one of a kind. That being said, don't you think that you should be happily impressed by Coldplay's adoration for Radiohead? They have chosen a great band to be inspired by, not replicate. Radiohead has been around for longer, so they've had more time to sell you themselves. Coldplay is newer on the scene, and have less recording for fans to chose from, but if you put their work up against Radioheads, they blow them out of the water. Radiohead has a static electricity sound that roughens a lot of their music. Whereas Coldplay creates the most beautiful compositions of our time. So suck it up, and let yourself admit that there can be someone out there better than your beloved Radiohead.
B00000K19E|2.0|At the base of this film is the simple concept that everything around us is a computerized hologram (aka The Matrix), masking a less-than-ideal real world.  It's an idea I too have thought would make a good movie, as I'm sure a lot of other people have.  It's not too difficult of a concept.<br />But the movie keeps explaining it.  And explaining it.  And explaining it.  Over and over.  Apparently they think the viewers are very very slow.  I was sitting in the theater thinking \\"Okay, I get it!  Move on!\\" and then they continued explaining it for about another hour.  Keanu Reeves plays someone is isn't very smart because it takes an hour to explain simple things to him.<br />And I guess it has good special effects.  But I'd think any movie that relies on special effects will soon appear dated, since anyone will be able to recreate them on home computers in several years.<br />To me, this movie seems like a good idea that didn't develop.
B00003CXE7|2.0|Boring, typical, overrated, uninspired Hollywood tripe.<br />Spectacular action sequences, decent cinematography and brilliant performance (by none other than Phoenix) marred by EXTREME lack of substance, and a truly hokey and predictable script. Scott's frantic direction can't save this utter waste of film. Not for a second. As far as I'm concerned, this movie just caters to the random and puerile 15 year old. Did anyone care about Maximus? I sure didn't. Robbie the Robot has more life and emotion than this guy! Crowe's performance is dull and destitute, and quite frankly, makes the whole project destitute with his dull and empty presence. He's like paper-mache up there. Yeah, I know Maximus' world takes a tragic turn for the worst, but COME ON! He's a paper-cut-out for the entire movie! Very annoying. What's worse is he actually got an Oscar for it. Yikes! Who knew wooden acting was awarded so shamelessly?<br />Yeah, I liked the hyper, ultra-violent action scenes. The movie had the potential to be a great action film. Thus the reason it gets 2 stars. Well, not the only reason... this abysmal failure of a movie has somewhat of another saving grace. Yep, Joaquin Phoenix's abrasive performance as the villain, Commodus. He's too good for this tedious mess. It's just too bad his brilliance can't correct the errors that litter the rest of this tedious insult.<br />In the end, Gladiator is completely void of any intelligence, originality, and soul. People bawled at the end. I didn't. How could I? I didn't feel for Maximus. He was a dry, sour and ridiculous character. He's extremely hollow. So is the script! I can't understand why so many people commend this...So many awards for such a weak little meaningless, forgettable movie.<br />So, in summation, this inferior pile of wretchedness is literally clubbed to death with more cliches than you can shake a stick at. And to tell you the truth, I laughed at the end. It's THAT [weak]. A movie that struggles for 2 hours to buildup this intense level of emotion and drama, and failing so miserably. Makes me chuckle.<br />Recycled piece of boring regurgitated Hollywood junk.

B00006LSM3|5.0|I am a Beatles fan.  And while for a short time I thought that Paul was my favorite, it eventually became clear that I hold an odd fondness for George Harrison in my soul.  There is something about his straight-forward, spiritual, sarcastic music style and the person he was that makes me love him.  <BR>I bought Brainwashed and listening to it presented me with a combination of feelings that you don't often experience.  I was filled with joy to hear George's distictive voice sing along with the songs he so lovingly composed.  But I could not help but cry as I realized what an amazing person we have lost.  <BR>This album is an experience like no other.  A bittersweet reminder of George, a fun musical accomplishment, and a lovely tribute from Dhani and Jeff Lynne.  It is filled with warm songs that will make you smile through your tears.  <BR>Standout tracks include \\"Brainwashed\\", \\"Any Road\\", \\"Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea\\" and \\"Stuck Inside a Cloud\\".  But the highlight (for me anyway) is \\"Pisces Fish\\".  I cannot help but choke up as George sings that beautiful melody.  <BR>This is one of the best albums in recent years and it should be purchased whether you like the Beatles or not.  I guarantee that it will lift your spirits.
0671042858|5.0|I read this book in 6th grade. I picked it up and said, &quot;I'll never be able to read this&quot; i was wrong I read it in 2 days. I hated reading until I read that book. He's so descriptive and the words run so smoothley. I highley reccomend this book to people from ages 12- 50
B00008PW3Q|4.0|This CD contains 18 songs, so removing 6 still leaves it with a respectable length (~50 mins).  By removing 2, 5, 6, 9, 15, 17 from the CD, you get a 4-star album.
B00008PW3Q|3.0|There are maybe 4 really good Mac songs on this album. The rest are some of Lindsay's mindless meandering songs that are just too excrutiating to listen to. Some of Stevie's songs are the same...no harmonies at all. This album really misses the creative and fun of Christine McVie.
B000059XUT|5.0|On a technical level, Toy Story was a pioneer. It is much more than an impressive piece of animation, however. Toy Story is an exquisitely crafted tale that deals simply, yet brilliantly, with deeply human themes. The toys of Andy's room are forced by circumstance to deal with all the complexities of love and friendship--jealousy, fear, forgiveness, rejection, acceptance--and they do so in a charming way that will warm the hearts of children and grown-ups alike. There is something authentic about cowboy doll, Woody, whose toy-child relationship with Andy becomes threatened when new kid on the block, Buzz Lightyear, suddenly replaces him as favourite. There is something down-to-earth and believable about the vulnerability we see in the characters, and something beautifully real about the way these issues become resolved. It is a tale that will strike a chord with any of us.<br />Of course, this is also a very funny and exciting movie that entertains and delights, though what really draws me in is how all this becomes an education for us, as we are brought face-to-face with what it means to be human. Toy Story effectively integrates first-class storytelling--storytelling as it should be, that speaks to us, and resonates with us as human beings--with breathtakingly riotous fun and adventure.
B00000IBVC|5.0|Though this may not be the best recording of Turandot ever released, it is arguably the best DVD of a live performance to date.  The crew lensed the performance with careful attention to dramatic detail -- we are taken from the grand sweep of authentic Chinese spectacle to almost claustrophobic close-ups of soloists, then back again, all timed with excrutiating precision to the soundtrack.  The widescreen presentation captures much of the grandeur of the original performance as I remember it (one of the few bonuses of my previous career was an ability to travel to events such as this) and the sound quality is superb.  Sergej Larin's Calaf is competently respectable and Barbara Frittoli stands among the great Pings on record.  The PCM Audio track is superb, though the enthusiast should be aware that it lacks some of the clarity of the audio CD on some of the larger numbers.  Although conductor Mehta's sometimes heavy hand is apparent in the pomp of the production, it is in the backstage photos (over 100) and the \\"Making of\\" vignette that we see his disarming charm work to bring together not only the cast and crew, but the many Chinese officials attached to the project.  This DVD is a genuine pleasure for any fan of live opera, and for the enthusiast, it beautifully records a unique moment in opera history when Italian composer Puccini's famed Turandot \\"came home\\" to China.  David R. Bannon, Ph.D.; author \\"Race Against Evil.\\"
0316666343|3.0|The beginning was very promising. A strong story with even stronger characters then a strong fizzle. What happened to George Harvey? For so long he was on the run and then he slips...I felt the author grew tired of the story and just quickly put a closing to it all. I would recommend this book to anyone in a book club. It will give something for everyone to discuss.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|no godsmack cd has come close to the overall sweetness of this cd. i listen to it 24/7 and ill never stop cause it owns

6305910340|5.0|I many ways this is a dreadfully dull film, and yet I remain captivated every time I watch it.  A film about a chess prodigy, by all rights, should be about as boring as watching paint dry.  But this character-driven story is so compelling and so affecting that it's an actual excitement that comes from watching it.  Joan Allen, Joe Mantega, Ben Kingsley, Laurence Fishburn are amazing.  And as much as I hate child actors, Max Pomeranc is about brilliant as a kid can be in any film.  I've forced many people to watch this movie over the last ten years, and every one of them has loved it.
B000002MUN|5.0|I bought this used yesterday. I am glad that I own it, but whoever would want to sell this must be out of their minds. This is a solo album by Petty, and it is, overall, more like his work with the Wilburys than the Heartbreakers.<BR>Wildflowers- an acoustic love ballad. One of the best on the album <BR>You Don't Know How It Feels- easy to see why it went to #1 and won a Grammy. Showcases Petty's musical talent with him one lead vocals (of course), acoustic and electric guitar, bass, and harmonica.  <BR>Time To Move On- great up-beat Dylan-styled song.  <BR>You Wreck Me- first song that is really in the style of Petty's earlier hits good song  <BR>It's Good To Be King- Another awesome song. This one hit number 2 and is possibly the best on album. <BR>Only A Broken Heart- This is a great song about Petty's divorce.        <BR>Honey Bee- This is like a mix of CCR and the Stones.        <BR>Don't Fade On Me- this is acoustic country-blues at it's best. Tom on acoustic gutitar and vocals, with Mike Cambell on acoustic guitar.        <BR>Hard On Me- Kind of in-between soft rock and hard rock. Great song.        <BR>Cabin Down Below- I love this song it is either rockabilly or blues-rock. I haven't figured out which.        <BR>To Find A Friend- Best on album. Ringo Starr on drums.        <BR>A Higher Place- Showcases Tom's abilities as a songwriter.        <BR>House In The Woods- 2nd best. This is rock at its finest.        <BR>Crawling Back To You- A great love song.        <BR>Wake Up Time- Just listen to the words.<BR>This is a very good album and probably Petty's best after The Last DJ and Southern Accennts. This and John Mellencamp's Dance Naked are the best of 1994.
B000088E6D|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see Michael Buble at the Cinegrill in the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in April '03 and must say I haven't been this excited over a male singer since Frank Sinatra. Even though Buble has been compared to Sinatra, the undisputable King of the Saloon singers, Buble held his own in his own style and had most of the women in the audience swooning, including myself. (He's now 27 years old)<br />The CD starts out with \\"Fever\\", Peggy Lee's most definitive song, and Buble sizzles. His rendition of \\"Moondance\\" pops and the version of \\"That's All\\" is pure romance. I just hope that he gets the attention he surely deserves and the critics give him a break and stop comparing him to Frank Sinatra. There's only one of those. When I can listen to a CD/Album over and over and enjoy it more each time as I do Frank Sinatra and now Michael Buble then I know that this is a winner.<BR> <BR>I thoroughly enjoyed the CD and am looking forward to more of this new and very talented singer.
B00008S2VH|5.0|It is critics' job to pick on Madonna and rip her material to pieces. It is audience's job to ignore the critics and make decisions by listening to her music and judge it independently.<BR>I was immediately captured by this album. It did not happen with Grammy-winning Ray Of Light which took some time to grow on me.<BR>Enough bad was said about the title track. I wouldn't say it is my favourite track here, it sounds a bit cold to me, but again she is not expressing any warm feelings in it. It comes more complete with the infamous but brilliant video (which I am sure everyone saw on the Internet) where she offers great presence and a great deal of controversy. You get to like the song more as you watch it, because it is hard to disagree with it. She had her reasons (personal and commercial) to pull it, but she did manage to make the intended point.<BR>My favourite song on the album is Intervention, a beautiful and touching ode which I would sing in a heartbeat in karaoke to someone I love. Whether it is devoted to her husband or son, it is a great way to express feelings for a very special person.<BR>I believe many tracks on this album will become disco anthems after being remixed, and they still sound wonderful in present arrangements.<BR>The lyrics are often simple, but all songs have very personal meaning and explore her whole worldview. She doesn't ask anyone to agree with her, but she is honest, and it separates mainstream artist Madonna from many other mainstream chart-toppers.<BR>I recommend this disc to everyone who wants to hear something different. I had no expectations from the album but ended up with a very special treat from a very special artist.
B00004Y6RO|5.0|This is the greatest metal album to come out in years...the only album that comes close to it is Iowa..which is by SlipKnot also. The Digipack which is SlipKnots 99'Debut which is also the year Corey Taylor(Vocalist) and Jim Root(Guitars) entered the line-up. But back to the Digipack..this album rules. With songs like Eeyore, (Sic), No Life, Spit It Out..this album blows your head off...I listen to this album everyday when I get home from school..cuz it relieves the tension and frustration from my day...Slipknot are masters of their genre and pure geniouses...and anyone who disagrees can die in a pile of their own herpes-infested waste....But buy this album..and Iowa..your sure to be pleased..unless you like pop and hip-hop then your gonna be like wtf? and still get your head blown off...
B00005Y1UX|4.0|This was a well-made movie, and I enjoyed it, but I have to say...from the time that Robert Redford comes onto the screen and makes his infamous proposal, Demi Moore and Woody Harrelson's characters don't spend much time mulling it over. I think this film raises questions that may be tough for some to answer, as in \\"Would I ever let my husband/wife sleep with anyone for ANY amount of money whatsoever?\\" My answer is simply: OF COURSE NOT. You'd have to be pretty dumb, desperate, and morally corrupt to even consider it. I can see now why this film was so controversial when it was released. It was a good movie, though, and it portrays the consequences that those certain kinds of decisions can bring. The leads were very good in their roles. I was not disappointed. The score by John Barry was excellent, as was the direction by Adrian Lyne. <br />Oh, the only problem was the way in which that million dollars is finally spent. It's ridiculous. You just HAVE to see it! Made me laugh...Other than that, Recommended!
B00001OH7O|5.0|I mean, I never heard this album, but, well, it's gotta be good, I mean, Bowie. Gotta geddit. Someday...
B00005QW5X|4.0|An employee at work recommended that I watch this, so I brought it home and watched it. I wasn't disappointed. It was different, but it was good. The songs were great! It reminded me of \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\", but it was better, I thought. The performances were very good, especially that of John Cameron Mitchell, who is also the film's director, as well as the creator of the play on which the film is based. There were a few sexual scenes that I felt were not necessary, but other than that, I thought it was a pretty good film!
B00006690G|1.0|Eminem used to be good back when he made the slim shady L.P wich was a really funny album with hilarious lyrics and no-one took his words seriously  and killed someone just because he says something about somebody killing someone like the foolish, stupid critics seem to think, for example say slim shady l.p made [dollar amount] worldwide eminem show would have made [dollar amount] worldwide because of the critics because they were on his back all the time bitching about some little ... words that mean nothing so then eminem makes marshal mathers l.p and half of it is similar to his slim shady l.p but the other half is all [griping] about critics and gets on your nerves quick, if eminem wanted to [gripe] about the critics he should have gone on some T.V show but instead he ruined half his album and now everyone knows about him and listens  to him so the critics have dug themselves a huge ... hole that they'll never be able to get out of, and about the eminem show it simply [is weak] besides without me its ... cleaning out my closet is easily the worst song in the history of music and my dads gone crazy is also a terrible song and soldier a repeditive piece ...
B00000JQFM|5.0|What can I say other than &quot;amazing&quot;? This was Satriani's big breakthrough record, and it's easy to see why. Not only does Joe show outstanding musicianship, his compositional skills are top notch. Like you'd expect from a &quot;guitar god&quot;, it's full of riffs, but it's also full of *hooks*. All of the tracks are individual and memorable, and you may find yourself humming them.<br />&quot;Surfing With the Alien&quot; and &quot;Satch Boogie&quot; are the big hits everyone points to, but my personal favorite is &quot;Circles&quot;, which I think really shows Satriani's understanding of dynamics and of tension and release. Intense stuff.
6305313687|2.0|I do honestly believe the bigotry of all forms is taught at home.  I do like this movie for pointing out that racism can be taught at home.  It was good to see the race issue from whites.  They feel blacks and minorites are destroying their country and leeching off the system, while blacks feel they are profiled a lot.  I liked this movie more, but feel as I have seen the double standards and hypocrises by the PC crowd, that they are anti-white, anti-European and distracting attention off real issue facing America today.<br />What I don't like is the intellectual dishonesty by the PC crowd who paint everyone preaching personal responsibility as 'bigots'.  It irritates me that the liberals didn't make a movie showing racism from the black leaders.  Louis Farrakhan, Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton who simply make a living telling young blacks males that 'whitey is keeping you down' creates the same hatred and intolerance against whites that the Neo-Nazis were creating against blacks.  The difference between a redneck putting on white sheets and a Black Racist is that the former has no resources and support to put his beliefs into action, yet the latter does.  <br />Skinheads and KKK members are the VERY least of black's problems today.  How about the fact that many black communities are plagued with illegitamate births, AIDS, crime, poverty, even in cities like Chicago, Detroit where there are black mayors?  <br />If you think about it, this movie may just make whites hate blacks and minorities even more.  As long as there is affirmative action, black leaders blaming all whites for their problems of blacks, Martin Luther King's dream will be nothing more than that...a dream.
B0000062GK|4.0|Make no mistake, I thik this album is a fantastic listen. Joe's chops are as fine as they've ever been, and it'd make a good introduction to Satch for new listeners.<br />However, if you've already heard Surfing With the Alien and The Extremist, Crystal Planet doesn't have many more musical ideas to offer. It's more of the same (of course, when \\"the same\\" is those two great albums, it's hard to say that's a bad thing!). And the tunes just aren't as memorable this time around. I can hum Surfing or Flying in a Blue Dream or Always With Me, Always With You, but I'd be hard pressed to recall a tune from this album if asked.<br />Still, new listeners and dedicated Satch fans alike will find a lot to like about this album.
630469797X|5.0|Can i just say that DAWN OF THE DEAD is a true work of art.<BR>The storyline, the action, and everything else works better then i ever expected in a horror film, the atmosphere is astounding and the zombies do excellent in this fine piece of work from and can i say 'a true master' GEORGE A ROMERO. <BR>I would like him and would think thousands of other fans like him to do more 'zombie' flicks but in different situations.<BR>Im not going to spoil this GREAT horror because you must buy it to be believed, your money will be worth spent!
B00000JCOV|5.0|Ok, every true slipknot fan out there knows that this album  is not their debut! I just wanted to make that clear for  all the new faces that are finding out about slipknot andwant to pretend they know this band and say &quot;what an awsome debut&quot; making them look like they knew slipknot since the start!Any-ways,i remenber when slipknot's selftitle album their second album first came on stores and how it made alot of people that  loves a difirent type of nu-metal  very happy.Slipknot still a great band  and their third album &quot;iowa&quot; sounds very good but it doesn't  have the great sound as their debut or   their selftitle one!Over-all ? great album and the best songs here are &quot;eyeless&quot; , &quot;sic&quot; , &quot;surfacing&quot; , and, &quot;spit it out&quot; i mean slipknot is the only type of nu-metal that should be apreciated! laters!!
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble has the best voice I've heard in ages!  What a dreamboat!!!

B00008H2LB|5.0|The new Meteora CD by Linkin Park is with no doubt the best CD they have made. Every track is as good as the last and does not compare with their previous albums. If you are a Linkin Park fan, this CD is a must have. On the CD are also special featuers such as the Somewhere I Belong music vidio. Buy the CD and you wont go wrong!!
0316096199|5.0|This book evokes so many things:  acute awareness of your own essential vulnerability, a frustration that must have been shared by her family when the author sinks into self-destructive behavior, an up-close look at the horror of rape, an honest appraisal of just how long it took to reach a degree of equilibrium and healing and so much more.<br />As someone who has worked with rape victims, I thought that she was indeed \\"lucky\\" though it is hopelessly crass and somewhat cop-like that it was pointed out to her.  I've taken care of so many rape victims who were never heard in court because they were \\"imperfect victims\\"--not virginal, not as beat up, not sober.  But ultimately her \\"luck\\" was not sufficient to save her from this horrific experience and horrific it was, by any standards.  I was horrified by the rapists psychological victimization both at the time of the rape and subsequently.  I have no doubt that many victims I worked with experienced this but didn't mention it to me.<br />...P>The last part of the books does have a \\"sometime, much later...she gets well\\" feeling to it.  The author who was willing to give us this close up view of her assault withholds the story of her therapeutic work of her learning to feel, learning to deal with her PTSD.  But that was, indeed, her perogative.  Though I admit to a curiousity about that aspect of her story, I respect her right to not tell that story now or in the future.  It's a nice moment of regaining and showing control over what Sebold will let us know and see about herself, an important step in dealing with an event that leaves the victim totally out of control.<br />This is an important book and I would recommend it freely.
B000002LMK|4.0|to \\"A music fan from Littleton, CO USA\\":<BR>I believe we are suppose to write a review for the material presented on the album, not our personal opinion of the artist as a \\"human being\\". And if mr. young does have to step on/over a few of his friends (which is very debatable) in order to create his art, then so be it. To us, the fans, neil young is here to entertain. I could not care less about what he does in his personal life. So keep whatever neil-hating propaganda you have to yourself and let the rest of us enjoy the beauty that is NEIL.<br />no damn-near-60 year old man rocks like neil... hell, NOBODY rocks like neil! long live the king! ...and don't do drugs.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I've always been a Madonna fan, but I have to say I think this may be her best work yet--either that or I've just been dance-track deprived!  All tracks are either a 4 or 5 star, but I especially like track #7/Intervention  It will definately be the one CD I always pull out when I want to dance or go for a jog--makes me want to run and run and run.  This chick rocks!  A must-have for any Madonna fan, or for anyone who loves to get up and move in spiritual body kind of way.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Essentially two solo albums interlaced with each other (and wrapped with the Mac's famous long running rhythm section), Say You Will has a bit more edge than the previous releases by the &quot;classic&quot; line up of the band. While Buckingham's songs play to both his strengths (melodic songcraft) and weaknesses (over reaching neurotic material), Nicks' occasional over the top dreaminess is reined in by Buckingham's participation. In fact, her material benefits the best in this &quot;reunion&quot;. While Buckingham's material takes the most risks (and the best tracks of his that succeed are those that skirt the edge of the Mac sound), Nicks' material acts as a comfort food for fans of the classic Mac sound.<br />Christine McVie is sorely missed. Her warm ballads and voice balanced out the extremes represented by Buckingham &amp; Nicks. While she does appear as a musician on a couple of tracks, her songwriting and bluesy vocal touches are prominent by their absence. It was probably wise not to recruit someone else to replace her given the delicate chemistry within the band. As the last two Mac releases proved, that chemistry was magical when they were at the top of their game.<br />The overall feel of Say You Will falls somewhere between that of Tusk and the polished pop of Tango In The Night. The production (particularly on Buckingham's solo material that was grafted onto this project)is missing the softer polite feel of lesser efforts (Mirage). Buckingham's playing is very animated as if he is trying to make up for the gap in the band's sound without Christine. While Nicks' mystical feel and sound are intact, there's an urgency here that was missing from the lesser material she penned for the last two original albums with Buckingham &amp; McVie.<br />Overall, it's clear that the band has entered a new phase. Without the fine balance of McVie's cultivated keyboard playing and rich, warm voice, the band has found a sound that harks back to their best efforts without replicating it. It's certainly not the best effort the band has produced but, then again, it's not quite fair to compare it to Fleetwood Mac, Rumours or Tusk as this really isn't the same band. It's also clear that the time away from each other since The Dance has helped both songwriters to enrich their trademark sounds with touches missing from previous Mac gatherings.<br />Although not all fans will appreciate Say You Will, those who won't purchase it will be missing out on a fine, well made album. Those folks that disliked later day Mac because of its great success will also be missing out an an album that takes a number of risks. Ultimately, those risks pay off for the most part with a rich, interesting album from these vets.t replicating it.

B00008DDSC|5.0|This movie is absolutely perfect for entertainment on a first or second date with someone you've only recently met and developed attraction for.  Prepare a nice home-cooked meal, dim the lights, find a comfortable sofa, and watch this film together.  It is a delightful romantic-comedy romp exploring the hilarious dynamics that often erupt between lovers when they first discover one another and decide to pursue a relationship.  It's also a fun film to consider over the Christmas holidays, when you visit your parents and everyone in the family wants to stay inside and watch a movie together.  Ice down some sodas, make some bowls of popcorn, gather all the kids in the den and watch this whale of a movie together -- it will become a repeat seasonal favorite, one to which you return year after year, just like \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\"  Enjoy !!
0812550706|4.0|My 8 year old son picked this book up and read it in about 4 days, he was totally engrossed.  I usually try to pre-read books before he does to make sure they are OK for his maturity level (since he is a very good reader), but I didn't screen this one first.  After he finished it and liked it so much, I did read it.  I don't read science fiction, but I quite enjoyed this book.  In fact, I read it in two days!  <br />However, as I read it I decided I probably shouldn't have allowed him to read this book quite yet.  There is profanity throughout (not tons, but often enough), nudity ... crudity (rude words/actions all around), and plenty of violence and gruesome images.  So I'll sum this review up like this:  The book is exciting, appealing to many ages, but be careful with younger kids because it is pretty intense and mature!
B000089RVX|2.0|...which is called Lacuna Coil. I've been a fan of Lacuna Coil for a couple of years now. I found out about Evanescense from someone on LC mailing list. When I heard Evanescense, first thing that struck me is that it's very similar to LC. Still, LC is a better band. Cristina puts more feeling into her singing, and the musuc itself is heavier and richer.<br />To summarize, Evanescense sounds like a watered-down version of Lacuna Coil, adapted for general audience and more radio friednly.<br />Seriously folks, check out Lacuna Coil (either Comalies or Unleashed Memories album), and you will thank me later.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|This movie has a lot of bearing on current and future events, particularly in the middle east. As mentioned previously, its a real shame this film didn't get the exposure it deserved when it came out in the theaters. If it had it would have been interesting to see the extent to which it would have gotten slammed for being \\"sympathetic to terrorists\\" or some other such smear.<br />In anycase, as for the movie itself, it is an extremely compelling film to watch from its start til end. Very well made as well. I've heard people compare this to \\"Black Hawk Down\\" in its \\"gritty realism\\" etc. Personally I think such a comparison is probably not well made, although superficially there may be some similarity in filming techniques (use of handhelds, etc.). <br />This is just a really well-made and chilling movie to watch. The special features are very informative as well, including an interview with the real Ivan Cooper (the main character in the movie) and a mini documentary on the making of the film, which reveals how most of the actors were not trained, an many of them were community members from Derry itself who had lived through the events or the legacy of the event of Bloody Sunday. This includes a commentary by an eyewitness who was 15 at the time of the actual massacre. The director also used former British soldiers as well to portray the ones in the movie.<br />This is a must-see film, at least in terms of its artistic value. The degree to which it \\"accurately\\" portrays events is a debate that, like in a lot of movies with so called \\"political messages\\", won't go away. But in the sense of its story-telling value, it is essential to see this perspective - an unpopular one in this country at least given recent events. At its core it asks the question: when you're bringing armored vehicles and armed troops into occupied territories and shooting at civilians, perhaps its time to rethink debates about \\"the roots of terrorism.\\" See it now.
B00005JKN9|3.0|I am a huge Scorcese fan and I was looking forward to this film for a long time. I saw it on openning day and I was very disappointed. The directing, soundtrack, cinematography, and Daniel Day Lewis' performance were spectacular and it is worth watching for those qualities but overall the film was mediocre.<BR>What I didn't like...<BR>1. The story builds up with the premise that Amsterdam (Leonard DiCaprio) will avenge his father's death but turns into a semi-documentary. If I wanted know about the history of New York I'll watch the History channel. When I go to see a Scorcese film I want to see mob violence.<br />2. Miramax's influence shines through. There is only one short trademark bloody Scorcese scene and even that may be edited out of the home version. Leonardo DiCaprio and Cammeron Diaz? Directors just don't have the control over production that they once did.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Previously, U2's \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\"<BR>and Coldplay's \\"A Rush of Blood To The Head\\" were <BR>the premier rock/pop albums of the new decade. Add<BR>\\"Say You Will\\" to that list. <br />The gems (w/ album track no.)...<br />1. \\"What's The World Coming To\\" a great opener and a<BR>solid pop song w/ a sense of humor: \\"Everyone's gone<BR>to the moon\\". <BR>4. \\"Thrown Down\\" starts with classic Buckingham guitar<BR>guided by solid McVie bass. Stevie Nicks delivers a gem.<BR>She's the best story-teller in the business.<BR>6. \\"Red Rover\\" is one of my favorite songs from this album. <BR>Buckingham has a smattering of Jeff Lynne, Brian Wilson,<BR>and Lennon/McCartney in his musical make-up. Most songs <BR>on this album show that. \\"Red Rover\\" is a classic Fleetwood <BR>Mac song. I'm not sure but I think I hear Christine McVie<BR>singing part of the back-vocals.<BR>7. \\"Say You Will\\" Stevie Nicks shines on this album. Her<BR>best work since the early 1980's solo efforts. This tune is a<BR>30-week run adult contemporary hit. <BR>8. \\"Peacekeeper\\" is the first radio song from the album and <BR>tells us right off that shiny happy Christine McVie popsongs <BR>won't feed the radio waves over the next year. This tune is<BR>radio friendly but intense enough that you have to think about<BR>whether you like it or not. <BR>12. \\"Silver Girl\\" is another Stevie Nicks gem. <BR>13. \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\" is the best song on the album.<BR>I've played this song 50 times in the week I've owned the CD.<BR>14. \\"Bleed To Love Her\\" was heard during Fleetwood Mac's <BR>last album, \\"The Dance\\". A terrific tune, but like many <BR>songs on this album, hearing it live will bring this song <BR>to the stratosphere where it belongs.<BR>15. \\"Everybody Finds Out\\" has some great Buckingham guitar.<BR>I like the lyric: \\"We see no change in sight, watching her<BR>decline\\". Stevie Nicks delivers again.<BR>17. \\"Say Goodbye\\" may be my favorite Buckingham tune. It just<BR>has that edge to it, a serious attitude: \\"You said goodbye to me,<BR>now I say good bye to you\\". <br />In my view, these 10 songs add up to Fleetwood Mac's best<BR>record. But, as with all great (challenging) albums the reviews<BR>will be mostly excellent w/ occasional poor thrown in. If every-<BR>one agreed that this was a 5-star album it wouldn't be half the<BR>fun. Sure, we miss Christine on this one. But we're reminded<BR>that without Buckingham and Nicks, Fleetwood Mac would be stuck<BR>back in 1969.<br />I can't wait to see these tunes live.
0151008116|4.0|This is a very uneven read. The early parts of the book are fascinating, especially in their insight into the family dynamic that Pi faces. If the rest of the novel had matched the parts describing life at the zoo, his brother's interaction with him, and his dabbling at a variety of religions, then the life of Pi could have been much more powerful.<br />Unfortunately, the better known part of the novel, Pi's stay adrift a lifeboat in the Pacific with Richard Parker, a Bengal tiger, is slow and relatively uninteresting. One must slug through this section of the novel. Looking through the reader reviews, some must not have found it this way, but for me, the lack of action of any kind mirrors the hopelessness Pi must feel at his own plight.<br />The ending redeems much of this, and the character of Pi is well drawn throughout the novel. Again I am at a loss to understand the Mann Booker Prize being awarded to a seriously flawed novel when an excellent book like Fingersmith by Sarah Waters is passed over. If you are looking for a riveting read, go for Fingersmith ... its 500 pages go much faster than Life of Pi.
B000099T3P|5.0|I have been a fan of the Critters Movies, since I was a little Boy.  I remember being about three years old and sitting on my fathers lap, watching these Movies.  I was really scared.  Now I watch them and I'm not that scared, there just very good campy fun.  And there is little to no gore, and maybe 3 Adult Terms, through the hole film.<br />The first film, \\"Critters,\\" starts out with a young farm boy, who is very interested in Comics and Sci-Fi.  After a little bit, he witnesses what he thinks is a metor crash, but when him and his father go investigating it turns out to be a space-ship.  Them him and his family, start to be attacted by little alien hair-balls.

0385504209|5.0|had given up hope.  thought all mysteries had turned into &quot;cozies&quot;.  Great research, good characters and takes more than an hour to read.  Also recommend &quot;Shutter Island&quot;.  Two in one week, incredible!!
B00003CX9E|1.0|This film is nothing but pure hype. If the film is not good enough to claim the title of the greatest film ever made,  it should not be claimed that title. It's ridiculous to choose this film over many other great films to hold the title of the best American film. Citizen Kane is not for those who truly love great movies. It's very disappointing.
B000002L99|5.0|This is obviously the first VH album featuring Sammy Hagar as lead singer. It was noticably different from all previous albums. Most attribute this jarring shift in the bands sound to Sammy, but it really wwasn't his doing. Listen again--it's actually Eddie that changed so drastically. There are only 9 songs; 3 are synth-driven. Of the remaining 6, only 2 are heavy guitar songs, and even those aren't the heavy-handed style we've come to adore Ed for so much.<br />Ed obviously made a decision to depart from his signature sound for the sake of branching out, I suppose. But it's poor Sammy that gets blamed for it.<br />Overall, 5150 is a fantastic album, and contrary to what another reviewer wrote, it has aged beautifully. \\"Love Walks In,\\" \\"Dreams,\\" \\"5150,\\" \\"Summer Nights,\\" \\"Best of Both...\\" And the list goes on. In and of itself, it's a wonderful album, a classic. But when held up to the Dave-era standard, it will never satisfy the die-hard old VH fan.
B00006WUWP|3.0|I mean, I love Mike Myers and all, but this movie wasn't what I expected. There were great settings, but I didn't really like the plot.  The jokes were o.k. and I guess the ending and the beginning  was interesting. But I guess there was something that just wasn't right.
B000002U6E|5.0|CD arrived quickly, plays perfectly in good condition. Thanks,
B00000IQCA|5.0|This is one of my favourite films.<br />Many of the critics of this movie missed the point. This movie is not about plot or characters. Robert Altman does what movies are for; he takes us to another place.<br />What Altman does is give us a vivid impression of the incestuous whirl of the fashion world. His world is populated by both real designers (as ever spotting them is half the fun). and wonderful performances such as Richard E. Grant as a male Vivienne Westwood.<br />The movie also effectively transports us to Paris. And yes, Paris really is covered in &quot;Dog Poop&quot; (they were Paris jokes, not Poop jokes).<br />I think that many of the jokes about Paris, may have gone over the heads of US movie critics who have not set foot outside LA and New York.<br />One of the reviews of this movie described the fashion shows as &quot;pointless&quot;. They were pointless in the same way a Monet is pointless; they were in the movie because they are beautiful.<br />To summarise, if you love Paris and you love fashion, you will love this. The closing credits of a montage of Issey Miyake and other fashion shows set to Grace Jones' &quot;La Vie En Rose&quot; is worth the price of admission alone.
B00008NRI8|5.0|Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are two of the most charming and amusing actors working today. These same characteristics resonate through their movie, Two Weeks Notice. A throw back to the screwball comedies of the 1930's and 1940's, Two Weeks Notice is so much better than most of the movies being passed off today as romantic comedies. There is some very witty and intelligent banter between the characters. Effort is made by the writer/director Marc Lawrence to make the viewer understand why George (Grant) has never lived up to his potential and why Lucy (Bullock) the overachiever, still falls short in the eyes of her mother. As with any opposites attracts movie, the two are destined to collide and bring out the best in each other. This is not a groundbreaking movie, but in this day and age when movies seem to be increasingly reliant on special effects, it is a pleasure to be entertained by a movie that is instead carried by the chemistry between its two leads.<br />The DVD version of Two Weeks Notice gives the viewer the opportunity to get a glimpse of the affection shared by Bullock, Grant, and Lawrence for each other and the fun they had making the movie. Much like the commentary Bullock and Lawrence did for Miss Congeniality, the Two Weeks Notice commentary, although not particularily insightful about the making of the movie, does offer a peek at how funny and engaging these individuals are in real life. The Two Bleeps Notice feature that can be enabled while watching the movie is wonderful as it allows the viewer to see some hilarious outtakes in the context of their placement in the movie. The DVD also contains a HBO Making Of promotional piece, the theatrical trailer, and two deleted scenes, one of which is the alternate ending (wedding). This may not be a movie and DVD for everyone. But, if you like romantic comedies or are a fan of either actor, you will find yourself enjoying the pleasure of their delightful company.

Margot Kidder is just annoying and I was so glad when she was killed.

B000069HK2|4.0|This cd is indescribable not because its completely amazing, but because it has one of the most diverse collection of songs I have ever heard within a cd of 12 songs.  Some of these songs are so horrible, they're either way overdone on screaming (yes I understand this is screamo but come on) and either not sung well or half done on lyrics or tunes.  (ie. Say Days Ago, Poetic Tragedy, Greener With the Scenery, Pieces Mended). But on the other hand, some songs are just so incredible I can't explain. Songs like: the taste of ink, noise and kisses, buried myself alive, blue and yellow, on my own - would probably all be on my top 10 list of all-time favorite songs.  No jokes.  The taste of ink is the first song I heard by these guys.  Extremely catchy stuff.  After that I had to download the whole album. Blue and yellow has a mind-blowing tune thats just plain amazing, you just have to listen to it.  Download any of these 4 if you want a preview of this band. The few bad songs on this cd are the ONLY reason i wouldn't give this one 6 stars out of 5. I recommend this for anyone. Just avoid the bad stuff.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I was watching TV one day and had NO idea that I was gonna end up expanding my, all ready too large, CD collection.  I am a huge fan of mellow, rainy day, quality time with yourself music and this CD is great for that.  Norah has a husky alto that I love, she may not have a Mariah Carey range but you can't hold that against her.  She is capable of music that doesn't make your ears bleed.  Low key. With songs like \\"Don't Know Why\\", \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\", \\"Painter Song\\", and \\"The Long Day is Over\\" she can't go wrong.  For all those people that thought it was a waste of their hard earned money should listen to it again when they want to relax.  This album is not meant to get out of your seat and ready to party.  This album is meant for quiet reflection and relaxation, it is meant to inspire.  This album makes me want to write my poetry with music on instead of in the silence of an empty apartment.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This cd, in my oppinion, is the best one they've done. Faceless is a must have for any Godsmack fans.
B000089RVX|5.0|The first time I ever heard this group, I'm not kidding, I thought that Linkin Park's new album had a chick on it!!  This is exactly like Linkin Park - but probably even more original and better, which is saying a lot!!  These are inspirational musicians who seem to really get into the spirit of what they are creating.<br />I wish them a lot of luck in the future, and hope they continue to make tapes and records!!<br />HOPE YA' BUY IT!!
B00004RJ74|1.0|This movie has intense violence, brutality, vulgarity, and is simply awful. Tarantino is a sick man and belongs in a  mental institution.
020530902X|5.0|This little book has served tens of thousands of writers over the course of its amazingly long life, and it shows no signs of diminishing in importance. Perhaps its greatest virtue is its concise, no-wasted-words approach to writing, and it definitely practices what it preaches. It should be on the desk of every student and would-be writer.
B00006IU73|5.0|Wow..<br />In Absentia by Porcupine Tree may just be the finest album to come along in a long, long time. Trying to describe this album in terms of sound is difficult--think of a band with the vocal harmonies of early REM, the atmospherics of Pink Floyd or Radiohead, and the metallic sound of 70's era King Crimson or Tool. And yet, it sounds totally different from any of them.<br />Steven Wilson lends a hushed, subtle tone to the vocals that belies the very dark lyrics of In Absentia. The album is supposedly about a child that grows up into a serial killer, although the concept is somewhat vague. Wilson comments on society quite a bit--take The Sound Of Muzak, for example, which targets the state of today's music and how dehumanized and sterile it is becoming, complete with quite a catchy chorus.<br />The instrumentals are truly awe-inspiring. Supposedly this is Porcupine Tree's heaviest album, drawing on Wilson's collaboration with the Swedish metal band Opeth (which is how I heard about Porcupine Tree, in fact). The music alternates between delicate, soft textures and harmonies to heavy, complex riffs without feeling the least bit forced. The band is equally at home playing beautiful ballads (Collapse The Light Into Earth, Trains) as it is playing crunchy metal (Wedding Nails, The Creator Had A Mastertape).<br />As far as the album itself is concerned...well, you have to hear it to believe it. I've heard precious few songs that are as deeply affecting as Collapse The Light Into Earth, and Strip The Soul and Gravity Eyelids are two of the best songs I've heard this year. If you aren't excited after listening to the opening riffs of Blackest Eyes, check your pulse.<br />In a world of commercial garbage, we desperately need more bands like this. In Absentia is HIGHLY recommended to all listeners.<br />Note: Be warned that the enhanced video version can behave a bit wonky on some PCs. The video for Strip The Soul is indeed nice, but if it was left off or placed on a separate CD that would've been better. No big deal, though.on a separate CD that would've been better. No big deal, though.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This is one of the hottest young bands on the planet, and &quot;Meteora&quot; may just be one of the greatest records ever created.  The reason I believe this is because &quot;Meteora&quot; is going absolutely ballistic on the charts.  That's how you know if a band is good, if they are doing well on the charts.  Charts don't lie, dudes.  The chemistry and musicianship of Linkin Park defies odds - and belief!  Another reason I like this band is because they don't take themselves too seriously, they just sort of &quot;go with the flow&quot; like Queens of the Stone Age, a MUCH inferior band.  I saw Linkin Park in concert once and it was an incredible experience, certainly better than Pearl Jam and STP.  I wish all bands had a good screamer like this one does.  I like the tradeoff between screaming lyrics and the street-smart lyrics of the other dude.  It melds well with my serene sense of suburbia.<br />The Park ROCKS!!  They're tearin' up the charts!!<br />SEE YA' LATER!!
0060537639|1.0|To answer the query of the review which asks, is this book a reliable history? No. This is not a work of history. It is fiction.  This is a 'what if' narrative. <BR>As a professor of Chinese history, I cringe now thinking about the time that I will have to take during class, time that could be used teaching about Chinese history and civilization, to disabuse students who have heard about this caper. <BR>My opinion: Mr. Menzies is sincere. He seems perfectly intelligent and decent. However, there is no evidence that Chinese were in North America during the early 15th century. The conclusions reached in this book are the product of the imagination. This is not my 'opinion.' The 'evidence' presented is bizarrely not credible. Fantasy. But the publishers knew what they were doing when they signed the deal, the book is selling. <br />The more interesting story, which some scholars are telling, is this: that the technology which explorers such as Christopher Columbus used to reach the 'new world' was borrowed from China. A few examples of Chinese technology that found its way into Portuguese and other ships: 1. fixed rudder; 2. multiple masts; 3. compass; 4. cannon; 5. gunpowder; 6. airtight bulkheads. <br />Perhaps the most significant part of this project is this: Mr. Menzies stated that he was surprised to meet two professors in China who were making the same argument. This idea, that China 'discovered America', reflects a new nationalism in China. (but is not an idea that is popular among professors in China).<br />On the other hand, as someone who cares deeply about China's history and about US-China understanding, perhaps this book will stimulate an interest among people to learn more about China. So, maybe all this will have a happy ending
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I have been a Fleetwood Mac fan since Peter Green was the guitarist. My favorite projects have been Rumours (of course), Tusk, Fleetwood Mac, Mirage, The Dance, Tango in The Night. That said I was skeptical of Say You Will, esp since Christine McVie, my favorite member and I believe the balance of the band, decided that she no longer wished to perform. I had read that Syevie commented that Christine is very happy with her life in England and that she just does not have the desire any more to go on the road; Chris wanted the band to carry on, but just felt that part of her life was over and wanted the remaining members to produce a classic. Lindsey, Stevie, John and Mick are excellent in their own right but it was Christine that I felt was the steadying influence. I was sure that this would be a project like Behind the Mask. I WAS SOOOO WRONG!!<br />Say You Will may be the best project put out by Fleetwood Mac since Rumours. In fact, dare I say it, Say You Will may at least equal Rumours!<br />My favorite songs ... well actually I love them all, which is something I have not been able to say about any Mac project, except The Dance and Greatest Hits. What's The World Coming To, Miranda and Bleed To Love Her, from The Dance CD, are vintage Lindsey Buckingham. Thrown Down, Goodbye Baby, Silver Girl, Illume and Destiny Rules show you that Stevie has lost nothing as a team player. Say You Will, PeaceKeeper and Smile At You are getting a lot of air play and rightly so - they sound like vintage Mac compositions. Mac does take chances though with Murrow Turning Over In His Grave and and a hard rock, Come, which I hated at first and now find the more I listen the more I enjoy. <br />Do yourself a favor .. buy this CD. If you don't have Rumours, buy it as well and listen to them together. I think you will agree that they are 2 of the best pieces of musical entertainment out there.

B00008S2VG|1.0|Being a HUGE Madonna fan ever since Like A Virgin, I have to say this album really ....!! It's her worst one yet! I bought this CD expecting to be really surprised by the innovativeness, breathtaking beats, and wonderfully composed music that Madonna CDs usually contain (Especially her Ray of Light CD--my favorite!!). Instead, I was very disappointed by her childish and simplistic lyrics throughout the album (reminiscient of Avril Lavigne--who is about 20 years younger and doesn't have her own record label). I was also disappointed by the pace of this CD. Madonna needs to make up her mind whether or not she wants to make a dance (techno) song or a ballad, and she should not try to combine the two, which leads to a very awkward mixture of 80s tecno pop garbage. The only thing positive about this CD is that she is trying to show her political awareness, but this is also overshadowed by her references to lattes and materialistic views of Hollywood. The absolutely worst part of this CD is when Madonna suddenly feels the urge to rap (especially on American Life), trying to imitate Debra Harry, but instead sounding very reminiscent of Weird Al in Amish Paradise (I almost died from lauging so hard at her attempt)!! Please, I beg anyone who loved Madonna in the past for her creativeness to avoid this CD at all costs!! You will thank me for this!!
B00006ALGL|5.0|&quot;O&quot; traces the visage of love with revealing honesty and poetic mastery. Rice's whispery voice is sensitive, sincere and evocative. The tracks &quot;Cold Water&quot; and &quot;Cheers Darlin'&quot; are by far my favorites.
B00005YU1O|3.0|\\"Waking Life\\" is not quite an experimental film, though that's where its heart is.  Essentially a low-budget Richard Linklater film given a digital animation makeover, \\"Life\\" takes on metaphysics, dream interpretation, Joseph Campbell, film criticism, and I'm sure several other grad school subjects as well.  It steadfastly refuses to adhere to the \\"show it, don't tell it \\" theory of screenwriting, so much so that \\"My Dinner With Andre\\" begins to look like a Jerry Bruckheimer project in comparison.  The rotoscoped animation (they actually filmed actors live and traced them frame by frame) is a mixture of styles, with some shots being intentionally primitive, and some achieving a very eerie, stylized realism.  Often it is quite gorgeous too look at, but sometimes there's a brownian shifting of backgrounds and figures within the frame that can be rather jarring (maybe it comes from rotoscoping hand-held camera work, but sometimes it happens in what appear to be static scenes, suggesting that it is an animator's choice).<br />So, to recommend it?  That's a hard question.  I did enjoy it, and I think I will discover interesting things that I didn't catch in initial viewings, but I have a feeling that the audience for this film is extremely limited.  It's not even a good taste/bad taste issue-I think as many serious art film fans will find this as tedious as the mainstream crowd.  It does tend to meander around without a true center, but there are occasions, such as late in the film, when the main character tries to change his dream, that are really well written and even (almost) dramatic.  I'd say if you like Linklater's other films, you should have a good time with this.  Likewise, if you are predisposed to enjoy lofty discussions with friends this might be for you.  It's bargain-basement cheap for a DVD, so it won't set you back too much, and it has some nice extras  (comentaries, shorts, and a demonstration of the digital rotoscoping process, for the curious).  If youinsist on strong plots and active characters, though, consider yourself warned.
B0000797IO|2.0|I don't get it.  What's all the buzz really about?  That Jennifer Aniston can play something other than her &quot;Friends&quot; role? Cmon!  Aniston plays Justine, a depressed check out girl at a small town retail store who longs for something more.  She meets Holden, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, a much younger, new employee and has an affair with him.  The skinny: he falls in love, becomes obsessed, gets her pregnant,  robs the retail store and then......I won't blow the ending.  Did I mention she was married to John C Reilly? Anyway, she tells him the baby is his and they live happily ever after in Normalsville.  The story drags, though there is a very suspenseful pivotal moment for her (at a stoplight), but overall the film falls flat.  Good Girl is nothing to run out to so save your pennies for the DVD rental.  **1/2
B00005JLH3|4.0|If you're looking for a summary of the movie then you're reading the wrong review.  I'm just going to give my straight out opinion of this movie.  As a band director I know first hand about marching and drill instruction.  This movie did a phenominal job of showing the complexity of marching and field shows.  My only beef with the film was a few technicalities here and there, but then again it's just hollywood.  Some of the techniques and basics are off in the movie, but hollywood of course has to make it look good for it's crowd.  If you're into band, or field shows, or percussion, or if you just like great beats and something cool to watch this is the movie for you.  I graduated in college with a percussion degree and I'm giving this movie two thumbs up.  Check it out today, you won't be dissapointed.

B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke is a movie for anyone. It is not restricted to fans of anime, but to those intelligent enough to appreciate such a great story. It represents everything that is great about anime. It leaves out the senseless sex and violence that plagues many anime films and give anime a bad reputation to those who don't know any better. Fans of Ninja Scroll might very well be bored by this film but the truth is they're not looking for an insightful story. No, they're looking for an endless amount of gore that looks 'cool' according to them. <br />Princess Mononoke does have its fare share of violence but it's rather tame in comparison to some other anime. True, it does include some decapitating scenes but they aren't without reason. Considering the character's cursed arm is turning him into a demon, the options for showcasing that terrifying power are quite slim, especially when the bow his the weapon of choice. If the arrow was to wound the enemy just as it normally would, then it would prove nothing in terms of the character becoming a demon. It is also important to note that these killings are not glorified in any way, they're brief, and to the point. There's no need for pools of blood and guts.<br />The dubbing in this movie isn't spectacular but you should never expect it to be, in my opinion. If you watch a dubbed movie expecting to be blown away then you're already putting too much emphasis on it. Some people have a real hard time with dubbed films and in some cases I agree, it gets in your head and to tell your self not to think about it is to think about it. You know dubbing's done right when you never have to pay any piece of mind to it and that's why Princess Mononoke works for me. Some people are arrogantly sold on the belief that subtitles are the only way to translate movies. They will watch any dubbed anime and pick out every flaw they can find, which in turn ruins the experience. I pity these people.<br />The visuals are no doubt spectacular, there's no room for debate, you will be impressed. The story backs up the animation perfectly. A person familiar with eastern philosophy/culture will likely have an easier time picking up on subtle things but to be honest, this movie is not very complicated. Any westerner should have no problem with it, so long as they pay good attention.<br />If there's one complaint I agree with to some extent is the lack of character development. You probably won't find yourself caring to much about the characters. The thing is, Princess Mononoke is beyond individuals, and to develop some characters even more would be wasted time in a movie that's already long. You will learn all you need to know. The main character is a man away from his normal surroundings, trying to find truth. He has a short time to live, no time to waste revealing his own quirks which define him. But he is human after all, so we do get to see small glimpses of his personality at times. As for the main heroine, one could argue that she has too much personality considering that she's brought up by wolves. The side characters have a good deal of personality which is great.<br />Now some people have a problem with the ending. It appears to be rather static but gained knowledge and wisdom should not be underestimated. It is a fine ending to an amazing movie. Anyone open to fantasy should love this film.
B00005QW5X|5.0|The fabled rock star, Hedwig (hence, the wig-wearing lead character)  played remarkably by writer-director John Cameron Mitchell, is rocket-blasted through this off-broadway musical turned film.  With most of the rock performances being played and filmed live, the energy packs a wallop of rock 'n roll punch akin to Meatloaf meets Bowie meets Sweet, etc, etc.  Surprisingly enough, the music is really good!  With songs that tell the tale's past and motivate the characters through the story,  I found myself humming tunes after the film's ending and 'toe-tapping' all through it.  With a great supporting cast of 'characters', we find our downtrodden rock star muddling through the salad bars of america performing all the hits that an ex-flame stole (and consequently performs nightly in whatever 'arena' atmosphere is nearby).  Trying to get her name recognized for hits, she stalks ex-beau, Tommy Gnosis to catch a glimmer of the fame his has with her songs.  Of course the 'her' in this story was actually a 'him' from East Berlin.  Through a botched sex-change operation, (hence the title of the film) he has a confusing past of angry and bitter memories to conquer before finding his true self and a 'piece' (pardon the pun) of personal fame.  With amazing glam-era songs and fun, (sometimes very funny) lively musical numbers, Hedwig is a real hit.
B00005NWM3|1.0|Not only are all these songs the same in sound and subject matter, but they lack any sense of musical or narrative taste.  Do these guys practice at all or just head to the studio to record something that can be easily exploited?  I could teach someone who never picked up a guitar the opening track in 4 minutes.  No, I take that back.  It would take longer than that to teach someone to play this badly. They would have to unlearn anything and everything musical that they had picked up since kindergarten.  These bozos can't even make noise properly.  Nothing like haphazard palm-muted guitar sweeps to open an album. And the lyrics are beyond moronic. You may have to earn the title Pops or Dad, but you're a \\"Father\\" as soon as your sperm hits the egg.  \\"Kicking your ... would be a pleasure\\"? Go do it then if you're so upset and spare the rest of us.  Just goes to show that these guys are all talk and not much more.  And this is just the first track I've been on about. Hey, if you like your music to sould like street cats going at it, more power to ya.  Buy it up.  I must thank you dearly for keeping all the decent music out there from being overplayed.  This style of music has much more to offer than this exhibits.  Leave this album to itself.
B00005JKCH|3.0|Well, I helped contribute to the millions this film is making by seeing it Twice!  Oh well, it is a fun film and everyone I know wants to see it so......Tobey Maguire is great, as usual, as is Willem Dafoe.  Even though I'm a huge Kirsten Dunst fan, I thought her performance was a little weak.  Her lines seemed to forced and ingenuine. David Koepp's screenplay was also weak in the dialogue department.  Pretty corny stuff, even for a 'comic book' style film.  The film's animation effects, at times, are so blantantly noticeable, I feel that I am literally watching a cartoon.  But overall, it is a fun story and it was entertaining to watch Maguire's discovery of who he has become as it unfolds. *** 1/2 stars
B000002TQV|5.0|This album was in my regular listening pile for over 2 years. It is in my mind one of the best albums of all time. I remember hearing \\"fake Plastic Trees\\" for the first time. It came on right after the emergency broadcast system put out a tornado warning. THis song went great with the black sky and fear of iminent destruction. It's almost hipnotic. \\"Planet Tilex\\",\\" The Bends\\", \\"High and dry\\", \\" street spirit\\" as well as \\"Fake Plastic Tress\\" are very strong songs. I recommend this album to everyone. I still can't believe the band went from this to Kid A and Amnesiac.
B00003CXXM|3.0|Starring Matt Damon (Good Will Hunting) Franke Potente (Run, Lola Run!) and directed by Doug Liman (Swingers, Go), this action thriller, based on the Robert Ludlum novel,  is a remake of a made-for-tv movie starring Richard Chamberlain.  I haven't seen the telefilm yet, but I can't imagine it being better than this 'modern' version.  The film has weaknesses though.  Although the story moves right along with all the brevity and ferociousness of an action thriller, I can't help feel like it's all phony sometimes.  The little nuances that make a solid thriller move effortlessly and in a believeable way, like Sum of All Fears or Crimson Tide or even a Bond film, seems to be missing here.  An example was a scene where a foe of Bourne's decides he can't kill him and throws himself out a window in such a way that the audience explodes in laughter.  But this was not a 'funny' scene and that made me uncomfortable with the rest of the film.  Liman should stick to comedies and gen 'xer films.  He does them quite well.  ***1/2 stars.
B00006FR47|5.0|Chicago V, released in 1972, remained the band's most successful album until Chicago 17, when that recording, with it's barrage of power pop hits went on to become their biggets seller after it's release in 1984.  The success of Chicago V can be attributed, in large part, to the strength of the hit single &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot;.  This is truly a signature Chicago pop composition in every sense with Robert Lamm belting out the lead vocal with his warm timbre, the Chicago horns playing in classic style and great harmony vocal and rhythym section arrangements. This song stands as one of the all-time great pop music recordings and still sounds fresh today coming over the radio due to it's incomparable melody, timeless style and lean n' clean  production value.<BR>Unfortunately, because of the magnitude of the popularity of &quot;Saturday in the Park&quot;, Chicago V is sometimes referred to as the point where Chicago tuned &quot;pop&quot;, &quot;soft&quot; or &quot;sold out&quot;.<br />Fortuntely, none of this is true.  This album finds the legendary band presenting some of their most focused writing and most avante-garde approach to the compositions and arrangements as found on any Chicago release.<BR>The album's opening cut, &quot;A Hit By Varese&quot; is an energetic uptempo offering in 6/8 time. The horn section members trade solos and really stretch into some great dissonant territory. The rhythym section of Terry Kath on guitar, Peter Cetera on bass, Robert Lamm on keyboards and Danny Seraphine on drums are clearly at their best as a unit on this tune and throughout the entire CD.   Every track on the album finds each of these great musicians exploring the boundaries of their instruments, effortlessly jamming through every arrangement.<BR>As with every Chicago recording, Danny Seraphine just explodes with his drum parts.  Arguably the best musician in the band, Chicago V stands as a definitive showcase of Danny's cutting edge chops and unique rock-jazz style.<BR>Other great tunes such as &quot;While the City Sleeps&quot; and &quot;State of the Union&quot; remain as some of Chicago's most exploratory work.  &quot;Dialogue Parts I &amp; II&quot;, the album's other single release,  is simply terrific with Terry Kath's bluesy baritone and Peter Cetera's crisp tenor trading the lead vocal in Robert Lamm's classic, and perhaps best, political statement song. <BR>The the band is very experimental on this album while maintaining the qualities that made up the Chicago &quot;sound&quot; for years: great lead and harmony vocals, interesting, powerful and tuneful horn arrangements by James Pankow, and strong melodic songwriting. <BR>Chicago V is one of the best Chicago recordings, with the band finding great focus in their work and ability to blend their avante-garde inclinations and popular music styles.<BR>An exciting listening experience and just a  great CD.
B00006IUL7|3.0|The new film from Christopher Nolan (Memento, The Following), Insomnia is a tight suspense crime drama.  Al Pacino is a star cop from the city investigating a murder in Alaska in which Robin Williams plays the sadistic killer. Pacino discovers Williams identity early on, but quite a turn of events happens.  Williams blackmails Pacino after seeing his character make a very costly mistake of accidently killing his estranged partner.  The film's storyline is fueled by this plot device and is engaging to watch.  Although, there is no definitive directing style as in Memento, Nolan pulls off making a very fine and intelligent movie.  ***1/2 stars.  Check it out.
B000002UB3|5.0|This album is, I must admit, kind of patchy. \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\" for instance, is pretty rubbish. But side 2 of this album is utter genius, hence the 5 stars! A medley of 6 or 7 song fragments merge together to form a 20 minute sequence of inspired acid-fried pop, distilled to its purest essence. This is the Beatles at their most playful and creative. If your favourite Beatles track is \\"love me do\\", this is probably not your bag. If your favourtie Beatles track is \\"Me And My Monkey\\" or \\"She Said, She Said \\", this might well yank your chain, with great force
B00006JDVV|3.0|Well, Matthew McConaghey is definitely a bad ... in this one.....I didn't think he could pull it off at first but I think it worked well.  Reign of Fire is a solid action-fantasy film.  What it lacks in story development and dialogue it makes up for in action and imagery.  Similar to the Alien films, it deals with a disgusting monster who ravages humans until their extinction.  Think if the 'Aliens' had gotten to earth.....that's kinda the storyline here.  Another bright spot is Christian Bale, of course, as the now 'grown up kid' who first discovered the 'main' dragon deep within a mine shaft.  Although the story could use a beefed up script (James Cameron could've helped) the film survives as a fun entertaining romp in the not so distant earthly future.  ***1/2 stars (out of five). Check it out!
B000001F3C|5.0|The 3rd best album of All time.  It must be in everyones cd collection by law.
B00003CX9Q|5.0|The 1982 box office champ is back and better than ever!  Steven Spielberg has added scenes and polished effects to make for a more entertaining film than it already is.  A few 'new' sequences especially the 'bathtub scene' is an instant classic.  Although, parts of the film by today's standards seem a little dated, but it holds up well.  Then  again what can you expect from a legendary film that has been talked about, watched, critiqued and parodied for twenty years, right?  Check it out for nostalgia's sake and plain old curiosity.  I will definitely wait for this version on DVD. ***** Stars.
B000003TAW|5.0|this album is really good. i really loved it. it was one of the first few albums that i bought when i first started listening to rock, and this was always in my cd player. now that my cd collection has expanded to nearly 300....weezer is still almost always in my CD player.  It is an amazing CD, every song is good, and i never skip over any of them.  Each song has good lyrics, and is so full that it is crazy.  The guys really know how to do their thang...and their thang is definetly music. The CD is so good with lyrics and music, and the fact that all of the songs are amazing! A must have!!
B00005JL78|4.0|Spielberg has finally redeemed himself.  Although, not as brilliant as Jaws, Jurassic Park, Empire of the Sun etc, this film manages to have all the right elements for a great summer blockbuster.  The film stars Tom Cruise as the head of a 'Pre Crime\\" unit that arrests criminals before they commit the crime.  Things (of course) turn around on him as he is now becomes the hunted.  Filmed with a special bleach process, the unique look of the film is washed out of most colors and at times is very bright and 'blown out'.  It is a great look.....comparing the rich, dark, look of Blade Runner or the bright, colorful look of The Fifth Element.  With global warming and the ozone 'thing'  who knows...maybe this is a more accurate look at Earth's future (ha ha).  Anyway, a fine film and an entertaining suspense thriller. Take note of fine performances by Colin Farrell and Max Von Sydow.  **** stars. Definitely check it out!
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer was the sole reason why I starting listening to folk, and rock, and soft rock... his songs are amazing, very good beats, and very good lyrics. He is very heartfelt with his music, and he does a good job presenting it. I listen to his CD everyday over and over again. Don't be fooled by his singles that came out, there are other songs on the CD that are amazing, and are very good!! I wopuld definetly buy the CD even if you dont like folk/rock/whatever.... because i know people who like rap and bought this CD.... it's one for everyone, the whole family to enjoy! It's amazing! You won't regret it!
B00006HBUA|1.0|Run as fast as you can from this one.  Wow, what an opening line, right?  Sorry, but this film gives new meaning to 'having my intelligence insulted'.  Compared to other teen flicks of the day, this is a 'dumbing down' version of the Scooby Doo cartoon series (believe it or not).  For some reason it is doing well at the box office as though the general viewing public wasn't very saavy on fine filmmaking and intelligent writing.  Hmm (That was sarcasm by the way). The only bright spots are the dead-on performances of the 'animated' Scooby and Scrappy Doo and Matthew Lillard's portrayal of Shaggy.  (Did I just say &quot;portrayal of Shaggy? Jeez...) With the plethora of fine films released every week, it is a shame to waste your time and money on such mindless dribble. If you have a six year old he will probably love it and you will be bored witless. *1/2 stars. Avoid if possible.
0312932081|5.0|This is, if you have never read any military or sci fi books before (and if you have) THE BOOK to read. It is not only exciting and thoughtprovoking, but also poignant and easy to understand. Ender's Game is one of those classic rarely found books that combines higher level thinking concepts and simple wordings that make this book great for reader's of all ages. A fair warning to first time scifi readers, all scifi books you read after this one will NOT live up to its standards. Now read the book!
6305897786|2.0|Does this film deserve a write up?  Well, okay, no.  But, I love Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski so here it is: the cinematography is beautiful, as usual.  But the story line and the acting at times, was weak.  Please tell me why directors cast their wives when they clearly cannot act?  Wait, scratch that, I already know the answer.  Anyway, not worth the rental unless you are aiken to the likes of a bad mixture of &quot;Seventh Sign meets The Exorcist meets The Prophecy&quot;.  I'm glad I didn't pay full tilt at the theatres!
B00008S2VG|4.0|The thing I love about Madonna is that even when she's at her worse she's still better than 99% of the other stuff thats out there. And another thing, before I get started I wanted to say...buy it for X-Static Process alone! This is one of the most organic and stripped down (not to mention simply divine!) songs Madonna has put out.<BR>Moving on, I have been a HUGE fan for years, and I know very well what this woman is capable of, so I always expect top-knotch from her. A unfair thing to say, I know. The only thing that disappointed me with American Life was that this was the first time (in a long time) I can remember that Madonna really didn't try anything new, you didn't get the edgy tracks you got like Impressive Instant and Sky Fits Heaven from her last two albums, not to say these are pop contempories by any means...far from that, minus \\"Hollywood\\"(and the other two singles AL and DAD) I can't really imagine any of these songs reciveing much radio play, and thats a damn shame. <BR>American Life is the stuff Madonna briefly experimented with on 2000's Music, sounding more along the lines of Don't Tell Me,I Deserve It,and Gone, but better...faster..strooonger! Love Profusion and Nothing Fails are already classics, and not to leave out X-Static Process...my favorite ;) Oh and just on a side note in case you didn't like the first single the rest of the album sounds nothing like it and the only loser here would be I'm So Stupid.....the rest of the album is stellar.
B00006RU5B|4.0|But what can you expect from the Rage Power and the Soundgarden brain? This CD is more heavily influenced by the latter, but the former's skill and style show up quite a few times throughout. Almost all the songs on the album are great, a couple are somewhat lacking, but these are very few. This excellent effort is kind of like a Soundgarden that is not so depressing, and with less musical &quot;fat&quot;. Anyway, everyone should give this awesome album a listen.
B00007AJGH|5.0|I like this movie because it's.......Well it's not like just any other movie. I must say they did a wonderful job of making this DVD, and I like all the special features like the standard/wide screens versions and the trivia questions, and the surround sounds is just out of this world. If you like movies and cartoons combo, you will love this.
B000067CPX|4.0|This may not be Funk-Rock or Hard-Rock, but it sure is good. This is, in fact, a really good CD. Most of the songs are mellow rock, with a few experimental flourishes. It's got plenty of big hits and beautiful moments throughout. While I do like Claifornication better, I must say this is one of the Pepper's best efforts, and people who like sungs like &quot;Under the Bridge&quot;, &quot;Otherside&quot;, and &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; would very likely enjoy this as much as I.
0060090367|3.0|I can't tell anyone that this is the best books I have ever read because it is not. But it is good, to the point of being hard to put down. <BR>Claire Webster, has just had a baby and found out in the same day that her husband has been having an affair with a downstairs neighbor. So, James (the husband) is leaving her and the newborn to run off with the mistress. Claire makes a mad dash for Dublin to live with her crazy family. She, finally after not showering for sometime, gets herself back together and goes out into the world to find a handsome classmate of her younger sister. <BR>After reading this book I have put some faith into more of Marian Keyes books. This may not be the best but it is the first.
B00005B36H|5.0|One of the best albums of all time, if not THE best album ever (well, let's say post-70's). Such a wonderful array of Progressive Rock by this increadible group of talented musicians deserves 5-stars and more. This record is everything: Reflective, Dark, Moody, Cerebral, Deep, and Heavy. And it doesn't miss light passages either. Very complete album indeed. From the turbulent opening of The Grudge to the last static freakness of Faaip de Oaid, all in between is over 70 minutes of Prog-Metal goodness. After the awesome Grudge (10/10) enters \\"The Patient\\" (9.5) that uses very light vocals and instruments at various points. Afterwards is the single \\"Schism\\" (9), which has a very memorable bass-riff and drums. The Parabol/a (10) 2-track song is my favorite in the album and overall. Ticks and Leeches (8.5) is the hard-rocking song, Maynard actually lost his voice for a week after recording the song. The awesome title track follows, with a boggling time-signature and great vocal choruses. Disposition, Reflection and Triad were originally going to be a 22-minute epic, but were separated into 3 tracks, all filled with some awesome percussion and huge instrumental passages. THE most Prog song I've heard in a while. If you like the Classic Prog such as Yes, King Crimson & ELP, AND also like Heavy Metal, you should love this.
0064400018|4.0|This is the first book in the amazing Little House series written by Laura Ingalls Wilder.<br />These books act as a biography and historical record of a pioneer family, the Ingalls.  Laura is the 2nd daughter of Charles and Caroline Ingalls.  In this particular book we meet up with the Ingalls family living in the big woods of Wisconsin.  Charles is a farmer, a hunter, a trapper and adventurer.  Caroline takes care of the family and runs the household.  Laura and Mary are two young girls living in a log cabin in the big, dark woods.<br />The most charming aspect of this book is that we see pioneer life through the eyes of a young child.  It is interesting to note that Laura Ingalls Wilder did not start writing until she was in her 60's but she still tells this story in a very child like way.  This is not to say the books are not well written, they certainly are.  But the writing gets increasingly better as the series contiues.  I'm not sure if this was by design or not...  of course the stories are told by a much older narrator as the story continues.  This would definitely lend itself to better narration.<br />  These books are excellent reads for children in 3rd grade and up.  They are written in a nice, simple style, yet they are just challenging enough to keep kids thinking.<br />I have also found that younger children, especially in 2nd grade love to hear these stories as read alouds.  If you want your child to learn about life long ago these books are a great stepping stone.<br />This first volume in the series concludes with Pa Ingalls moving on with his family to the great west.  It seems the big woods were getting smaller as more people moved in, and Charles got the itch to move on.  The Ingalls family heads out on a wonderful adventure to the wide open environment of the prairie.<br />If you read it, you will find it hard not to want to read the rest of the story and continue the series.  It's hard not to love these sweet family oriented tales.
B000002WPI|5.0|Wu-Tang Clan made the best album ever.I'm a huge fan of the Wu-Tang,I have all of their albums but I think \\"Enter The Wu-Tang\\"is the best of them.\\"Enter the Wu-Tang\\"has some of the memorable beats of the whole hip-hop industry.My favorite songs are:C.R.E.A.M.,Method Man,Protect Ya Neck and Wu-Tang Clan ain't Nottin Ta F' wit.For those who don't have this album I want to say:\\"GET IT AS FAST AS YOU CAN!\\"  Long live the WU!!!

B00005RHGK|5.0|Jeepers Creepers is an old-fashioned spooker that owes as much to Steven Spielberg's Duel as it does to Tobe Hopper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre. When the film's terrifying Mr. Creepers starts shedding his skin, the film is compromised by cheeky climax best appreciated by fans of camp. Trish and Darryl are the poster children for the Curiosity Killed the Cat generation. They head back into Creepers territory once they've successfully dodged his road rage. Director Victor Salva keeps the excitement going despite fumbling with the been-there-done-that self-reflective humor. Surely, the film's rest-stop set piece must count as one of the more impressive moments of the year. Mr. Creepers plays tongue-hockey with a police officer's severed head. In the background: a sign celebrating the deliciousness of meat. Even at its most puerile, Jeepers Creepers has bite: Eileen Brennan is a hoot as the crazy cat lady, surpassed only by Patricia Belcher's eccentric psychic. The film has been tailor-made for the Fangoria crowd--not only is Mr. Creepers fond of sucking face but check out his human-mach&eacute; Sistine Chapel. The anger, brutality and strange eroticism of the film's final confrontation between Darryl and Creepers suggest that a real-life bogeyman was working behind the camera.
B00005JLXC|4.0|Firstly, I am not a marvel movie or comic book fan but this movie was better then all the other marvel movies exept x-men.  While some of the action scenes look good they are in all honesty comletly mindless.  The main up is that Dare Devil is not affraid to kill during this film.  This could show the director of spider-man what to do in it's upcoming sequal. <br /> I gave this movie four stars because it has raised the bar for all other marvel comic to movie productions that will take place.  In overall Bullseye steels the show in his goth kind clothing and Dare Devil spits out his teath.  FILM CUTTING WAS THE MAIN DOWNFALL AND STOPPED IT FROM BIENG A CLASSIC
B00004Z4WQ|1.0|How funny is a rome-aphrodite gym teacher delivering lines like \\"Never belive someone when they tell you that shaving your pubic hair will rid you of crab infestation.\\"? Well, that's just one of the ways SCARY MOVIE is flawed. In it's favor, there IS laughter to be found here. There's a clever scene that make's fun of I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER when a guy is hit by a car and immediately recovers, and while the kids debate about how best to deal with the situation, the guy is trying to walk off and tell them he's fine. There's also the bit in the beginning where Carmen Electra's breast implant gets yanked out. And I absolutely loved the scene with the (gay)boy and (not gay) girl making love while the girl most wear the guy's football pads. But that's not enough to last the whole movie. Most of the other shots at comedy miss by a mile. ... And don't even get me started on how little this movie gives to THE SIXTH SENSE. Oh, and one more thing. I saw this BEFORE I saw SCREAM, which is this movie's principal target, and know what, SCREAM was twice as funny.
0316666343|4.0|I found this book to be extrememly interesting and I recommend it to everyone.  This book was writen from a unique viewpoint which I have not seen before in any other book.  The plot of the story kept me interested until the final page.  The end was the only dissappointing aspect which I felt fell short of the excellence of the rest of the novel.  Even with this unsatisfying ending, I still highly recommend this book to all.
B00005221L|5.0|PREDATOR was an absolutely fantastic action/adventure sci-fi thriller from the mind of John McTiernan, whose also behind DIE HARD, THE HUNT FOR RED OCTOBER, and countless others. The simple storyline involves Major Dutch Schaeffer (played by AH-NULD) leading commandos into the jungle to rescue hostages. They group slowly begins to realize that they're being hunted by an invisible, hostile alien game hunter with dreadlocks that makes trophies of humans. That's about all there is to the story, but it is very well executed and is easily one of Schwarzenegger's and McTiernan's best.
B00006690G|5.0|this is the best album eminem has made. Beating the Marshall Mathers LP by one notch. SOngs are perfect, and Halies Song is really good. Its worth to be heard by those who aren't fans of eminem. If you don't like eminem, your CD collection is not complete without this album. 'Till i Collapse is also a great song and its not being put out there. The Clean CD has too many edits though. but anyway, great, GREAT CD!
6305161992|5.0|Tia Carrere NEKID, a pretty stoner decapitated by a samurai sword, nude women buried in sushi? Sure sounds like a porno film, don't it? Well, it's not. It's got nudity, kung fu, and Brandon Lee and that's more than what you'd ask out of this film. The Martial Arts scenes are excellent, ranging from a brawl in a bathhouse, to a duel in a street fair. There's also twice as much comedy here as you'd expect, most of it delivered by Brandon (\\"In between cooking cycles, your'e supposed to baste us.\\"). Dolph Lundgren is also fun to watch, and he sometimes rather inadvertendly contributes to the comedy (\\"Take this, point it in the direction things are, pull the trigger and they'll fall down.\\") For nudity, kung fu, and a very good film with Brandon Lee, SHOWDOWN is exceptional. Oh, speaking of Brandon, here's another of his humorous lines (\\"Kenner, just in case we get killed, I wanted to tell you, you have the biggest <BR>---- Iv'e ever seen.\\")
B00000JKH2|5.0|I love at the drive in's self title album with only 7 songs and i must say it's quite good to have something original. I mean there isn't one disapointing tune here and  the lirycs are out of this world. If your into good music buy it now !!
6304981635|5.0|With movies like preserved, Bruce Lee will never be dead. The Martial Arts battles (coreographed by Bruce himself) are all excellent, particular the final battle involving mirrors. It also features other Martial Arts warriors like Bolo Yeung (credited as Yang Sze), Bob Wall, Jim Kelly, and John Saxon, although most of them know better than to challenge Bruce to a fight. It's not half bad even for those looking for a story.
B000060P79|2.0|For anyone that is into the pop rock scene than this is a great cd for you.  For anyone with any kind of taste in rock will steer away from this album.  Songs like &quot;Perfect&quot; are so pop sounding that it makes me sick.  Lyrics are unimaginative and sound almost boy bandish.  Not a shred of decent rock in it.
B000002LQR|5.0|It's very difficult to provide a track-by-track rundown as the songs almost run into each other, creating the effect of an hour-long rock session. But I'll have a go. Don't be surprised if I seem a little negative: most tracks don't stand out, because the brilliance of this album is cumulative.<br />1. Power of Equality: a memorable chorus but the verses are a little dull. <BR>2. If You Have To Ask  again, memorable but not outstanding<BR>3. Breaking The Girl: Extremely powerful, one of the best.<BR>4. Funky Monks: Quite funky, with a catchy chorus<BR>5. Suck My Kiss: An excellent rock number.<BR>6. I Could Have Lied: fantastic ballad, better than Under The Bridge IMO.<BR>7. Mellowship Slinky In B Major: Doesn't stand out.<BR>8. The Righteous and the Wicked. Great song!<BR>9. Give It Away: Not bad.<BR>10. Blood Sugar Sex Magik: Awesomely funky song, finest rock number on the album.     <BR>11. Under The Bridge: You MUST have heard this song at some point in your life. Forget the All Saints version, this song is fantastic.<BR>12. Naked In The Rain: Not a standout, but good.<BR>13. Apache Rose Peacock: One of my favourites, a great chorus.<BR>14. Greeting Song: Pretty good.<BR>15. My Lovely Man: Ditto.<BR>16. Sir Psycho Sexy: Great ending, otherwise unspectacular.  <BR>17. They're Red Hot: A bit joky and lightweight, not so bad as some people say.
0688163173|5.0|It is difficult, no, near impossible, to believe that Dennis Lehane could continue to top his previous books, but Shutter Island is proof positive that Lehane is destined to be one of the English language's leading writers of this, or any other century.  If you don't buy this book fast to ensure you get a first edition, you're going to be sorry.  Above all Lehane is a master story teller, and Shutter Island is riveting.  Combine this with Lehane's command of the language and ability to write exciting, vibrant and beautiful phrases, and sentences, and you begin to understand why this man is destined to become a National Treasure!<br />If you like books, you'll love Shutter Island.  Thank you Dennis Lehane!
0316666343|5.0|I had, until now, been a hard-core NON-fiction reader. Something I had read, probably the fact that the book is narrated by a dead girl, in some review months ago caught my attention and I bought this book as a travel and beach book for my spring vacation. I made the perfect choice. This book artfully uses a minimum of words to powerfully create the most poignant moments. I'm a 45 yr. old former Marine and am not used to shedding tears, pausing and pondering while reading. This book weaves a sweet, touching story and offers many thoughtful comments on all of our relationships.

0688163173|5.0|Dennis Lehane has another hit on his hands with &quot;Shutter Island.&quot;  I read this novel in one sitting because I got hooked right from the first page.<br />U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are sent to Ashecliffe Hospital for the Criminally Insane to find escaped patient Rachael Solando, who is a murderess.  They run into problems, however, like the hurricane that hits the island their first night there and they begin to find that a lot of strange things are going on in the hospital as well.  However, nothing is as it seems at Ashecliffe, and that made the story even more intriguing.  As a result, I found I had to keep reading to find out the real truth while also trying to figure out how it will end.  My advice to anyone who chooses to read this novel is to NOT try to figure out the ending because the odds are that you won't.<br />I really loved this story and highly recommend it to anyone who is a fan of thrillers.  Add it to your MUST READ list today!

6304806426|4.0|This may not be a very great movie, but it haunts me years after I first watched it. Was it the mood? The setting, or the story itself? There wasn't a plot as such and things happened as if in a trance or in a dream, and the characters were quite peculiar and so were the events and such mysteries were compounded by a strong sense of suspense. Was it only to the credit of the director, or just the acting staff, or...? Anyway, it managed to keep your concentration, involving and absorbing the audience so that they forget about their daily routine and above all, it impresses.
B000068FUS|5.0|Essential, classic, amazing, anyone who doesn't get this immediately just doesn't get it. So much heart it spills all over the place. One of the few records that gives me chills, along with records by Gillian Welch, Miles Davis, Low, Brian Eno, Songs:Ohia and (especially) that new Damien Jurado CD.
B00007E8V4|5.0|This is one of my favorite bands. They always have been ever since their self titled in 98 i think. This album is billed as B-Sides and Rarities, but they are really just recordings that didn't make it onto Toxicity. They didn't make it on not because they weren't good enough, but simply because Serj didn't think they fit with Toxicity's theme. I personally think this CDis a lot better than Toxicity. There is not enough praise in the world to give to this band. Acid tongued lyrics, crunching riffs, sick drumbeats, amazing basslines, insane vocals, this band is just perfect. Chic n' stew is about advertising and a great way to open a cd. Innervision and Bubbles follow. Boom! is a really catchy song about war. I don't like Nuguns that much. American Dream Denial is probably the best song on the cd, about anti-war and historical atrocities. Mr. Jack is a slower Spider-like song. I-E-A-I-A-O is probably my favorite song on the cd. Awesome middle-eastern chorus and a cool rapping part. 36 is kind of a stupid filler track but it flows very nicely into Pictures which has really odd lyrics. Highway song is next, which is my other favorite. Amazing chorus. Then comes the System, a very anti-government song with a really cool guitar part. Egobrain is a slower song with a kind of uneasy chorus. Thetawaves is really powerful. Roulette is the softest SOAD song ever, written almost ten years ago. Serj displays a softer voice on this one and there are no drums on this track. Lastly is streamline, which I would say is the best song but I've heard it way too many times (it is also on the Scorpion King Soundtrack). It would be downright foolish not to own this CD
B00006FDCD|5.0|I've never been a Stephen King fan. Granted, I'm only fourteen, but I've found his books hard to finish.That is, until I read IT. FInally, a few weeks ago I finished. Then I decided to watch the movie again, and was rather impressed. The only thing wrong was the older portrayl of Ben Hanscom, and even that was impressive. The story begins with Mike Hanlon calling all of his friends to come back and battle IT, the monster of Derry that stalks children- No adults can see them. The only problem is, IT is a true monster and has never been beaten. Here's a quick character run down:<BR>Beverly Marsh- a tough girl with red hair who had an abusive father. Brave, great with a slingshot.<BR>Bev Rogan- Top fashion designer. Beautiful, desirable. The only problem- she married Tom Rogan, a copy of her father.<BR>Bill Denbrough- The leader. Stuttering worse since his brother's death, always has a plan.<BR>William Denbrough- Popular writer and screenplay writer. Married famous actress Audra.<BR>Ben Hanscom- large, shy boy who loves reading.

6302814359|3.0|I am a big fan of the Return Of The Living Dead series. My favorite on out of the series is part 1, but this is my second favorite. It has alote more comedy in it than the first one. I really like the whole cast which includes one of my favorite actress Suzanne Snyder (who played Debbie in Killer Klowns From Outer Space) The Spec FX in this movie are just as good as in part one. The movie starts off with an army truck dilivering some barrels which include dead bodies in them, and a gas which makes dead things come back to life. Everything is going smoothly untill one of the barrels falls off the truck into a sewer, thats when all the trouble begins. I recomend this movie alote.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I often find that the movies that win awards (particularly Oscars) are not necessarily the movies I wish to see.  Sometimes, in fact, I have never even heard of these award-winning films.  No, I am not referring to foreign films or documentaries or the winner of the \\"Most Obscure Film from Kazakhstan\\" prize.  I'm talking about the big awards for movies of which I should have at least heard.<br />Five movies were nominated for this year's Best Animated Feature award.  Included in the list of nominees were such films as Lilo &amp; Stitch, Ice Age, and Treasure Planet.  The only nominee of which I had heard nothing was Spirited Away, a Japanese film dubbed into English.  Obviously, this chapped my delicate sensibilities, so I immediately arranged to view the film - to my complete and utter joy.<br />Spirited Away is the story of Chihiro, a young, selfish girl who is thrust into a surreal world of talking frogs, witches, dragons and spirits.  Through her attempts to rescue her parents who have been turned into pigs (that'll teach them to eat the food of the spirits), Chihiro learns lessons about friendship, bravery and love.  I'm not doing the story justice, simply because I don't feel that I'm up to the task.  <br />If I was forced to describe Spirited Away in ten words or less, I would have to call it \\"Alice in Wonderland embedded in Japanese mythology\\".  Unfortunately, it is the Japanese mythology that is the only fault.  And, though it pains me to say it, the fault is mine - I am simply not well-versed in that type of literature.<br />Japanese audiences loved this movie.  With its original theatrical release in Japan in 2001, Spirited Away became the highest grossing film ever for that country.  I loved the movie, too, despite my admitted short-comings.<br />That being said, I would recommend that parents screen this film before showing it to younger children, as some scenes may be a bit frightening.  For the parents that do watch the film - don't be surprised if you enjoy the film more than your kids.  I suppose that's as good a reason as any to rent it for them...

0671042858|2.0|If you are looking for an amazing story filled with suspense and horror steer clear of \\"The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon.\\"  Although this was the first story I read by Stephen King, I found it to be lacking in substance and terror from what I've been told about his other books.  This is the story of a girl named Trisha Mcfarland and her \\"troubles\\".  The book starts off telling the reader about the Mcfarland family and how they have gotten a divorce and now Trisha and her brother live with their mother.  Their mother decides to take them out on a hike and along the way Trisha decides to wander off the trail and go to the bathroom.  Before she knows it her mother and brother are nowhere to be found.  The rest of the story is now a long and boring telling of how she wanders yet further from civilization and any hope of ever seeing her family again.  King is known for his suspense and terror but this book was more of a nature story.  The only part that is even remotely scary is the fact that she thinks something is watching her all along and waiting for the right time to go in for the kill.  Throughout the story the reader is made to believe that it is a human following her; but at the end it turns out to be a bear that gets shot by a man that is wandering through the woods.  Also what makes this book really boring and actually very weird is her obsession with the baseball player Tom Gordon, as mentioned in the title.  When she first gets lost in the woods she is very worried about her Walkman and saving the batteries so she can listen to the games at Fenway Park.  She then starts to imagine that Tom Gordon is standing there with her throughout the story. While all this is going on in the woods Trisha's family has gotten a search party out looking for her with helicopters, dogs, and policemen leading the way.  King didn't focus on the search for Trisha very much the whole story was all about her walking through the woods trying to find her way home.  This book does not live up to the \\"Stephen King\\" name.  It is boring and lacking in the gore and bloody bodies that all King fans have grown accustomed to.  If you are looking for a story to read right before you go to bed that'll make you have sweet dreams and put you to sleep this is the book for you.  Otherwise, I would recommend that you read another King book or something with a little more action and suspense.e up to the \\"Stephen King\\" name.

1577311523|5.0|I was lucky enough to find this book in it's first month of print from a friend in Canada.  What a journey!  I have seen this (yes) \\"enlightened,\\" \\"self-realized\\" man many times and listened to his tapes over and over without ever tiring of them.  I have heard many people, from all religious and spiritual persuasions say \\"it's the purest essence of what we believe.\\"  Don't let it's simplicity fool you..it is NOT \\"new age palaver.\\"  It's depth is profound and I learn something new everytime I listen to the book on tape, because something new has opened up within me that allows me to hear it for the first time. <BR>   I would like to comment first hand on some of the things people have said in their reviews.  No, Eckhart does not live in a mansion.  He lives in a small apartment in Vancouver.  He has worn the same two jackets, slacks and sweaters every time I've seen him for the past four years.  He is brilliant, his message is unerringly consistent, as is his compassion, humor and understanding.  His love is palable.  His bearing is holy. He teaches in at least three maybe four languages but you don't need to even understand what he is saying to feel his amazing presence.  But, most importantly, don't be concerned with his human form, behavior or what he does outside of teaching.  It doesn't matter.  His state is your state, not yet realized.  His simple, beautiful teaching can take you there.<BR>    My life is transformed, my suffering greatly diminished because of his \\"practices.\\"  I can looking past the suffering of the world and see that all IS well in this divine game called life.  Let this become YOUR experience too.

B000002UUX|5.0|In my opinion, nothing Dave Mustaine has ever done in his entire career with Megadeth has ever really reached the same peak of quality that Metallica achieved with each of their albums (barring 1998's awful ReLoad).  However, in 1990, Dave Mustaine released &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; to the world's bloodthirsty metalheads, and came really, really, REALLY close.<br />&quot;Rust in Peace&quot; is a plutonium-packed straight-for-the-jugular thrash gem.  With this album, Dave Mustaine, Marty Friedman, Nick Menza, and David Ellefson proved to the world once and for all that Megadeth was NOT a band that was going to live in Metallica's shadow, and secured their position as the OTHER big name in the explosive thrash movement.  Though in the past, Mustaine's songwriting skills had the nagging quality of being somewhat hit-and-miss, (some songs were superb, others downright bad) on this album he was firing on all cylinders and reached a peak in creativity.  From a thrash standpoint, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; shocked nearly all and reached new heights in creatve and genuine songwriting, where Dave managed to mold and bend the tricks of the thrash formula as he saw fit, and still managed to produce a dynamite song in the process.  Nearly every song on this album takes daring and surprising musical risks, with intricate yet compelling guitar leads and lengthy, almost jammy guitar solos, all handled with an impressive amount of creativity even Metallica never reached in the peak of their career.  Listen to a song on this album... odds are you haven't heard another thrash song like it from anyone.<br />On a track-for-track basis, this album is a machine, with songs ranging from great to awesome.  Each song is at the very least really good, with the vast majority qualifying for great and fantastic.  As for track favorites, &quot;Take No Prisoners&quot; is easily one of Megadeth's best and fastest songs, and what first got me hooked on the album.  &quot;Lucretia&quot; could easily usurp it as my favorite, with &quot;Tornado of Souls&quot; not far behind.<br />If there is anything working against this album, if not a reasonable explanation as to why Megadeth has never achieved the level of fame that Metallica has, it's the fact that vocal-wise, Dave Mustaine is certainly no James Hetfield.  In fact, I'm going to come right out and say it: Dave Mustaine is a horrible singer, and it is the one truly negative aspect of this album, and the reason it cannot be classified as perfection.<br />As a whole, the vocals on this album just plain stink, and Dave really doesn't know how to handle his voice very well.  Far too often he utilizes an extroadinarily annoying high-pitched wail normally reserved for the heavyweights like Bruce Dickinson and Matt Barlow, (not quite the echoing screams they give, but a tone of voice only they can really handle) and even Hetfield knows to stay far away from this vocal territory.  Even worse, many songs (Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, etc.) incorporate this multi-singing effect into the choruses, which could be the whole band singing the chorus, or many overdubs of Mustaine, but whatever it is, it's downright obnoxious.<br />Unfortunately, the poor vocals are a heavy criticism, and it takes a few major points away from the album, but thankfully the music easily makes up for what the singing lacks.  It can be considered high praise if an album's music alone can make it an essential purchase, and that's exactly what &quot;Rust In Peace&quot; is.  After a while, you somewhat get used to the vocals and learn to enjoy the whole album overall, and understand just how important it was to the thrash scene.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Anyone who professes not to like American Life doesn't understand it, and I am including whoever reviewed it for Amazon.com.  They are skeptics who want to see Madonna fail. Which she won't!! (see track no. 6= Nothing Fails).  This album is not made for people who loved Ray of Light or Music. It is made to challenge the way people think about their lives.  It isn't easy to look in the mirror, and that is proven by anyone who gives this album an unfavorable review.  If we look at ourselves too long, we see the flaws that lie beneath the surface.  Madonna has gone from making pop music to making art and some may not follow her as she grows as an artist, pity for them.  They are going to miss the best music of her career.  This album is pure Madonna, through and through.  It may end up being like her Erotia album, unappreciated for a while then embraced for the true masterwork it is.  One word to anyone who may be thinking about this album without having heard it: Even if for some reason you don't like the American Life single, keep listening: the rest of the album is as varied as any she has done before, and yet is one of her most cohesive efforts to date.  In short American Life by Madonna is a masterpiece that cannot be denied and will not be brought down by anyone's negativity.  To quote track number 5, Nobody Knows Me: \\"Why should I care what the world thinks of me? Won't Let a stranger give me a social disease.\\"  Don't be given a social disease by naysaying reviewers!!! Buy this album and improve your life!!!
B00000253N|5.0|Once every few thousand years the stars align and bring the world pure spectral glory. The recording of this album was such an event. The songs cut through the malaise of daily life to get down to the essential elements of the heart, soul, and spirit! Taken as a whole, this work is a divine event!
B00008S2VF|5.0|this album is eleven songs so infused with pure artistic genius it is sure to leave some people out in the cold.  This album will surprise you and make you think. If you buy it you will realize how lucky you are to own it. Buy it NOW!!!!!!! you will not regret it.
B000000W5B|5.0|Sue me, but I'm from the camp that says \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" is one underrated record. Four stars is really more accurate for the Stones standard, but for many other lesser bands, this would be a career highlight. I agree with many others in the \\"Goat's Head Soup\\" cult that this album gets most of its flack for following the Stones' most prolific period. Sure it's a step down from the \\"big four,\\" but come on, people. This still put the Stones above many other bands of that period, since they were coming down from arguably the highest peak in rock music at the time. All right, let's get to the actual songs before I lose my cool. \\"Dancin' With Mr. D\\" is considered by some to be a low point, but I digress. It rocks, in a mellow, funky way like most of the album, but it still rocks and has an enjoyable beat. \\"100 Years Ago\\" is quirky but also enjoyable. It stands as a unique song in the Stones catalog, as it is so schizophrenic in it's soft to hard tempo changes. \\"Coming Down Again\\" is the most mellow of the mellow, featuring Keith in an underrated song that obviously seems to be about his heroin addiction at the time. \\"Heartbreaker\\" is undeniably the high point in terms of rockers, as well as one that people actually recognize as a minor hit. I like this one a lot, it rocks in an incredibly \\"groovy\\" way (no pun intended) and it should have been on \\"Forty Licks.\\" Another one of their most underrated. Then comes the center of controversy in an already controversial album-\\"Angie.\\" Legend has it that this is the Stones hit song you either love or hate. I admit that I hated it at first, but if any song by them has come to grow on me, it's this one. Now I think it's one of their great ballads, even if it's no \\"Wild Horses.\\" Some may find it to be a cheesy love song (therefore the Stones out of their element), but I think it doesn't turn into a joke. It's not amazing, but it's a nice effort, especially the whispered portion. Then we have \\"Silver Train\\", which although is not one of their best rockers, is still enjoyable. The lyrics are funny too if not taken seriously, showing the \\"shoot first and ask questions later\\" philosophy of their one night stands. And I don't think the filler really starts until \\"Hide Your Love\\" which is tedious and \\"Can You Hear the Music\\", which is just too cornball. Then we have the finale, \\"Star Star,\\" the one other great rocker of the album. If you consider yourself to be \\"mild-mannered\\" or \\"easily offended,\\" stay the hell away from this track, though I honestly think any true low down, dirty Stones fan will be right there shouting out that foul, but catchy chorus with Mick. I know I do. So, there you have it (sorry about the lengthiness). Some hate \\"Goats Head Soup\\" for it's quirks, but what I can say, they are fine by me and make things interesting. Check it out, owning one more Stones album won't hurt.
B00005YXZH|5.0|If you buy this album, listen to it ten times before you make up your mind. The first time - I HATED IT. The tenth time - I got it. You can't &quot;Listen&quot; to it. You must experience it. If the reviewers who gave this one or two stars keep it in their players they will be back to beg forgiveness for their rashness.
B00008J4P5|5.0|Every one's saying it, but I assure it's true-&quot;Elephant&quot; is the best from the Stripes yet. Why? Well, I think they are cutting back on the filler and really trying to make every song a pretty decent listen, first of all. My friend adored &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; but I thought the second half was weak in spots. &quot;Elephant&quot; seems to make up for that problem by making the second half rock even harder than the first. My friend has yet to buy it (he is still transfixed with &quot;White Blood Cells&quot;) but I think he is missing out on this, the better album of the two. &quot;Black Math&quot; is my favorite Stripes song yet, it rocks like the freakin' apocalypse and is too cool for words. &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; is sensual without coming off as a cliche (not easy for lesser bands), including a funny lyrical reference to one of the Stripes' labels &quot;Third Man.&quot; The introduction to &quot;Little Acorns&quot; is hilarious and keeps people from taking the album too seriously. &quot;Girl, You Have No Faith in Medicine&quot; is the album b-side &quot;White Blood Cells&quot; wish it had and &quot;It's True That We Love One Another&quot; works great as a hilarious joke of a closer. Anyone who is annoyed with it needs more appreciation for a band that has a great sense of humor about themselves. The whole overblown brother-sister media mystery is mocked (&quot;I love Jack White like a little brother&quot;) and it turns out Jack has a new lover after Meg (gasp!). To each his own, but I think this is the cherry on the cake of &quot;Elephant.&quot;
B00008S2VG|4.0|Madonna opens her latest CD American Life with it's electronic pop title track and thats was a good idea because the song is enough to get you enthralled and wait to see what else is there in the upcoming tracks. Unfortunately you are slightly dissapointed with Hollywood, I'm So Stupid and Love Profusion.  Don't get me wrong these are not horrible songs . . . but coming after the explosive title track the listener is a little let down but dont fret because Track 6 --- Nothing Fails is awesome.  This is one of the best Madonna songs (dare i say it) ever !!!!!!!!  It's emotional and sweet brings tears to my eyes (makes me think about the person that i love and i can't be with right now) It follows in I Deserve It (from the 2000 disc MUSIC) tradition and is alone enough of a reason to buy the disc.  #7 Intervention is great also #8 X-Static Process is a very strong song also which finds Madonna questioning and making a statement about her relationship with GOD while sweetly harmonizing with herself over a simple guitar the song is very Jewel like.  Die Another Day is instant gratification and she ends the album with Easy Ride (pretty much similar to 2000's Gone from MUSIC)This album has its moments and just like my first listen to 2000 MUSIC i was dissapointed but just like that CD grew on me this one is growing on me now .  My Final Verdict Buy It and listen to it a lot and then you'll like it.
B00006AW2G|5.0|All right, feel free to disagree, but I think this was a notch up from \\"Beggars Banquet.\\" \\"Let It Bleed\\" is my runner-up choice for the Stones best, as I find much great material here to choose from. \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is arguably the single most song the band ever laid down and as an opener, it commands much authority. \\"Love in Vain\\", although a Robert Johnson cover, beats out \\"No Expections\\" for me. I have a minor quibble with \\"Country Honk\\" though. Sure, I find it survivable and still decent, but the original \\"Honky Tonk Women\\" would have sufficed for me. The Stones must have had that \\"all new album material\\" mentality again, but this cover shows they were lacking and should have just caved in to the superior original.<BR>\\"Live With Me\\" is a great rocker and no, I don't think \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is too long. \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\" is a great closer, but unfortunately, due to radio overplay, it has overshadowed other great Stones closers. The others are slightly less memorable, but still top-notch. I admit to being biased to the Mick Taylor period (my favorite), but anyone should be able to admit that this was one of their very best efforts.
B000002BVN|4.0|People totally over look this album. I have owned this one for a while now and I think it's great. The remixes of the other songs I think are awsome. My favorite one is Scream Louder from the remixes. These are my ratings on this album:<br />BLOOD ON THE DANCE FLOOR: An awsome song, it has a good beat and some lines can get stuck in your head.<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>MORPHINE: A good song with a funky beat<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>SUPERFLY SISTER: To me this song has one of the best beats on the album. The lyrics are in perfect order<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>GHOSTS: My favotite song on the album. I think it has the best beat and the most memerable lines on the album.<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>IS IT SCARY: Very, Very Similar to ghosts but it has a james bond type beat which makes the sound different than ghosts, but a good song.<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>SCREAM LOUDER,MONEY,2 BAD,STRANGER IN MOSCOW,THIS TIME AROUND,EARTH SONG,YOU ARE NOT ALONE,AND HIStory are all awsome remixes which I think made this album go platinum.<BR>----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>To me it's one of the best albums but he could sing a bit louder but all over, great album.<br />Keep on goin' MJ!
B000000W5P|5.0|I think \\"Some Girls\\" is just a pinch overrated, just a couple inches or so. Please don't misunderstand, it is great by Stones standards, but to me it seems like this is the only album after \\"Exile on Main St.\\" that some people give a hoot about. Heaven forbid I should mention \\"Goat's Head Soup\\", which I think is probably at least as good overall. But let me stop whining now, I'm not here to anger, just to let people know that the Stones still put out some decent (not amazing, but still decent quality) albums after \\"Exile\\" (up until say, \\"Tattoo You\\") and that those records should not be forgotten in the midst of \\"Some Girls.\\" But hey, I can still see the attraction to \\"Some Girls,\\" after all, you get not one, two, but three great Stones singles. The first is \\"Miss You\\", an undeniably great opener about drowning your sorrows in substances (\\"a case of wine\\") over a lost love. If the Stones ever did a great \\"loungy\\" track-this was it. You also get \\"Beast of Burden\\", another ode to love gone sour and feelings of being overcontrolled in a relationship. In addition, there is \\"Shattered\\", which suprisingly works well as a closer here, being the Stones most famous ode to New York that shows a general contempt for the filth of the city (including its junkies). In fact, this album is probably the Stones ever came to a concept album, as \\"Miss You\\", \\"Some Girls\\", and \\"Beast of Burden\\" all concern difficulties with women. Beside the three singles and the title track, however, I think the album sags just a little. \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" is a good, but not great song about when the ... hits the fan, in my mind. \\"Imagination\\" is decent enough I guess, though it is a cover. \\"Lies\\" and \\"Respectable\\" are decent rockers, but not the Stones best ones. Then there's \\"Far Away Eyes\\", which is too cheesy for me (sorry) and \\"Before They Make Me Run\\" which I must admit I see as one of Keith's weaker moments. Still, this album is very recommended. It's great and worth owning, but if you ask me, it shouldn't be the only Stones album you buy outside their prime period. Look into it, but don't stop here.
B000021YQV|5.0|System of a Down are one of the most original bands today. Go look for someone who sounds like them, I dare you! You won't because no one does. Their sound is so unique it's hard to explain. Serj's vocals are very powerful, Daron's guitar work is increadable (I think he's one of the top three guitarist over the last five years), Shavo's bass is always pounding and John's drumming is very good. <br />Prison Song-THRASH!!! This song is thrash. All about the wrong doings of the leagle system. 5/5<br />Needles-THRASH!!!! Yet another thrash like song. One of my favorites. Kind of funny, at first.5/5<br />Deer Dance-THRASH!!! Here is some more nu-thrash (wow, that's a good name for it, nu-thrash). This song is one of my favorites as well. \\"Behind the Staples Center you can see America!\\" 5/5<br />Jet Pilot-Nu-thrash/death growls, amazing combination. I don't know what it is, but I really like this song. The lyrics make no sence at all to me. 5/5<br />X-Different than the last four, very Mid-Eastern, good. 4/5<br />Chop Suey-If you havn't heard this yet you've been living under a large grey stone for the last two years! Very good byt not the best. Very unthrash. 4/5<br />Bounce-Nu-thrash/strange lyrics. That's all I have to say. 5/5<br />Forest-Here we leave nu-thrash behind us to move onto some more Mid-East stuff. Very tribal drumming, awsome. 5/5<br />ATWA- Second slowest song on the whole album. Very cool lyrics. 5/5<br />Science-Ramblings about how science \\"has failed our mother Earth,\\" cool! 5/5<br />Shimmy-Very fast song, strange lyrics, catchy. 4/5<br />Toxicity-My favorite song on the album. Awsome drumming and guitar, very good lyrics. Very hard at the end. \\"New what do you own the world? How do you own disorder?\\" 7/5<br />Psycho-Nu-thrash!!! Lyrics are quite strange, I think the guitar solo at the end is awsome! 5/5<br />Aerials-Another one you've had to have heard if you watch MTV2 or Much Music. Slower song, kind of like ATWA. 5/5<br />If you don't own this CDyet, where have you been? Go out and buy it know and speak the word of SOAD!!!
B000000W5L|5.0|Many think this is the Stones best, but I get the feeling that the reasoning behind this is mainly that it's their only double album. I'll still give it five stars for the highlights, but I honestly think there is a little filler-they were trying to fill 2 LPs after all. Let's start with the good stuff. The send-off track, \\"Rocks Off,\\" is the best moment for me, though I hate to admit this since it's the earliest song in the set. This may be my all-around favorite Stones rocker, the insane beat has a drive that's hard to match. It is certainly one of the main highlights here. Of course, one could argue that each side ends with a winner, namely \\"Tumblin Dice\\", \\"Lovin Cup\\", \\"Let it Loose\\", and \\"Soul Survivor.\\" My favorite of these is \\"Let it Loose,\\" probably my second favorite song. It has a good melody and message. Many of the other songs are decent, but my honest opinion of \\"Exile on Main St.\\" is that everybody has a couple different picks that really stand out for them. I certainly respect the Stones for the amount of experimenting they do with their sound on this album, but really these experiments kind of lead to a mixed bag, leading everyone to lean towards the portions they find most successful. \\"Happy\\" is a great moment for Keith and I don't really mind \\"Turd on the Run\\" or \\"I Just Want to See His Face\\", even though I could see how they could be called filler. The former has a beat that drives it nicely, though it is kind of forgettable. The latter is forgettable too, though I find it to be a nice, interesting change of pace. For me, the real filler is \\"All Down the Line\\" and Robert Johnson's \\"Stop Breaking Down\\", as they just seem like dead average melodies to me, though they are performed with vigor. What else to mention? \\"Shine a Light\\" is decent I guess, plus it makes a nice contridiction to \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" and all the other ... music the band has supposedly made. I give up. It's really hard to be objective with this album since it's so varied andoffers a little something for all Stones lovers. Y'know, something for the country lovers, something for the rocker lovers, etc. You should be all means own it, this is a decent double album after all (in the top five for them) and it will fill you up when one Stones record just won't do.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Tough, rocking effort by the Big Mac, full of twisted emotions, snarling guitars, raw and real love. Some of Lindsey Buckingham's cuts have the unmistakable stamp of \\"solo project\\" on them, but that's not to say they're no good or that they don't fit in snugly with his more shared opportunities. All of Stevie Nicks' tracks were produced by Buckingham, and it's wonderful after all these years to hear their voices wrap around eachother. Christine McVie makes a brief appearance(on the glittering \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\")and proves she was missed, but Buckingham, Nicks, Mick Fleetwood and John McVie are valiant in her absence. Best tracks: \\"Bleed To Love Her\\", \\"Destiny Rules\\", and Stevie's closing lament \\"Goodbye Baby\\". I can't stop...thinking about tomorrow. A+
B00006AW2J|5.0|Don't get me wrong-prime Rolling Stones is absolutely some of the best rock music you can buy-but \\"Beggars Banquet\\" is not my favorite Stones album. I only bring this up because it seems like this is so many people's favorite and that leaves me a little puzzled. Yeah, this a five star album and a must for any Stones collection-it has \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" and \\"Street Fighting Man\\" as the side openers. Yet some of the acoustical material (while still very good) doesn't have enough bite or stand out enough for me. This includes tracks like \\"Dear Doctor\\", \\"Prodigal Son\\", and \\"Factory Girl.\\" Not to mention \\"Jigsaw Puzzle\\", which, although decent, seems to rip off the rambling verses of a Dylan song. Plus, an inclusion of \\"Jumping Jack Flash\\" would have been nice, previous single or not. Still, I hate to complain and be critical of this album, because the material I really like is outstanding. Besides the side-openers, \\"Stray Cat Blues\\" is a tumbling rocker about underage groupies that kicks arse and takes names. In addition, \\"Salt of the Earth\\" is undeniably an awesome closer (perhaps Keith's finest vocal moment) and it doesn't get enough credit in comparison to \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\" I think it is just as good. So anyway, pick it up, despite my minor criticisms. You might dig the acoustic songs more than me. Let it be known that I still love the album as a whole and it is still one of the Stones' five best.
B00008DDHZ|5.0|\\"Bloody Sunday\\" is a remarkable and powerful film; a rare breed of film that makes you wonder why such a gem goes so unrecognized by moviegoers.  This is such a well-done and important film that has the ability to re-create history with pure authenticity.  One of the best things I did last week was purchase this DVD.  As soon as I started it, I knew there was no turning back.<br />I had never heard of the event itself (here's my age showing again).  Never even learned about it in high school.  As a matter of fact, I'm learning there's LOTS of things I never learned in high school, but back to the movie.  \\"Bloody Sunday\\" is a documentary-like film that re-creates what transpired on Sunday, January 30th, 1972.  In a Civil Rights demonstration in Northern Ireland, British troops opened fire on protesters when things were getting hairy, which would eventually lead to 27 wounded and 13 dead.  This was a tragedy that struck a major blow to the Civil Rights movement, and to Ireland and Britain as well.<br />From what I understand, this is still a very controversial topic, even today.  Nobody is still 100% sure of what exactly happened.  Both sides are still debating and offering their versions of what really went down.  I don't know much about the event, as I said in the beginning of this review.  What I do know is that this film was done in a very realistic and authentic way, and I believe that what happened on that tragic day might've gone down the way it did in the film, or very close to it.  I also believe that the movie shows both sides, not just one.<br />This film was done entirely hand-held, meaning not once did the filmmakers use a dolly or camera stands.  The end result is that it gives it the raw and realistic feel that it needs to be affective.  There is no story or plot in the movie.  The movie isn't there to tell a single story or show us \\"characters;\\" the only goal is to try to educate us all on what happened on January 30th.  You never look at the actors as actors, but more like the real people themselves.  In fact, when I was watching this, I was very convinced that I wasn't watching a movie, but a real documentary.<br />The DVD comes equipped with some very nice special features.  Those being two commentary tracks and 2 documentary features.  That may not sound like a lot, but when you view or hear them, you feel very satisfied.  It would've been nice to have a few more extras, but I can't really complain.  Nor do I want to.<br />I really believe the filmmakers when they say that they did not make \\"Bloody Sunday\\" to open old wounds.  They want to educate us all on what happened and they want us to confront it.  Much like when an addict has a problem but he or she won't admit it, the problem will never come to a resolution if we continue to ignore it.  I urge every history teacher to make their students watch this movie.  I urge EVERYONE I know to give this movie a try.  It is a rare and unique gem that takes historical films to a new level that it has never reached before.  It's a shame that not many have seen it, but my hope is that more people will see it now since it is available to own and rent on DVD and video.  \\"Bloody Sunday\\" is an experience you will never forget, and it is an important one you do not want to miss out on.  Definitely makes my Top 10 of 2002 list, without question.actors, but more like the real people themselves.

B00008H2LB|2.0|This new album is very incomplete. i would like to trade in my enhanced cd content for the rest of the music on this cd. only 37 minutes of music??? thats about half an album. the music is good and most of the songs are catchy, but every song needs to be longer, and there needs to be more go and less show...
B00006RIO7|5.0|I have seen the movie &quot;Chicago&quot; five times in the movie theatre! I just love it! Never have I seen a show so refreshing and keep you awake! Carherine Zeta-Jones is wonderful, along with Renee Zellweger, and Richard Gere...who knew he could tap dance! This is a soundtrack that you must have if you are a Chicago fan, a musical fan, or just a movie fan! Buy it! It's wroth it!
B000066NW0|5.0|Avril Lavigne is the greatest &quot;poper&quot; in the world. Losing Grip is the perfect start to Let Go...beautiful. For Complicated it goes in a way that makes it a No.1 hit. Sk8er Boi is overexaggerated for its content but its really so beautiful...I'm With You is slower, but a wonderful song of lost. Mobile is fast and cool, Unwanted is loud and structured in a way that makes u hooked @ first hearing...Tomorrow is a nice song, just average maybe. Anything but Ordinary is the song of the album, the way it describes Avril Roxs. Things I'll Never Say is hip, My World is simply fabulous, wonderful lyrics. Nobody's fool..the lyrics are gr8t 2!
B000066NW0|5.0|I really love this album! Avril Lavigne is so young and so talented; it's amazing. Her lyrics have a lot of meaning and I think she sings very well.<BR>Here are all her songs:<BR>1) Losing Grip -- A nice, hard song about an old boyfriend with whom Avril couldn't connect emotionally. Nice beat.<BR>2) Complicated -- A nice song about people who try to be cool, while making fools of themselves. A very peppy song; her first hit.<BR>3) Sk8er Boi -- A peppy song about a punk kid who has a crush on a stuck-up ballet girl. The lyrics are really cute.<BR>4) I'm With You -- A nice, comparitively softer song about feeling lonely.<BR>5) Mobile -- A peppy song about going from one place to another and not staying put anywhere.<BR>6) Unwanted -- A hard song about being ignored and unwanted. I really like the tune of this song.<BR>7) Tomorrow -- One of my favourites, a soft song that really brings out her vocal talent.<BR>8) Anything But Ordinary -- Another one of my favourites, this is a great song about wanting to go to extremes and living life to the fullest. A must-hear!<BR>9) Things I'll Never Say -- Another favourite, this song is about trying to be perfect in front of a person you really like and all the things you're wishing inside. Another cool, must-hear.<BR>10) My World -- A cute, peppy song about growing up in the small town of Napanee in Ontario, which has a population of five thousand. The tune is really nice and catchy.<BR>11) Too Much To Ask -- Not as good as the others, this song is about people who always feel sorry for themselves and don't smile. What I can't understand is, how can she stick with a guy like that or fall for him in the first place?<BR>12) Naked -- A cool, soft song about people who see right through you and you feel really comfortable with.<br />Some people may have heard her live and been put off, but she sounds much better on her album, so don't dismiss it just because she's not so good live.  She's very young, so maybe it'll take her some timeto get used to singing live and stuff, but she is very talented and the CD is really good.<BR>All-in-all, this is a great album and I'd like to congratulate Avril Lavigne on such a cool debut album.
0066214122|2.0|Crichton's &quot;Prey&quot; explores the possibilities and the potential catastrophies that might occur with nanotechnology. One reading a Chrichton novel expects a consistent dose of science, yet despite the interesting theme of this novel, the first 130 pages or so of the novel is devoted entirely to the main character's family problems. I am amazed that I continued reading about such boring and ultimately inconsequential situations.<br />Although Crichton's characters in &quot;Prey&quot; are more &quot;real&quot; and human than Chrichton's characters usually are, the dialogue is ridiculous. The main characters children speak to each other (and their parents) like brats. The adults rarely sound much better.<br />The novel has many positive points and the middle portions of the novel are interesting and the pages turn quickly. The ending is poorly written and did not satisfy me. Although Chrichton attempts to tie the ending to the beginning, this technique, while usually effective, did not work well here.<br />Without a doubt, Crichton is a brilliant mind and a great writer, but &quot;Prey&quot; needed a team of editors. He certainly could have done better.
B00008CLOA|5.0|This is an update to my original review of the SACD version.<br />I bought a 5.1-capable amp last Friday, and naturally DSotM was the first album I wanted to test.  I have to say I was totally overwhelmed.  It's not just a surround mix in which the sounds coming out of the rear speakers are the same as those coming out of the front, but muted and delayed.  No, many sound effects appear to come out of ONLY the left-hand or right-hand speaker.  There is a very strong sense of direction to these.  The only time I have experienced anything similar was when I went to see Ken Russell's TOMMY in quintaphonic in Leicester Square, London.  But that was a very, very long time ago.<br />As a result of this, I am an instant SACD convert, and I plead with the record companies to sort out this destructive battle between SACD and DVD-Audio, which is having the effect of deterring most customers from investing in either technology.<br />The only down-side of this sonic orgasm is that you can no longer work with the album playing in the background.  You have to sit, or stand, and give this sound at least 90% of your attention.  And then you just smile with pure pleasure!
0671015206|5.0|One would expect a multi-millionaire to walk down the street with fancy clothes, wearing top-notch jewelry, and carrying a few shopping bags from high class stores while stepping into a brand new SUV or expensive car. After reading \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" by Thomas J. Stanley, Ph.D. and William D. Danko, Ph.D., my views have changed a bit.  This book explained how many millionaires do not hold up the typical stereotype. In fact, a large percent of them live in normal homes and are quite careful with their money when it comes to financial situations like paying for education and the yearly spendings.  The millionaires who live up to the stereotype do exist but contain many problems later in life when they try to retire.  The most important aspect of this book is the knowledge of how to become a millionaire. Anyone can strive for wealth and make good money if they know the correct ways to go about it. \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\" opened my eyes to interesting aspects of how to accomplish wealth in todays society. A key to this books success is the stories of people's lives who are millionaires today and how they either achieved wealth with their high income or killed it by spending more than was necessary.
0380977788|5.0|Gaiman tells us the story of Coraline, a young girl, and what she finds behind a bricked up wall in her new house. The tale is told simply and beautifully and like the best tales of this kind leaves a few ideas unexplored - for the reader's imagination to wonder and dream of. It is thoroughly enjoyable for all ages - and children in particular, who will be scared just enough to be nervous but not too much to stop reading. It is not as deeply thought provoking as the Sandman series but that is not its intention. It's aim is to haunt and to be enjoyed - and that it certainly does.
6304080921|5.0|Bruce Willis plays a difficult role in this film, he plays it well. The acting in this movie is superb all around. In the end we begin to care deeply about the two protagonists. That's incredible in itself, how often do we even have an inkling to care about a Bruce Willis character?<br />In this film we are introduced to Bruce Willis playing a psychiatric patient who thinks he's a time traveler. Sure, this plot has been done before, but never this well. Also, there are numerous twists in this film, all of which make it very entertaining. Towards then end though, you can figure out the \\"surprise\\" finish, but it doesn't matter.<br />Visually this film is great, I would recommend getting a DVD version of this if possible. Either way you'll enjoy it. It can be graphic at times, and the visual look of the \\"future\\" in this film is a bit unbelievable, and quite frankly very weird. <br />In the end, this is a great film. You can sit and watch it and enjoy it thoroughly. It's a film you can watch twice, though the ending is known, it forces you into a thoughtful state of wonder. Or something along that affect. Anyway, it's worth the price of admission. Though you may want to rent it first.
B00008S2VG|5.0|i am tempted to say this is my favorite madonna ablum.. It totally suprised me as far as the music and the lyrical content of the album. Every song on this cd is worth listenning to. I never have to skipped one single song. &quot;nothing fails&quot; created an amazing sound with the choir siinging from the background, The cd is inspiring and delightful and full of nice suprises. <BR>This cd goes far beyond my expectation. The cd might not be controversial , but its full of substance.
B000001EHS|2.0|[I ACTUALLY RATE THIS 2.5 STARS, NOT JUST TWO.]<br />Def Leppard's first greatest hits CD, ranging from 1981-1995.<br />(NOT 1980, as suggested on the cover.  There are ABSOLUTELY no songs present from their 1st album, \\"On Through the Night\\", which is by far one of their best albums ever)<br />I've never been a big fan of greatest hits packages because, in my point of view, they usually fail to capture the band's essence.  Def Leppard is one of those disappointments.  Don't get me wrong; Def Leppard is a great rock band which survived some turbulent times.  However, like Skid Row's greatest hits (which had virtually every song written by the bassist, so you would hardly find any songs on there written by other bandmembers), this one features many songs mostly written by producer Mutt Lange, which is a shame because there was A LOT of material not present on this album.<br />With that said, I still recommend getting this.  It will still get you hooked onto Def Leppard despite the bad tracklist.  After all, \\"Photograph\\" got me hooked in the first place.  I'd get it used, though, because more than 12 bucks is NOT worth this.<br />Here's the tracks:<br />\\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" - good song.  I have no complaints here, even it being the first track.<br />\\"Photograph\\" - Let's face it, Photograph ROCKS!  Great song.  As said above, it got me hooked to Def Leppard.<br />\\"Love Bites\\" - one of the best of their ballads.  Great chorus.<br />\\"Let's Get Rocked\\" - even though this song has some of the DUMBEST lyrics ever, it still rocks.  I never was a fan of Adrenalize, but I'm glad this one's here.<br />\\"Two Steps Behind\\" - this is the acoustic version.  Not bad, BUT THE ELECTRIC VERSION IS WAY BETTER.  This one doesn't capture Leppard very well.<br />\\"Animal\\" - I never did like this track at all that much, and even though it was a hit, they should've replaced this one with my favorite from Hysteria, \\"Gods of War.\\"<br />\\"Foolin'\\" - A very good ballad.  I'm glad it's here.<br />\\"Rocket\\" - I like this song, BUT THIS IS THE RADIO EDIT.  What's worse, they could've fit the original!  That ticks me off.<br />\\"When Love & Hate Collide\\" - this one's actually new.  It's a ballad, but I never really liked this one.  It just doesn't sound like Def Leppard, and therefore, DOES NOT BELONG.<br />\\"Armageddon It\\" - Great song, no complaints.<br />\\"Have You Ever Needed Someone So Bad?\\" - A ballad off of Adrenalize, but like \\"When Love & Hate Collide,\\" this one isn't that great at all.  Suggestion: Replace it with \\"White Lightning\\" and/or \\"Tear it Down,\\" also from Adrenalize.<br />\\"Rock of Ages\\" - Great song, no complaints.<br />\\"Hysteria\\" - I really like Hysteria, but this one doesn't capture the band's essence all that well.<br />\\"Miss You in a Heartbeat\\" - Another ballad?!  Not bad, but could've been dispensed for other songs, like maybe from the first album or my personal favorite from Pyromania, \\"Die Hard the Hunter.\\"<br />\\"Bringing on the Heartbreak\\" - Another ballad, yet again.  I really like this one, but UNFORTUNATELY they took off the Switch 625 instrumental piece that this song fades into.  SHAME.  Steve Clark must be rolling in his grave now.<br />All in all, this is definitely not one of the best greatest hits CDs ever.  They should've made a Double Disc set.  THAT would've pleased the Def Leppard fan much more.  This song caters more towards the Hysteria/Adrenalize crowd, which is quite a shame because 1) Pyromania is their BEST album, 2) On Through the Night is an excellent piece of metal history and it has hardly any pop influence whatsoever AND IT'S EXCLUSION IS ALMOST INEXCUSABLE, and 3) For some of the really good songs, they cut essential parts from them.  As such, this is disappointing to the extreme.  My suggestion is to buy the individual albums, but if you feel the need to get this, I'd get it for a low price.t\\" - I like this song, BUT THIS IS THE RADIO EDIT.

B00000099Y|5.0|1. This is my personal favorite record of all time.<BR>2. People that write a review saying how they wasted their time with this album are complete idots. Why waste your time writing a review if just the music was a waste of your time?
B00000JKH2|5.0|Now, you have music, and then there's At The Drive-In!  This album contains the secret to the new light of music.  Everyone contained in the \\"I love what's on MTV\\" genre would break through to the real music once they here this.  This album is very hard to not listen to.  If you had one bit of knowledge, you would buy this album just in respect to ATDI for creating such great music.<BR>Surgeon General Warning!: listening to this album may result in open-mindedness, trying to sing along, and repeatitive playing.<BR>P.S. DO NOT PLAY THIS ALBUM OUT!
B00008S2VG|5.0|Quite simply Madonna has suprised the world and her fans by producing what might be her best album to date.   AMERICAN LIFE is consistent, thematic, engrossing, and somehow emotional.  She has reinvented herself again, this time uses both Daft Punk style techno beats blended with acoustic political soul.  There is not a clinker in the bunch...no filler...just great, solid tracks.  RUN and buy this cd now...you won't be sorry.
B000089RVX|1.0|I find it sickening how people compare Evanescence to Linkin Park and call them &quot;goth&quot; so much. Honestly. Just LISTEN to them!! They mine as well have 'POP' tattooed across their foreheads. The musicians aren't that bad, but their singer is horrible. Her voice is grating and annoying, and she is so obviously self-centered (look at their cd cover...). And what kind of name is &quot;Evanescence&quot; for a &quot;goth&quot; band, anyway? Posers.
6305363668|1.0|I'm afraid this movie has been ruined,like George Lucas's 'Star Wars' remake,with the add-ins,that weren't there in the movies first presentation. Even if the voice-over narration is seriously cheesy,the point is that it was there in that period of time,and now has been removed. I purposely give this a one 'star' because of the deletation of the narration,and please get rid of that 'Unicorn',please!
B00000I3JO|5.0|Truly a masterpiece....Perfection that captures the euphoria and despair of love, loss, and hope...Seven beautiful songs...Really requires your full attention...So good that you never play it as background music...As haunting today as it was when released 13 years ago....I have given this disc as a gift many times. It's beauty and impact is indescribable...BUY IT NOW!
B00004Y6NP|5.0|Another great song from the t.v. series 'Miami Vice',(1)'Brothers in arms',a great t.v. series and a great song. This song is played when Don Johnson is driving his black 'Daytona' Ferrari-1973 down the streets of Miami on a moonlighted night.
1567184855|5.0|This book is only for those who have a strong mind, who can read and relate this study with the experience of the seers and sages. For example, the readers may read the book - Autobiography of a Yogi-Paramahansa Yogananda, the chapter on Astral World and see that the description there and the description in this book are pretty similar. Mere reading of the book isnt very helpful. Instead relating this to the writing of sages and understanding the essence helps a lot, especially on the path of spirituality.<BR>But for those with weak mind, or for those who cannot understand the essence, this book can be a nightmare.<BR>Readers may also read the book - Destiny of Souls by Michael Newton to further understand the underlying principles...
B000002J1O|5.0|Beware the remasters really leave a lot to be desired. I have all the Genesis early stuff on cd but just recently acquired a vinyl copy of this album and it is amazing. This remaster was done in &quot;94 so we can all only hope they re-remaster this catalogue so we can all enjoy the beauty of this music that was once enjoyed on vinyl.
B00006M183|5.0|This is a great CD.  There are many awesome guitar solos throughout the album that you can really get into.  It is a mix between Pearl Jam's Vs. and Vitalogy cds.  A Pearl Jam Fan will really enjoy this album and get it value out of the music.  It great I recommend getting it.
B00008H2LB|4.0|After reading some of the previous reviews I was shocked at what I was reading.  Yes the album is short, but do you want 60 minutes of songs with major filler or 36 minutes of awesome songs? I prefer the 36 minutes. Mike Shinoda previously said that Linkin Park had made enough songs for two albums, however, half of them sounded really bad and he didnt' want us to hear them.  That is why Meteora is so short. If you're expecting this cd to change the world and give you some sort of life-changing revelation...then this cd is not for you.  Some complain about the lack of musical growth and maturity in their lyrics.  Yes Linkin Park still has the same sound, but they have evolved.  If you have actually listened to the album, listened to Reanimation and read the liner notes in the 40 page Meteora booklet in the cd you will see that they have matured musically. Nobody's Listening has an awesome flute sample going on, Faint has this great guitar scratch and strings,and Numb has some cool background stuff, etc.  <br />The lyrics are better and more mature than the ones on Hybrid Theory.  The lyrics on Hybrid Theory seemed really general...like you didn't know what they were mad at but they were mad.  The ones on Meteora are more specific and more concise than the ones on Hybrid THeory.  You can see various themes in the lyrics and it gets straight to the oint. Bottom Line: The tracks on Meteora are the best tracks on Hybrid Theory perfected.  So if you liked Hybrid Theory and if you're a fan of Linkin Park, buy the cd. It is worth it.
B00008S2VG|4.0|Don't expect the depth of &quot;Ray of Light&quot; or the breakthrough sounds of &quot;Music&quot;. But if you're looking for a good time -- Madonna-style, this is it. This album is more about experimenting with sounds and words than it is about trying to reinvent the music industry.<br />Furthermore, don't listen to the critics who have bashed Madonna's wordplay or poor rapping skills. For once, take solace in the fact that she realized she was being facetious with her lyrics. She's not being serious, and if you want to enjoy this album, you shouldn't be either.
0792839749|4.0|The scope of this movie is best appreciated in widescreen version. So let me know if MGM will release this title in the original theatrical format.
B00008DDXC|4.0|I've got the books and found the second Harry Potter movie to be much like the first. It's reasonably well done, more so than most adult book/ movie adaptations but still manages to leave some details out. I can't remember all of the book but when Harry and Ron miss the Hogwarts train they do travel to school in the Weasley's family car, just not quite the way the movie does it. Various other details are left out although one or more were actually filmed, you'll find those in the deleted scenes section of the second disc.<BR>The movie may be a little scary to small children but I wasn't particularly bothered by anything other than a case or two of mild swearing.<BR>I found the extras on the second DVD (those I've tried) to actually be improved over the offerings in Sorcerer's Stone. I never could find the deleted scenes in that one, they're easy to find here, not too hard to navigate and no silly games to work your way through first.<BR>Pretty good adaptation, worth having in your Harry Potter collection

B00005JHAB|1.0|Jennifer Lopez is the most overrated, so-called talent of all time. Her acting is even worse than her singing. The day that the public gets sick of seeing her is too soon for me. I love movies, but I'll never walk into a theatre if she is so much as an extra among ten million people seen at a distance of 10,000 miles.
0375414053|3.0|IDKHSDI must be a better book than I thought it was ... any book that reads so simply, yet reads so differently to so many different people, has got to have something going for it.<br />Kate is a woman who thinks she wants to have it all, to have the perfect career and be the perfect wife and mother, and maybe have an affair on the side. In her case, however, all she has is the perfect career (and, oddly for a book of this ilk, most of her success in that is either lucky or sexual).<br />I wanted to like Kate, but it was hard. She was atrocious to her children, despicable to her husband and either rude or kowtowing to everyone else she encountered. Her professional life was filled with completely unprofessional mishaps (sure it was for humor, but still).<br />The differences of opinions in reviews here is amazing. Reviewers think Kate is brilliant; I thought she was at least as goofy as Bridget Jones. People think Richard was lazy; I think he failed to live up to Kate's unspoken expectations. People see their lives in Kate's; I thought her a total caricature of the professional woman and mother. People objected to the ending; I thought it was true to form, as someone like Kate could never really toss it all away.<br />Neither Kate nor many of her reviewers here consider raising your own kids a viable option. Not everyone can, or would if they could, but it's certainly as worthwhile as equity-fund management.<br />This is a generally funny, if repetitive book, slightly plotless. Some excellent observations are made about women in the professional workforce. Lots of corny-but-cute symbolism is thrown in. The reviews here on Amazon, however, are a much better sociological statement than IDKHSDI itself.

B00006AFUR|5.0|I would have missed this one if it had not been for Win MX! I found this CD in a search and tried it.  Wow is all I can say.  This CD has not left my machine.  I have been listening to it over and over.  Even more, I had no idea that it was headed by an actor, Jared Leto.  (Not even familar with his work as an actor.) I think he found a new job here.<br />Spacey rock is what 30 Secs. To Mars is about.  It seems like a trippy, spaced out concept album about the furture and living on Mars.  The songs are brilliant lyrically and musically.  The music goes right through your body and sends shivers through you.  All I can say is that this is one of the most impressive CD's I have heard this year.<br />I bought this gem and reccomend you do too!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is the creator of numerous amazing films. Spirited Away follows the class and charm of such films as Princess Mononoke before it. The characters are detailed and the animation is gorgeous, and the plot is intriguing and well developed. It is an awesome portrayal of the supernatural spirit world, as well as a highlight against gluttony. If you consider yourself an anime fan, this is a must see movie.<BR>   What's more, it must be awesome since it's the only Disney film (sponsored or no) that's ever won an Academy Award.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|the ac/dc remasters are out in force with this remaster of the 1992 double live cd it has all of the songs from the standard 2cd release but you do not get one of the angus dollar bill or the big doule sided poster that came with the standard release but you do get a 16 page booklet describing the time around when the album was released such as pictures of backstage passes and other memorabia from that concert.
B00000JLWW|5.0|The other day I was thinking that, if I would put together all the times I have watched Titanic, I would spend almost three consecutive days in front of the TV. Some may think I'm crazy, some may think I'm a fool, but I want to explain the reasons for watching Titanic over 20 times.<br />In fact, Titanic is more than a simple story. It's three stories sewn together in the same fabric: the story of the gigantic ship and its tragedy, the love story between a poor american boy trying to return to his home and the newly-impovered, high-class, bold british girl, and finally the story of the forgotten treasure hidden under four kilometers of ocean in Titanic's remains.<br />Of course, \\"Titanic\\" should concentrate more on the ship's story. But then we would have a documentary. In my opinion, James Cameron was very intelligent, focusing the attention of the viewers on the water-and-sugar love story between Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet, and the overworked \\"struggle between classes\\" theme, just to mesmerize them with the fantastic technical and historical production related to the sinking-process scenes.<br />Of course, the movie has its flaws, mainly the partly obvious and cliche&eacute;-plenty script, and the slightly below average acting by the main trio diCaprio, Winslet and Billy Zane. But think about it: Titanic's true story was nothing new. Titanic foundered in 1912. The movie was made in 1997. So, when it was released, the true story of  \\"Titanic\\" was 85 years old. I.E., \\"Titanic\\" raised almost US$ 2 BILLION with a story in which EVERYBODY knew what would happen at the end. This must mean something.<br />What I'm trying to say is that there are stories that must be told. I know that some people hate Hollywood's millionaire movie industry, and give all their cheers to independent, low budget, scoreless danish movies. But some stories, some movies, have to be told using a Hundreds-million dollar budget, and \\"Titanic\\" was one of those stories.  I'm not \\"against\\" Hollywood, I'm not \\"against\\" independent low-budget movies. I'm against, fervorously against, for example, a Sylvester Stallone terrible movie that has cost over 50 million dollars (say, \\"Get Carter\\"). I'm against  boring, meaningless independent movies, made famous by Hollywood-hating people that in fact have fun just \\"being against\\" something or other.<br />Movies are meant to be entertainment. To me, each time I watched \\"Titanic\\" I got over 150 minutes of entertainment. That's what I wanted, period.<br />Grade 8.5/10wood, I'm not \\"against\\" independent low-budget movies.

B000062YAZ|2.0|Slayer would be a great band if they just changed a few things about themselves. 1- Getting a lead singer that can actually sing, 2-structure their songs into some kind of organized format, 3-Put more variety into the music.<BR>I first bought this CD b/c like everyone says it's \\"the greatest thrash CD ever!\\" When I opened the case I was HIGHLY disappointed to see that out of the 10 songs on this record, a whopping 8 were under 3 minutes long, and the other 2 were a mere 4 1/2 minutes long. I popped it in just to see \\"well, even though it's short, it might still be good.\\" I was wrong. Sure they play fast as hell, and the guitarist can solo his head off with his lightning fast solo's, unfortunately the whole album feels unsolid, like a melted icecube, everthing just seems to fall everywhere and mix itself up too much. This in turn makes each song sound alike. The vocals are fast, the guitars are fast, the drums are fast, everything is so fast but not really that heavy, like let's say Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets\\" album, where the tempo was slower but songs had structure, it felt like it was going somewhere, and the songs were fuller, more bass. Another problem was the soloing itself. Sure it was fast, but it seems it was just there for the guitarist to boast his talent. The solo's didn't work WITH the music, rather, on top of it. After a chorus was over, the solo would start on top of a repeating riff behind it and stop, then the chorus or next verse would start. The solo's didn't lead into or away from the rest of the music, unlike handfuls of Metallica's music, where Kirk Hammett's solo's follow a structure. Last but not least, on top of everything else, the songs just had no rhythm or melody for that matter whatsoever. Isn't that what makes metal music good? Driving rhythems? Intelligent Melodics? Well, I guess in the world of arrogant metal, melody is for sissy's. I love Metal myself, but more in the talents of Metallica, Opeth, Type-o-Negative, Pantera, Blind Guardian and such. I gave this album 2 stars because even though I disliked it, I thought these guys can definitely play their instruments unlike a whole lot of bands out there, I'd just wish they'd pinpoint their talents and work together as a band, instead of just spreading it all over the place. If the album's half hour length doesn't turn you off, the abstracted noise probably will.
0312263120|5.0|I was introduced to the books of author Dan Brown only three weeks ago, but have quickly absorbed all four of his published works.  It is easy to see why some are comparing the work of Dan Brown and James BeauSeigneur (THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY).  Both Brown and BeauSeigneur deal masterfully with the more mysterious features of religion, politics, and science.  Both bring to light amazing bits of information, which they weave into the intricate patterns of their stories.  Both are highly imaginative and write with a ring of authenticity that makes for a compelling read.  While Brown compresses labyrinthine plots into brief time periods to provide page-turning suspense, BeauSeigneur trilogy is of epic proportion, covering several decades.  While Brown applies the mysteries of history to the drama of \\"today,\\" BeauSeigneur uses both history and prophecy (from perhaps a dozen major world religions) to transport the reader from the world of today, to the very dawning of a new age in a story reminiscent of the scope of Asimov's classic, FOUNDATION. <br />One other difference is that BeauSeigneur has taken the novel (pun intended and forgiveness is asked) approach of including footnotes in his books of fiction.  By doing so, he all but eliminates the necessity of suspending disbelief.  Few authors employ such strong factual grounding as to make footnotes useful, but I believe Brown's work (and his readers) would benefit from BeauSeigneur's innovation.
B00006SFBD|4.0|Definitly their hardest album to date, Deliverance offers up more of what Opeth is known for: Hard hitting music with acoustic interludes and brilliant mix of death growls and melodic vocals. <BR>Now, this record is really kind of iffy at first. By that I mean that upon first listen, you'll probably be telling yourself to try and like this album because you did spend 16 or so bucks on it and you don't want it to go to waste. You couldn't be more wrong. Because this album does take a lot more patience then their previous works. But it's not your fault! Unfortunately the songs on this one are long (around 10-13 or so minutes) and about 50 to 60 percent of this time your listening to hard hitting riffs and death growls, which might I say, aren't Opeths most melodic, but definitely their most technically exhilarating. Not to say I have a problem with Opeths usual lengthy songs, I think it's amazing, but sadly, the long song formula just doesnt seem to work in Opeths favor 100 percent on this album. The problem I had was that I was enjoying the acoustic interludes and clean vocals and basically listening to each song just to get to these parts. The hard parts didn't get me headbanging as much at first as it did on their previous genious albums \\"Blackwater Park\\" or \\"My Arms, Your Hearse.\\" Yet, with time, they'll grow on you, and you'll come to appreciate their complexity and brilliance. Opeth have a strange way of working like that. <BR>I also felt that they should've made some songs shorter then they actually were, for example, track 5 \\"Master's Apprentice\\" is hard at first and great, around 4 or so minutes into the song comes the melodic singing which is AMAZING!!!!! And makes this the best song on the record. This interlude lasts about 3 minutes or so then goes back to playing hard, but you'd wish that last hard part was cut down a significant amount. A lot of the times Opeths songs are good and you don't want them to end, and they don't, but with this one, you'd wishthey'd edited it a little bit more. I can listen to every song on this album though because each one has something great in it I want to hear, I just wish that some of the flab was cut off. <BR>They have one instrumental on this one too, track 4 \\"For Absent Friends,\\" which is definitely one of thier best slow instrumentals, unfortunately, like all thier other great instrumentals, it's short, 2 min. 20 seconds short. <BR>In the end, you'll really have to listen to this one 4 or 5 times before you really get the jist of this record, it takes a lot more patience then previous works but it is worth it for the most part at the end. This is for true Opeth fans only. And as I keep saying before, you MUST hear this band to believe them, BUT start with Blackwater Park, My Arms Your Hearse, or Damnation as opening albums. Starting with this as your first Opeth album will give you a wrong impression of thier sound.

While Brown applies the mysteries of history to the drama of \\"today,\\" BeauSeigneur uses both history and prophecy (from perhaps a dozen major world religions) to transport the reader from the world of today, to the very dawning of a new age in a story reminiscent of the scope of Asimov's classic, FOUNDATION.<br />One other difference is that BeauSeigneur has taken the novel (pun intended and forgiveness is asked) approach of including footnotes in his books of fiction.  By doing so, he all but eliminates the necessity of suspending disbelief.  Few authors employ such strong factual grounding as to make footnotes useful, but I believe Brown's work (and his readers) would benefit from BeauSeigneur's innovation.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I bought this SPECTACULAR album two days ago, it's so amazing! I love it. Fiona Apple has one of the most incredible voices in this world, and her piano playing is spectacular as well. Her songwriting is so personal, and beautiful, and you just fall in love with her once you hear her sing the first song. I love this album!
0671027387|5.0|I was introduced to the books of author Dan Brown only three weeks ago, but have quickly absorbed all four of his published works.  It is easy to see why some are comparing the work of Dan Brown and James BeauSeigneur (THE CHRIST CLONE TRILOGY).  Both Brown and BeauSeigneur deal masterfully with the more mysterious features of religion, politics, and science.  Both bring to light amazing bits of information, which they weave into the intricate patterns of their stories.  Both are highly imaginative and write with a ring of authenticity that makes for a compelling read.  While Brown compresses labyrinthine plots into brief time periods to provide page-turning suspense, BeauSeigneur trilogy is of epic proportion, covering several decades.

B000089RVX|4.0|Where do I begin? My favorite songs are definitely 2 and 4, i listen to them over and over again. All the other songs took me to a different place while reading the lyrics and listening to them at the same time. Indeed the lyrics are powerful, but they are powerful because they evoke such strong emotional reactions to experiences of loss, despair, loneliness, misdirection, tempation, and evils beyond mention. Indeed, Amy saves some of these songs from being completely leaving you in a state of emptiness, but to me they remain quite chilling. One can detect some sense of hope within her voice but it is difficult to concentrate on that while being transported into the abyss through the meaning of the lyrics. Nevertheless, I recommend this album precisely because of the emotion and the noncompliance with the norm and the outstandingly true portrayal of feelings which is admirable and worthy of support. Just don't listen to it if you're feeling depressed on a dark and dreary day because you might find yourself sinking deeper still.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack has grown so much since their first album.  In this album, Godsmack has become more mature.  Shannon Larkin is the new drummer of the band.  You can hear his great skills and power from &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;Straight out of Line.&quot;  Sully's voice has grew stronger.  His performance in &quot;Straight out of line&quot; and &quot;Faceless&quot; was amazing.  There is no bad songs in this album.  All of them rocks.  This is definately a must have CD.
B00003CXBH|4.0|The Mission is a powerful movie with a powerful message about sin, redemption, and love. It probes deep into the evils of the Catholic Church in Spain and Portugal in teh mid 18th century. Robert De Niro brilliantly portrays Rodrigo Mendoza, a dynamic character who transforms his life to a murderer who trades slaves to a Jesuit priest who fights for those seemingly 'enslaved' natives - the Guaranese. Jeremy Irons ixquisitley plays the role of a truly Christ-like figure. Father Gabriel is the epitomy of compassion, lvove, and understanding. With an incredibly written screenplay by Robert  Bolt (who also wrote A Man For All Seasons), the Mission is an incredible film which explores the depths and beauty of morality and life ont he path to Jesus Christ.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|A stunning return of Buckingham/Nicks/Fleetwood/McVie that bristles with dazzling guitar parts, pop hooks, close harmonies, and the rock solid rhythm section for which &quot;Fleetwood Mac&quot; is named.<br />Stand-outs include: Thrown Down, Peacekeeper, Red Rover, Illume, and the title track.  Strongly recommended.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This movie defies all expectations for what an animated movie should be. <BR>The winding plot takes the viewer on a thrill ride of beautiful imagery interwoven with a wonderful story; from peaceful villages to raging battles between human and nature.  This film chronicles the battle between technology and nature and is a must for anyone above the age of 12 brcause of the gore in some scenes.  <BR>Sadly, this movie came out shortly before the Best Animated Feature Award came out in the Oscars because this movie deserves much more recognition than it gets.
B0000639FE|5.0|I love this movie.  I'm writing this review just after I've viewed the movie.  I usually write longer reviews, but I don't feel this movie calls for one.  It's funny, serious, and will definitely leave you feeling good.  The acting is just wonderful, and the three main characters (Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Renee Zelwegger) are all great and memorable (as is the nanny, haha.  Or, &quot;Child Technician&quot;.  Yeah, anyways...).  Buy it, rent it, borrow it, whatever.  Watch this movie.  I don't think you'll regret it.  That's all I wanna say.
B0000844IT|5.0|Army of Darkness has been one of my favorite films since ... well, forever.  I can't believe it took me this long to get it on DVD, but I'm glad I waited, since now I have the &quot;Boomstick&quot; Edition.  Nice to see the &quot;original&quot; ending, but I prefer the theatrical release (sorry, Mr. Raimi) over the director's cut. Such a great movie, though!
B00008PBZW|2.0|John Woo films have always had a tendency to rely more on explosive action sequences than masterful acting to pull the crowds. Face Off was loud but intriguing. M.I. 2 was loud but fairly stylishly done.  Unfortunately, Windtalkers is really just loud.<br />The central plot is actually very good. Two U.S. marines must escort a pair of Navajo Indians who are trained to use a secret code to make transmissions to allies without Japanese troops earwigging. A factual plot too-this really happened. So all the potential was there, but the main problem from my point of view is that this movie was simply overdone.<br />Although the action sequences themselves are well done, nearly all of them are accompanied by dramatic war music which spoils the reality of them. There are also, if you can believe it, too many of them. Great war films like Saving Private Ryan and We Were Soldiers(watch that!) offered respite between the bangs for some thought provoking dialogue. Not so here.<br />The acting is far too over the top. Nicolas Cage is unusually poor, while Christian Slater barely breaks a sweat. I found that I did not care what happened to the characters-NOT a good sign.<br />This movie is a prime example of the fact that explosions cannot make a movie on their own. John Woo has made a good effort, but sadly this movie just did not hold my interest. If you REALLY like war films, you may like this movie, but otherwise, it's not really worth the postage and packaging!<br />ASIN: B00008PBZW
0385335482|1.0|By the time I got to the Chapter where Becky honestly thought she was going to win the lottery and have it solve all her financial problems, I began to wonder what level of intelligence the audience who made this book a best-seller had?  Then I began to wonder what kind of intelligence I had to borrow it from a friend and begin to read it.  That situation wasn't funny.  It was downright annoying.  So much so that even though I assumed this book was supposed to be a fun and carefree read, I was getting more and more ansty as I read on.  Half way through, I slammed it shut with disgust.<br />The character of Becky is annoying, pety, frivolous, irritating and takes the word stupid and naive to a whole new level.  I can't believe that women in the world can relate to her.  If that's the case, I don't hold out much hope for our gender's future.  <br />If you want smart sarcastic chick-lit humour with women who have a brain, go read a Karen Templeton or Sarah Mlynowski book.  Save your money on this one...
0688163173|3.0|Like his work in Mystic River, Lehane once again falls into the trap of the obvious twist in Shutter Island.  With a plot conceit utilized in a recent Oscar-winning film, Lehane sets us up for the big, flip-the-script moment -- but for some reason we feel like we've already seen this before.  Although Lehane's work always had cinematic qualities, it seems as if he's taking his writing cues more and more from Hollywood.  Shutter Island showcases all of Lehane's strengths -- character, dialogue, morality plays -- but it also contains his weakness for sticking in a surprise ending, no matter how unsurpising it actually is.
B000007VCM|4.0|The Cult are quite the enigmatic band, aren't they? Despite roots steeped in Goth as the amalgam of Ian Astbury's old band Southern Death Cult and Billy Duffy's former band Theater of Hate, the Cult's post-DREAMTIME sound seemed to call on a musical influence that even pre-dated Goth. Dare I say it, Metal? No, not the cheesy hair metal of the 80's or death metal or speed metal, but instead the the classic prototypical metal of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Uriah Heap, and of course Led Zeppelin. The path towards this musical direction starts with LOVE. Despite the swirling, heavily echoed & flanged guitar work of Billy Duffy, the trippy lyrics of Ian Astbury, song titles like \\"Nirvana\\", and the paisley-tinged artwork, LOVE is still essentially a heavy rock album. The latest remaster is much more bottom heavy, punchier, and of course LOUDER than the earlier versions. It thus finally comes across as the heavy rock masterpiece that it is. Billy's Gretsch White Falcon through Roland JC-120's of the era sounds more like Billy's Les Paul Custom through Marshall stacks of the Cult's latter era. The original Beggar's Banquet LP and CD masters were a bit thin-sounding, and the Sire-released US version was thinner still. As such, one must have gone to a Cult show live back in 1985 to see that they had much more in common musically with AC/DC than with their compadres Love & Rockets or the Bolshoi. <br />With no shortage of power-chords, among this classic album's highlights are the radio & club faves \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" and \\"Rain\\", and there are treasures like \\"Big Neon Glitter\\" and \\"Phoenix\\". You can tell that the band was just itchin' to totally rock out, but they had to subdue themselves. Why? Was it because of producer Steve Brown, who once produced Wham? Is it mere coincidence that they were finally allowed to rock out to their collective hearts' content on the post-Manor Sessions Rick Rubin -produced ELECTRIC? I think not. I am sure that most die-hard Cult fans, myselfincluded, would have loved for Beggar's Banquet to have included a bonus cut or two from a pool of selections such as \\"Little Face\\", \\"No. 13\\", \\"Assault on Sanctuary\\", All Souls Avenue\\", and \\"Judith\\" just to galvanize these rarities from this era with the album on which they would have appeared if they had made the final cut.<br />LOVE is the first step taken toward the \\"Sonic Temple\\", forward or backward depending on how you look at it. Whether you consider it Goth, neo-psychedelic, or whatever, there's no disputing that LOVE is pure power-chord magic!
B00006V9A0|5.0|Feel lucky to get this blockbuster collection of one of the greatest grunge bands. I was never a grunger until I saw this band un-plugged on MTV.That was a nice recording but this cd has a bit of all their cd's and a bonus track, &quot;You Know You're Right.&quot; I listen to this cd over-and-over and it rattles my soul (or something inside me) everytime. This is definitely 5-stars, once you give it a total listen. Buy this cd now!
6303443214|5.0|After having absolutely no sleep, I saw IWTV at 6:30 in the morning, and put off going to bed just to finish watching this incomparable movie. It is the singular best movie of all time. In a nutshell, Louis de Pointe du Lac, the younger vampire, struggles with regret about his killings after being &quot;made&quot; by Lestat de Lioncourt.  I had heard in advance that Tom Cruise played an excellent Lestat, but when he appeared on the screen, I was shocked. He was a chilling, amazing character, virtually unrecognizable with fangs and blond hair. Louis, played by Brad Pitt, was occasionally whiny and melancholy, but he certainly fit the part. Stealing the show, however, was an extremely talented and extremely frightening Kirsten Dunst (at 12) as Claudia, the child vampire whose mind and soul matures, but whose body remains that of a 12-year-old. Louis's only love, she keeps him with Lestat in the immortal family. Antonio Banderas, as Armand, was also amazing, although a far cry from the auburn-haired, eternally youthful character of the book. I was inspired to read the novel by Anne Rice after finishing the movie, (I cried for hours at its end, partially because it was over) and it too was great. If only Tom Cruise was Lestat in the feeble Queen of the Damned!
069452607X|5.0|Collins analyzes companies that have transformed themselves from good to great and concisely delivers his assessment of the characteristics that have made these companies so successful.

Many companies and organizations that are satisfied being &quot;good&quot; who could be but never aspire to being &quot;great.&quot; I am a sophomore, and after reading this book I am changing my major from Finance to Marketing, because that fits my Hedgehog circle.
0609610570|5.0|EXECUTION appears to be targeted at the most senior leaders at the largest corporations when in fact much of it is applicable to workers and managers at all levels and in organizations of all sizes.  Granted, some of the specifics address issues faced with those at the top of large organizations such as keeping updated on hundreds of vice presidents.<br />For the owner/manager of a smaller business, someone in middle management or someone who just wants to do a great job in their organization, there's a wealth of information.   Job seekers can use a lot of the information, somewhat in reverse, to both showcase their capabilities and to evaluate the effectiveness of the organization that's seeking to hire them.<br />There are numerous examples of real-world challenges and how they were met - sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully.  This information isn't everything one needs to be a successful manager, but it certainly addresses the issues of getting things done from personnel selection, coaching, evaluation and either promoting, moving or removing people.<br />The \\"Letter To A New Leader\\" which concludes the book is not a synopsis, but does touch on many of the key points.

B00004WGC4|5.0|If I had to go to the proverbial desrt island and was only allowed one comedy programme to take with me, it would be &quot;Basil the Rat&quot;. Just the funniest half hour of comedy ever. EVER! The rest of this series is brilliant. An absolute must see. Comedy just doesn't get any better than this series.
B00005JLEU|3.0|Another stunning film by, Hayao Miyazaki, the undisputed master of animation this film suffers from many of the flaws of Princess Mononoke and other masterpieces of Japanese animation: a combination of almost random imagery and shocking leaps between brutality and tenderness and between gravity and silliness. For those comfortable with these features of the genre, this film will stand out as clearly the finest yet made: an essential part of any serious anime collection and easily worth a dozen viewings. However, viewers new to serious anime (we're not talking Speed Racer here) and especially those with young children, should take care: this film, like many of its predecessors (notably Mononoke) contains disturbing images that will not be suitable for all audiences. Moreover, because these images are -- in typical anime fashion -- often dreamily disconnected from any real narrative purpose, they are all the more shocking, especially to those expecting a family animation experience along the lines of Lion King. For the daring though, well worth a try; but be sure to pre-view it before sitting the family in front of it.
0688163173|3.0|I loved Mystic River, but Shutter Island is no Mystic River.  The book reads very quickly, but there's no depth to it, the way there was to Mystic River.  The characters are one-dimensional (and given the fantastic set-up, they have to be).  Bigger themes are raised but not really addresssed, unless it's in a lecture from one character to another.  And finally, the twist at the end broke the narrative thread for me.  It won't have me re-reading the book, looking to see how he did it.  It simply let me down.
6305252521|5.0|Given America's disturbing obsession with reality television, a movie like 1998's \\"The Truman Show\\" couldn't be more relevant.  How far, the film asks, will TV producers go to boost ratings?  And at what expense?  Where's the line between a clever idea and crass opportunism?  Jim Carrey is the title character, who, unbeknownst to him, is living the ultimate reality show.  Cameras are watching and monitoring his every move for the world to see.  The environment in which he lives is 100% fake, right down to his love (Laura Linney) and the sky that stares down at him.  Unlike other reality shows, the subject doesn't know he's being filmed.  Does he ever find out and how?  This smart movie won the attention of many critics, enjoyed some box office success, but was snubbed at many award shows, which were apparently too busy oohing and aahing over a little war movie filmed by Steven Speilberg (hint: the title includes the word \\"Ryan\\").  But it's definitely one of Carrey's best films and it proves that he can do much more than stretch his lanky frame in 1,000 different ways.

B00008PW3Q|1.0|Please, Say You Won't ever release another album.  This is a great example of what happens when a band gets too popular and stops listening to the people that can tell them what will make an album sell.  So many of these songs had the potential to be excellent but they're buried under a ton of effects, over-engineering, monotonous guitar leads and just plain stupid themes.  You could re-edit this CD, cut out about 6-7 songs, simplify the rest and you might have a pretty good album.  Otherwise, it just a self indulgent waste of time.  I was really looking forward to this, but I'm afraid it's going in the drawer.
B00005JKJA|5.0|I won't bother to add to the already monolithic body of glowing reviews of this film; I think it is a masterful work, equivalent to and perhaps surpassing &quot;Blue Velvet&quot; in artistic merit. I am writing mostly because many of those who claim that they hated the film because it &quot;doesn't make sense,&quot; or loved it even though it is &quot;open to interpretation&quot; may not have taken heed of the clues David Lynch included in the DVD sleeve. They clearly reveal the logic of the film to those who take the requisite time to think them through. My review is essentially one giant &quot;spoiler,&quot; so if you haven't seen the film, take heed.      The film most certainly does &quot;make sense&quot; and follows a completely rational and logistically valid plot structure. The film begins with a stylized jitterbug contest behind the opening credits, showing Naomi Watt's character (Diane Selwyn) winning a trip to LA from her native Canada to tryout for a Hollywood production. We then see the suggestion of a sleeping figure (Diane again) in red sheets prior to the start of her dream, which opens with the hypnotic figure of a limosine traveling down a dark road, containing Diane's idealization of her real-life paramour, Camilla Rhodes. In reality, Camilla is Diane's former lesbian lover, who betrayed her by stealing the coveted role in the film Diane unsuccessfully tried out for, and spurned her affections for the director of the film. Diane is so jealous and infuriated that she hires a hitman to kill Camilla; when the two meet to discuss the deal, the hitman says he will leave a blue key on her coffee table to signify that Camilla has been successfully dispatched. The film's dream sequence begins after Diane has received the key, and Diane's fantasies of a happier outcome are manifest in what we see.       In her dream, she is her idealized self, free of insecurities, more innocent and charismatic--nailing her tryout for the film, but explaining &quot;Camilla's&quot; victory by the influence of the mafia (&quot;Camilla&quot; in the dream is replaced by a woman whom the real-life Camilla tauntingly kisses at a party to infuriate Diane). Other characters who represent real-life counterparts also resurface in the dream, in various roles: &quot;Coco,&quot; played by Ann Miller, is actually the film director's mother, the man terrified of the ghoul behind Winkie's is an accomplice of Diane's hired hitman, and the mafiosos played by Dan Hedaya and Angelo Badalamenti were other attendees of the humiliating party where Camilla taunts Diane with news of her engagement to the director. In the dream, Diane refashions her hitman as a bungling idiot who botches Camilla's murder, subsequently leaving Camilla helpless with amnesia for who she is or where she came from so that &quot;Betty,&quot; Diane's counterpart in the dream, can become her heroine, and have a utopian, romantic love affair with her.       Throughout the dream, omens occur that suggest the truth behind Diane's fantasy; the forboding man behind Winkie's, Lee Grant's wacko Cassandra-character with her warnings of trouble, the Cowboy, and the MC at the late-night Cabaret who insists that all is not as it seems. The blue key becomes expressionistically rendered in the dream, and opens the proverbial Pandora's Box, at which time Diane mysteriously disappears from her own dream, leaving Camilla alone to open the box--and then Lynch imposes a couple of his haunting frame shifts, here done with lighting effects, before the Cowboy enters Diane's bedroom, telling her &quot;it's time to wake up, pretty girl.&quot;      Now we see Diane's reality when she awakens, and evidence of her crushing guilt (notice her initial relief when she hallucinates that Camilla has returned from the dead, and her subsequent breakdown when she realizes the truth). Eventually, the gravity of what she has done overwhelms her when she realizes that the police want her for questioning, and the old couple from her dream, whom I presume represent her conscience, are released by the demon behind Winkie's (that is, she loses her sanity). Her demons chase her to her bedroom, where she hysterically grabs a gun from her nightstand, and takes her own life.       Check out Lynch's clues--there's much more to them than what I've included here. He's a master--I don't think he produces a frame of film without agonizing over it for weeks, and I highly doubt someone who produced something as lovingly detailed as this film let any inconsistencies or gaffes slip past him. What a movie this is--I'll never forget it.

B00008OLYN|5.0|I listen to all types of metal...but my favorite metal band is Opeth. They have some acoustic and jazzy type passages mixed in the mist of raw metal. Thats something i always liked in them. When i heard that Damnation was going to be non-metal, i couldn't wait to see the turn out. I like there soft music just as much, if not better than the heavier attributes. Plus, this album sounds really good on my subs. Martin Mendez has some flat out great bass lines on this one. I guess when people ask what kind of music i like, i can't just say metal anymore. I say metal and jazz. I've played this cd over and over again today. Most of the time i mix my cds, but i can't stop playing this one!
B00005JKZT|4.0|\\"The Two Towers\\" is a spectacular looking movie.  The visual effects have surpassed that of \\"Fellowship.\\"  The computer generated Gollum is worth the price of admission alone.  The movie, based on its own merits, is great. <br />However, this movie is based on one of the greatest books of the 20th century, and the liberties that Peter Jackson takes with \\"The Two Towers\\" ultimately detracts from Tolkien's masterpiece.  I understand the constraints of adopting a novel into a movie.  The liberties Jackson took with \\"Fellowship of the Ring\\" were understandable and kept the essence of the novel.  In the sequel, some of the changes were not necessary.  I was very disappointed with the portrayals of Faramir and Treebeard.  In the book, Faramir is portrayed as being more noble than his brother, Boromir.  In the movie, though, Faramir is shown as not being any better than Boromir.  It isn't until after Faramir has already taken Frodo to Gondor (just one of the plot liberties that irked me) does Faramir become the noble man in the book.  Treebeard is my favorite minor character in the trilogy.  Treebread and the Ents are portrayed as being relunctant to fight Saruman and need tricked by one of the Hobbits to fight back.  The Ents in the book need no persuasion.  These and a few other plot diversions left me disappointed with the movie, in regards to the book.<br />\\"The Two Towers\\" is a great movie, don't get me wrong, if you haven't read the book or can forget about it until the movie is over.

B000059RL3|5.0|You might as well get your wallet ready. Even though you can get this album for a bit cheaper, you'll want this version anyway.<br />First off, about the album itself. If you don't own it already...WHY NOT??? \\"What's Going On\\" is up there with \\"Pet Sounds\\" and \\"Sgt. Pepper...\\" as one of the greatest recordings of all time. Marvin tackles the then ongoing Vietnam War, religion, the economy, the enviroment and other personal demons as he created a stunning inter-connected suite of intricately woven, heartfelt songs. Even though the recording is over 30 years old, it could have been released last week. The material is timely and timeless. The music is lushly and lovingly arranged, and stands as one of the greatest performances by the Funk Brothers, Motown's amazing in-house band. Marvin's voice is absolutely at its peak here as well. You hear every bit of his joy and his pain through that immaculate voice. Proof positive that Gaye was one of, if not the best singers to ever grace the planet. <br />But why this version as opposed to all of the other \\"remastered\\" versions that have been previously released? Many reasons. First off, the glorious remaster offered here is the best yet, offering even more clarity and impact sonically (this is the 4th version of this album that I have purchased, including vinyl).<br />Then there's the disc-and-a-half of bonus items offered.<br />The album is presented a second time in it's original \\"Detroit\\" mix, made prior to the actual release mix. There are some minor noticable differences in the songs themselves, but the mix is a little less lush and more immediate. The focus here is the brilliance of the Funk Brothers' original performance. It's about time they got the credit they so desperately deserve. The album ends with an instrumental mix of the title track, with instruments added bit by bit so that the depth of the arrangement is truly revealed. The hero here is bassist James Jamerson, who revolutionized the way the bass is played.Here, you understand why.<br />The second disc contains single mixes and a couple of outtakes, but more importantly it contains a live recording of Marvin and the Funk Brothers performing most of the album and a medley of earlier hits. The recording is raw, the performance was a bit sloppy (nerves and lack of rehersal time), but nonetheless is powerful and astonishing. I can't say much more than that without writing an entire book of praise. Just be prepared to pick your jaw up off of the floor.<br />The words \\"brilliant\\" and \\"masterpiece\\" are thrown around a lot, but here, it is certainly justified. The album stands as Marvin's and Motown's cultural highwater mark. To those who haven't yet heard it, treat yourself to a true gem. You NEED this album. To those who already love it, with this edition you'll find yourself loving it even more. I cannot recommend it enough. A timeless classic lovingly presented in all of its glory, and then some.
6304025831|4.0|Director Martin Scorsese reteams with screenwriter Nicholas Pil-<BR>eggi for this examination of the rise and fall of a Las Vegas ca-<BR>sino run by a slick mafia loan shark (Robert De Niro) and his violent hair trigger partner (Joe Pesci). Although the film is very good and Sharon Stone has good moments with her character, this film is not as excellent as GOODFELLAS (My all time favorite<BR>mob movie) and GOODFELLAS is superior to this film and way better<BR>than CASINO. The first flaw of CASINO is it should've been made by Warner Brothers, which made two other Scorsese mob pictures<BR>MEAN STREETS and GOODFELLAS and if their ever was a collection of<BR>Scorsese films they can add this to those films. Another flaw is<BR>CASINO is not as enthralling and stylish like GOODFELLAS was. Another problem is Joe Pesci's character isn't as wonderful as his Tommy Devito in GOODFELLAS. Despite all this, it is still enjoyable to watch and it's screenplay provides all good details.<BR>I am a real real big big Scorsese fan and has enjoyed all his movies and although CASINO is not my favorite Scorsese film to watch, it is still a good movie even though it is not a timeless<BR>classic like GOODFELLAS, RAGING BULL, and MEAN STREETS, which are<BR>better films. However I do like this one even though it is not a<BR>masterpiece like GOODFELLAS was and GOODFELLAS is a way better movie than CASINO.
B000002UAU|2.0|The opener Sgt. Pepper, is a good song, as the Beatles have decided to copy Jimi Hendix' distortion and style, but it's followed by Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, which is NO psychedelic adventure.<br />We next enter a lull, as Getting Better and Fixing a Hole are weak, as other reviewers (who nevertheless give the album five stars) have noted, but we get a little lift with She's Leaving Home.<br />The album then falls off a cliff with Mr. Kite, Within You Without You, When I'm 64, Lovely Rita and Good Morning.  As other reviewers have noted (but still give the CD 5 stars because it's the Beatles), these are weak tracks.<br />The CD recovers strong with Sgt. Pepper reprise (but its the same basic song) and A Day in the Life.<br />Altogether, not nearly a great CD, but Sgt. Pepper and A day in the Life deserve a star.  Oh well.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Godsmack has done it again. Another brillant album. Everything from the hard edge sound of &quot;Straight Out Of Line&quot; to the mellow tunes of &quot;Serenity&quot;, you will fall in love with this album. It has everything that a rocker wants, and more. It has awesome riffs, amazing solos, and Sully's lyrics are more complexly written. Do yourself a favor. Buy this album you won't regret it.
B00005JL96|3.0|Not nearly as great as expected.. I'm sure it's great for kids, but this is an over 30 reviewer...Yes, technically proficient, but story is nothing special... Get &quot;Spirited Away&quot; instead

B00000FCBC|4.0|I would have given this album 5 stars had it not been for disc 1 which only serves to provide filler songs. Sabbra Cadabra is the only song in disk one I could get into but, honestly Black Sabbath does it better. Sabbath had more fluidity and had a better creative touch. I have all the respect for Kirk but, he's not in the same league as Toni Iommi especially when it comes to doing black sabbath songs. &quot;Turn the page&quot; was a good cover of Bob Segars tune  and i enjoyed metallica's version more  however, It still does not fall into the standard of the raw energy and passion that Metallica's songs are known for. Thank goodness for CD 2 which contains the fast riffs and high octane energy charged songs that we are all accustomed to and for all the critics that want to pigeon hole me into the typical heavy metal fan that isnt open minded, all I have to say is that Metallica is what they are which are the pioneers of metal. I enjoy all rock genres as long as it sounds good and I even enjoyed some of the songs from load and reload however, I was always left with the empty feeling of those albums missing that special element which made their old albums up to sandman great.  <BR>Anyway way I recommend you all get this album for what CD 2 has to offer.
0140187863|3.0|The beauty of belonging to a reading group is that everyone is exposed to books that they might not normally read.  I don't think that I would have considered reading this book except that it was the choice of my book club.     Well, this story was not really what I expected at all.  Constance, Lady Chatterley is a rather likeable person who is trapped in a sad and boring life.  What happens to her and her lover is something neither really anticipated nor expected.  The book starts in 1917 and at the time when it was first published, the subject matter of LADY CHATTERLEY's LOVER was considered to be totally shocking and unacceptable.    Yes, a few parts of the book have rather crude passages, and language, but Lady Chatterley herself is a very sympathetic character.  The style of writing used by D. H. Lawrence is very descriptive and the pace of the story is probably a little slower than modern readers are used to.  Aside from some offensive language, I think that this was a rather interesting, but very depressing book. Many of the characters seemed to be lacking in any kind of a moral code and I found most of the men in the story to be rather despicable.
B00006GO9Q|5.0|\\"In a Silent Way\\" belongs to the most influential and revolutionary albums of all time. Unlike many other jazz albums made in the fabulous sixties, it manages to be revolutionary in the most pleasant and accessible way, a quality only real geniuses can afford. This is a transitional album for Miles. In many ways it continues his works made since mid-sixties with the famous core Quintet (Davis, Hancock, Shorter, Carter, Williams), sometimes extended with guitars and other instruments, sometimes modified (Dave Holland replaced Ron Carter etc). When I think about Miles' long and varied career, I often think about these years as the most creative and intriguing, notwithstanding his great works with Wynton Kelly, Bill Evans and Gill Evans Orchestra. There is some exceptional, cosmic mood here that belongs to this time (compare Pink Floyd's \\"Piper Ate The Gates Of Dawn\\" or Moody Blues \\"In Search Of The Lost Chord\\" and their subsequent albums on the rock side). I think there was some radiating of the era, its social and moral radicalism, countless new trends emerging and flourishing. While experimenting often resulted in excess (free jazz, endless psychedelic jams, many recordings of Zappa or Beefheart) and produced recordings that were popular then but rarely listened to nowadays, these Miles' works are very concise and remain absolutely timeless. Moderately electrified, IASW, continues this path, but also anticipates the new era of Miles - the seventies with its long, improvised, noisy, distorted fusion jams. Many musicians joined here, who later took part in these jams - Corea, Zawinul, McLaughlin. While IASW marked the beginning of the new era, perfectly continued with Bitches Brew or Big Fun, further albums were the way downhill to almost unlistenable on Agharta or Pangaea (1974 and 75 appropriately), last before his 5-year retirement. While technically excellent, these jams seemed chaotic and completely soulless, and were for the seventies the same as long psychedelic dull jams were for the sixties.<BR>IASW consists also of two long jams, but they are exceptionally moody, fresh and high spirited. (Similar atmosphere was created before on \\"Circle In The Round\\" recorded in 1967, also a long, 27 minute-long track).<BR>They consist mostly of quiet, moody soundscapes created by trumpet, electric piano and guitar in forefront, backed by the hypnotizing rhythm section. There are also some funkier fragments in the second track.<BR>These recordings were so great that even Miles could not do it again, although he tried hard. There had to be something exceptional in late sixties (IASW was recorded in 1969) that never occurred again, resulting in so many timeless works of popular art. IASW stands out as one of the greatest, and belongs to the best works of Davis. Must own for any music fan, no matter if you are into rock, jazz, metal or techno. Indispensable!
B00008J2DQ|5.0|This cd i thought was great. Godsmack really came out with a good work. I was never really very much a Godsmack fan i had only heard the song &quot;awake&quot; on the radio so i bought the &quot;Awake cd&quot;, and it made me a godsmack fan, but after this &quot;faceless cd&quot; i am 100% a fan. This cd has really made my list of favs. I would really recomend it to any one even if you are not a fan. I just think that this is a really good work on godsmacks part!!
B000089RVX|5.0|I got this CD as a gift and just wanted to listen to one song, but I let the CD play all the way through and ended up liking the whole CD.  Every song on this album is great.  I no longer just listen to one song, I listen to all of the songs.<BR>I just can't wait till they come out with another album, and hopefully it will be just as good if not better as fallen.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I just discovered this album because I don't do music shows and awards shows. This is so untypical of most music out there and that is why I like it. I love country, jazz, blues and this album melds all those together into something lovely, relaxing and blissful. I find myself humming &quot;come away with me&quot; or &quot;one flight down&quot; all day while working. I can't get them out of my head. As a kindergarten teacher when I play this at school all the girls start humming along and they all tell me their mom has this cd in the van or car. It must be a chick thing because every girlfriend of mine loves it. It is calming and refreshing. I will be giving this as a gift to all who matter to me.
B000028U0Y|5.0|If you know who Jonnny Cash is, or might have heard one of his many songs then you already know his talent. This album is a must for any Cash fans. The &quot;Man In Black&quot; out does himself in this raw live album. even though Johnny was never a inmate at Folsom, after hearing this recording you will think he was. A must buy.
B00008PW3Q|1.0|I turned on the CD player with the anticipation of a child on Christmas morning and my excitement soon turned into disappointment.  There are maybe three songs on the CD that I liked the rest are very abstract with lyrics that are equally out there.  ....
0385504209|5.0|My Mom got me this book for Easter knowing I'm a fan of Arturo Perez-Reverte, Umberto Eco, and other writers of the \\"intellectual thriller\\". A week later, the peanut butter egg is still on the counter, but I've gobbled up the book. Dan Brown has succeeded in creating a rich, exciting, smart thriller more addictive than jelly beans. His characters are tremendously interesting (if a bit cliche), his description of Paris, London and Scotland perfect, and the controversial ideas presented very intriguing. Few thrillers are intellectually stimulating and still very exciting. \\"The DaVinci Code\\" succeeds at both.
B000000OE7|5.0|in 1975 i watched the glory of the band queen come to life before me at at the palace theatre in waterbury, ct. i have been a fan since. it was with great anticipation that i waited for &quot;made in heaven.&quot;<br />it was given to me as a christmas gift, and what a gift! <br />though a somewhat recylced effort the canvas against which this gathering of songs has been given birth is still queen. much of these recordings have been pieced together flawlessly. these songs carry the same warmth and diversity as any others.<br />i have now listened to this recording for 5 or 6 years and it continues to grow on me. a magic came about through vocals, guitars, words, and love of the art.<br />somehow it is fitting that some of the piano lines in the final &quot;it's a beautiful day&quot; make reference to &quot; the seven seas of ryhe.&quot; this was a well thought out treasure and given it ability to age well, it will be a classic.
B000089RVX|5.0|I'd been hearing \\"Bring Me To Life\\" many times on the radio, but I had absolutely no idea of who sang it. Much to my luck, I tuned in to a music channel and saw the last half of the video; let's just say I was thrilled to find out who they were. I quickly downloaded all of their songs in a Peer-to-Peer program and I was ecstatic when I finished hearing all of them. They were so great I went out and bought the cd.<br />This cd is a collection of deep songs that deal with death, suicide, loss, and other topics like the previously mentioned. Amy's voice is sweet and haunting, and will keep you entranced and listening to the cd from beginning to end.<br />For those who debate on wheter it's Christian music, WHO CARES?! Great music is great music; you either like it or you don't. And seeing as many compare it to Lacuna Coil, I'm also downloading that music. As for it being a female Linkin Park? Well, I love Linkin Park, too.<br />One of my favorite songs is \\"Tourniquet\\", that's the so called \\"Christian\\" song. It's about suicide, people! And the possible redemption for ones who commit it. Also, Amy screams \\"I want to die\\" near the end, but it's best heard on headphones. <br />In short, BUY THIS CD! Let me say how incredible it is: if I could only keep a few cds out of my collection (quite nice, I must say), this would definately be in there.
B00008AY3L|1.0|This is the worst music I've heard in at least 2,000 years.
0312305060|5.0|At first I didn't really understand why this book won the Pulitzer, but at second glance it became crystal clear. The characters in the novel were not just characters, they could have been real people, complete with idiosyncracies and random, straying thoughts. Their emotions were fantastically real. I understood exactly how their felt because I have felt the same way. Aside from Cunningham's precise knowledge of the behavior and feelings of people, and of women (quite an extraordinary gift for a man), his prose is seemless and his plot development is unexpected and perfectly timed. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B00005JLXE|5.0|I recommend this movie to anyone who liked the first batman(myself included). That being said, The dark tone taken in this film was refreshing, it wasnt campy and it didnt become silly. (Anyone else remember The CAPT.America and Punisher movie?I know i'm still trying to repress it).It tackled with the core of what makes a hero and when a Hero loses his faith, in himself and his ideals, and to also regain them. To redeem himself. I enjoyed the subtle winks the director took by mentioning former(John romita) and current(Michael Bendis) artists and writers of DareDevil.I liked the the fact that Johnson added scene's from The marvel knights relaunching Cover's into the film, From issue 1 and issue 3.An the subtle Miller story archs that were put into motion. All in all, I liked this film. Anyone who liked DareDevil as a child or adult, An can appreciate liberties taken to put this on screen for the fans.Plus, it's also kind of awesome to see a childhood hero come to life.
B00008AY3L|1.0|No talent.<BR>No life.<BR>No music contained on this album.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I often find it difficult to apprecaite a soundtrack on its own because listening to the soundtrack conjures up the movie, making it tough to listen to on its own.  That being said, this is still a superb soundtrack.<BR>My favorite piece would be &quot;Foundations of Stone,&quot; the music playing as Gandalf and the Balrog are fighting.  Its especially brilliant in the way it changes time from a brisk 4/4 to a broader 3/4 as the two fall our of the cliff and down towards a massive underground lake.  This is not a soundtrack to be passed upon.
0385504209|3.0|I agree with most readers that the book was a real page turner. However, most of the plot was predictable and the author should have spent more time in character development. My big disappointment was the end of the book. After 400 plus pages of build-up I felt let down by the weak ending. Mr. Brown should have spent another 50 pages developing a conclusion as exciting as the story.
0140149295|2.0|I purchased this book, after viewing the much celebrated movie, \\"The Hurricane.\\"  The book is mediocre.  I found it difficult to believe much of the writer's exaggerated boasting regarding his many talents.  I had erroneously gathered from the movie, that this was a self-effacing, self-made man, not so. The reader is ever searching for the \\"real meat\\" of the story, however, the bulk of the story is about the author as a \\"ghetto-bad boy.\\"  The last few chapters of the book are short and quickly race you through the actual murder and trial. Overall it is not well written and disappointing.
B00006LPER|1.0|Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?<BR>The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer.  It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but  incredibly she is an uninteresting one. <BR>A truly disappointing movie.
B00006RIO7|4.0|If you saw the movie and loved the music, buy it! Listening to the soundtrack to the musical is eerily close to seeing the film again, and this one is a very good experience. I subtracted a star for the rap-like tune tacked on at the end - others may enjoy that sort of thing, but I bought this disc because I liked the music in the movie, and rap definitely doesn't fit the era, so it's a real mood-buster. Other than that, this is a great way to enjoy the movie without visiting the theater again.
B00008I8IF|3.0|Yes, this is a very good album, and the Jayhawks are a very enjoyable band.  No, they are not the Byrds, or Buffalo Springfield, or the Flying Burrito Brothers, or CSN, or some of the other seminal bands mentioned in other reviews.  Rather, they're the modern day Poco -- lacking the depth or vision of the aforementioned pioneers, but turning out beautifully crafted, wonderfully hummable little gems of folk-pop featuring strong vocals, tight harmonies, catchy melodies, top-notch musicianship, and disposable lyrics.  Like Poco, too, each of their albums includes some lackluster material.  (Yes, even &quot;Town Hall&quot; and &quot;Green Grass.&quot;)  And I write this as a fan of the Jayhawks and Poco.  Highly enjoyable music, but not essential or life-changing.  For that, you need to turn to Messrs. McGuinn, Crosby, Hillman, Clark, Parsons, and Young.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I don't know much about Cuban music. Like most others I know I got turned on to the Buena Vista Social Club by a friend - in my case someone that knew how much I love &quot;Talking Timbuktu&quot; which is Ry Cooder and Ali Farka Toure playing together. This disc was mentioned on National Public Radio recently and although none of it was played I bought it as a birthday present for someone I thought would enjoy it. He asked to play it immediately after opening it and everyone at the party fell in love with it. The music is so soothing and lively at the same time, so sultry but playful. Technical details..? Who cares? This is music that's just to be enjoyed, not analyzed.
B00008AY3L|1.0|simple math.<BR>simple man.<BR>simple mind.<BR>simply the worst cd I have ever heard.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Rumours it is not. But does it have to be? No. It is what it is and that is an excellent album by a band that proves they can be still relevant in today's pre-packaged pop world. Sure it's a bit long and some songs are a bit quirky but FM have eanrned the right to flex their creative muscles a bit. So you get some quirk but you also get gems like the incredible &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; (when those disco strings come in I get shivers), &quot;Miranda&quot;, &quot;Come&quot;, &quot;Ilume&quot;, &quot;Say You Will&quot;, and &quot;Destiny Rules&quot;. This is a perfect summertime album, put it in and pretend it's 1977.  Put in Tusk or Tango if you miss Christine McVie, put in this album if you just want to hear a great band making great music once again.
0688170528|5.0|This is an exceptional book!  I just could not put it down.  The picture Picoult paints of Chris and Emily is so vivid that you feel you are part of the book.  I was almost sad as I was nearing the last pages of the book since I felt so connected to the story and the characters.  Her writing does an excellent job develping all the characters and the storylines.  It shows all aspects of relationships - friends, lovers, siblings, family, collegues and the emotions one goes through - love, pain, completeness, exhilaration, confusion, anger, guilt, shame, persistence.... I have not read a book this good in a LONG time.
0800179501|5.0|Karate Kid was always my favorite movie when I was about seven or eight, I used to watch it almost every day, well I'm 13 now and my little brother (he's 3) wanted to watch a movie so I went to Hollywood video down the street and saw the &quot;Karate Kid.&quot; I'm thinkin no I won't like it, Its a little kids movie, then I remebered my brother.  He wanted to rent it to I did.  We're watching it and I remember almost every scene, I loved it!  I couldnt believe it, It's my favorite movie now, I bought it on dvd, a MUST BUY for all ages, trust me.
B000002NJS|5.0|\\"Ray of Light\\" is the first step Madonna takes into her third stage of musical growth. \\"Madonna\\", \\"Like A Virgin\\", \\"True Blue\\" and \\"Like a Prayer\\" albums showed off the rebellious and ambitious spirit of an American girl, and in the process creating Madonna's first impression on her fans: rebellion & materialism. Then came along a blatantly, unapologetically sexual experience with \\"Erotica\\" and \\"Bedtime Stories\\" creating yet another impression: sexuality and corporal desire. In \\"Ray of Light\\", Madonna invites us into her spiritual and personal life lyrically and into the realm of electronic and underground sounds musically. This will probably be the most intimate impression that Madonna will ever leave on her fans: spirtuality and consciousness. People relate more to personally intimate lyrics, I believe, than just fluffy and happy ones. I think \\"Ray of Light\\" is Madonna's version of Tori Amos' \\"Little Earthquake\\": Personal, ingenious and classic.<br />Every single track on this album is special, which is something I cannot say about a whole lot of albums out there today. All you need to do is listen to it. You will definitely love it. A Madonna fan or not, this is a must-have for any music fan out there.
B000002LPH|5.0|When you ask anybody to name all the George Harrison albums they know, they might say All Things Must Pass, Living in the Material World, Cloud 9, and Brainwashed. While all of these are classics, anyone who just owns these albums is missing a very vital album. George Harrison's self-titled album is his happiest, featuring an ode to newly-born son \\"Soft Touch.\\" The track \\"Blow Away\\" is one of George's most famous non-hit singles. Even a 1979 acoustic re-working of the Beatles' \\"Not Guilty\\" (first released on Anthology 3, in 1996) is on this set. Your solo Beatle collection is incomplete without this essential record. There's even an LSD-inspired sequel to \\"Here Comes the Sun\\"! Like the album, my review shall close with these encouraging words: \\"Everything you thought is possible if you believe.\\" This album is pure gold.
B00005614N|5.0|This is my favorite jazz CD, even better than Davis's \\"Kind of Blue,\\" Armstrong's \\"Great Chicago Concert,\\" Artie Shaw's \\"Highlights from Self Portrait,\\" Sintra's \\"Songs for Swingin' Lovers,\\" Ella (singing almost anything), and \\"The Complete Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong.\\"  Armstrong's All-Stars with Duke sitting in on piano, playing all Ellington.  Great compositions with great improvisations.<br />Just listen to the five samples Amazon.com provides.  \\"Cottontail\\" opens with consecutive solos by Ellington, the great Barney Bigard, Armstrong, and trombonist Trummy Young, then later features a great scat \\"verse\\" by Armstrong.  Almost every one of the cuts is as strong.    <br />This was the CD that brought clarinetist Barney Bigard to my attention.  He played for years with Ellington's band, then with Armstrong's All-Stars, and I later read in Gary Giddins's \\"Satchmo\\" that Armstrong considered him the best jazz clarinetist he ever worked with.  Listen to his solos on \\"Cottontail\\" (one is in the Amazon.com sample) and \\"Beautiful American\\", as well as his sparkling repartee with Armstrong on \\"In a Mellow Tone.\\"<br />Buy it and enjoy -- over and over.
B00003CX5P|3.0|I didn't really like the story for this Star Wars.  Sure, the special effects are good but the story is really lame. Worst of all are the wooden acting of all the main characters (with exception of Ewan MacGregor, who is always full of life).  It looks like a B-grade movie with A-grade special effects.  I must say that Lord of The Rings are 100X much better!!<br />I gave the special effects the 3-stars point but zero for the plot.  Anyway, I can't stand this movie that I gave away my copy.
B000001Y5J|4.0|BROKEN is worth listening alone just for \\"Last\\" and \\"Happiness In Slavery\\". But there's only eight songs total, and the first six are searated by the last two by 90 one-second blank tracks. Plus, BROKEN and the remix disc FIXED are short enough to be put on one disc. Here's what should be:<br />1. Pinion<br />2. Wish<br />3. Last<br />4. Help Me I Am In Hell<br />5. Happiness In Slavery<br />6. Gave Up<br />7. (You're So) Physical<br />8. Suck<br />9. Gave Up (remix)<br />10. Wish (remix)<br />11. Happiness In Slavery (remix)<br />12. Throw This Away<br />13. Fist F***<br />14. Screaming Slave
B00003CXXJ|4.0|This is a good animation movie for children above 10 years old.  It's also good for adults with a bit of children in their heart. Go and buy it.
B000089RVX|5.0|I really like this album. They have such a great sound. There music has really touched me which is unusual for rock music. They are incredibly talented. I would recommend this album to anyone.
B00005JJX8|5.0|Good story - Excellent Cast - Good Photography - Why can't we have more movies like this?
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. It has to be one of the best pieces of cinema to come out in a very long time. It is so original, captivating, well-written, and directed that there are hardly words to explain just how great it is! Everyone in the cast is perfect in their roles, and the music score is awesome too. The director was very detailed in his creation of the atmosphere and the world in which the characters live. His usage of certain eighties songs was also a huge plus. I love that this film takes place during the eighties. I thought that was pretty cool! Heres the storyline, that I'm sure you already know, but here it goes:<br />Jake Gyllenhaal plays Donnie Darko, a teen suffering from schizophrenia. He sleepwalks, hallucinates, and has a very short temper. He is also seeing a psychiatrist, which he visits during the week to give her updates about how his life has been going, and the things that he has been seeing. His family is very supportive, although he and his sisters tend to fight quite often, but his parents try to communicate with him whenever they can and show him love. His home life isn't that bad, although sometimes, he feels totally alone in the world. Then one night, his life totally changes. He hears a voice calling for him, telling him to wake up. He gets out of bed, and walks towards the door as the voice continues to beckon him. He walks outside to see a man-sized, demonic looking rabbit standing out in the yard. The rabbit tells him that the world is going to end in twenty-eight days, six hours, fourty-two minutes, and twelve seconds. Then, out of nowhere, a plane engine falls out of the sky, and lands right on top of Donnie's house, right where his room would have been, and crashes right through it. No one knows how it got there. All they know is that had Donnie been in his room, he would have died. All of this is very strange, and from there on, the rabbit keeps coming back to Donnie. He shows him visions, makes him do things, and continuously warns him about the future and time travel. You may think I'm giving away too much, but really, I'm not. This is ONLY the beginning. There is so much to this film. It is simply amazing. You have to see it. Then you have to see it again, and again, and again. The ending is a big surprise. Everything in this film ties together perfectly.<br />A friend got me the DVD for Christmas last year, and it is excellent. It has so many awesome special features. Listen to the actor/director commentary. It explains things, and helps to tie up loose ends. Actually, there are no loose ends in this film. Everything is there for a specific purpose. This movie is so deep. I'd reccommend visiting the website ... also.<br />GREAT FILM! I LOVE IT! GO RENT IT, OR BETTER YET, BUY IT BECAUSE YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!
B000021XR5|5.0|STP continue their greatness on thier 4th effort.  Hard and soft, its like two albums in one.  This album takes a step in a more creative direction that is continued on their 5th album Shangri-La Dee Da.  I Got You and Atlanta are probably the best written songs on the album, but the rest are awesome in themselves.  When you hear Down in concert you will be hooked.
0553103547|5.0|This series is one of the best written fantasy series now out.  I have read three of the four books, and I have to make time to read the last one soon.  I read book two in one straight reading binge, and considering it was summer, and I was in college...  This book has plot development that tops even Jordan's early books.  Martin is adept at keeping the story moving.  Like other reviews I end up not knowing who to cheer for.  Such books remind me of real life because at times I am not so sure if I cheer for myself or abhore myself.  Great book!
B000002IZ4|5.0|STP proves itself to be above all others, and this album is no accpetion to that.  There are no weak songs on this album, and I listen to it religiously still almost 10 years after it came out.  All of the hits are great, Interstate Love Song, Vasoline, and Big Empty, but the other songs could all be singles in themselves.  The best song on the Album and possibly my favorite song of all time is Still Remains.  Once you see these guys live, you will know they are the real deal, but this album will win you over none the less.

B00005V3Z4|2.0|I was hoping for something engaging and entertaining but that is not what I got. They should call it Donnie Dull. Sure the acting was good. The storyline was offbeat as well, but a good portion of it just did not keep me interested. I am personally getting pretty tired of movies where most of the characters are depressing. There were afew laughs but if I want laughs I will just watch the Marx Brothers. I doubt if I will recomend this to anyone. I kept looking at my watch wondering when it was going to end. It sure takes a long time to get to the point, but maybe that was the point?
B00008CLOA|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon?  Yeah...Listening to this albam is like being on the Dark Side of the Moon in a very good way.  One words sums up this album.  CLASSIC.  A must have for any music lover and if a so called \\"Pink Floyd Fan\\" doesn't have this record THAY SHOULD BE SHOT.  This record is by far one of Floyd's best.  Way better then Roger Water's Wall and Final Cut.
B000005H7D|5.0|While many people feel this is not John Coltrane's best album, I disagree; this is one of the best jazz ALBUMS of all time. This album combines the whole package: author, artist and band leader, and is not coincidentally also one of the best Blue Note records ever. Either way you see it, it's an absolutely monumental work of undeniable genius. <BR>   The remastering is very good, surpassing even the Mobile Fidelity (&quot;Ultradisk II&quot;) version in terms of overall clarity, if not warmth. The additional mixed media features are interesting (particularly the live video from a Miles Davis appearance), but inconsequential in comparison to the music.
B00008DDXC|3.0|Movie in itself was fabulous, in fact I own it.  However, it missed some key points from the book...anyone else miss the whole Ginny Weasley character development part of the movie, I know I did--oh and there was the whole Colin Creevy's Harry Potter fan club that was entirely not present.  Umm why weren't some of the 20+ deleted scenes in the movie??<br />Movie by itself great, movie compared to book not so great
B00000F0D1|4.0|I particularly enjoy one scene in &quot;Misery,&quot; in which the crazed fan of a successful author switches from kind, gentle woman to crazy lunatic after she reads his latest novel in his line of Misery books, about an inspirational woman from the 1800s. The fan finds out he has killed her favorite fictional character off. &quot;You dirty birdy!&quot; she yells. Right here lies the strength in &quot;Misery&quot;: its ability to take a good novel and turn it into a great film, by deep characters with waves of emotions and excellent lines of dialogue. <br />Kathy Bates is the crazed fan of James Caan's fluent writer, Paul Sheldon, who has finally ended his Misery series. In the beginning, we see him telling Lauren Bacall that Misery has ruined his life. He has been type-cast, not able to write anything but Misery novels. So he has killed her off in his latest book, and set to work on a new novel, &quot;Untitled&quot; (which, in the novel Misery--the REAL novel--is named &quot;Fast Cars&quot;). <br />Paul retreats to a cabin in the middle of nowhere, writes his new novel with a sense of joy, and checks out of the cabin he is staying in. On the way home to the big city, unproduced novel in hand, he crashes off the edge of a ravine and flips his car. This is credited to both the winter storm and his drunkness from a bottle of Dom Periogne.<br />He awakens days later to find himself in the care of Annie Wilkes (Bates). Everything is nice and dandy at first. Annie is a nice enough person. She tells him the roads are closed and the telephone lines are down, but she will take him to town when they clear up. She says she has called Paul's agent and has told his agent where he is. <br />But soon Paul realizes he is trapped in the house with a madwoman. She is nice one second, a lunatic the next. And the best thing about this is how well Kathy Bates carries the character.<br />I read the novel &quot;Misery&quot; by Stephen King. It is the only book of his I have read that Ihave enjoyed. (I hate his other work.) And something tells me that King thought of this idea of a writer trapped with a crazy fan because he himself is an author, most likely adorned with letters signed by mad fans every day. But would his fans be crazy enough to kidnap King, abuse him when he's bad, and make him suffer endlessly? The fan, thinking, in the fan's deranged mind, that they are serving God? <br />So King wrote about this idea, and Rob Reiner turned it into a film a coupl'a years later. I personally enjoy the film a bit more than the novel.<br />In the book, I imagined Kathy Bates the whole time as Annie Wilkes. Only I didn't imagine Kathy Bates herself, but rather the woman Kathy Bates plays. You see, Kathy Bates doesn't play Kathy Bates here. Kathy Bates plays Annie Wilkes.  She steals the show. She completely evelops her character. She easily switches her moods as if there is an on and off switch.<br />I cannot imagine anyone for the role of Annie other than Kathy Bates herself.<br />&quot;Misery&quot; is at times humorous, at times amusing, at times scary, and at times truly appalling; but it is always an excellent thriller. Reiner spotted the potential in the book in 1989, and he immediately went to work on the film for a 1990 release. In fact, I can imagine Rob Reiner scrolling through King's novel, fascinated by every page, wanting to turn it into a blockbuster film with big stars and big thrills. <br />And then I can imagine Rob Reiner at the premiere of &quot;Misery.&quot; I can see the credits rolling. And I can see him smiling.
0529064847|4.0|I love this translation of the Bible.  In addition to the Scripture, this particular edition has a list of Popes, Parables in Chronological Order, Miracles in Chronological Order, and a preface to the Bible. It also has a lot of footnotes which are very helpful to the average reader.  The only drawback is that it contains no maps or other study guides, and the print is fairly small; but for the price it can't be beat.
B00008S2VG|5.0|Well I for one, although my two cents aren't necessarily worth much, positively ADORE this latest album by Madonna. I think the music, melodies, hooks, phrasing, beats, production, and her voice are just impeccable...it is everything I had hoped this album would be, and more. \\"Music\\" was a disappointment for me because, after the lush sound of Ray of Light, it seemed very disjointed and more a collection of singles than an album. However, fortunately on this album, Madonna and Mirwais stick it out throughout the album, and as a result, the album as a whole flows much better than its predecessor. Although Ray of Light has indeed stood the test of time and was, until the release of American Life, her best album of all time, it is my belief that \\"American Life\\" surpasses the genius that was Ray of Light. I think Madonna opens up much more with this album, and I think it is a deeper look into the psyche of Madonna than ROL. Hopefully I'll have the same sentiments in five years... <br />For me, the first three songs are really entertaining to listen to all together. Her vocals in the first two songs are much more the Madonna of old than what we've been hearing lately. Wonderful. I particularly like Hollywood (Sheryl Crow-esque) and I think, contrary to popular opinion apparently, that I'm so stupid is a great song. It's a sort of more in your face sounding track and it reminds me of the Madonna days of yore when she would never pull a video because she might offend people. But that's all in the past, and this is the present and future of Madonna's career. <br />I love her use of guitar and her naked voice on this album. Songs like Nothing Fails, Love Profusion, and X-static process are brilliant partly because of the honesty of Madonna's lyrics, but mostly because of the risks she is taking with her music. Madonna has always been about flash and image, but now she is sort of stripping down the barriers and finding herself, and that fact is revealed in the stripped down sound of the majority of this album. Her sound veers more towards Joni Mitchell than the Kylie sounding contemporary hits she generally releases. I love Mirwais's vocals on the beautiful Love Profusion, and Xstatic process is possibly the most touching ballad I've ever heard. I cried upon my first listen. Easy Ride is sheer genius, continuing the strings of Die another day into a beautiful ballad and ending from a sporadic mess of vocal and strings to a lovely melancholic final chord. Nothing fails in particular is a glorious peak for her career. If this song is not released it will be an even greater travesty than Impressive Instant. The choir in particular raises this song to a level unparalleled by any other Madonna single that I can think of. Superb. <br />I LOVE Mother and Father, the part with \\"I've got to give it up, find someone to love me\\" has been incessantly stuck in my head for days now, and overall is one of the more catchy songs she's done in the last decade. I think Die another day makes a lot more sense as a part of this album, and in context, it is a really slamming track. The strings and lyrics really fit the mood and add to the atmosphere Madonna has created. <br />I think that although ROL was an intensely personal album, but I believe that it was just the precursor to this one. This is the album Madonna was born to make. Every single song is brimming with emotion and Madonna baring her soul for the entire world to see. The fact that she manages to say what she's thinking in a way that keeps you humming the tunes over and over again in your head is just a small part of what makes her, and this album, so wonderful. I love every track on this album, and I think it's an encouraging sign that the fans opinions on what the next single should be are so diverse. That's always a good sign for an album. <br />But regardless of how this album and the singles from it perform on the charts, I absolutely adore it, and I am endlessly grateful to Madonna for going with her instincts and producing a semi \\"underground\\" (well relatively compared to everything else on the pop charts right now) album that isn't necessarily the best decision marketing-wise, but in the end will give her more credit as a musician, performer, singer, superstar, writer, producer, and most importantly, human who is realizing after a lifetime of trial and error, that nothing is what it seems. But at least we've been with her along the way, and maybe a select few in our current society will take her example, and follow their own paths rather than like sheep follow the beck and call of what is popular at the time but never leads to happiness. I dream of the day when American Life will again be about freedom of speech and religion and the freedom to be yourself (the very standards Madonna lives by), rather than repression of individuality for the safety of conformity.
B0000691U1|5.0|As a big band leader, Duke Ellington was unmatched. In this album, matched with two of the greatest instrumentalists of their era, he absolutely shines on piano. <BR> Possibly one of the most overlooked trio recordings of the 60's, this is an absolute essential for fans of any of the individual artists here.
B000002I2M|1.0|This album is so bad, it's almost worth owning. Track after plodding track astonishes. When I listen to this album, I feel intensely sorry for the other members of The Doors. An obviously inebriated Jimbo sounds like he couldn't decide whether to throw up or to go to sleep, so instead he went to the studio and cut some tracks. His vocals are shockingly [bad] and painfully off-key. He actually SOUNDS fat! Seriously...check it out! To make matters worse, at least half of the tunes sound like Morrison made up the abysmal lyrics as he went along. There are a couple tunes where apparently the other Doors managed to get their fearless leader semi-sobered up or at least convinced him to come up with some [bad]lyrics in advance (Riders on the Storm being the best of these), but they are the exception. Mostly the tunes are lazy, generic blues variations that a below-average bar band would be ashamed to call their own. And Morrison turns in the least convincing &quot;blues&quot; vocals this side of Eric Clapton's From The Cradle (yikes!)! This is bad, bad stuff. That said, it's pretty [] funny if you have a perverse enough sense of humor, and it's a great party album if your friends have a similar sense of humor. I guess nothing's all bad.
