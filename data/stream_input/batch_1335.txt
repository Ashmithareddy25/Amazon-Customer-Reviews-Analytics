B00356CO1E|5.0|*PERSONAL:  Back in my junior year of high school, I lost 40 pounds using an elliptical and a couple of fitness DVDs on and off. Close to two years later, I have gained back 20 of these pounds and I felt my self esteem plummet to even worse than before I originally lost the weight. All of my clothes were getting tight and some of them I couldn't squeeze into at all anymore.  I  have plans to join the Army in a few months, but I must first lose another 40 pounds before I am able to go to boot camp. I have never seen Biggest Loser and I had never heard of Jillian Michaels before now, but I blindly selected this workout to help me prepare and I am SO GLAD I DID. Seriously. I would marry Jilian if I could!  *RESULTS:  Day 1: 185 pounds  Day 30: 173 pounds  (Along with this workout, I also walked 4 miles a day and included a low-calorie diet. I would have lost more, but I cheat on the weekends and that always puts me back a pound or two :/ ) Unfortunately, I did not think to take any measurements beforehand, but I am back into fitting in my old pants from when I originally lost the weight. I was doing MOSTLY LEVEL 1 for the 30 days and SOME of LEVEL 2, for the past couple of days.  *LEVEL 1:  I am a beginner in pretty much everything so working up to the next level has been a challenge. I absolutely LOVE this workout. I am so glad to cut the crap and do a high-level workout that focuses on abs, arms, and legs. And over time, I have definitely seen a huge improvement in my stamina. For the past week, I've been using heavier weights to change the difficulty. I still follow the beginner modifications for many of the moves (mostly strength), but a couple of days ago, I felt the need to bump it up for level 2.  *LEVEL 2:  I am in LOVE with Level 2. I have decently strong legs (I do the intermediate workouts for level 1 cardio and leg strength), but my arms and abs are completely WEAK. Level 2 features a LOT of plank exercises, which absolutely kill me. I can't do one plank exercise without stopping. But the fact that I can't do it only pushes me further. The Army does a lot of arm and ab work and I know I MUST master these moves, so I am very happy to keep doing it every day. I plan on working on Level 2 for the next month and I am so excited to see myself get stronger.  *REPETITION PROBLEMS:  I get bored of DVD workouts VERY easily. Even walking by myself every day has begun to be very boring and I have to figure out different ways to keep myself motivated. But I did NOT have any problem with doing Shred in 30 almost every day. After a few times of doing Level 1, I started watching TV and listening to Jilian's voice in the background. I'll probably have to start doing the same soon for Level 2. It's hard as hell and I can feel it working; that is more than enough motivation for me to keep doing Shred in 30 every day.
0374275637|3.0|A very good review of the subject. It separates our intuitive thought from our reasoning ability. There are some findings that seem surprising until you give them some serious thought.  My main objection is that the book is quite repetitive. The author seems to go over and over the same or very closely related material.  It reads like a scientific paper that has been expanded into book form.

B006RED4GA|2.0|This film had good intentions, really it did. It's not like those typical horror films of present day, which tend to rely on hyper-gore or sadism to make you cringe. This one clearly wants to spook you, old-fashioned style, and it makes a real attempt to develop its characters, its atmosphere and the suspense before the big payoff. Unfortunately, it does all these things so poorly that it fails on every level, at least for this reviewer. The characters here are so poorly written, I don't know where to start. This movie is about 95% attempting-to-be-witty-dialogue, so how is it possible that after all that talking, I still don't understand what makes them tick? These aren't believable people, they are caricatures of themselves and we never really get to know them on a human level. The pacing of the story (or lack thereof) and editing between shots is tedious and aimless; I started to feel like I was working the 3am shift at this hotel. And as for the last act? A completely underwhelming payoff that relies on genre cliches, and anyways it comes as too little too late. I'd lost interest by then... in the characters, in the ghosts, in why any of this was happening. The fact that nothing is explained after all is said and done is fitting... I'm not even sure the director knows.  This feels like a student film. Which would be fine, if it were a school project. This movie feels like an afterthought, as some semblance of a feeling that the writer/director had but never really took the time to flesh out. The fact that this is $10 to rent should make your choice easy... skip this one.

B0000DJZA5|5.0|I have to admit I like listening to this album.  Even the Rock songs on this have a beaten-down, wearied mellowness to them that make it decent bedtime music after all.  I wish they would give George Harrison's first album, All Things Must Pass (also produced by Phil Spector), the stripped-down, Naked treatment.  It's the Beatles; any new product or retreatment is better than nothing.

0670520713|5.0|Published in 1937, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a novella written by Nobel Prize-winner, John Steinbeck. It received \\"some\\" controversy on the subject of euthanasia, but was still well received by the public.<br /><br />George Milton and Lennie Small are migrant workers during the Great Depression. George is a witty, intelligent man who looks after his giant counterpart, Lennie.<br /><br />Lennie is a kind, mentally handicapped man who has an obsession for stroking soft things. But because of his size, he possesses super-human strength and cannot control it.<br /><br />The story begins with the characters fleeing the town of \\"Weed,\\" California where Lennie was accused of rape for touching a woman's soft dress. Both men share a dream of owning their own homestead. George wants to be his own man and Lennie dreams of holding and tending to his own rabbits.<br /><br />The following is my favorite part of the story:<br /><br />  'George looked sharply at him. \\"What'd you take outa that pocket?\\"<br />  \\"Ain't a thing in my pocket,\\" Lennie said cleverly.<br />  \\"I know there ain't. You got it in your hand - hidin' it!\\"<br />  \\"I ain't got nothin', George. Honest.\\"<br />  \\"Come on, give it here.\\"<br />  Lennie held his closed hand away from George's direction.<br />  \\"It's on'y a mouse, George.\\"<br />  \\"A mouse? A live mouse?\\"<br />  \\"Uh-uh. Jus' a dead mouse, George. I didn't kill it. Honest! I found it. I found it dead.\\"<br />  \\"Give it here! said George.<br />  \\"Aw, leave me have it, George.\\"<br />  \\"GIVE IT HERE!\\"<br />  Lennie's closed hand slowly obeyed. George took the mouse and threw it across the pool to the other side, among the brush.<br />  \\"What you want of a dead mouse anyways?\\"<br />  \\"I could pet it with my thumb while we walked along,\\" said Lennie.<br />  \\"Well, you ain't pettin' no mice while you walk with me!\\" '<br /><br />Being hired on a ranch, they soon find themselves intimidated by Curley, a pugnacious man with a massive inferiority complex who immediately takes a dislike to Lennie because of his size.<br /><br />During the course of the story, Curley's wife becomes infatuated with Lennie. She is a provocative, but lonely woman who flirts with the ranch hands to fulfill her dreams of becoming a movie star. One night, Curley comes to the bunkhouse and starts taunting Lennie. Lennie takes the abuse until George gives him permission to defend himself and he crushes Curley's hand.<br /><br />Later, One of the ranch hands, Candy, offers to help George with the money to buy their farm if he can help tend to it too. George agrees that it is a plausible idea and they are ecstatic as their dreams of freedom are about to come true.<br /><br />Leaving Lennie behind, George and Candy ride into town to purchase their land.<br /><br />When Lennie is given a puppy, he can't abstain from holding it and accidentally kills it by petting it too hard. At this time, Curley's wife enters the stable to be alone with him. She finds out that Lennie's passion for life is stroking soft things, then offers to let him stroke her soft hair. She grows frightened when Lennie won't stop and realizes she is powerless against the untamed strength of this extremely large man.<br /><br />She begins to scream.<br /><br />In a panic to make her stop screaming, Lennie accidentally breaks her neck.<br /><br />When George and Candy return from town, they find an unstoppable lynch mob has formed and is searching for Lennie. George is heartbroken by this tragic turn of events and must make a life altering decision concerning the fate of his friend.<br /><br />This is genuinely a true to life story by John Steinbeck, and below is a statement made by him in an interview in the New York Times in 1937:<br /><br />\\"I was a bindlestiff myself for quite a spell. I worked in the same country that the story is laid in. The characters are composites to a certain extent. Lennie was a real person. He's in an insane asylum in California right now. I worked alongside him formany weeks. He didn't kill a girl. He killed a ranch foreman. Got sore because the boss had fired his pal and stuck a pitchfork right through his stomach. I hate to tell you how many times I saw him do it. We couldn't stop him until it was too late.\\"e to tell you how many times I saw him do it. We couldn't stop him until it was too late.\\"

1594203059|1.0|This work can not be written by the same author of \\"The pity of war\\". It's a little chronological pamphlet on the glory of the British Empire, an anti-catholic leaflet, and an anti-German brochure. Off course we are aware that the German occupation of Namibia was violent and cruel, but we are also aware that the British Empire caused the death by famine of 750,000 Irish. That British forces are responsible for the death of 10 million Chinese during the first Opium War and of an other 300,000 during the second one and of 115,000 deaths during the Boxer Rebellion. We are also aware that the British forces are responsible for the death of 50,000 Kikuyu during the Mau Mau revolt in Kenya. British Forces are responsible as well for the death of 28,000 White settlers women and children exterminated in the British Concentration Camps during the Boer War. But the British Empire was also behind the death of 10 million Indians during the Great Bengal Famine (1769-1770) and an other estimated 10 million during the Indian Mutiny. Not bad as image of British Civilisation.

B005FVFWOI|4.0|I'm following up all the 40th anniversary remastered versions executed by Steve Wilson. His trademark is to improve the details and clarity of the original recordings without doing any harm to the original. So no unnecessary compression and equalizing have been used ! However, mr Wilson's achievement is not the best so far, probably due to the rather poor quality of the original recording back in 71.  Please pay attention to his 40th anniversary remaster achievements of Lizard and in the court of by King Crimson !  You won't believe your ears.  The second disc of this Tull album does not add much to the first one and could be skipped as far as I'm concerned.  I'm looking forward to new Steve Wilson material such as the Yes Album e.g. !  keep up the good work Steve !

1455510319|2.0|When did Michael (Mickey) Haller become Mexican?  I have read the three previous books and, obviously i missed something, but his physical description or ethnicity is not overly highlighted.  Yet, in this book he has to tell us that his Mother is Mexican in the opening chapter and indeed, he has auch a hispanic appearance that the first client we meet wonders why he needs a Spanish Translator at all.  Why would an author highlight such particulars about a character, especially when there is a movie out there with the character now having a face and appearance that people will associate when they read the books?  It is probably a small matter but I wonder, why?
B005GSY23M|5.0|Drive is hands-down my favorite film of the year; it gave me chills upon my first viewing. The same thing happened with the soundtrack. It's an absolutely mindblowing collection of songs, I couldn't resist buying it as soon as the movie ended. Oh My Love really pushed me over the edge with its perfect use within what will surely be viewed as one of the most iconic scenes in modern cinema for years to come. The use of mellow, ambient electronic music throughout the film was a very welcome touch, and meshed with the tone very well. I heartily suggest the soundtrack, as well as the film, for everybody (except for, in the case of the film, those easily upset by gore and some nudity.)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the game is fun and has a many games to choose from. also has the challenge to make you wanting more.

I'm hopeful on thus one, &amp; *love* some of its features (color coding, difficulty accidentally deleting emails, app not deleting emails on its own, etc). And it looks great!<br /><br />My Q is, why does the preprogrammed signature say &quot;Please excuse my brevity&quot;? Does K9 Mail only allow for short email messages (which will not work for me at all). Anybody out there who can answer this here?<br /><br />Thanks for a great app...

B001HN6922|1.0|My 6-year old son liked the first Cars movie, loves Tow-mater, and couldn't really pay attention to this and fell asleep. Not because he was tired, because it didn't make much sense to him, and I don't blame him.  I got kind of angry, because its a shame to spend money on such a lousy movie, and have the precious time with a young wasted on this. I'm also shocked that Pixar would put together such a lousy movie.  My main criticisms are:  - My 6-year old, Pixar loving son completely did not enjoy it - so what's the point?  - Too many plot points and lines that reference James Bond, etc. that will go over a kid's head. See, the Incredibles, for how to write lines for both kids and adults so both enjoy it. See Cars 2 for too many essential lines being over a young kid's head. Aarff.  - The sweetness and simplicity of the Cars story get replaced by ... a jumbled mess of a plot.  - Parts of it feel like a mini-ad for Ethanol. Well, there may be merit to that (or there may not), but I don't really see the point of putting that in a movie for 6-year olds. There is plenty of time for the crappy reality of big business, subsidies, rent-seeking, politics, etc. later in life. Why the heck inject that into happy family time with a 6-year old?  - And so on.  This one will age badly. I really don't understand those who rated this highly. I enjoy James Bond, I enjoyed Cars. This supposed blend of the two was not enjoyed by myself, by the kid, or other adults.  Take your kid outside and play ball with them instead, or find a card game to play, if you are tempted to buy this. You both will be happier for the choice.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Now my kindle has the super-hero costume it deserves!!!  This is a great case. The fit is very precise and the material is very good quality, well designed, and durable.  It far exceeded my expectations.  It is a skin but better than any other I have seen.  It has hard plastic snap-in case back but plastic has soft touch of rubber or soft vinyl and it is lined with thin very fine felt. There are no sharp edges and all are finished but cover and felt lays completely flat over screen protecting it entirely.  I also like that when you open cover and bend cover flap around the back of kindle the felt protects the table surface on which it lays.   I also got a glossy screen protector.

B0041KKYEM|2.0|Every girl wants to be a ballerina. Yeesh.  This is the female version of The Wrestler, another Darren Aronofsky story arc of love, hate and masochistic self destruction.  Yawn.  Just as they hand out 3D glasses to watch Avatar, Zoloft should be mandatory for every Aronofsky screening. It's a downer, but knowing that from the get-go, there's little to interest besides the sex scene. The acting is good, but Mila Kunis is the real gem here. I said it after Closer and I still believe it today - Natalie Portman is not much of an actress. She peaked with The Professional. She has a cute face, but carries no dramatic weight. Isn't that what we have Sandra Bullock for?  Here would be a twist for Aronofsky, recast the Natalie Portman role with Mickey Rourke. Now we got something interesting going.  \\"First rule of Ballerina Club IS, you do not talk about Ballerina Club!\\"

B001CS2TFS|2.0|No, the two stars are not for the remaster. I don't even care if it was remastered or not -a great performance on a hissy wax record is still great, and a bad one on the latest digital equipment is still bad. I really think the album is mediocre.  ELP always played classical-rock fusion or whatever you want to call it. It is a fact that Emerson was technically superior to the vast majority of rock musicians. But he was still a mediocre classical player. Knowing I will attract the hate of all the rock fams here, the average level of the rock musician is a million times lower than a good, solid, classically trained player. So what passes for \\"spectacular\\" in the rock world is ho-hum in classical.  And then it's the composing skills. Save for a small loan from Bach, this thing was entirely composed by ELP (mostly by E). And it's mostly terrible. Yes, the opening sequence of the Tarkus suite is a good idea. And that's pretty much it. The rest is pretentious garbage. A good deal of it sounds improvised, which is ok for many rock bands, except this one is supposedly above the average. And if the \\"improvised\\" parts were thoroughly written, well, then the composer sucks big time.  In the 1980s a few prog rock bands turned \\"commercial\\". Funny thing is, some of them actually improved quite a bit, such as Genesis. ELP folded right at the end of the 70s and all of their attempted comebacks crashed badly. There must be a reason why. And it's not that modern audiences cannot appreciate their \\"classical\\" sound. No doubt modern audiences consume a lot of crap, but they can also smell old crap.

B0052U59F4|5.0|I (the wife of Jason) just finished reading the third book in the Fifty Shades Trilogy and LOVED all of them.  I was more than completely satisfied by these books!  It is the content that makes it so powerful and amazing. There is nothing innocent about it and James rarely holds back details for the reader.  I am sad to have finished reading the three books.  I am tempted to read them again.  They created characters that are hard to forget and will probably stay with you forever.  I am always hesitant to finish a book because I am usually disappointed by the ending but James has succeeded in creating a lasting, memorable and most importantly happy ending.  I begged her in an email to write a fourth book!  I LOVED the Fifty Shades Trilogy and would highly recommend it to everyone!

1423140591|5.0|I must admit, I was quite disappointed when I read the first Heroes of Olympus book, but it left me excited to read this one. I have read all the percy jackson books and the lost hero. The percy jackson books were much better, but the lost hero wasn't bad. This one was so much better, though. I was hesitant about reading it because the first one in the heroes of olympus series was such a disappointment to my expectations, but I was wrong. This is an amazing book. Percy loses his memory and has to find out who and what he is, and there are even some amazing twists along the way, especially the one with Leo. Rick Riorden is so talented with all of his books and makes them amazing. I love how he makes percy jackson really develop as a character because if he didn't, percy wouldn't seem like a sixteen year old. It makes sure the original readers of the series don't feel left behind as they age and percy doesn't.
B000002WFF|5.0|Great CD.  I thought it was supposed to be a 2 CD set of the whole movie,  not 12 songs. Plus only a few songs are live.
B004X80QNG|3.0|This is the perfect organizer. By far the best I have found. However, there is no widget. If it had a widget that was just as good, then it would get 5 stars.
B005CW5E3E|3.0|the boys from texas are still at it.  i particularly like their rendition of honky tonk and dust my broom
B004TTMYQG|4.0|The calender is okay. It is not as intuitive to scroll months as I would like. It also does not have an integrated todo list.  It had a fantastic widget set. By far the best I've seen in a calender program.
B001B85QG8|5.0|The Used's first official album covers a wide variety of styles. Most of the songs on the album are actually followed by a song of a very similar style (e.g. bulimic & say days ago, blue and yellow & greener with the scenery, noise and kisses & on my own, etc.), and the sound of the album does not hold them back from succeeding at these distinct styles. The sound of the album is also superb. To me this is their best album so far, but their other albums are my other most favorite albums as well.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is a fantastic program for high school and college students in any math class. However it goes above and beyond that into answering everything. Topics aren't as complete as what you find in Wikipedia, but the natural language search is great. It has changed the way search is being thought of. Just look at Siri that contains code from this project. If nothing else I purchase out just to support the projects development.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I got this hoping to make my kindle fire look like a classy book...and it does just that...I love the look, the feel, the smell...I just love this cover
B004T5K3OK|5.0|I use this program all the time. It saves me from having to go to a scanner. I scan the docs immediately and put them in my dropbox account. I then have full access where ever I may need it.  On a wish list, I wish it had a way of faxing and I wish the paper recognition was better. All in all a fantastic program worth the money.
0439023521|3.0|Everyone around me has been talking about this book and I finally got a chance to read it.  I burned through it in less than a weekend, but I found myself wanting to like it more than I actually did.  The plot went extremely fast (and normally I read quite slow), but to me there was no depth to the story.  Each revelation the main character had seemed forced to me.  I felt like I was constantly being told this or that fact was important,  or the main character felt this way without the prose actually making me *feel* that way.  It was just too much telling and not enough showing.  Also, the dialogue throughout (epsecially between Peeta and Katniss) felt so stilted and rang very untrue to me.  Often sentences were confusing and sometimes scenes transitioned so quickly it was confusing I had to read over a passage a few times.  (It seemed on more than one occasion that Katniss had spent her last arrow, when in the next scene she was reloading her bow.)  There was even a typo in my copy.  ***SPOILERS***  I was expecting a more literary story (i.e. more thematic symbols--more could've been done with the mockingjay pin and the fire symbology, both missed opportunities on Collins's part.  The ending was a pure cop out: more could've been done to push the characters to their absolute limits and examine how far one really would go for survival.  It seems counterintuitive to say so, but there were so many cop outs in this plot, so many \\"deus ex machinas\\", that I grew frustrated with the believability of the plot.  Just when things seemed to get really juicy, the diffcult option was removed from Katniss's (and Peeta's) choice of options--every time she was in a position to have to kill a character she cared about, some outside force came in and killed them off.  (Rue, Thresh, Foxface.  Even Cato's death was more of a mercy killing.)  Imagine how profound the story would've been if she had to have allied with Rue and then have been forced to kill her in cold blood later on.  That's exactly what I was expecting when I started reading this book--I couldn't imagine it any other way than that she'd bond with the other children and then be forced to kill them, and then deal with those emotions.  Instead she got off the hook emotionally each time, and the story just felt flat to me because of it.  I really wanted the story to push her to her psychological limits in addition to physical limits.  She just made out too easily for a dystopian story centered around kids killing each other.  If she had been forced to kill Peeta, the story would've had some real weight to it.  (Though I suspect he's been kept alive mostly to set up a love triangle in the next book.)  The \\"stay tuned for Book Two!\\" ending only added to the frustration.  There is just no comparison to 1984 or The Giver, stories with real emotional weight, philosophical ideas, and more artfully-crafted prose.  I suppose the trend now is to have supposedly \\"dark\\" stories that are only dark in regards to action and plot, but lack any true psychological weight, and whose characters act coolly under pressure (except for a few obligatory tears) and emerge from the story unscathed in any profound sense.  (Who can forget Winston turning into coward at the end of 1984 and how his character is broken as a result?)  All in all, I feel this book had nothing to say about humanity.  There were glimmers of a theme, especially from the mouth of Peeta when he talks about dying his own terms, and when Katniss makes her first kill--but those themes are dealt with so briefly and then it's back to the action.  Peeta and Katniss feel more superficial towards the end of the story--I can't get any real sense of how they've changed after the Hunger Games, if at all.  We are only told in the exposition that Katniss feels different, but we are never quite shown how.  Same goes throughout the book--we are told some things are significant, but without any backstory, we can't feel how important they are.  Why is Katniss's decorating Rue's body with flowers such an act of defiance?  We are told after the fact that communication between Districts is forbidden.  Had we been told (or better yet, shown) that *beforehand*, the scene would've played differently.  There were just too many examples of events happening, then being told they were important after the fact.  Considering this is a best-seller, I was really surprised at the low quality of the writing style, even in regards to such basic things as scene transitions.  There were also a few elements that just seemed thrown in--like the muttations, that took more away from the story than added to it.  And must every YA book these days be written in first-person present tense?  A real disappointment and missed opportunity.  I really wanted it to be better after all the good things I heard about it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is a great game but some of the games are challenging. but they are still very fun and exciting
B0063GORYU|4.0|Fun, mindless game to quickly burn through lots of time.  Glad to have this for those appointments when I have to wait.
B006671NPM|5.0|For me this is the best movie of the entire sequel and obviously the possibility of watching it in a 3-D format increases the entire experience.
B0068183EA|5.0|This is one of those books that I would not recommend anyone read in one sitting: maybe it's just me, but as soon as I tried to read more than one chapter at a time my brain started begging for mercy, turning into cream cheese, and dripping out through my ears... not an experience I would recommend to anyone ;)  That said, taken in in small chunks, Orzel's book does magically manage to make quantum physics somewhat comprehensible (I'm not sure I have the right kind of brain to grasp it completely: see cream cheese issue above), interesting, and frequently funny. Some of the weirdnesses of quantum physics are explained in such a way as to demonstrate the sheer strangeness of how matter behaves at quantum level (regarding the behaviour of waves, the squirrel maths was both amusing and helpful!), and Emmy the dog is an irresistible protagonist in the journey.  I suspect some background in the subject would be tremendously helpful, but as a reasonably intelligent but not scientifically trained individual with no maths or physicas beyond GCSE level, I more or less followed along and learned a great deal along the way... I was amused and delighted to find, when watching [[ASIN:B004S6E91S Big Bang Theory - Season 1-4 Complete [DVD]]], that I have certainly retained some things as I understood a good deal more than I used to. I dare say I will learn more with re-reading! Very enjoyable, and highly recommended.
0062082353|5.0|This is like no other account of the personal side of what a Navy Seal sacrifices for his country both on a professional and personal level. You have no idea until you read this book what it was really like serving as a Seal in Iraq. Chris Kyle's autobiography puts a whole new perspective on what it takes to keep America free.  Also, his wife Taya deserves a lot of credit for enduring the pain and anxiety of being away from Chris for so long while he was serving his country and the dangerous job he had.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I don't usually read a lot of reviews before I read a book, because it can spoil it for me.  I saw this was a popular book, but that's it.  It captivated me and started to take on a creepy tone after awhile. Not nighttime reading toward the end.  The ending was a bit of a disappointment to me.  It seemed jumbled and lacked credibility to a certain extent.  All in all, I think it was a good read though. Didn't buy. Ended up borrowing this from the library.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I had not seen this movie in some time so when I got this sent to me I was excited to see it again and to share it for the first time with my girls. The Blu-ray version of this movie was just remarkable. The colors and sounds just jump off the screen and you get drawn into the true love story which is Lady and the Tramp. On top of a great story there is also some great music shared in this movie too which is a hidden gem within the film. With talent such as Peggy Lee you can see that Disney had the pulse on their audience in trying to draw in the younger crowds back in the day. All-in-all though, this is definitely a movie that you should add to your collection or reintroduce your family too, you will not be disappointed!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is and awesome game.  I love it. you can do any thin on it. does any one else like it?
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This was a great collection on one Blu-ray/DVD. I had seen the Phantom at the Fox Theater in Detroit when it first came out many years ago and have been a fan ever since. Now, I have a new generation in my own family which I would like to share this with. My daughters are both starting to enjoy the music, sights and sounds of broadway and I am so excited to share with them some of the amazing performances that are in store for them if they so choose to take them in. This Blu-Ray provided me a great way to share another great musical with them form the comfort of my own home. My girls simply loved the music and the performance. I was impressed to see how well done the Blu-ray was and the sights and sounds were not lost on the video itself so it was like I was sitting in the audience. All-in-all, if you are a fan of musical or simply the Phantom of the Opera, this is definitely a must have for your collection!

0765365278|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite writers, and I have read and enjoyed most, if not all, of his other books.  However, nothing prepared me for the gem of The Way of Kings!  It makes other books look like child's play.  Once I read the book, I immediately had to go read it again.  I cannot recall any other book I have had that feeling about immediately upon finishing.  Which became problematic, because I had to share with my son who also wanted to read the book.  He was similarly impressed.  After he finished, for several days we would just look at each other and say, \\"Best book ever!'  The only disappointment with The Ways of Kings is that we have to wait so long for Book 2.  In the meantime, I will just have to entertain myself with the final book of The Wheel of Time, which is another Sanderson work I look forward to reading.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great if you are just looking for something to pass the time. These games are fun and good for just kicking back and wasting time.
0345522478|5.0|Kudos to the work of Kevin Hearne!  Fortune favored me when I quite accidentally discovered this book at a service plaza on the Ohio Turnpike.  Action and humor abound as appealing characters face daunting challenges.  I would put this book in the vein of The Dresden Files, so if you like Dresden, you will most likely like Atticus.  I've also read the other books in this series, and I look forward to reading more of Hearne's work in the future.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|only played for a couple of days now but so far i like most of the games. it could be better but its cool for when I'm bored.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover.  Looks like a real book not just another black leather case!  I read the reviews and glad I wasn't scared off by people saying it was too stiff or that it is too hard to put into the case or that it takes to long for the cover to \\"fit\\" to the Fire.  I just kept it face down and the cover fit to the Fire within a few days.  It is beautiful!
B003YL4LW0|4.0|This bok is the original book on this very well known tail about Dr. Jekyll and his evil alter ego Mr Hyde.  This book gives a very psychological version of the story and less focused on the actual killing portion. The first part of this book is a little long but the story gets better until the end where everythins is divulged.

140053271X|1.0|I enjoyed the original Nook. I thought this would be a great device, especially since it received such positive responses from reviewers on several sites.<br /><br />I've had the Nook (3 of them, actually) and am returning it before my 14 day window is up.<br /><br />First, the buttons are annoying to use. I like having the option to tap the screen, but I'd rather keep it as clean and clear as possible. Simply hard to press the buttons down. They don't seem to be getting any easier after finishing a book.<br /><br />Second, and most importantly, is the contrast and quality of the screen. Different letters are darker than others on every page, within words, and they change every time I go to the next page and back. I thought it might have just been something weird with the files, or formatting, so I played around and did the troubleshooting. Nope. It's just horrible to look at.<br /><br />After having 3 with the same problem, I'm going to just send it back. No need to go through that cycle and then be stuck dealing with the awful customer service. It's too bad; I really wanted to support Barnes and Noble by using their reader.<br /><br />Note: I put this review on the B&N site, and they removed it for somehow violating their terms. Well, okay then.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Must have CD/DVD in every music collection. I would definitely recommend this DVD. The RAH is perfect hall for such great singer.  Great production, great band, great Adele!!!
B004HO6I2E|2.0|After seeing the previews several times I decided this was a movie I looked forward to seeing. Sadly, it wasn't all that great and here's why...<br /><br />1. I usually like this type of movie, but does every other word need to be an \\"F\\" bomb? I don't mind the occasional use of swears for humor purposes, but they lose all meaning when overused. That was definitely the case here.<br />2. I expected it to be funny. Admittedly, there were a few scenes that made me laugh, but not many. There were several opportunities to poke fun at things, but this movie sadly missed the mark.<br />3. It almost seemed like they tried to go for a bizarre Hangover 'WTF' type of funny at some places. In my opinion it didn't work and should have been either removed altogether or rethought.<br /><br />Would I recommend people watch this movie? If you have an hour and a half to waste or nothing better to do I would say go for it. Otherwise, it probably isn't worth it.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|A very good, wholesome movie.  Of course if you are a horse-lover like I am, the movie was great just because it was about a horse.  The movie was well put together and just made you feel good to watch.  Once in a while it is good to watch a \\"cheer for the good guy\\" type movie not to mention you were watching the story about a real life history maker.  People don't realize that you were watching about a sports hero every bit as outstanding as Joe Montana, or Michael Jordan or any other athlete.  Very enjoyable.
0441013597|5.0|I had watched the motion picture based on this novel years ago, not really enjoying the dark, sadistic overtone the movie conveyed.  Needless to say I was a bit skeptical when I started reading Mr. Herbert's magnum opus.  Please allow me to say the obvious.  This book is wonderful, brilliant, and thought-provoking!  The mental imagery that I experienced while reading was so much more fantastical compared to David Lynch's vision.  I shared the hatred for the Harkonnens just as the Atreides family felt, I was in awe of the amazing supernatural capabilities Paul gained as he aged to a man in the Arrakis deserts.  However, as the story came to it's crescendo at the end I was left feeling lost, confused, and wondering \\"now what?\\"  This may end with Paul's success as Emperor but, as a woman, I felt a bit slighted that his true love Chani was almost pushed aside since she felt she didn't matter any longer. I suppose I need to read the next book. I do recommend this to anyone who has a love for a good story.  This may be a science-fiction work but it reads just as well as any classic novel.  Case in point, don't watch a movie and think the original is just as bad.  Read the book!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I liked the beginning of the game. it doesn't work very good on my kindle fire. I have enjoyed it for the most part.
B005HV6Y5W|1.0|UPDATE: I rented this BD from flix because it got a Best Picture nomination from the Academy Awards, as well as Directing (blurrph!) and Cinematography (some good camera work here, but doesn't redeem the flick). I do not know what the nominators were drinking when they picked this movie, but I sure would like a liter of that booze!!!<br /><br />I'd actually give it a MINUS FIVE STARS (-5*) if that were possible. Do not, under any circumstances buy this until you at least rent it!<br /><br />This movie is nae Scottish! Until now I thought no movie other than 2001: A Space Odyssey could absolutely bore me to death, but at least that movie had some good movie for part of its waaay-too-long 148-minute time (it's actually great right up to the point where it goes into a psychedelic trip that still hasn't stopped!). This movie had nothing but mid-1960-style BS from start to finish. Plus, I had to man the remote for most of it to adjust the volume up to try and hear the whispering words and then immediately way down to stop the room from shaking with the absurd soundtrack. BTW: don't bother about volume, just leave it at the level you can safely hear... the whispering words are nea Scottish too! Better yet, don't bother viewing it!

0525478817|5.0|I have named this review as I have as a nod to the characters' struggle to overcome the obstacles that cancer places in the way of their relationship with each other, with their families, and with themselves.  It could also be a description of John Green's success in overcoming self-inflicted wounds in the course of describing the relationship of Hazel and Augustus, 17 year old cancer survivors as we meet them.  The practical knee-knocker is the ability of the kids to embark on international travel to pursue a plot point thanks to the most well-funded, least curious, \\"Make a Wish\\"-type organization known to man.  Augustus calls them \\"the genies\\" and as they provide the assistance of a \\"machina ex dues\\" perhaps this is a good name.<br /><br />  However the biggest obstacle to the suspension of disbelief is the ability of these kids to speak in flowing, existential monologues and dialogues that sound as though they had been crafted, practiced, and examined for days.  No teen - not even preturnaturally bright, only-child, cancer warriors, can talk like this.<br /><br />  So why 5 stars?  Because I fell in love with Augustus and Hazel and cared about them.  Whether or not what they said was authentic for their age, it was authentic for humans in that situation.  They spoke not just of fear and pain and unknowing, but also of questions that we all ask about our purpose and direction and destination.  The characters were in love and so the readers love them too.  Not a technically masterful book but a wonderful read.<br /><br />April 27, 2012.  I have read the book twice more since this review was initially posted.  I am very far past \\"young adult\\" but the characters inhabited my heart again just as they did the first time i read it.  What I said above about the language not being authentic for teens is still correct but what i have decided is that the dialogue is how teens - or at least these teens - should talk.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I am astounded by the negative reviews I've read here concerning this Marware case. I logged on just now to purchase one for my daughter who previously bought a different case... more expensive and made of leather, but lacking CORNER protection. I have taken my Kindle Fire in the Marware case EVERYWHERE... Europe, Russia, third world countries, and all over North America.... in and out of planes, airports, taxis and hotels... I have dropped it 3 times that I recall from a standing position to the floor and it has saved the Kindle from damage every time... I carry it in the back pocket of my jeans, the inner breast pocket of my jackets and coats, throw it in the console of my car and truck, and occasionally toss it into a saddle bag while riding my horse... Seriously, this has to be the best case imagineable for the Kindle Fire. Ignore the negative reviews... they are wrong.

1400069181|5.0|I bought this book in BN as the impressive text on the cover - \\"With every book you purchase, a new book will be provided to a child in need. One for One.\\" caught my eye. But, I did not know TOMS at that time. And, now I am glad I read this book. It gives you a different and whole new perspective on for-profit charity or building a business by incorporating social responsibility in its DNA. This book is very inspiring, short, simple and contradicting to the well-known \\"Think Big and Kick Ass\\" approach. In Blake's view the idea - \\"The only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.\\" is out of date and out of gas - interesting enough. But, what I am wondering is - how much does it cost to produce and market a pair of TOMS and what is the mark-up? Is this transparent? If not, TOMS must have been making great profits too, in which case the \\"Giving\\" and the \\"Social responsibility\\" elements are being used as good marketing tools? I will try to find out these answers. But, it is a good book and I enjoyed reading it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love it. I like the fact that I have more than one version to choose from. Easy to navigate through out the app.

B006WT2TZC|5.0|Having just discovered Scorpions since, oh about last month, this is a great finish to their final original work, 'Sting in the Tail,' and bookend to a storied career.  I have already heard most of their earlier works, and - wow what did I miss!?!?!?  I decided to take a chance on 'Comeblack' and was not disappointed.  'Comeblack' contains remakes of seven of their signature works and six well-known covers.  However, do not let that deter you from at least a sampling.  Every track is high-quality, veteran but yet, not stale - a fresh second-take - it is worth taking at least a once-over.  All the covers hold up well to the original standards yet each has the Scorps stamp.  The hard-rock/heavy metal spin on \\"Tainted Love\\" gives a Brit-pop classic a fun, almost head-banger's feel.  \\"Ruby Tuesday\\" is an incredible ode to the Stones.  Sonically, the mix is superb (though I am no audiophile and have idea what one even listens for).  Performance-wise, Scorps still deliver: Klaus Meine does not let up the power throughout his range even with the larger-than-life tweeter voice, and the guitars and drums thrash and burn with fury and technical precision.  The ballads are as artful and powerful as ever.  Auf Wiedersehen Scorps ... Too bad you were you gone before I had a chance to see you in concert!

B000JQU1VS|5.0|The Holmes character we see in advertising is often reduced to a charicature, and the same could be said of recent movies which are energetic, eye catching but really miss the point Doyle was making. Holmes outwitted his opponents. He used his brain. He created the concept of a detective as a methodical, tenacious stalker. So, if you've never read through the original works, you should make the time. You'll see that Holmes is not just brilliant, but also solitary, and a drug abuser (cocaine). Doyle was making him human. Enjoy these wonderful tales.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Purchased this item after Christmas for my Fire.  Shipping was very fast and product was very well constructed.  Although I do not carry my Fire around much I always keep the cover closed to protect from accidents.  Very happy with product would recommend to anyone.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I was hesistant to buy this set but seeing how it was Xbox and PS3 compatible I decided to try it out.  The sound is wonderful and the audio controls are great! Game sound really shines along with the Bass option. The chat sound is somewhat lacking with chat sounds not being fully heard and sometimes the pickup on my end is delayed a little too much to where the first thing I say is cut off.  Ive only had the headset for a month now and have put in about 12 hours game time on it but I will say that the materials with which it was built do seem a little on the cheaper side. I havent experienced any breaking but I hope the material holds up, others have commented that theirs broke but I think as long as you take care of it and aren't too rough with the headset then it will last.  Its a greatheadset for the price and for the cross compatbility with both consoles and PC. I would not recommend it for someone who games all day everyday or that will just toss a headset to the side when they are done because I do not think the material will hold up to the wear and tear of a frequent of abusive user.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great case! Nice and thin yet protects greatly. Easy to hold and doesn't leave fingerprints as long as your fingers aren't super greasy. Overall above satisfactory! I would definitely suggest this case to anybody who gets a Kindle Fire.

0811875555|5.0|O livro é muito bom. Tem vários desenhos a lápis do Gleen Keane, diversas pinturas digitais e esquemas de mapas e texturas que serviram como referência para o filme. O resultado final da animação em 3D ficou bem parecido com esses fragmentos de concepção de arte mostrada no livro.

0062082353|5.0|Wow.  Its weird to think about how one man has affected the history of the country.  Chris has single handedly taken out more badguys than anyone else, and by him taking out those guys he's changed the course of history.  Amazing.  Highly, Highly recommended.
B005F3XV62|4.0|Decent plot and story line.  I think he makes the right choice in the end.  a good presentation make you believe the animals are really talking.  Job well done.
B00406UK5A|3.0|I'm surprised that director Neil Marshall who hails from Newcastle upon Tyne, through which Hadrian's Wall ran, should get the movie's historical facts so wrong.  Tha Gaelic spoken in the film is Irish which was never a language of the Brythonic Celtic tribes of AD 117.  The Picts were just one of many ancient British tribes around then and those well south of what is now Highland Scotland spoke a language similar to ancient Welsh.  The film is, therefore, historically inept.  Reading some of reviews here suggests the writers think thay have learned some history.  Well I'm sorry but it's tosh!  Visually and sonically the film has many good points but it doesn't overcome my concerns.

B005LAIIS0|4.0|The Grey<br /> Review<br /><br />A man named John Otway works in the Alaskan Wilderness as a protector of an oil drilling team from Wolves. He pens a letter to his wife, then gets on a plane, which crashes and he ends up in the wilderness with other men fighting for his life and the lives around him.<br /><br />Liam Nesson is one of the older generation's overlooked actors. He is an actor that can take on any role and nail it. He is so method and so intense in his acting ability, he can carry any film that he is in with it. He is remarkable to watch and makes me actually want to go to see the film that he potentially is in.  But in this film, he could've turned in a one-note performance and just chewed scenery, but he turns in a haunting, moving performance that made me weep for his character towards the end.  You get that feeling in your gut after watching the men walk through the wilderness and you just know. Also you feel for the character after getting to know him through out the movie.  Not a lot of actors have that hold on the audience like he does.<br /><br />Joe Carnahan is a pretty prolific director that has his hits (Smoking Aces), huge misses (A Team) and critically overlooked (Narc). I was worried that he would underwhelm yet again on this one because A Team didn't come out that great and I was disappointed, but I was glad I saw this movie because this movie takes the talent he has shown in Narc and brings it to a another level of solid film-making. The look, pace of the film are really good and made me enjoy the movie even more because with certain directors the material in this film would've or could've been mishandled, but he did it fine. In fact, this could be his masterpiece because it moved me to the point because at the point before I saw it, I had low expectations. I am glad it didn't turn out to be the ACTION FEST TO END ALL ACTION FEST movie the trailer made it out to be.  Everything is just well rounded here, but it does have its flaws.<br /><br />First flaw is that the side characters that worked with Nesson's character barely had time to get their story. I know there is a 2-hour time limit and there could've been more expanded from the story on those characters because in the last scene, I really didn't feel for them as much as I did Nesson's character because that is basically the main character development that we had in the movie, but the rest not so much.<br /><br />Yes, I did read there was a lack of an ending, but how do you end a movie like this? It's hard to sit at your computer and go, \\"Ok, let's end it this way or that way.\\" That's not how it works. Some open endings are perfect for some movies, and this movie had a good open ending to make you think on what was going to happen to the character after the film ended.  Plus, I feel some other reviewers missed the theme and the message of the movie to the point where they are making blind criticisms without digesting the film, but you don't have to like everything.<br /><br />Overall, it was a enjoyable movie and a great thrill ride like the reviews said it was, it had the right amounts of all the stuff that movies are made up of, but there was a lack of some parts that didn't make the movie less enjoyable, but still were there to see.that worked with Nesson's character barely had time to get their story.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|After looking at several different models of Kindle Fire covers, I settled on this one and am really satisfied with my choice.  I think it has the best features all around: a hard protective backing, clip-in body, and the ability to stand the device upright.  Initially I was going to choose the Leather Case Cover (also by Marware, but the price was a bit too high and some reviews said that the case didn't allow for all three upright levels to work)  Putting my Kindle into this cover was very easy and it fits securely. The elastic is good, too - I don't think there's a chance of it breaking on me for a long, long time to come. You don't have to stretch it very much to put it over the cover, it just slips on easily. So it gets relatively little wear.  The cover looks pretty nice. The edge of the cover fits right into the groove. It stood up well the first time I tried it and I think it will get better over time as the spine becomes less stiff. The inside of the cover is soft -- which is great for the screen -- but does attract little fuzzies and lint. I just take a lint roller to it every so often. Not a big deal.  The case doesn't add very much bulk to the device -- just enough to keep it protected.  Over all, great product! I wish it came in more colors, but out of the ones available I like the black one the best. Good value.
B003Y5H574|5.0|This is Steve Carrell at his best and Ryan Gosling in a different kind of role. Steve Carrell is, as always, fun, but there is a serious side to this movie as well. Taking each other for granted and the problems that can bring, is a something this movie addresses. It also shows the frustration fathers feel in wanting the best for their daughters. The language and situations are definitely not for children.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I didn't really like the way they ended this as I thought Harry was a lot smarter and wouldn't have destroyed some of the things he destroys here; I also always hoped they bring Dumbledore back; that they had somehow faked his death to fool Voldemort but you can't have everything you want.  At least they closed out the story lines and let you see who ended up with who and that the magical world went on to the next generation; perhaps to open a new line, who knows.  All in all a great series of movies.  A must have for all Harry Potter Fans.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once you start reading this first book, it will be hard to put down any of the series. The concept of these Hunger Games is barbaric, but the author Suzanne does an excellent job describing things in a way so that they are not gruesome at all. She is an excellent author that will keep you awake at 4am reading this book. Its a great story about families who help each other, and a spin on the traditional love story. I'm in love with this series, and wish the auhor would write more.This book is a necessity.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Of course the movie is perfect! Woody Allen at his finest...and with someone in \\"his\\" role who is much more visually appealing! If you're a Paris nut/Francophile, you will love the wonderful shots of Paris, night and day...it so made me want to go back. It's very entertaining, clever, witty, and sharp.  The quality of the DVD is poor. I sent my first one back, thinking it must be that one. The light was very yellow, casting a yellow tinge over everything, making it look like film and not real. So disappointing. When the replacement arrived, alas!, it was the same poor lighting, yellow cast. I got used to it after awhile, but it was not at all the quality of the original movie.
B005GT3XGS|5.0|This series consistently puts out!  Great.  If you've never watched this show and are simply looking for  advice on tv shows to buy on dvd to watch, you can't go wrong with this one.  It has been great from season one until today.
B005FITIGO|5.0|Great movie with great acting.  Balanced approach to the very testy subject of Wall Street and TARP.  Educational for those who don't dabble in the Market.
B000JIHP88|1.0|Looks so cute and it promises so much, so for the price it sounds like an amazing deal. I wish it worked. Ours was dead out of the box. Took the time to put it together, put the batteries in and...nothing! Took it apart, put it back together checking each step 10 times to make sure we didn't make an error...finally tried it again with another set of batteries. It never worked: never turned on, never made a sound. Very bad quality.
B001HN6918|4.0|I really like the story line here and the opening it creates for future release.  If you liked the original movie this one shouldn't disappoint, lots of action and suprises in how our hero finally wins the day.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is very simple and perfect for the Kindle Fire. The elastic band is easy to stretch around the cover in open or closed positions. Although I have only used the cover in the upright display mode, that seems to work well. It could use a few other color choices, but I ended up with black anyways.

145162445X|5.0|Read it thoroughly, learned a ton, it was a great book!  Can't wait to see what else this author releases!
0062119044|4.0|At first I was put off by this book's story-written-as-letters narrative, but it didn't take to get caught up in the story itself, with a feeling of such building dread that I found myself reading it far into the night, unable to put it down. Heartbreaking and frightening at the same time, I don't know if I have the guts to watch the movie! I might have to wait until I can rent it, so I can watch it while peeking out from under the covers.
0316067601|5.0|This was an excellent read.  He spends a lot of time going thru the SEAL training but that is effective in showing the reader how difficult it really is and how tough these warriors really are.  The fight and subsequent running battle with the terrorists was something I couldn't put down.  I was amazed at the Afghan acceptance and defense of Marcus.  It's good to know that we are doing some good over there for the citizens persecuted by the terrorists and the people don't all hate us.
B004LWZW4M|4.0|I liked the original Story line from the original movies this one they tried move the story line back to earth but gave a totally different reasoning for the creation of and method of creation of the smart apes.  It is probably best to view this movie as a seperate work and not try to relate to the original movies; if you view it as it's own seperate work as a complete new unrelated story line its much better.  All in all a decent movie.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|This Kindle Fire cover is both handsome and functional.  The fit is perfect.  The cover functions as a protective shield for the kindle as well as a stand.  It doesn't add much weight to the kindle fire and seems to be sturdily built.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Had a lot of fun with this movie. All the bad reviews here take it to seriously. Is the main story orginal? No not really. Is the acting all that great? Nah. Is it aimed toward the 10-14 year old crowd. Yep.  It's a robot boxing movie, with robots named Noisy Boy and Ambush. It's not gonna change the way you think about life.  Grab some popcorn, crank up the surround sound and settle in.  Spoiler alert! - If you hate fun, then you won't like this one.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game - makes you think and tests your skills and you don't have to kill anyone! I find it relaxing and challenging both at the same time.
B004EPYZSK|4.0|Mixing of the old wild west and SciFi tech and Aliens was supprising I was expecting an other worldly experience here with Aliens moving people from the old west to another planet but instead it was really based here in the old west.  The twist and how it could have all been forgotten was well played.  All in all a very good mix of Cowboys, Aliens and SciFi.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun but cert annoying that you need so many points for new games but only get minimal for reaching passing score

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This new Captain America Movie follows the story line of the Comics much more closly than the previous movies that were made it jumps the story line a bit to bring you up a step closer to the next movie they plan to release but was done very well and incorperates a lot of the varance of the comic into the one movie.  All in all very good.

B003Y5H5AG|4.0|Its really difficult to bring a cartoon to live action.  This did a fairly decent job of it. The animation of the Smurfs and Making the villian a live character blended well and the bridging of the two world was creative way of crossing the threshold to tell the story.  All in all a very good movie.
1400052181|5.0|THE IMMORTAL LIFE OF HENRIETTA LACKS is an exceptional book on many levels. I agree with all who have stated what a remarkable job Rebecca Skloot did with what could have been dry material.  The most remarkable aspect of this book was that she successfully demonstrated that right down to the cellular level, EVERY PERSON is an individual. Every person has people they love, and those who love them. Everyone has feelings, and worth. She shows us it would be easy to sink into a debate about the monetary value of a human life, but there is no finite value to the infinite generations who will benefit from the tragic loss of Henrietta's family. They lost their mother, sister, cousin, wife. There is not a dollar amount that will ever give her back. It's a slippery slope to think that we can offer a person money for a life.  Henrietta died in a terrible amount of pain, and her suffering was horribly real. The cells she gave without consent or knowledge have since helped countless people to avoid that pain. A reader can speculate if the doctors approached her and told her, \\"We have no cure today, but the cells from your tumor may prevent other people from suffering this same fate, may we have them?\\" Henrietta might have agreed.  Skloot shines a light on a terrible era in our country, and yet how brightly the human spirit still shines in the face of such tragedy.  Her decade long passionate work has really payed off here.  She helps the reader to understand they didn't experiment on her. The medical staff used the most state of the art treatment they had available to try to help her. This is evidenced by the fact that the people who administered the treatment believed in it so much they suffered the consequences of handling the radium themselves.  Skloot's research revealed that people don't engage in the scientific pursuit of \\"finding a cure\\" for the sake of making mountains of money. They want the cure because they have an understanding at some level how painful loss reallyis. Individuals come up with the desire to stop some horrific disease and all the pain that disease brings, and they approach large companies with the hope of gaining funding for their research.  The money for funding comes from successes these companies have had in the past. If the treatment turns out to be detrimental, these companies suffer the tremendous loss (including the loss of jobs of all who worked for them: families....individuals.....relatives and friends suffer alike).  Rebecca Skloot is an example for us all. She looked beyond the wonder of the sheer numbers of cells, and looked for the person behind the cells. She gave Henrietta back her name, and has helped countless people who handle human cells to know that each culture had a person behind it. A real person with a real family who suffered real loss. Henrietta has moved from being a clinical observation back into being the person she will always be.  Deborah Lacks is said to believe her mother lives on in every person her mom touches. Henrietta Lacks touches countless people and still speaks to us today. Henrietta Lacks puts a face on every cure she's had her cells in, and now will touch the millions who read her story.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|its. cool but I hate to wait long for the eagle its not has I give it 5 stars cause it doesn't get me mad over just a game.
B006O5Y0SS|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, since the trailer looked promising and the cast seemed of high quality. It failed to deliver the punch for me. The story line had some momentum, but in the end it remained flat. I kept waiting for something more exciting other then traveling through the timelines, but that was about the most exciting part of the movie.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|Not a bad movie; but I didn't care for the way it portrayed teachers in a bad light.  At least in the end it turns that around.  not a bad story over all but I couldn't rate it very highly.
B004A8ZWWE|5.0|I know I'm a guy and like typical \\"man movies,\\" but I really liked this movie and thought it was one of the best of 2011.  The story was interesting from beginning to end, the acting was great, and the special effects were awesome.<br /><br />This movie has been branded a boxing movie and even \\"Rocky with robots,\\" but I would argue that this is more of a story about a father and his estranged son that build their relationship.  They simply use robot boxing as their common interest to bond over.  The fighting scenes are obviously great, but thankfully, they're only the finishing touches to this movie.  The story and relationships provide for a great foundation and an all around well done picture.  This is what separates it from other \\"man movies\\" since the scenes without boxing still progress the story and keep your interest peeked.<br /><br />One aspect that made this movie more \\"believable\\" and down-to-earth is that instead of being 100's of years into the future and with over the top electronics, the movie is set in the year 2020 and the technology is just a little more advanced than today.  This saves you from being distracted by flying cars and computer chips in people's brains.  Compare this to \\"Transformers\\" where it takes Optimus Prime 5 minutes to transform and where a cell phone becomes a living organism.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman, of course, delivers a solid performance, but more importantly, Dakota Goyo (who plays the son) is GREAT.  Too often we've seen great movies tarnished by child actors who need a little more practice before they get cast in a blockbuster movie (Star Wars: Episode 1 comes to mind).  But Dakota does a great job of being the smart alecky boy who loves video games and robot boxing.<br /><br />The special features on the blu ray aren't too spectacular, but maybe I had high hopes since I like the movie so much.  There is an app for your laptop or iPad that syncs with the movie as a 2nd screen, which sounds a lot cooler than it turns out tobe.  But I'm also thankful that the special features are more than just trailers and production stills.<br /><br />Bottom line, I feel that Real Steel didn't get the credit it deserved, and had it not been for a snowy night with a rental movie, I wouldn't have even seen it myself.  Even if you're not much for boxing, this movie is still worth watching.
B0001ARCFA|5.0|The quality of sound is clean, and bass/mid/treble are spot on. These headphones feel very light on my head, and easily/automatically adjust to my head size. The actual earphone parts fit perfectly and fully around my ear. The whole design makes these headphones flexible, so if you like to DJ and/or produce music using one ear like I do, it easily lets you do this. The cable is on the longer side (longer than I expected) and depending on who you are, you might or might not like that. This cable is also detachable, which is great for portability and if you happen to run it over with a chair or something (the usual death of many headphone cables), it can be replaced. The design is not flashy, yet sleek at the same time(in my opinion of course). In short, if you want portable, flexible, and great sounding DJ/Production headphones, it's worth every penny.

B006FE83U4|5.0|The 411 by Maria:<br />Unlike a lot of my friends, I don't recall having to read this book in school but then again, that was a long time ago. If I am going to watch or read something, I don't like to read the synopsis so I had no idea what the movie was about when I started.<br /><br />The movie is set in the 1930's and focus on Atticus Finch played magnificently by Gregory Peck and his two children, Jem and Scout (more on them later). Atticus is a respected attorney who has been commissioned to represent Tom Robinson, a black man accused of raping a woman in her own home.<br /><br />What I Can Tell You:<br />Wow, where do I start. I was completely floored with this movie. Gregory Peck performance is completely stunning! The fact that he won best actor for the role was not lost on me, completely worthy of it and one of the best acting I have ever seen. However, after seeing some of the bonus features, I believe he was pretty much playing himself!  A gentle, kind soul, whose thoughtfulness and mannerisms bring out the best in those around him. He allows, after a gentle nudge to make their own assumptions and mistakes in life in hopes of becoming a better person.<br /><br />The actress who played Scout was unbelievably \\"real\\". You would never believe that this child was not Gregory Peck's daughter. There is real love there and I was n awe of how much acting had to be done. Most emotions were seen not heard. Without the use of a soundtrack and a whole lot of dialogue these actors really have to ACT! You can hear everything. The actors are not bogged down with dialogue, the scene is set, and you act!<br /><br />The quietness of the whole movie is really what got me. When I discussed it with people after watching, those who have seen or have not, that was what I mentioned most. I appreciated the quietness. For such a sensitive subject matter, I felt that if this was being done today, the deepness of it would be lost in translation.<br /><br />I have so many favorite scenes:<br /><br />  Scout saying goodnight to her father and asking what he has to pass on to her when he is gone.<br />  Brock Peters taking the stand. His emotion was so real!<br />  Atticus speaking to his children. He is such a gentle, caring man who obviously loves his children.<br />  Scout and Jem's relationship. Anytime they were on the screen I was in love.<br />  Scout talking to the gang who headed to the jail to take the law in their own hands. Her innocence was palpable.<br />  Scout talking to Boo Radley after he helped her and her brother.<br /><br />If you do get the Blu-ray, take time to watch the bonus features. Truly a blessing to have this footage. Well worth your time.<br /><br />To Kill a Mockingbird won Academy Awards for Best Actor (Peck), Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Art Direction. Truly a classic and one that everyone should watch.  This is when acting was actually acting. No green screens, no classy soundtracks, no glamorous special effects, just acting at its finest.at he has to pass on to her when he is gone.    Brock Peters taking the stand.

B005CFLQ3I|5.0|This was a great quick read. It was much better than I thought it would be, good book for teens and adults. I look forward to more in this series.
0765356139|4.0|In This book the the scope and the setting in Mistborn is greatly expanded, we finally get to read about the kolasas, that were talked about in Mistborn, but now we get to see them fight and get a haunting picture of their description.  we get to See Elend really step up and try to be King of Luthdal.  Vin gets tempted by the dark side, and shows a very vicious side.  Breeze one of my favorite characters from the first book has some interesting a quite humorous character developments.  Sazed gets to really fight in this book, and that's pretty epic.  There are a lot of deaths in this book, but if you read Mistborn you know Sanderson can write a surprise death of a beloved charter, very well.<br /><br />The Twist and turns in this novel I did not see coming, many times I was surprised and wondered how characters were going to get out of situations. There's way too many shocking moments to mention.<br /><br />Why I gave this book 4 stars: This book had a little bit of a hard time going, the first 150 pages were a little bit rough and in need of some of Keslier's humor from the first book.  Breeze enters at about that mark giving the book some humor.  The way allomancy works was just overkill for people who read the first book.  The story is amazing and the last 200 pages are can't put down, The final twist is really good and leads you in to the next book perfectly, which I'm starting after I finish this book.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|Actually really enjoyed it.  not what I expected, but enjoyed it nevertheless. As far as quality, would rate it up there with Batman Begins, for all superhero flic fans.  actually had very good action scenes, was well acted, well filmed and had a good story.  What more could you ask for in an action flic. I will definately buy this one and add it to my collection to watch again.  Give it a 9. Not bad at all!
B004132HZS|5.0|I was extremely happy that I purchased this series!!  It is a very inventive, entertaining and unique adaptation of Sherlock Holmes!!  I thought at first that it would be strange having Holmes in the 21st Century, but the creators made it feel very natural.  The one and only complaint that I have about this series is that there are not enough episodes!!!!!!!!!  Three 90 minute stories just have me REALLY wanting more!!!  I hope that the BBC publishes the 2012 episodes that they are airing to DVD very quickly because I don't get the BBC channels where I am.  If you are a Holmes fan looking for something different, I HIGHLY recommend this series!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this case shortly after getting my Kindle Fire. I wasn't sure at first if I would like a case over the fire as I like the sleek design. I ordered this case and it's perfect! Doesn't make it any bulkier and protects it very well. The little kickstand on the back part is convenient. Overall, I would recommend this cover to anyone with the Fire!!
B002ZG98UA|5.0|In yet,another physically demanding role, Milla Jovovich delivers the goods. Fans of the Resident Evil series, won't be disappointed by this latest installment. Apocalyptic  horror abounds, with few lulls in the action.
B004I8WD6E|3.0|I've had the case for a couple of months now and I'm noticing that its starting to turn a yellow/orange color. It's great at protecting my iphone though. When I received the case I didn't know that it came with a screen protector, I was pretty rough pulling out the contents out of the box and  I made a dent on the screen protector. I still applied it to my phone, but now my phone has this huge bubble on the side. Just word of advice, it comes with a screen saver, so when you open the package be gentle so that you don't ruin it.
B0034G4P8A|1.0|I really liked Batman Begins, Capt. America, Spiderman, Daredevil, but this one is sickening.  cheezy to say the least.  not into the main actor at all, the stupid plot, or dumb dialog. I think I've gotten my point across.  except for the beginning, middle and ending, I guess it was tolerable.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This game is great when you need a fun activity to do. I love playing on it!!!!!!!!! Whenever I need something fun to do I don't ask questions on what I should do I get on and PLAY CHESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Bought as a gift for my son at Christmas.<br /><br />Worked great for a month.  The base unit still seems to be working fine.  However the head set will not power up and you can hear a rattle in side one othe ear pieces.<br /><br />I thought it would last longer.  Can not return cause I have passed the return window with amazon.<br /><br />Contacted Turtle Beach did the RMA process.  Received repaired set in about a week.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My Kindle Fire loves this case!  Oh yeah, I do too!  Snug fit, excellent design, can't find anything wrong with it.
B00466HN86|5.0|This is a movie for the days we are living in. All of Sherwood films are superior. We need more faith-based movies.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|having read all of the tintin books by herge, i was anxious to see this, yet reluctant in thinking they were going to change it a lot for the movie.  I was very happy to see they kept it true to the charectors intended by herge. The story was great, and kept you on the edge of your seat, the animation and effects were absolutly stunning.  Great job!  This movie was much better than I even hoped for. You'll enjoy it no matter how you see it, but the 3D is awesome.  I would pay to see it in the theater, and will buy the dvd.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i like how much control i have over almost every aspect of the filters and brushes are fun and many youbcan download more too. random Colorado is an amusing feature too.
145162445X|5.0|This is my favorite book by Lawrence Krauss.  As always, his genius is potent in his prose, but delivered in a way that can be well-understood by the lay person.  Fascinating - had a hard time putting it down!
B006PTL1QM|4.0|\\"A Dangerous Method\\" (99 min.) is a historical drama featuring two parallel but intertwined stories: first the troubled relationship between Swiis doctor Carl Jung, founder of the analytical psychology (played by current \\"It\\" actor Michael Fassbender) and his Russian patient (and medicine university student) Sabina Spielrein (played by Kiera Knightley); and second the budding rivalry and eventual fall-out between Jung and Austrian-born Sigmund Freud (played by Viggo Mortensen), who of course revolutionaized the medical world in the early 20th century with his theories of psychoanalysis.<br /><br />The movie is directed by David Cronenberg, yes the same director who brought us The Fly, A History of Violence, and Crash, just to name those. I cannot recall a single movie off the top of my head directed by Cronenberg that is anywhere similar to this one. No matter. This movie is a \\"talk\\" movie, not an action movie. The script is by Christopher Hampton, and I wish more context wouul've been provided as to the moment in history that these events are taking place. But in the end, you will marvel at the acting performances in this movie. Knightley brings her best performance ever, period (check out the first 10 min. of the movie!).<br /><br />And then there is Michael Fassbender, whom I just recently saw brilliantly in \\"Shame\\". Here he goes completely the opposite direction and brings a restrained, if not understated, but beautiful performance as Jung. How is it possible that Fassbender did not get a single Oscar nomination for either performance? It blows the mind. All that aside, \\"A Dangerous Method\\" is a nice little movie, but beware, not for anyone in a hurry or wanting to see an \\"action\\" movie.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|We know him as Driver.  He doesn't carry a gun; he drives.  That's his job, and he's good at it.  Why?  Because it's a job, plain and simple.  But then he makes the ultimate mistake: he makes it personal.  And now people have to pay.<br /><br />There's a beautifully misleading simplicity about DRIVE.  It isn't what you think.  Behind Ryan Gosling's emotionless face is a deep well of emotions: anger, disgust, amusement, empathy.  Gosling is perfect in the part, conveying equal parts machismo, rage, and compassion.  He doesn't say much, but he doesn't need to: Driver is a man of action, not words.  As his quasi-romantic interest, Carey Mulligan again dazzles.  With a lesser cast and crew, her role would be shallow, merely there to serve the plot; she makes it three-dimensional, her own.  The same goes for the various supporting players: Bryan Cranston, Oscar Isaac, Christina Hendricks, James Biberi, and Ron Perlman.  Kudos especially to Albert Brooks, who makes arguably the most plausible charming-to-sadistic transition in recent cinema.  Props must also be given to the ever-steady direction of Nicolas Winding Refn, and the above-par script by Hossein Amini (who penned the unfairly overlooked KILLSHOT).<br /><br />DRIVE isn't a film for everyone.  It's a slow-burning noir in the old fashioned style: an anti-hero who's as much villain as anything; a dame in distress who's really tough-as-nails (but still beautiful and vulnerable); a cast of characters who are mostly unlikable.  It'll certainly be a disappointment to anyone whose short attention span has been captivated by the various FAST AND FURIOUS films.  (You hear about the person who sued because they thought it was an action film?  Wonder if it's the same person who was surprised at how hot their McDonald's coffee was.)  But for those with patience, and appreciation for subtlety and nostalgia, DRIVE is the film you've been waiting for.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|There are some works of fiction that are easy to pick apart and chew up because, being mostly culled from imagination, bits and pieces may not add up. This isn't one of those books. Like a piece of art that has endeared itself to one's heart such that its subsequent incarnations need not hide their flaws anymore, one does not come into this book with the intellect of a recent literature graduate to proselytize plots, settings, characterizations, misplaced commas and typeface (or whatever literature graduates quibble about).  The book is peppered with references to omens and Personal Legends. It makes you wonder whether life really wants you to achieve your Personal Legend or if there's a way to make sense of all the chaos. Whether haphazardly scribbled notes would someday turn into a novel. It gives you hope.  At some point, it stops being the kind of literature that has to conform to any sort of formality. It just is and what a wonderful feeling it is not to have to nitpick on something just to show that you analyze better than everyone else. Somewhere along the way, it became so that I wasn't just reading; I was also going over my own life, wondering where I'm headed, whether I'm also following my own Personal Legend.  The whole book speaks so voluminously that if I were looking for just one particular thing that calls out to me, I'd be in for a surprise deluge. At every turn, there is a passage that strikes a blow. From there, I started to doubt whether I was merely letting myself get carried away. It is a wordless form of doubt that later formed itself into a question: \\"Are you so jaded and old that you've forgotten what it's like to dream?\\" And so, even in my attempt to get away from my own emotions, I am pulled back to them.  If I were to begrudgingly assign errors (a human frailty I've perfected over the years), I would say that all characters speak like each other. Even the non-human characters that are allocated their own speaking lines speak the same way.Again, that Personal-Legend-hunter in me would ascribe that to a reason: Perhaps, we are all a part of each other. And why does everyone seem to believe in omens and Personal Legends? There is an answer to that as well: We meet people whom we need to meet, those who will fire us up to pursue our dreams.  I have a grudge with this book, too, though. It tends to be religious and biblical and I'm not a fan of anything that tends to convert. Still, I'm forced to ask myself, \\"Why is that so bad?\\" If I'm not going to be converted anyway, what is wrong with any piece of work attempting to do so?  In the end, that literary critic in me is curbed and I'm just so happy to let it stay silent.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. I have it installed on my iphone, Kindle Fire, and computer.  Great way to always have the Bible with you.  I also like the reading plans.
1594744769|3.0|The first half of this book would have been rated 5 stars.  It was SO well-written, with many excellent turns of phrase, that it could be used as a text for writers to show what good writing can be like.  The plot was tight and atmospheric, and it was full of suspense regarding what the REAL story was.  Was Jacob crazy?  Was his grandfather crazy?  What had really happened to his grandfather? I would recommend that book to anyone who likes mysteries because of the quality of the writing.  Unfortunately, once Jacob arrives at the island, all the suspense evaporates and the story degenerates into a fairly standard supernatural teen book that I might enjoy, but certainly wouldn't recommend to anybody.  I agree with the other reviewers that the lack of resolution at the end, and the obvious lead-in to other books in the upcoming series, was disappointing.  So, my rating is 5 stars for the first half, 2 stars for the second, making an average of 3.
0740748475|5.0|This collection has a HUGE amount of Calvin and Hobbes in one place. I can't think of any reason why that would deserve anything but five stars.
1451627289|5.0|Stellar!  Genius! Stephen King has made me his fan forever:  especially since Cell, Duma Key, The Dome, and now 11/22/63.  I loved the story of Jake and Sadie.  I loved Al and his initiative to have Jake time travel.  I loved the people in Jody.  I feel alone now that the story is over. And I can't believe I cried at the end of a Stephen King novel.  My husband and I listened to 11/22/63; the narrator gave such quality to Jake's voice, that I saw him in my head and carried my vision of him for the past 30 or more hours everytime we drove in the car.  We purposefully drove just to keep up with what would happen next in Dallas.  But this book was about more than President Kennedy life or death; it was more than a love story, it was a life's lesson: \\"life turns on a dime,\\" hold on to everything that's dear and  near to you; don't waste time on petty things; find the harmony in life, the people who love you and love them back: they won't be around forever and neither will you.  I'm so glad I listened to this book with my husband, who is my best friend in the whole world.  It meant so much to us as he is receiving chemo for colon cancer. And our lives have changed because of a lot of the things Stephen shared as the author at the end of the book and in his epilogue.  Stephen, you've given us a wonderful story.  God Bless You.  A publisher has  recently published one of my books, and you've given me strength to continue my own writing and tell stories the way I know how.  You are an inspiration.  Patricia Florio
0439023521|3.0|(3.5 Stars) I wouldn't say that the writing is fantastic; don't expect to expand your vocabulary if you've made it past the 4th grade. However, it's not a bad way to spend a day, and it totally does have the can't-put-it-down factor.  Pros  - Quick read; brief and relevant descriptions that don't deviate from the story  - Strong female protagonist who isn't annoying  - Interesting blend of Battle Royale + Olympics + Survivor  - Pacing is excellent  Cons  - No justification for the actions of some minor characters (the stylists, for example)  - The amount of skill and luck that contribute to the end is quite unbalanced, assuming most readers prefer skill  - District 12 appears as the only district where individuals are capable of mind games; would have been better to get an understanding of other psychological strategies (other than historical references to past hunger games)  - They should have named Katniss' nemesis, Cliche, instead
B003S897UK|4.0|Gov't Mule is a great band with excellent musicians. They are very versatile and can perform a wide array of styles. This is a good cd because it's a good blend of GM originals and an eclectic mix of good time covers to accentuate the party atmosphere. I would recommend this for people who are new to Gov't Mule for this very reason. You will be exposed to their catalog but you'll also get to hear stuff you'll recognize. They are a great live band and they have some awesome guest appearances on this one.
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|Writer-director Tate Taylor's adaptation of Kathryn Stockett's novel suffers from an erratic tone and overlength - deleting crucial details yet taking forever to get started. Despite its flaws, \\"The Help\\" (2011) is redeemed by a powerful ensemble cast. Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer are a revelation - deserving of all the praise and awards. However, \\"The Help\\" would have benefited from a stronger directorial hand. Taylor's cinematic inexperience prevents this social drama from reaching greatness - regrettably lacking the admirable courage of Aibileen and Minnie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to download on to my Kindle, fun to play.<br />I have this on my Kindle fire so I can pass the time anywhere the I have to wait.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|This game our solid on play and is a great throw back to the 80s classic.  I made it through 8 levels and decided that was enough, just got too boring for me.  Worked well on droid x.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i think the games are very fun. i think they need to be at a lower level of difficulty for younger children.
B000002MUQ|4.0|This is good because it has the hit \\"Can't Stop Loving You\\" but the lesser known songs are also very good for anyone who likes Van Halen and good guitar licks.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are way too hard, but the majority are fun time wasters. I like how you have to earn points to unlock more games. Not bad for a free app.
B004DN3VEM|5.0|This is probably my favorite rock album of all time.  Phenomenal music, awesome lyrics and the grandiosity wich was Ronnie James Dio is fully evident in the ttacks that comprise this album.    From the semi-haunting keyboard intro of \\"Tarot Woman\\" to the sweeping maelstrom of sound which is \\"Stargazer\\" this album is a masterpiece.  Much of this album takes me back a long way and to distant places, kind of the way some Zeppelin does, like \\"Kashmir\\".    The immensity of the music and the modes used in crafting the songs gives this album a sense of the sum being greater than all of its parts.  This group of musicians came together and created a true gem.  In my opinion they had never crafted anything as amazing before this, and none would do so afterward. Although some may disagree, I believe this was the true pinnacle of their craftsmanship, Ronnie and Ritchie, two of the greatest wizards of music.    Listen to this album and learn to love it.  Wait,... what's that ...?  Oh, some thing's calling me back . . . . . . . .
0385737955|5.0|Great 7 & up read!  Original storyline of a teenage boy that appears in a life-sized maze with other boys, vicious creatures, mysterious diseases and no memory of his life before.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|I was thrilled to purchase this to have it in my collection.  My 8 year old and I sit and watch this over and over and still roar over it. The minions are so funny and Gru (Steve Carell) is despicably entertaining.  Good mix of characters in this and there really aren't any low parts because the minions fill in spaces.
1451627289|5.0|I LOVED this book!!  I'm not even a \\"die hard\\" Stephen King person.  I have absolute respect for him as a successful author - no doubt - I just don't get everything that he does.  I've enjoyed some of his work though, I even made it through \\"Under The Dome\\", which I thought was okay.  It was good enough to get me through all  1,088 pages but I wasn't super excited about it.<br /><br />I loved 11/22/63 though.  It really makes you wonder what life would be like if one thing had or hadn't happened.  There are so many of those \\"watershed moments\\" in all of our lives, some affect a smaller circle of us, some affect the entire nation and spread to the rest of the world like the assassination of John F. Kennedy and 9/11.  We immediately think if only those things didn't happen, life would be great, but would it?  What would you do if you had the power to change fate?  Would it really make things better or worse if things didn't follow the way they are meant to be?  This is really a GREAT book for a book club.  You can really get into some wonderful, deep discussions.  Books that get you thinking and talking afterwards.  Love that!!
B0025VLELQ|5.0|This is a great old movie.  I still enjoy the performances.  The special effects are dated and a bit crude looking, but hey, someones got to start it.  This is a very enjoyable movie.
B001TODO54|5.0|Great Read, 7 & up!  My latest favorite, teenage female protagonist graced with the ability to kill, gains independence, discovers her true grace, true love, and embarks on impossible, selfless journey.
B002VWNID6|4.0|Great enjoyable film, just be careful which disk you order.  I bought this film on DVD a year ago through an Amazon third party, for around $5.99.  As noted by others here, half the movie was missing, and there was no title sticker at the top of the case, which sometimes means you have a bootleg copy or a repackaged disk.  The good news: Amazon stood behind the product and gave me a full refund.  I ordered it again this month, almost 12 months later, but this time offered directly from Amazon, and received yet another disk that had only half the movie: it stops at the beginning of Scene 17 and even the index shows this.  Called Amazon, they apologized and are sending another copy to me overnight.  I hold out hope that I get a real full copy this time.  My advice: read these reviews and order the two set DVD that everyone is raving about.  It seems to be the real deal.  All logistics aside, this is a fun and entertaining movie that features a hilarious over the top performance by the fabulous (pre-Harry Potter) Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham.  Costner is good in the title role and the chemistry between him and Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio (as Maid Marion)seems genuine, and you have the pure delight of Morgan Freeman's magnificent presence. And as a (small) bonus,a semi-decent, scowling performance from Christian Slater.  Blasphemy I know but I like this film much better than the iconic 1938 Errol Flynn Robin Hood.  This film, Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, has a cohesive storyline, and characters, you actually care about.  So order the DVD just be sure it's the two disk set. Either way you are covered under Amazon's excellent return policy.
B0043D2LAC|5.0|I use this case for my Sony Nex-5n.  That's because it's got the Lowepro quality you can expect.  While it wasn't meant to be used for the Sony Nex compact cameras, it does a great job of it.  Most bags are too big or too small.  The Nex system is larger than most MFT systems such as Olympus, Panasonic, Samsung or Nikon.  So a lot of cases for those \\"compact\\" systems don't work.  They could work, but usually only with the pancake lens.  Very limiting.  Furthermore, they usually aren't modular, and so can't expand as your craft grows.  Small and modular.<br /><br />But be warned, it's a tight fit.  Go barebones.  Don't expect to bring tons of stuff with you.  It may has just enough room to fit the Nex-7.  I needed something very protective and this is built tough!  You can be light and highly portable, but certain of your gear's safety.  A normal LensPen is too thick to fit on the front pocket, but can fit on the inside.  The mini LensPen works fine.  An extra battery at the bottom of the bag.<br /><br />Adding a shoulder strap makes it lay nicely behind me, until needed.  Then it swings quickly forward, fast unzip, snap, stow away.  It becomes a glide strap, by carrying across the body, with an added 50 cent buckle from REI.<br /><br />But there's more.  With the slip-lock system, I can expand the space on both sides.  Currently I have a 9x13cm lens case, that stores my pancake 16mm lens, my Ultra-wide adapter, and the Fish-eye adapter together.  Being modular allows me freedom of choice of how much to bring, depending on my situation.  That's 5 lenses currently, with room for another Sliplock on the other side.
B00127RAJY|4.0|The first time I tried this DVD, I only made it through about the first ten minutes. I took the DVD out of the player and threw it in the trash.  About an hour later I got it back out of the trash and decided to give it a second chance.  A couple of days later I was able to make it a little bit further through the workout.  Now I can make it through level one without having to stop for too many breaks.  It's a tough workout. But a good one. Stick with it and you'll see results.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun games and it is really easy to unlock new games. I love this app. it is awesome
B0059XTUVI|5.0|Meryl Streep is just an amazing actress to watch, perhaps the best in the world. She is like a chameleon; she total disappears into each role she plays, leaving none of her own personality. Just as she vanished into Julia Child and a severe nun, etc, she completely vanishes into Margret Thatcher. So much so that after the movie, I went to the web to remind myself what the real Maggie Thatcher looked like. She looks, sounds and affects the same attitudes even the same hair styles as Maggie! Even her voice has Thatcher sound to it, gestures mannerisms. So astounding you will forget who you are watching.<br /><br />\\"The Iron Lady\\" is surrounded by ghosts. Streep plays her in snapshots from various parts of her life, but mostly the current Maggie, who, if we believe the plot, suffers from dementia. Current Maggie has long conversations with her husband, Denis Thatcher (played by Jim Broadbent), husband who died in 2003, or his ghost, who she sees but no one else does. She is reluctant to clean out his closet and throw away his clothes even though he has been dead for nearly a decade. He might need them.<br /><br />We are also shown the Maggie who lead England to war to get back the stolen Falkland Islands, facing striking labour unions, the Maggie who cut government services to lower taxes (mostly to help the rich, critics say). Maggie says \\"in the past, people in the country used to `do' things, now they just want to talk about their `feelings'\\", or words to that effect. She later repeats this.<br /><br />This movie not only shows Maggie as terrifying with little sympathy for the people her policies might hurt, but also a great warrior and ultimately pitiable old figure.<br /><br /> The best actress of 2011. the only reason Streep might not win is she has won so many other times. But her acting will take your breath away. The only movie this year with acting as good as \\"The Kings Speech\\". Whether you liked Thatcher's politics or not you will marvel at this portrayal.
B0068TL23G|3.0|i love playing the game. Its extremely fun and the concept is great. 3 BIG mechanical errors prevent me from giving it a 5. 1.More times than not i feel the game isnt accurate when registering my paths. 2. This one is HUGE for me; if you decide to replay a level to beat your previous score but then give up, your previous score is lost. 3. I feel the back button on my phone should be used to back to a previous menu instead of exiting the game, im not a huge fan of the on screen back button. Too used to using my phones back button
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This item is no frills but awesome! I got the pink one...so cute! Thought about white but since I knew it would be tumbling around my hand bag didn't want it to look dirty w/ pen marks etc. Made of a great material so it helps you keep a good grip on your kindle. Super light weight. Easy to use...quick to open and close with elastic... and fold as a stand!  Best of all every time you put on cover it gets rid of your fingerprints on the screen! Loved it and great price,worth every penny!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great app.  Really enjoyable and very addictive.  My 6 year old also loves this app.  Definitely recommend.
B004EBUXSA|4.0|I just \\"upgraded\\" my [[ASIN:B004EBUXHQ Intel Core i5-2500K Processor]] to the [[ASIN:B004EBUXSA Intel Core i7-2600K Processor]]. A local retailer was running a deal that couldn't be passed up. I do a lot of GIS work, run Adobe Creative Suite and commonly have a VirtualBox session running. I know how to make the cores sing. For my purpose, this is a good investment. For most people, however, the [[ASIN:B004EBUXHQ Intel Core i5-2500K Processor]] will be a better solution.<br /><br />One thing that I did notice right off - this chip overclocks higher than my 2500K. Maybe I got \\"bin\\" lucky. Problem with overclocking is that you can't tell what the upper end will be until you crank up the clock speed. In the exact same box, with the [[ASIN:B005QUQP8U Corsair Hydro Series H70 Core Liquid CPU Cooler - CW-9060002-WW]], I could not get the i5-2500K to run stable over 4.2Ghz where the i7-2600K is currently set at 4.5Ghz. I haven't tried to go any higher because I will have to rethink the fans on the radiator. Right now, under full load, the CPU creeps up to about 85C. That's still well within acceptable temps. Right now I have just a single [[ASIN:B00276D4RG Noctua 120mm Adjustable Speed Fan]] running at 600rpm in a push configuration. I can try cranking up the RPMs on the fan or even add a second fan so I get push-pull.<br /><br />Update: It was just pointed out to me in the comments that my temp is too high. Intel's specs say TcaseMax is 72.6C. What the sensor reported in CPU-Z measures is about +10C over TcaseMax. So at 85C, my CPU was stepping outside the chip's tolerances. I'll have to play around with either reducing the clock speed or moving more air through the radiator to get the temps down. Maybe I can even get the clock speed up some more!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|For me, this movie could have been faster in storytelling, but it was more important that we knew who Captain America was, and even better than that, who was  Steve Rogers.  There were many physically endowed candidates that they could have chosen for the super serum program, but they chose the one who had the most heart and love for his country and himself, and unless you are an avid Cap fan, then for the novice hero-lover, this is a good starting point to be introduced to.  As the film came along, action-packed and all, we see the costume and the shield, but throughout, we see the man behind it all, and that made the movie worthwhile.  WAY TO GO, CAP!!

1442419814|4.0|I'm still a newbie to YA fiction and in particular dystopia, and this series came highly recommended in this genre.<br /><br />In Uglies, there are no ugly people over 16 years. At the age of 16 everyone gets turned \\"pretty\\". Tally can't wait to turn pretty but when her new friend, Shay, goes to join the Smokies, a group that don't want to turn pretty, she must go after Shay or never turn pretty again.<br /><br />Oh the adventure! I really enjoyed Uglies. It was full of adventure, as Tally tries to rescue Shay.<br /><br />I love the world that has been set up, especially the new pretties and the rusties, the civilization that came to an end.<br /><br />Uglies was a really fascinating read and I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

It will have you reaching for a big box of tissues (trust me you will need a big box!). It's the story of fighting cancer and accepting your illness and falling in love.<br /><br />I loved it so much. Hazel is such a strong girl. She lives with cancer everyday, and accepts her situation with snark and humor. The relationship with Hazel and Augustus is so real and so heart wrenching at the same time.<br /><br />As someone that has lost someone close to cancer this story touched my heart so deeply. It's so well written and one that I will keep on my bookshelf to re-read soon.<br /><br />I will definitely be reading more John Green novels in the future.

B004C5M282|2.0|I really wanted to like this album..but it all kinda sounds the same afer a few listens and the singer gets annoying quickly..one standout song Evelyn worth mention though...the rest is pretty much a Denmark version of Nickelback
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I was unfamiliar with Adele until someone performed Rolling In the Deep on \\"The Voice.\\" I loved the song and started learning more. This is my first Adele CD and I absolutely love her voice and her lyrics. So glad I made this purchase!
B0047GNCSU|2.0|DISCLAIMER:  I'm 30yrs old, so I was definitely looking at it from a more \\"mature\\" view point, than maybe the intended audience; However, I felt the book was very flat. I read it in a weekend, and as I read, I was often left wishing it would \\"Hurry up & get to the good part..\\"  I love Lauren Conrad's website,clothes & etc...but I just felt LA Candy should've been edited better.  The story content was pretty weak and took so much time trying to elaborate on things that were commonly understood.  I also found myself wishing that the names that were chosen weren't so \\"obviously\\" made up.  I don't know if that even makes sense to anyone else but me, but it just seemed that you wouldn't have that many people in the same group with those kinds of names; I guess what I'm saying, is that they were either too crazy sounding or too plain (i.e. Scarlett Harp; Jane Roberts) There weren't many \\"normal- sounding\\" names, and it ended up being kind of distracting.  I'm glad that I bought the first 2 books together, because the second book was notably better.  Again, I am older, so my 15 or 16yr old self might have enjoyed this a little more. It was, however, great for passing the time when there's nothing on tv & you need your LC fix-- just don't expect to be intensely involved.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great and challenging game that keeps you thinking. Lots of levels and complex problems to solve. Would recommend to anyone who likes puzzle games.
0307959856|1.0|WHY WOULD THIS FAMOUS, ACCOMPLISHED WRITER STOOP SO LOW???? DID SHE ACTUALLY WRITE THIS BOOK??? I AM MORE THAN PERPLEXED.  THE BOOK IS SO BORING AND POORLY WRITTEN I COULD NOT EVEN FINISH IT.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I could listen to his voice all day long and never get tired of it. Bruno Mars is so talented. I really enjoy this CD. One of my fave tracks is Liquor Store Blues. Get it! You won't be sorry!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it for everything on my kindle fire and pc, syncs well for a unified note collection. Skitch is great with it.
B006VRZ5YM|5.0|I liked this movie alot. It was a typical romantic comedy nothing too deep but it was cute. Yeah it was predictable and silly at times but it was light hearted. If your looking for something simple and enjoyable you'll like this I think.
1451627289|5.0|Simply put, this is one of the best books I have ever read.  I loved the story, I loved the main characters (especially Jake and Sadie) and I loved the journey. I truly savored every moment of this wonderful and completely engrossing story. And I am simply in awe of Stephen King's writing ability and his imagination. This is one of those books that you think about for a long time after you've read the last word. In fact, I think it has ruined me for reading anything else for a while. Very highly recommended!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I'm not a teenager...in fact, I am 48 and I love Taylor! This is a killer CD. You won't be sorry if you buy it!
159514188X|5.0|This book was very captivating. I can relate to Hannah, so this book was also realistic to me. I felt her pain as if it was my own.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I read many reviews about the difficulty of this workout. I did not believe them but you should. I have no problem getting through 45 minutes of Tae Bo or an hour+ of Zumba. 10 minutes with Jillian Michaels 30 Day Shred and I was literally ready to pass out. I have no doubt that this workout will help reshape my body. I am excited about the next 28 days!!
B00068TJM6|5.0|I've been looking at this watch for many years and finally pulled the trigger. Maybe my open heart surgery had something to do with it. Be that as it may, this watch looks even better in person than in online pictures. The face is deeply recessed and the numerals are very defined and easy to read. I have always admired the Breitling Navitimer, but as many have said, over $3000 for a watch is above my pay grade. For this price? In my opinion, if you want an aviation themed watch you can do no better. I'm a pilot and know how to use the slide rule function but it's use is irrelevant compared to the appearance and satisfaction you will get from wearing this watch. Just do it.
B005K17RU0|3.0|the biggest problem is.that the app is vertical only. there needs to be a way to either manually or.auto rotate.
0545265355|1.0|I have never encountered a book that was so entirely blood, guts, and gore!!  The actual story was so overshadowed by all the mayhem.  I can't believe this book is for young readers.  I would not let my child read anything remotely close to this book.  Just plain bad.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|it is a Lot of fun but the only downside to playing the game is that it takes forever to download and u have to write a review for it.
0393064476|3.0|The book's ambitious subtitle is \\"How the World Became Modern,\\" yet the first 220 pages or so would better be characterized as a historically situated biography of Poggio Bracciolini, a bookhunter and Papal scribe whose main outstanding trait, as Greenblatt reminds us enthusiastically and repeatedly, is \\"beautiful handwriting.\\" The rest of the book is a catalogue of all the intellectual celebrities that possessed copies of De Rerum Natura, although the connection between the poem and their lives is tenuous for all but Montaigne. Not that I mind this: I'm fascinated by the Renaissance and the tale of book hunting and Papal scribes is an interesting vignette of the times.  Scientifically, there is no basis for believing that Lucretius' characterization of atoms was revolutionary or insightful, or that as Greenblatt congratulates his readers, \\"By now much of what On The Nature of Things claims about the universe seems deeply familiar, at least among the circle of people who are likely to be reading these words. After all, many of the work's core arguments are among the foundations on which modern life has been constructed.\\" While it is true that Lucretius, like many Greeks, entertained the idea of an 'atom,' it's clear that he had no scientific or empirical evidence for believing so, and that an educated person of the time would have no more reason to believe that matter consists of atoms than for believing it consisted of air, fire, water and earth, the other Greek theory of physics. It wasn't until 1805 that John Dalton, the English scientist, put forth a compelling theory for why atoms needed to exist. And even that perception of atom, which in Greek literally means \\"indivisible,\\" would be rendered literally false after the later scientific discoveries that atoms could be split, and furthermore that matter could be converted into energy.  Greenblatt seems to suggest that Lucretius's mention of atoms makes valid his other speculations on Epicureanism. He could have put more effort into following this path, to flesh out the impact of Epicurean thought on the modern world. As is, this thought is thinly sketched.  Stylistically, Greenblatt has the habit of trying to think out loud in other people's heads, as though they are characters in a novel: \\"Poggio could not possibly hope\\" (p. 129), \\"What he could not have grasped (p. 182). He engages in self-philosophizing, e.g. turn to p. 151 to find his definition of \\"the epitome of a failed life...\\" and he makes analogies that simply don't work all that well (\\"These relics, like the remains of long-dead insects, tell us what once buzzed about in the air of the Vatican\\", p. 142). His actual discussion of De Rerum Natura (starting in Chapter 8) is surprisingly light in textual quotation, and seems like a Cliffs Notes edition with heavy editorial redaction. It could have benefited from more directly engaging with the text. He frequently engages in the scholar's version of the tar and feather, tempering his excesses by appending something like \\"But of course there were exceptions\\" after making a sweeping generalization, usually negative. I found the discussion of his mother in the preface somewhat disturbing.  This book sheds light on an interesting era, and I especially enjoyed the connections made to modern textual archaeology, e.g. the recovered fragments from Herculaneum. However the writing is uneven and there are probably better places to read about how the world became modern.
B00284BNKC|5.0|This movie totally blew my mind.  I had a friend that went through something similar so I could really relate to this movie.  If you want your heart doused with acid and your brain flipped upside down get this movie.  A must watch for those seeking a tragic story.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|It should be the app of the day because I can get it for free on my nook.  THE END
B003YCI1O8|5.0|If you are buying Tremors you already know what you are getting into. So not discussing the film.  The transfer looks really good! It was actually somewhat shocking. This is one of those $5 - $8 bargain bin movies, so it's pretty crazy to see it with an actual good transfer. I felt like the sound wasn't quite as good as I was hoping for, but it's still pretty good. For the cheap price of the pick up I'd definitely give it a 5 star review!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|even though u use a lot of points to unlock the games, it saves a lot of space on my kindle fire so I don't need a million game apps ( I mainly did this for the 250,000 points)
0307266303|5.0|This book is superficially about running but mostly about lives, where excellence comes from (all over?), admirably monastic meandering biographies  (Caballo), how truly meritocratic better-than-Olympian competition really works, the evolutionary biology and modern messing with the genius of the running-ready foot, and why Homo Sapiens bested the Neanderthals and made us us.
B003L77G2Y|5.0|Great price for the product and have been waiting for it to come down so that I could afford it.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|The original King Kong is still the best one! The last two advanced the special effects, but this one was done with so much care (The stop motion animation is still impressive), and all the stars were aligned to make this the most thrilling. It's helped immensely by Max Steiner's classic score. And nobody, but NOBODY can scream in terror like Fay Wray!  It's digitally remastered and looks great and there's also a photo gallery of Merian C. Copper's trailers.
B004RPKUTU|3.0|Was happy to finally read this book, but was sad to see it arrived soaking wet. Not sure if that was the fault of the seller or just the shippers in general, but it certainly put a damper on the experience (no pun intended). As far as content, the book is good, but obviously it is about fifth grade reading level, and it is quite similar to the movie.
B004EPYZSK|2.0|The Good - Daniel Craig makes a heck of a macho cowboy.  The Bad - everything else about this movie - pathetic storyline, tired special effects.  Feel sorry for Harrison Ford who really looks old and worn out in this movie (in a terribly cliche'ed role). Time for him to pick grandpa roles!
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I purchased Gary's book on Audible shortly after it came out in late 2010. After listening through the whole book, my knowledge of nutrition and how the body works was fundamentally altered, I have continued to learn and research issues around health and wellness ever since. I lost a signifcant amount of weight in only a couple of months after implementing a new lifestyle based on this book, and continue to refine and improve my health as I learn more about different aspects of health and nutrition.<br /><br />I believe this is THE book that those wishing to improve their health should read, it will set you up with the foundational knowledge you need to start making a real difference in your life.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy playing the games on this app even though some are a little tougher then.others but.still a lot of fun tonplay

B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is fun because it gives you a lot of different types of games to choose from. I love it
B001BJNIIK|5.0|One of my favorite podcasts recommended this movie repeatedly, so when I found out it was streaming for free, I jumped at the chance. And let me tell you, this movie is ridiculous. I started laughing when Sylvester Stallone shot out a gas tanker's windshield from a long distance with a teeny-tiny revolver, and the movie continued to be hilariously over-the-top. A retarded weapons genius, Teri Hatcher as an exotic dancer playing the bongos, a drug kingpin with enough weaponry (and armed monster trucks) to equip a small country, Kurt Russell in drag...you need to watch this movie right now. It must be seen to be believed.
0805053883|5.0|A great 'read a long' book .. so many animals to talk about, easy and fun to read together, and we even recite the story in the car .. it's hours of pure pleasure.  She is 20 months and this tops the favourite list and mine too!

B004XVMCPI|5.0|Item arrived on time, and in working order. Product was as decribed. Good movie if you are a football fan. Requires a different sense of humor, as it is dubbed.
0061122416|1.0|After 40 years of reading I've finally found a book that I actually hate.  Didn't think it was possible.  It may be the inordinate amount of praise this work has recieved that has contributed to my reaction.  I wish it wasn't on my ereader.  It would have been more gratifying ripping the pages to shreds instead of hitting the delete button.

0060987464|5.0|Before reading this book, I personally had never heard many Manson songs in my life, with the exception of a few singles. The further I got into the book, the more intruigued I became. Eventually, I started listening to more of his songs while paying closer attention to the lyrics. I feel as though I understand him as a person much better now.<br /><br />The book starts off describing moments from his childhood, some of which are pretty shocking and terrible. This was my favourite part of the book and I wish he spent longer talking about this part of his life.<br /><br />The majority of the book is stories of his tours, drug use, making albums, and all sorts of x rated shenanigans that went down once he was already famous. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this book immensely! I just wish it focused more on his younger days.<br /><br />All in all, I couldn't put it down and it still gets five stars!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This book held me in thrall from the first page.  I am not a usual King fan, as I think of him as a writer of horror stories.  But I am a voracious reader of historical fiction, and I thought that this new way of viewing the Kennedy assassination (which let's face it, has been covered up, down and sideways...) was worth a look.  What would our history have been if Oswald had failed?  Would we still be the cynical, jaded society that we are today?  Or would our innocence have lasted a bit longer?  Would we have gotten as deeply mired in Vietnam if Johnson hadn't ascended to the presidency under such dire circumstances, carrying the political baggage he had?  Or would those lives lost in the jungles of south Asia been spent in a different way?  It boggles the mind.  Throw in time travel, compelling sub-narratives and a host of wonderful, real characters, and you have a work of stunning originality.  After tearing through the sample, I bought the book and didn't put it down for three days.  I devoured it, and loved every morsel!  It is one of those books where (even at over 800 pages) I thought it was too short...I wanted the story to go on forever.  I loved Jake and Sadie, I loved the ending...heck, I loved everything about this book.  Even if you aren't a usual King reader, give this book a chance.  I don't think you will be disappointed.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is great for wasting time and just having fun, it is a great Apo if you are just looking to get a free app that will keep you addicted forever.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game has been a true lifesaver. Keeps me calm while waiting in long lines every where I go.  Downloaded to my kindle fire &amp; I'm happier than I've been in a long time while waiting in long lines.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|It was rather boring and lack lustre.Matt Damon was detached from the movie and the situations at the start,It is slow paced and lacking in thrill.Utterly disappointed i chose to watch this on family movie night.It leaves one in suspense with most of the characters they pursued in the movie,it lacks proper development for characters such as the blogger,Why are they introduced to the movie ,is it only to prolong it,i think they would have been able to expand on his character.This are just some of the aspects i found lacking in the movie however my dissatisfaction should not deter other movie lovers from watching it.It  just wasn't my cup of tea.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is great. Very easy to keep up with your selling items and bids. Easy to contact your buyers and leave feedback as well. Highly recommended
B002TO1Z8Q|5.0|I play this DVD at least once a week and never tire of it.<br />Already a Huge George Micheal fan. This makes me realize why.<br />He is our best singer song writer ever.<br />Dont ever give it up George.
0439023513|5.0|Superb.  I understand that some are looking for the Cinderella ending, and this certainly isn't it. However, this is a brilliantly engrossing story with lots of truth and as happy an ending as could have been hoped for. Collins keeps it real but certainly not despairing and totally bleak by a long shot. I would say that if you liked book two (and I did) then book three is a must read.
B004UID2LC|5.0|i am glad I got this app it works well on my sony tablet no it does not crash or have any ads popping up... it does a great job snatching youtube videos with the options of previewing it..download as an mp3 or keep as a video...
B0053YGYO4|3.0|Let me start by saying I really enjoy Coldplay, they're one of my favorite bands.  Their music is innovative, melodic and intelligent yet this latest batch of songs is simply not good.  I'll go as far as to say awful, with only Paradise worth tranfering to my music library and elevating my rating to 3 stars.  Somebody blogged it is Coldplay's Zooropa, I agree.  Opinions are subjective of course but comparing it to their Rush of Blood, Parachutes and Viva, well there is no comparison.  The CD just sound like B side outtakes.
0307387178|5.0|I watched the movie several times before I read the book and in my opinion the movie left out several key points that made the book as addicting as it truly was. You really get to see both sides of the story much better and the author own personal experiences are just as exciting as many of the ones Chris McCandless were invved in.
B000BCE918|5.0|Very easy process to order. Fast shipping and came in excellent condition. Arrive just in time for Christmas! Thank you very much
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I love my gps watch/hr monitor. It has definitely changed how I workout and made my efforts more effective. The watch helps me monitor the effort I am putting forth, with the heart rate feature, while seeing my distance improve over the same time and heart rate. I can see my improvement as I look back in the history as well as see where my strong/weak points are with the detailed readouts.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|I give this film 10 stars!!!! First of all, Quentin Tarantino is my all time favorite Movie writer & Director. So, this movie is super awesome!! I love it, love it love it. I watch my movies repeatedly and this one is now exception to thta rule!! Still in great condition, with no complaints. The scalp cutting scene is gross and just the sound of it can make me cringe!  ick!
145162445X|5.0|This book is a review of our current knowledge about our universe at the largest scales science can say anything about. The results of our study reveal a very strange place and Prof. Krauss makes the difficult concepts accessible to the interested layman that is willing to mentally reach for this worthwhile goal. The book also looks at how what we know constrains what we don't (yet) know. In particular, the question of where the material in our universe, and the universe itself, came from is discussed in the light of our new knowledge. Science has revealed a truly surprising universe but perhaps the best part is the fact that we are able to understand these things at all. While reading this book Prof. Krauss lets you share the excitement, wonder, and awe that science brings. Our success gives us reason to continue to study and, perhaps answer, ever more profound questions.  The book is clear and accessible to the non-expert, written with a light and easily readable tone, sprinkled with humor and personal accounts yet packed with information and insight. Highly recommended.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|If you liked rocky, then Real Steel is one of those movies that'll remind you of it. The big difference is that real steel has robots fighting each other instead of humans. This movie takes you on a deeper ride in the world of deadly robot boxing tournaments and shows you how a father and a son unite again thanks to a fighting bot named Atom. Don't miss out on this movie so just buy the dvd and watch it with your whole family, I guarantee you are going to want to watch it over and over again. Real Steel rocks!!!
0446585025|1.0|I am surprised that Ellen let this get published. It's that bad. It is anything but interesting and she has nothing to say or share. I finished the book, but I wish I hadn't.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|For some reason, I wasn't very excited about the new Beatles remasters when they were released in 2009, but I recently decided to buy the mono box, and I am very glad I did.  The only good thing I can think of about waiting so long to get this is that the price is now much better than it originally was, but on the other hand: wow, I've really been missing out!  Here are my favorite things about this box set:  1. Unlike the stereo remasters, these mono remasters do not have extra compression added, which IMHO really ruins the overall enjoyment of the 2009 stereo cd's.  2. The mono mix versions of Sgt. Peppers, Magical Mystery Tour, Revolver, and Rubber Soul are, at least to me, the more enjoyable versions of these albums, and are only available in this box set.  3. The original stereo mix of Help!, also only available in this set, is much better (again IMHO) than the '87 mix that was again used for the 2009 stereo remaster. The '65 stereo mix is my favorite version of this album.  4. The first 4 mono remastered albums sound noticeably better to me than the original '87 mono cd versions of these albums.  5. I love the mono versions of \\"Revolution 2\\" and the 4 tracks from the Yellow Submarine soundtrack, again only available here.  6. The packaging is fun.  So, there are other things I really enjoy about this box, but those top my list.  I find the mono mixes of The Beatles (White Album) interesting, but really prefer the stereo (in fact, the '87 cd over the '09 remaster) version of that album.  I highly recommend this box to any Beatles fan's who don' yet have it.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|With this app. your Android hasn't any limits. Want to watch Hulu but keep getting this is not available for mobile, not so with this app. Want to play Pogo you can with this app. Your Android has absolutely zero limits with this app.
B0000524CY|4.0|The Exorcist is certainly a scary movie, with its unforgettable images of a girl possessed by the fury and its accompanying special effects. Who can forget the stairway scene? Visually, this movie leaves a lasting impression. Musically, it's powerful and dramatic, and psychologically, well, that's what this movie is all about. Still, this movie isn't perfect. Believe it or not, I think that it could've been darker. Perhaps the story could've been set many decades earlier to give it a less modern look. I just think that a story like this needs a more suitable setting, say the late 1800s with horses and lanterns on dark streets,  rather than modern amenities. This wouldve given the movie more texture throughout. Still, this is a classic horror movie that put the 'scare' into the scary movie category. This movie is a must-see for horror aficionados.
B006PTL1QM|3.0|A DANGEROUS METHOD is a heavily intellectual work, with a heavy emphasis on sex...much like the work of Sigmund Freud, one of the main characters in t his fascinating yet aloof film.  The movie starts with a bang, as we see the clearly disturbed Sabina Spielrein (Keira Knightley) being forcibly admitted to a hospital.  She is thrashing and contorting her face and body in remarkable ways.  Surely this woman is in for a lengthy asylum visit.  But she is in fact going to be the first patient on which young Dr. Carl Jung (Michael Fassbender) will be trying his new method of Psychanalysis (yes, t that's what he calls it at first).  He places Spielrein in a chair and sits behind her and encourages her to talk.  Soon, she is confronting her demons and confessing some pretty lurid sexual feelings, including the pleasure she receives from humiliation and physical punishment.  From here, A DANGEROUS METHOD swings back and forth between being an interesting case study of the relationship between Jung and Spielrein and an intellectual tug of war between Jung, and his older mentor Sigmund Freud (Viggo Mortensen).  In the first instance, we see that the rigid divide between patient and doctor is not quite so settled in 1904.  Jung continues to treat Spielrein, but because she has a keen intellect and interest in her own treatment, he puts her to work as a research assistant.  And we also see their relationship teetering towards something even more than professor & student.  In the second instance, there are dinner table conversations and exchanged letters between Jung & Freud, wherein Jung challenges Freud to think beyond the confines of everything in psychoanalysis (as Freud calls it) relating to sex.  These Jung vs. Freud exchanges are INTERESTING.  They don't make for very exciting ENTERTAINMENT, however.  They feel a bit turgid.  Jung is, in many ways, such a fussbudget that he is incapable of small talk and only wants to challenge his mentor.  Freud, the elder statesman, isn't particularly inspired to fight back vigorously.  He is looking for a successor to himself and fancies that Jung will be such...but he also doesn't seem to embrace his role as inspiration and mentor.  He mostly seems vaguely bemused...at least until the relationship between Jung & Spielrein has a direct impact on the relationship between Jung & Freud.  The movie is certainly interesting in that much of it is true, including word for word readings of the correspondence between these two influential men.  But the movie fails to be emotionally gripping on almost any level.  The relationship between Jung & Spielrein is never gripping, as both of these people are driven by passions out of their control, and frequently come across as being acted UPON rather than making choices and deciding on actions.  And the relationship between Jung & Freud comes across like a well-acted reenactment in a TV documentary about the two men.  This is all the more disappointing, because with a director like David Cronenberg at the helm, I had hoped for more twisted sparks.  I think he was constrained by the stage-bound screenplay, and perhaps felt the emotional turmoil surely roiling in these characters would play more than it does.  It is simply too far below the surface most of the time.  Mortensen's role is fairly small, and we really only have the tiniest glimpse into Freud's life.  Fassbender is clearly a smart actor who understands the man he is playing on a very intellectual level, but what's missing is the sense that he is truly INHABITING his character...which is a shame, because Fassbender is such a terrifically physical actor.  Knightley has by far the flashiest role, and she is generally quite good.  Her character is the most interesting...and when reading the closing comments about what happens to each character...it's almost enough to make you want to read much more about her.  In many ways, this is the most \\"grown up\\" character Knightly has played.  She truly has a chance to mature into a woman.  A DANGEROUS METHOD is gorgeously filmed, and many of the locations are the actual locations these events took place.  The pace is fairly brisk.  It is never uninteresting...but I really wanted to care more about these people.  It's tough to actually recommend this film to a general audience...if the subject matter is of particular interest to you, then you should probably see it.
B0062NAX1U|2.0|The idea of this movie is great and message is well taken... But did not like that women played little role in christian life as stated, and too much preaching (even though I am a christian, I feel the preaching was too much and unreal).
B002ZG98FU|3.0|The Good:  the plot about an up-and-coming young professional woman with \\"moxie\\", working with the old stick-in-the-muds isn't bad, and it's very upbeat in the end.  Other young professionals struggling to find a career in the working world, amongst the old-guard who have a guaranteed job, may find this compelling.  The part where Rachel McAdams starts putting the morning show cast in adventurous and dangerous situations, for ratings, is actually pretty funny.  The Bad: (1) A very adultish PG-13 with lots of vulgar language; which makes it more a \\"soft R\\" for adults than a movie for teens. The F word used several times and several near-times (were they going for an R or just wanting to push the edge of the PG-13 category?), some nasty vulgar sexual and scatalogical references by Harrison Ford's crusty old pompous character, calling people a**hole, saying \\"suck ##\\"  etc.  So if you're an adult and want to watch it with other adults, that's fine, but I'd advise not to watch it with your 13 year old.  (2) The title.  \\"Morning Glory\\" seems like a Sunday or Christian or at least an innocent kind of phrase.  In reality there's a lot of worldly vulgarity and jerkiness in this movie that's not at all what the title might suggest(see #1). (3) Annoyance factor: some people might get annoyed by McAdams' frenetic energy throughout.  Though it's a personal preference, many might think she's a little too hyped up in this movie. (4) Her \\"romantic\\" relationship with Patrick Wilson is not developed at all, to the point that one thinks, why is it even in there?  They just have dinner (they say, but you have to take their word for it because it's not even shown) and jump into the sack.  Is that par for the course these days for twenty-somethings? Her friendship/work relationship with Harrison's character is really the focus of the story, but that's not romantic, and so this couldn't really be called a romantic comedy!  The pretty ...... Rachel McAdams of course.  Radiant actually, ifyou like to stare at pretty, high-energy women in their prime beauty who smile a lot.  (Great dimples!) Actually, Dianne Keaton also has a great, radiant smile for someone twice McAdam's age.  But McAdams really shines, and you can see that the director goes out of his way to film her beauty often, whether walking fast in stylish slit skirts or running in high heels.  So once again, some might see this movie as a fluffy plot vehicle to display Ms. McAdams personal charisma, beauty and charm.  And certainly compared to Harrison Ford's crotchety, vulgar and annoying sourness as a foil.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|This movie rocks from start to finish. I am a planet the Apes fan from the begining, and I can honestly say this is the best one. I ordered the movie when it came out on amazon and recieved it within a couple days. Great movie....The video presentation is outstanding....the audio sounds great. There are a bunch of special features that people will love. Go and buy it now!!!!
B005LAIIS0|3.0|THE GREY is an okay movie.  If I tell you the basic story, you'll think it's just a typical pulp action film...but the quality of cinematography, sound, script and acting elevates it to something a bit loftier.  As I watched it, I appreciated the effort the filmmakers were putting into this.  An element of existentialism that you can actually feel on an emotional level.  Yet at the same time, the film has people doing some incredibly stupid things, akin to what teenagers in slasher flicks might do.  Couching unexplainable behavior within an \\"artsy\\" framework doesn't make it any easier to swallow.  Liam Neeson is introduced working at a far northern Alaska installation.  His job is as a sniper of wolves, keeping the compound safe from these dangerous predators.  He's also contemplating suicide, but holds off at the last moment.  Thus, he ends up on an ill-fated flight from the installation.  The plane goes down in the middle of nowhere, leaving about seven survivors amidst the wreckage.  It is during these post-crash scenes that we truly get to see what a natural, physical leader Neeson's character is.  He barks orders that quickly organize the survivors and he sternly but gently attends the dying moments of a passenger as he bleeds out.  The death is looked upon in a series of powerful close-ups...and the stage is set that this isn't merely a movie in which a death is simple and unemotional.  The scene has power, and it also serves as the moment when the other survivors (for the most part) embrace the notion that Neeson is going to be their leader.  Soon, they discover that their wrecked fuselage is being stalked by man-eating wolves.  So Neeson decides that instead of waiting for possible but unlikely rescue in the plane and facing the wolves there, he suggests they grab what supplies they can and head for a tree line off in the distance, because he thinks the wolves MIGHT leave them alone if they think the men are leaving their territory.  This is a central decision, because most of the film follows thereafter...and yet it is not for ONE SECOND convincing.  It is stupid on the face of it.  Yes, wolves are stalking them...but they are in a location which provides some shelter from the HARSH wintry conditions, they have food and luggage to rummage through (which they never thoroughly do...who's to say someone wasn't carrying a satellite phone in their bag?) and it seems unlikely the wolves would swarm en masse into a giant steel structure.  And wouldn't large, ragged pieces of steel make excellent weapons against the wolves?  Instead, the men set out on foot in the hopes the wolves will leave them alone.  To say they made the wrong choice is understating matters (this is hardly a spoiler...it's what the film is ABOUT).  In my mind, Neeson is instantly established as a charismatic, tough-talking, tough-minded, physically adept FOOL.  Once they have made this choice, what follows are a series of man vs. man & man vs. nature encounters.  The characters are all nicely sketched, and some, such as the ex-con presented by Frank Grillo, are actually very well-rounded.  The men bond.  They fight.  They endure.  They make ever more desperate choices.  And the movie actually asks some big questions about death and facing death.  The manner in which we chose to go out...when given a choice.  As I said, it's more existential than you might expect.  There is less action and more contemplation that some viewers probably expect.  It's refreshing that the film would take the time to explore some of the moral quandaries it does.  And it ends more logically than I would have expected, given some of the dumb choices from earlier in the film.  I got past the terrible decision making early in the film, because I appreciated the excellent technical filmmaking throughout.  Director Joe Carnahan has given us a mean, unforgiving film...not a soft adventure where you can predict 10 minutes into it who will live and who will die.  But even with all the good things I just said, THE GREY is lacking.  Just little things.  The weather is incredibly cold, yet frostbite and exposed faces is a non-issue.  A wolf viciously attacks one man, yet when the wolf is fought off, the man has virtually no injuries...yet in an earlier, similar scene, the victim is torn apart.  There are just enough annoying inconsistencies, coupled with the one really bad initial decision to have pulled me out of really committing to this film.  It's ultimately a three-star, just barely recommend for me.
B004FQX5CK|4.0|Classic movie looks great on blu ray. Would not be what it is without Harrison Ford. Excellent movie, would recommend it
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|Owen Wilson is wonderful as Woody Allen's stand-in, in this comedy of a young couple in Paris who have much different priorities.  He is entranced by Paris and it's history of attracting writers and philosophers.  His character is what Woody Allen played on-screen in his younger days, and Wilson pulls it off perfectly.  His fiance (the ever attractive Rachel McAdams), conversely, wants to shop, party and dance.  He gets tired of hanging out with her wealthy, consumerist parents and their pedantic know-it-all snob friend played expertly by Michael Sheen.  (BTW Sheen's character is just the sort of funny and pompous character that Woody Allen excels at putting in his movies, which you don't find in films done by virtually any other director.)  Wilson starts wandering around late at night and stumbles into a magical spot in the city where he gets a ride from an old-style limo, and the mystical fun begins, with his trips back to the twenties, meeting Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein etc.  Leave it to Allen to craft a light comedic movie that blends the life of the modern leisure class with 1920's nostalgia and intellectualism, all in a nice packet of personalities, with a dose of romance and magic thrown it.  I highly recommend it for a bit of light-hearted escapism.  As for its PG-13 rating, I really can't remember why it wouldn't be rated just a PG.  I would say that it is for adults mainly because of its intellectual and historical tone, but it's more family-friendly than many other movies with the PG-13 label (contrast with some PG-13s like 1408, Morning Glory, The Ring etc).

B003X2O6KW|4.0|Overhyped for sure, but not a bad album. When i saw this atop of Spin and Vertigo's lists I was shocked. It's good but it did not change or highlight my year whatsoever.  I separate this cd into two pieces: the singles, and the rest. The singles are boring and frustrating for me. \\"All of the Lights\\" and \\"Power\\" do nothing for my ears.  My admiration is for the tracks \\"Gorgeous\\", \\"Hell of a Life\\", \\"So Appalled\\", \\"Runaway\\", \\"Devil in a New Dress\\", and \\"Blame Game.\\" I'm not sure where \\"Monster\\" fits, I've always had mixed feelings for it.<br /><br />This is a great album, but for different reasons to different people. Either way, you are sure to enjoy something here. If you are like me, and can't stand the radio play, listen to the rest of the album.
0062011847|5.0|I heard Terry Pratchett say in an interview that he is suffering from early onset Alzheimer's disease.  Well, in spite of that, his latest sojourns into the congenial and comical discworld spinning through the cosmos just seems to keep getting better and better.  His style has changed ever so slightly, but with hilarious results.  This latest entry revolves around the long suffering commander of the Ankh Morepork city watch, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes, who is forced into taking a vacation with his beloved wife and son.  When the commander reaches the ancestral home of his wife, Lady Sybil, it doesn't take him long to realize that something is not right.  After the town \\"Magistrates\\" tried to frame him for the murder of a goblin girl  Sam Vimes does what any reasonable Ankh Moreporkian copper would do.  He grabs the law with both hands, stretches and bends it to a more likable shape, then wears it like a suit of goldish armor.  He then subverts the local constable to his way of thinking, grabs Willikens, and all threeof them go after the bad guys in true disc world fashion.  whether he is on water or on land, or even below ground, he pursues his quarry wherever they take him.  On the way he picks up enemies and friends alike, the attention of Havelock Vetinari, and the occasional bacon sandwich.  Not as funny as some of Pratchett's earlier works, but truly satisfying, like the aforementioned bacon sandwich.  If you are a fan of the disc World Series, then I recommend this book wholeheartedly.  If you are one of the seven people on the planet who has not run across disc World Series in the past I suggest you start from the beginning and work your way through the myriad of books this man has written about this flat world swimming through space on a giant turtle. Carry on Mr. Pratchett,you are truly one-of-a-kind!
086571701X|5.0|We have been involved in backyard aquaponics for a few years now and have several books on the subject, and we still gained several ideas to improve our system from this book. An excellent purchase!  Sylvia writes with humour and in a style that is easy to read and enjoyable. She uses graphics and tables to compare different gravel types, system designs, lights, fish etc so that you can easily see the characteristics, benefits and fall backs of each - very useful! She also discusses aspects of aquaculture that \\"start-up manual\\" type books ignore - such as how to control pests on your vegetables (because you can't just spray them with toxins)or adjust and control pH and nutrients for plant growth without impacting on your fish quality.  If you want detailed step-by-step 'blueprints' on how to build your first system, this book may not give you the floor plans you are looking for. But every budding aquaponics gardener should still buy this book because it has pearls of wisdom in it that will save you time, money and tears. If this book doesn't inspire you to save the world, nothing will ;)
B004UID2LC|5.0|this app is great! dunno why people are complaining about the mp3 issue, it hasn't happened to me yet. I love it.
0385738773|4.0|*SPOILERS*  I really am very torn on my feelings for this book.  I cannot deny how amazingly written this book is written.  Everything throughout the whole book is so vivid, I could picture the scene, I could hear the chaos, but mostly I could feel the characters emotes, whether grief or the rare joy.  However, this was also one of my turnoffs about this book, it makes you very sad.  I ached for Thomas being the one having to pull the trigger on Newt, for cautiously yearning for Teresa until her last breath, and to going numb to his own emotions.  The Death Cure is an intense roller coaster of emotions and is not a feel good book.  But as in any book, there are flaws. I mean after all that has happened to everyone, Mr. Dashner decides to end the book, Brenda and Thomas kissing under the sunset of Flare-free Paradise? REALLY?!?!?! And the fact that the chancellor of Wicked just happen to feel bad and leave Thomas a map of the building, and a flat trans? I am a fan of happy endings, but after everyone who has died, all the trails, and the never ending pain, it seems too happy. Even in the messed up futuristic world, it seems highly doubtful, and way too easy. I just do not know how to react to that, and why Brenda, it may be just me, but I never really liked her (Teresa seems like a better fit).  Overall, this book doest really bring me any closer to a ending, just opens up more wounds and doors.  BOTTOM LINE:   If you are looking for closure, The Death Cure does not contain much.  But you can't deny that is  a impeccably written piece of literature, just not a happy go lucky one.  I would recommend it

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|We no longer have the \\"chase\\" in this book since Fifty and Ana are now married. Their love is still very HOT and they are adjusting to married life. Their funny funny emails are still in this book. Fifty still makes me want to kill him and hug him all at the same time. I get the impression that Ana has come onto her own it seems all the men she meets think she is beautiful which is great because next to Fifty she needs to have something of her own! I wish the bank scene would have been a little longer to really make us fidget and worry I felt it all happened way to fast. The things he does for Ana in such detail just shows how much he loves her. He has come a LONG way and it is wonderful to see him finally open up to her. As much as I love them I hope this is the end because James gives such a nice closure to the story that I would be nervous that another book would take us in a different direction.(well maybe a WHOLE book in his POV)  All in all I felt it was a fantastic read, thank you for giving us Fifty Ms. James!!
B005DF2QMC|1.0|The idea of transferring my audio cassettes to digital really appeals to me, but the amount of time to import each track in real time, and then add song title, artist and any other tagging information I might want...well it is just to much.

0471702188|1.0|I had been recommended this book by many people, and it ended up confusing me more and I found it way too theoretical and conceptual. I think it is more helpful for people with a consulting background, or highly academic people who are adept at understanding various concepts and re-applying them. But if you are like myself where actual real world examples and doing it for yourself is more helpful, and you want the simple basics of just what you need to know versus an X number of variations on a topic. this book wont be for you either.

B004BLJQOK|5.0|This is the second version of the first movie \\"Let The Right One In\\". The director of this movie put a different twist in this version and it still shines as the first movie in my opinion. The part of the girl just turned taking her own blood is abit off track and the part of Vampires igniting from being exposed to the sun is not correct as well. Vampires do not feed off themselves and they don't combust either...but that is just the typical hog-wash people want to believe about Vampires and that they are \\"mythical\\". I still enjoy this movie as it is a love story and about a 12 year old girl who was turned into a Vampire and how she copes with her new exsistance. Try to put yourself in her head and you will see what a Vampire has to go through everyday forever. It's not like it is written in books or movies...but this one gives a deeper insight on the life of Vampires. This is an excellent movie for anyone's collection.

B004L3AQFG|1.0|I walked out of the living room 15 minutes into the film.  I have little interest in films, stories etc.. that celebrate stupid people. John Farnham has his four rules of stupid. 1) don't be stupid, 2) don't do stupid things, 3) don't go to stupid places and 4) don't associate with stupid people.  Let's see, this guy goes into the desert alone, no real supplies, first aid, or any support system. On top of that, he doesn't leave word, note, phone anything to anyone about where he's going and or when to expect him back.  Sorry, like the four gun rules you can sometimes get away with breaking the four rules of stupid but when you break two, nothing good is going to happen.  People who callously wander off into dangerous places without planning deserve the fate that awaits them.

0316017930|4.0|Gladwell has a writing style that I and many others enjoy to read. In his 3rd book on sociological/psychology themes, he explores \\"Outliers\\". Those extraordinary individuals who lie outside the statistical norm. His main premise is stated in his own words: \\"the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways other cannot.\\"<br /><br />His book is divided into 2 parts using his trademark style of presentation of vignettes and short case studies of personages.<br /><br />Part I Opportunity - An innate ability combined with \\"chance\\" to develop(practise) it where other people do not.<br /><br />Part 2 Legacy - growing up in the proper supportive environment to further support the thesis from part 1<br /><br />This is not his best work, but an overall good effort compared to his other 2 books I have read [[ASIN:0316010669 Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking]] & [[ASIN:0316346624 The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference]] which are much better. It is pretty much common sense that people who are born with an innate ability, have the proper environment to grow up in, a certain amount of \\"luck\\" or \\"Chance\\" and work hard becomes successful people or in his book the real \\"Outliers\\".<br /><br />If you like Gladwell's writing style, this is another one of his fine books to read.

B005SS2QXS|5.0|The Protector is a silicon cover, meant to take some of the shock of a drop and protect the iPhone casing and glass from scrapping.  I read a number of reviews before choosing this type of case protector and this one was well recommended especially for the regular cost of $20.  The case is smoother/less grippy than most silicon covers I have used which means it slides into my back pocket easily.  The black cover does show lint but it does blow/wipe off easily, but there is still enough texture to grab easily.  This cover is one of the few where the speaker and port is not obstructed so it can be docked easily without flipping the case or removal.  The cover goes on like a second skin just don't over stretch when putting it on and on removal. For the cost, the cover is a steal.  Eventually I would like to get other colors for my phone.

0316044695|5.0|\\"Because in the end, your enemy must ultimately fear you, understand your supremacy.\\"-Marcus Luttrell. This was a quote taken directly from this book that for some reason stuck out like no other to me, all the way through. Marcus Luttrell has told a great story, from first hand experience, how he and three other of his SEAL teammates faced enormous odds on the moutains of Afghanistan. Sadly, three of his teammates were lost on this  mission, but the way they died was nothing less than heroic. Thanks to this book, this story, these men will not be forgotten. I don't want to forget the guys who also were shot down trying to get to Murphy's Ridge. After Murphy realized the situation he and his men were in, he went out in the open while the battle was going on and made a cell phone call to HQ and reported that, \\"My guys are dying out here...We need help!\\" Unfortunately, he was hit again for the second time but even after that, he held the left flank of their defense perimeter and made his last stand. There's an all too familiar quote, \\"Only the dead have seen the end of war\\" When I think of this quote, I think of what Murphy said to Luttrell while in his last moments. \\"Help me Marcus! Please help me!\\" Marcus Luttrell mentions that this haunts him to this day. Luttrell probably mentions this also just to show how tough SEALs really are! Just about everyone of these guys were hit, but they never gave up! They were outnumbered by odds of 35 to 1 and were able to reduce this taliban force down to about 50 percent before the battle was over. Anyway, I don't want to give too much away about this book but I will tell anyone and encourage everyone to read this book! To the guys who fought and died there, you will never be forgotten all because one man walked through the valley of the shadow of death and returned to tell your story! Thumbs Up! Marcus Luttrell

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This is a nice hard cover shell for your Kindle Fire. It snaps in perfectly and will protect your Fire from minor abuses (like throwing it in your backpack).  The stand works ok. I get a little nervous that the slightest bump will send the case collapsing because it doesn't seem super secure when you're watching a movie. But not a big deal.  As for looks, this thing is nice because it is not overly bulky. Probably one of the nicer looking cases out there.

1451627289|5.0|As a history nerd, I was really interested in reading this latest Stephen King novel.  I have never read a Stephen King novel before, so I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I was so pleasantly surprised.  It was a great read!  On the last day, I just couldn't put it down!  Just like so many people, I have wondered what would happen if we could reverse past events to change the course of history.  If we did change major events, would the world be a better place?  Not necessarily.  Even though the past event was so tragic and affected people and the world negatively, worse things might happen if that event doesn't occur.  He kept using the word \\"obdurate\\" - the \\"past is obdurate.\\"  Maybe it was so stubborn because it knew what the future would hold if the past was changed.  Ahh, this book just really made me think!  It was just such a good book!  I can't wait until my husband reads it, so I have someone to discuss it with! :-)

B005I6EU7U|5.0|i have had compliments on my cover i'm very happy with it! The only negative i can think of is that is that i wish it could prop up the kindle better like some of the other covers i've seen but it's not too much of a hardship to just lean it on things
B001FB55L2|5.0|This movie is one of the most powerful I have seen. My husband came back from a 13 month tour in Afghanistan with severe PTSD, and this movie was a very good (but not too graphic) display of what PTSD can do to a person. The actors were perfect, making the heart wrenching story feel real. I recommend this movie with no hesitations. If you watch this, pay attention to the quote at the end. It will stay with you forever.
0194313425|4.0|Despite to wait so much and to pay expansive taxes, the book arrived in very good terms. The book is very good instrument to learn English, its grammar and language in all aspects. It's a small book, and not so heavy to carry wherever. Thank's Amazon.com.

0307891372|4.0|Lovely guide. Really. However the sheer amount of the material it must cover has (understandably) led to some editorial oversights.  My main beef is the index. While the index generally does its job, quest names have been sorted in an odd manner. For example, the side quest \\"Missing in Action\\" is filed under \\"S\\" for \\"Side Quest: Missing in Action.\\" Now, the Skyrim quest log does not conveniently sort quests in this manner. If I wanted to know about this quest, I would first look under \\"M\\", not \\"S.\\" I don't think it would have killed Prima to include it under both \\"Side Quest: ...\\" and \\"Missing in Action.\\" Yes, the index would've been longer, but it would have been more usable, too.  As it stands, there are a few other omissions that I have come across in the Thieves Guild faction section, which mentions stages of guild progression but never seems to go into what constitutes each stage and how one advances the guild through it. (Maybe I missed it? Please let me know if I am mistaken.)  You really do get wonderful value for your money with this guide. Yes, the binding is cheap and the cover is easily bent, but you get over 600 pages of information for under 20 bucks. You're paying for a conveniently packaged and wonderfully researched guide for an incredibly massive game. I prefer to not have to switch between applications while playing, and this guide generally lets me do that. While most information can and probably will be easily found on the Skyrim wiki, this guide is already mostly complete (and most importantly, imo, offline).

B004HEXSLI|5.0|I heard about Jill Bolte Taylor on an Oprah podcast and have listened to the podcast countless times. I decided to buy her book and am in love with her philosophy. This is a woman who has definitely reached heights of awareness most of us can only aspire to. Her compassion for the human condition and the amount of love she has for life and for her own mother emanates from every page. I love this book and i love Jill Bolte Taylor's TED talk - it's by far my favorite ever TED talk.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This cover is perfect.  Although I did expect the cover would be softer (the back is hard plastic), it exceeded my expectations.  I did not have the same issues as other reviewers with the standing function.  Mine never slips or falls over.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|This version has it all!! The original theatrical release and the Director's cut all in one! Sorry to all you film geeks out there but I for one love the narrated version of Bladerunner much better than the Director's cut! Call me an 80s teen who loves to be handheld, but Harrison Ford did a great job helping the viewer get into the thoughts of his character! Highly recommended to all you fans of one the greatest sci-fi's ever made! Why? Because Ridley Scott's vision of the future is one of the few that appears to be coming true (give or take 100 years!)!
B003ES5ZTG|3.0|I liked the concept of the cables but had problems with the implementation.  I was really pleased with the idea, but had problems a few weeks after I started using them with \\"digital artifacts\\" on some channels from my HD TV box.  Since they were brand new cables and we had been having off and on problems with the HD box, I didn't even suspect the cables.  But after going around with the cable company for a bit and setting up a service call, I decided to change out cables just to be sure.  I tried a few other cables and all the others worked fine, but every time I switched back to the AmazonBasics cable I had the artifacts show up.  I ended up switching back to a regular cable.  I purchased these so they would tuck back nicely behind my TV and not stick out visibly from the side (which they did) but I figured if they were going to give me problems it wasn't worth it.  So I returned them.  I *may* have simply had a bad cable, but I didn't want to go through the hassle since I had some working cables available.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I wanted to read something catchy and light and found this trilogy exceeded my expectations. I'm not a sci-fi/fantasy person, but I really enjoyed all three of these books. The author did a great job of keeping you guessing while not being too cliche. The first book was, in my opinion, the best. In all books, I found the characters well developed for this genre/audience and the plot is sophisticated enough without being confusing.  I read these via the Kindle version and while I noticed what some other reviewers said regarding formatting, I didn't care. It wasn't that big of a deal and you can easily modify the text size on a Kindle anyhow. I certainly wouldn't let it be a deterrent.  Great young adult reading and good for upper-intermediate students of the English language.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I bought my netbook Emachines 355 at Spain, very good but just 1 GB RAM. After some research, I decide to buy this memory to double my RAM and take it to the limit. Delivered on time and in very good condition, I installed it and worked perfectly, no troubles and my Windows is running much better since then. Recommended for most netbooks that comes with 1 GB of RAM.

B0047CPB42|4.0|I didn't see Shutter Island on the movie circuit, mainly because it looked scary, and I tend to avoid scary movies. But I did catch it on DVD recently after my brother assured me it was more of a psychological thriller than a horror movie. The story held me spell-bound, and I was dumbfounded at the ending, so much so that I watched it again, to see if I had missed anything, but no. That's when I purchased the book, to try to get into the heads of the main characters, and that helped a lot. This is one of those books that you will still be thinking about days after you have read it, and I plan to read it again in a few months. I would recommend it to anyone who knows that in the end, everyone finds their own way of making peace with themselves.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I don't typically go for movies of this nature, but when my 41 year old daughter told me how much she enjoyed it, I decided I should check it out. I concur, it is a great, entertaining movie.
B000002L9M|3.0|I am puzzled as to why this is so consistently considered to be 'the' watershed Depeche Mode album, the pivotal moment in their career, the reference for everything before (\\"not bad for Pre-Black Celebration DM\\") to everything after it (\\"this is their best since Black Celebration\\"). To be sure, it's a good album, and some of the songs here are absolute classics in the DM canon. But for me, it's more of a slight variation in sound than the grand transformation it's touted to be.<br /><br />I've noticed that many people who worship Black Celebration think of DM's older work as dated. So, even if the preceding album, Some Great Reward, had other great qualities, the songs couldn't help sounding gimmicky, \\"tinny,\\" cheesy, etc. This, I think, is the main barrier that prevents people from realizing just how much of BC owes to Some Great Reward.<br /><br />You see, to me, Some Great Reward is that pivotal moment. The birth of most aspects of Depeche Mode's style that we have come to know and love. The early work is great too, but Some Great Reward saw the debut of a Depeche Mode that was dark, mysterious, theatrical, and sensual. Here, Dave Gahan became a much more expressive singer, ranging from a predatory croon to histrionic bellows, and Martin Gore provided the band's first tender ballad, not to mention his first stab at lead vocals. It's true that they were still enamored with synthesizers and samples, but the arrangements were much fuller and more atmospheric than in previous albums. There was sex, violence, cynicism, and dark drama. For all intents and purposes, Some Great Reward set the blueprint for almost every Depeche Mode album to come.<br /><br />Black Celebration's title track is a terrific opener, and has an effectively dour atmosphere to it, but its arrangement, especially that Philip Glass-like organ arpeggio, is clearly a variation of the one used for \\"Something to Do,\\" the opener for Some Great Reward. \\"Sometimes\\" is, to me, a lesser version of the original Gore ballad \\"Somebody,\\" with similar name and all. The closest song to a synth dance track on BC (New Dress) is like a moodier remix of \\"Master & Servant.\\" Even BC's best moment, the slow building dramatic heights of centerpiece \\"Stripped,\\" could have fit quite comfortably on Some Great Reward, alongside \\"If You Want\\" and \\"Blasphemous Rumors.\\"<br /><br />Still, Black Celebration does progress from the innovations of its predecessor. The main difference is the relative lack of samples and synth arrangements that formerly served as DM's stock in trade, in favor of a more expansive--albeit conventional--sound. A consequence of this is that it's rather light on the stomping anthems, and heavy on the ballads. I can appreciate that some people just like the constant bleak atmosphere of BC, but I can't understand how an album that is supposed to be Depeche Mode's defining moment has so few songs that actually make you want to move your body! No track to rival their earlier anthems, or later ones like \\"Strangelove\\" and \\"Personal Jesus.\\" It's true that the album feels cohesive, with a consistent moodiness running throughout. But it also lacks contrast, and its less distinctive moments (Dressed in Black, World Full of Nothing) make the album drag.<br /><br />Also, the claim that this is the first DM album that doesn't sound dated confuses me. Sure, the synth stabs of their first few albums scream 1980's, but so does the cavernous reverb that drenches ballads like \\"A Question of Lust.\\" That was a tried and true sound for ballads in the 80's. Perhaps this cavernous quality was intended as a reference to the early 60's sound of records produced by Phil Spector (the rhythm and castanets of The Ronettes'\\"Be My Baby\\" come to mind), but if that's the case, the accusation of being dated vs classic just seems to be an arbitrary distinction to me.<br /><br />To those of you who think Black Celebration's more conventional arrangements keep the songs from from being \\"cheesy,\\" lyricslike \\"death is everywhere, there are flies on the windscreen, for a start, reminding us we could be torn apart...tonight\\" should remind you that Depeche Mode have never escaped some level of cheesiness, even in Violator and beyond. Depeche Mode is known for their high drama, and to pull that off so consistently means that sometimes standards of good taste are violated. So if you're willing to put up with some silly lyrics once in a while, why can't you handle the synth stabs of Some Great Reward?<br /><br />I hate to rag on what is a decent album with some great songs, but the fact that this is so unquestionably regarded as their first classic album bothers me. The largest innovations that it brought relative to its predecessor (a move away from synth pop or industrial dance) are only important if you have hang-ups about early 80's synth sounds. I for one, relish the rhythms and textures of \\"classic\\" synth pop. Because of this, I am more open to the important innovations of Some Great Reward, and think of BC's own innovations as being a bit of a let-down, especially the lack of danceable anthems.<br /><br />A minority opinion, apparently, but one that I feel deserves consideration., for a start, reminding us we could be torn apart...tonight\\" should remind you that Depeche Mode have never escaped some level of cheesiness, even in Violator and beyond.

B004A8ZWXS|5.0|I'm not sure if this is a movie about a horse, or about war, or about class divisions, or what... I don't care, it was wonderful from any perspective. I took my 5 youngest children, ages 9 to 13, and they all loved it as much as I. As a parent, it was great to have such a well done opportunity to talk about the First World War, and the other discussions it led to. I greatly appreciated that all of the soldiers,German and Allies, were shown as people with lives and needs, none were worse than the other, they all suffered.<br /><br />The visual aspects of the movie were incredible and worth an Oscar nomination.I won't watch this again though, it was too emotional, but that speaks for the power of the movie.
1557048630|3.0|I have on hand both of the Kung Fu Panda art books and thought I would pick this one up as well . I was sadly disappointed at the lack of content compared to the two Art of Kung Fu Panda art books. The character bios were short if anything at all. Skimped on the drawings and overall in depth look we have for the Kung Fu Panda series. Normally, there would be a reference for characters in both sketch and CGI stills. Not in this one. It's mostly just sketch work. It feels they just spread the material out thin in this book. A few drawings here a still or two and there and a small paragraph or two tossed in.

0446547654|4.0|This is one of those \\"uptown girl, downtown man\\" stories. A story about a girl, Amanda and a guy, Dawson who based on everyone else's opinions didn't belong together. But love doesn't know names or status and it never truly goes away. So when Amanda and Dawson meet up, years after their young love had been stamped out by a truth neither one was willing to accept, they must come face-to-face with the path they had chosen not to go down so many years ago.<br />Nicholas Sparks has a way of getting you sitting at the edge of your seat. At a certain point in the story, around page 200, he gets all of the character's viewpoints going, preparing for something big to happen. Everyone's moving around, setting something into motion, and the suspense is killing you at this point. And you're not quite sure what will happen next but with all possible pieces in play you know that something HUGE is just around the corner. You're going to be surprised. You're going to be shocked. And you cross your fingers that you're going to be relieved.<br /><br />Right then and there Sparks has you...he has your attention, he has your heart and you're flipping frantically through the pages not sure what outcome you want to find. By now you've narrowed down the options...you've figured out what you've got to work with and then your left to feel a little bit whole...a little bit hollow, and not quite sure if you're content or completely pissed off at the outcome.<br /><br />This is how Sparks' books...more often than not, end up unfolding. And The Best of Me was no different.<br />The characters lives and fate both lie in one another's hands and they're so wrapped up...you end up caring about so many of them and you just don't know what to do with yourself.<br /><br />Needless to say I cried when I finally read the last sentence. Yes...it was that poetic, to have a single tear rolling down from each eye as I closed the book. And maybe that's what Sparks envisioned when he pictured readers finishing the story. It was written in a tangled way in which any ending would have been tragic, it would have meant loss of some kind and while it was a beautiful story, I'll tell you right now, I do like how it ended. In a selfish way really. I'm not a mother yet...only a lover. So I can only understand the grief of a mother to a certain point. I married my one true love and I ignored when everyone voiced their concerns about age and rushing into things. So in Amanda I see who I might have been had I walked away from my husband based on the concerns around me that young love wasn't meant to last.<br /><br />I'll stop there, I don't want to ruin the story for anyone but I have to admit that I walked away from this read completely undecided how I really felt about it.led way in which any ending would have been tragic, it would have meant loss of some kind and while it was a beautiful story, I'll tell you right now, I do like how it ended.

B003YFIUW8|3.0|I thought the idea was fantastic up to the point of the escape (about half way).  Then I think it took a nose dive.  I lost interest because it became boring and the strength of the main character began to decrease.  Not sure if I would recommend this book to a friend.  The voice of the book- a young boy, was hard to understand at times and I was lost at a few parts.

B0060AY6FO|1.0|What a terrible waste of $12.99.  It was slow moving, full of errors and lengthy descriptions of minor characters and events.  The dialogue lacked all of the sparkle and wit that is so evident in \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" and the treatment of Mr. Darcy, Elizabeth and especially Colonel Fitzwilliam could be considered character assassination.  I was amazed to read America referred to as the \\"New World\\" particularly since it was almost two hundred years since the first English colony was established and 25 years  after the War of Independence.  Another jarring addition was mention of characters from \\"Emma\\" and \\"Persuasion\\" It seemed gratuitous to say the least.  I wish I had read the one star reviews first.

B002FU42NE|5.0|This is the second CD I ever owned. There are many great tracks on this album, including some by Nine Inch Nails, The Cure, Thrill Kill Cult, Stone Temple Pilots and Helmet. To be honest, the rest of the tracks are kind of bland, but I believe it was the best type of music the soundtrack producer could come up with at the time. This is the album which got me into The Cure. Later on I became a fan of STP as well due to this soundtrack.<br /><br />Great album overall, though there are a lot of filler songs.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is the best-produced \\"Christian movie\\" I've seen. Good acting, pacing, dialogue, photography. Lots of tear-jerking emotional scenes sprinkled with \\"high-speed chases\\" and genuinely-funny comic relief. Lots of take-away value.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|This film is a variety of things. It is witty, funny, emotive, melancholy, and genuine. Though some of the characters clearly are a little over the top (such as the managers at Adventureland), the main characters (Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart) are very down-to-earth and one can identify with them. Probably everyone has been at a similar point in their life, where they aren't sure exactly how to go forward, and where plans have fallen through, that's what the premise of the movie is based on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When i first began reading this book i thought &#34;great this is going to be one of those slow moving books that i hate but i might as well read it anyway&#34;. I am so glad i desides to finish the bokk as well as the other two books. I am the kind of person who reads very little but with the Hunger Games i could not put down the book. The description of most of the charecters and places was so well thought out that i could literally picture the whole thing in my head. Though some discriptions were veg it left room to imagine some of the story on your own without strict okah here is what everything looks like. The book, however is not for very squemish people because of the amount of deaths which are quite brutal. The cliff hangers at the end made you wonder what was going to happen in the next book along with ghe suspence throughout the book made the whe thing worth while I have been sugjesting this book to all of my friends and I sugjest you read it also.
B000VZJUGY|5.0|This album was the theme to my high school years. I was going through a lot of emotional battles at the time, with trying to understand where I fit in to society, and dealing with the death of my older brother (who actually got me into Nine Inch Nails in the first place). I think this album is one of the angriest, angstiest albums of the 90s. Kurt Cobain is great, but he has nothing on Trent Reznor's alternative style angst.<br /><br />The album almost comes off like a concept album. If it had a concept to follow, I would say it would be the concept of anger at the broken promises of society, and the lies that he's dealt with growing up and realizing life really isn't all that peachy.<br /><br />The first tracks start out pretty fast, and the album seems to slowly run out of steam, where it ends on an emotional, but very \\"final\\" sounding song entitled \\"hurt.\\" Hurt, of course was the song which was actually more popularized by Johnny Cash, than it was by Trent Reznor. The Johnny Cash recording was very good (I'm a Johnny Cash fan too). Trent even admitted that Johnny Cash did a great job on the song and was honored, but said it felt \\"invasive\\" like someone was \\"kissing your girlfriend.\\"<br /><br />If you are young and have an open mind, you will probably love this album. If you are older and set in your ways and tastes, this album might just sound like noise to you.<br /><br />I think I'll end this review with a quote from the movie Airheads \\"If it's too loud, you're too old.\\"

B005F3DFXG|5.0|Let me just say, I really hope this documentary sets a precedent for more like it to come. The effects were as good as they get, but the style is what I really enjoyed. The action shots were rendered with a hand-held cam effect, with the camera probing to find the animal, and zooming wide for scale and then close up, as if it were filmed by a real wildlife camera crew. To top it off though, additional material was presented in a hyperlink-type format, with text, images and video expanding from the original picture. Plus, scaled pictures of fossils and dinosaurs next to each other and humans were almost always offered. I absorbed the information so much better that way, rather than just hearing that T-Rex was over 12 meters, which can be distracting when your attention turns to imagining how 12 meters compares to you. This documentary was tailor-made for the digital generation; it was like the iPad of documentaries, and I sincerely hope there are many, many more to come!! Bravo, BBC!!! Like Walking with Dinosaurs, Planet Earth, etc., once again, you are setting new trends in documentary film-making.

B00005Q3TZ|4.0|I saw this film when it first came to theaters a decade ago. From the trailers, it sold you as a modern retelling of the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. What the film gives you however is a Hollywood production with Michael Bay helming it at the seat of his pants.  -- Film --  Most people here who have reviewed this film have already seen it. And you who probably seeks to understand why you want to buy this version of the film should consider a few things.  This film is a very fictional retelling of Pearl Harbor. When you watch this film, you need to remember that most (if not all) of what you see is either slightly inaccurate to greatly inaccurate. Does it mean that it makes it a bad film? From most people who are historical buffs or in general would like to see Hollywood pay respects to those service men who died during the attack - then yes.  But if you can take this film with a grain of salt and simply view it as is: Entertainment with the back drop being set in a historical setting. Then this film can be quite entertaining.  For me, I've studied this attack extensively as well as World War II itself and I know for a fact that this film is truly far from what had actually happened. Michael Bay - the film's director - it seemed was trying to convey a sense of realism through the telling of our two protoganists. By realism, I mean that the first act of the film takes place in a pre-war America.  Love is on everyone's minds as every service men and women are quite young. Michael Bay wanted to catch that moment in time where America was innocent and were not at all trying to jump on the board with the war that was going on around the world. In a sense, it worked.  The only problem is, Mr. Bay extends this sense of innocence between our two main protagonists who are both equally in love with the love interest. This love triangle is truly where it makes the film hit a few road blocks. Had he kept it between two people, then it would have been a minor rash on a film that was trying to keep with the time of that era.  Historical accuracy for the rest of the film it seems isn't the key in this film. Yes, Michael Bay keeps most things intact but are greatly twisted in the name of artistic license. During the attack sequence, in the Director's Cut, Michael Bay films it in a gritty fashion with emphasis on violence.  The violence in the attack sequence of Pearl Harbor is graphic in a very real sense and gives you a glimpse into what had happened during the attack. The Director's Cut is different from the theatrical cut that was seen in theaters. Graphic violence in which bodies and limbs are flying, bullets puncturing bodies with blood being something of a center-piece. From this, we get the prespective that Michael Bay wanted to show Pearl Harbor as it happened, however he misses the mark with some iffy writing from the first act and pure American justice (flaunted by some quick quips on friendship and American will power) in the final act before wrapping a dirty bow between the love triangle.  Bottom line is. While the film misses many marks, it still makes up for being a prime piece of entertainment that only Michael Bay could have delivered. The mere problem is, he chose the film to be set in a real historical event in which real people died.  -- Bonus Features --  I've seen most of the bonus features that are listed in the Director's Cut. Most of which are cutted into segments in which we get a sense of how the film was made. From boot camp to filming, Pearl Harbor it appeared was a titanic undertaking that Michael Bay took. There isn't just one documentary that takes you from the inception of the film to the end of production as I've enjoyed with many of Ridley Scott's works on his films. But it's enough to show you how this film was made.  -- In the End --  If you're seeking a film to quench your thirst on a historical epic with authentic precision. You're looking at the wrong film. If you're seeking a film that entertains with such high caliber entertainment - then pick this up. However, please remember that this film and others who are historically based should do their homework prior to watching films such as Pearl Harbor.
B003M98792|5.0|Not a blind buy, but I haven't seen this in years.  Thanks to the terrific blu-ray quality, bargain price and the non-stop action, this was well worth purchasing.  If you like to see ninjas getting slaughtered by the dozen, this is definitely for you!
B0015DWJX2|4.0|This one is written as a series of letters, and is part of a new wave of WW2 literature (invisible bridge, silence of trees).  The main character is a witty young femaile writer who finds her latest subject in a small, if slightly eccentric island community.  Each of the voices reads genuine and unique, and the the development of the relationships between this writer and the islanders is touching and nuanced.  This is a great read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful.  Very easy to look up book,chapter and verse. Best feature is the translation of the various versions. It makes it easy for me to explain difficult passages to my young children.
B005DOKL3E|4.0|I am very pleased with this sleeve.  It is light-weight and easy to carry, yet provides ample protection for the Kindle Fire.  Would recommend it to others.  Note: 2nd Review--just purchased a second Kindle Fire and also purchased another Kindle Fire ZIP Sleeve in a different color.  Very pleased with purchases.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|That's Enetertainment is just a super look back at wonderful singers and dancers that is appreciated my so many people. It is sad that this kind of talent will never be seen again. It is so great that these memories will not be lost for future generations.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version is so easy to use and so much fun! My new favorite way to play solitaire for sure.
B004J4WV2S|5.0|These shows have been a go-to for me over the years.  I think I started with the version 7 and haven't looked back.  I've tried others over the years, but they've never compared.  I've done countless marathons and other races in these shoes and I won't switch unless there is a very good reason
B0063GORYU|5.0|Keeps your mind jumping! Love Spider Solitaire! Easy setup and great visuals. Helps pass the dreary days of dicky winter.
B0064J6OMO|5.0|How could anyone have even wasted one single second of their life watching Hangover 2, when this movie was in existence?!?! I so wish I hadn't seen it yet so I could experience it again for the first time! The chemistry between Bateman and Reynolds is off the charts! I yearn for the day they reunite! I had my doubts about how they would pull off the \\"switch,\\" but before I even had a chance to activate my snarky \\"oh yeah, right,\\" meter, I was seamlessly suspending my disbelief.<br />If you don't believe in self-deprecating humor or dig raunchy (but oh so true to life) sarcasm, this movie probably ain't gonna sit well with your tight ass!<br />One of the best comedies in YEARS!!! I'm not a big multiple watcher, but can't wait to watch this again! And for those of you that haven't seen it yet: LUCKY!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry birds is like the best game in the history of apps. Everybody will love it if they get it.

B00461MY30|5.0|There's a lot of information here about the vinyl already, plus I doubt you need much of a review on the actual music.  But beware if you are buying this in the UK, you're likley to be liable for ~£48 VAT at customs. Its worth factoring that in when deciding where to buy it from.
1558908846|5.0|The movie had good effects for the time; also had a good mix of established actors and relatively new ones at the time. The story line was as close as a movie can get to the original comic story line and still be popular, set a good example for the endless line of comic book based movies that have been produced over the last few years.  Great entertainment.
B004SEVPWQ|5.0|Why are we always behind on updates??  Newest version is 2.0.5 we are on 2.0.3?? Amazon, get us up to date.  EVO 4G.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a great game. however the controls aren't that good, very slow and sticky. it is a very addicting game and great for passing time.
0439023521|5.0|I wasn't sure what all the rave was about but decided to read it based upon a friend's recommendation. From chapter one I was hooked. Easy read but thoroughly engrossing. I was so sad when I finished the read.

B005HSL626|5.0|people need to stop complaining about the ads I have a kindle fire and it has no lag its a great game and I love it and I have yet to see an innapropriate app on this game bandits hotly addicting love this freaking game
1567184855|4.0|I was not into this book when I first picked it up.  I skimmed it. Put it down. Then I read it again. One of the stories in there grabbed me. It seemed like good literature, and then it seemed TRUE. Can't explain it. But curiosity set it. I went looking for a hypnotist. \\"By coincidence\\" I found a past life regression therapist ten minutes away from where I live. I had a session. Now I KNOW. Skepticism gone.<br /><br />I guess the point is that one has to experience life for oneself. Do it if this book speaks to you. You will not be sorry. Thank you for writing this book, Dr. Newton, wherever you are. I will never ever be the same, and I will never be afraid.
0061673730|2.0|Before I bought and read the book I had read many of the reviews herein.  I must have missed it because I didn't come away with nearly as profound of an impact and impression as many here have felt.  While intriguing (I kept looking for something new) I was mostly disappointed by the over and over again commentary on \\"Classical v Romantic\\" thinking.  I got it the first time; didn't need to re-read his position on it dozens of times.  I found the book to be very convoluted in its presentation, and I think reflects the author's own convoluted thinking and confusion about philosophy.  If you're not a student of philosophy and familiar with the works of the great ones, I think this book fails to make its mark, in that I found it not very profound, about anything, frankly.<br /><br />I found the story of his relationship with his son, actually, to be more interesting, yet that's not why I bought the book.<br /><br />I thought his leanings towards Oriental philosophy to be somewhat dated at this time, a 1970s thing (of course, at the time it was current).<br /><br />I wasn't impressed enough to want to buy any other of his books or the study guides (any book that needs a study guide, in my opinion, is not well written).  IMHO.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is really fun.  graphics are... ok, but its still really fun.  fun. fun. fun. fun. fun. fun. fun.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I deft. wouldn't pay for it but it is a neat little app. fun and great for passing time. some game are more fun gthan others, but an overall good app.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is a great game, and it challenges you so many times. I love it and it is just so fun to play!!
B004QK5N5W|4.0|This product is great if you want to stream a movie from your iPad to the TV without worrying about your iPad dying in the middle of the movie as you can plug in both the hdmi cable as well as the standard apple connector for charging.  The reason why I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the connection always seems loose. If you are moving the iPad around a lot, this connector falls out rather easily; I don't have that problem with my normal apple connector (I can move that all over the place without it falling out unless it gets snagged on something). Not really a big deal, but it is rather annoying/noticeable if you use it a lot.  If all you do is plug it in and set it aside away from movement, this works great.
0060899190|5.0|I purchased this book for my daughter. She loves it and I love the low price. It was so much more expensive in the store.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i really like its shared feature. i can write a note and have it on my phone, computer and tablet. I like that it can do photos videos audio and text. I like the way you can organize into notebooks. everything is very useful. I like it a lot.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love 101 games its so cool how its free my favorite mini game so far is the soccer one its so iddicting :)
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just like Hazel and Gus, I want to know what happens after the book ends. What's more, I desperately wish I knew them before and during. John Green gives words a musical rhythm and flow that very few authors successfully achieve. I have highlighted at least 20 different phrases and sentences in this book. TFiOS is beautiful and devastating, hilarious and heartbreaking. Vlogbrothers fans will hear John's voice on each page. He credits others with the inspiration for these characters, but I think their finest traits; humanity, compassion, humor, intelligence, and a dash of nerdy sexiness come straight from Green himself. As a fan since 2008, I am excited to see his popularity skyrocket. At the same time though, I can relate to Hazel's thoughts on An Imperial Affliction- I don't know if I want to share this book. I like the idea that it is my secret. (too late for that...) I will just have to take the other option and insist that EVERYONE I know read this book.
B002BWP49C|5.0|I'm a major Twilight fan and LOVED Breaking Dawn Part one in theaters.  I pre-ordered my dvd as soon as Amazon listed it online. I'm anxiously awaiting its arrival.
0142410705|4.0|4 1/2 Stars<br /><br />While not quite as magical as Looking For Alaska, An Abundance of Katherines was still a wonderfully quirky, sweet, and surprisingly funny book.<br /><br />Colin Singlton has an obsession with anagrams, and with girls named Katherine. He believes he has been dumped by 19 of them in his short life. After Katherine XIX breaks his heart, he and his best friend Hassan go on a road trip and find themselves spending the summer in a tiny town in Tennessee called Gutshot.<br /><br />This is only my second time reading a John Green book, and I can honestly say the man truly does live up to all the hype surrounding him. The characters he creates are so beautifully brought to live...all their quirks, and faults and insecurities feel real and very believable. In both Looking For Alaska and An Abundance of Katherines Green has created unique characters that I will always remember.<br /><br />The character of Colin does come off as winy and needy at times, but in the end I couldn't help but root for this washed up child prodigy, and the band of misfits surrounding him.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|This does make it possible to play in a smaller gaming area, but it doesn't function as well as the Kinect does alone.  I have a very small living room, so I HAVE to have this thing.  I can play the games, but this zoom lense makes every movement appear VERY jerky on screen.  It also has a hard time picking up on slight hand movements.  Don't get this item unless you really definately need it.  LIke I said, my living room is VERY small and this is my only option to be able to use my Kinect.  If I had a slightly larger space, I would not use the zoom lense.
B004ETVAH0|4.0|Saw the show on a PBS special and knew I had to have the CD. Great guitar work by Beck, of course. Addictive vocals from Imelda May. Good, though not outstanding, selection of guest artists. All in all, a satisfying CD.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play, just like with a deck of cards. No ads. Really nice on Kindle Fire. The hints help when you miss the obvious and let you know when there are no moves.
0811870413|5.0|Great book, excellent content! . Very nice photos. Interesting receips. I love it.I really recomend it.It was a christmas present, for my housband. He is a cheff.
145162445X|5.0|At first there was nothing, then there was this book, and it was good.  Well written, entertaining, and informative. Good explanations of complicated science for a more general audience.
B005WMQ5R8|5.0|The plot to this movie isn't terribly complicated.  It's your basic grandprix storyline.  You have the hero, some villains, other drivers, and the mob trying to fix the results.  What sets it apart is its execution. This film took seven painstaking years to make, and it can be seen in every frame. I cannot overstress the beauty of the animation.<br /><br />The characters were all likable. I even found myself cheering for the other drivers at certain points. The best performance came from Liam O'Brien portraying Frisby. This role really shows his range. He can go from a sociopathic killer (Gaara from Naruto) to the lovable Nightcrawler in Wolverine and the X-men. He was surprisingly nuanced for a movie that's basically an R-rated Speed Racer in the future.<br /><br />The world that it set up was very imaginative. Unlike most SciFi futuristic films, humans are not the majority species. In fact there was no single majority species. This left a lot of room for the animators to be creative with aliens that appear on-screen and in the background.  In all the art style was hat Heavy Metal wanted to be and more.<br /><br />In short, just watch this film. You will not be sorry.
0525423656|3.0|Despite many negative reviews, (Goodreads, I'm lookin' at you), Crossed was really good. If you're into poetry and romance, that is. True, this book lacked a lot to be desired by most fans, especially if you were eager to hear more about the---spoiler alert---Rising, like I was. But it was still enjoyable, none the less.  This book is pretty much a \\"middle book\\", so to speak. 90% of the book consists of C & K's oh-so-forbidden love with some literature and art thrown in.  However, Cassia and Ky are not alone; there are new characters introduced into the story. One of them being Indie, a determined and some-what psycho chick who wants to, like Cassia, join the Rising as much as an average 12 year old girl wants to score tickets to a Justin Bieber concert. `Cause, well, she's just that psycho. While narrated by both Cassia and Ky, I found it incredibly hard to tell the difference between Cassia and Ky's voice; they both sound like the same person. But, hey, great lovers think alike, right? Or, something like that.  Crossed left me feeling rather...neutral. Stuff just happened. New characters were added. I wanted to see what would happen next, and nothing much did happen. Yet, I still like it; perhaps it's due to Condie's writing. I really, really like the way she puts words together. (Did that sound odd? Probably.)  To sum things up, Crossed isn't your action-packed thriller filled with suspense and peril. Adventure? Sure. Romance? Yeah. Cliff-hangers? Tons. Which is, no matter if you liked Crossed or not, exactly why you're gonna be heading your little booty back to the bookstore to get the last book next year. Duh.  Oh. Yeah, and one other thing: Cassia is pronounced like Ke$ha. Yes, that Ke$ha.  Who woulda figured.  Plot: 2.5/5  Story: 2.5/5  Writing: 4/5  Characters: 3.5/5  Cover: 4/5  Ultimate Score: 3/5  - Jennifer
B005ETA5K2|2.0|After having a previous model of Alfa's wifi cards and loving it I decided to get this new one because it supported Windows 7 virtual wifi feature whereas the one I had didn't. Things went swimmingly during the week it operated. Then seemingly at random after calling my dog in the house, I came back and suddenly I had no internet connection. The device wasn't recognized by the computer, and it wouldn't light up. I tried another computer only to get the same lifeless response out of it.  The previous model I have still works though. Reading other reviews on this one tells me that I didn't get a bad one so much as it seems this model has a high failure rate. It's really sad honestly, because it worked VERY well. I had high connections, the range is very long, so on and so on.
B005QUQP76|5.0|First off, I'd like to say, this mouse is amazing. This totally blows my old Deathadder out of the water.<br /><br />The rubberized matte feeling on the top of the mouse is great and the sides of the mouse are textured plastic with a matte finish over them.<br />Before I bought the mouse, I was concerned about three things: Whether my hand would reach the sniper button, how ergonomic it was, and whether it was durable.<br /><br />I have to say, Corsair really addressed to all of those concerns. The sniper button is in a perfect spot, right above my thumb, but not enough so that I would struggle to reach it (Even if you don't like it at first, keep attempting to use it, your muscle will eventually remember it and it'll be very natural.)<br /><br />Obviously, the mouse is suited for right hand gamers, which I am. It conforms perfectly to the hand and is suitable for a palm grip. Finger and Claw grips might have a difficulty in using it if their hands small.<br /><br />The plastic and aluminum construction is very very solid, expect it to last a few years before breakage. And if it does break, Corsair will back it up with their outstanding warranty. 2 Years!<br /><br />Overall I really like this mouse, not much to complain about, other than the fact that it takes a bit of force to press down on the middle mouse button, not which I will do anyway.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Ergonomic<br />Very sturdy<br />Aluminum!<br />Sniper button<br />5700 DPI<br />Braided Cable<br />Textured Matte Finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />Might take a while to get used to the sniper button<br />Blue USB connector<br />Software is a bit tricky
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|good product!! pickup is good the only thing is you have tyo adjust amp or mixer to get the right sound.perfect quality mic.i love it!! : )

B003XTUZIM|5.0|Fripp and Wilson have done it again. I must admit that it took me a while to warm up to the original album a few years back. When it clicked with me, I thought that it was fantastic. Although quite different, each song has its place, and when you get immersed in the album, before you know it, it is over.  And now there is this package, which has quite a bit of bonus material. The remaster certainly contains an excellent surround mix, but in my opinion, the extras here beat extras on any of the other Fripp / Wilson reissues (although I don't have them all). The highlight is the 15 minute Sailor's Tale recorded live in Frankfurt on their opening night of the tour (April 12, 1971). This version, a quality recording, by the way, can be hunted down as a download through the Collectors' Club called DGM live, but I am not sure that it is available elsewhere. Then there are tons of rough mixes, and an excellent remix of Ladies of the Road. This package also contains a tune called Peacemaking Stint Unrolls, which basically shows what the future direction of the band would be. This one is also excellent. Anyway, I think that the surround sound here is done extremely well, but also that this package would be a worthy investment even for those without a dedicated DVD-a player because of the extras.
B00005JKNF|3.0|This whodunit is disappointing in my opinion.  Aside from the breathtaking manse and countryside, and the star-studded cast (Maggie Smith, Kristen Scott-Thomas,Helen Mirren,et al), it seems weak in many respects.  The scenes seem very rushed - almost like a cram for an exam - the dark lighting (I expect trying to be realistic for the period) was overdone. Plot was not bad but overall weak in many places.  The film does capture the eccentricities of the English - note the beautifully laid out refreshments after the shoot but with muddy, slippery floor underfoot - and also does capture the culture of that time - snobbish uppercrust gents not averse to cavorting with the female servants.  The best scene for me was the overlay of piano playing and songs while the crime was being committed with the servants really enjoying it as it drifted out to the corridor. The telephone conversation of the filmmaker from California at that time was also a bit overdone to be believable.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I really loved this App a lot &amp; then it stopped syncing all of a sudden after I added another new Tasks List on my Kindle Fire. I've tried closing apps on both Kindle &amp; Computer, changing sync settings, turning device off &amp; back on but I still get an error: 'full synchronization error, please try again later'...grrrrr. Sent email to developer so hope they answer soon. Posted error on Facebook page also.  What a let down because it was working flawlessly..up to point of adding a the new folder :( Sure hope they get this fixed? Will change to 5 stars if fixed!
B004SDEP38|1.0|I got this app and practically 30 seconds later I'm deleting it from my device.  apparently you cannot add new files unless you have the &quot;full&quot; version which is 15 dollars. that  is  15 dollars over priced!!!!! when i got this app i expected it to be useful. don't waste your time on this app. get a game or something.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|now I can remember anything as long as I have my smartphone or Kindle with me.  it is great that. I can access my notes from any device.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I haven't played solitaire for years, but am playing it  now on my tablet with a stylus and love how a tap on the card sends the card to the correct  play.  Fun!
B0064T6LV8|4.0|It works pretty well on my Kindle, but sometimes it'll freeze for a second and make me lose. But I'm fairly pleased with it...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|amazing fun and entertaining. I love this game! its great for any occasion. I love the sunshine game its self its easy and fun.
B004R13U6Y|3.0|This app is amazing, by far the best pdf reader in android. However, the \\"amazon version\\" is quite old compare the one in android market. The one from amazon is still in 1.6.0.0, however in android market it is already reached 1.7.4.0, there are huge features added for all those updates. Can Amazon actually makes sure the apps in its own market is up to date?
B002ZG981E|5.0|Another great movie with one of the best male actors of my time. Interesting idea and was executed perfectly. I'm wondering if there will be a second.....
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun game.  lots of different games to play.  kinda takes a long time to open some games though.  its free, so all the games are worth it.
B004LWZW4W|5.0|Amazing movie!!!! I was pulling for the apes in this one. Animal testing is terrible!!!!! I also received this product in a timely manner.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app. I can have the Bible everywhere I go.Thank you to the faithful creators of this mobile app! I have begun a focused reading plan. I downloaded an offline copy of the Bible so I can truly. Read the word of God no matter where I am. Sometimes I listen to the scripture readings. That is special.
0739317741|5.0|Great factual story, better than the movie. I listened to the abridged version, may have to listen to the unabridged version. I think they could have made a better movie if they had used more of the real life stories in the book.
B004L0NGEC|2.0|...this app is great. The problem comes when you get the &quot;error, try again later&quot; message for huge groups of your pictures. Only given 2 stars until its more reliable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was so riviting and intreaguing that my boyfriend became interested in this book too takkng away my kindle. And to my sulrise he started reading it too. He read half the book in a couple hours and was dying to finish it with me. This is a must read which will have your heart racing in excitement. I'm not usually a reader but I took the advise of a friend and tried it and I am not at all disappointed. Read it you'll be glad you did!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|An avid King fan, I've obviously read them all.  Like any other King fan, I've had my likes and dislikes.  Of recent works, I thoroughly enjoyed the Dome.  IMO, 11/22/63 slightly tops that.  One of the pleasures of reading fiction is being able to enjoy subjects such as time travel. I can never get enough of it, but many authors (even good ones)cannot do it justice.  SK does time travel proud in this book by both: 1) keying off of a historical event that still captivates strong emotions after all these years and 2)intertwining a cast of complex and interesting characters around that event.  Kudos all around on this one Stephen!!  No complaints from this fan.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Perfect. Hooks right up to my D90 and now i can experiment with the Bulb setting more while i do Manual HDR images. works perfectly.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Looks great and protects very well. Got this from Amazon very quick and its easy to install. My iPhone 4s looks very good with this thing on.
B001Y8WAKA|5.0|There's a lot to be said for Saxon's NWOBHM era.  Wheels of Steel, Strong Arm of the Law, and Denim and Leather are undisputed classics, second perhaps only to Iron Maiden in that era.  However, it is this album where it all comes together for Saxon, at least to my ears. The production is a little cleaner, but I wouldn't go as far to say polished. There is still plenty of grit here, and the power of the band isn't diminished one bit.  The title track is one of the best openers in metal history, a real fist-pumper with a rousing chorus. Along with closer \\"The Eagle Has Landed,\\" it's one of Saxon's most epic tracks to date (although \\"Crusader\\" wasn't far off into the future at this point). \\"Redline,\\" \\"Warrior,\\" and \\"This Town Rocks\\" are classic full-tilt Saxon rockers, whereas \\"Nightmare\\" and \\"Midas Touch\\" venture into more melodic territory.  Power and the Glory was followed by the slightly inferior Crusader, and then a few albums of mid-career sag, before staging a slight 90s comeback, and finally roaring to full-on metallic glory in the 21st century.  Their recently released Call to Arms album is their best since...well, since Power and the Glory.  Shame that this band is so underrated.
B005J29HCQ|1.0|I was very disappointed with this purchase.  I expected music and got a lot of meaningless jabber along with poor quality music.  This is not a CD one can easily listen to and enjoy.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are so amazing and its one app and millions of games! its even free!I appsulutly love this app!
B002VPE1AW|4.0|This is a well-scripted and incredibly well-made film (it is James Cameron, after all) set in a futuristic world but bringing up several historical and modern, Earthly social delemas.  The issue of uncontrolled consumerism has driven the people to the earth to depleat all of its natural resources and look for raw materials elsewhere, in this case finding them in a near-by star system; a galactic take on the often repeated terrestrial story of exploitation.  Encountering an indiginous people on the planet Pandora, the human characters in the film begin to exploit them and their native land to their own, industrial ends.  Not unlike the history of genocidal conquest of the New World by western powers in search of gold, precious stones and land; the film demonstrates a disregard for the spiritual connection the natives have to their homeland in the minds of the foreigners.  The Na'vi live in a spritual place where they are connected to nature, which helps win the day in the final battle, through a neural connection between minds and souls of living things; this can be thought of as an alagory to several ancient or indiginous religious practices (though with a more scientific explanation in the modern era), with harmony and balance between people and nature being a central aspect to the belief system.<br /><br />A well-made and thought out movie, Avatar is both the chance to see some stunning special effects produced by one of the true masters of that field and the oportunity to stimulate a little thought on the historical perspective of industrialism's expansionistic past and the effects that it has had on local populations and their belief structures.
0385535139|4.0|For years, John Grisham has been writing pulp fiction in a sweet spot -- attorney drama. He emulates the Hemingway Hero w/ his Most Brilliant Guy in the Room (MBGITR). Some of what he's written has been cringe-worthy, but he does enough really well to keep me hooked on everything he writes in law fiction.  His latest -- The Litigators -- is pretty damn good. Grisham's evolved. His MBGITR doesn't stand away from the crowd so much. Do you need to suspend belief? Sure, but that's why you're here anyway, right? He succeeds in getting me to turn pages and think about his story when I'm away from the book. He's (finally) telling several sub-plots concurrently and well.  Complaint? Would've rather a summer release.  Tom Sakell l harborsights.com

B002EC3932|5.0|Historicity is without a doubt one of the most unique piano trio albums to come along in quite some time. Vijay Iyer Trio's expansive, worldly, and highly intellectual style is one that they can claim as their very own, and it is exemplified the best in the 10 tracks here. For a while, I was very curious about this music but I had a hard time understanding it on the level that would maximize my appreciation. The moral of the story here is that Historicity requires patience and a A LOT of listening to really comprehend its musical depths. However, careful listening is rewarded with an understanding of this group's telepathic musical connection.

0812992792|5.0|This is an important, brilliantly conceived, though not always pleasant to read novel. At its center is Pak Jun Do, who withstands all sorts of brutality in the absurdly surreal world of North Korea. He goes from being an orphan, to a kidnapper, to a radio man on a fishing ship to a prisoner, and then finally assumes the identity of a national hero/tae kwondo champion who belongs to Kim Jung Il's inner circle and is the husband of the country's greatest national actress. The tales of how human life is so grotesquely devalued - from kidnapping innocent victims off Japanese soil to performing lobotomies on prisoners with nails over their eyeballs - make for difficult reading. But it remains a triumphant story about how this one character attempts to persevere, while everything he could hold precious, including his own identity, is stolen from him. The descriptions of the places he brings his mind to escape the physical torture or the things he must do to avoid starvation in prison camps, like eating moths, are delivered with brilliant prose. I read an interview with Adam Johnson in which he mentioned an upcoming memoir from someone who lived in a Korean gulag that details brutalities far in excess of any of those here. He also said he had to hold back and not match some of the more outlandish things Kim Jung Il actually did because it would have strained readers' credulity. It is hard to believe that a far more sadistic world than the one Orwell describes in 1984 actually exists somewhere, but this novel, in a magnificently literary way, offers a glimpse into just how cruelly distorted the world of North Korea is.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|UNO has been a favourite of mine since the early '80's. It's great to be able to play it against 3 (cpu) people, or against 1 (cpu) player whenever the mood strikes.<br /><br />It's a card game, so don't expect mind-blowing graphics. The graphics are perfectly sufficient, the sound effects are pretty cool, and you can customize gameplay by selecting the house rules that you want to follow (or not follow).<br /><br />All in all, this is the best card / board game that I've found for the Android platform. I have it installed on both my KINDLE FIRE and SAMSUNG GALAXY S2 (Epic 4G Touch - Sprint) and the app runs perfectly well on both devices. Highly Recommended!!! +++++++++

B004O3YGMC|3.0|I like this apps. It gives you the ability to remote control your home computer from everywhere if you have internet connection. You have to install a client software in your computer to make it communicate with your phone. Only complain is if your uninstall your Amazon app, then you will get a warning each time you start the app on your phone. I am not sure how long can you use it without the Amazon app installed. That is why it only get 3 stars. Without this concern, it will be a 4+.
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|Funny movie with a great plot idea, but some of the humor is lost in the foul language. I don't mind that particular word every now and then, but I think it is used too much and becomes a distraction.
006190385X|5.0|I found this book--years later since it was first published in 2005--and decided to read it since U2 have always been my favorite band.  I have laughed and cried to the point of tears, and have learned so much about a bunch of kids who started what they viewed as a mini-band in the 70's.  In 2011, they had the highest grossing tour.  Their music is ageless, and their story is ageless.<br /><br />It's one book that leaves out the debauchery of drug abuse and running through women like water, and instead focuses on how this band set out to make better music.  The have always been striving to be better musicians and performers.  There is a difference between the two.<br /><br />Absolutely read this book if you're a fan, or just a fan of music.  They speak of their travels in the US, places I've never even been before, and I've lived my whole life in the States.  Edge, Bono, Larry, Adam, and Paul--I love you guys!  I would love to be sitting on a porch swing in my twilight listening to your music and knowing you're still out there entertaining people.
B004B8RXQQ|1.0|Sherlock: The Great Game, 2011 film  The story begins in Minsk, Belarus. Holmes talks to a prisoner in a jail (who speaks English). There is a joke about hanging, and Holmes leaves. [Why is he in Minsk?] Holmes has the right to keep and bear arms in England. Watson finds something in the refrigerator. There is a noise from outside. Watson sees the news on TV. Mycroft visits Sherlock to look into a death of a civil servant who worked in the Defense Department. Lestrade calls Sherlock about a letter. A warning? A photo of a room in an E-mail message. There is a phone call from a woman in a car. Sherlock analyzes the behavior of a young man for a young woman. Watson inspects a pair of shoes. Sherlock adds to it, then remembers and old case where the shoes were missing. Another strange phone call to Sherlock. He goes to look at a rented car. What is in the manager's wallet? Another disappearance solved! The wife was in on it.  Another emergency call. There is a new dead body of a TV hostess that needs inspection. What are they dealing with? Sherlock solves the murder, it was done with a botox injection! Another telephone call to Sherlock, then they find another body by the Thames. Sherlock deduces information from a dead man. Sherlock visits an art gallery, he has sources of information. A giant man attacks Sherlock and Watson. [No gunshots?] Sherlock figured out why that picture was a fake: a detail in the sky. Next its to solve the death of that civil servant. We see how the body was planted. The missing memory stick was recovered. There is a meeting by a swimming pool. Jim shows up to tell about his skills. He boasts about burning Sherlock, putting one over. [Isn't this unbelievable?] There is a last scene that avoids an ending. [This is like some cartoon.]  Those who copy the Sherlock Holmes stories don't seem to have the skills to create their own original stories. This is a cartoon parody of the original that is inferior. The original stories had a background thattold about life from a century ago. This story jumps around too much with too many different plots. In the beginning Sherlock diagnoses the dress of a young man and forms a conclusion as to his character. This is proven wrong in the ending, its part of the parody. The National Health Service would have provided a salaried job for a young doctor. Watson would not have needed a roommate to share the costs of a flat, unlike a young doctor in the 1890s. Setting these stories in modern times produces mistakes.

B004SH40BQ|5.0|I bought this to go along with my 6th gen iPod nano that is mounted on a watchband.  I wanted this to use at the gym,so the headphone cord wouldn't be catching on stuff all the time.  It works just fine, no issues connecting or transmitting, and allows me to control the music from my headset.  The one minor issue is that it has no way to retain the paired status, so each time I use it, I have to put my headset into pairing mode to connect, but that is minor.  Perfect for what I bought it for, and great for what I paid, to get the heavy phone/player out of my pocket.

B005LAIIS0|3.0|I love movies like this.  Unfortunately, this new movie had major issues even my city wife noticed right off.  First off, let me say this is a solid movie, but came up short of being one of the greatest of its genre, due to the shortcomings of its storyline and survival techniques.  First off, the crash of the plane: I had to suspend disbelief that so many could crash in a plane and come away almost, if not totally, unscathed. Liam Neeson's character wakes up all by himself in the snow, like a car had thrown him out on pillowy snow, not an airplane in brutal conditions. Yeah, right!  Secondly: I had to again suspend disbelief that a group of timber wolves all the sudden hunt humans. At least the director/writer tried to explain this, but it was weak. (BTW, the CGI wolves were the best part of this movie!)So, again, as a moviegoer I have to say, OK, I'll let that go for the sake of entertainment.  Thirdly: Why would manly men leave the plane crash? They had everything there! Food, shelter, warmth, and the very place that rescuers would be looking. And not one man created or fashioned weapons out of all the debris, even though a pack of huge wolves almost instantly attacked them! Stupid.  Fourth: Now Liam Neeson's character plays the hunter that protects the oil men, killing and shootings wild wolves, right? And since he is supposed to know about hunting, animals behavior, etc, then why does he take the survivors right to the very den of the wolves he told the men he was helping was the very bloody reason these wolves were acting the way they were?!  Fifth: Now, why on earth did no character bother to fashion spears and walking sticks from the numerous trees that always surrounded them? Here they are, trudging wearily through snow drifts and snow storms, and not a one of them thinks primal! Not one of them thinks to trim some branches and make some makeshift weapons/walking sticks to help them defend themselves and just to walk. Been doing that since caveman days, butmodern man in this movie never even thought of it. Stupid!!!!!!  Sure, in one scene Liam's character shows the others how to make a sort of shock stick out of branches and shells. OK, on the right track here. Problem is, they use them once and you never even see any of the characters use makeshift spears ever again, despite leg wounds and exhaustion. C'mon, do these directors and screen writers think the audience is that stupid? I guess so, their marketing sucked me in.  And lastly is the ending. Total rip-off! Fade to black my ass! Just like the ending of The Sopranos. Rip-off.  The movie had so much going for it, too. Haunting. Good idea. Interesting characters and plight. Almost totally wasted to to piss poor directing and writing in minute details that even my NY city wife could see that was so stupid and wrong with this film.  I'm just glad the wolves won.
0345404475|3.0|Every so often I come across a book that is well known, well respected, so much so that when I read it I can't help but ask \\"What's all the fuss?\\" Sadly this is one of those books. I started reading it not caring too much that it was the source material for Blade Runner, I haven't seen that movie in over 25 years, but because it is often referred to as a Sci-Fi classic. Based on what I read, I don't know why, or how Philip K Dick came to be such a respected Sci-Fi writer. I didn't hate it, but I wasn't a classic either.  As many other reviews have noted, the author isn't much for heavy dialogue, descriptive action, or depth in his characters. I'm not familiar with any of the author's other works, so I don't know if this is his style, or if he was purposefully being vague in this book as sort of a tool to demonstrate the cold, impersonal nature of the world it is set in. Whatever his strategy, it didn't wow me. There are many moments that had the potential for frenzied action, tension building, or sense of satisfaction as you work through challenges with the protagonist Rick Deckard; but that potential was almost always wasted. Rick is as flat and nondescript as the androids he's hunting. You know he isn't in love with his job, but there isn't any back story to explain why he does it, or why his wife hates it (or much about his wife other than she's there and is a little weird about her moods), or even a general description of his appearance. None of the characters receive any real description accept for Rachael Rosen, who ironically sounds mannishly unattractive but is somehow an object of desire.  On the plus side something kept me reading all the way through. I've been known to drop a book I just hate (I'm looking at you Oscar Wao), but I at least wanted to know how the narrative resolved its self. Maybe I kept hoping I was missing something and the story would suddenly get deeper. The idea of semi-sentient androids trying to find freedom and meaning, even if it means murder is an interesting concept. I also thought the author's ideas about empathy being a distinguishing characteristic between humans and their creations was compelling, although I thought he could have gone to a deeper philosophical well with that. His androids are somewhat erratic, as well as demonstrating sociopathic behavior, but this is to be expected from something that thinks in purely logical modes. They are intelligent, but lack the experience, capacity and life span to put any of it to use beyond the desires of their creators. It at least makes the reader think a little. It isn't completely engrossing due to one blinding flaw: Humans would want machines that look and behave like them, but would want a way to ID them and shut them down as a safety precaution. If androids started murdering people and then escaping by blending into society, the consumers would demand \\"no-kill\\" programming, remote shut off, and easy means of identification.  Pros:  1.) The author's ideas about empathy are thought provoking. His uses of animals as something to give people something to feel a connection too after the Terminus War is also interesting; but I though he could have expanded on that.  2.) The androids are actually well thought out. They behave the way something would if they had little ability to emote beyond the simplest survival reflexes; they would kill or maim when necessary without remorse because it is merely a means to an end.  3.) The book is an easy read that won't consume too much of your time or brain power.  Cons:  1.) I read A LOT. Philip K Dick has some pretty tough competition in the form of the slew of fantasy, sci-fi and literary fiction authors I enjoy; but I find his powers of writing, at least in this case, somewhat wanting. If a book is going to be a \\"classic\\" I want depth, griping action and characters I want to know more about. There is little of that here.  2.) The whole Mercer thing went over my head. I understand the details of what theauthor described, but the details seemed too slapdash, so much so that the sort of big moments at the end didn't grip me at all. He should have stuck to the animals and expended on that concept.  3.) The very basic concept behind the plot of the book is unbelievably flawed. Humans may do some dumb things, but the first time an android killed someone or tried to pass themselves off as a human, that would be the end of that. As consumers, people flip out about silly little things, now imagine the backlash if something people paid over started killing people and ran off. Remember the firestorm over Toyotas that accelerated out of control? This would be that times a thousand. Sorry, not buying it.  Conclusion:  I can say I read this book and at least check that off my literary bucket list. It was OK, not great, and personally don't think a classic. It probably has an audience somewhere, but it isn't me.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game it is really entertaining when you are bored. this game has lots pf different games and I think you will really like it.
B005KELQEU|4.0|The sleeve case was just a little snug (causing the necessity of really having to squeeze the Kindle Touch inside the zipper).  Otherwise, I am pleased to have it to protect my Kindle.  It offers great protection.
B004LWZWC4|3.0|There has been a lot of buzz in the birding world when this movie was coming out. Almost every bird watcher that I know was anticipating its arrival. Our local Audubon chapter even brought out the author of the book to do a book signing and answer questions about this story. But was the hype really all it set out to be?  There are a few things this movie does a good job at - It entices people to go out and watch birds and shows just how challenging it can be and somewhat how fun. It does a good job at showing the different types of bird watchers (Laxed like Jack Black vs the very serious Owen Wilson), and it does an OK job at show casing the wide range of biodiversity (By geographic range only). But here's where it starts to get poor. The movie does not represent the book very well at all, it implicates a rather odd view of the pelagic trip leader, a person whom I've communicated with in real life Debrah Shearwater, it doesn't actually focus on the birds as much as the birding, it shows the extremes of bird watching and doesn't focus on the joys, and this movie can give birders a bad name (Now in state bird watching lists, we nickname certain birders Kamito based on their birding stratagies).  The book was very good and detailed, it covered the species being seen and chased ver well. The movie left a lot of the guts of this out. It added stuff that doesn't exist, and pretty much turned it into a hollywood movie, and not a true story like it truly is. While this is true for most books vs movies, I feel this hurt what could've been a better story in the long run, versus what it ended up being in reality. The casting was done very well, and Owen Wilson, Jack Black, and Steve Martin represent these three stereotypes based on their original characters, very well. So for that the movie is strong, but from the standpoint of a bird watcher with a dedicated life list for the US by ABA standards (Currently 445 species not a great accomplishment, but not bad after 3 years), and a world list by their own standards (687 currently), I was upset with the lack of details found by this movie.  If you go into it expecting to see a detailed report on Sandy Kamito's Big Year, you'll be slightly dissappointed. If you're doing this to see what kind of lives bird chasers live, you'll probably be more misled than educated. However, if you go into this with the mindset that I'm watching a movie that was written for  Hollywood and not for the story that sparked the book which led to the movie, you'll probably be happy with your purchase / rental and enjoy it. But please, don't take the movie to be a very serious representation for what really happened, and how birders really are. A Big Year is a very VERY tiny group of birders in the world. Not many people attempt it because it literally does take every ounce of your time and force you to spend a year traveling. This can be one of the most rewarding experiences in your life (Like for Jack Blacks character), or it can be the downfall of your existing life (Like Sandy Kamito - watch the movie to understand - no spoilers here).  I highly reccommend that if you read this, and what to know more about a real life Big Year experience, and the dedication, time, and money it takes to make this happen, hop over to google and search \\"John Vanderpoel Big Year 2011\\". John completed a big year this past December 31st missing the big year record by I believe 5 species (It's up in the air thanks to ambiguity in the ABA Guidelines for record acceptance - ask in the comments and I'll gladly explain). He of course won this last years record, and thanks to the remarkable migration flaws that occured, his number will more than likely be untouchable for the years to come, just as Kamitos still proves to be today.  In closure - this movie is just a glimpse at the 3 lives of 3 birders who have the same goal of copmeting in a big year. The movie will make you miss the days of traveling to Attu Alaska (no longer accessible to the public), provoke thoughts of traveling, but unfortunately it will do nothing to encourage the conservation of species, the protection of the birds habitats, or the pursuit for a species rights to continued existence. Maybe I expected too much, but as a birder, biologist, and wildlife conservationist, I was upset with the potential this movie had to make a difference.
0718157834|5.0|Generally my reading tends to be towards light romantic comedies.  This is not that.  It is well written with a thought provocing storyline.  It is deceptively simple at heart and I don't want to give away the storyline because it is interesting to read this book with no idea what to expect.  Because it very quickly picks up speed and becomes a very thought provoking story.  What you can expect is one of the best books I have read over the past twelve months.  Do yourself a favour and give it a chance you will not regret it.

145162445X|1.0|What a colossal bore this book would be if it didn't have a few interesting facts about the current state of quantum theory.  Unfortunately, the book's correct subtitle should have been not \\"Why There is Something Rather than Nothing\\" but only \\"How It Is That There Happens to Be This Something rather than Some Other Something.\\"  Admittedly that isn't quite the throat-grabber a publisher likes on a dust-jacket.  But--and why one has to point this out again and again and again to persons of a naturalist bent I cannot imagine--the transition from one physical state, describable by mathematical laws and comprising quantum functions, to another physical state is NOT the transition from nothing into a universe.  It leaves entirely untouched the venerable philosophical question of why there is something rather than nothing, and so the book is just one huge philosophical non sequitur.  I propose that henceforth that it should be legally required of any physicist who wants to write on ontological issues that he or she must first complete at least a Master's program in the history of philosophy and a Doctoral program in philosophical ontology.
B000063DFN|5.0|This was the first Maiden album I ever owned. I got it on tape in 1984, and to this day I am still in awe everytime I it listen to it. From the artwork, to the melodies, to the lyrics and subject matter, this album is absolutely perfect in my opinion.

B003VANOFY|1.0|MY HISTORY WITH THIS PRODUCT:  I've owned this headset for almost a full year. Technically, I've had two of them, since the boom mic snapped off the first one and had it replaced. I use these every day, for multiple hours and a variety of uses (VoIP calls, gaming, music, and movies).  PROS:  The audio quality, when it is working, is good. The bass in 7.1 mode is great, and the overall surround sound is pretty convincing. They are comfortable and rechargeable via USB.  CONS:  The biggest problem here is the wireless connection. Both headsets I owned suffered from this same problem - they would frequently just restart or lose the signal and reconnect. The process takes about 3-5 seconds each time, and sometimes you get multiple restarts in a row. It doesn't sound too bad until it happens when you're watching a movie and you have to quickly pause or rewind a bit because you suddenly couldn't hear anything they were saying (which also completely pulls you out of the movie), or when it drops out in the middle of a phone conversation, or drops out at the worst possible moment in a game... It happens probably two dozen times a day, if not more. At first, I didn't care too much about it, but the first time you have it drop out 3 times in a matter of a single minute, it's simply maddening. Imagine going randomly deaf for several seconds throughout every day of your life, and you'll get a sense of what it's like.  If I could simply plug the cable in and it would use the USB cable to transmit the audio instead of wireless, that would be perfect, but when it's plugged in, it simply charges the internal battery - you still get audio interruptions all the time. The interruptions will also reset the \\"mute\\" status on the mic, which can be troublesome if you're intentionally muted on a conference call and suddenly your mic is on and people hear you eating lunch.  Second problem is that the power button is a bit flaky. If the headset is plugged in via USB and powered off, sometimes it will not power on unless you unplug the headset and THEN power it on (and then you can plug it back in to continue charging). I thought it was a defect in my first headset until the same thing happened with the second one.  A minor third problem is that the boom mic is a little flimsy on the construction. I am careful with my toys, but it still cracked and finally snapped off one day when I was lowering the mic to use it, and that was only a few months into owning it.  OVERALL:  If they would fix the wireless, I would rate this 4 stars in a heartbeat. If they fixed the power button, it would go up to 5. That said, the G35 seems to be the G930 but wired, and cheaper. The number of times that I've wanted to really make good use of the wireless (go to another room and keep the audio going) is far less frequent than the dozens upon dozens of times that the audio cuts out, so it's just an unacceptable point for me, since that is what this headset is about.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|love it. played it over and over even if I had reached the highest rating! graphics were cool also. definitely a must have

014241543X|5.0|If you were faced with the choice and you had to choose, would you stay or go? If I Stay by Gayle Forman is an excellent book.  Her way of capturing the characters' emotions is impeccable. I highly recommend this book.  Once you pick it up you won't be able to put it down.   In this story, the main character Mia and her family get in a tragic car accident. At first Mia thinks she is okay, but then she realizes her body is lying on the snow covered ground. The rest of her family died and she is in critical condition. She can't figure out what happened to her. Mia is able to see everything that is happening around her, however she isn't dead. Throughout the book the reader experiences many flashbacks about Mia's life and are able to capture how she really felt.   I have only good things to say about If I Stay. The one thing I liked the most about this book was that instead of focusing on the accident all the time, it also talked about the good things in Mia's life through flashbacks. Now sometimes I think flashbacks get kind of confusing, but the way they were used in If I Stay were brilliant. I also liked the emotions that were present; they really touched my heart. This book also keeps you in suspense. I just had to keep reading to find out if Mia would choose to stay or go.   The characters really bring this book to life. They give it a sense of realism. Next to Mia, I think that Gramps, Mia's grandfather, was one of my favorite characters. He was quiet but somehow always knew the right thing to say at the right time. He said, \\"Do you think she really decides,\\" referring to Mia having the choice to live or die. It changed the whole tone of the book because Mia finally realized it was her choice.   I believe teens will enjoy If I Stay because they can relate to the characters and feelings they have. Us as teens have choices and decisions to make every day. It may not be as extreme as deciding to live or go, but in this book Mia also has to make choices about love. I'm pretty sure most teens can relate to relationships and the ups and downs that come along with them. Teens should read this book because it can help them with problems they may face, and after you start reading you'll realize the importance of life and learn to appreciate everything you have.   If I Stay is captivating and remarkable. It can bring tears to your eyes and yet make you smile at the same time. Let me ask you this; do you know what you would choose if you had to decide between life and death?

0812415086|5.0|What strikes me most about the content of Anne Frank's diary is that in spite of her restricted living conditions, the thoughts and feelings she shares, those of a teenaged girl going through the mental and physical changes of puberty, are  a lot like those you'd expect of an ordinary girl. She writes about her somewhat strained relationship with her mother, Mrs. Van Daan (actually van Pels) and Mr. Dussel (who she gives a teasing sort of pseudonym, Fritz Pfeffer); her initial dislike for but eventual crush on annexmate, Peter Van Daan; and what she is reading and/or studying during the two years covered. Situation-specific topics include: the progress of the war, food, and events and interactions (with those on the outside who help them) related to their attempts to remain hidden.<br /><br />The first entry is dated June 12, 1942, her 13th birthday, on which she receives the diary that she calls  \\"Kitty.\\" She confides (p 2), \\"I want to write, but more than that, I want to bring out all kinds of things that lie buried deep within my heart,\\" and states that she starts it because she \\"has no such real friend.\\" Not yet in hiding, she lives with her parents and 16-year-old sister, Margot, and shares that they \\"emigrated to Holland in 1933.\\" She attends a Jewish school. Less than a month later, she writes (p 12), \\"Daddy began to talk to us of going into hiding,\\" and on July 5, 1942, wearing many layers of clothing, the family begins their life in the \\"Secret Annex,\\" part of the same building in which her father once worked. Eventually, eight persons inhabit the annex: the Franks, Mr. and Mrs. Van Daan, their 15-year-old son Peter, and the dentist, Mr. Dussel.<br /><br />What amazes me most about her writing is its eloquence and insightfulness. She reveals her feelings of inadequacy (p 46), \\"I frequently feel weak, and dissatisfied with myself; my shortcomings are too great. I know this, and every day I try to improve myself, again and again...in the end, I always come back to my diary. That is where I start and finish, because Kitty is always patient.\\" In spite of the circumstances, she keeps her chin up, writing (p 170), `And in the evening, when I lie in bed and end my prayers with the words, \\"I thank you, God, for all that is good and dear and beautiful,\\"' is hopeful (p 264), \\"I can feel the sufferings of millions and yet, if I look up into the heavens, I think that it will all come right that this cruelty too will end, and that peace and tranquility will return again,\\" yet realistic (p 64), \\"I could go on and on for hours about all the suffering the war has brought, but then I would only make myself more dejected. There is nothing we can do but wait as calmly as we can till the misery comes to an end. Jews and Christians wait, the whole earth waits, and there are many who wait for death.\\" I highly recommend this excellent, eloquently-written diary (also good in audioformat). Also great: Survival in Auschwitz by Primo Levy, Time's Arrow by Martin Amis and The Book Thief by Markus Zusak.ck to my diary.

B003G4W49C|5.0|To start, im really glad theres a sequel. The end left me wanting more. One thing I thing that was a change from some books i have read is the reality of Ender. Hes believable, and doesnt have unrealistic (fake) feelings and emotions. The story was fast paced and exciting. I started a bit skeptical, thinking &#34;oh its another sci fi book.&#34; At the end, i was a changed kid. if you need something to read, thisis a great book.

B001UV4XJ2|4.0|I will admit that I cried while watching this. I have been a Harry Potter fan for years and seeing the final moments played out was wonderful. I do wish the directors would not have varied the ending from the book. For the fans of the books and movies, this is one thing that just about ruins the movie. It is still a great movie overall.

B004G5ZXVQ|4.0|Well it's only taken them two decades but REM have finally delivered what sounds like the logical follow up to 'Out Of Time' and 'Automatic For The People'. I always felt the lush textures of 'Out Of Time' and the personal introspection of 'Automatic...' were a perfect direction for the band to follow as they matured. In typical REM fashion they went their own way, but it's pleasing to see that after all the experimentation with noisy guitars, drum machines, keyboard loops and electronics, that they've finally returned to their signature sound.  Long-time REM fans, especially those who jumped on board with 'Green', will find plenty to love on 'Collapse Into Now'. The musical style is very much 'Out Of Time' crossed with 'Automatic...' with an added dash of 'Green' and 'New Adventures....', resulting in very much a \\"classic\\" sounding REM album. You know the deal: lots of jangling Rickenbackers, acoustic guitar, mandolin, and subtle keyboard and string touches, with a few rawer punchy rockers thrown in for good measure. As other reviewers have noted, this does mean that some songs here sound VERY similar to well-known tracks from earlier albums (e.g. 'Blue', 'Uberlin'), which may annoy some harsher judges but is not a big deal really. The key thing is that the album sounds really good, which more than makes up for a few familiar-sounding riffs.  What's most pleasing about 'Collapse Into Now' is its consistency. They don't have a standout hit single like 'Everybody Hurts' here, but they don't have a weak track either. You can pick any song: the statement-of-purpose opener 'Discoverer', the driving 'Mine Smell Like Honey', ballads like 'Uberlin', 'It Happenned Today' or 'Oh My Heart', or the eerie closer 'Blue'. Nothing sounds forced, out-of-place, or poorly executed, resulting in their most coherent musical and lyrical statement since 'New Adventures...'.  Above all, REM sound like they're relaxed and having fun again. The bands' post-'Automatic...' output often felt to me a bit forced and self-conscious, as if they were trying too hard to capture a specific \\"sound\\". 'Collapse Into Now' in contrast feels effortless; the band are back in their element and it shows.  So sure, you can criticise 'Uberlin' for sounding like 'Drive', or 'Blue' for sounding like 'E-Bow The Letter', or the one with the mandolin sounding the other ones with the mandolins. But you're kind of missing the point. REM finally want to sound like REM again, and on 'Collapse Into Now' they produce a classic album that serves as both a perfect end to their career, as well as a strong album on its own terms.  Four stars.

B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Bought this as a memory upgrade for my HP 1525 Color laser printer as per recommendations of previous reviews of this product. If you go by the HP manual it tells you how to uninstall the included memory, you don't do that but rather follow the instructions to install in the available slot in front of the installed memory. It took two tries to get the memory seated right, but when it was it booted up without problems to the \\"ready\\" state on the panel. I am running Windows 7 so followed the instructions to enable the memory in the user manual. This is where I hit a snag because there wasn't an automatic configuration prompt visible. There is a drop down menu where you can select total memory, but the highest option available is 256, and the total memory installed was 384. Ignoring this step I tried to troubleshoot by printing a configuration page, and the memory was listed as 384. I am telling this story for other non techies such as myself so if you run into the problems I did, print a configuration page to confirm your upgrade. HP tells you to do this in the manual, but only after you've enabled the memory. Only time will tell if the upgrade improves performance, but for $10 it's definitely worth it!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|This is one of the most interesting movies that I have seen in the last decade. Very refreshing to watch a movie that  does not rely on a formula (good v. evil; love triangle; power struggles, etc) but attempts (successfully) to give the viewer a sense of what life is really like for both a struggling musician and a recent immigrant, and how the two help each other through tough times.

0307959856|4.0|P.D. James recreates the world of Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet and adds a murder to spice things up.  It is an enjoyable read but is not on a level with Pride and Prejudice.  The sparkling dialogue and interactions are missing.  So it's fun but not profound.

B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|This could have been such a good movie, but watching Brad Pitt try to act kept drawing me out of this movie.
B005UT29Z0|1.0|How could the word \\"thriller\\" appear in the description of this movie??? This was one of the worst movies I've seen in the past 12 months.  It was so slow and tedious. And just when the movie could have started to get good, it just ends.  What a waste of some incredibly acting talent!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|No spoilers to follow:  If there is one thing I hate in entertainment, it is the Hollywood formula.. you know, boy meets girl, trouble ensues, happily ever after. I want to be surprised, thrilled, dropped, and lifted up again in ways that I never see coming while at the same time having a resolution that makes me feel like it's been time well spent. The entire series took me on this journey. I could never have predicted the way it would go and while I had my own ideas about where I might take the story if I were writing it, I couldn't have written a better ending for my entertainment personality had I written it myself.  Take this illustration: you wouldn't want a friend to suddenly start listening to a band you like or wear brand you like simply because they are trying to be what they think you want them to be. Suzanne Collins doesn't cater to the Hollywood formula by being what she thinks we want her to be just so we will like her. No, she takes the reader to a place where they are forced to learn something about themselves. As Mockingjay concludes, there is some very poignant writing mixed with plot that describe deep human emotion in such a powerful way that one cannot understand unless he or she has felt them personally. That would be the difference between the lover of the Mockingjay and the detractor.

0062082353|1.0|This book was a disappointment.  Not only is the book poorly organized, but it is also poorly written.  Generally, a reader in this genre is interested in understanding who SEALs are, what motivates them, how do they able to overcome extreme hardship and stress (physical and mental), how SEALs are trained, how are SEALs utilized in modern warfare, what first-hand insights can the author offer on the conflict, etc.  This book skips all over the place with no real organization.  There is also a lot of random information, seemingly irrelevant to the story, haphazardly scattered throughout the book.  There is very little detail provided on the training or missions, and the author seemingly takes a tone that the reader is somehow unworthy of such information.  I got the sense that the author was approached and influenced by some business-minded publishers/co-authors looking to cash in on the recent media interest surrounding the SEALs, and as a result, the book was hastily written and published.  The thing that was most troublesome was the author's view on his enemy, which has the effect of significantly undercutting the author's achievements.  The author makes broad generalizations about the Iraqi people, including by calling all insurgents \\"savages\\" and \\"terrorists.\\"  The author essentially likens his actions in Iraq to shooting fish in a barrel.  He tells a story about how his first kill was a woman who emerged from her home to lob a grenade at some Marines.  He dismisses her as a \\"savage,\\" but fails to consider her motivations and reactions to a foreign force invading her country and her town.  I understand that it was not the author's job to process those thoughts at the time, but I certainly would not go so far as to summarily dismiss the enemy and their tactics after the fact considering how far superior the coalition force was and the fact that it invaded those peoples' homes.  I would not think that most people would consider someone a terrorist just because they attempted to bring harm, by whatever means available, to a foreign invader.  It was also hard to overlook how egotistical and sociopathic the author comes across as.  It's obvious in the book, and unfortunate, that the author uses \\"patriotism\\" as a veil to disguise his true, seemingly insatiable, desire to play real life \\"cowboys and indians\\" out in the desert.  He repeatedly reminds the reader of how much of a \\"bad ass\\" he is by regaling the reader with several bar fight stories and hazing pranks that went too far.  He boasts how easy it was for him to kill, all the while touting that he is a good Christian.  The whole book just makes me feel ashamed as an American and seems to fly in the face of SEAL credo.
B0000256KE|3.0|Roxy Music's second album \\"For Your Pleasure\\" has by many been appointed to the group's best and most important. And, yes, there are several fine songs to be found on the album. \\"Do the Strand\\" is real early Roxy Music style - very ala \\"Virginia Plain\\" - a great piano-driven rocker.<br /><br />\\"Beauty Queen\\" is a fine melodic ballad - perhaps the album's most enduring song.<br /><br />\\"Grey Lagoons\\" also belongs among the best numbers on the album.<br /><br />The title track could have been the highlight of the album, but the great melody and the fine guitar theme gradually disappears into oblivion as the track evolves into an instrumental marathon where the original melody gradually is abandoned - too bad.<br /><br />\\"Editions of You\\" is an accomplished rocker.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are for my taste either too sketchy or prolonged or downright boring.<br /><br />Not a bad album, but in my opinion far from their best. The three subsequent albums \\"Stranded,\\" \\"Country Life\\" and \\"Siren\\" are along with \\"Avalon\\" far more well-rounded albums. Personally I have always thought that \\"Siren\\" is somewhat underestimated.

B004GUSG4M|5.0|In a word? Chilling. This book was a taught, suspenseful journey through the mind of Christine Lucas, a woman who starts every day with a clean mental slate. Unable to remember much of her past or create new memories that last more than a day, Christine struggles to put together the pieces of her life.<br /><br />I really empathized with Christine's character. Her whole ordeal just horrified me, all around. I can't imagine waking up to the world that she lives in every day. Her strength and resilience impressed me and made me root for a positive resolution for her.<br /><br />I thought this was a great read all around. It was different, which I enjoyed. The subject matter and plot were compelling. The pacing was perfect - I finished each chapter desperate to get to the next one, and as I read on I felt a building sense of dread for Christine.<br /><br />This one is definitely a page-turner, so don't pick it up until you have a chunk of time to devote to it!

B005OK81HA|5.0|Is it possible to fall in love all over again with the same ol' songs that are played all the time at show after show and we hear time and time again on classic radio?  That's a resounding HELL YEAH!!  First, let me say it was nice to hear Klaus Meine sing the entirety of the songs. Usually in a LIVE show, he has the audience help quite a bit. This is okay, because that's what the fans love to do and what Klaus loves to hear. But, it was refreshing hearing his voice throughout the whole CD.  Second, let me say, the man with the bionic voice has never sounded better. He is in rare form and I love hearing these classics in his current voice, which barely sounds any different than his golden years. It's a superb feeling, hearing that incredible signature primal snarl once again on the rockers and then to turn around and hear that soft velvet voice, such as on Still Loving You, almost like he's whispering in your ear. It's like silk on skin. Hey, remember guys, I am a woman and call it like I hear it.  One thing I did ask myself at one point while listening to No One Like You was; is it LIVE or is it Memorex? For those too young to remember the commercial; it was an ad about a Memorex cassette tape being played up against the real singer and they asked in the ad, \\"is it LIVE or is it Memorex?\\" Okay, well, that is what I asked at first. Some of the guitar parts, especially the solos, were so exact, that I really wondered for a minute if the original guitar parts had literally been dubbed into the current song or did these guys actually channel their early years and remained so true to the originals that I really couldn't tell. However, I can assure you with certainty, that these songs have been redone, no dubbing included. Just listen and you can hear the difference between the new songs and the classic songs; there's a maturity, a more polished and refined sound, if you will. I also love the heavier sound they put to them; Rhythm of Love for instance. That really rocks.I am, to say the least, very impressed and am excited as hell over this CD. I still can't get over how Klaus sounds, and how Matthias attacks the Lead and James adding a fresh beat to the mix. I love the dual guitars, as usual the seamless mix of Schenker's and Jabs' guitar playing that is so cultured after all these years, gives it such a fine balance. I also want to say that I don't believe for a minute that Matthias or Rudolf would stand for dubbing the old guitars onto their new CD. They are proud of their abilities and so therefore, I am convinced that they are redoing these songs. Additionally, even though James and Pawel weren't members at the time of these classics, I have to say they hold their own. For the seasoned diehard Scorps fan, they can hear the difference in James' style compared to Herman's. And yet, James has added his own character, along with Pawel's bottom bass to make them new sounding. And they sound gooood! And I will always love Rudolf's rhythm guitar and his leads of course. He's so accomplished.  The other half of the CD is covers. Who ever thought they would do several covers on their album? Yeah sure, they have done covers before, but not to this extent.  I love Tainted Love. The way Klaus and the boys made it their own without losing the originality of the song, was most inspiring. Most of the time, when a band records covers, they make it so much their own, they screw up the song. Not so with Scorps. They probably realized how many times THEIR songs were covered and screwed up, so didn't want to make the same mistake. The lead solo by Matthias using that tremolo is a fantastic composition. And James' drums are hard driving fantastic!  Children of the Revolution is one heavy riffed song and it's one to really get into. It's heavier than what Scorpions have done in quite some time. Even though it was a cover, I was glad to hear Klaus' ability to still sing with that much strength. James is slamming out that beat that is so his form. And do we even have to mention the guitars? LOVE that heavy metal sound. But, guess what you hear at the end; that unmistakable signature sound of Matthias Jabs. If you were to listen to the original by T. Rex, you would find that there is no comparison. Scorpions killed this one and put the original to shame! I would love to see them add this to their final 2012-13 tour!  The choice of Across the Universe was a surprise to me as I have so many others in mind from The Beatles they could have done. But that's not my call. Listen, I'm not really complaining it's just not one of my favorite Beatle songs. Klaus, as usual, does it justice though, with that caressing smoothness of his voice, making the song so very much his own.  Tin Soldier starts out sort of poppy, but then suddenly it gets very \\"Scorpionized\\". It's almost like THEY wrote and did this song already. I liked it because of that familiar feeling of Golden Days Scorps. Actually, I'm really liking this song a lot.  All Day and All of the Night is fun for me because it's one I have loved since way back when. And for my favorite band to redo it is a double treat. What I find consistent in these covers is that they don't change it up so drastically that it loses the original sound. And yet Scorps still make it their own by adding to the songs, such things as, Matthias' distinguished lead guitar sound that put him in the annals of one of the best guitar players in the 80's, and what gave Scorpions their unique sound, and the inimitable, distinct raucous voice of the one and only Klaus Meine are still there. Of course there is James giving his own flavor along with Rudolf and Pawel. Other than that, the songs remain the same.  I like how they begin Ruby Tuesday. I couldn't quite put my finger on the guitar intro and why it sounded so familiar until I went and replayed both The Best Is Yet to Come and The Good Die Young intros. Yep, there it was that feeling of the two sort of mixed together for the Ruby Tuesday intro. I agree with a friend of mine who said the boys do this far better than the great Rolling Stones.  Scorpions do this song such justice, Stones should be proud. Matthias does quick little licks that are so characteristic; it's such a pleasure to hear this little bit of Scorps in an infamous cover song.  I highly recommend this excellently done CD. It's a wonderful trip into a classical rock tour; from their originals to covers that they excelled at in their execution. By the way, I put this on my MP3 player because I love listening to these splendid works in my ear while making people wonder why I have such a silly grin on my face.  I want to end with this; I may have given Klaus and Matthias many kudos, but without the entire team, the stability of the Scorps machine with Klaus, Rudolf, Matthias, James, and Pawel, this would not have sounded as good. And even though there are new members that did not do these songs back in the day, it still turned out first-rate. So I say kudos to all of them.  Buy this now!!!

B004EPYZZ8|5.0|This is a great movie! 5/5 for sure!  The movie has good actors, there aren't awkward actors who you can tell have been on the set for the first time... The quality is good as well.  The movie covers topics of: Family stress, taking things for granted, and fear (especially fear.)  I can't put a direct line for what age group I think this would be good for... It depends on whether or not your kids can handle trauma. I'd say for someone to get what's going on and for the movie to really make sense I'd say 11+ -But if you have a mature kid, take 'em!  The shark attack scene shows a shark's head coming out of the water and yanking on Bethany's arm. (You do not see her arm come off.) If you don't like blood, you won't like this scene... There is quite a lot of it. However, you can for sure tell that this scene is about to happen, there is no \\"all the sudden a shark took her arm off.\\" There is a lot of tissue, blood, etc. hanging from her arm after the shark attack. (Take note, you may mistake some of it for the shirt that was tied around her shoulder.) -If you can handle blood, you can handle the scene. It just depends on your idea of \\"graphic.\\" To me, it was for sure not the worst I have scene.  There is no swearing, the music is all Christian based. The movie concentrates a lot on overcoming your fears (to me anyhow)  GREAT MOVIE!!! LOVE IT!!! :)
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This movie is beautifully filmed and really brings Paris to life. It makes you want to go visit. The historical \\"time travel\\" that Owen Wilson's character takes every night is like a revisiting old novels and history books about artists who made history. It is not a great love story, but Woody Allen's movies are most often about people becoming disconnected from each other and looking for a way to connect to themselves. His character Gil is no exception. He is a Hollywood screenwriter who is looking to write a novel and find inspiration in Paris. But, his fiance(Rachel McAdams)wants to marry Gil as successful screenwriter, not a struggling writer, and she ends up having a affair while Gil is off each night looking for love, inspiration or both. This movie is each to watch, lighthearted and fun. I bought for the great view of Paris.

1451627289|5.0|With a novel such as 11/22/63, I fail to understand why some novice book reviewers, such as myself, wish to reveal the entire plot in a book review? In my opinion, one of the many joys of reading Stephen King is discovering the unknown, and what wonderful tricks SK has up his sleeve this go around. 11/22/63 is one of my favorites novels, from my all time favorite author, in several years! SK never fails to deliver and always keeps the reader awake until the wee hours of night, unable to put down the book, devouring each chapter like a fine chocolate truffle! Unlike some of Mr. King's other mammoth novels, the reader will be constantly in suspense, and eager for what is next, but not terrified and checking under the bed before finally turning off the bedside light to go to sleep.  I am a Kindle owner and love downloading books immediately, but some books must be owned and held in the reader's hand. This is one of them! If you are a fan of suspense, conspiracy theories, time travel, and the \\"What Ifs\\" in life, you will adore this book! Happy Reading fellow Stephen King Fans... and for those who have never ventured into Stephen King's world.. this book would be an excellent place to start. Namaste`

0439023513|4.0|*No Spoilers*  Just finished Mockingjay. I am very impressed.  I read all three books with no interruption, feel the first of the trilogy is the strongest, but Mockingjay ends trilogy in a very powerful way.  Here are things I liked and didn't like in retrospect:  LIKED:  1) Katniss' choice between Gale and Peeta - The final choice in my opinion, was the best possible one.  2) Fate of Presidents of Coin and Snow - Considering what is revealed in this novel about each President's motives, I thought the outcome was very poetic and deserving on either side.  3) Graphic Content of novel - I generally don't feel gratuitous violence necessarily improves the telling of a story, but in this tale I felt the author was not afraid to let the senseless casualty of war become so overwhelmingly oppressive it forced me to stop trying to predict how her story was going to end, and just keep reading. Bold move.  4) It really wasn't a 'kid's' book (and certainly NOT a Twilight clone) - The harsh realities and ironies that occur throughout the story could bring out a reaction in anyone, young or old.  I think what I appreciate the most about finishing this trilogy is that discussions I might have afterwards would involve issues a lot deeper than romantic conclusions for Katniss, Gale, and Peeta. No one who reads these books can finish them without thinking about the actions that were taken on a deeper level. A very good thing.  DIDN'T LIKE:  1) Book three Katniss was almost as annoying as Bella Swan in Twilight - There were a lot of random closet hidings and impulsive decision making from Katniss in this part of the trilogy.  It was very irritating to read, and reminded me forcibly of Bella Swan in Twilight. The only saving grace is that in the end, it's hard for me to not to imagine Katniss devolving from a sure footed, smart, hunter type girl into a real emotional mess considering the horrific things she has had to deal with in so short a time. After going through not one but two hunger games in a row, only to see her most cherished relationships get even more hurt/damaged/put in jeopardy, perhaps the immaturity or selfish behavior is perfectly understandable. Still, it was very 'Bella Swan-ish' and I got very tired of Bella in Twilight. Thankfully (or sadly) things get so bad in this book, it replaces any irritation I had with Katniss for sympathy and concern, and sober reflection as to how I would have handled such horrors...  2) The sheer loss of life and characters - By the time the story was over, it was hard to imagine how the survivors of that human race could even continue to exist. Or maybe that was the point? I keep thinking perhaps the author wanted so many characters I grew to care about to die so her final thematic message would hit home all the more... no world that believes in sacrificing their own children to preserve some false sense of peace deserves any chance to exist in the first place...  Anyway, I liked the story overall and think it deserves to be read (and re-read.) The world is better for books like these that compel it's readers to think on a deeper level.  I was ready to dismiss this as just another fantasy outlet for Twilight or Harry Potter fans, but I am happy to say Hunger Games was much more substantial than that.
0307888681|5.0|Having read the \\"Zombie Survival Guide\\" I was definitely hooked on Max Brooks' writing style from the start, but that was nothing compared to how I feel about him now. World War Z is a refreshing collection of short stories about the Zombie Apocalypse AFTER it has already happened, loaded with so many interesting characters as they describe how they survived in various parts of the world. From hiding in Submarines, Ships, Mountains, Tunnels, the tactics used to survive are so real and believable. From the everyday person to the military, you really get a sense of how catastrophic this event was, and the psychiatric toll it had on the survivors (if you can call them that, at one point towards the end they believe the entire event has taken the life and soul from everyone who had to endure it, so did they really survive in the sense that life will be normal again?).<br /><br />Brooks also has a very clever writing style, bringing modern issues to the book that really seem fitting, or in some ways ironic, to how each culture dealt with the issue. The fact that Americans were swimming and boating to Cuba as refugees, or how the North Korean government locked it's borders and many years later still not a person was to be seen inside their walls.<br /><br />This is a great read if you're into Zombie stories, I came away from it wanting more. There isn't a lot out there about how people made it AFTER the apocalypse, which I find more interesting than the oncoming Zombies themselves. Life in post World War Z goes on, but it is definitely not the same. Look out for tall grass, beaches, and swimming holes!
B0055SWM08|5.0|The classic slide game with a few new components thrown in to keep it interesting. A good variety of puzzles is included. Well worth the money.
B000S0GYRU|2.0|One thing this film is well known for is the visuals and the score. Not so much for th plot. The acting and dubbing was, in my opinion, ok at best. Rent before buying. I myself found this movie to be rather boring and slow. I can see why it was classic over 30 years ago. The visuals and the score(which in my opinion tended to be a bit repetitive) are rather unique. What was eerie and scary 30 years ago may not be for many in this day and age. Some people seem to still like this film but I mostly found it boring.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use it on kindle fire works great,I also installed on wife's as well.would suggest to anyone to try it out.

B00526ZKYS|3.0|WARNING: SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!!!!!!!  Where do I began?  To me, this book was a crossover between Gone, Twilight, with a little bit of the Hunger Games.  The mushy romance was one part of this book that I found nausiating.  After the run, all she can think about is Alex, and I find that imfuriating.  Can't we have one female character who is able to live without their love intrests?  Is that too much to ask?  Then, after she starts hanging out at 37 Brooks, Hana is nonexistant.  She is 10 times more intresting than Lena, who is your run of the mill &#34;Oh, no one will ever think I'm pretty.  I'm just a girl who believes everyone until I meet a guy.&#34;  Gimme a break.  Alex's only description is &#34;Leaf-colored hair&#34; and that's all Lena thinks about.  Lena's mother is a character who I would love to hear more about, she sounds intriguing.  Maybe in Pandemonium?  Ok, the positives.  The plot and basic storyline are intresting enough, it's just not executed the way I would've preffered.  Lena is a pretty typical character, but she has those moments that really make her shine.  Grace isn't a main character, but I think that she would be if Lena had been paying attention to more in Augest besides just Alex.  Her not speaking and that special connection that her and Lena have I would have loved to see blossem and grow.  Alex is supposed to be this amazing tough guy, but I think he is just too normal.  he doesn't have that spark that will capture my intrest and make me fall in love with him, too.  Although, he does help Lena open her eyes and see what the cure does.  I will read the rest of the series because, let's face it, we all know that Alex isn't really dead.  I just hope that Lena will be able to know who she is without him.
B003DZX3US|5.0|I was a little worried about the quality of this movie after reading other reviews. They said the lines are messed up and the characters look funny. This is one of my favorite movies and I didn't notice anything wrong with the picture. It's a great edition and looks awesome on blu-ray
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it because the games don&rsquo;t cost real money that you unlock. Some of the games are boring. Besides it's a pretty fun game :)
B004I744AS|5.0|Outstanding app. Simple and clutter free interface. One of the best Kindle Fire app. I use it routinely to help my son with his home work.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This movie was incredibly tedious, not scary and the characters were totally uninteresting. You didn't care what happened to them because they showed no real human empathy for each other. Their actions in this pseudo-documentary made no sense unless you thought of them as really stupid, shallow people. Makes you wonder about the author of the screenplay. This movie was also over-hyped which only added to the disappointment.  One thing that struck me was that the authors of the story may have been trying to make a statement about the bizarre way some people live nowadays as they continually record and review their lives on some sort of device.  The irritating presence of the camera in this film may have been an attempt to show this modern technological preoccupation as a inherantly narcissistic process.  Maybe it was also showing how impotent we have all become as we endlessly record and vicariously review the everyday process of our lives without ever taking any real action until it is too late. Finally, the ending was so predictable and totally pointless. What a colossal waste of time!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that you can get so many different versions of the Bible to compare texts and phrases... very good app...

B006DRVFRQ|4.0|I have really enjoyed this app. I find that I can move through my blog posts faster on the app than the web version. My only complaint is that video feeds are not supported.
0743201140|3.0|This book is a sequel to First, Break All the Rules, and although it is intended as more of an individual growth book, many of the ideas are ones that leaders and managers can capitalize on in growing and developing their employees. The main idea throughout the book is how to build on your strengths and manage around your weaknesses. It also comes with a PIN code that you can use to find out what your top five strengths are. It's a bit of a tedious process, and I'm not sure about the basis for the final determination. If you want to learn more than your five top strengths, you've got to pay a hefty fee to do so. It feels a bit like a marketing hook, but the basic concept of focusing on strengths is sound.
145162445X|4.0|I keep banging up against sloppy editing, \\"Independent estimates of the clusters' total mass is possible...\\" and disjunctions that suggest wholesale cutting-down of the manuscript's length without any corresponding attempt to provide new transitions.  The discussion of the cosmic microwave background is one example: you really can't refer to \\"that 'last scattering surface'\\" if you haven't mentioned, much less defined, ANY \\"last scattering surface\\" previously. And in fact he never does bother to define it or explain why it's called that. (The diagram on page 45 seems oddly drawn, as well: why don't both legs of the triangle that represents our field of vision reach the last scattering surface?  Isn't the point that THAT is what we're looking at in the illustrations that follow?  Or am I missing something?  Since the whole discussion is about the geometry of the straight lines beams of light travel, this really isn't completely trivial.)  The odd shift in topic at the top of the fourth page of Chapter 5 is another bothersome example, with the author suddenly working \\"to put a lower limit on the age of these stars,\\" referring to stars which have not been mentioned anywhere in the preceding discussion.  I suppose Krauss is referring to Type 1a supernovas, but the disjunction is jarring and unnecessary.  Most of the anecdotes are meaningless morsels, and the overabundance of exclamation marks seems intended to instill an ingratiating, but false, sense of insider-ness.  I appreciate the often successful attempt to provide an introduction to a subject that is barely conceivable, much less comprehensible, but the execution is disturbingly ramshackle.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love this game it keeps you hooked for hours, and the rewards are funny and cool. my only problem is that the controls stock sometimes and the graphics are pretty subpar, but game play makes up for it.
B00632HWOG|5.0|A must have for your Kindle Fire.  It load fast, all my emails show up.  I haven't used to to reply yet, but I believe it will be ok.  It makes a beeping noise when I have a new email.  I think there is a setting somewhere to shut that off.

B003162R7E|4.0|Jimi Hendrix was by general agreement the most inventive, original and prolific musician/performer of his era, and carved out new territories for what could be done with an electric guitar. He composed and recorded more great material in five short years than do most musicians in a lifetime career ten times as long. He was imitated by thousands, but equalled by none.<br /><br />Following Jimi's untimely death in September 1970, a great volume of his hitherto unreleased material was put out first by Track Records, and later by Polydor. The first major posthumous release was `The Cry of Love' vinyl album (CD format didn't arrive on the market until the 1980s) released by Track Records in 1971 which contained, in running order:<br /><br />Side 1<br />1. Freedom<br />2. Drifting<br />3. Ezy Ryder<br />4. Night Bird Flying<br />5. My Friend<br /><br />Side 2<br />6. Straight Ahead<br />7. Astro man<br />8. Angel<br />9. In from the Storm<br />10. Belly Button Window<br /><br />`Cry of Love' can still be found on both the original vinyl and a later CD format, but good copies command high prices.<br /><br />`First Rays of the New Rising Sun', thought to be Hendrix's own chosen title for his planned 1971 album, contains all the above tracks, some digitally re-mastered (though it's hard to tell the difference) plus several bonus tracks originally released by Polydor in the mid-1970s variously on the albums `Rainbow Bridge,' `Experience' and `War Heroes':<br /><br />* Izabella<br />* Room Full of Mirrors<br />* Dolly Dagger<br />* Beginnings<br />* Stepping Stone<br />* Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)<br />* Earth Blues<br /><br />All these pieces with the exception of `My Friend' (a kind of late-night studio oddity from 1968 which didn't make the `Electric Ladyland' album) were composed and recorded in the spring and summer of 1970 and feature Brit-drummer Mitch Mitchell from the original `Experience' trio and Jimi's old army buddy Billy Cox on bass, who worked with Jimi in place of Noel Redding following the `Band of Gypsies' period and, it has to be said, was a more sensitive and just plain better musician than Redding. Overall it's pretty much the definitive collection of Hendrix's late-period material and a fine complement to his earlier finished products `Are You Experienced', `Axis Bold as Love' and the seminal 1968 epic `Electric Ladyland.'<br /><br />This late offering from the Sony `Legacy' collection claims to be \\"re-mastered\\" yet again, but it's hard to tell the difference and there is certainly no discernible improvement on the Polydor mix. As a \\"bonus\\" you get a 17-minute DVD, mostly of Eddie Kramer talking to camera between sound bites of Jimi playing. Basically, it's a waste of time and something of a gimmick, to make the Hendrix family \\"re-mastered re-release\\" of the re-mastered re-release of the re-release seem like something new and different. Please forgive the cynicism, but the music ain't better, it's the same. The music is 5-star and always will be, but somehow you just can't give full approval to a marketing gimmick like this which asks you to pay a lot extra for a short and  crummy DVD, so because of that, the rating drops a star.<br /><br />However, back to focus on the actual music: if you want to know why Jimi Hendrix is so highly revered by other rock musicians, listen to this collection and you will begin to understand. It's amazing to hear how fresh these recordings are: after 40 years they might have been recorded yesterday, they sound so contemporary; whilst so much music in the intervening period - especially from the 1980s - sounds old and dated. The musicianship here is exemplary, the compositions innovative, exciting and complex, the arrangements tight and disciplined, production values on the whole very high. What wonders Jimi might have produced as a more mature musician and composer we can only speculate: he was a true musician's musician, a one-off.<br /><br />BTW if you want to listen to `Cry of Love'as originally released in 1971, just mix the 10 tracks into the 1-10 order above and miss out the extra seven, crank up the volume and press `PLAY'. Isn't technology wonderful?gy wonderful?

B0025VLEM0|5.0|If you are looking for the perfect Zombie moie, look no farther than Shaun Of The Dead! Not only is very funny, but also has some great scares throughout. The movie doesn't take itself seriously from the get go and that is why it works so well! In the end you don't have just a comedy making fun of zombie movies or vice versa, but you have the perfect balance of both. Get this movie!
B006P0FICE|5.0|The story may be al ittle weak, but sometime you just need a great action movie with similiar styles to mission impossible.  I highly recommend this movie!  Stunts and action sequences are remarkable!
0439796644|4.0|The War Horse is written for children, but with more than a child's eye for detail.  The author gets into the head of the animal and gives a horse' eye view of World War I.  The story keeps your interest and it is easy to see why there is a Tony-winning stage play based on it and now a major motion picture as well.  I am no an avoid reader, but this story struck home and made me want to read it.  I am rereading the story at this time, more for enjoyment than content.  It is obviously an easy read, though terminologies flirt with more in-depth descriptions of action, mood and emotion.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|We loved the moved and was very pleased with our  purchase. I order from amazon often am always pleased  with the quality of my purchase.
0525478817|5.0|Wow. This book is amazing. Let me just say that.  It will make you laugh, make you cry, make you laugh/cry in nearly the same page. But it also makes you think and make you smile.  This book is touching in so many ways. To see such a great love story, and yet  also to be so sad.  And DAMMIT. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO HAZEL.  Just like she wanted to know about Anna and the Dutch Tulip Man.
0385738765|5.0|The Scorch Trials, the second book in the Maze Runner trilogy, was suspenseful, well-written, and greatly improved on the first book. Here are some reasons why I liked this book even better:  - More suspenseful and, in my opinion, a more enjoyable plot.  - The characters. I really did not like any of the characters that much in the first book, especially Thomas. But I have grown to like all of them in this book and I especially like the newer characters, such as Jorge, Brenda, Harriet, and Sonya.  - I thought this one was better written.  I highly recommend reading this book if you are a Hunger Games fan.
B000JJSPXQ|5.0|\\"Roxette Hits\\" is a great compilation of songs ranging from the creatively dramatic such as \\"Fading Like a Flower\\" and the highly upbeat in the form of \\"Joyride.\\" I enjoy this collection because many of the tunes are performed with intense emotion.  My overall favorite musical tune has to be \\"Listen To Your Heart.\\" The dance group DHT remade \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" with stunning results in 2005. However, it was Roxette who originally put \\"Listen To Your Heart\\" on the musical map with the effect of brilliance.  \\"Roxette Hits\\" is best for anyone that enjoys happy pop music from the 80's/90's era.
0307891372|5.0|You can play the game without it but there is so much more i would not have realized without the book. Tells you in depth detail about everything and then some you need to know about the game. Its a must buy to explore much more than just the basic mission game play. I give it two thumbs up!
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I purchased The Metalist: The Complete Third Season, and it was quite enjoyable. My family and I couldn't wait to watch one or two episodes a day. We anticipate the fourth season coming out on dvd so that we can purchase that one as well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|In the novel \\"The Dead Zone\\", King uses school teacher John Smith to explore the question of changing the future to stop a horrific event seen in vision.  In \\"11/22/63\\", King uses school teacher Jake Epping to explore changing the future by stopping a horrific past event -the assassination of John Kennedy. However, unlike Smith who is sure of his actions, Epping has no gift prescience to know if Kennedy's death is destined or just his own convictions that was it not.  Also complicating matters is that Epping's time travel has him arriving five years before Kennedy's assassination.  It is in the past that Epping finds the life he always wanted when he meets soul mate and falls in love.  The novel then deals with Epping fighting the allure of the past and the probable loss of the love he thought he would never have against his conviction that saving Kennedy will change the world for the better.  As with many of Stephen King books, \\"11/22/63\\" cannot be buttonholed into one genre.  This great novel gives us the excitement of time travel, the romance of the great love story, the horror of loss balanced against the hope of a better future.  I have been reading Stephen King since the publication of Carrie in 1974 and this novel now ranks as one of his best in my opinion.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Great entertainment value. I highly recommend this game for fans of other G5 or hide/seek mystery games. The optional mini-games were a nice addition also.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. It's so fun. Again like I like this game. its so fun it keeps u jessing. It can b a little fustraing but if u go through it step by step it is easier than anything.
B005X7HAAS|1.0|I was really waiting to see this movie but after watching it I was so let down.  It's just a bad gangster movie filled with stereotypes. There is noting groundbreaking about it at all. Unless you like the cast, you are related to the director or you have a deep rooted fear of the Yakuza there is no reason to get it IMO. Everyone knows the Yakuza have a finger fetish and if you get this movie you might cut your own finger off for getting it :)
0756665949|5.0|If you are a fan of Lost, this is the book you have to have.  Every character, detail, and spoiler is in the book as you as the reader can relive your experience of Lost while reading!  It's a must buy!
B000002C2E|5.0|I'm someone who once considered this album overrated but who now considers it one of his best. I remember how I felt in 1997 when it came out. At that point I was enraptured by Dylan as a vocalist but felt he had pretty much lost it as a songwriter since his 1983 effort Infidels which I loved and pretty much everything before that - forgetting about the weaker tracks, as you do. In 1997 I just could not believe this won the Grammy ahead of OK Computer and thought there's is no way they could have actually properly listened to the Radiohead classic as it was so obviously so much better. I hadn't bought into the Dylan 'comeback' of Oh Mercy although I did like the track 'Series Of Dreams' a lot. i would say 'Oh Mercy was an improvement over the previous records that had been Dylan's nadir but still no way was he back to his best. Again, 'Under the Red sky' was ok but still not back to Infidels quality and before. The two covers albums both had tremendous songs on them such as Jim Jones - he still had the x factor, so to speak, albeit cover versions.  My early impression of 'Time Out of Mind' was that it had some tuneful tracks much like Oh Mercy and `Under the Red Sky' - those would be 'Love Sick', 'Cold Irons Bound' and 'Can't wait' and I ended up finding the follow up 'Love and Theft' to be better. I still think 'Mississippi' 'High Water', 'Honest With Me' and 'Po Boy' are genuine classics and the best of the late period song writing efforts. I found the production on Time Out Of Mind irritating and hardly ever listened to it, hitting bootlegs of live shows to hear new Dylan.  Something has happened though and I don't know what it is :) My appreciation of 'Time Out Of Mind' has soared. It is a mood piece. It is all about the blues. It has hit me very hard that this is consistently brilliant from beginning to end and is a totally unique album - an older man's record. It's not trying to rock out or find musical hooks. It's bluesy and chilled all the way with an incredible lyricist choosing a spoken word style of delivery, singing the blues from the heart. I now have no desire to hit the skip button - it doesn't even enter my head. Like 'Nashville Skyline' , 'Blood On the Tracks' and 'Infidels' we have a Dylan masterpiece where the album works as an album with the no skip thing going on. Comparing albums from different eras is perhaps pointless, but anyway, I don't think anything on here is as good as say 'Sad Eyed Lady Of The Lowlands', or whatever, but Blonde on Blonde had some lesser tracks and that is the thing about many a Dylan album. Unevenness caused by reaching high heights indeed. This ones is special when listened to as an album as a whole though and although 'Love and Theft' had some INCREDIBLE songs it is a touch uneven. TooM is a smooth, consistent listen.
B00664AM5C|5.0|Loved every second of the movie, scary to think of this actually happening; movie portrays exactly how an epidemic could start and spread in today's world.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I really like this Kindle cover.  It is durable, easy to wipe off, and I really like the easel stand.  Use that feature a lot while playing games.  All in all, I'd buy it again.
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|I wanted this book to be better than it was, because I truly do like John Green's writing. 3 stars is as much as I can give it, though, because when all was said and done I was left with an unsatisfied feeling.  Green is a talented writer, and all of his humor and wit and biting commentary are in good form throughout this book. My main gripe was with the characters he created. I'm all for smart kids. I also understand the point of bringing across the sort of growth and emotional maturity one must come into when faced with a terminal illness. Still, these teenagers very rarely felt like teenagers.  These characters often seemed overwraught and almost like caricatures of themselves. During an emergency, our protagonist Hazel dials 9-1-1 and proclaims something like, \\"The great love of my life Augustus Waters has a malfunctioning g-tube.\\" Really? REALLY? Moments like that brought me out of the story because it's overdone.  I didn't cry but that was probably a bi-product of not feeling particularly attached to the characters. I read a lot about the love between Augustus and Hazel, but it was always flat. It seemed to just be true, because it was written that way. What's more, all of the characters in this book seemed to be copies of each other, especially in the case of the three main kids. What's the personality difference between Augustus and Hazel? What's the difference in their voice? You'd be hard pressed to find one.  It's a good book with nice moments of commentary on life, death and suffering, all when it doesn't get too preachy or too overdone. Not Green's best, but still decent.
0312641893|4.0|First off, don't you just love this cover?! From the first time I saw it I wanted to get this book and read it. Yup, I love a good cover!<br /><br />Cinder is a cyborg. She lives with her guardian and 2 step sisters. Yes, this is a retelling of Cinderella.<br /><br />Cinder is a mechanic in the marketplace. She can repair just about anything.  Prince Kai, the soon to be emperor of New Beijing, brings his android for Cinder to fix. Cinder can't believe when the prince seems to be flirting with her. But Cinder knows that she can never be attractive to him once he finds out that she is cyborg.<br /><br />When the dreaded plague attacks Cinders step-sister Peony, Cinders step-mother immediately volunteers Cinder to go to the palace research facility to be tested on for a cure. No cyborg that is tested on ever comes out alive.<br /><br />When Kai's father dies from the plague Kai is made emperor. Being forced to marry the Lunar queen in order to save earth from war, Kai holds a ball to announce his coming marriage. Barely able to be civil to the queen, Kai is determined to save his people from war with the Lunar's. Cinder has found a hidden chip in Kai's android that will expose the Lunar queen's plans for war. She must go to the ball in order to inform Kai before it is too late.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story and am looking forward to the next book in the series. Cinder kind of reminded me of the Uglies, Pretties, Specials series by Scott Westerfeld. I don't even know why? Maybe because of the post-apocalyptic flavor to it? Maybe because of the advanced technology? Whatever the reason, with robots, spacecraft, cyborgs, romance and evil queens and step-mothers Cinder is a fun read and a great new twist to the Cinderella story!
B000002J1U|5.0|I just want to say every Led Zeppelin album is great!!!!!!!!!!!!And Jimmy Page is a genius not only is he a mastermind with his axe but he is a musical genius.

B005Z271Y6|5.0|This blu ray is amazing...Adele will steal your heart with her voice, unabashed honesty, hilarious stories behind the music.  The venue is beautiful the band wonderful including a small string section.  The CD of the concert omits the stories and between song chatter.  A fair amount of swearing but thats Adele she says it and sings it honestly.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|Got this during app of the day. Put on my phone first and was able to work over my PC from both wifi and 3G.  Then got a Toshiba tablet and installed there. Awesome is the word. My first remote desktop and most likely, the last one I will use.  One more thing, this was her hubby - the family geek. :-)
B0068TL23G|4.0|Router is a challenging puzzle game where the object is to connect pairs of endpoints without crossing paths.  Even if you have done printed circuit board layouts this game will challenge your spatial dimensional skills. (coplanar matrix theory)  The downside is the UI.  You can not click on a particular trace to edit it, but rather you must delete the traces completed in the reverse order they were completed.  Maybe that was intentional to make you keep the entire puzzle visualized but I feel it was just sloppy design ... e.g. too complicated for the programmers.  Also the navigation buttons and \\"undo\\" button are difficult to press reliably ... way too small and often unresponsive...frustrating.  Regardless of the UI \\"complaints\\" the puzzles are very challenging and it will provide you with lots of fun for hours on end.  Hint: Go to the settings and check \\"Maintain Stage Route\\" so you can bring up a completed puzzle (stage) without erasing what was done.
0385534639|5.0|This is definitely one of the best novels I have read in years!  Beautifully written, amazingly imaginative, and a grand love story that is not mushy. I can't believe this is Morgenstern's debut novel, she nailed it!
076115728X|5.0|\\"Beautiful OOPS!\\" is about mistakes and how to make something fancy out of them.  It is also about using your imagination.<br /><br />Kids would like this book because it's about being creative, the pictures are funny and it's colorful.  They would also like all the stuff to do in the book, like lifting all the flaps.<br /><br />My favorite parts were the whole book.<br /><br />Adults and kids of every age would like this book and both boys and girls, too.<br /><br />It gets 5 stars!<br /><br />Reviewed by Young Mensan Lila, age 5

B004TTZHBK|1.0|Zolmo seems not to give a tinkers cu$$ about supporting Amazon with updates.. using with galaxy nexus causes repeated unsuccessful download even when app is uninstalled. 5 emails to developer... nothing. Do I have to pay them $7 to get the update on the market, just so I can have a clean uninstall?
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very pleased with my lightweigh microshell cover.  As i was looking to buy one i saw many prices more than i wanted to pay.  So this item for it's 29.99 works and i didn't have to pay the higher prices.  Great and very pleased.
B0052OWGYW|5.0|Loved the original with Charles Bronson (worth a look if you like this one) but think I like this version even better. Of course this is an action movie with lots of explosions, cars blowing up, gunfire and all this is well paced, sprinkled, throughout the movie. Perhaps more than anything, I like how the writers reworked the script of the original film and made it their own. This one I recommend for an action junky as can be watched more than once.
B003M8LL6E|5.0|This would have been an awesome way to end this series !  I understand why they couldn't end the show after season 5  Still would have been a fine ending . I'll still watch seaon 6 :)
B000V1Z8KK|3.0|More action than sniper. Decent set of actors well cast in their roles. Wahlerg? At least you always know what you are going to get with him. LOL. Plot? Totally predictable but enjoyable anyway. Audience? Male, 20+ years. Not a date movie or to be watched with a female. Oh, there is a token female but not much more than that: token. Watched more than once? Barely, as not non-stop action.
B006OFN0BQ|4.0|While I enjoyed this film from Clint Eastwood it is my belief that it could have been better.  The film begins with J Edgar Hoover developing a filing system, so why does the last stages not contain any mention of the FBI adopting computers - as basic as they were in 1972- unless Hoover lost his early fascination with technology ?.  Also much is made of using early films portraying the FBI and how there attitude to the G-MEN changed,  however there is no mention of \\"THE FBI\\" television series for whatever reason ?.  And lastly while much time is spent over the Lindburgh child abduction ... much much time ...  there is no mention of World War 2, perhaps it was not important enough ?.
B006MQRLSA|1.0|And so Oscar nominated for best picture of 2011???? And Brad Pitt for best actor??? You have to be kidding me on both accounts. This is a slow, very slow, drama with a subject most will care little about.  My take on this movie is that it was a Brad Pitt project of some kind and in retrospect, should have been very cheap to produce as really not much more than a stage play with limited scenery sets and actors. Honestly, how could anyone get all that emotionally involved in a movie that has only \\"baseball team member selection\\" at its core???? Intended audience?  Perhaps 30+ year old males with a love of baseball but no one else. If you have a wife or girlfriend and although they may love Pitt, do not try this movie on them. No sex, no violence, no nothing of note or interest. Oscar nomination for best picture????? \\"The Help\\" is 1000 times better in all reguards that this turkey. Not recommended.
0470901071|5.0|While I did not end up taking the CCNA test, after going thru this book, I had a high level of confidence that I could pass.  Well written good title.
B000ICXQF6|4.0|Another time travel movie but decently crafted plot (some mystery to it so not totally predictable) and even better scenery. Several good actors with Brad Pitt playing a great role and even Bruce Willis is good in this one. If a lover of SYFY, recommended but not a must see. Audience? SYFY lovers. Not a date movie.

B005GYGCOI|2.0|I purchased this ebook in the hope that it would compare with the printed version (and to lighten my travel bag), and was very disappointed.  I typically buy Lonely Planet guidebooks and I do appreciate their detailed coverage and practical advice.  However the Kindle version does not even come close to the experience of reading the paper copy for many reasons.  I tried using it on my Kindle device, on my Android phone, and also on my Windows PC.  It didn't matter which device I used - they all were way less than satisfactory.  Here are some of the reasons:  1. Bookmarks are good for reading books, but not for tagging pages of a travel guide because the bookmark navigation only shows the first sentence of two from the page.  Half the time this is not helpful to figure out what was bookmarked, especially basic information like which city or region this page refers to.  And when I click on the bookmark to see, it still is not always obvious which section I am reading (see #4).  2. You cannot view two pages at once (side by side) on the PC application so browsing one page at a time is slow and makes it challenging to refer back to the previous (related) page.  For example when you are examining a schedule of train times and distances that spans two pages.  3. This book makes major use of links between pages.  However it is too easy to follow a link on Kindle for Android to another page in the book, and accidentally hit the phone's back/previous button and end up closing the app.  The Kindle Back button is hidden in a menu, requiring two clicks, and my natural tendency is to click the back (hardware) button on the bottom of my phone.  4. When browsing and reading a travel guide I tend to skip around a lot to find interesting places to visit or useful advice.  In this case it is too easy to lose track of which city or region I am reading about and there is no visual indicator as to which section of the book I am currently viewing (like highlighted in the table of contents on the left).  For example I might be at a page titled \\"Eating and Drinking\\" but I cannot tell what city it refers to.  6. Links to \\"Offline Map\\" go to the map in the book which is helpful when roaming without a data plan.  However the link does not mention which numbered icon on the map is the restaurant, hotel, or attraction in question.  You must page forward several times (past the blurry zoomed in map sections) to get to the list of items and then go back to the map, finally remember to hit the Back button to return to the previous section of the book.  I now realize that travel guides to individual cities are great on the Kindle, however ones that are of this scope and magnitude are not useful in electronic format the way Kindle works today.  I hope improvements in the future will offer a better reading experience for these type of travel guidebooks so they are not treated like novels.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible!  Tons of translations and easy to navigate.  I have this app on both my phone and Kindle Fire.
0316010669|2.0|Interesting enough but to add any real depth and concrete info Mr. Gladwell should do further research into the conscious and unconscious minds. The entire book discussed the surface matter (Blink) but without any  clue about the actual foundation (namely the conscious and unconscious minds). I was very disappointed with the book as there was no significant conclusion or something concrete I could take away that would have meant the time I used reading the book was worthwhile. The book is just story after story that backs up his blink theory...I got it after the first 2 and did not need to read another 20 all saying and proving the exact same thing. Meaningless and pointless and yes I'm disappointed because this was my first Gladwell book and it will definitely be my last.

0091939526|4.0|This book has several different topics, from losing weight to the big O.  The best part of the book is reading how the author has tried many different and expensive approaches and then gives you his best advice on what actually works.  If you are looking for a perfect fit for your lifestyle and body type, go to a nutritionist and get a personal trainer.  If you would like to read about a crazy millionaire taking his own health to the extreme, buy this book.

0312611692|4.0|This is one of the most intriguing books on history I had ever read. The others are so boring, not to mention the low quality/accuracy writing particularly on ancient China. (I am a Hong Kong born Chinese who studied Chinese history for years so you have to trust me on that). I do buy into the author's own theory (pg28), that &#34;Change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things. And they rarely know what they're doing. History teaches us that when the pressure is on, change takes off.&#34; Nevertheless, I am obliged to express my objection to his conclusion that geography had played a very important part in shaping our past. Furthermore, IMHO, as technology is so fundamental to historical change, and technological breakthrough is simply unpredictable, nobody can really make any prediction of our future at all. Anyway, I strongly recommend this book to all who love to read. Per Winston Churchill (pg13), The farther backward you can look, the farther forward you are likely to see.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some favorite passages of mine for your reference.<br />Because they had no rivals, most Chinese emperors worried more about how trade might enrich undesirable groups like merchants than they did about getting more riches for themselves; and because the state was so powerful, they could stamp out this alarming practice. In the 1430s they banned oceanic voyages, and in the 1470s perhaps destroyed Zheng's records, ending the great age of Chinese exploration. pg17<br />History, n.. An account, mostly false, of events, mostly unimportant, which are brought about by rulers, mostly knaves, and soldiers, mostly fools. - Ambrose Bierce. pg26<br />Progress is made by lazy men looking for easier ways to do things. - Heinlein Theorem pg27<br />Change is caused by lazy, greedy, frightened people looking for easier, more profitable, and safer ways to do things. And they rarely know what they're doing. - Morris Theorem pg28
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is one of those albums that are essential for Rush fans or just people that like music in general. It's arguably their best album to date and one of the best albums of all time. Even if it's not your favorite Rush album, it's probably one of your favorites. It's a must have for people that are into their heavier/harder rock music from the mid '70s, their more progressive/complex music from the late '70s or their electronic music from the mid-late '80s. If you're new to Rush than this is the best place to start. It has their classic hit Tom Sawyer and it also has Limelight. My personal favorite track is Vital Signs and one of my favorite Rush songs.
0307591549|4.0|If it were not for the odd jargon/name which the author created for the seven specific, actionable and proven patterns that he theorized to predict success and achievement (The Happiness Advantage; The Fulcrum and the Lever; The Tetris Effect; Falling up; The Zorro Circle; The 20-Second Rule; Social Investment), this book is nearly perfect in term of wisdom, helpfulness and readability. Dont let the misperception that you know well \\"being happy is important\\" deter you from it. Read it asap, and you will thank my strong recommendation later.<br /><br />p.s. Below please find some of my favorite passages for your reference.<br />Spending money on experiences, especially one with other people (prosocial spending), produces positive emotions that are both more meaningful and more lasting (than on stuff). Pg54<br />It takes about three positive comments, experiences, or expressions to fend off the languishing effects of one negative. Dip below this tipping point, (the Losada Line), and workplace performance quickly suffers. Pg61<br />The mental construction of our daily activities, more than the activity itself, defines our reality. Pg71<br />What identity are you wearing today? If you're sporting self-doubt, you've undercut your performance before you even begin. So when faced with a difficult task or challenge, give yourself an immediate competitive advantage by focusing on all the reasons you will succeed, rather than fail. Remind yourself of a time you have been in a similar circumstance in the past and performed well. Pg75<br />We are not imprisoned by our circumstances, our setbacks, our history, our mistakes, or even staggering defeats along the way. We are freed by our choices. - Jim Collins pg109<br />Things do not necessarily happen for the best, but some people are able to make the best out of things that happen. - Tal Ben-Shahar pg111<br />Watching TV and trolling around on Facebook might be easier and more convenient than biking or looking at art or playing soccer, they don't offer the same rewards.

B006P8KKYW|5.0|After working together for the soundtrack to The Social Network, they teamed up again for another. I really enjoyed The Social Network soundtrack so I gave this one a listen and also enjoyed it. It's a little different in genre but I'd say it's about equal in quality. Ever since NIN broke up and before Trent Reznor started doing instrumental music. The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo sounds a little closer to NIN though. A few songs sound an instrumental track from \\"The Fragile\\".

B0009HKH6Q|4.0|\\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" is a triumph of style over substance that, remarkably, is as stylish today as it was in 1968. Thomas Crown (Steve McQueen) is a rich, thrill-seeking Boston businessman, unsatisfied with life's ordinary challenges. So he masterminds back robberies for the fun of it. He co-ordinates a 5-person heist of $2.6 million by telephone from his office. There is nothing to connect him to the crime. Police detective Eddie Malone (Paul Burke) hits a dead end, so the insurance company insists on bringing in a special investigator to assist Malone. She is beautiful, cunning Vicki Anderson (Faye Dunaway). Malone is skeptical of her abilities, but Thomas Crown cannot resist a challenge when Vicki tells him outright that she intends to nail him for the crime.<br /><br />There is nothing realistic about any of  this, and director Norman Jewison, who openly declared the film to be an exercise in style, doesn't pretend that there is. It was written by Boston lawyer Alan Trustman about idealized characters whose behavior does not strictly make sense. Nevertheless, Thomas Crown is iconic and appealing. Played against type by Steve McQueen, Crown is a sophisticate who wants to screw the system from which he has profited so richly. Crown can't stand a day without a challenge. He collects art, romances beautiful women, flies a glider plane, plays polo, and golfs on Sunday, because that is the only challenge available on Sundays. Asked what he has to worry about, Crown replies, \\"Who I want to be tomorrow.\\" In the anti-establishment 1960s, he is a kind of posh anti-hero.<br /><br />Vicki Anderson is shrewd and admittedly mercenary. \\"I'm immoral. So is the world. I'm here for the money, okay?\\" she explains. Vicki gets ten percent of the money recovered. And she knows exactly how to get under Thomas Crown's skin. She doesn't bother to try to deceive him. She offers him a challenge upfront by declaring her intentions. Her unorthodox methods unnerve Malone. Oddly, though Vicki is gutsy and cunning, she seems ill-educated in the law and a little ditzy. She was written with one foot in and one foot out the door of 1960s feminism. Her relationship with Thomas Crown leaves the audience guessing. Is this a romance or a game of cat and mouse? Who's fooling whom? We can wonder while we watch the gorgeous couple do exciting, expensive things.<br /><br />Norman Jewison uses split screen when he wants the camera to be in more than one place at a time. It looks great. \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" was also one of the first films to use handheld cameras, by cinematographer Haskell Wexler. Jewison has spoken of how much creative freedom they had. They constantly experimented with the camera, creating memorable images and juxtapositions. Dialogue is spare. It's surprising how well a movie with little substance and lots of style holds up more than 40 years later. Don't expect depth or realism, but \\"The Thomas Crown Affair\\" does hold up. It's enjoyable. And, like its original audiences, I can't get its Oscar-winning theme song \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" out of my head now.<br /><br />The DVD (MGM 2005): This is a double-sided disc with widescreen on one side and full screen on the other. You're probably better off watching widescreen even if you don't have a widescreen television, because of the split screen multiple images in the film. Bonus features are a theatrical trailer (2 min) and an audio commentary by director Norman Jewison. It's a good audio commentary with a little of everything. Jewison explains the rationale behind the split screens, talks about the cast, themes, camerawork, recalls filming. Subtitles are available for the film in English, Spanish, French.unning, she seems ill-educated in the law and a little ditzy.

B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is amazing. I can see why many think it's a great YA series but I am not a young adult and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

I will probably re-read the trilogy at some point as well, it was that good.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|The watch is good and keeps excellent time.  I haven't had it under water (yet).  No Seiko instruction or warranty booklet was enclosed, only a generic folded piece of glossy paper.  I asked about that and per conversation with an Amazon representative was told to send the watch back with a prepaid UPS label. (I did not understand the reason for such trouble. All I wanted was the booklet.)  I did so and received a replacement.  This time the strap had a defective buckle. It is useless.  The buckle will disconnect because one of two places for the spring pin is almost non-existent.  So I installed my own band I had at home.  Amazon emailed me that they had sent me the Seiko pamphlet on line.  I haven't checked it.  All this for merely requesting a booklet which was included in another Seiko I bought from Amazon.  I am surprised and disappointed in Amazon.  Never had a problem with them until now, which includes some kind of refund they say I am due. I emailed them and said that is not so.  I have not heard back.  Said email was sent January 21.

B0045LSIRM|5.0|My introduction to this album was via a few clips on YouTube (to be honest, I didn't know about it prior to that), so I had some idea of what to expect - but in fairness I have to say it beat all expectations hands down. I like a lot of Bryan's work, so most of the songs are familiar to me, but what impresses me most about the album is the wealth of experience you can hear in how he performs. This album is a classic example of what Malcolm Gladwell talks about - the \\"10,000-hour rule\\" - claiming that the key to success in any field is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing a specific task for a total of around 10,000 hours.<br /><br />I'm sure Bryan has way more than 10,000 hours under his belt and you can hear that clearly on this album. He knows exactly when to involve the crowd, when to lighten the atmosphere a bit with a joke or a funny story, when to rock it (yes, with an acoustic) and when to tone it down. It's all there.<br /><br />Speaking of acoustic guitar - some of the tones he gets are superb and they offer an interesting backdrop to the various songs. The piano player does exactly what he's supposed to do - add something to the song without getting in the way. He's there and he's not there, so to speak. The harmonica adds an extra touch to the overall sound and so you never get bored because there is enough happening at all times.<br /><br />...and the voice. In my opinion, Bryan is one of the few artists who seems to be able to add something to the vocal in a live situation, rather than give you the feeling that something is missing (like a lot of other live recordings). That's no mean feat as his records are well produced and his voice on the original cuts is very, very strong. This guy just doesn't sing flat or off-key ever (I checked out several other live clips on YouTube). Amazing!!<br /><br />Back to the album or the tracks. There are some new songs on it and that's a good thing. No matter how well a song is sung, or how many times it's been re-arranged, you can get tired of seeing it show up over and over again on different albums. There is a real nice mix on this album.<br /><br />To sum up...if you're someone who likes a good live album, enjoys acoustic music, appreciates musicians who can actually play their instruments well, then I can safely say - you'll love this album.it show up over and over again on different albums.

0446569895|5.0|This book is awesome! I'm always a fan of Ozzy like my Dad, I bought this book right after I saw it on an online book review. The story of Ozzy is just hilarious, it is very addicting to read the book again and again. The book came in perfect condition, the hard cover wasn't torn and folded, the pages are new, with the plastic picture pages in the middle. Recommend this to people who loves Ozzy, for simply funny stuff.

B000N4SHOE|5.0|Whimsical, winsome, enchanting, artistic are all words that apply to this wondrous film.  It is one of my favorite films of the last decade as the illustrations of Peter Rabbit come to life.  It captures the Edwardian age and the flavor of how we imagine the creator of Peter Rabbit to be.  Rene Zellwegger is magical in her role as Miss Potter.  The scenery and sets are divine. It's a perfect family film and one you can watch over and over.  If you love films about creative women who triumph in their times despite societal constraints, this is one of those celebratory stories.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I dont get why you would need this app!!I have a real Bible in my home as does all of my relatives I think everyone should have one in their home too.Though I still think its ok to have one for on the go,it translates too much and changes the meaning of the Bible!!
B0018M6J90|5.0|This movie has the rhythm and cadence of a Cole Porter song and Fred Astair dance. If you like stories about love between interesting people of a certain age, this movie offers it. It's one of my favorite romantic comedies combining a saucy style with panache. It will transport you to the dazzling and decadent decade of the 1930's in London between the wars.<br /><br />I love stories in which a bit of serendipity transforms and improves lives. Miss Pettigrew's life gets a dazzling do-over in 24 hours when love intervenes. Whimsical and original, this movie is simply adorable. It captures the frothy flavor of the book of the same name which was written in 1938. If you're a bit of a quirky romantic, you should enjoy it.

B000TEUSJK|4.0|I purchased this video because Helen Mirren starred in it. I'm a big fan of hers. However, it was not at all what I thought it would be. At the start, I thought it would be another \\"Ceasar\\" and his gladiators type of movie, but it turned out to be something totally different. It borders on a XXX rating but, it actually had a story line to it. Aside from the graphical, provocative nature of the movie, it wasn't all that bad. I have watched it at least 3 times already.
B000XVSU9O|5.0|So, we finished Heaven Is For Real in just over two days.  Feeling moved by Todd Burpo's story, my wife found another book relating to NDE's (near death experiences) and found Embraced By The Light in our home library.  We both dove into it and are blown away at the common spiritual thread that little Colton and Betty J. Eadie both share, especially of getting to know our savior, Jesus, as a close friend and loving guide.  If you get the chance to read these two books in succession, you may just be moved (spiritually) more than you could ever expect!  Enjoy!!!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|After trying two other cases ordered from Amazon, I finally think I found the perfect one.  I wanted something not too bulky, that didn't deter from the sleekness and elegance of the white 4s and that would offer some cushion in a fall.  The case was easy to put on, super clear , slim and nonintrusive and feels great in the hand.  It feels solid and secure when holding my phone and has enough cushion to it to at least make feel like it might offer some protection in a drop.  I was able to dock it my alarm clock with a little extra nudge.  So far, the battery has not seemed to over heat in the case.  I can't comment on the screen protector (hate them), nor can I comment on yellowing as I've not used it long enough but I figure for the cheap price, it can easily be replaced with another.

B006PAZMMK|2.0|Sorry to go against the grain but this album is mediocre at best.  Skrillex isn't changing his sound and isn't changing as an artist.  It all sounds the same.  I guess it's working for others, as clearly he is seeing massive success, but as someone who liked his previous stuff....I hate say it but his music is getting old.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|I'm not sure why I hadn't bought this cd sooner, being a huge A7X fan! The album is a lot harder than their newest album and overall a good cd. I love their version of Pantera \\"Walk.\\" Buy this, you won't regret it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|Riordan fashions a modern tale of the Olympians that will keep you turning the pages with \\"The Lightning Thief.\\" Percy Jackson is a 6th grader with a lot of problems. Diagnosed with ADHD and dyslexia, school isn't easy for him. His step-father is barely civil to him. Then there's a horde of monsters who want to kill him. Things only get more complicated when he discovers he's a son of Poseidon.<br /><br />Percy is not invited back to his school, so his mother takes him down to the coast to spend some quality time with him. Unfortunately, their time together is ruined when monsters attack. Percy's mom hurries to get him to Camp Half-Blood where he'll be protected, but not before she disappears.<br /><br />At the camp, Percy meets his old teacher, Chiron, and learns he's a demigod - a half blood, son of a mortal woman and the god Poseidon. A part of him is thrilled to finally find a place where he belongs with friends, Luke, Annabeth, and Grover. A part of his is sad over the loss of his mother.<br /><br />After visiting the oracle, Percy's given a quest. Zeus' lightning bolt has been stolen. Zeus holds his brothers, Poseidon and Hades responsible. Percy must discover who has stole the bolt and why. His journey takes him across America with Annabeth and Grover. Will Percy embrace his heritage as Poseidon's son, or will he turn his back on the Olympians?<br /><br />Riodan's writing is crisp and sharp, engaging the reader from the get-go. His creativity shines, giving the Greek gods a unique, modern spin that allows them to relate to young readers while fueling their curiosity about Greek mythology.<br /><br />Riodan uses a good economy of words to paint vivid pictures of his settings. The plot never lingers, moving at a brisk pace while holding the reader's attention.<br /><br />The main characters are interesting and complex, each having to face their problems. Percy can channel a lot of power as Poseidon's son, but he must learn to tame his emotions so he can grow as a hero. Annabeth craves her father's love, but finds it difficult to fit into his world as Athena's daughter. Grover wants nothing more than to prove himself worthy to receive a seeker's license, but the path his must take challenges his courage and bravery.<br /><br />What I enjoyed most was watching Percy grow as a character. He's got a good heart, but unless his traits are channeled in a positive way, he'll never discover his true potential, and that's a message middle school children can relate to.<br /><br />\\"The Lightning Thief\\" is well written, riveting, and full of action that will take young readers on the adventure of a lifetime.ficult to fit into his world as Athena's daughter.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|It's a nice app but the level of permissions it requires are just plain ridiculous.  If it weren't for the outlandish level of permissions, it's probably the best weather app.
B0024F08UG|4.0|Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />The 2.35:1 (or 2.40:1 - it is hard to tell the difference) video presentation was great to excellent.  I didn't see any grain at all.  I give it a 9.5 on a 10.0 scale.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 5.1 Master audio was disappointing.  I thought I heard sound from the surround speakers once during the movie, but I wasn't sure.  I think the ending music had some surround sound.  But during the movie, 99% of the sound came from the center or front speakers, and I couldn't hear any stereo separation coming from the front left and right speakers.  The sound just seemed to come from the center speaker.<br /><br />Overall, a good Blu-Ray purchase, because of the great video quality.
B0058EA3MS|5.0|I would not recommend this movie to anyone with a short attention span.  It is long and drawn out, and there are no jarring moments.  It just sort of flows along.  But the performances are superb.  Especially Lesley Manville and Imelda Staunton.  Imelda is not in the movie much, but when she is, she is riveting.  Lesley Manville's character is so well developed and convincingly acted that you quickly identify with her - warts and all.  This movie is very sad at times, but not depressing.  The relationship between the husband and wife is heart warming.  Highly recommended.
B003JIPJRE|5.0|I know many people have issues with the Joker's new voice. It is very different, but imagine this... The joker is older. It think it fit that sorta idea.<br />I really liked Jensen Ackles as Red Hood. He played it well with a sorta Deadpool twist. I thought that when it came to the serious parts he was able to switch really well.<br />The animation is very nice. I concur with Anelka24, '...This movie brings me back to the days where I would watch Batman Beyond or the first animated Batman series...'<br />IT has the dark mature feel, but isn't unnecessary. All the blood and drama fit in nicely and don't take anything away. If you like Batman, check this out!

0140620516|4.0|A classic novella with an impact much bigger than its size.<br /><br />I was struck by the huge impact that this book's theme has had on the media from Burgess' CLOCKWORK ORANGE, werewolf movies, THE EXORCIST, THE INVINCIBLE HULK to an old Robert Silverberg sci-fi novel THE SECOND TRIP about a man condemned by the state to have his identity erased only to find his synthetic identity being dominated by his old evil nature.<br /><br />The idea of a controlling id nature battling a super-ego (good) personality has a deep influence in our culture. Stevenson's own Calvinism predates the notion that biochemistry controls destiny, yet both create a destiny of doom that Stevenson explores with genius.In Stevenson's short story MARKHEIM, the devil is overcome by faith that defeats evil in a contrasting twist to this little masterpiece.<br /><br />Dr. Jekyll, a kind, socially conscious doctor, carefully constructs a parallel life he creates through a noxious mixture of chemicals only to find that unknown impurities in the chemicals made his transformation to the horrifying Hyde temporary. The pure chemicals make Hyde a dark permanent companion.<br /><br />The last chapter is a existential discussion on how Hyde becomes Dr. Jekyll's desired companion and then his doom. Hyde's murder of an English MP is Cain living in Jekyll's Able. The blood of the murder cries from the ground and, yet paradoxically condemns both natures in one life. Near the sad end of this tragic tale, Dr. Jekyll stares in horror at the permanent image of Hyde in the mirror as he realizes he can never regain his good self, yet shouldn't we be resigned when we confront the evil resident in ourselves as Original Sin?<br /><br />The Victorian English in this translation is bearable which makes it a good short read as we confront the evil of boredom.
0307593312|5.0|Murakami has oudone himself in this brilliant, characteristically surreal, enigmatic book centering on a woman who kills abusive men and a math tutor (unsuccessful aspiring writer) who ghost-writes a book that becomes an instant sensation. Skirting the bounds of reality and fantasy in typical Murakami fashion, the convolutions of the plot are thoroughly entertaining and absorbing despite the book's almost thousand page length. A great, arresting read that one longs to finish in a single sitting.
B005LLXBYA|5.0|sat on the fence thinking about buying this for a while, glad i did finally pull the trigger. supreme value in this package. if one was even remotely fond of dance music, they would not be disappointed in this set of masterfully built set of rarities and edits. packaging is great with cardboard slipcase and mini lp like sleeves for the discs, and liner notes are very clever/informative and double as a poster of the cover;)  al kent is the man behind the curtain when it comes to assembling this monster. check him out and his million dollar disco / million dollar orchestra projects. i'd never even heard of him until stumbling across this.
0446573019|1.0|Baldacci's hero seemed modeled on Jack Reacher.  I read his books when Jeffrey Deaver's and/or Lee Child's works aren't available, and am usually entertained.  But Zero Day is not one of Baldacci's better works. Not an absorbing read.

0679720200|5.0|This book has earned a bad reputation based on the plot along with the Cure's song, \\"Killing an Arab\\". However, DON'T FEED INTO THIS. Once you read the book and listen to the song, it all makes sense. I don't want to recap the plot for you, or go into great detail about the characters. Just read it. It's a classic. The end.
1401937519|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading Anita's book after hearing her speak in Sydney, Australia at the end of January.  Her NDE experience is profound.  The wisdom she shares is life changing.  And the energy with which she communicates her message is the most compelling example of what it means to know - really know - the truth about life.  Her presence is her message and everyone would benefit from reading this book!

B00631VJLE|4.0|LC is my favorite band so I knew I would be getting a hard copy of Dark Adrenaline, and would have gone with the basic cd had I realized the deluxe edition's poster was basically just a close up of the alum cover, same with the sticker. Plus the dvd is just the shorts they have online. Lame. I love the cd, can't stop listening, but I should have spent less on just the cd.
B00005QX8O|1.0|This is a great movie, but if you read the small print you will see that this DVD is for Region Two.  It will work fine on your DVD player if you live in Japan or Egypt but not if you live in the USA.  Well there goes more money down the drain.
B0019EXZY4|5.0|The title is an intentional understatement concerning what this movie's about. The central story does deal with a clever bank heist by a group of London Eastenders, but it's only a part of a complex tapestry involving spies from MI-5, a charismatic black leader whose secret life is drug smuggling, a madam who takes photos of her aristocratic and kinky clientele, a royal princess whose penchant for group sex might topple the monarchy, a pornographer/pimp who keeps a ledger of all the corrupt London police officers that he bribes, plus a few love stories and a few murders. Beautifully written, directed and acted by an exceptional cast led by Jason Statham, this fascinating look at corruption at the highest and lowest levels of British society during the late 1960s is sure to please the discerning viewer. It also provides a nice acting stretch for Mr. Statham, who winningly succeeds as a would-be master thief in over his head.
B005V1WVPA|2.0|This is a new Korn album entitled \\"Path of Totality\\". I like korn's 1st album and  occasionally check out their new stuff to see if they are doing anything heavy. This time they're not. Hopefully people who seek out this here album will discover \\"Path of Totality\\" by TOMBS! Far, far superior in the metal realm.

6305313687|5.0|If you live by the sword... someone else may point that sword in a different direction. This movie plays on the thin edge between good man - evil man in a most interesting way. When you watch the story unfolding and you remove yourself from the rhetoric played, you sense the purpose of the bible coming to life. Should you ever ask, why am I born... or what is the purpose of my life... this story takes you right to that answer. We are born to struggle with all forces made available in our universe. We are born to answer the roar of the animal within us with the sweetness of The Light.  We are born to balance on the very edge of Destiny determined by \\"Seek and you shall find. But many times the animal wins...

B004NOH9LC|4.0|With the sheer volume of movies being released to theaters every year and the average lifespan of a theatrical movie being 2-3 weeks, it's easy to miss out on some gems.  Morning Glory is one of those. Great performances by the entire cast, but Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton really stand out. In fact, this is Ford's best movie in a long, long time. This was a very enjoyable 2 hours.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I was very impressed with the case when it arrived.  My kindle was seated in place in seconds and by the feel knew it would definitely be secure.  This was tested a few days later when I accidentally dropped on a tile floor with no issues.  The felt on the inside cover is a great addition to this product.  It becomes possible to \\"cling\\" the device onto clothing without sliding.  Convenient for those that like to bend our knees in chairs because the felt causes it to stick on my pants and I can go hands-free.  The flap-stand works well also using the groove in the back of the shell.  I will admit it works out of the box but as the flaps are used more, the stands works better.  I was so impressed by this product, I recommended it to my spouse and father-in-law.

B0050PYNN0|1.0|I'll skip my usual plot summary, as doing so would cause me to lose the will to live. Suffice to say, Your Highness is a stoner comedy where brothers Danny McBride and James Franco have to team up to take on the evil wizard (Justin Theroux) in order to save the kidnapped Zooey Deschanel. A bewildered Natalie Portman helps out for a bit. Suffice to say the good guys win.  Your Highness is a movie that catastrophically fails on numerous levels. First up, it's a stoner comedy which is trying to make the 'add marijuana use to any given scene to make it using' formulae still work. The conceit here is that the film is a high fantasy, so characters breaking out weed whilst on a quest to save the world (or at least the female lead's virginity) is supposed to be tonally jarring and hence amusing. The problem, of course, is that even the serious Lord of the Rings movies had weed jokes in them, so this doesn't really work.  Secondly, the film's leads are rather unlikeable. Danny McBride (also the film's writer) plays Danny McBride, the quintessential supporting man who is best-deployed in short bursts (he worked quite well blowing up an entire jungle in Tropic Thunder and then doing nothing else of note in the film). He can't handle the lead role for an entire movie, and his jokes become repetitive and fall flat. He has occasional moments of competence, but no more. Worse is Franco, who plays his flamboyant, heroic role with all the charisma of a wet blanket, not to mention adopting a bizarre nasal accent that is seriously annoying. Completing a trio of ineptness, Deschanel plays her role as if she is severely concussed for the whole movie, a curious choice from someone who is actually a very good actress.  Supporting actors fare better: Theroux's ferocious, scenery-chewing performance is just what the script calls for and he makes even the most tired gross-out gags amusing. He also gets the best lines. It's therefore a shame he gets relatively little screen-time. Charles Dance, playing the brothers' fierce, authoritarian father (trivia: he was recruited straight from the set of Your Highness to play Tywin Lannister in Game of Thrones), also succeeds by playing his role straight. But again, he's in the film for only a limited period. Portman is more variable, in some scenes phoning it in and in others at least trying to get into the spirit of things. Portman went straight from filming Your Highness to principal photography on Black Swan, which I suspect was a tonal shift so jarring it caused whiplash.  We must take a brief moment to salute Toby Jones, an excellent and interesting actor who in Your Highness has to utterly humiliate himself several times over in the pursuit of McBride's comedic vision, and does so without at any time descending into a towering rage and murdering his co-star with a chainsaw. Such restraint can only be marvelled at.  Another major failing of the film is that it seems to draw inspiration from other, superior movies. When a film is making you think of The Princess Bride, Lord of the Rings or Krull, it's probably not a good idea for the film not to be a patch on any of them.  Your Highness (½ a star and lucky to get that) is not particularly fantastical (having a paedophile muppet wizard doesn't count), definitely not original, is mostly utterly unfunny (some honourable exceptions for Theroux) and almost everyone involved seems to be rather embarrassed by the project. The studio certainly was, sitting on it for more than a year before finally trotting it out somewhat sheepishly to the cinemas, where it promptly bombed. Definitely one to avoid.

B006ZBRMOU|5.0|Oh Fifty, Fifty, Fifty! This is the book that I had been \\"patiently\\" waiting for!! I had stayed up until midnight the day of release so that I could purchase it and start reading right away!<br /><br />The book starts out with Christian and Ana on their honeymoon. Ana keeps flashing back to give us a glimpse of the planning and the wedding day itself. I don't want to give too much away to those that still would like to read the series, so, just know that Christian is struggling in this book to keep a tight rein on his temper. Ana is testing her boundaries to see what she can get away with and what she can't. And can I tell you that she REALLY tests them!! There were some parts where even I was like \\"Are you crazy?\\"<br /><br />The ending was in my opinion..perfect. After all that the two had been through, they deserve a perfect ending! The series was very neatly wrapped up and I was left content and sighing. There is also some bonus material such as...my favorite, a scene from Mr. Grey's POV when Ms. Steele \\"fell into his office\\". I loved reading Christian's thoughts!<br /><br />I am very saddened to see this series come to an end! But, I have fallen so head over heels for these characters that I will be on the lookout for more from EL James! Thank you to Ms. James for creating the handsome Mr. Grey!

B00005JPKE|5.0|A story about the WWII battle of Iwo Jima as seen from the Japanese side.  (A companion piece to Flags of Our Fathers, also created by Clint Eastwood.)  This is definitely not a movie that glorifies war, nor is it a movie that conveys a blatant anti-war message.  It is about honor as a value, a virtue, and about how a plot centering around honor, or doing right because it is right, plays out in the context of the culture of Japanese warriors at Iwo Jima.  It is also about suffering and sacrifice as virtues, whether in war or in any circumstance of human existence.  These values are seen juxtaposed here, at cross purposes, with the human desire to live and love and express compassion.  Even more than being about these general concepts, it's about specific characters who are fellow human beings with whom one can empathize and sympathize.  They are people with whom one can strongly identify; and ultimately, they are people one grows to love and care about very much.  Because the story involves spending a lot of time experiencing distress in battle and other wartime situations, the viewer undertakes to undergo extended unpleasantness, but to experience the story seems to me to be worth the stress because it has great \\"redeeming value.\\" It can deeply touch the heart with love. It is a film that helps to put down enmity such as war typically magnifies.  It can serve to erase racial prejudice and hatred.  The Japanese actors were grateful to Eastwood for making the movie, giving a \\"voice to the voiceless spirits\\" of those Japanese who were involved in the actual battle at Iwo Jima.  The documentation about the making of the movie brings out the fact that the Japanese soldiers went into the battle of Iwo Jima knowing that they were going to their destruction.  The circumstances were such that they could not possibly win.  So, the viewer realizes that both in reality and in the film story, constantly uppermost in the minds and wills and hearts of these men must have been theneed to hold firm to their cultural/religious concepts of death with honor.  The viewer has only to substitute in his imagination concepts from his own most heartfelt faith/culture/religion to feel a meaningful atonement in empathy with the characters of the story.  And of course, being able to identify with their desire to continue to live and love is only human and doesn't take a far stretch of the imagination.  This DVD packet includes an entire disc documenting various aspects of the making of the movie and I found this material just as interesting and worthwhile in its own way as the movie itself.  (A nice subtle touch at the finale of the film, after there's been a peculiar monotonal color scheme throughout, is the appearance of an actual warm-colored sun on the horizon [which is setting and/or rising].  Interesting irony to ponder after multiple scenarios throughout the film involving the sun iconography of the Japanese flag.)
B0055SWM08|5.0|In this game you are trying to get through each level by moving water drops around &amp; collecting pearl-like objects to move forward. The graphics and sound are OK, but the puzzle difficulty is worthy of playing. I really liked it.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|It's only because of the superb performances of Meryl Streep and Jim Broadbent as Margaret and Denis Thatcher that I give \\"The Iron Lady\\" three stars out of five. Without them, it would deserve two at the most. Streep as usual is impeccable; her appearance, voice and mannerisms are so perfect that for long stretches of the movie you forget you're not watching the real Margaret Thatcher. Broadbent as Denis is playful and charmingly dotty; together, he and Streep make the most delightful British Odd Couple since Horace ahd Hilda Rumpole.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Abi Morgan's screenplay is misshapen and wrongheaded, and Phyllida Lloyd's direction lackadaisical. Under their guidance, \\"The Iron Lady\\" becomes mostly the story of the elderly, demented Margaret, living in a fantasy world with the image of her long-dead husband. The story of Margaret's political rise and triumph, in which she once again made Britain--for better or worse--a haven for imperialism and laissez-faire capitalism, is tacked on almost as an afterthought. Of course the political story is the only reason the life of Margaret Thatcher is of any interest, but ironically it's the pitiful story of the elderly, fading Thatcher that holds our interest, strictly because of Streep and Broadbent. If it weren't for them, \\"The Iron Lady\\" would be a total botch.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great extension of the Quell game. It is almost he same game as the first, yet this installment has a golden pearl-like object to break through golden obstructions. I would like to see more alterations similar to this. This is a game to recommend.

For those of you who fall into this category, purchasing this product is a no-brainer.<br /><br />However, for those of you who are lukewarm fans or if you're someone who appreciates a good live show, you have to give this a spin.<br /><br />Justin Timberlake is a master performer.  It is his passion and you see it in every frame of this show.  From the stage setup to lighting, choreography to song selection, this concert has everything a music lover is looking for.<br /><br />He's also insanely entertaining to watch.  His interactions with the crowd, crew and dancers draw you in as if you are right there on the front row.  He flows seamlessly from one song to the next, showcasing his flirtatious charisma as well as his musical genius.<br /><br />Case in point, both my husband AND my brother not only admitted that they loved this show, but have watched it multiple times.  And they are total jam band freaks.<br /><br />The only negative is the cutaway shots of girls who barely know the words but somehow got primo seats.  Those of us who have spent a small fortune supporting his career (who also have zero \\"ins\\" for getting front-row or VIP access) will always envy those who get to experience a performance of this caliber live.  C'est la vie.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have just finished watching the actual Blu-ray, that will be released in the US as indicated above. It was released in Australia yesterday, so I can give a review of the real thing - not conjecture, which applies to most of the &#34;reviews&#34; so far. Before I say anything further, if you have not pre-ordered this yet, do so immediately.<br /><br />I haven't seen the now-closed London production, so I am unable to give comparisons, except in relation to comments I have read. ALW had decided that the show would open London, Melbourne, Broadway. But the Australian director discussed the weaknesses of which ALW was already aware. So he gave total control over all revisions and the show has ended up brilliantly. Made for theater release, the Blu-ray is 2.35:1, not the figure given above. As I have a habit of writing l-o-n-g posts, I will keep this short. I saw the revised stage show here in Melbourne where the film was made, thought it to be among the best musicals I have seen. I think you will find many of the objections have been dealt with.<br /><br />The show, in my mind, has emerged as being among ALWs best works, although it lacks the mass-appeal of &#34;Phantom&#34;, to which this is not truly a sequel. The ability to see close-ups in the disk made the balanced flow of story and music more easily recognized. Universal have done a first-rate job in transferring the show to the screen. There have been no compromises, no cuts other than handling some sene transition in a manner better suited to the screen.<br /><br />The first act (the Blu-ray has no such division) is really spectacular, and the story gets darker as it progresses. Acting, singing, sets, costumes, orchestra and conductor all play their roles in a way that could not be bettered.<br /><br />So, to summarise: a great show, especially for ALW fans who enjoy his more serious work, beautiful video direction, image quality good without quite managing demonstration standards. Sound is exemplary, doing real justice to voices, diction and the orchestra. And at its low price (presumably because of the inferior initial version) and good Blu-ray technical standards, why are you waiting. Order it!<br /><br />Added June 2015. Apparently there are now two productions playing in London; the original, and the Australian. The Australian version has been used in the vast majority of productions around the world.chestra.

B004ZY0VHY|4.0|I had a really hard time getting into this book, the first few chapters were not very engaging to me, but once i got into this book i didn't want to put down.  This subject really intrigues me and I have read many books pertaining to this subject, but I liked that it was from the mothers perspective.....i really didn't see the ending coming, overall it was a good read, i just marked it down a star because i it was an effort for me to keep reading throught the first part.
B005CMSDLE|4.0|Ronan is going to win an Oscar one day. Atonement was no fluke. This is a slightly surreal, coming of age fairy tale type story about Hanna, trained teenage assassin. I say fairy tale because as it progresses, you can start to see its' resemblance to classics such as Snow White and Sleeping Beauty going so far as to actually make reference the Bros. Grimm. Sorry, Cinderella, you're left out. It's style is different than what most American movies are like so I'd waiver between \\"I like it\\" to \\"this is weird.\\" Cate Blanchett is one heck of an actress but there was something off about her here. It's quite a thrill ride but when it was over, I realized that many questions were left unanswered and not just to set up a sequel, just not addressed to a satisfactory end. Still worth it, though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is great...I love it. But whatever you do, do not update this game because you will have to start all over. GET THE GAME YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT, TRUST ME!
B004DI7HZ6|2.0|I was excited to start the story- I do like historical novels and the heroine in this book is an accomplished professor of history AND a witch to boot- so what's not to love?  Well...quite a lot actually.  Diana irritates me- she's a strong woman, but too stubborn to be reasonable, so it just comes off as bitchy. The story is too formulaic: sexy vampire, she doesn't like him, he pretends not to like her because he REALLY wants her (her smell drives him crazy), he protects her from gathering evil forces, they fall in love, but he wants to wait to consummate the union so they don't have sex, etc. etc., ad nauseum.  Heard this one before?  Me too...it's called Twilight.  Except this is worse, because even AFTER they get married, he still doesn't want to have sex.  What??  Why??  All he keeps saying is that there's no need to rush.  I call B.S.  If it was my husband, I'd start to worry that he was gay.  Now there's a bestseller- gay vampire novel!!  :)  What it boils down to is that the author is purposely using the delay of sex to make the reader want to read more.  It's a bit of manipulation that doesn't feel natural to the story, so it's just irritating.  The one part I really was looking forward to- her witchcraft- is mostly absent because she doesn't WANT to be a witch and so refuses to learn to use her powers.  Well, what fun is that?  None.  I started to get suspicious toward the end that there was going to be a sequel because the story was moving way too slow for there to be a possibility for a wrap-up at the end, and I was right.  But I didn't like the book enough to care to read further.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was really fun and simple to play! I liked that  there were more than 100 games to choose from
B0028NSE3M|5.0|Always Isaac! I overheard this record being played in a record store ( guess that dates me) and I couldn't move!  As soon as the people checked out, I asked the owner what was that record and I bought it immediately.  I was a lowly college student with a limited budget but it was worth it. I bought the album, then the cassette  then the CD. This is replacing the original CD! Needless to say Isaac Hayes rules!
1442346272|4.0|I really like the unabridged version of the audio book, recently listened on a drive from Virginia to Massachussets, and back - I bought this item separately at Costco, because after I ordered on Amazon, I first got a \\"your item has shipped\\" notification from the seller, but then received a notification that due to the lack of quick payment guarantee from Amazon to the seller, the seller was cancelling my order.  My credit card was charged the day I confirmed the order, but then refunded a week later.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great way to pass time.  and I like the option of winning deals, able to change cards and games is cool too
B002VECM4K|5.0|Product shipped was received as ordered. Excellent, fast service without delays!![[ASIN:B004A8ZWVK The Help]].  Also a great movie, I could watch this over and over!
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, would watch it again, and would recommend it.  Liked the way it followed the stories of the different women/maids.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Pigs are cool to slaughter but those nasty monkeys that laugh at ya are plain irritating. You just can't wait to kill them with the launching of the birds!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|seriously. the point system sucks. I wish I could unlock everything in less than 10 freaking years. make the games cost less please!
B0031SCV46|4.0|So far I like this keyboard and would recommend it.  Pros: Keys feel good. Drum pads feel good and are responsive.  Cons: Power supply is not included!!! Knobs are not totally smooth. Direct link is a bit confusing: It's not quite plug and play like the marketing folks say on the box. You have to do an optional install depending on your DAW and functionality seems different for each DAW.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love the games there is only a few games I cant get.my sister and everyone who plays on it loves it.
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I didn't realize how much of the good material on this CD set was already released and in my Beach Boys collection.  However, listening to the alternative Good Vibrations takes was almost worth the price alone.  Brian Wilson is a musical genius.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This case is nearly perfect! Light, protective and not bad looking at all. It does everything its supposed to do without all the bulkiness of some of the other cases that I have seen
B000MD9UJC|5.0|Really nice upgrade to the mini-mag lite.  The LED is bright and lasts a long time.  The switch on the bottom is sort of pointless.  I still turn the light on and off by twisting the crown as designed by mag lite.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|i just saw this movie and had to buy it right away. anybody who does not like this movie better go see a psychiatrist.a great great movie.great acting and great everything.thank you and good-bye.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Received these about a week ago and they are absolutely wonderful.  The sound is amazing, the range is awesome, setup was a breeze, and using them has added a whole new dimension to the game (MW3).  No interference problems at all and they sit next to a blue-ray player, xbox360 and a laptop that are all wirelessly internet connected.  Extremely comfortable, I have played for hours without any of the discomfort that I typically feel when using headphones.  In a world of technology that universally pisses me off due to its inability to \\"just work\\", these headphones work right out of the box, and do so perfectly.
B005974CNA|5.0|I'm not going to actually review this album. As an avid Dream Theater fan I don't see the point. If you follow this band you'll pick up almost anything they do. I've done so with several bands over the years however painful it was listening to their new music (Queen being one of them - Play The Game and Hot Space in particular) but hung on. Kansas is another band that still make viable music whenever they get to it, and they still kick ass live. Okay. This DT release may not be as strong as past releases but certainly holds its own. I don't sense any particular piece of the album as standing out with a riff, melody, solo, etc. as on other albums but this is still an excellent collection of music. Yes, I saw all the audition footage before its release and I think Mike Mangini will fit in nicely. His performance live will be the test. I've seen DT live around 10 times or so including the recorded shows \\"Metropolis - Live In NY\\" and the 20th anniversary show at Radio City Music Hall (that one brought tears to my eyes . . . twice!) Generally speaking I feel a band's sound doesn't really change after replacing a drummer, although Alan White replacing Bill Bruford in Yes did give the band a noticeably harder edge. Some may disagree with me. I understand when Peter Criss left Kiss, their new drummer gave them a good kick in the ass but I'm not that big a Kiss fan so I really can't comment. I do believe that Mangini's time on the road with the band will win over fans who are loyal Portnoy followers. I'm looking forward to seeing them perhaps this summer. I'm also under the impression that Mangini laid down his tracks after most or all of the album was already complete. I guess if he had been there from the beginning we would be able to hear hem a little better. So I suspect we'll have to wait for the next release to determine that, won't we? Again, loyal Dream Theater fans - just get this release and stop being so cerebral about it all. They're still my favorite band. Not too shabby for a sixty one year old, eh? Oh, by the way, I think \\"Build Me Up Break Me Down\\" is a killer track.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A plot that grabs you and never lets go.  I haven't cared so much about the characters in I don't remember when.  The world we see is presented in absorbing detail, and what we don't see (what we get hints of) I'm longing to see.  Highest marks for the story.  Low marks for the Kindle formatting: type size changes at various points, and I have to change preferences to compensate (always possible so far, but a pain).
B002JVWQSW|5.0|Love this show and its great to have so many episodes that I can watch whenever I want. If you like Modern Family, collecting all the season DVDs is a must. Fast shipping too.
B005HSL626|4.0|it works fine don't listen to the bad reviews it is awesome get the app. you will not retreat it
B000QTCXIW|5.0|Best Cd she ever released and i hope she continues to make good music and sing some in depth soul music similar to what Adele has released!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|don't listen to the crap and other bad reviews. this is a good app. It works fine on my kindle.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Very easy to use, no worrys, sound is great, lay out is good.  Easy to find songs and albums. Like the player and eq.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun spare time game, easy to play and alot to do, defonately worth the price, haha
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I have always loved this series but on blu-ray it looks amazing!! If you are debating on dvd or blu-ray it is totally worth it to buy the blu-ray version.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game can keep me entertained for hours!! I don't think I could ever get tired of playing it :)
B005Q46HZM|5.0|This is AWESOME!! :) I've been looking for some of these tracks FOREVER, and could either not find them or only get them on vinyl! The sound quailty is great and the track selections are fantastic! A great slice of 80's dance music - plus some rare Rick Astley unreleased tracks as a bonus! Now when will we be getting a second compilation or something from other PWL remixers?? By the way, I know there is a companion book to this, but the liner notes are realy fasinating!... even though you need a magnifying glass to read them! Could the font be any smaller?!...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I'm only rating this to get points. its pretty fun I guess, if you like little arcade game. okay. peace out.
B004IJY4L0|3.0|Sometimes you'll come across an album where you hear one track that grabs you by the bean bag. That was my case with the first track, \\"Genesis\\". It's just an introductory 1.5 minutes little diddy, but I thought that this album was going to continue with that awesomeness. I am disappointed and confused. Track 2 was off to a good start. The vocals on track 3 reminded me of Chad Kroger. Other vocals throughout the album reminded me of pop-rock circa 2000. Then there is straight-up metal on track 13. The beats, the energy, and the instrumentals one some/most of the tracks are great. I'm thinking epic, double dragon, warrior beats. But on the whole, I was pretty disappointed.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Cover does everything it should do, it's protective,attractive, holds the Kindle in place, I am absolutely satisfied with it. It was a little more on the expensive side, but well worth it. It will probably last longer than the Kindle! Also, it arrived  right on schedule, very good experience all around.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good time killer, it can get annoying if you don't like a certain game or when you get stuck but the overall idea is really cool
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After everything they have been through,it is unrealistic to think there would be a happily ever after.  This series of books have been everything i was looking for, wish there were more book... cant wait for the movies!!!
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This is a great buy.... It comes in a nice package that keeps all the DVDs together. Also it shipped very fast... I got my order in a matter of 3 days! Great product if your a Harry potter fan and want the blue ray collection.
B004GYY714|5.0|I give this a 5 star because I love music and this is a great way to find it! plus its FREE!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't been sucked into a book like this in a long time.  I identified with all the characters and really got caught up in the story.  The world was interesting and made me want to explore.  I love the whole series, honestly.  I wish I'd realized there was a way to get all three on my Kindle in one purchase.  My only regret is there wasn't more about her sister, Prim.  I found her interesting.  I wonder if perhaps Ms. Collins will ever write stories from the viewpoints of other districts?  A collection of short stories from each district would be AMAZING.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great app for kindle fire makes is so fun and easy to play I just love when I'm bored I can Puck up my kindle fire and play!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love the reading plans available with this app! it is great to have the morning reminders too. there are many times that the app has an error message and is unavailable.
B004O3YGMC|1.0|application stole my credentials for my mail account and sent spam ads from my mail to all of my contacts  consider your self warned
1419702238|5.0|Diary of a wimpy kid cabin fever is an amazing book. The book is for age 10 and up. A middle schooler name greg heffly<br /> is snow in with his parents his anoying little brother named manny his older brother who is lazy and a hardcore rocker<br /> in a band named loaded diper. As they are being trap in by a massive snow storm greg is hiding from the police because he<br /> \\"accidently vandalized\\" school property. this is a great book for kids.
B0050AV5MW|2.0|I have little negative to say about the writing of these books, but just like others have said, there are serious problems with the Kindle edition. The particular problem that bugs me is the lack of decent copyediting - there are a lot of missing periods in particular, making some sentences really hard to read, and a handful of misspellings. Honestly, how hard is it to hire a proofreader for a few bucks an hour?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is good for a long Limousin ride and has a lot of games. BUT, it has very easy games. Yawning.  I am Mrs. Piggy, and I aprove this message.
0307595579|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this series. A little scary, a lot suspenseful, and new twists around every turn! Lisbeth is such a great character and this is a definite must-read before you see the movie.  I would highly recommend this box set because the books are beautiful and the pages have a great feel. The page edges look worn and it feels like you're reading a book from an old library. This is a GREAT value and I love having this displayed on my shelf.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think this app is fun yet diffulct. intertwining!thanks great apps free,lots of games .....thanks. that is it all I have to say. k thanks by
B004U52VPS|2.0|You have to be a balancing artist with very steady hands to set up the blocks each time. I am an engineer just out of college, and I think the creators could have used a few physics classes before they designed this game. Many of the block setups are physically impossible and I had to modify them a little to account for gravity so that they would stand up. The \\"wooden\\" pieces (actually made out of slick plastic) should have had a little magnet or loosely snapped together or something - it is so hard to get them to *perfectly* balance in the specified precarious positions correctly.  Finally once the pieces are put together the game is pretty fun trying to knock it down with the birds, but the time setting it up compared to the time actually playing the game is absurd. Literally it could take 5 minutes to set up the pieces, and then 10 seconds to play with the birds.  Definitely NOT for children - I don't know how they would be able to set up the pieces correctly.
0439023521|5.0|Engaging from the very first chapter, I was transported to a time where caste systems, separatism of the masses, and food was used to develop a submissive society and deny freedom on all levels.  The book was fast paced and although sometimes predicatable was oftentimes totally unpredictable.  Must Read.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Thanks to my young niece and nephews, I was introduced to the animated movie HOW TO TRAIN YOUR DRAGON and enjoyed it as much as they did.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it to be delightfully clever with witty, endearing characters.  The music soundtrack is always such an important element, it can often make or break a movie.  In this case, this excellent musical production has merged with an already-wonderful animated production to create an extraordinary work.  If I had heard the music without ever seeing the movie, I would still have bought the CD because I love the beautiful Celtic flavor woven in between energetic, toe-tapping segments and dramatic crescendos that spark the imagination.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app on my Fire.  Loaded very easily and there are a ton of translations to choose from. This app makes it easy to study your Bible daily.
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this little app, actually seems more accurate then local forecasters, ahahah no complaints, runs on my kindle fire just fine.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Don't get the upgrade if you've already unlocked a good amount of the games because all of your progress will be erased. Other than that, pretty entertaining game. Great for when you're bored and have nothing else to do.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I love this book. Emma did it again! Very well written and makes you think about how lucky you are in life.
B005HSL626|5.0|watch out annoying orange! this game allows you to slice many fruits using various backgrounds and swords, as boring as I make it sound try it! it's the best game ever t exist and it's a classic.
B006JD48NM|5.0|I went to my first Formula 1 race at Watkins Glen in 1972 and have been following it since then.  During the mid 80's until '93, I preferred Prost and Mansell but always respected Senna. I have always been surprised at how distraught I was watching that crash.  Berger had a massive shunt and was trapped for 16 seconds in a huge ball of flame at Tamburello in '89 and he missed just one race. Senna had a relatively tame shunt at the same corner and died.  Senna the movie demands a visceral reaction just as the man himself did. (Does anybody know when the blu-ray for region A {North America} will be released?)
1419702238|5.0|This book is definatly worth reading. Personally I think that it is aimed at boys but I am sure girls would love it too! it is quite humerous and I laughed on almost every page.(I couldn't put it down!)  In Addition to that the animated illustrations are amazing! They are on every page and they attract your attention straight away. I think that is aimed at ages 8 to 11 because it is quite easy to read and makes you laugh a lot!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With multiple translations and easy facility to search, create highlights, bookmarks, labels and notes, this application makes for a great source of reference to personal recollections as well as for following along with sermons and other readings demanding rapid flow through various Bible passages.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I saw a lot of negative reviews for this product after I ordered it, and had second thoughts. Now all I can think is, \\"What were these people expecting?\\". It is a fine product that does exactly what you'd want it to; it protects your Fire and it has the convenient folding stand in the back. I am befuddled by what the people who gave it low marks were exactly looking for? It is a case that does its job well; it protects, has a stand that works well and is elegant without looking gaudy. If you want a solid case that works as stated and looks like a professional owns it, then I would suggest getting this one.
B006SV2LWA|5.0|This movie was amazing... the events that unfolded were scientifically accurate.  Some of the science in the movie is over the heads of 95% of the general public, but they can still get the big picture.  I believe anyone who gave this movie less than 4 stars just doesn't understand it, and how absolutely accurate is the timeline and science of the virology and research.
B005OK722U|3.0|Did not pick up where hostel 2 left off. Takes place in Vegas, some surprises but predictable on the common sense level of good vs evil, love always wins. One scene is imaginative but highly unlikely to accompliswh medically. Quentin had nothing to do with it so expect a cheap camera scene by scene without the mysterious flowing motion of the first two. This one the characters are superficial without the depth of innocense and they got what they deserved of the first two. I still suggest seeing it because it will keep you entertained anyway!
0545265355|5.0|I originally ordered this set for a Christmas gift for a friend, but after receiving the package I had to order another one for myself.  The stories are phenomonal and the packaging and quality of the product was great.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun tto play to kill time! some games are impossible but most are fun and I wish it wasn't so hard to unlock. new.games
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Wonderful!!! I'm an avid Big Bang Theory watcher. I love the show and most of its characters. The season comes well packaged and protected. The case is very slim, with each disc on its own holder. And it's easy to watch on your computer. I'm sure it works just as well with a DVD player, but since I only can watch it on my laptop that's what I did. I would recommend this to anyone whose starting their own Big Bang Theory collection. I bought this season specifically since I had the rest on my computer. It would also make a wonderful gift to anyone who enjoys the show as well.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|The acting is very good.  It is one of the good ones to watch It does hold your interest.  Even the kids and teenagers would enjoy it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this cover! Fits the kindle Fire perfectly. Great protection, and is very easy to use and clean.
B0015AARJI|1.0|Ordered from A&One, I received a fake controller. The label reads Sony ComputerEnter Tainment inc.<br />Also the controls are stiff and the battery doesnt last long.
1615243496|5.0|The story of FRANKENSTEIN is a tale that never seems to go away or get tiresome because it is a true literary classic that addresses fundamental questions about who we are, what we are capable of and how our choices generate enormous consequences. This beautiful 'INTERVISUAL BOOKS' leather-bound edition of the much-published adventure of the mad scientist who creates a new being out of pieces of dead beings is worth picking up and reading, even if you have a copy already or have read the story before. And if you haven't, you are in for a real treat. Not only is the story wonderfully inspired, the background about how it came to be written by Mary Shelley (wife of the much-loved poet; Percy Bysshe Shelley) is equally compelling. And the writing style of that period (1818) is like a time machine that takes you back to the period where the story is set. The book was first published under the title 'THE MODERN PROMETHEUS'.
1597771007|4.0|If you enjoy the long and detailed writing of a British novel, this book is for you. Brioney Tallis is a 13 year old in 1935, when she witnesses her older sister, Cecilia, in an encounter with, Robby, the son of their house maid. In her innocence, Briony is shocked and believes Robby has assulted her sister, whom she decides to protect at all costs. Later that evening her teenage cousin is assulted and Brioney is convinced it was Robby. Through the arrest and trial, Briony stands by her story, although a small voice reminds her she did not actually see Robby attack her cousin. The story than turns to Robby, now out of prison, fighting in WWII. A graphic and emotional representation of the horrors of war and its impact on soldiers and citizens is well written. The story now turns back to an adult Nurse Brioney, working in war torn England. Over the years she has come to realize who the true attacker was and her need to be truthful with all involved - although too late to undo the conviction and damage that has ensued. Each character is well written in this intriguing story, however, the ending seemed to run out of steam and was somewhat of a let down
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Perfect cover for Kindle Fire.  Light weight, sturdy, stays shut with attached elastic band.  Nothing about it seems flimsy or fragile.  Well made product that I would definitely purchase again.  I've had for over a month & no complaints.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love it, its pretty, the detail is great, the straps hold my Fire in place and it even has a little pocket, I love it for hands-free listening, movies and reading when Im on my lunch!
0765356147|5.0|This was a very satisfying trilogy to read.  Each book was excellent - advancing the story for all the characters through a variety of twists and the ending brought everything together.  So often authors try to continue sagas that should end after 3 books - maybe they are unsure how to tie everything together for an ending that is satisfying to the readers who have invested so much in the story and characters.  I believe that Sanderson accomplished this difficult task with the Mistborn Trilogy.  Now that I am finished reading the books I will miss Vin, Elend, Sazed, TenSoon, Spook and the others but the ending left me with a smile on my face.
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|This was a great movie. The 3D was nice and the case alone was nice. Came on time, im very pleased.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a Godsent app for your phones and tablets! It's wonderful for Bible study. Although, I still recommend having a actual Bible. Some tablets require a wifi setting, therefor you wont be able to access this app. But most churches don't have wifi access anyway which is why you should still carry your Bible. And going back to the quality of the app, it is sophisticated, smart, fun, And easy to use which is important kn
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|Perfect. Need I say more? Rooney Mara deserves the Oscar for this movie. She did so wonderful in the role. Do yourselves a favor and put aside 2 hours and 38 minutes to watch this masterpiece. Thank you. ;)
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Kindle fire fits well into the case. Like the texture. The part that I don't care for is the fuzzy felt inside that faces the screen. Collects lots of dust and hair. Might be better to have a neoprene like material. The back needs to bend in a few more places to give you more options to adjust.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this case for my Kindle Fire. It is light weight and very tough. I travel a lot so I've used the stand feature of the case quite a few times. I don't have the problems that others have in it malfunctioning in turbulence. For the majority of a one and a half hour flight we experienced light chop/turbulence and the case held up perfectly. I really like how the case doesn't make the device bulky. It fits perfectly around my Kindle and keeps it well protected. For the price, you can't go wrong with this case. I've seen sleeves sold at Best Buy for the same amount and have only one feature to it, which is put your Kindle in this bag and that's the only time it's protected. Once it's out who knows what can happen. I'm very happy with my purchase.
B002ZG997C|5.0|It makes you think how important the BIBLE is and how in many places in the middle east they cannot even get caught with one in the year 2012! How precious it is...and what job we all must fullfill before death.  This movie does make you contemplate it, especially if you read the BIBLE, and the end of the movie is ironic.
1451648537|3.0|While I found the overall story of Jobs' life to be extremely fascinating I was not a fan of how this particular book was written.  Rather than taking a linear approach to his life, the author often jumped back and forth from this year to that year to another year.  I found this distracting as it made me to stop to think about what stage of Jobs' life we were in during that time frame, what he had accomplished, what challenges he was facing, what group of people were in his life?  Perhaps this non-linear approach is common in biographies and I just don't read enough of them.  Regardless, I wasn't a fan of it.<br /><br />There also appear to be some strange commissions such as when Steve actually passed away, where he was, who was with him, etc.  Or when his father, Paul, passed away and how Steve reacted to it.  There was also no mention of Steve moving on from Pixar.  Was he CEO of that company until his death?  Did he step down when the company was sold to Disney? Perhaps the last two omissions were actually present in the book but I missed them somehow.  I'm left searching other books or wikipedia to find answers to the questions this biography left me with thus defeating the purpose of purchasing the biography to begin with.
0199601348|5.0|This is definitely a first-rate brief introduction to ancient Greece by one of the more famous and talented historians presently working in this genre. I highly recomend the book for those who don't know much about the subject.
0143119680|5.0|I enjoyed this book so much that less than a week after finishing it, I re-read it and picked up on a lot of details I missed the first time.  Once you can get your head around all the alchemy and DNA portions it is a wonderful book!  I do understand the frustration one reviewer posted about none of the conflicts coming to an end, unlike the Harry Potter series, where some life or death matter was resolved in each book and at the same time the entire story line contributed to the next book.  Still, for me, it was an incredibly interesting read and I hate the thought of waiting until July to read the next book.  And even worse, waiting an interminably long, painful, excruciating amount of time for book 3.

B006T5FDLG|5.0|I heard the four tracks on this EP online when they were released individually a couple months ago, and now it's nice to have them on CD since they're good songs, and since I'm not into iPods.  Some of them, especially my favorite, Just a Bullet Away, probably could've replaced tracks that made it onto Death Magnetic.  Metallica might be aging, but they still have some fire left, as they showed when they played these songs live during their 30th Anniversary gigs in San Francisco.  Similar to the other songs from the Death Magnetic sessions, the four tracks here show off plenty of metal riffs and solos, with equal portions of Black Album-style heavy rock.  Here's a more detailed account of each track for anyone interested.<br /><br />Hate Train--The first half of this song features riffs very similar to Fuel and Black Album-era verses, with the second half sounding more like their thrash era.  It has some slow parts with decent singing by James, but some of the first half might have sounded too close to Fuel to make Death Magnetic.  The solos could be longer, but this song is definitely heavy on riffs and has a lot of different sections.  Despite the Fuel riffs, I think it sounds less like the Re-Load era than several songs from DM.<br /><br />Just a Bullet Away--Awesome metal song, with great riffs, lyrics, and vocals...this one definitely should've been on Death Magnetic.  It seems to be most people's favorite of the four, although Rebel of Babylon gets a lot of votes, too.  I think it would fit nicely on the Black Album, as it's sort of an almost-thrash song that would sound at home with the heaviest few tracks from that release.<br /><br />Hell and Back--The strange song out of the four.  It reminds me of Broken, Beat, & Scarred in some parts, and Cyanide in others.  The weird verses in the first half don't remind me of anything from Metallica.  They're almost alternative, I guess; not bad, really, just different.  It gets fairly heavy in the middle, then continues with some nice riffs until the end.  Even though it might be the weakest of the four tracks, it's still good enough for a solid 4 out of 5.<br /><br />Rebel of Babylon--This is another clearly heavy song like Just a Bullet Away, with some fast riffing in the verses.  James offers a few vocal lines that get about as old-school as he can manage these days.  There's still a lot more singing than in the old days, but you hear traces of that gruff, harsh James of the past.  It leaves a nice taste finishing things off heavy.<br /><br />Listening to the songs on this EP, I could make the case that some are about equal to tracks on Death Magnetic, so I can see where Metallica might have had a tough time deciding which ones to leave off that album.  Just a Bullet Away is the only one that I'd gladly sacrifice a song for (maybe Cyanide), but just adding them to Death Magnetic would've made it too long in my opinion.  Which makes it cool that they put them together for an EP to hold us off until a new album comes together.  Clocking in at about a half hour with four 7-8 minute songs, Beyond Magnetic is a fine EP to add to Metallica's discography.  Easily worth the $5 price tag.es with some nice riffs until the end.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I have tried a couple of solitaire apps and this one is better. you can Tao cards to get them to move or you can drag them. It will also deal a random game or a winning game. winning games are fun because you can then compare your time to the top recorded times. Quite a few options for a free app.

B0060AY6FO|1.0|It amazes me how publishers are willing to print just about anything written by a best selling author. And apparently, in the case of Death Comes to Pemberley, without even bothering to edit it. Although I am not sure that an editor could have saved this silly piece of something, I would have felt better if they had tried.  The professional critics also amazed me, and made me long to get my hands on a copy of the book they were reading, because I did not recognize this one in the reviews at the New York Times, the Washington Post, Wall Street Journal and the LA Times. I found little to praise and much to bemoan. What they may not have noticed is that had an editor been found to cut so much of the repetition and pointless exposition this book could possibly have become a charming novella and homage to Jane Austen. It could not have gotten any worse. As it stands now, it is difficult to read and even more difficult to believe.  Starting with Elizabeth Darcy nee Bennet. What happened to the overly confident, intelligent, insightful heroine who found \\"delight in the absurd\\"? How did she become the woman who meekly stood by and allowed the housekeeper to order her about in the presence of her guests as if she were Daphne du Maurier's unnamed narrator in Rebecca?  \\"I will sit with Mrs. Wickham until Dr. McFee arrives, madam. I expect he will give her something to calm her and make her sleep. I suggest that you and Mrs. Bingley go back to the music room to wait; you will be comfortable there and the fire has been made up. Stoughton will stay at the door and keep watch, and he will let you and Mrs. Bingley know as soon as the chaise comes into sight. And if Mr. Wickham and Captain Denny are discovered on the road, there will be room in the chaise for the whole party, although it will not perhaps be the most comfortable of journeys. I expect the gentlemen will need something hot to eat when they do return, but I doubt, madam, whether Mr. Wickham and Captain Denny will wish to stay for refreshments. Once Mr. Wickham knows that his wife is safe, he and his friend will surely want to continue their journey. I think Pratt said that they were on their way to the King's Arms at Lambton.\\"  This is simply wrong. Jane Austen's Elizabeth Bennet would have been telling the housekeeper what she wanted done and how she wanted it done. She had been Mrs. Darcy for six years, surely a woman of Elizabeth's intelligence would have learned how to order a household by now and would not have tolerated being treated like a child. The character created by PD James wonders if the housekeeper \\"was being deliberately reassuring.\\" Who is this person with Elizabeth Darcy's name? She appears as nothing but a foil for the others and is perhaps the most passive character in the novel.  On the morning after a dead body is found in the woods of Pemberley, Darcy and Elizabeth both feel the need to address the servants. PD James apparently thinks it is important for us to know this and to remember it as she repeats it four or five times, even including it twice in the same paragraph:  \\"...love, I think it is time for us to speak to the staff, both the indoor servants and those who may be working in the house. Mrs. Reynolds and Stoughton will have told them only that there has been an accident and the ball has been cancelled, and there will be considerable alarm and anxiety. I will ring for Mrs. Reynolds now and say that we will come down to speak to them in the servants' hall ...\\"  Why not just go down and speak to them? The long heralded \\"talk\\" reveals nothing that has not already been discussed and provides no illumination of either the characters or the action. The elevation of mundane information is repeated throughout the novel, seemingly without reason.  Like the candles. Yes, candles. The body of Capt. Denny is placed on the table of the gunroom. When the authorities arrive at Pemberley, they are taken to view it. But first we must detour into a discussion of candles. Three pages of talk about how many candles they need, what kind of candles they are, how many are already in the gunroom (fourteen, we are told) and if the use of dining room candles will upset the housekeeper and the butler (?!?). I wondered whether the number and type of candles was a red herring placed in the path of the solution to the mystery or if it was simply James' way of reminding us ignorant readers of the the 21st century that they had no electricity in 1803. I believe it to be the later. Or perhaps she had a minimum word quota to meet.  This repetition continues throughout the novel, as scenes and activities are described by multiple characters with minor differences between the accounts. Testimony given to the magistrate is repeated at the inquest, and then again at the trial. Really, we need to hear three times that the horses did not want to enter the woods?  And there is way too much of the amateurish \\"do remind me\\" and \\"do you remember when\\" manner of adding details from the original Pride & Prejudice to this story. As if anyone other than a die-hard Jane Austen fan would be reading Death Comes to Pemberley. And if someone was unfamiliar with that novel, these trips down memory lane would hardly enlighten them. Either way, it would cause the action to slow, if there was any action to speak of. Which there really isn't.  The mystery itself is surprisingly weak, especially coming from PD James. Much as I love mysteries, I don't like being able to figure them out in the first few chapters.  If you love Jane Austen's people and their stories, read her books. They are free to download from multiple sources.
B006OT03BM|5.0|Just recieved this item via ups. The box itself is very impressive and the packing it was in was very protective. Note: Be very careful when removing the tape over the Blu ray discs that the manufacturer put on. On the first transformers movie it did peel some of the disc top layer off but I had read on forums that this should not affect the play back. If that is the case I'm jumping for joy! Michael Bay and his team did a great job putting this collectors box set together and reccomend it to everyone young and old!
B004SBX112|5.0|Awesome fun. Have never seen an ad in the game like the Ad version that is available  on the Market. Only ads are the standard Rovio ads you see at the pause screen.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|The scripe was maybe 5 pages long. The movie consisted of ppl staring, and close ups of ppl staring. Some good driving, nothing noteworthy, nothing memorable other then a really bad ending. There wasn't enough story or dialogue to comment on the acting. Overall the movie had no point, the plot was barely recognizeable, it left this critic feeling like the main character, may have been mentally challanged. Rent this movie, do not buy.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I don't know if Edward De Vere (Rhys Ifans), Earl of Oxford, wrote the plays and sonnets credited to William Shakespeare or not.  Nor do I know if Queen Elizabeth I gave birth to illegitimate children.<br /><br />What I do know is that ANONYMOUS is a fascinating, totally engrossing motion picture; a revisionist history, part political thriller, that provides a possible answer to one of the world's great mysteries.<br /><br />Directed by Roland Emmerich, John Orloff's script seamlessly moves back-and-forth between several time periods, as it recounts the tale of a nobleman of questionable birth who writes magnificent plays and sonnets, yet because of the political environment of the era, must let another takes credit for them.  Much of the drama centers on court intrigues involving Elizabeth, brilliantly portrayed in her later years by Vanessa Redgrave and, as a younger woman, by Redgrave's daughter, Joely Richardson.<br /><br />I am not going to divulge specific plot details, because that would make me a spoiler and this saga has too many deliciously intriguing twists-and-turns that a viewer should discover for himself.<br /><br />The entire cast, which includes David Thewlis (as the nefarious Robert Cecil), Jamie Campbell Bower (as the younger Edward De Vere) and Derek Jacobi, who bookends the story as sort of a narrator, are magnificent.<br /><br />ANONYMOUS, which has received an Oscar nomination for Best Costume Design, uses CGI to craft an astounding recreation of Elizabethan England.<br /><br />Extras on the DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment include audio commentary with Emmerich and Orloff, deleted scenes and a featurette, \\"Who Is the Real William Shakespeare?\\".<br /><br />© Michael B.

B004SIP7F8|2.0|SPOILER ALERT: This review contains a major plot revelation that must be mentioned in order to explain the major flaw in this movie.  This movie looks exquisite, with a dynamite cast and is well plotted.  All the things that explain why it is widely praised.  Unfortunately, like Forest Gump (see my review), this movie is profoundly undermined by a perversion of morality.  At the end of Casablanca, Rick says to Ilsa something to the effect of:  \\"I'm no good at being noble, but it doesn't take much to see that the problems of three little people don't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.\\" That \\"crazy world\\" being Europe on the verge of being made a permanent part of the Nazi empire.  This movie turns that position on its head.  Here, again, the protagonist is faced with a dilemma of deciding between his one true love and protecting his country from the Nazis  - only his dilemma is even clearer because the choice is between disclosing important intelligence to the Nazis for an opportunity to search for a woman who is almost certainly dead. Given the title of my review, you can guess what he did \\"for love.\\"  Yet the audience is manipulated into weeping for this man rather than despising him. If you've not seen this movie, skip it. Stick with Casablanca and be reminded that, in times of crisis, a true adult is ennobled by love.

0446547654|5.0|True to form, Nicholas Sparks lets his genius flow through the pages of The Best of Me. Relationships run the gammut from beautiful to tragic, from easy to complicated, from normal to extraordinary. The cast of characters makes themselves part of your family and you'll be anxious to finish the book, yet yearning for it to have no ending.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I purchased this amplifier for use with my trusty old pair of Sony MDR-CD780 headphones and Xitel Minilink USB audio adapter. The Xitel isn't powerful enough to drive the headphones without an amplifier, but with the addition of the Fiio I am getting excellent sound. I didn't actually need a portable solution, but the unit is so small and light and includes a little hook on the corner which should make it easy to fasten to a clip of some kind, and given how good it sounds I might actually want to start carrying it around with me when I want to listen to music on the go.<br /><br />Meanwhile even though I used two day shipping I was pleasantly surprised to find that the unit arrived less than 24 hours after I had ordered it. Given how inexpensive it is I can wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone looking for a simple headphone amplifier. The only downsides are that the physical interface is somewhat unintuitive - it has multiple LEDs, one to indicate charing and another to indicate the current EQ status, and you have to turn the unit on by holding the slider switch for a couple of seconds; the same switch is also used to cycle through EQ settings. It is trivial to use if you actually read the product documentation (which itself is a bit confusing) but I did have to go fish the insert out of the trash to learn these things when I wasn't getting any sound after setting it up.

B005KJJ4F8|4.0|I thought this book was great.  I read a lot and it is rare to find truly unique concepts that work.  The retelling of Cinderella with a cyborg heroine mechanic is just brilliant.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the characters, especially that of Cinder and I was also thrilled that, while there was a love story of sorts, it wasn't the typically YA \\"true love at first sight that transcends everything.\\"<br /><br />The big reveal at the end was completely obvious, but given the number of hints towards it during the story, I assume the author intended it to be that way.  Even though it was obvious, it still worked as the end for this book and I am definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series.

With all the changes in horror like improved special effects and the point that I've seen it well over forty time its more comedic now a days.<br /><br />This is one of Bruces best.  The acting is decent considering the type of movie although their are so e cheesy lines such as \\"groovy\\" after Bruce has finished attaching a chai saw to his wrist bei g he had to cut off his possessed hand.<br /><br />Watch this for a few cheap scares at what horror use to be and even more laughs.
B0068RHGJM|3.0|Imaginaerum is not like Wishmaster, Once, or Century Child.  This cd is much queiter.  This is not a widely diverging cd like Dark Passion Play.  This is a tightly themed well done cd.  However, it is closer to folk and soft rock then metal.  I love it but it is not what I was expecting.  This is not a cd I can sing along with in the car.

I've had this album on autorepeat for about five hour now and am loving it.<br /><br />Not every song is great, there are a couple of, if not exactly losers exactly, certainly not winners among the playlist, but most of of the songs are very good.<br /><br />Thing is, I think you need the right mind-set for this stuff.  It's languid, laid back, angsty, self indulgent, drowsy, sexy, smoke-filled music that very often strikes a singularly perfect note.<br /><br />To her packagers (if there are any) all I can say is - \\"Well played, my friends, and keep it up.\\"

B004132HZS|5.0|I've been a fan of Sherlock Holmes since childhood, growing up with Jeremy Brett and Edward Hardwicke (my preferred Watson) as the perfect dramatization of the stories. That was until I saw the first three episodes of Sherlock. To say that I was hesitant with the modernization of Holmes is an understatement, especially after the utter bastardization by Downey and Law - fine actors in their own right, but not for Holmes nor Watson.<br /><br />After watching a well matched Cumberbatch and Freeman in a modern day setting, I realized that they will be bringing a new generation into the fold of Sherlock Holmes fans, and rightfully so. The story writing is superb, capturing the essence of both characters but adding modernity to each. Many Holmes fan will find several inside jokes about some of the theories about Holmes and Watson's relationship.<br /><br />The writers don't miss a beat. Oh, one of the writers plays Sherlock's older brother, Mycroft. You really can't go wrong if you enjoy, mystery dramas, intelligent characters, or if you are true-blue Holmes fan. Definitely check it out!! Oh, season 2 is even better!

B003Y5H53S|5.0|I recieved this movie in an order with a few other items I purchased. I have come to find you can never go wrong with Amazon. This movie is absolutely brilliant. I am a hardcore movie critic and rarely will buy a movie, I only do when I know it is one I will want to have in my collection of favorites. This is a must watch! It makes you smile, makes you laugh, and the special effects and the emotions on the cartoons faces are so realistic and creative. Like I said in my title for the review, this is a movie for all ages that you can watch again and again! Thanks for the good price and fast shipping Amazon!!
B005NPLXJ4|3.0|You know, I am tired of the Metallica fans whining about how bad this album sounds to them.  For the last time, this was not meant to be a Metallica record!  This wa a little side project that both these guys (Metallica & Lou Reed) decided to do because they thought it was cool and edgy.  If this is not your bag of tricks, they don't seem to care.  There in lies the problem.  Metallica should not have put their name on this album, as it is inevitably going to be compared to their standard music genre and not be looked at as stand alone.  If you want to give this a chance, put on a pair of headphones, sit back and take in all 19 minutes plus of Junior Dad.  It is a sonic treat more reminisent of a pre-Dark Side of the Moon Pink Floyd track.  Like I said, it isn't for everyone, but if you put the \\"Metallica\\" thing away and listen to that track, you just might enjoy it for what it is.
0738711500|5.0|I bought these for my 16 year old sister who has drawn interest in my Tarot cards previously. I have been using Tarot for years and I use these often now, the artwork is beautiful! The book explains everything you need to know for a Tarot reading, preparing you card deck, using a crystle with your cards, etc. The meaning of the cards are very in depth and easily explainable. At this price, you can not go wrong. This is something I will be proud of buying her for her birthday she loved it and so do I. The name of the product fits the description well. Thanks Amazon!

B004NSULHM|2.0|Before this album was released I pretty much liked everything done by Radiohead - to say the least.<br />King of Limbs however turns out to be their first album I really don't like much at all.<br />I'm surprised that so many people believe the album is an absolute masterpiece. It's different alright but not much of it actually stands out.<br />Give Up The Ghost is clearly more than just a good song and the absolute gem on this release.<br />Codex and Separator are very listenable as well.<br />So, all in all King Of Limbs -I'm sorry to say- not particularly recommended, but give it a listen by all means. If you like the first song, you might like this album nonetheless.<br />(adjusted 3/2/2013)

0312323867|5.0|I have since deleted my review of &#34;Something Borrowed&#34; because it was quite... impassioned. I really didn't like it. In fact, I hated it. We'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Don't ask me what possessed me to read &#34;Something Blue.&#34; I think I bought them together and I had the book so I figured I might as well read it. Maybe it was because I knew John Krasinski's character in the movie was the leading man. I don't know.<br /><br />After the atrocity that was &#34;Something Borrowed,&#34; I didn't expect to like &#34;Something Blue.&#34; But Emily Giffin totally changed my mind about her and her writing. I adored &#34;Something Blue.&#34; Yes, Darcy is self-centered and a little clueless. Not exactly your classic heroine. But at least she had personality, unlike someone I know... (Rachel). Ethan is funny, charismatic, kind. The kind of leading male you want in a novel, unlike someone I know... (Dex).<br /><br />I can't say exactly what it was that I really liked about &#34;Something Blue.&#34; But I think I enjoyed seeing Darcy grow up and evolve as a person. I think the love story between Darcy and Ethan was believable. We saw what they went through together and we saw them change together and fall in love. Whereas Dex and Rachel have sex in the first book and then decide to have more sex and they just say, &#34;Okay. We're in love.&#34; It was very believable for Darcy and Ethan. Ethan didn't like her all that much at first, but he helped her like a good friend (and romantic male lead) should, and he helped her grow up for herself and her children.<br /><br />Overall, the relationships were developed well. Darcy is a GOOD female lead because she grows and learns something by the end. Ethan is a GOOD male lead because he's funny and charming and charismatic and nice. They're both everything Rachel and Dex weren't. The book was cute and enjoyable chick lit. A book where you can root for the heroine. I'd tell everyone to skip &#34;Something Borrowed&#34; and just read &#34;Something Blue.&#34; There's enough explanation where you can follow the story without reading the garbage &#34;Something Borrowed&#34; was. Make THIS into a movie. John Krasinski deserves to be the leading male instead of just the guy in the background. Great book.There's enough explanation where you can follow the story without reading the garbage &#34;Something Borrowed&#34; was. Make THIS into a movie.

B004V2AWKG|5.0|I have been reading the book called The Giver for a while now. At first it was an odd topic and it made no sense to me. Then as I kept reading the story got intense and I did not want to stop reading it. I think this book is a really good book. The story is about a boy named Jonas living in a world of rules he gets assigned a role in his community but if I told you it I would ruin the story. The writer Lois Lowry is very good making you feel like you are actually there.  I don't think I would change anything in this book if I were asked to because it is just wonderful! I personally like reading fantasy but, I think this book changed my mind about Science Fiction because I have never felt like I wanted to keep reading a science fiction ever but this book is so exciting! I recommend this book to 6th-8th graders; it is great but may be a little too intense for 6th grade and under.
0743270754|5.0|This is probably the best overall look at Lincoln in respect to the 1860 presidential election and his presidency. It goes into vivid detail about the men he was running against, their beliefs, their backgrounds, and their platforms. It also describes their strengths and weaknesses and delves into how possibly the least likely candidate Abraham Lincoln earned the nomination.<br />This book is very well-written which is amazing considering how far reaching this story is. Aside from just profiling all the candidates, which in itself could be confusing, it goes into exacting detail. It could be a little dicey keeping the issues and the candidates straight, but Kearns manages to create order out of possible chaos.<br />The biggest draw is that this book is very readable. Instead of reading like a history, the treatment here is more like a novel. History comes alive, it is interesting, involving, and gives the reader the sense that they are there.<br />One of the major points I extracted from this book is Lincoln's ability to recognize the strengths of his rivals and learn how to work with them as his closest advisors. I suspect this adds a new dimension to the adage of keeping your friends close, but your enemies closer. Ultimately though, it comes down to pooling resources and working for the common good of the people in trying times.<br />While a long and sometimes complex book, I loved it. It was a wonderful trip back in time.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|Based on the Third Seville War, the original Starz series Spartacus: Blood and Sand wonderfully brings to life the legend of Spartacus (Andy Whitfield) and the slave uprising that began in a Capuan ludus owned by Lentulus Batiatus (John Hannah).<br /><br />What makes Spartacus so great is the balance.  For the male audience there is an obscene amount of blood, battle, fighting and killing.  And when swords aren't stabbing organs, the male stars of the show are organ stabbing.  Think of it as a slightly pornographic 300.  Sounds just for the men, right?  Well, rest assured, the women viewers will be pleased both by the ample display of male physique, but also an amazingly complex storyline where women are often the power-brokers.  There really isn't a single character that doesn't have a subplot.<br /><br />The acting is superb in all facets.  Whitfield has sadly passed, but fans of the series will remember him fondly.  Supporting actors provide their talent in heaps.  Alongside Hannah in the Batiatus household is his wife Lucretia, played with a commanding presence by Lucy Lawless.  Manu Bennett is powerful and easily portrays a Gaul warrior capable of defeating numerous opponents in gladiator arenas.  My favorite, however, is Peter Mensah as Doctore.  Mensah is ominous and powerful, a man who must draw stares whenever he enters the room.<br /><br />The one flaw, other than overlookable historical embellishments, is the early series FX that bordered on absurd.  Luckily this waned as the first season progressed, and improved considerably towards the end.  There are times when the language is so over the top it's repetitious and irksome, but for the most part it's engaging.<br /><br />Great sword and sandal (sword and sex?) series, maybe the best overall series on TV.
0553801473|4.0|Ok, I just finished DwD and I wanted to share my thoughts. But before I do, a little background info:<br />I started with the HBO series and was just awestruck by it. After watching all ten episodes on HBOGo(in 3 days!) I knew I had to read the books,like yesterday. I am not a fan of fantasy novels and less so of series which require so much of its readers. Regardless I jumped in head first. I started GoT a month ago and much to the horror of my husband and kids, didn't come up for air until I had finished DwD.<br /> I have read the reviews and while I understand why some people wouldn't like the pace as much as the other books I have to say that I was not disappointed. Yes its slower and YES I heeded the warnings and skipped most of Dany's chapters as well as large portions of Tyrion's.<br /> Im still giving this book 4 stars. I wont go into a detailed review as there are fans who have done that, and better than I could. I just want to say that if youre invested in the series, you will be doing yourself a disservice by skipping this. GRRM hasn't let us down only changed our course a bit.<br /> There were some slow parts, granted. But the story. Oh the story! Im still lost in the world he created, still rooting for Dany,Tyrion, the remaining Starks and my sweet hero Jon Snow(or whoever he may actually be). Im also rooting for characters I had long written off as unlikable or worse. I believe in GRRM and Im just as engrossed with ASOIF as ever.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|king engages you from the very first page. i think i read the entire book with my eyes wide open. i love the paradoxical possibilities and alternate realities time travel creates. this book did not disappoint. probably one of the most satisfying endings despite leaving me longing for more for jake.
0719524520|1.0|I had heard so many wonderful things about \\"Sarah's Key\\" and was very excited to read it.  Sadly, the book was a complete disappointment.  The writing style is simplistic and filled with too many questions that beg answers that are simply not compelling.  I could not relate to the main character Julia Jarmond in the slightest.  She is an obsessive sort who seems to have no rational compass to guide her actions.  She repeatedly did and said things that had no basis that I could relate to.  Julia is flighty and emotional in ways that are simply not interesting. I found her rather pathetic and with a sad world outlook that didn't recognize her own power.  The only reason I slogged through this was for a book club, otherwise I would have put the drivel down after a few chapters.
B0062NAX1U|1.0|Sat down to watch what I thought was a good police movie and instead was made to feel what an inferior father I was because I didn't sign a piece of paper, frame it and hang it on a wall.  I knew something was up with this movie when I see cops sitting around an outdoor table at a b-b-q and no one's got a beer in their hand.  A cop, without a beer?  Yea, that's realistic.  And no cursing?  Puleeeeeezzzzze.  Hey, if you need to get together with your buddies and have a ceremony and sign a piece of paper to be a good father, then I say, \\"whatever it takes\\".  But, most men start doing that the second their child is \\"BORN\\".
B000N6TX1S|1.0|This movie demonstrates what happens when the PCers get their hands on an excellent novel and turn it into an awful movie. The differences between the novel by P. D. James and the movie are enormous and, as far as I can tell, serve the purposes of political correctness and nothing else.  To give three examples: 1) the pregnant woman in the book is a white Anglo-Saxon Anglican (Julian), in the movie a person of color and illegal immigrant (Kee); 2) the baby born in the book is male, in the movie female; 3) the baby in the novel is named after his father, Luke, and the primary character of the story, Theo, two explicitly male gender names, in the movie is given an androgynous name, Dylan.  These three elements are what they are in the novel for religious reasons.  All religious references in the novel are strikingly absent from the movie, hence these three elements are changed.  Because of these changes and several others as well, the movie is confusing, the plot inexplicable, the ending unsatisfactory in the extreme.  (The novel ends with the baptism of the child by Theo.)  Even the fact that children are not being conceived because of the failure of sperm, not eggs, is there for a religious reason.  And the book does suggest why men are incapable of impregnating women--not in scientific terms, of course, but in religious terms, yes.  P. D. James is a superb writer whose work deserves far, far better treatment than this movie.
B004I8WD7S|4.0|This is actually a pretty decent product. Its slick and keeps the iPhone slim which is nice. The only thing I would change is I would add the volume cover and remove the logo circle on the back but overall I like it a lot better than the acase I purshaed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible app I've seen in my life it is so awesome and I use it for church to.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|As a fan of the books, I of course found aspects of this film lacking when compared to their source material (the ultimate showdown between Harry and Voldemort, the way Ginny is portrayed, the casting/treatment of Bill, Fred's battle) but after I saw the movie the first time I realized that instead of finding the errors/issues, I should focus on the movie as a separate entity from the books. WHen I did this, I found my love of the film growing.  The arming of Hogwarts is amazing...so is the battle. Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman give great performances and the progress Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe have made throughout the films is great. Their characters are believeable and honest and so well portrayed. I even liked the epilouge!  While so many fans found things that disappointed them (and I still think the final battle should have been in the great hall in front of everyone) I think it's important to enjoy these films as their own thing.  As far as extras on the BluRay, the conversation between JK Rowling and Daniel Radcliffe is amusing and informative. The feature on the women of Harry Potter is interesting but should have been longer. On the second disc you're only getting about 1 1/2 hours of content, which is a little sad. The movie mode (which allows you watch the film while being interrupted by the cast/crew with tidbits from the making of the series) is interesting, though a lot of the information wasn't new. Also some of the deleted scenes were put into the movie in this mode which was interesting but also annoying because they hadn't been finished in terms of special effects.  I know at some point another version of all of these films will be released. And I can only hope for more special feature (or extended versions with completed new scenes added in). ALso I want some commentaries! It would have been so fun to sit listen to the three leads discuss their adventures while making all 8 films.  So watch this and enjoy it for what it is. It's not the book, and it will never be as good as the book. But as a film it is beautiful and moving.
0743497465|3.0|Dan Brown is known for being a conspiracy theorist in his writings and this one is no different. He has a great ability to tell an amazing story that has you unsure of what is fiction and what is reality. In Deception Point, I think he might have gone too far with the conspiracy theorist...he somehow has you guessing at which high ranking political figure is using covert ops to work with NASA to plant a meteorite with life under an iceberg that would then be detected by NASA satellites, and then to cover it all up at whatever costs by chasing down and trying to kill the main characters throughout the book...and all this in an attempt to win an election and save NASA's funding...like I said conspiracy theory gone awry.<br /><br />It is a fun story to read though, but out of Dan Brown's 5 current novels...this would rank 4th, only above Digital Fortress.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|very well done , was`nt sure how `I`d react to this film , but must say I can think of nothing bad to say about it ! those who do are pretentious nitpickers who would`nt know a good film if it crawled up and bit them on the ankle ! to those who complain that it is the same film with different actors , of course it`s very similar ! dont be an idiot ! it`s in the same setting under damned near the same conditions , there will be similarities ! this one is actually closer to the original story than the carpenter film , mainly because we can now show the creature as described in the short story , and novelization of the carpenter film ! if you see this film watch through the credits for the tie in with the 1982 film ! waited a long time for this film , rather happy they did`nt screw it up !!!
1400032717|4.0|My wife and I both read this book after reading many reviews and after my wife taught a child with Aspergers. I personally found the book to be very insightful and I have a new found opinion of those with mental handicaps. The primary character was not normal in the social ways, but was a genius in math and memory. The author did a great job of weaving an interesting story that was able to help the reader into the mind of a teenager with Asperger's (could have been a different condition, but similar at least).  The one complaint my wife and I had was the language. Throughout the book the characters will use many profanities which could have been cleaned up. For us, it made it a little harder to read through, my wife more than me, but more importantly it makes it harder for us to recommend to others we know who could also find the language offensive.  It was still a great story and very insightful for those who want to better understand the thought processes of a friend or relative who may have a similar condition, just be aware of the language going in.

B003VWC4AS|5.0|I saw the movie Invictus before reading the book so I came into it with certain preconceptions, believing this was going to primarily be about a Rugby team that helped unify a nation. This was much more than that...it was about the life of a great leader in Nelson Mandela. I would say that only about a quarter of the book is about the rugby team, and the rest of it about Nelson Mandela's time in prison and how he handled himself when he got out.  As I read the book, I was inspired. Christians are taught to love their enemies and Mandela is a great demonstration of what that truly means. By treating all people with respect, he won over the hearts and minds of blacks and whites in a country that was greatly divided.  Prior to this, I had never known much about Mandela but I found myself interested in learning even more about him...the sign of a great book.

B002ZG9788|5.0|\\"Clash of the Titans\\" is an exciting and entertaining sword and toga style adventure that is based around Greek mythology stories with familiar characters such as the gods (Zeus, Hades, etc) and creatures such as the Medusa and the Kraken. This particular tale centers around Perseus (who we find out early on is the illegitimate son of Zeus; therefore making him a demigod or half god, half man). Perseus is content to live his life as a fisherman and is ignorant to how unordinary he actually is. Of course, a life as an anonymous fisherman is not in the cards for Perseus who soon finds himself in the middle of a war between the gods and the people of Argos who have chosen to defy the gods and go their own way. What follows is an action packed adventure that finds Perseus and a ragtag group of soldiers going up against giant scorpions, Medusa, and other equally nasty creatures in a quest to save Argos from total annihilation.  I thought the overall story was very entertaining. I have always enjoyed Greek mythology and was familiar with all the gods and people that inhabit the story. I thought the overwhelming odds that Perseus and his soldier companions had to face was effectively daunting. The viewer can easily see how overmatched a mortal is against creatures created by the gods and how invincible a god is (a person is like an insignificant fly to a god and just as easily crushed). The film also portrays Perseus' abilities well as a demigod (although he has no military training he is naturally skilled and stronger than a mortal). I also like how the gods were portrayed in this film. I was always of the opinion that the gods were selfish, pompous and arrogant and treated mortals as their personal playthings especially Zeus. Liam Neeson's portrayal of Zeus is dead on with the vision I have of him. Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Hades is also very good. I always thought Hades got a raw deal especially with all he did to defeat the titans; Fiennes depicts Hades' jealousy andrage mixed with cleverness and cunning very well.  Sam Worthington was convincing as Perseus (I believed his mixture of being naive to the world but skilled as a demigod). Gemma Arterton as Io was also very good as Perseus' protector, guide, and love interest (I really like her voice as well; I like listening to her talk!). I think the standout character and performance lies with Mads Mikkelson's Draco, commander of the soldiers. I always think that the real heroes of these types of stories are the secondary characters that brave the danger with no advantages. Draco is a skilled fighter and does an incredible job of dealing with the overwhelming odds set against them by the gods; for a mortal that's pretty admirable. Mads Mikkelson really makes this movie in my opinion.  The Blu-ray looks and sounds excellent and helps further the epic nature of the film. I have the non-3D version of this movie. I have not seen the 3D version, therefore, I cannot comment on the quality of that version of the film (not a huge fan of 3D on these types of movies). The special features were ok (nothing special, just standard stuff).  If you like Greek mythology and movies like \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Troy\\", \\"300\\", and \\"Immortals;\\" \\"Clash of the Titans\\" is the movie for you. It's a popcorn movie epic at its best.
014241543X|3.0|I can not get over the number of reviewers you said that they did not cry at least ONCE while reading this book. While I agree there were flaws I have to ask, are you people heartless? I bawled like a baby!  I'll skip the basic synopsis since it seems so well covered. I was truly touched by the conversations Gramps and Kim had with Mia. Both were so emotionally raw and intimate. The author did such an amazing job on these 2 conversations - conveyed such love, such hurt and emotion. I completely lost it when Gramps tells Mia its OK to go, and then again when Kim tells her she still has family. Those 2 scenes will definitely stay with me for a long time.  I also love Adam's scene at the end, how he uses music, particularly Yo Yo Ma, to bring Mia back. Again, it was an act out of love, desperation, hope and fear. The author really captured the full spectrum of emotions.  I agree that the story wasn't perfect. I did find some of the flashbacks a bit boring, and found myself wanted to skim over them a bit and get back to what was happening to Mia and her family. I also wish there was more development between Mia and Adam - their relationship was very sweet, but in order to find it as profound as it was supposed to be, i needed something more.  I also would have liked more emotion from Mia and more time spent thinking / feeling about the loss of her parents and her brother. I wish Mia was shown desperately trying to find Teddy's hospital.  All in all, this book was a quick read and definitely moved me. I recommend it to all.
B004LROMQG|3.0|If it wasn't more Morganna, I would love this season. Morganna is heavily emphasized in this season, and I hate her so much it actually reduced my appreciation for the show; it doesn't mean I'm not addicted to it still.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I can say I enjoyed the book. The detail of characters is excellent, details, details details.  I think king stretched a little too far here though, he could have made the book about half the length that it was as there is about 300 pages of filler here.. and the problem is that, the filler is too obvious. As a reader it is obvious that King is trying to stretch the pages, instead of a clear plot everything gets lost in what turns out to be for about 300 pages; a painfully boring read.  However with that said, the beginning and end make this book enjoyable and a good bathroom read.  Ken
B000059MEL|5.0|The Discovery Vinyl was a Christmas gift from my parents who know I am Daft Punk crazy. It is really hard to rate music because it is so subjective. Plus you can sample the album to see if it is a good listen.  I will say that this is one of the few albums I listen to at least once every 2 weeks and all the way through. I never want to pick that needle up and skip a beat. If you are a Daft Punk fan, this album is a must!

I have used this headset for a solid week gaming 2 hrs at least each night, and have not had to change the batteries yet. The ability to talk to your buddies online with this headset as well is awesome. It will adjust volume of your teamspeak based upon game volume, this is nice. The only minor complaint i have is the teamspeak volume control dial, it is too sensitive. Either all the way off, or loud. There doesn't seem to be any in between. This headset is completely worth the money paid for it. Buy these and sit back relax and enjoy 7.1 surround [...] Pure greatness.

0316056863|2.0|I love watching Tina Fey on 30 Rock and on SNL.  I was bored with her book and didn't finish it.  Maybe when I have nothing better to do I will pick it up and finish reading it.  Maybe.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Just finished listening to the new album this morning. Love it. I'd heard several of the tracks before on YouTube and previously purchased the EP with Blue Jeans and Video Games on it. To use a quote from Video Games \\"It's better than I even knew\\". Her voice is incredible, her lyrics are mesmerizing. A friend originally told me about her so I'd been anticipating the release of the full album. After her SNL debut one of my coworkers told me about her too and said she thought I'd like her. I said I already knew about her and did like her. My coworker told me about the critics and the controversial SNL performance. But I actually hadn't heard of the critics my coworker was quoting and my coworker had to explain to me who Eliza Dushku and Brian Williams were which I found hysterical. Ignore the \\"famous\\" (LOL) critics and check out Lana Del Rey for yourself and if you want to know who Eliza Dushku and Brian Williams are do a web search.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|this book is hands down my favorite book to date. i have read it multiple times and i am equally as haunted each time. yes, it is a tad predictable but such a well crafted book nonetheless. the intertwining of the two stories was so interesting and i always found my self wanting to keep reading to reach the next section. it has a lot of factual information that taught me a lot i didn't know. every time i read this it stays with me for a long time. after seeing the movie i would definitely agree that the book trumps the movie, the characters were not shown on screen quite how i imagined them and the book is far more detailed. in all this is an excellent book and would recommend it to most. if easily upset however, read with caution.
B001A50716|5.0|Serbian director Kusturica made this beauty of a bizarre comedy in 1993. It seems to be little known in the US, though it has some American stars. Johnny Depp was still a boyish young man then, while Faye Dunaway and Jerry Lewis were quite a bit further along in their careers.<br /><br />Apart from the ubiquitous white dog and the proliferating turtles, we have a flying halibut, weight-lifting balloons, not to forget Jerry Lewis speaking a local dialect of native Alaskan people, and Lili Taylor playing the accordion for all occasions, when she is not trying to commit suicide.<br />Depp is the center of the tale. He works in the New York fisheries service initially, where he tags fishes. Then he moves to Arizona to be with his uncle. At first he sells cars, and then he moves in with an older woman. The couple is obsessed with flying and builds various contraptions, often sabotaged by the woman's jealous step daughter.<br />There is a brother to the Depp character who is into old movies and who loves to re-enact the Cary Grant scene with the crop duster in North by Northwest. One should beware what one wishes for!<br /><br />Remember the other movie scene where a departing space craft flies up and away across a full moon? I had references to that scene now in two movies in a row: first in In America, by Jim Sheridan in 2004, now here. Jerry Lewis is in an ambulance after a heart attack, and on the way to the hospital, the car is seen lifting up and flying past the full moon of Arizona.<br />What a lovely absurd film!<br />I am particularly impressed by Lili Taylor and wonder why she made not more of an acting career.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|couldn't find a cover to fit my new Kindle Fire...bought one and when I got it home,  it didn't fit...very disappointed...then I remebered Amazon and searched there for a cover...Found this one...it looks good and fits perfectly.  Thanks
030788743X|5.0|This was a great book!  I have to admit I haven't read a book I could not put down in a while.  This was one... the characters are interesting, show real growth, and I LOVED the 80s pop culture references.  Not too heavy handed.  Great bad guys, great plot twists.  T
0374275637|5.0|One can easily say that this book is a must read for anyone in a position to make business decisions. I would extend the set by exhorting that everyone should read this book to understand how to make better decisions.
0307959856|5.0|I feel like I have only recently discovered the surprising proliferation of what is essentially a higher-class fan fic: Jane Austin sequels, in which writers try to imitate Austin's classic style with fresh stories featuring favorite characters from her novels. Now renowned novelist P.D. James presents her own story set six years after the conclusion to Austin's \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" It is the night before Pemberley's annual autumn ball, and the festivities have already begun for Elizabeth and Darcy; but their dinner party is brought to an abrupt end by the unexpected arrival of Lydia Wickham, hysterically screaming about a murder in the woods. Lydia's husband is the prime suspect, and the lengthy trial that follows is a demanding drain on everyone involved. Despite their history together, Darcy cannot believe that Wickham is guilty of murder, but can evidence be found to prove his innocence?<br /><br />\\"Death Comes to Pemberley\\" is a fantastic offering in this niche genre. James does an outstanding job staying true to Austin's original style, which tends to be hit-or-miss for many authors. The characters are well-written and realistic, and even the long, flowing descriptions of the grounds of Pemberley come across as authentic. On top of that, the story itself - an engaging murder mystery - is a pleasure to take in, and will keep readers guessing up until the dramatic conclusion.<br /><br />Originally published for San Francisco/Sacramento Book Reviews.
0061122416|2.0|Come on people. The writing quality is barely high-school level, assuming that it was translated fairly. How many times can one endure reading the same message over and over? \\"Follow your Personal Legend.\\" Geez. If this is a revelation, you need to get out and challenge yourself more.

B0033WDCRA|5.0|This 25th Anniversary Edition reissue contains a remastered version of the original album plus a bonus CD containing rare and previously unreleased material/remixes. The bonus CD is nice, but the real gem here is the remastered album. For owners of the original (vinyl) release of this record, this has the exact track listing and identical versions of the songs contained on that LP release. They don't have the altered track line-ups or alternate mixes as was the case on previous CD releases of Welcome To The Pleasuredome. This IS the CD you are looking for!  The audio on this remastered edition is simply amazing, especially compared to the flat sound of the original CD release(s). You really get to appreciate the amazing production on this album now, with higher highs and lower lows. The audio has really been cleaned-up and is now crisp and clear. Play it loud, or pop on a good pair of headphones and enjoy!  As for the album itself, what can be said? It has much more to offer than just its well-known single releases (Relax, Two Tribes, The Power Of Love). It's a true 80's classic, and an enduring tribute to the talents of the band and their producer, Trevor Horn. For audiophiles, this a true masterpiece (and master class) of recording and production from the pre-digital era. Glad to see it finally get the CD release/remaster treatment it deserves.
B004M9ZI0M|5.0|Admittedly I have trouble with Shakespeare. When I read his works, I have trouble understanding the scene. When I see it in a film, I have trouble understanding the language. I was able to watch this version with the subtitles and thoroughly enjoyed the genius of The Bard. The language is old, but the musical background has been updated. Great performances. I would love to see a series of Shakespeare done this way, although let's keep the genders intact next time. Mirren was fantastic as were the CG effects.<br /><br />2 f-bombs (Hey I had the subtitles on!) no sex, brief Ariel nudity?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|So far most games are pretty fun. (Have about 30-35 games unlocked.) The ads really aren't that bad. There is a small bar with ads on the bottom of the screen when you are playing. I don't even notice it anymore, and I don't hit it by accident much. Ads pop up maybe after about every 5 or 6 games. I don't know for sure since it doesn't bother me or seem like a big deal. Great free game with a lot of variety!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The downside of this game is that it would be impossible to unlock all of the higher games.  you would have to play this constantly!
1466401885|5.0|this is a must have book, this book shows what all relationship can go through, you will talk and think about this book after you have read it. it was perfect, i dont know how \\"jamie mcguire\\" did it with this book but it had me feeling all the emotions they did in the book =:) ABSOLUTELY AWESOME:), although the book is to be fiction, this book does show love in it,<br />it will make you feel the emotions of the characters.

0345479092|5.0|This book has changed my life with my 10 week old in 4 days, and still getting better. I had started with Dr. Sears and attachment parenting and have the added complication of a reflux baby- his reflux made him want to eat all the time (some don't like to eat because of pain and some think, my tummy hurts, I am hungry). I definitely fell into the accidental parenting complex the book warns against- on demand feeding meant feeding everytime he cried- and for the most part it quieted him but I was going crazy and he would scream in the evenings. He was still waking up to eat every 2 hours and we were so sleep deprived! Some people, especially second time+ parents may be comfortable enough in reading cues that this seems silly to them, but for me and I am sure other first time parents it can be confusing. Dr. Sears Baby book made me think that by doing \\"Attachment parenting and feeding on demand\\" I would be able to better read my baby cues- for me that wasn't the case.  After reading this I had several Eureka moments! My son's crying in the evenings wasn't due to pain or reflux or hunger...he gets overtired and overstimulated by that point in the day and I've been missing his cues that he is tired. He was taking cat naps all day downstairs on the couch with me, usually being held or eventually I would try to put him down with a 40% success rate. I wasn't getting anything done during the day and trying to plan Dr. visits, other appts was a nightmare.  This book has really helped me learn to read my sons cues, get him to sleep on his own in his own bed, and teaches me what to do if I miss our sleepy window and he goes into meltdown mode. Within the second night of following her suggestions he went 9:30-2 pm without a feeding and then 2-5. We're working slowly to make sure he is really hungry when he wakes up and sometimes that means getting him back to bed without a bottle (rather than taking the easy way out and feeding him so I don't have to get up again in an hour) and it seems to be working. Her EASY routine advocates eating then activity and sleep so you don't get into a eat=sleep pattern (guilty!). I am not a \\"schedule\\" person and was really hesitant as soon as I saw schedule in her book but realized it wasn't all that bad and not a rigid timeline but more a guideline for your day. After analyzing the log for a couple of days I was able to see his sleep patterns to know we usually have a couple of short naps 9ish and 11ish- a long one at 1-2:30 and another long one from about 4-5:30. We were not putting him to bed for the night until 9:30 now we have him out for the night around 7-7:30 with a \\"dream feed\\" before I go to bed. Yesterday my husband was amazed when I was completely dressed with a clean house and dinner being made because I now can use those more efficient nap times to get things done and most importantly he seems WAY happier. I am getting more smiles and less fuss which means even when he is awake he is in a better mood and I can put him down and walk away for a few minutes to make myself a cup of tea, or lunch or take a phone call.  I definitely recommend following up with either her The Baby Whisperer Answers All Your Questions or the ones specifically on breastfeeding and sleep- for me the sleep one ($2.99 on Kindle) was great because they offer a little more detail which I think was lacking from this book so consider this a good basis and if you need more help the other books might be worth looking at for extra guidance. I also think some people who are very pro-breastfeeding are looking at her advice the wrong way and getting offended. I am breastfeeding and bottle feeding (mostly breast) but it's been hard and I found her attitude toward it refreshing- she is not against breastfeeding at all but says if you choose to go formula for whatever reason (for many the lack of autonomy can be really hard- as it was for me) that she thinks it's okay to supplement or do formula all together. I think if she seems to lean more against breastfeeding it's to help balance what most women are hearing more of the time- that they are bad parents if they don't breastfeed.She just advises you do your homework and realize that certain groups you get advice from may have their own agenda either way and then follow through getting a pediatrician and support network that follows the decision you've made.  SUMMARY:this is a great book for a new parent! It helps to distinguish your baby's crys and learn to read their cues which is easier if you are giving the child some structure to their day. It's a loving approach (no cry it out) but disciplined. I would almost use the word \\"Structured\\" more than \\"Disciplined\\" which sounds harsher. This will help your baby learn to self sooth. I've had to help my baby get to sleep (especially if I miss the early tired cues) but slowly I am getting to a point where I can sit with him quietly for a few minutse until he starts to get that really \\"glazed\\" look in his eye and then lay him down in his crib and let him do the rest and I am enjoying more me time and have a happier child!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The concept of the game is great, and its great for passing time.  The game does become quite challenging in the 3rd set.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book is about Enzo, a dog that loves racing. His owner Denny is an up and coming race car driver. His wife, Eve gets sick and dies. And Eve's parents fight with Denny for custody of his daughter Zoe. All of this is through Enzo's eyes.  This book is about Enzo's life that as he recalling on his last day on earth. The most interesting thing I learned from this book is how a dog thinks and reacts to things that may be normal to humans but not to dogs.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|good game, but freezes and crashes frequently. not sure if its this big screen thats making it slow down or what. galaxy nexus
0062011847|4.0|I liked _Snuff_ for all the usual reasons one loves Discworld: the humor, the mix of real world ideas with the fantastic.  The part on the riverboat (it happened pretty much exactly like it's depicted on the cover art) was pretty amazing.  However, some of the book seemed kind of formulaic.  Members of a new race who were previously looked down upon are now welcomed into society.  In this case, it's the goblins who are revealed to be not the vermin they were treated as, but sentient people with feelings, etc. I did like seeing more of the country society, but it still seems like Ankh-Morpork is dominating everything.  I'd like to see some more of the rest of the Disc like in some earlier Pratchett novels.
B002BU0DPE|4.0|The turtle beach headset is a great value and I recommend it above popular items like the official wireless ps3 headset and any other challenger. The price alone is a very good reason to buy, but the quality of the headset is impressive as well. I can hear footsteps from enemy soldiers as they approach and even hear enemies planting claymores across the map! There is also a master audio switch as well, the operator can set the chat volume to always supersede the game volume so hearing your teammates is not a problem. The bass boost switch is also awesome, ever wondered what lighting a NOOB up with an M60 sounds like? Turn up that base and find out.
142311339X|5.0|The Lost Hero is the first of a series of books about the heroes of Olympus.  It's an action-packed adventure loaded with Greek and Roman mythology.<br /><br />Jason, the lost hero, finds himself on a bus heading to Wilderness School, a camp for delinquents. The trouble is, he has no idea who he is, or how he got there.  He soon learns that he's a demi-god and that his memories have been taken away by Hera, Queen of the gods.  Why?  That's the part we never learn.  What we do know, is that he's on an important mission to save the gods from a horrible uprising.  He and his friends, Piper and Leo, embark on a dangerous journey in which they must fight a family of horrible cyclops, evil mythological characters, and gargantuan giants.<br /><br />This action packed adventure is a real page-turner. Kids will want to read the next book in the series, Son of Neptune, to find the answers to some of the unresolved questions in the plot.  The Lost Hero is definitely a great read and a brilliant way to teach kids about Greek and Roman mythology.
B000001F95|4.0|Knopflers music is always creative and inspired. I owned a record shop (remember those?) when the first Dire Straits Lp came out. All the punks and everyone wanted it and they were rightly hailed as the next big thing. Suddenly and inexplicably Knopfler and Dire Straits became \\"uncool\\", perhaps due to Knopfler's outspokeness on drugs. History will resurrect their reputation. I often wonder what on earth people will make of Bob Dylan in 200 years time?

076115678X|5.0|If you have curly hair, even if you don't wear it curly all the time, you owe it to yourself to read this book.  Always wearing your hair curly is the repeated focus of this book but even if you don't, you will learn more about how to take care of your hair, how to get it to look its best when curly, and how to come to terms with your hair (you curly gals know what I'm talking about).  I have learned to treat my hair better whether wearing it straight or curly.  I've learned to accept my curliness, even though I like the freedom of mixing it up every now and then.  So read this.  It's good for the curly gal's soul.

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|angry brids  is a fun game for kids and adults. this game is all over the world. I play it all the time u should too.
0446547603|4.0|Another hit by Nicholas Sparks. I love the twists he incorporates into his stories. And this one is no different. It is my opinion that this is one of \\"Nick's\\" more suspenseful story lines, I found myself on the edge of my seat in areas of the story. I was in wonder of how the character, Jo's real purpose would culminate. Having read all his books, I knew there would be an outcome relative to her that would have an interesting twist. I was pleasantly surprised by the result and so will you be. Although not his finest work, a fine piece of work non the less. I give it 4 stars.
B005HSL626|5.0|um the game is super fun. but sometimes there are to many adds because when I get on the game a bunch of adds pop up. so u should beweare of all the adds. u shouldnt delete this game just exit the adds out and you will be fine. ;)
B0068TL23G|5.0|this game is fun. it also reminds me of the tron world. the movie I love.I enjoyed this.because of the crazy Colorado and cooky puzzles.
0451232577|5.0|I am about halfway through this book and have loved it. The characters are well developed, the plot moves very quickly, and there is always the feeling you'd like to read just one more chapter. Very well done by Follet. I like this book better than even his previous medieval trilogy and highly recommend it. I'm already looking forward to the next in this series.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I finished the book and loved it. Gave it to my wife to read and she likes it too. A very well done piece of historical fiction with a sweeping plot line. A must read if you like history and stories about families.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very fun to play. hard to beat because of all of the points needs to buy new games. but all in all very fun.

B00138H68M|3.0|I pulled Is This It out for the first time in a long while after seeing that Rolling Stone named it the #2 album of the 2000s, but I had the same reaction I did 10 years ago: It's way too familiar. Hundreds of bands have inspired by The Velvet Underground--it seems as though a new crop surfaces every decade. But I can't think of another band that earned as much critical acclaim as The Strokes while borrowing so liberally from the Velvets. (Actually, Sonic Youth may be an exception, but they're also a far better band.) Julian Casablancas sings like Lou Reed with an adenoid problem, drummer Fabrizio Moretti unsuccessfully mimics the primal beat that Maureen Tucker pioneered, and the songs are simply unmemorable. The irony is that so many better bands that have emerged in the decade since Is This It cite this album as a major inspiration when so little new ground was broken by it.
0525423656|1.0|This book was about hiking through the Grand Canyon. That's it, really.  Please do yourself a favor and just read the summary online.  The first book, boring as it was, was a) much better than this and b) had a concept that piqued my interest.  The only reason i will be reading the third book is to see how the series closes out.
1401922414|5.0|I love love absoulutely love this calendar!  I have it sitting on my kitchen counter where everyone in the house can see it everyday!  I swear the affirmations create a positive energy just by being in our surroundings.  My 11 year old looks forward to changing the page everyday, and even my 6 year old will occasionally say, \\"I like that one, Mom!\\".  They are a great start to our day and a pleasant reminder throughout.  They are so inspiring, that I often keep them and strategically tape them to my bathroom mirror and other places around the house where my family will notice them during the day.  The only problem is that I haven't found any of them that I want to get rid of yet!!!  I am a big fan of the I Can Do It Conferences, as they are so uplifting!  These calendars were sold out at the last two conferences that I attended, so I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon! When I found them, I proceeded to buy several for friends as New Year's presents. Buy this calendar and you will be uplifted too! Even if Jan is over, you still have all the rest of the year to benefit from them!

B006PTL1QM|5.0|first let's give acting credit where it is due.  yes, the two male actors do a wonderful job.  but the jump out of your seat and yell bravo performance certainly goes to keira knightly as first jung's patient and then freud's.  she opens the movie as a psychiatric patient being forcibly conveyed to jung's clinic.  she covers the gamut of range of emotion because she starts out as patient and ends up as therapist.<br /><br />fassbender and mortenson do the more restrained jobs that playing jung and freud would require.  there are strong emotions running between the two men but as analysts this must be conveyed in their typical observational and subdued style.  for example, freud has a number of problems with jung and they aren't sexual!  first and foremost, he envies him that he is married to one of the wealthiest women in europe.  next, freud suffers from all the coming thunder of being a Jew in a Germany which will erupt against Jews.  Jung has no such religious or ethnic background to constantly battle.<br /><br />they only knew one another for seven years and then parted over divisive beliefs in where psychoanalytic practice should develop. they knew one another before the world wars broke out in europe. both are regarded as giants in the psychiatric field.  few people, at least in america, receive either straight jungian or freudian therapy today.  the major factor is that the cost of rendering such treatment does not fit within our health care system.  however, all branches of treatment used today feature the basic precepts established by these two men.<br /><br />i am not surprised that david cronenberg directed.  this subject matter needed a very visionary old hand.  i think he succeeded very well in bringing a potentially difficult subject to the screen.  i've always been fascinated by this subject and these men so it was not hard for me to love this movie.  if you barely know who they are, you may not have my enthusiasm for it.  although it is hard to imagine how anyone could not love keira knightley's performance.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

B0063GORYU|4.0|I really like this game. Good graphics nice and easy to use. Perfect except for the full page ads every time you start a new hand. It gets old really fast. I actually uninstalled it because of the ads. Prefer smaller ad at top our bottom that I don't have to close to play! I know it's free but still it is a pain.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is one of the most useful apps out there. the uses are endless and it's soo easy to use. I give evernote a 9 out of 10 scale. thank u evernote Corp for this software.
B002VRZEYM|1.0|I wanted to like this, and watched about 40 minutes.  But, when it became transparently evident that this docudrama would be for the most part totally one-sided agi-prop of business = bad, vs. any sense of balance that there are good things that  have come of changes in food production, I just stopped watching.  Really a bunch of do-gooder libby libs that see no value in more efficient food production that allows us to eat a wider variety of foods more cheaply.  If they had their way, we would still have the butter churn and we could all eat a sandwich for $37.50 --- but boy the one sandwich a month we could afford to eat would be oh so organic.  What a bunch of crap this movie is!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm playing this almost every lunch break. it's so addictive. i think the development did a good job in keeping this as classical, yet elegant as possible. good work!
B005I6EVUG|5.0|This case fits the personality of the new Kindle Fire. It's both stylish and functional.  The case is light enough to fit is a purse while also protecting the device. And since I enjoying traveling both personally and through reading and well as the other avenues available on the K-Fire, the design of the case enhances this new Kindle.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|It isn't often that one will listen to a whole album of an artist and enjoy nearly every song, or in fact, EVERY SINGLE SONG.  I have to say, I have listened to each of the songs on this album and all seem to be so evocative, solemn, and rejuvenating.  Now let me just add, if you want the full experience, then definitely purchase the deluxe edition of this album as you will then receive this chaotic, malicious, and almost torture-esque song called Lolita, Without You which is a song that leaves you reaching for someone to love and never letting them leave, and lastly is Lucky Ones which is thematically about two people who I believe made it past societal obstacles, managing to stay together; fittingly, it is a lighter and sweeter sounding song.  So lets get the show on the road, here are all the songs with the best ones beginning the list (*=Deluxe Album):  1. Summertime Sadness (Oh my god this is like a emotional ballad that strikes a chord right in your soul...)  2. Dark Paradise (Peaceful and solemn ballad of loss and rememberance)  3. Without You* (All my dreams and all the lights mean... nothing without you...)  4. Million Dollar Man  5. Lucky Ones*  6. Blue Jeans  7. This Is What Makes Us Girls  8. Video Games  9. Radio  10. Born To Die  11. National Anthem  12. Diet Mountain Dew  13. Carmen  14. Lolita*  15. Off To The Races  Now let me just get this straight since many loved Diet Mountain Dew and I put it as number 12, it is GREAT!  The whole album is splendid!  But, it is just not my top favorite. :P  Even Off To The Races has a great chorus to it that I like!  All in all, please purchase this album or better yet, the Deluxe edition that is only $9.49.  This woman deserves fame for the RIGHT reasons and deserves not to be defamed because of her lips, her \\"mysterious past\\" (formally known as Lizzy Grant with the same personality), or her authenticity (really critics... look at Lady Gaga!).  She CAN sing live unlike many others and is trying to come into herown.  I've also heard many of her interviews and she is quite profound regarding her view upon her songs and the stories she tells.  She is articulate, cutely timid, and quite down-to-earth.  So with that, buy the album and do her and YOURSELF a favor.  Thank you! :)
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I know that Invicta sometimes gets a bad rap, but the fact is, they produce some nice watches at a great price. I saw this watch and loved the look instantly. I wasn't crazy about the band but found a great Italian rubber dive strap with stainless inserts online for about $20. I know the specs say it's 21mm but a 22mm fits perfect. Hope you can see the picture. I also put a screen protector from an iPhone on it and you can't even see it. Now any light scratches won't be permanent. Great Deal! Also amazon gives the 1 year warranty so I know I'm protected if it has a factory defect.
B0068TL23G|5.0|Very addictive. Once you start you'll find it hard to put it down. Puzzles get more difficult gradually. Thought provoking yet low stress.  Runs great on Droid RAZR.
0143119680|5.0|This book was great. I loved the history in it. The author really took time in developing all the characters too. I can't wait for the 2nd book!
B006MQRLSA|5.0|This movie was awesome. Brad Pitt was great and Jonah Hill Killed his roles. They did a great job in explaining what had happened and the moves made for the historical record that the Oakland A's achieved. A must see for anyone who loves sports movies
B0058VW36U|5.0|Very creative and addicted game.Worth the money. Keep you busy even on the train or bed. Waiting for more levels :)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous written by Alex and Stephen Kendrick is a powerful film about the preciousness of life, the consequences of bad choices, the responsibility of fathers, the hope of forgiveness, and the opportunity to glorify God by serving others.<br /><br />It is action packed throughout with funny and heartbreaking moments that will make you laugh and cry. The main theme is how God works for good in situations that just don't make sense to us.<br /><br />The targeted audience in this film is fathers. However, everyone should see this, even though the main message is for dads. It is filled with important life lessons that we are all sure to face at some point in our lives.<br /><br />I'm guessing many of the people that will see this movie are Christians. But I'm praying right now that many non-Christians will see this movie as well.<br /><br />As the movie repeatedly states, \\"You must get right with God first, before you do this...\\" There is no way we can watch this movie and start obeying God on our own. The first step is to admit our sin and trust in Christ. Everything else flows from that.<br /><br />I am not a father, but I hope to be one some day. This movie made me think about the weighty responsibilities of being a dad and how hard it is to follow Christ in this world. It dropped me to my knees, helplessly begging God to help me. I believe it will do the same to you!<br /><br />Thanks to everyone who made this movie possible. And all glory to Jesus Christ!
0756405890|4.0|Fantasy novels are not usually my thing.  But, this is very good.  It is very well written and interesting.  I hope the future 2 books are this good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|With kids all over the Pacific NW, this is a great little tool to keep up on what's happening weatherwise with them. The near term weather hour by hour is also great. It links to a more complete forecast if you want, and it's so easy to use.  Nice job Accuweather on a fine little app.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great app.  It's interface is slick and the info shows up fast.  It was easy to set up and I haven't any problems.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great to play when you are bored. keeps me entertained on rainy days. overall good games with varying levels of difficulty
B000GLKLCK|5.0|If my house was on fire I would grab this set, Beethoven's 32 sonatas by John O'Conner, and all my Tartini cd's!!!<br /><br />Anytime I can't decide on what I want to hear, I always put on  Mozart's piano concertos.<br /><br />Murray is my favorite pianist for the Mozart piano concertos. His soft natural approach is poised against the reverb and acoustics of the piano creating perfection to my ears.<br />I have heard many play Mozart well, but Murray is the best fit for me. Played at the right speed! Thanks Murray!<br /><br />The CD's did not all load on my computer properly. Some cancelled others out previously ripped when they were being ripped onto my computers  (that's sad) !!<br /><br />Good day!
B0037VNX44|4.0|Reading the synopsis, I didn't really know what to expect...going into the movie.<br /><br />But what I found, was quite a wild ride, but simplistic in nature. And honestly the one question that plagues my mind after watching this.. What did Bronson want? Was it really to gain simple fame? To leave a mark on society as a whole? Because hey a movie was made after him, he has some books out, and is still apparently by this film, in prison. But we all now know of him. At least a good chunk of people.<br /><br />I mean, the only thing he does through out the whole film, is beat people up. Locations change... But all he seems to do, is just beat up prison guards, and get beat up. What's he after? To find that breaking point of his? And later on in the film, the dude gets buck naked. yes, and has a guard rub .. some paste onto him? Its white. And then at a later point, he gets covered in black paint. Which maybe has some sort of...symbolic meaning? The reason I bring this up, hopefully someone will read my review and give me a heads up, is because he is on stage as well several times through out the movie, talking to the audience. I figure the two are connected.<br /><br />And if he liked beating people up so much, why didn't he just get into boxing? At least then he'd been facing people that were his equal match and earning money.<br /><br />One thing I want to mention is the movie isn't your standard fare. It doesn't really have a ending. It just stops. And its an oddball movie in its pacing. (Maybe their was a lot that was cut?) It seems like it should have been a little longer.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is a fun exciting puzzle game with tricks and turns on every level. it will be hours of fun and is by far one of the best games I have played on my kindel fire. it is a great buy and will keep you playing till its over.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This book is so awesome.  I plan to use it everyday and every chance I get I will share it with everyone I cam.
0143143492|5.0|I had listened to \\"The Power of Now\\" and was deeply moved by the material and Mr.Tolle's presentation. \\"A New Earth\\" develops much of the same material and adds a further dimension. Not a day goes by since I first began to listen to these works, that I have not thought a great deal about and/or experimented with the teachings. I have been tremendously affected in a positive way through his discussions of time, space and form, and especially thought as a form. I have found great usefulness and some comfort from his interpretations of some of the bible's and Jesus' more challenging statements, especially those which I had previously taken to be exclusive/divisive in nature. I have given both books out as gifts, and I will definitely listen to both in their entirety again in the future.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|blah blah blah blah there are a lot of different and fun games that keep u entertained. blah blah blah blab
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good game, fun for passing time. Haven't found any bugs yet. Wish you could chang the design of the deck though.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|This is the first book I have read about North Korea and truth be told...it fascinated, shocked and frightened me. Most of us know something about North Korea. Whether it be something we heard on the news or read in the paper, most people at least have an idea of what is happening in this oppressed country. I know this is a work of fiction but the author's characters and the way he portrays their lives brings to life that which seems surreal for those of us who live in a democracy. The plot was engaging and very unique. I enjoyed everything about this book.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie was a huge help in learning and teaching my own parents the ways my own son  tends to view the world. So glad Temple has allowed us this very personal look into her  life and giving us \\"normal\\" parents some useful  tools to help our children lead successful and enriched lives.
0439023521|5.0|Really, a page turner from start to finish.  Although for a younger reader, I could not put it down !
B0034G4P94|5.0|In a word, fantastic. That is how I would describe this movie.  I passed it by again and again thinking \\"I've seen this movie a million times.\\" I thought it would be a rip-off of The Fighter. I thought it would be terrible and low-budget.  How wrong I was . . . I only watched this movie after reading a quick blurb in Entertainment Weekly where the author opined this movie should get a best picture nomination.  He was dead-on.  This movie was what The Fighter should have been.  It has a few weaknesses (a bit predictable in places, some amazing coincidences) but in the end it just doesn't matter because this movie does what few others do anymore: it tells a great story that really stays with you.  I am sick of movies where all the money is spent on special effects and the script gets whatever is leftover.  This movie is about two brothers torn apart by their dysfunctional family when they are young.  Sound bleak?  It really isn't because overall this is a movie about the human spirit. The story is told against the backdrop of MMA fighting, but the story is the real draw, the MMA is just the vehicle for it.<br /><br />Mark my words: Tom Hardy will become the greatest actor of his generation.  (a secret - he already is).  He is the next big bad in the upcoming Batman movie.  Check him out in a little British mini-series called \\"The Take.\\"  The man is a true chameleon if there ever was one. Nick Nolte also delivers a performance unmatched in his career.  He was just nominated for an academy award for best supporting actor for this role.<br /><br />Think you've seen this movie before? Trust me, you haven't.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Considering I paid for this app on this very same phone through this very same app store, I would say someone at Amazon has some explaining to do. #thieves
B0068RHGJM|5.0|Obviously it's hard to live up to fan expectations after a couple years of anxious anticipation, but Nightwish pulled it off in their own unique style. This album features an eclectic variety of songs while staying true to the tone, character, style and quality that I have come to expect from Nightwish. The composition and orchestration are truly phenomenal. Anette Olzon's vocals really shine in this album with greater power and clarity than in Dark Passion Play. As with many Nightwish albums, some of the songs deal with potentially sad or depressing subject matter in a way that is optimistic, motivational and ultimately uplifting. I can't wait to see they corresponding movie they have been working on!  In short, this is a truly excellent and unique album that I would highly recommend to anyone.
B000N6TX1S|1.0|A crappy sale. Nowhere in the ad does it say that this is a Canadian version dvd. Who the hello in America wants a French language box?
B004HD61KE|5.0|I read the book when it came out, a month before I drove out West and it happen to be all the places mentioned in the book which wad cool.  Rollins books are interesting, quick paced and adventurous.  Love the Sigma Force editions.  Cant wait for the next book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game as much or more than the other. It is hard but not frustrating, challenging but not impossible. Nothing mindless about this one..and thoroughly entertaining. Thanks!
1592332803|4.0|I received this book as a gift from a non-vegan friend, whom in addition to providing me with the book, provided me with 3 sample baked goods derived from the book.  I have tried many of the recipes in this book over the years and it's the one book I am constantly referring back to.  I read a review where someone wrote that it was \\"Limited and Boring\\".  Well, all I can say is that the limitations may be that person's talent and ability.  A Cookbook is but a blue print where to start from to expand your culinary repertoire.  It is up to you to change and substitute ingredients as your individual taste warrants and make them your own.  You don't like white flour, use whole wheat, but be aware of the higher gluten content.  You don't like egg-replacer, use flax seed, banana, apple sauce, etc; a recipe is too sweet, cut back on the sugar.  The point is, try the recipe and then make it your own.  I have made several of these and they have all come out wonderful - foolproof. My favorite are the Mexican wedding cookies, the apple cake, and the chocolate chip cookies.  You won't be disappointed with the flavors!!!  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I want more pictures of the final product.
B005HSL626|4.0|this game is fun but if you play it for a long time it gets boring when you slice the fruit it 's huge splats all over the screen witch is not only fun but funny I think you should buy this app plus it is free.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Really fun and challenging,  but would like to see more levels. My eleven year old finished this in 3 days and was anxious for more challenges.
0898159156|5.0|I recently started raising carnivorous plants and this book has helped me a lot in becoming more knowledgeable about them. It is packed with information on growing various species of carnivorous plants many I had never even heard of before!  The first 60 pages contains general information on carnivorous plants and general growing conditions. The next 220 pages are devoted to informing you about the various species of carnivorous plants and specific growing conditions that they may require. D'Amato clearly did his research when writing this book.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|I saw this one in the theater and hated it. I was told it was an action film. It is not...it is terribly slow. It was pointless and boring.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|I watched Apollo 18 at the theaters about a week after it came out and I wasn't very impressed. I am a die-hard science-fiction fan and the space/alien genre is probably my favorite. The movie has an interesting premise, a secret Apollo mission is sent to the moon to investigate the possibility of a successful Russian mission only to fall prey to some hidden creature. The story, however, ends up being not really that fascinating, and the source of the horror is laughable.  Despite it being mediocre, if you are a fan of space horror and don't mind the \\"moving-camera\\" effects, then this movie may be watchable to you.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love this case for the fire! it adds a little bit more bulk but its not bad at all. it protects it very well which is what i wanted since i tend to drop things a lot! the stand works great it just needs to broken in a little but thats to be expected with anything. it holds the kindle in nice and snug! shipped fast and package was still in perfect condition!
B00433SVP6|5.0|woah this is awesome i am a fan of percy jackson and this is just as good. I love long books and this is good value.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I just got this game and I love it! It is challenging without being overly difficult. I will be recommending this to my friends.
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I loved the movie and the price made even better. The extras that came with it were entertaining as well.
0891419063|5.0|This was a great read especially after watching the series \\"The Pacific\\". Explains in more detail events on the Pacific venue of WWII.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Great movie, but just not the best. It was very entertaining and I look forward to the next one. Would like to see someone else play Green Lantern.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I understand why people are frustrated with some of the changes.  To me, most of them are insignificant and I can ignore them.  I do believe people are overreacting and getting way too angry about something while failing to look at the larger picture.  I watched these films and forgot just how much I loved them (more prevalent with the Original Trilogy) and I enjoyed them with unbelievably awesome picture and sound.  What I do agree with is that some of the changes are just not needed.  I loved that fact that Yoda was changed to CGI in Episode I.  It looked great and was one of the better changes that was made in Blu-ray version.  But changes like the notorious, \\"NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" at the end of the Return of the Jedi and the change in the Krayt dragon call, just didn't make that much sense.  They weren't big enough to ruin the movies for me at all!  It's not like these changes changed the plot!  While I was confused as to why they felt they needed to make the changes, I'm not going to be one of those people who gets angry and goes on here to give it only *.  The changes didn't affect the quality of films (overall they're probably better) or how I would critique the films.  Coincidentally, the one that was tampered with the least in the Original Trilogy, the Empire Strikes Back, is still the finest Star Wars film in my opinion and one of the greatest science fiction films of all time.  To people that are angry...  Chill out.  Just think, \\"Did the changes in the Blu-ray copies completely ruin the way I enjoy Star Wars?\\"
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Her music is rich with imagery like good poetry. Her music takes you by the hand and leads you into a world of tragic and misplaced love. If you've ever experienced romantic loss you will find a familiar friend in the songs on this album.  I find her music to be addictive. Many might buy her album for notable hits like Video Games, Born To Die, and Blue Jeans. However, the rest of the songs on the album are no less potent. \\"Carmen\\" was a pleasant surprise and has become one of my favorites.  I have bought albums in the past that have had two or three songs I liked and the rest never to be played again. This is not the case with this album. All the songs on this album have something to offer the listener. I am very pleased with this album.  The only disappointment, if anything, is the exclusion of \\"You Can Be The Boss.\\" Those of us who have followed her closely have been anticipating the album for some time. Many of her fans love \\"You Can Be The Boss\\" and for some reason it was left off this album. I wouldn't trade any of the songs on the album for it, we just want it in addition to the current songs.  If you are on the fence, do yourself a favor and buy it.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|When I first saw her perform \\"Video Games\\" on SNL, I liked it but it took a little getting used to her songs.  Now, fast forward to it's release day, listening to the all the songs I was honestly blown away by the brilliance of the whole record.  She calls her style hollywood pop/sadcore, with influences so diverse it's hard to pigeonhole her music.  I have to say, she pulls it off perfectly, there isn't even one song I'd skip.  There's no one else like Lana Del Rey.  I have a feeling Born To Die will be among the releases that will define 2012, and will top many a best of the year list.  So, If you don't buy many records, this is one you must get.
B0061S073A|5.0|Dev is very responsive. Product is simple, quick and efficient. No crashes. Easy to configure, options are descriptive and very well laid out. Child is happy to get my phone and not confused. I am happy not having to worry about unauthorized access to different areas. Sort options would be nice. Dev indicated it would be in a future release. :-)

B005HV6Y5W|3.0|As you would expect from director Terrence Malik, The Tree Of Life is a meticulously and beautifully filmed movie.  Every detail is beautifully captured and the film is glorious to look at.  The plot and meaning of the film is a different story.  It basically shows the beginning and end of the universe and ruminates on the meaning of life as told through the memories of Jack (Sean Penn).  Through flashbacks we see Jack from infancy until early teens (Hunter McCracken) and his relationship with his stern father (Brad Pitt) and his gentle, nurturing mother (Jessica Chastain).  The film is sort of a stream of consciousness narrative that jumps from scene to scene and doesn't follow a tradionial plot.  It sort of reminded me of 2001: Space Odyssey in its search for the meaning of life.  It is a bizarre and strange movie that certainly will find its detractors, but it will definitely make you think.
B004I744AS|5.0|this is the best dictionary app ever!!! more than just a dictionary, its also an Encyclopedia and more! get this app :)

B005TBWN0K|4.0|Overall this app is great but it could be better. Now I don't use this app as it shows on there images. I found this to be a great app to write notes on my tablet (kindle fire)! It has similar functions you can find in Windows Journal and so far its the only app I found that is similar. But no Mather if you are taking notes or doodling you need a copy past function to save some time. I suggest that the finger Icon which lets you select an object. After an object is selected when you tap on the Icon again it would give you the option to copy/past, creating a duplicate which will deselect the current object and select the newly created one. This will let the User move the copied object wherever he/she choose.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|I don't have any problems with crashing on my Asus Transformer. It's a really good concept the way you earn stars Angry Birds style  for all the different layouts.  The big problem I have is that the rendering engine has flaws when tiles appear next to other tiles that are shifted vertically by half a tile. It will make tiles look like they are on top of each other when they are beside each other on the same level.  I think its logic for deciding if a tile is selectable is also flawed for layouts where tiles are on a half tile grid. I have seen a case where a tile is drawn as though they are in the same column horizontally and one tile is covering half of the other tile vertically. It seems to favor selecting the bottom tile so it acts as though it drew them backwards, but the odd part is that both tiles are selectable. Level 3-9 is an example of this.  These problems make some of the more complicated layouts unplayable.  Another issue I had was that volume controls were hard to find.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was sort of good because you play games to earn points and you use those points to get even more games.
B0063GORYU|5.0|its been one of my favorite games for years. now I'm happy to have it on my e.reader. you should share it with everyone cause its so addicting.
B0061S073A|5.0|After my 3 year old managed to buy a movie while I was occupied I decided it was time to install some security. This app is perfect and all accidental purchases have stopped.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has lots of mini games and they are lots of fun I really like them the ads are kinda  annoying sometimes but they only show up once in a while but you just x out of the ad and go back to playing they pop up after you die or loose not during the game
B0052UZIFA|5.0|its awesome just that it rodent have the same mini games as the Ds version but it great and fun for everyone
B005N0PJJO|5.0|**Possible Spoilers if you haven't read the first book in the series**<br /><br />After being sucked into the dark world of Christian Grey in the first book, I wasn't sure if my emotions and heart could survive another part of his story. Seriously, after the first book I was just drained of emotion and my head was spinning from the enigma of Christian Grey. Sexual power, control, and wealth is the bubble of Christian. He knows what satisfies him and he doesn't like the word no being in the script. Or does he?<br /><br />This part of the story picks up a few days after Ana has left him. She is falling apart and going through some deep emotions after losing what she thought was love. Christian is also going through hell without his shining light in his dark world. I personally felt crushed for Christian because he is struggling with so much and change is not an easy thing for him. He loves his control and now that Ana has left, he feels all his control slipping away.<br /><br />We also get to see a more playful and romantic side of Christian than what was presented in the first part of this series. I agree with Ana and enjoy this side of Fifty so much more. He has so much love to give, but he is not sure how to do it. When they finally reunite, we get to see them both struggle with trying to make their relationship work without all of the kinky involved. Christian starts to realize that real love doesn't have to involve all of his previous quirks, but he does realize that he will always have it in the back of his mind scratching at the surface. Ana wants to show him what love can be without the darkness and show him love with touch and support.<br /><br />I must say that the tamed down kinky in this book is just as hot as the previous book. I will never look at an elevator, piano, pool table, wall or boathouse the same way again! Oh and the things he could do with that pinkie finger of his was just moan worthy. Although I must say, I am curious to know more about what he can do with a cat like he hinted at. *hmmm* Then my heart bled for Christian in the scene where he thinks Ana is going to leave him again due to his dark past. Christian on his knees in that state of distress will haunt my dreams from now on. I cried at the breakdown of his personality and felt all the control that is so him slip away.<br /><br />Then when Elena -- the woman who is a sore spot for Ana -- gets her just desserts from not only Ana and Christian, but also gets an ear full from Christian's Mother, I was secretly cheering \\"Go Grace!\\" I was waiting for Grace to turn her over her knee and give her a true spanking that she deserved.<br /><br />While the ending will be one readers will enjoy and swoon with, it does have a small section to reveal what is to come. We still need to see the aftermath from Christian's change of course in life and who is planning the destruction of his world. I think I know who it is and I just know that the next and final book is going to put me over the edge! Dark, sensual, and oh so Fifty Shades of messed up!*hmmm* Then my heart bled for Christian in the scene where he thinks Ana is going to leave him again due to his dark past. Christian on his knees in that state of distress will haunt my dreams from now on. I cried at the breakdown of his personality and felt all the control that is so him slip away.  Then when Elena -- the woman who is a sore spot for Ana -- gets her just desserts from not only Ana and Christian, but also gets an ear full from Christian's Mother, I was secretly cheering \\"Go Grace!\\" I was waiting for Grace to turn her over her knee and give her a true spanking that she deserved.  While the ending will be one readers will enjoy and swoon with, it does have a small section to reveal what is to come. We still need to see the aftermath from Christian's change of course in life and who is planning the destruction of his world. I think I know who it is and I just know that the next and final book is going to put me over the edge! Dark, sensual, and oh so Fifty Shades of messed up!

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|good product  It seems to provide adequate protection and is easy to access.  Might like one that is horizantal instead of vertical  Price seemed a little high but now that I have it I believe it is worth the price paid.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I originally purchased this book for my son for additonal readings for his Freshman (h.s.) english class. At his request, I downloaded it to my Kindle. This child is not a reader, but when I tell you he was over halfway finished with the book the first night, I'm not exaggerating. Before he completed the first book, he asked me to buy the other two books in the series. When he started telling me about the plot, I told him they made a film about the book, and we haven't looked back. I began to read it as well via my Android,(thank God for that app!!) and we compared our views. Naturally, he was far ahead of me, so I had to insist on him not revealing anything to me. I finished the last book today, and I'm so thrilled to have read something so original, action-packed, sad, funny, and scary at the same time!!! This was a page-turner from the beginning!! Now, we're awaiting the movie release so we can see if they will do the book justice. This is an excellent read, and I suggest that parents read it along with their children. It's truly awesome!!!
