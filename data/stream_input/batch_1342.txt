B006W0QOF2|1.0|This movie was an absolute waste of time.  Ryan Gosling delivered an extraordinary performance in Crazy Stupid Love, but the writing and directing in this movie were too horrible to be saved.<br /><br />It's long, it's boring, and there is not an ounce of accomplishment gained by the viewer by the end of the movie.  I find it hilarious that \\"Abduction\\" got a lower Rotten Tomatoes score (4%) than this (93%) - and those were the critics' votes, not the audience - and Abduction was ridiculously more entertaining than this.<br /><br />This is the same type of movie as Pulp Fiction, where people say it's great and artsy and hipster, but they really only think that because they don't understand what was going on.  This movie was absolutely terrible, and if you're looking for a way to spend your evening, please don't waste it watching this.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|The third series again makes more comedy in the series with great writing, good interactions of the characters and lots of good comedy with the existing cast members. Tremendous interplay and another great episode. I currently have three and intend to get the fourth.

This is one of those books. It's the kind of book that leaves you physically aching after you shut it; the kind that makes you feel like you'll never look at the world the same. This books rips your heart out and makes you feel like there's a bowling ball sitting on your chest. It makes you crack up laughing, until the people sitting near you on the bus look at you like you're crazy. And best of all, it sews you back together again and makes you think -- really think -- about what it means to live in this crazy, devastating, joyful world.

B001DHXT1G|1.0|This release is marketed as an edition that includes a digital copy of the film. However, this is misleading as the manufacturer did not supply a code to redeem the content on the disc designed for such purpose.

B006IGZX0C|5.0|This moving is wonderfully filled, the actors and actresses are all amazing, and the storyline is beautiful.  From the minute the movie started until the closing credits, this moving had my complete attention.  It is a beautiful story of black maids in the deep south, telling their stories of struggles and survival.  This is a must see movie.
B000009ED0|5.0|I lost my original copy of this, and hadn't listened to it for at least 10 years, and recently on a whim decided to buy another copy.  It's one of the few albums from that era that is as good, if not better than I remember it.  It's clever musically and lyrically.  I'm glad he's still around and successful.

B006O5XYWG|3.0|The storyline tells how the apes rose up to gain control of the planet.  The movie was okay, but you can tell that the apes are computer generated.  One would think with technology where it is today, the animation would be a little more realistic than in this movie.  The acting was average and the plot was basic.  It isn't a bad movie just don't expect it to be an Oscar Winner.
1451648537|4.0|Interesting and well written book by Mr. Issacson. I don't believe it was too soft on Jobs, nor too harsh. As far as ordering goes, Issacson began to jump around quite a bit in some sections, lumping product launches and achievements of the decade together, even though they were separated for some time (Well, \\"some time\\" in the sense of technology). His grouping of items in some chapters (\\"21st century Macs\\") had little to do with the macs released in the 2000s. These are small gripes however, and overall I thoroughly enjoyed this book and getting what will be the only inside perspective on Jobs written, since it was the only one allowed.

B003ES61EE|2.0|This is my third Lens pen after losing the first and destroying the second in the washing machine.  I saw the AmazonBasic model and thought the small tip would be nice for cleaning the viewfinder glass. It does a so-so job at getting to this hard to reach area of the camera.  I have better luck with a microfiber cloth and some cleaning solution.   Anyway, I digress,the \\"polishing\\" tip of this device can be removed and inverted to give you a choice of a ~3/8\\" round polisher or a triangular small polisher.  Here in lies the problem.  When polishing the lens the tip tends to fall off. Not the shammy part, but the tip itself. I've tried every means to seat the tip, but it only stays put at the apex of the front element.  As you circle around it tends to dislodge from the body of the pen. I've ordered a new lens pen to replace this one.  It was a good idea, but in my case an utter failure.  I may have gotten a dud. Let me know your experience.
B005UKJX4E|4.0|Terrence Malick's TREE OF LIFE is a spectacularly beautiful artistic creation that is, at the same time, frustratingly fragmented and difficult to categorize.  While it attempts to explore the origins of the universe and the meaning of life - huge and often incomprehensible subjects - the story it tells is quite simple.  Jack O'Brien (played by Hunter McCracken as a boy, and Sean Penn as a middle-aged adult) grew up in Waco, Texas during the 1950's.  He remembers his mother (Jessica Chastain) as a deeply caring but passive person who was unable to stand up to his strict and domineering father (Brad Pitt).  When Jack's younger brother dies, the incomprehensible grief of it tears the family apart and leaves Jack feeling lost and frustrated.  The film is really Jack's remembrances of the life he led and his search for meaning in the cold and sterile world he lives in as an adult.<br /><br />But the film really isn't about this admittedly thin story.  Told in a series of expressionist images and brief vignettes, with whispered narration the viewer will strain to make sense of, TREE OF LIFE is more pure art than any film I have ever seen.  This makes it breathtakingly beautiful, surprisingly powerful, and ultimately a pretentious piece that is polarizing to its audience.  Film is a visual medium, and Malick takes full advantage of that to spin his grand tale of the ultimate meaning of life.  The choice, he says, is between grace (a vague spiritualism represented by Jack's warm and loving mother) and nature (the blind forces of a cold and uncaring world, represented by Jack's emotionally stunted father).  As a child, Jack was tormented by his father's cruel detachment - he admits in one scene that he is just like his father (\\"I am more like you than I am like her\\").  This, Malick postures, is his undoing.  Like his father (whose life has not turned out as he had hoped), anger and disappointment separate Jack from the loving world made possible through grace.  Jack's epiphany at the end of the film brings him full circle, and helps us see that true grace is always there, always calling to us, even if we don't know its name.<br /><br />I call this film pretentious because it is willing to be pure art.  It's willing to throw itself out there without regard to how it will be received.  This isn't a film that is aimed at a particular audience - it's Malick's film, his visual expression of deep faith.  Some have called the film Christian, and there are certainly references to God and church.  But the spiritualism is really far broader than that.  It's the spiritualism of the universe, and Malick at once acknowledges how small and powerless we humans are and how interconnected we are with things far grander and less comprehensible than our tiny selves.  It's pretentious because Malick pretends to know more than we do.  He dares to suggest that the images he splashes across the screen are sacred and perfect in ways we may not understand.  I don't mean this in a critical way - pure expressions of self can't escape pretension.<br /><br />Did I like TREE OF LIFE?  I'm not sure.  I certainly responded to it.  It reminded me (as it did many others) of Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, especially in its use of color and music to make a grand statement.  I was also distanced from TREE OF LIFE, in the same way I was from 2001 - both films are so vast in their imagery that the viewer can feel lost, especially without the comfort of a linear story to hold onto.  I never felt particularly connected to Sean Penn's adult Jack, which makes it more difficult to truly relate to his epiphany in the film's final act.  But I did feel very moved by young Jack's frustrating relationship with his father, and several scenes between Jack and his younger brother are poignant and powerful (one especially, where Jack and his brother stand on opposite sides of a window, pressing their fingers and hands together against the glass, is beautifully done).<br /><br />Overall, I do recommend this film to anyone who truly appreciates \\"art for art's sake.\\"  Don't expect a traditional story, and don't expect your questions to be answered.  But if you enjoy the idea of questions, and if you're willing to let the answers evolve over time, as you think about the film, wonder about it, and re-imagine it, then give it a chance.  Ultimately, what this film will be for you depends on what you bring to it.  This is true for all great art.  It's not easy, but it can be worth it.o truly appreciates \\"art for art's sake.\\"  Don't expect a traditional story, and don't expect your questions to be answered.

B006PZBR8S|1.0|Wish I hadn't trusted these reviews when picking a movie to watch.  Only 3 1-star reviews.  Wow.  Seriously people?  The movie was predictable, and the fighting was nothing cool, just boxing.  Transformers had better robot fighting.  But mainly, the kid is absolutely annoying and you hope the robot punches him in the face at some point.  And Jackman's character is equally unlikeable.  A POS father figure who has a half-assed turn around.  Wish I had spent my 2 hours and $4 on something better,  like anything other than REAL STEEL.

B006H3MIV8|5.0|This may be the best album of covers I have ever heard.  And the fact that it is Dylan songs that are being covered makes it 900% better.  Yes, there are a few misfires (Miley Cyrus, Kesha, for instance) but by and large the material is well-crafted, innovative, and great!  This is a steal at this price, and would have been a bargain at twice the price or even more.  Did you get the hint? I like it!!!
B005DTEUAE|1.0|The sticker on the outside of this vinyl package states 'pressed on 180gram audiophile quality vinyl'  Don't let that trick you into purchasing this. This is a terrible master. It was done by Vlado Meller, who's mastered every Chili Pepper's album since 1999's 'Californication'. All of which have suffered from some of the worst mastering of all time. They're so loud they're clipped into the red. So good luck hearing any clarity or definition in his mastering through the waves of digital distortions shredding your ear drums.  Clearly by 2006, John Frusciante (he seems to have developed an increased interest in sound quality as years have progressed, using analog to record his solo ventures and mastering his 2009 solo album 'The Empyrean' very dynamically, which was a far cry from his Chili Pepper's world) had enough and Steve Hoffman was hired to master John's swan song, 'Stadium Arcadium' for vinyl. Steve Hoffman did a great job and the vinyl sounds rich and detailed, with lots of definition between instruments and most importantly the bass isn't drowned out in waves of static digital distortions.  But now with John gone, Warner Music have just resorted to having the lame, the deaf, the terrible, the anti music himself, Vlado Meller, make a vinyl master of this album to cash in on the vinyl sales boom.  What you're presented with when you drop the needle onto the grooves of this vinyl is very treble heavy thin sound, with no definition, very sharp, muddy and brittle sounding, with mostly inaudible bass, which in my opinion is sacrilegious considering the talents of Flea. It's not a pleasant listen and hurts your ears more than the commercially released loudness war CD.  I bought this vinyl after downloading a FLAC vinyl rip of a torrent site. I thought maybe i downloaded a bad rip. But nope.  Honestly Warner, enough is enough, fans have suffered through 4 RHCP albums mastered by Vlado Meller! What the f__k? Do you even listen to the music before you release it? Haveyou listened to the beautiful dynamics in the 'Blood Sugar Sex Magik' CD (which thankfully wasn't given a 20th anniversary remaster like Nirvana's Nevermind) lately?  facebook.com/dynamicRHCP

0316098329|5.0|We read Room for our book club a couple of months ago, but I can't stop thinking about it. It is very easily one of the best books I've ever read. I began reading the book with no preconceived notions, having not even read the back-cover text before opening the book. The story is from the point of view of a young child who is describing his living environment. It gripped me from the first paragraph. The reader  discovers this child was born in captivity and if the offspring of a kidnapping victim and her abuser. Had the book been narrated by the mother, it might have been depressing, but from a five-year-old's point of view, the world is still a wondrous place. I don't want to spoil the story for those who haven't read it, but the book was incredibly inspiring and thought-provoking. Loved it!
0525478817|5.0|I stand behind my pedestrian title. This book is a very good read. I can think of no finer example of a gripping, honest, emotionally-charged story, and say with confidence that John Green is currently the best young-adult writer around.  On the surface, it's an over-used plot. But I feel like all that has to be said, has been said. But people are still falling in love, right? So if you're going to say something, say it well.  And that's exactly what John Green does. He tells you a love story in honest, uncomplicated words that prove adolescence need not equate shallow, vapid existence. You can be profound, and relevant, and truthful in the bullsh_tless musings of a teenager.
0756404738|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have ever read.  I loved the first one, The Name of the Wind, but then this one, oh my!  For me this was a book that I walked around hugging to my heart cherishing the feel of the book knowing what I'm reading is feeding my deepest desire for a wonderful and delicious read.  I feel like a sweet-eater with withdrawls.  Please, Please, when will the third one come out?  I understand about taking time in order to write something worth reading - but, sigh.  I guess I'll just have to wait.  Patrick, please try to hurry.  Excellent!  Excellent!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Okay, when I saw the trailer for this movie, I thought it looked like it may be decent at best, so I decided to pass on it in theaters.  Now that it is out on DVD, I rented it.  You have no idea how much I am disappointed in myself that I didn't go see it on the big screen.  This movie was, to say the least, great!  It had me in the corner from the beginning and didn't let me out till the credits.  I would highly recommend this movie to anyone!!!
B005VTGB0S|4.0|#<br /><br />This product seems to do almost everything I'd want it to, but I have to subtract 1 star for the missing camera opening for the iPad 2, about which more at the end of this review.<br /><br />The cover offers pretty good protection against droppage onto a corner from six inches and also at 12 inches, but at 18 inches my friend Guillermo's iPad screen went black and a little bit of smoke came out of where the battery is.  He says it's my fault, but I plant to sue China, where this product is made.<br /><br />When the unit is in landscape orientation, you have a choice of viewing angles, which is handy.  When viewed in right profile, the top tips back, i.e., to the right, at any of three angles, those being 10 degrees, 20 degrees and 30 degrees off of vertical.<br /><br />When the unit is in portrait orientation, the cover can be opened to provide a second \\"leg\\" so it will stand up, but there are two drawbacks.  One is that the viewing angle cannot be changed, i.e., it is always vertical.  The other is that this orientation is much less stable than the landscape orientation.  In the landscape orientation the unit rests on a surface that's 7-5/8 inch by 10 inches, or 76.25 square inches.  In the portrait orientation the unit balances on a single L-shaped \\"line\\" that's 16 inches long but only about 13/128 inch wide, which is a surface area of only 1.625 square inches.  The landscape orientation thus offers 74.625 more square inches of contact (4,592.31% more) with the surface on which the cover is resting than the portrait orientation, which makes it less likely to slide or tip over if it's bumped or the underlying surface shifts.<br /><br />Furthermore, in the portrait orientation the center of gravity is obviously higher, which means it's even more likely to tip over.  Specifically, the center of gravity in the portrait orientation is at 5 inches (half of its height of 10 inches), whereas in the landscape orientation the center of gravity varies from 3.625 inches at the 10-degree angle to 3.1875 inches at the 30-degree angle, which means it's 27.5% to 36.25% lower.<br /><br />As noted above and by several previous reviewers, there is no opening for the camera on an iPad 2.  But as you might remember from certain of my own previous reviews, I like to test products by, among other things, seeing how well they hold up to being shot by a .22 caliber bullet from ten yards.  I'm pretty sure you can see that in testing this iPad cover this way, I did aim at, and hit, the spot where the camera would like to peek out.

B003WGVF4E|4.0|This adaptation of the book is very, very true to the original work. You can tell they payed close attention to details described by Hardy. Even much of the dialogue is the very same. This is Thomas Hardy's greatest tragedy and the adaptation is cast so well. This entire work is masterful!

B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I kinda liked the first one, but this one was a lackluster, uninspired, forced sequel that was obviously just a cash-in for fans of the first one. As an almost fan of the first one, I was beyond disappointed.
B0054U56B4|2.0|This installment of the series picks up after the eventual countdown to Lena's 16th B-day and the events there in.  Lena becomes a very emotional, withdrawn, irrational and off-putting character, to the point that her role dominates the book casting an unappealing pal over the content.  This installment has yet another countdown to \\"A MOON NIGHT\\" just like the first book. I can't say I'm very impressed with the repetition of yet -another- countdown. Very unappealing to do the same thing over and over.  All the characters, again, are 2 dimensional stills that don't stray from their pre-assigned roles, though there are a lot of mysteries that keep surfacing. One interesting exception is Ridley Duchannes, though she has very little page time and the authors generally gloss over her development. She is the only, and I mean this, the ONLY character to develop further beyond her initial role. Though Link does have changes as well his ROLE remains the same.  The authors throw away a number of 'rules' they had previously established casting away a lot of the world 'rationality' they tried so hard to build. I'm disappointed at the inconsistencies that diminish the hurdles the characters had to face. An example that I mention just to underline..: It seems casters can become mortal. It also seems mortals can become supernatural.  This, if you have read the previous book, rather neatly undercuts a lot of the difficulties between Lena and Ethan.  In essence, this book doesn't bring anything wonderfully new to the table and the inconsistencies break the flow of the story to the detriment of reader enjoyment.  Still, if you want a classic \\"forbidden love\\" sort of story, go nuts. Though as I said before, their love isn't THAT forbidden if one follows logical thought.  I honestly cannot recommend this read unless you're a diehard fan.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Wonderful game. Is great for kids of all ages. My boys are 8 and 6 they can beat most levels. I love it.
B00650SSWG|5.0|It's not a smart movie, but it's damned funny. Like, laugh out loud during every scene funny. I can totally relate to Jamie and her crazy life. Total guilty pleasure movie.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kills the time however the higher you get the more expensive the games are. I feel the more you play the games the more uninterested I am in playing.
B006C45MRE|1.0|This got so much buzz, I thought it would be better than it was. I was pretty disappointed, though. I'd hoped for more... everything. It just wasn't a very good movie.
1933865407|5.0|This book features amazing art by Bruce Timm feturing many women drawn in various mediums. At first, I thought it was going to be just feature random female drawings that Timm has done over the years but to my surprise it also includes a section of drawings on the many female heroes and villains of DC comics(Batgirl, Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, etc.), though I wish it had included his drawings of the Marvel ones too. Either way, this book is a must have and especially if your a fan of Timm's art.  P.S.  If you want, you can pay for the signed hardcover version for $100 dollars at the publishers website
B0039NK0LE|1.0|The movie is a good one, I've been meaning to watch it for a while. Unfortunately, I had to go elsewhere to watch it. Amazon's streaming is absolutely terrible. Video playback freezes every few seconds and completely stops every couple of minutes. After wasting $3 on a failed effort, I am moving on to streaming from other paying sources like Youtube Movies.
B000W8OM5Y|5.0|This has got to be my all time favorite movie.  There is everything in this film that movie goers go to movies for.  To me this is the perfect movie.  I grew up in England and Scotland but I never got to Ireland.  I heard all the folktales about William Wallace but there was never much in the history books about him.  At least not then.  He was as much a folk character as Paul Bunyan here in the states.  I have never really researched William Wallace but I will now.  I would like to know whether there was a real William Wallace and exactly what he did for England's independance.  How he went about achieving it.  This is Hollywood History and everyone knows that historical fact is sacrificed in favor of a good story.  There's nothing wrong with that if it provides good entertainment.  Which this movie is full of good entertainment.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who has not seen it.  If you like good movies, are a history buff, if you just dig Mel Gibson movies, or action adventure films this is for you.  It's the best movie out of the past 20 years IMO.  Get it, watch it, love it.  You won't be disappointed.  [[ASIN:B000W8OM5Y Braveheart (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]

B006E4QCXU|5.0|The quality is absolutely amazing on the Kindle Fire. I highly recommend it! Although people may say it bored them... Well, when u are waiting for a text back I get my Gravilux on. when u have nothing better to do I get my Gravilux on. when u are just listening to music Get your Gravilux on! Overall, its MESMERIZING. (like hypnosis in your pocket) :)
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This is a very cool game, it is addicting even my 10 year old loves it. I enjoy the story line and the graphics.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|Great game but it needs an update, so I would recon end it on a different tablet instead.  And that wasn't enough words so I need to say this too.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome - I love that my kids can play it with me and I don't have to explain every detail
B0054JZC6E|4.0|ook it is fun to un lock more games.  some games are hard. I like the plane game.  wonder if they have pac man.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Her album is a much needed relief from all the poppy/dance tunes out there. Don't get me wrong, I love pop/dance music, but sometimes you just need a break from it all. Anyway, her songs are meaningful, dreary, powerful,and yet still deep. I adore this album. Its been on repeat since I bought it a week ago. This album is very subjective. I think this album is gold, but if you like mellower beats with a vintage/deep voice behind them than you should enjoy this, but if that isn't your thing than this album will probably sound like melancholy, in a bad way, to you. I say it is worth giving a chance for those of you who are unsure about it. That is just my personal bias though, because she has quickly become one of my favorite artists. Hopefully she keeps up the good work.
B0061S073A|5.0|Our family (two adults, one seven year old) has had an iPad 2 for almost a year. My daughter loves the iPad but I was sorely disappointed to find that there was no way to create a \\"space\\" for her apps that she could access without interfering with my wife's and my use of the tablet. I purchased the KF mainly for my wife (who loves her Kindle) and myself and given the early reviews of the device I assumed it would be even more difficult to allow my daughter to use the Fire without close supervision.<br /><br />Surprise! Kids Place actually provides almost all of what I was looking for on the iPad. It enables me to create a passcode protected \\"home screen\\" where all my daughter's apps are displayed and accessed. She can use the KF without worry that we might end up with an unexpected refrigerator or set of lawn furniture showing up at our doorstep. Nor can she accidentally access the KF settings and accidentally modify critical settings.<br /><br />It's not a perfect solution. But that's not the fault of the developers of Kids Place. In addition to apps, I'd like to limit my daughter's access to her own books and music, for example. Given the current KF design, that's not possible. Access to books and music is \\"all or none.\\" And for those looking for a \\"nanny app\\" to censor internet access, this isn't it. Access to the browser is likewise \\"all or none.\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless, if you're looking for an app that enables a child to have their own \\"place\\" with their own apps (while preserving access to those apps to others without restrictions), Kids Place is a must have app.<br /><br />P.S. Since getting Kids Place I've noticed that the developers have continued to add features. One can, for example, turn off wifi access altogether when the app is used. If the KF is turned off while Kids Place is running, the app can be configured to open in Kids Place with a passcode required to exit the app. (Note: This works only if the KF is \\"put to sleep.\\" If it is completely \\"shutdown\\" and rebooted, Kids Place will no longer be running. To protect the KF in this scenario, set a passcode for the KF in settings.)<br /><br />(Edit: As the comments in response to this review indicate, I was apparently incorrect in saying that Kids Place has a \\"hole\\" in its security if the KF is rebooted. I've left the comment in place in the review only so the comments that follow make sense.)<br /><br />All in all, you cannot go wrong with a free app that does so much. The developers deserve a round of applause.
0446547654|5.0|Excellent book although the end is predictable.  Nicholas Sparks has a way of telling a story that I appreciate.  I like the way he develops characters as he introduces them into the story.
B005LZW8FO|1.0|Blue ray,DVD and Digital discs received as ordered. Big problem; I can not get them to play on my DVD player, as they are not suited for play in the UK.  I did manage to use the digital copy and watch the movie on my computer.  I just don't get this market segmentation and discrimination nonsense. I wanted to pay for my viewing but I can now understand why people buy pirate copies.  As for the film; it sort of left me cold. Brit Marling did hold me captive for most of the duration, even though the plot failed to exploit the concept of parallel worlds sufficiently. Over all a bit indulgent but firmly focused on this earth.  Perhaps if I had watched it on blue ray, or even on a large screen, my experience may have been different.  I still have a still of this as my computer wallpaper.

B004EPYZPS|4.0|I'm not a big fan of movies with kids as the main characters, but this one was pretty good.  Their interactions with each other, the adults, and their situation all seem realistic.  Although you don't really get a clear view of the creature involved, you don't really need to in order to feel the tension in this movie.  It's not the best \\"creature\\"-based movie I've seen, ([[ASIN:B004RE29PO Aliens [Blu-ray]]] has that distinction) but it was a pretty good one.

B0067QPVJ6|2.0|I never thought that John Carpenter's movie needed a remake.  I did NOT know, at the time, that this one is actually supposed to be a prequel.  Even so, I didn't think that was needed either.  And I was right.  The Kurt Russell version contained characters that I cared about, and graphics that - for that time - stood out.  This movie...none of that.  I didn't care about the characters at all.  Maybe because, except for the helicopter pilot,  I didn't know who any of the actors were.  I really only got interested at the end, where it goes into the tie-in with the John Carpenter movie.  I'd just skip this movie.  I wish I had.

B00062PN6I|1.0|I usualy respect the quality of behringer products I own several items of there's and my band uses there products and when I needed an extra set of headphones and didn't wanna pay a whole lot I chose to try a set of these beringer headphones and got them in good delivery shape and at a good speed opened them and used for an hour they sounded ok not the best but still good and when I took them off the vynal on the ear cup started pulling apart so I was disappointed in that and the other problem is they have a short coild cord and the way the 1/4\\" adapter jack screwed on instead of just sticking like most ment that a extension cable wouldn't work I tried but it wouldn't sound  So I'm not gonna be ordering any more of there headphones but I still believe there other products are still reliable for the price there good

B00009W0U4|5.0|There is a twist to this movie.. From start to end.. Very graphic rape scene, makes you think twice on not letting your girlfriend go home alone, men now in days are so careless like this guy.. Amazing movies, a thriller/ action and drama,... Great movie. I loved it

0385344228|5.0|The story starts quickly and the pace never drags. The tension builds in a slow, subtle crescendo to a finale that will leave the reader shaken. Long after finishing the last page, the story will haunt the corners of your mind. This is one you will not want to miss. Best seller is written all over this fine book. The characters are carefully developed and revealed a layer at a time. The plot is woven like a fine tapestry in rich colors. Yet through it all, there is a misplaced thread that shows itself from place to place until the story's unexpected climax and resolution that makes it all fit. Where it fits will be outside your comfort zone. Hard core FIVE STARS.

1451648537|4.0|I mean that title ironically.  Isaacson doesn't sugarcoat Job's often repellant, typically rude behavior. But he doesn't allow Steve's character flaws to overwhelm the wonder of the man's life.  Steve wasn't nice and he didn't care that people knew that.  Maybe he knew it was part of his mystique.  Job's gave into his passions for transformative technology and sometimes that passion wasn't pretty but we are all the better for it.<br /><br />The biography has the rushed feel of a book pushed into publication because of the subject's death.  There is little context, either of the other industry players, competing technologies or social forces that shaped Jobs and that he in turned shaped.  I got that he idolized Dylan and the Beatles.  That he had a Buddhist streak and a hippy, rebellious sensibility that clashed with the driven, money-making, competitive business man.  Isaascon beats the idea of Jobs seeing himself and Apple as standing at the intersection of technology and the humanities, to death.  But all of those qualities to the book feel like undigested sound bites that prevent the book from reaching deeper insight.<br /><br />Still, the author talked to everyone and his access to Job's provides an intimacy to the portrayal that brings him to life in the way that a biographer writing in another decade couldn't possibly hope to achieve.<br /><br />My \\"takeaway\\" is from Job's Stanford address which is to follow the work you love no matter what because just maybe that love -infused-work will make the world a better place.  And if you are also a \\"nice guy\\" all the better!
B006E4QCXU|5.0|I didn't think that the reviews and description of this app could possibly be accurate.<br /><br />How could just swiping your finger around on a screen of \\"stars\\" to make them move ben entertaining at all??<br /><br />Well, I was wrong.  It's almost a zen like experience once you truly get into it.  On my Kindle Fire, sitting in a dimly lit room, it really does almost put you into a trance as you watch the colors dance across the screen.<br /><br />Good stuff.

0061743526|5.0|\\"You have exactly two weeks to read this book and return a book report.\\"  My ninth grade teacher pushed oversized glasses up her nose as she spoke. Her black hair was piled in a loose bun on the top of her head. The knot swayed back and forth, and I could see grey roots at her temples. I opened the frayed cover. To Kill a Mockingbird. I read it in three days.  I never finished an entire chapter book before. I didn't know books told stories, thought they just rained parables full of words hard as hail I would never understand. I drew charcoal portraits of the characters, wrote an original play about Scout's adventures in my own hometown, laboriously typed it up on my Gramma's Underwood. The morning it was due I found a million saliva-coated pieces strewn across the kitchen floor. The family dog gave me an apologetic glance.  I told my teacher, could barely get the words past the lump in the throat. She didn't believe me. She gave me an \\"F.\\" As she spoke, I watched her morph into old dying Mrs. Dubose, my chewed pages the soft waxy petals and torn leaves of a ruined camellia bush. I squinted through tears, my hands on hips just like Scout. That's when I figured adults were cynical and tired, that they didn't stop to hear the expression of your eyes. I did the only thing Scout would do. I stole that dog-eared hardcover school edition and called it my own.  Four years later, I became some kind of Boo Radley - Mayella hybrid, pregnant, the victim of violent rape, a girl on the run. I stood in line at Employment Assistance day after day, filled out form after form, met with pasty-faced placement officers and nothing, just nothing happened. I walked parking lots looking for spare pennies, enough to buy a loaf of cheap bread. Women with money passed me, didn't see my hollow cheeks, didn't notice the only dirty maternity shirt I owned. I lay in bed each night, musty book against growing belly and prayed to a fading God to give me the steady wisdom of Atticus.  What I want todo now is slice my body in half so that you can peer inside, look at my guts and heart and frontal lobes and see what this book meant to me. It was everything, because it carried me through that pregnancy, sat beside me as I signed my newborn girl over to the state, held my hand during bad choices and man problems and kid emergencies and work traumas. I've lived a hundred thousand lives in the thirty years since I stole that book, wear Calpurnia's apron as I cook dinner, watch my own young boys steal Jem's defiance, Scout's tree-climbing joy, Dill's imagination.  Tonight I sit in a parking lot stealing wifi from a chain hotel. My mom waits in an Albuquerque hospital bed for blood clot surgery. The Book hides in my purse, every page splattered with pizza, with tears, with rock scrabble memory. I know just what scene I'll read as they wheel Mom to meet the surgeon. I'll open to the day Scout finally meets the darkness, the evening she sits in white light silence next to Boo Radley. My Mom will meet her fears as they drive the sleep needle into her arm. As for me, I meet my fears every damn day. But thanks to Harper Lee, I'm never alone.

B005KR6OBM|3.0|I ordered seasons 1-4 for my husband for his birthday.  We LOVE LOVE LOVE the show, but the quality of the DVD's that we received were not good at all.  The picture is very grainy (poor quality reproduction) on my LED flat screen.  I wish I could give it 5 stars, as this is the first time I've purchased DVD's from Amazon that were not of the best quality.  My past purchases have been top notch.  I think Amazon should check out some of it's suppliers and their products prior to allowing them to sell. They say you get what you pay for.  I paid over $100 for the 4-season set.  It should have been of better quality.  I also pre-ordered season 5 at the same time.  I hope it's of better quality than seasons 1-4.
B004SEUIWY|5.0|In conjunction with what the times must have actually been like when these stories were originally written, this is an excellent peek into the true minds of the Brothers Grimm and what shadows besieged the thought processes of those days.

076115728X|5.0|I happen to read this book to my nephews the other night. I immediately used my Amazon barcode scanner to find it for my own home.  It probably hit a little too close to home?

B001RXB4FY|5.0|I know I'm late to the party, but better late than never.  I listened to this album in its entirety for the first time a few months ago, and now, I can't stop listening.  One of the best hard rock / metal albums I've ever heard.  I describe these guys as one part Johnny Cash, one part Social Distortion, and two or three parts Metallica, all blended together, you get Volbeat.  FANTASTIC live band, and this album, although not their newest, is probably their best at least in my opinion.  Highest recommendation!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|great time killer, but I wish you got more points during games so you can buy more faster. in order to unlock more games you have to keep playing old ones to get the credits to get them. if you got more points then you wouldn't have to play the same ones so many times. overall, not bad
B0054EZ6I8|5.0|Most people have given a bad review, because they couldn't see the show at the time (about half a year ago). However, I saw the episode with no hassle. The episode itself is great.
1933952806|5.0|\\"Mastering\\" is an adjunct to the user's manual for the D7000, and a very good one.  It describes the controls and functions of the D7000 to a greater depth than the manual and provides recommendations for particular settings and the logic behind them. Errata (described in one of the 1-star reviews) were corrected in my copy.  The publisher has a PDF file describing the error and the correction for those purchasing the earlier printing ... how many publishers do that!?!<br /><br />The book will not make you a better photographer; that's not its intent.  But particularly for those moving up from a point and shoot digital camera or the relative simplicity of a 35mm camera, it is an excellent introduction to a very complex and capable DSLR.

B001QWBM62|4.0|I wrote review yesterday and gave 3 star because of \\"so so voice quality\\" and replay sounded like a \\"answer machine\\".  After I did more test, it turned out that my laptop computer has a so so quality speaker.  I have searched for a while and try to buy a very good audio recorder for my daughter she plays violin and piano. She may need to submit her work (electronic file) for audition. Needless to say, She needs a very good digital audio recorder. Anyway, I bought H4N after read many reviews here. The initial replay test was on the H4N built in speaker and my laptop.  The sound quality was \\"so so\\" and it sounded like \\"answer machine\\".  I posted my review after initial test. Later I did more test:  played Sibulus violin concerto CD on CD player which hooked with floor speakers. Then play the H4N recorded file on my desktop computer with much better speakers. I was totally blown away by the sound quality this time. I cannot tell the difference between the piece from CD and the piece recorded from H4N. Then I recorded my daughter's play. The replay is just like she was playing the music instruments. I am so happy I bought right product for my daughter.  Afte I posted my initial review yesterday, one reader suggested me to change the input format which I did. I changed it to 96kHz. Thank you very much for your suggestion. After more tests I did and got excellent result, I tried to edit my old review here and added my new test results. But some how, the new contents could not be added. So, I deleted old review and rewrite my review here (which included my old review contents).  I would like to give 4.5 star out of 5. Why not 5? As many other reviewers point out, the menu is not good written and organized. The printing on my menu is not even straight. Some pages were stuck together and I had to use knife to cut these pages open. It is like you fold a piece paper and the you need to cut the paper from the folding line.  Sean.
0385534639|3.0|I had very high expectations for this book, and boy was I disappointed! I loved the magical feeling and descriptions at the beginning. I loved the descriptions of the circus throughout, BUT I kept waiting to get to the \\"story.\\" The love affair in the book is flat and not brought to life. I wanted to fall in love with the characters but it was very difficult to feel connected to them. Their sayings/speech within the narrative are boring.  I read through the book sometimes quickly because I wanted to get to the suspense, but I was left waiting. I can't say I hated it, but it definitely fell short. Now that I think back I feel like this is a draft of the novel it could be.  I was left wondering what the heck it was all really about? I am sad. Wish I could have written a good review.

B004UXUUDA|4.0|I have long had a fascination for Nazi atrocities and the Holocaust in particular.  I believe that the subject should not be forgotten and that the more one knows about the horrors that were inflicted upon the European population during World War II, the more one can educate those who have not learned enough about it, or have chosen to ignore it.  My DVD collection includes a large number of documentaries concerning the Holocaust, as well as many dramas that are based on historical facts surrounding the subject.  So, when Amazon Vine offered me a copy of Sarah's Key, I knew this film would fit right in.<br /><br />Sarah's key concerns a French journalist named Julia, who is assigned to do a story on the 1942 deportation of thousands of French Jews to Nazi concentration camps.  Coincidentally, she is in the process of moving with her husband into her father-in-law's childhood apartment, and she stumbles upon information that the home was previously occupied by the Jewish Straznski family, who were among those forcibly evicted and sent to the camps.  Fascinated by this information, she begins to uncover more details about the family whose life her future father-in-law and his family supplanted.<br /><br />The shameful deportation from Paris was handled by the French police, who sheepishly took orders from the Nazi killers to round up the Jews.  The most affecting and painful moments in the film are the horrible conditions endured by the deportees as they await transfer to the camps.  Held in a stadium without food, water, adequate plumbing or any comfortable way to sleep, the families endure their misery in ways that will thaw the heart and amaze the observer, especially those who are used to the most modern comforts and conveniences.  At the center of the story is a young girl named Sarah, who hides her little brother in a locked closet to escape the Nazis, thinking the family will be returning shortly.  Although their plight is clearly precarious and their danger extreme, all her thought are directed at the idea of returning home to free her brother from the closet.  When she does escape and tries to rescue him, the tragic results are some of the most heartbreaking moments in the film.<br /><br />There is an additional twist involving Julia's attempt to find the grown Sarah, and the effects on Sarah's offspring, but I would recommend anyone whose interest has been held thus far to see the film and discover these aspects for themselves.  While some of the drama involved is relegated to what has become standard Holocaust fare, there are enough personal touches and little known historic facts to make Sarah's key a worthy entry in the crowded canon of Holocaust dramas.

Major tears!<br />A must have.

B003L77GG0|4.0|This is coming from a fan of the entire series. I have watched every episode, deleted scene, commentary, and other special feature from it. I even bought some of the music from it on itunes. When I got to this season, I couldn't wait to finally see superman. I was excited for the finale as I am sure any reader of this review would be.  I want to share my feelings about this season alone and hopefully it would help you decide whether or not to purchase it.  I would only recommend buying it if you are diehard like me. If you haven't seen ALL of the episodes before this season, I really mean ALL, you may not understand the ending. This season is about tying up all the loose ends from EVERY previous episode. The series had a lot of loose ends in it and you can tell in this season the writer's had to select their words very carefully to be consistent throughout the finale story. They pulled off the finale exceptionally well but if you don't have the big picture of the other seasons first, you may get lost and regret using your money buying this season.  If you watch movies and shows purely for entertainment purposes, you won't be disappointed. It is a very entertaining season. It has drama, humor, action, sexiness, and heartwarming moments. There are times where you will feel all emotions. There is one episode with Oliver Queen that I particularly think everyone would enjoy. I laughed so hard I am sure the neighbors a block away could hear.  This season is about darkness and love. Both are portrayed visually. I would not allow someone younger than 16 to watch this because some of moments are a little too grown up for kids any younger. That's my opinion though.  The bluray version, which I own, is probably not much better than the DVD version in terms of graphics and sound. You would be happy with either. I bought the bluray because I am a believer that bluray will last longer.  I had high hopes that it would go out with a bang. It was actually how expected it to be. I give it four stars because I had fun but really I don't think everyone who watches it will.

1451648537|2.0|Steve Jobs biography, seems crafted to represent its subject. The first third of the book, bordered on character assassination of the subject. I leafed through the book to re-review, and find specific examples. It's more of the interpersonal interaction description parts that seem slanted. Steve is overwrought. He is cold. He is unfeeling. He is duplicitous. Yet, towards the end of the book, he's become more important, and he's not as offensive to the author. He's gotten a stabilizing force in his life, his wife. But, he can still be mean, tyrannical. Yet, towards the end, he has frequent meetings with strong friends. There are people who show up to support him.  Then there's the business narrative of the book. Precise details of business deals, technologies. How the impact of what was developed seems surprising. Apple stores achieving record milestone in the time to reach the billion-dollar sales. Jobs, is followed, staying involved with all details, forcing collaboration. There's important stuff here for anyone interested in business. Unfortunately, we don't learn why Apple was successful. We have too much inside information on his interpersonal life, and not enough information on his business life.  The attempt to avoid the reality distortion field of Steve Jobs, created distortions in the book from the other parties. I felt frustration at the book, for portraying Steve as too negatively to start. Then too responsible for the successes of Apple. I felt that there was an effort to be fair, by being negative. And, I felt that the book, could have been stronger, if it had interpreted the personality, and the life. And, rather than trying to have a dichotomy, bad actor in interpersonal relations, and surprising business success; the book could have fused these, by filtering and understanding why the work was successful.  Let me give an example. In the chapter about the reality distortion field, the book has: \\"But even though Job's style could be demoralizing, it could be oddly inspiring.\\"  In the narrative of the book, it's certain that the mac management approach was demoralizing. But, inexplicable how it worked. It's odd that it inspired people. Character flaw, and bad actor, surprisingly good outcome.  That how I interpret the sentence, but it does not make sense.  Imagine this version of the sentence. 'Job's style was incisive, it was understandably inspiring.' That is likely too far the other way, but it assumes a bias for results from the behavior. I think that Steve Jobs must have been inspiring, and not oddly inspiring to achieve the success on the Macintosh. It is the narrative that thinks it is odd. And, even if Steve Jobs is a self contradiction as a person, the biography doesn't have to be a contradiction to present its subject. I felt that perhaps a later biography will be able to do a better job to analyze why he, and separately, Apple succeeded.

0439023483|5.0|Clearly I am a \\"Johnny Come Lately\\" to the Hunger Games.  The book has been in my Amazon cart forever.  When my eleven year old daughter came home with a copy from her book fair, I snagged it, started reading it, and couldn't put it down.  Mother of the Year? Yes, Yes, I know.  I did give the book back, I promise.<br /><br />Now for the Hunger Games.  Wow!  Set in?  Future? Past?  Who knows? I'm guessing it is set in the future.  It is definitely science fiction, young adult.  A teenage girl, Katnis (love, love, love the names in the one) is her family's breadwinner, literally.  In District Twelve, where Katnis lives with her Mother and her sister, life pretty well sucks.  There is not enough food to go around, Big Brother is lurking, and the only way to escape starvation is to fend for yourself within the confines of The Capital -  a fascist, socialist, communist-type nightmare of a government.  Still, Katnis has figured a way to work within the system, sort of.  Katmis and her friend Gale, hunt in the forbidden forest, just enough to get by.  They feed the wealthier folks in town who are so pleased with the food Gale and Katnis provide that they are willing to look the other way at the unlawfulness of the act.  On Reaping Day, (to be explained in a minute), Katnis and Gale share a moment where Gale suggests that they might \\"get away from here.\\"  Katnis shrugs off the suggestion, but a romantic suggestion is clearly evident between them.<br /><br />The Reaping is the annual day off where everyone from each of the 12 districts gathers in their town squares to hear the names called of both a girl and a boy  -two offerings to the capital as contributions to the Hunger Games, where they must fight to the finish, i.e.. the death of all the \\"tributes\\" until just one is left standing.  The 'games' are telecast live across all of the districts for their 'entertainment' value.  Katnis is not particularly worried about being chosen, but practically falls to her knees when her beloved sister, Prim's name is announced.  When she regains her voice she calls out to volunteer and take her sister's place.  Another boy form district 12, a kind boy that Katniss knows, is also selected and so the Hunger Games begin.<br /><br />The Hunger Games is a roller coaster ride of drama, terror, mystery, romance and at times pure outrage, but at all times, pure entertainment.  This first book of the The Hunger Games trilogy is a wonderful, enticing way to spend a few hours, don't miss it.im's name is announced.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|Drive completely caught me by surprise. Based upon the trailer and plot summaries such as the one above, I went into the movie thinking it was going to be just another typical action film along the lines of Fast and the Furious and The Transporter. I couldn't have been more wrong. Ryan Gosling plays a character only known as \\"Driver\\". By day he is a stuntman driver in movies and works on cars at a shop owned by his only/older friend named Shannon. At night he offers his services as a getaway driver to clients who need speedy exits after unsavory activities (such as robbing places). The opening sequence is set up by Driver's simple rules:<br /><br />\\"There's a hundred streets in this city. You don't need to know the route. You give me a time and a place, I give you a five minute window. Anything happens in that five minutes and I'm yours. No matter what. Anything happens a minute either side of that and you're on your own. Do you understand?\\"<br /><br />The chase scene that follows is unlike anything I've ever experienced before in an action car film. As the driver starts to navigate his clients through the dark streets with the police following behind, I was sitting there waiting for Ryan Gosling to start spewing cheesy one liners that Vin Diesel or Jason Statham and other action stars have become famous for. I was waiting for the suspenseful music to start pumping. I was waiting for---SOMETHING familiar to happen on the screen. Instead, the scene was done in almost complete silence, except for the sound of the police through his scanner and his own car radio. This technique built suspense way more than the normal high speed chases we see in movies. I found myself holding my breath at every turn. Talk about intense!<br /><br />While the opening sequence was an amazing chase scene, the rest of the movie plays out more like a drama with the main focal point on characterization. Driver is a lonely, introverted man that seems to only feel alive when he is doing dare devil stunts on movie sets or taking the risk of getting caught every time he accepts a \\"getaway\\" side job at night. The feelings he develops for Irene and her son are foreign to him--driver's background is never really revealed in the movie, but you get the impression that he had an unhappy childhood or rough upbringing that has molded him into the man we see onscreen.<br /><br />Although many people think the elevator scene is the turning point in the film (and in many ways it is) for me it's the motel scene with Christina Hendricks' character, Blanche. Up until then we know him as a lonely, under-the-radar type character. But this new development shows that he is an angry man, that under that cool exterior is suppressed rage just waiting to be unleashed.<br /><br />There were a few things going on in this film that had me a bit confused. However, I eventually made peace with these issues once I connected the dots. Driver had a distinct jacket with a scorpion emblem on the back. He rarely takes it off, even when it's covered in blood and he walks onto one of the movie sets in front of people. I at first thought that was a bit unrealistic but after watching this movie a 2nd time, I realize that Driver is not your normal man. I'm not saying he is supernatural or anything like that, but he definitely has some hero-esque qualities about him. Like Superman with his cape, Driver has his jacket.<br /><br />The music and font chosen for the credits were two other oddities that had me scratching my head at first. There was a lot of pop songs in the movie done in the style of the 80's or early 90's-- definitely not something you would expect out of an action film. The font at the beginning and end credits is done in cursive and is a hot pink color. Again, let me remind you, this is not your typical action movie.<br /><br />My only major gripe with this film is the very long periods of silence. I know this sounds weird and it's hard to describe what I mean but there are many scenes where Driver and Irene just stare at each other-- or Irene would ask him a question and it would take him forever to answer back. This goes on a lot during the film and may be annoying for some viewers who have short attention spans. I won't lie, it even annoyed me the first time around because I put the movie on real late at night and had trouble with keeping my eyes open during those scenes. BUT, I do GET it. I know this was purposely done by the director. There are moments of awkward silence and just when you think nothing is going on and let your guard down, all hell breaks loose. Someone is shot, or stabbed-- you get the point. So in a way, you are rewarded for your patience. This works for me but others may find this annoying.<br /><br />If you are looking for an action/drama that doesn't quite follow the normal Hollywood formula, then give Drive a chance. If you like art house films, then this is DEFINITELY a film you need to see!<br /><br />Mia at The Muses Circle (Like my review? Come check out more on my blog!

1594202842|4.0|I started this book this morning and was unable to put it down. Amy Chua provided an incredibly honest, sometimes brutally clear picture of what life was like in their house as her daughters grew up. While she sometimes went to the extreme--particularly at the moments even her own parents thought she was too intense--I found I mostly agreed with the spirit of her actions. Many other reviewers found her method of researching musical pieces and criticizing over her children's shoulder while they practiced too overbearing; I found it refreshing. In a day when children spend hours in front of the tv and/or indulged by parents who are more concerned with being a friend than a parent, I'm thrilled to see a parent willing to invest so much time and effort in their child. Her eventual revelation that her ultra-strict views on parenting aren't worth losing her younger daughter results in a more relaxed parenting style that is nonetheless involved and will probably guide Lulu to success.  I've long thought that children are much more resilient than adults give them credit for, and that the rise of self-esteem parenting is abhorrent. This isn't to say that a child's feelings of self-worth should be completely disregarded, but the idea that you can't tell your child they're being lazy and need to work harder for risk of making them feel bad about themselves is ridiculous. I identified with the story immensely because my own family was very similar to the author's--my older sister was the people-pleasing perfect older child, while I was the equally talented but much more stubborn younger child who would get in screaming fights with our mom over little things. My sister and I were both musicians who were pushed, but not nearly to the extent that Chua's girls were; honestly, I wish that we had been. In school, we were pushed for As because our parents knew we could get As; anything less was laziness and that wasn't tolerated. There were times I hated my mother just as Lulu hated hers. However, at age 21, I now have two college degrees and will receive my third in April, and I'm incredibly grateful for the pressures my parents put on me to get me to this point. Amy's eldest daughter has expressed a similar thankfulness for her mother's severe style and I'd be willing to bet Lulu will get to that point, too.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|If I had to sum this movie up in two words it would be Indie Cool.  Ryan Gosseling made a terrific comeback in doing this movie.  He was the embodiment of the strong silent type.  Not alot said from him, but then again it wasn't needed.  I do wish there was a bit more background on his character and driving action.  Overall it was a good movie!

B0052UZIFA|1.0|The Google play store has the 1.3.16 version of this game, yet for Amazon we haven't had an update since 2011. Utter crap if you ask me.
B000VDDWDS|5.0|Those who give this movie 1 star for being boring:  There is a lot to this movie if you watch.  You're just too used to action movies with nothing more subtle than a sledge hammer between the eyes.  This has subtley and action.  Apparently, that's something many can't have in the same movie.  Sort of like chewing gum and walking at the same time.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|As I watched this film I thought, ahhh finally.. a movie like the old school films of the mid-seventies and early eighties and done so without plagiarizing.  This film occupies its own space and it is a space that is quiet, patient, sultry and smoldering.  Gosling is perfect and carries the desired soft spoken intensity that I am sure Refn sought.  When the violence comes it is a surprise but then almost somehow absorbed by the poetic tenor of the film.  I love this movie. It is a beautiful package. I wanted to watch it again immediately after it was over.

B0060AY6FO|2.0|I did not like this sequel at all.  I still have about 75 pages to finish but I am struggling to get through it.  Too much repetition of the original and not written with the same flavor and depth of Austen's Pride and Predjudice.  Darcy seems weak at times and he should remain a hero and Elizabeth does not seem like the same person either.  I haven't read any other P.D. James books and may not bother.
B002PDGTI2|3.0|She is a textbook case of how a controversial figure can go from interesting to annoying. Her determination to \\"rule the world\\" as she infamously told Dick Clark on one of final seasons of American Bandstand. Off of her debut, \\"Lucky Star\\" was faintly irresistible. Then came the first deluge of hype with \\"Like a Virgin\\" as she wiggled like a retarded python on the MTV Awards......so 80s. There would be the occasional \\"Dress You Up\\" that grabbed my attention. The soul of \\"Papa Don't Preach\\" had some degree of honesty. However, it also got caught up in her growing arrogance. She \\"Vogue\\"d into the new 90s decade shamelessly stealing from the grand underground pageant balls highlighted in \\"Paris is Burning\\", never paying homage to the bold gay subculture from which vogue-ing was borne. That made her even more irritating.  As \\"The Immaculate Collection\\" dominated music charts around the world, I increasingly lost interest. When she resurrected herself with various trendy singles, only \\"Ray of Light\\" proved remotely interesting. Like Michael Jackson, she made the music video an event which was usually better than the songs they were suppose to be promoting.  By the time we got to \\"Celebration\\", there was little reason to do so. So like the 80s, with memories of greed and the destruction of the Big \\"A\\", you're thankful that those times are far behind us. Coming from the ragged streets of the Motor City, she was dying faster than the automobile industry did. Acquiring an English accent so unrealistic, she sounded like she copied it from her time being trapped in Heathrow for an extended weekend. Trying desperately to be accepted by English society, street trash with money could only be transformed into, well, street trash foolishly looking for acceptance from royals that saw her no more than the Jezebel she always was. She recently told MTV that she has lost interest in acting, once again disingenuously trying to be a so called actress when her best roles was as pretendingto be talented as she did when she first assaulted us in the early 80s.

1439170916|5.0|With the progression of medical research, man has been able to successfully eradicate diseases such as small pox and polio, prevent the previously fatal consequences of measles,influenza and HIV, among others, but while progress has been made in cancer treatment and research, it still remains an illness that strikes fear in the hearts of many.  This biography traces cancer, from its appearance more than four thousand years ago and the attempts to understand it, control it, prevent it and cure it that continue into this Century. While it is clearly written with compassion, the author doesn't pull any punches with details on the ravages wrought by the vicious disease and some of the drastic attempts at putting a stop to the aggressive invasion of these mutant cells in the human body.  It's fascinating, horrifying, saddening and yet hopeful. It gave me a better understanding of the disease in all its forms, and more importantly, I'm comforted that there are organizations and individuals still determined to find better treatments leading to perhaps a cure in the near future.

0811879542|5.0|---------------------------------------------------------<br />\\"Press Here\\"<br />Written & Illustrated by Herve Tullet<br />(Chronicle Books, 2011)<br />---------------------------------------------------------<br />This is an absolutely brilliant work, which reminds us of the simple imaginative power of books. The text is in the form of a voice, instructing readers in various steps that \\"change\\" the pictures in the book, and praise them for following instructions. Like the old Sesame Street \\"There's A Monster At The End Of This Book\\" story -- where Grover pleads with readers to not turn pages, etc. -- \\"Press Here\\" turns readers into collaborators when they make the choice to play along with an obvious fiction, that the book is \\"speaking\\" to them, and that their actions have an effect on what happens in an already-printed story. It's a kind of make-believe that will strike a rich, resonant chord for many readers, young and old, a trick that taps into a deep creative wellspring, the kind of uninhibited playfulness we shared when very young, but often discard as we mature. Plus, it's delightful to have such a low-tech approach work so well in an era when we count on computers and elaborate special effects to provide our entertainment. I loved this book, my kid does too, and chances are you will, as well. Highly recommended! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain childrens' book reviews)

B0064J6OMO|1.0|First, why would Amazon allow 14 year olds to watch and review any film rated R? Especially this one! I just don't understand why movies today insist on using such foul language, involving a child no less, as in the scene around 34:20. A child being bombarded with the F!!! and Whor! words. How is it possible a parent would allow their daughter to be involved in such an adult film? I am really mad about this film but am even more concerned that more people are not voicing outrage over this garbage being spoon fed to our culture. Amazon should post the age of people reviewing movies for I will bet most good reviews here, are not from mature adults or are paid reviewers. Think about it folks ... Is this vulgarity really what you want?
B000053GTF|5.0|Celine has a beautiful voice and these videos show also here beautiful form under all different themes....Celine is my favorite aritst and I love her...I loved the videos: Theme from Beauty and the Beast, Misled, If Walls Could Talk, and the rest of the videos too...none that I did not like....great video for Celine fans and for those who are just being introduced to Celine Dion...:)

0307352145|5.0|Subtitled \\"The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking\\", Susan Cain's Quiet takes us on a journey through history and into the present, understanding why exactly introverts and the skills that they have are devalued in present day American culture. We also take a look into the brains of introverts and whether it's nature or nurture that turns some of us inward and others outward. She then offers helpful hints on how introverts can deal with modern careers and find space for themselves in a world that demands meetings and presentations as indicators of business success. Rounding out the book with interviews and advice for parents with introverted children, Cain has provided an interesting study of many different aspects of \\"sensitive\\" personality types.  I am decidedly an introvert, and I imagine most people reading this blog are too - in general, we are people who need space away from the world to recharge our batteries, people for whom speaking in public is a struggle, and who essentially work best on our own. Cain offers a lot of definitions and also provides a little list towards the start of the book to help readers identify if they are actually introverts - she also takes pains to stress throughout that many people actually have aspects of both introversion and extroversion. This is not a black-and-white science.  I found it quite inspiring to read about how many introverts have changed the world. As an introvert who has learned to cope surprisingly well (I'm always shocked when someone doesn't think I'm shy, and it happens more often than you'd think), I definitely felt refreshed by the knowledge that lots of other people do better with space to contemplate. The history of the subject was also interesting, especially the ways different cultures handle these personality types. It's not surprising that more Americans count themselves extroverts than Chinese - part of it is definitely culture emphasizing ideals. But the other part is genetics, andeven though we can learn to cope quite well, her strategies gleaned from interviews and personal experience are thoughtful.  I did feel a little bit at times that she swung a little too far in the direction of introverts - but given this is a book attempting to empower us, I can't be too surprised at that. The other part I (obviously) did not find useful as a childless woman was the advice for children, and having read it I'm not sure it would have helped me as a kid. But I'll leave that up to parents to decide - life isn't easy for shy children, and helping them accept their personalities while giving them the skills to succeed can never be a bad thing to attempt.  Quiet is a worthwhile read for both introverts and extroverts - so the former can feel much more at home in their own skin and so extroverts can learn more about life on the other side of the divide. And if you're in between, even better.

B005ER6SNM|5.0|We heard alot about this movie so we decided to purchase the uncut version.  We figured if we were going to watch vile disgusting acts then we might as well watch it all.  So it arrived and we watched it and we were rather surprised.  From what we heard about the movie (newborn sex, necrophilia ect.) we were just expecting it to be a series of gore scenes put together one after another simply for shock value.  However, the movie is rather interesting.  It has a plot, good acting, nice camera work and doesn't reveal everything to the viewer at once.  The viewer finds out what happens to Milos through a series of flashbacks and film he finds.  I understand it is suppose to be a political statement but it also makes a good antidrug film.  Things went downhill for Milos when the drug was injected into him.  The film does have some scenes that will make people wince.  It didn't phase us because we already knew what to expect and we have seen quite a bit of \\"disturbing\\" imagery.  Also, it is just a movie and it has a way of drawing in the viewer.  Throughout most of the movie we were more curious about what happened and what was going on with Milos and his family than oogling at the gore.  I know that might sound odd but compared to watching Three Guys and a Hammer this wasn't that gut wrenching....big difference between reality and fiction.

0425221806|5.0|I've read this book five times now and it still blows me away every time I finish it. This was the first book I'd ever read by Dean Koontz and after I read it I became a huge fan of his and have read almost every other one of his books.  The book has a variety of characters and mixes in several different genres: Horror, suspense, science fiction, romance, crime and thriller. The story starts out with a middle aged depressed man named Travis who stumbles across an intelligent and loving golden retriever but is chased by a terrifying monster hybrid called the outsider. The novel consists of Travis meeting up with a woman named Nora and together they protect Einstein(The dog) and run from the Outsider and government agents looking to cover up the experiment that created the two.  The book is so thrilling and fast paced and suspenseful that anyone who loves fiction will enjoy this. This is undoubtably Koontz's best work to date and it deserves to be called a classic.

B005WGBQ9G|1.0|Honestly, I am a Zombie book and movie Fanboy. And I loved the 1st Season of The Walking Dead.  Unfortunately, the second season and I am addressing the entire season here now as I don't have the time or inclination to rate each episode, IMHO, completely looses the thread of the Zombie genre'. Zombie books and movies are about Zombies chasing, threatening, and dining on the \\"survivors.\\"  This is what made Season One great. Season two, has almost none of this at all. No heart rending turnings of bite victims, not brains or viscera getting dined on, few head shots, screams, terror or any of the things that are great about Zombies vs. survivors.  I am hopeful that this is just the sophomore blues for this series, and it attains the entertainment value of the 1st season.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is by far one of my most favorite N.Sparks books. It was a constant read and I hated when I had to put it down. It's a beautiful story that will tug at your heart strings and make you think. Another beautiful story that he shares that is a must read for those who enjoy being captivated and sucked in to an amazing story of love as most of all, courage.

0525425578|2.0|I decided to try Grisham again and read The Associate. Story was gripping, but the ending was terrible. So I picked up Theodore Boone: Kid Lawyer. Good story, but the ending was so much like The Broker:  case gets solved at one level, but the good-guy-wins never really plays out, and there's still a creepy bad guy lurking out there who could wreak havoc on the hero, with no resolution.  How did Grisham's editor let him get away with this?! (or maybe the editor insisted on it?) Even I could have written 10 more pages in each novel and crafted endings that would have raised the very mediocre Amazon ratings up to 4.5 or better. So simple to make these books better, but they leave the reader hanging like a lame set-up for a sequel.  Instead of gripping me with a yearning for more, they make me want to swear off Grisham for 5 more years.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is so simple at first it appears to be too simple.  But we cannot put it down.  It is a perfect game for those times you want a diversion for a few minutes.  Beware though a few minutes could turn into a lot longer before you put it down.
B00632HWOG|3.0|If you want to fully manage your yahoo mail, this app falls short.  It only displays the most recent 10 messages and the messenger feature doesn't work on the Fire.  It is a good app for keeping you up to date, but difficult to use if you get a lot of emails to that address.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|Wow. I came on this movie by chance late at night on the SYFY channel, and my imagination was caught and my attention kept from the very first scene. Why have I never heard of it before?!? The premise alone is intoxicating: vikings, alien beasts, space travel, worlds colliding with worlds colliding with worlds...!!!  I for one loved the cinematography; it was dark and rich with deep saturated color. The Viking world was painted vividly with the costumes and custom - the fight scenes were a bit gruesome for my taste, but well choreographed.  Were there historical discrepancies? sure, but it's a MOVIE. Was some of the script-writing a bit cheesie? Yep. But Jim Caviezel (however you spell it) brought his usual emotional depth to his character - think \\"tortured/sensitive\\" warrior-and Sophia Myles was a great foil --beautiful and tough without being super-annoying. Were there some plot holes? Yes. For example, **SPOILER** if the beasts were all killed by fire originally - why did the fire trap fail? but overall the writers/director pulled me into the world of the script and the actors kept me there, and I didn't want to leave.
B005K17RU0|5.0|very accurate always seems to be up to date and its very reliable by popping up in my kindle task bar.

B001AR0D4A|1.0|Tried to play this blu-ray on PS3 and it kept crapping out on me towards the end of the movie.  Had to reboot PS3 several times while watching the movie, made for a very stressful experience, unenjoyable.  The movie seemed like a good adaptation of the short story but the DVD/blu-ray experience of it continuing to hang up towards the end of the movie ruined the viewing experience.  Maybe the lo-def DVD version might be better without the ill-converted blu-ray format getting in the way of the experience.
B006PKQQJS|5.0|may be write, but it installed great for me (on the Kindle Fire). I give this game 5 stars because of its great graphics, challenging levels, and hours of fun! For anyone that loves time management games such as Diner Dash, you will love this game. It is definitely worth the $1.99 that you have to pay for it. I love it! :D

B0038P59A0|5.0|I've been wanting to watch this for awhile. I'm not a big movie watcher, and there are few that catch my interest enough to rent and actually watch much less buy. This is one that will probably make it into my permanent library.  Enjoyed every minute, and will be anticipating watching the sequel. As noted, I seldom sit through an entire movie...but I did this one..with few pauses :-).  And I watched it on my new Galaxy Tab. :-)
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I have just left gotten home from my second viewing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo in theaters. Just as amazing as it was the first time, this movie combines superb directing, art direction, musical score, and acting for a complete package that delivers.  When I heard that Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross were scoring this film, I became interested in the movie instantly. This spark was fueled insanely by the first teaser trailer that was released in the Summer of 2011. After seeing the trailer, I went out and got the book, read it, and was insanely excited to see how it would be brought to life. Months passed, and after reading the book and listening to the full 3 hour score multiple times, the movie came out. What I watched was nothing short of a mesmerizing, dark, immensely detailed story that captivated my imagination. The entire cast gives fantastic performances, but nobody delivered like Rooney Mara did in bringing Lisbeth Salander to life. Her portrayal displayed how I viewed Ms. Salander, as described by the book, with about 100% accuracy. In regards to comparing this film to the Swedish film, I will speak from an unbiased viewpoint whereas I have read the book and seen both movies. When it comes down to it, the American film is by far more accurate to the book.  There's a few minor changes and a decently major change that improved (in my opinion) the movie's resolution, but other than that, a very faithful representation of the original story. All in all, a great story, great performances, and an amazing screenplay all add up to a perfect 5/5 rating from me.

B001QGRIO8|1.0|The final volume in the Twilight series is perhaps the worst of the lot--and that's quite a statement, considering just how awful the first three books in this wretched series are. By now, the pathetic Twilight universe is well known to all who care to know about it, so I won't waste any time--or indulge in any type of masochism--by describing the characters or recounting the plot, such as it is. The \\"action\\" in this unnecessarily bulky novel consists of about 70 pages of wedding/honeymoon anxiety (with Bella droning on endlessly about how beautiful and radiant her vampire groom is), 280 pages of an ironically prolonged rapid gestation (much of it told from Jacob's point of view--and if you think Meyer sounds ridiculous writing as a lovestruck teenage girl, just wait until you get a load of her lame attempts to sound like a lovelorn teenage werewolf--um, excuse, me--I mean, shapeshifter). The remaining 370 pages or so revolve around the early childhood of Bella and Edward's progeny, the unique--and uniquely annoying--half-vampire, half-human Ren&eacute;smee, which itself is perhaps the single most ridiculous character name in all of printed literature. The alleged conflict that propels the remainder of the narrative is predicated upon the Volturi's misunderstanding of Ren&eacute;smee's nature, and it results in one of the most anticlimactic climaxes ever put to paper--a battle between a \\"mist\\" and a \\"shield\\"--heart-pounding stuff. \\"Breaking Dawn\\" is a vapid, poorly written, and absolutely ridiculous tale, and I am definitely the worse for having read it. I take solace in the fact that it marks the end of the series, and I will never have to read another Twilight novel again. Ever.

B005TMSN4E|5.0|The Nikon 1 Series provides a small capable camera that can be paired with extremely small lenses (10, 10-30 and 30-110) that provide excellent optical performance in a package that's extremely small and lightweight.  For those times when size and weight are not as critical as other factors, this handy piece of gear provides access to all those \\"F\\" lenses in the world.  I bought the J1 as a gift for my wife (with 10, 10-30 and 30-110 lenses) since it's got sufficient IQ and speed for her photographic needs, but is small and light enough that she'll carry it along.  The FT-1 was bought primarily for her to use with the new 50/1.8G that sees little time on my D7000 (75mm is an awkward focal length for me).  On the J1 the 50 becomes a 135/1.8 and has proven to be an excellent portrait lens and useful \\"fast-tele\\" for her, while still being relatively light weight and ergonomic.  The FT-1 works just as advertised and is very solid and well crafted.  The only rub is that the Nikon 1 firmware did not originally support the FT-1 and had to be updated, which took about an hour of time reading the instructions, doing the download and swapping cards, etc.  Well worth it.  Now I just have to keep my wife away from my 300/4 AF-S and the new 85/1.8G when it arrives.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|I remember when Jurassic Park first came out. It was probably the last true blockbuster of the modern era. Everybody loved the special effects and seeing realistic dinosaurs on the big screen (remember, this was the FIRST time a movie had realistic dinosaurs as opposed to Godzilla-like monsters). But what really made this movie click was the characters. It's a perfect mix of lovable and oddball characters. I love the subtle character development over the course of the movie, particularly with Dr. Grant and John Hammond. You actually do care if they get eaten and you want them to survive.  Jurassic Park is also the only time I've ever thought that a movie was better than the book. The book was more like a B-rated horror story with flat characters and more violence. The movie by contrast embraces the wonder of seeing dinosaurs on the big screen and is much more fun to watch. It was already an instant classic when it came out and I predict it'll be so even years from now.  Sadly, these are the elements missing in the two sequels. The characters there were utterly forgettable. It was just tragic and unnecessary seeing that Drs. Grant and Sattler didn't get married in the third movie. Ironically, the latter two movies were more like the Crichton novels than the first movie ever was.
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|A Discovery of Witches had me hooked out of the gate; the character of Diana was likable and the storyline was engaging. I read the first chapters of the book quickly and greedily. I burned through pages, impatient to learn what would happen next in the tale. Then suddenly, for some unknown reason, that just changed. I don't know if the author took some time off and picked the story up later (perhaps after taking up with a conservative religious group that espouses the glory of female subservience), or if she got another editor to give her feedback, or if she just ran out of energy. The storyline began to drag heavily and become bogged down in numerous places. The tenor of the tale became sexist to the point of absurdity. The pro-celibacy moral undertone threaded through the book was similarly hard to tolerate, and contributed nothing positive to the overall story. The decline of the storyline mirrored the decline of the character of Diana herself, initially so energetic, strong, intelligent, and edgy. At approximately the same point in the book, both became boring, lethargic, weak, and absorbed with the mundane. The initial chapters of the book were well written and enjoyable to read, yet the rest of the novel failed to live up to the promise of those first pages. I expected a great deal more out of this book. I strongly dislike aspects of this novel, and will avoid works by this author in the future. I regret buying this book, which are words I have not uttered in years, since I once mistakenly purchased a book written in Thai.

B001E75QH0|5.0|I recently rewatched the Indiana Jones movies on the 30th anniversary of Raiders' release and I was shocked at how well it's held up over the years. I always remembered them as fun and exciting, but now I can appreciate all of the B-movie serial references and the subtle humor. Even the special effects still look good - a lot better than most of the CG stuff that comes out nowadays. This DVD has a pretty darn good version of the movie with nice clean images, crisp colors, and sharp contrasts - although I can only hope it comes out blu-ray soon!

B000000OAN|5.0|QUEEN was one of those bands that stretched boundaries and did what they wanted to do. VERY eclectic, experimental, totally fearless and nearly unclassifiable, they forged their own musical path, whether people liked it or not. I loved everything they ever wrote! A NIGHT AT THE OPERA was / is QUEEN's masterwork of strange, beautiful rock / opera / etc., etc., and the album that launched them into the upper cloud layer of rock and roll history. A patchwork of musical styles that somehow fits together perfectly! Genius!...
B001UGB1X8|1.0|It was a challenge forcing myself to see it through to the end.  Before you think some of the bad reviews here \\"just don't get it.\\"  Let me warn you.  This movie is not clever, creative, complex, French or any of the other things that may inspire such mixed reviews.  It's just plain boring.  Nothing happens.  I am utterly befuddled at all the comments lauding the great acting.  Jones was fine but some of the supporting and secondary cast sounded like they were reading cue cards.  Just awful.
B000001ESF|5.0|RUSH put out many good / great albums during the 70s. 2112 is my personal favorite, due to it's futuristic, sci-fi adventure storyline. From beginning to end, this is RUSH at the top of their intelligent, hard-rocking game. Basically a concept album, 2112 is meant to be listened to in it's entirety. For me, it never gets old...

B000002J09|5.0|Personally, I hope to never hear STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN ever again. Do I hate the song? No, I simply have it burned into my brain forevermore! Bits of it seem to float in and out of my memory, whether I want them to or not. Nope, I'm good. It's the rest of LED ZEPPELIN IV that I still need to listen to. BLACK DOG, ROCK AND ROLL, MISTY MOUNTAIN HOP, etc., never seem to get old for me. GOING TO CALIFORNIA reminds me of my teen years, bringing a smile whenever I hear it. WHEN THE LEVEE BREAKS is my favorite song, and might be my favorite ZEPPELIN tune, period. LZ4 is an essential recording, one of those classics from the 70s that belongs in every rock collection...
B002G1YPH0|5.0|I installed this to cool my I7 2600k cpu I had been running with the stock heat sink for about the last 3 months.  My cpu temps were in the 80's under full load. I wasn't even over clocking my cpu. With this cooler they dropped down to the lower 50's under full load.  It is a very large heat sink.  My motherboard is an asus p8z68 deluxe/gen3.  I switched the fan on this cooler to the other side because I felt it would have been too close to my ram chips.  Technically I could have left the fan where it was.  I wish I had bought it when I was building my computer as I had to remove the motherboard to install this.  It fits quite well in a cooler master haf 932 case.

It sounds like Lou recorded his vocals in to a hand-held recorder with metal background music. I don't know who did the audio but it's awful.<br /><br />I like both era's of Metallica (the old head-banging stuff and the more modern commercial slightly less head-banging type stuff) but I pray to God that this is not going to be repeated.<br /><br />Save your money. Don't even download it from a bit torrent site. IT'S NOT WORTH IT! If you get caught downloading it, Lars might come to your defense for being willing to at least listen to this garbage.
B003YDUUH8|5.0|After Robbie's last album, 2009's Reality Killed The Video Star, I began to lose interest.  It lacked the bite, humor, and energy of his past work and felt too polished.  But after reluctantly ordering this deluxe boxed set 2 years after its release, my faith is renewed!  A perfect reminder of Robbie's achievements in the pop-rock world!  I already had every hit presented here, but the 3rd disc of b-sides, 2 discs of videos, and 1 concert disc make this purchase worth the price and then some.  There are many hard-to-find-in-the-U.S. treasures here, some of which I had never heard of.  Nice color-photo booklet, great audio & video quality, and further proof that something is wrong with the American music industry when a global popstar who has been cranking out hits for 15 years is still relatively unknown in the good ol' USA.  Of course there are always small complaints when it comes to collections like this, so here are mine:  The 3 DVD's included here are in PAL format, which means I can only play them on my computer- not on my DVD player.  The few \\"bad words\\" Robbie uses on some tracks have been edited out.  Whose ears are we protecting here?  Come on.  Some liner notes, a career summary, or interview in the booklet would've been nice.  All tracks are in reverse-chronological order, from 2010 to 1993, which I find frustrating.  Aside from that, I love this collection and recommend it to anyone who loves (or used to love) Robbie!

0937381888|5.0|This book is the best initial reference you need to learn home brewing.  It is very well written and explains everything you need to know about brewing your first extract batch all the way to all-grain brewing.  It is a very easy read and discusses common pitfalls and the science behind them.  The author explains everything in just the right amount of detail.  I highly recommend this book as a first choice.
B0060ANP10|5.0|What an incredible record!  It's called Winter's come back album, but in my mind, come back from what?  He remains top notch to this day.  I bought this on vinyl when it first came out.  When I went looking for it on CD a couple years back, I found it was out of print, but since that time, it's been restored to it's gutsy glory with bonus tracks.  Besides the title track, Winter takes the Stones Classic, Silver Train, and makes it his own.  I much prefer his version to that of the Glimmer Twins!  Surprisingly, though, my favorite song remains 'Ain't nothin' to me'.  As a country romp, it's so much fun as Johnny tries to warn some poor Romeo that he's playing with fire!  I actually got to see Winter when he was touring for this album.  Actually leaned on the front of the stage right by the left speaker!  What an amazing show that was! The Winter bros are American classics!
B0061JPYX2|3.0|I was an Amy Winehouse fan long before many heard about her and long before her struggles garnered her more press than her talent.  I am conflicted about this release.  On the one hand I am thrilled to own it.  She is forever silent now.  Her awesome talent forever suspended in time as it was.  On the other, there are a few disappointments and while it pains me to write this, it's a fair comment.  Had she not died I doubt some of this would ever have been released.  Still, there are a couple of magnificent tracks that make me stand still.  On the whole, I'd rather have this in my collection than not.  Even the tracks that are not up to her brilliance are far better than a lot of the drivel out there today.  Amy, I hope you are at peace.
B000025RX4|5.0|This is what blues pop sounds like.  Catchy hooks with a soulful refrain.  This is Winter with Rick Derringer, including the first version of Rock and Roll Hoochie Coo.  They played this album during lunch at my high school, which actually introduced me to alot of great music.  This is an excellent album to defang  the 'blues' to those who may be turned off by some of the early players.  It leaves you hungering for more.  Not as pure as Winter's first for Columbia and not as rocky as Second Winter, it's got some great tunes, starting with 'Guess I'll go away', 'Am i really here' & 'No time to live' are mellow tracks that would fit nicely on an AC formatted radio station, it they had the nerve to play them.  'Look Up' is a general anthem for the baby boomers coming of age without being pretentious, and 'Let the Music play' reminds us that these songs are the soundtrack of our youth.  Columbia later coupled this record with the follow up Johnny Winter And Live, which i wish they'd expand, but i guess they figured you'd get the idea-this album may be 'mellow' but winter and co could still knock you down and lay you out when they hit the stage!

B002N4DZ58|4.0|Despite my having acquired it on its appearance, I have held off reviewing this &#34;Last of the Studio Recordings&#34; to let the dust settle and digest its worth. I have been re-visiting a good few &#34;Tristan&#34; recordings recently and have re-discovered my attachment to semi-forgotten accounts like Knappertsbusch's 1950 live Bayreuth account, Karajan's live Bayreuth performance from 1952 and the classic Furtw&auml;ngler set. So where does this one fit in? Warning bells go off when I find that a recording languishes on my shelves or is the last to be selected from a range on offer, and I realised that I needed to uncover my subconscious reluctance to listen to this recording first.<br /><br />Well, that faint lack of enthusiasm does not primarily stem from any problem with the orchestral playing or conducting. It's in beautiful sound, the Royal Opera House Orchestra plays magnificently and Pappano has a vision for the work, which is to bring out the burnished glow and languorous beauty of the score without sacrificing tension. A lot of the time it works, the overture heaves like the ocean, the stately chords heralding Tristan's ominous appearance when summoned by Isolde to leave the helm and present himself as &#34;die Sitte&#34; (according to Isolde) demands are grand and ominous, the love potion music just before the hectic conclusion of Act I pulses and yearns. Pappano manages to sustain the necessary poise and poignancy in the Act III Prelude - always a difficult challenge. Orchestrally, it is a concept which is nowhere near as magisterial as Furtw&auml;ngler achieves or as passionate as Knappertsbusch's or Karajan's concept but it is of a piece in its Lieder-like attention to detail and commands respect.<br /><br />No, the problem lies in my response to the voices themselves, inevitably up against others of legendary status. Nina Stemme has a big, vibrant voice and certainly conveys youthful passion. Unfortunately, at emotional moments at high volume that vibrancy can spill over into a marked tremolo or even an incipient wobble in a role which calls for absolute steadiness. Hence at key moments such as &#34;Er sah mir in die Augen&#34; she cannot maintain a firm line and defaults into a thin trembling sound which lacks intensity; &#34;mild und leise&#34; is powerful and has the right, rapt, &#34;otherworldly&#34; quality but is wobbly. And while she can certainly do anger, desperation and scorn, she has not the experience to bring out biting irony.<br /><br />Otherwise, Stemme's co-singers are afflicted by what I can only describe as a kind of blandness. Mihoko Fujimura has a fine, steady mezzo of virtually faultless intonation but she brings little individuality to her Brang&auml;ne and her voice is often indistinguishable from Stemme's. Olaf B&auml;r lacks low notes, barks a bit and is frankly a bit of bore - always a danger with this puppy-dog role. I remarked of Ren&eacute; Pape's recent Wagner recital that he had lost a lot of the vibrancy the voice had in his youth and again here as King Mark his top notes are weak and the tone is comparatively grey here, with neither the heart-breaking intensity nor the effulgence of voice that such as Talvela or Ridderbusch find in the role. Having said that, his &#34;Tod denn alles!&#34; and &#34;Erwache!&#34; right at the end is rather good; he finally finds some real depth of feeling. Villazon gives us a lovely, impassioned cameo as a virile Young Sailor; let's hope he has recovered from his recent vocal trials. I can just about tolerate Ian Bostridge here as the Shepherd; just don't press me on the point...<br /><br />Which leaves Domingo. A knee-jerk criticism is to scoff at his German but I wonder how many of those who do so actually speak the language and have noticed how much it had improved by the time of this recording? It's still a bit Hispanic but no disaster. He can certainly manage this role without strain in studio takes and brings all his stage experience andmuch rich, intelligent singing to bear on it. The weight and colour of voice are right; he is touching in his Third Act raving, more musical than Melchior's wayward if compelling moaning or Vickers' effortful agonisings. Always a key point for me is when Tristan has his quasi-mystical vision of the ship scudding over the waves and bringing the waving Isolde to him, first lilting in 3/4 time: &#34;Und drauf Isolde, wie sie winkt&#34;. Domingo catches the other-worldly desperation of his illusion and Pappano supports him nobly; &#34;Ach, Isolde, Isolde! Wie sch&ouml;n bist du&#34; is sung with the requisite poetic stillness.<br /><br />On balance, therefore, this is a &#34;Tristan&#34; I admire but would rank middlingly. For fire, passion and the kind of integrated, visionary quality that sweeps you up into its world and which is missing from this careful account, I return to a batch of recordings from fifty and sixty years ago.colour of voice are right; he is touching in his Third Act raving, more musical than Melchior's wayward if compelling moaning or Vickers' effortful agonisings.

B0018AJNH2|1.0|this is a STUPID movie! tho a lot of people may not have liked any of the other cube movies, this one is by far the worst of them all! i liked cube 2: hypercube and the first cube because it focused just on the people in the box. this cube zero has a different genre to it and completely isnt like those other 2 movies. instead of only focusing on the people in the rooms, they show people thats behind the whole deal and its just not the same as the other 2 movies. the music is stupid and sounds cheap and just completely doesnt give you the feel of the other cube movies. i wish i did not rent this crap. save your money and take my word on it, cube zero sucks! do not see it. i didnt even finish seeing the whole thing.. i had to stop it in the beginning part because the vibe of this movie is stupid from the beginning... whoever rated this movie more than 1 star is weird..  over all, NOT a good movie like the other cube movies! do NOT rent or buy it!!
0981951244|5.0|Book review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.<br /><br />Over the years I have read a large number of self-help books.  This one is a small book (6-inches wide and only 7½-inches long) of only 162 pages of text.  So, right up front you know that it will be a short read.  It reads quickly and comfortably.<br /><br />Every day of his life, Hardy reads \\"something positive and instructional\\" (p. 103).  I would recommend this book--that is, if you're looking for something positive and instructional.  It fits, it works, it succeeds!  \\"Finally,\\" Hardy writes, \\"I like to read at least ten pages of an inspirational book before going to sleep.  I know the mind continues to process the last information consumed before bedtime, so I want to focus my attention on something constructive and helpful in making progress with my goals and ambitions\\" (p. 104).  I have a second suggestion: Read this book.  If you've already finished it?  Read it again.<br /><br />There is no index, no notes, and no references.  Often, this is a trigger for me that suggests that the book is lightweight, frivolous, shallow, and not to be taken seriously. What counters that notion in this book, are the credentials of the writer himself.<br /><br />Hardy has been a leader in the personal development industry for sixteen years, a successful entrepreneur by the age of eighteen, and CEO of a company producing $50 million in revenue by the age of 27.  But these, to me, are not the most profound credentials.  He has been the publisher and editorial director of SUCCESS magazine for five years (since September of 2007).<br /><br />It is his work at SUCCESS magazine that gives him the unique credentials to write this book.  That is because, as he says it himself, \\"as publisher of SUCCESS magazine, I sift through thousands of article submissions and books, help choose the experts we feature in the magazine, and review all of their material.  Each month I interview a half-dozen top experts on a multitude of success topics and drill down to their best ideas.  All day, every day, I read and filter through an ocean of personal-achievement information\\" (p. 3).  That is what makes this book great--no, not just great, terrific!<br /><br />Throughout the book he borrows from the self-help gurus he has interviewed, written about, or read about.  He cites his sources, of course, but he borrows liberally.  So, this isn't just Hardy talking, he backs up his thoughts, and he offers tidbits and suggestions that have worked for others and that he, himself, has adopted in his life.  This makes for a very enjoyable read.<br /><br />His background, expertise, and knowledge is evident (and appreciated) throughout this short book, and he is absolutely correct: If you want a distillation of what all the other self-help authors have written about ad nauseam, this is surely the book for you.  It is crisp, succinct, well-written, and full of noteworthy, memorable, and valuable examples.<br /><br />There are so many places in this book that directly reinforce what I have been teaching for over thirty years.  For example, he says, \\"For most of us, it's the frequent, small, and seemingly inconsequential choices that are of grave concern.  I'm talking about the decisions you think don't make any difference at all.  It's the little things that inevitably and predictably derail your success.  Whether they're bone-headed maneuvers, no-biggie behaviors, or are disguised as positive choices (those are expecially insidious), these seemingly insignificfant decisions can completely throw you off course because you're not mindful of them\\" (p. 25).<br /><br />For a second  example, Hardy was in a seminar when the speaker asked, \\"What percentage of shared responsibility do you have in making a relationship work?\\"  Well, the answer is NOT 50/50, 51/49, or even 80/20. \\"The instructor turned to the easel and wrote 100/0 on the paper in big black letters. `You have to be willing to give 100 percent with zero expectationof receiving anything in return.' Only when you're willing to take 100 percent responsibility for making the relationship work will it work.  Otherwise, a relationship left to chance will always be vulnerable to disaster.'\\" (p. 29). This is a point I made in my college textbook, UNDERSTANDING INTERPERSONAL COMMUNICATION (HarperCollins), and it is one, too, that I make in the chapters on interpersonal communication in my textbook, COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY, 10e (McGraw-Hill, 2012).  It is an abolutely essential criteria that will determine the success or failure of a relationship.<br /><br />For a third example, \\"You alone are responsible for what you do, don't do, or how you respond to what's done to you.  This empowering mindset revolutionized my life.  Luck, circumstances, or the right situation wasn't what mattered.  If it was to be, it was up to me\\" (p. 30).  It revolutionized my life as well.<br /><br />For yet another (can you believe a fourth?) example, \\"Personally, I'm always happy when something is hard.  Why?  Because I know that most people won't do what it takes; therefore, it will be easier for me to step in front of the pack and take the lead\\" (p. 90).  This was a philosophy of life I adopted early in my educationall career, and it has paid off in spades.<br /><br />There are so many other examples!  For me, it just proves (over and over again) the validity of Hardy's ideas and suggestions.<br /><br />Also, I liked the \\"Summary Action Steps\\" Hardy places at the end of each chapter.  No, they're not really needed.  This is a short book, and chapters read quickly.  But I think the reinforcement they offer is useful, and since each one is so practical, they can serve a functional assist for those who are trying to put Hardy's advice into action.<br /><br />You see what really energized me about this simple but profound book?  He reinforces, buttresses, supports, and lends encouragement to what I have taught, lectured about, put into my speeches, and written about for all of my professional life.  All in a 162-page book!  It has taken me so much more time and space that it's embarrassing!  (He says with tongue placed squarely in cheek! --even though tongues are not square!)<br /><br />This book isn't merely motivational (and yet it is!), it is inspirational!  If you are looking for a book that will rouse your spirits, stir your emotions, energize your conscience, influence your intellect, galvanize your gut, and incite you to action with a fire in your belly, then choose this stimulating, animating, uplifting book, because it will have a compound effect on your life!lity for making the relationship work will it work.  Otherwise, a relationship left to chance will always be vulnerable to disaster.'\\" (p. 29).

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|Just I finished reading the novel and I realized that the only version of \\"PRIDE AND PREJUDICE\\" TO COLLECT. Not only is faithful to the novel but despite some liberties (very few) taken expresses well the spirit of history, no customs or anachronistic modernisms in accented (as some called Jane Austen fans were proclaim it); is even better than the British miniseries (despite the excellent performances of Jennifer Ehle, who does not match the physical description of the protagonist, but magnificent in her interpretation, and Colin Firth as Darcy, masterful, although Matthew Mc Fayden is at his level also). Very artistic ( for current standards) and naturalistic acting in all players. Excellent Adaptation. Very good direction. Don't pay attention to those people who say that this is a bad or mediocre adaptation haven't romantic or sensitive spirit so better they read the novel to criticize this movie. Great romance.

B0069GRIHW|5.0|There is no denying that this is one the Doors' best and the perfect cap on their career with Morrison.  Anyone who likes the Doors should probably buy this, even though Orange County Suite and You Need Meat are missing.  But if you're a fan you probably have those songs anyway.  My only beef is calling the songs on the second disc alternate versions.  I think alternate takes is more accurate.  An alternate version to me would be, for example, having two different cuts of Hyacinth House that sound different but are both album worthy and the band then releasing the version that didn't get chosen for the album.  The alternate takes are interesting to hear but not probably something I'll go back to over and over again.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|This video is advertised as 'driving' but only 3 scenes of a few minutes driving scenes.. this movie is horrible! the only good part was the first 10 minutes of the movie. This movie isn't with 5,10 or 20 dollars. It should be priced at 1$ for blu-ray.

B001AQWC2C|4.0|This album shows why Judas Priest will always remain one of the most innovative and important metal bands of all time. While other bands like AC/DC, Iron Maiden, and Slayer have basically released the same album again and again for the past 20 years, Judas Priest continually evolves their sound. This has led to some mind-blowingly awesome LPs like Painkiller and Sad Wings of Destiny and some not so hot ones like Turbo. The band also is responding to many fans' complaint on this record of Priests' juvenile lyrical content that pervades throughout many of their records. This record has hands down the best researched and most thought out lyrical content of ANY priest record. Poetic verses are sung over some absolutely gorgeous synth lines and string arrangements.  There are certainly some awesome tracks on this record. The intro Dawn of Creation opens with a very lush instrumental section that transitions into Prophecy, which kicks the record off with a catchy bang. The followup track Revelations is a track with some excellent vocal harmonies and very inventive and mesmerizing guitar work including an awesome interlude of acoustic spanish guitar. The Four Horsemen/War isn't a bad track but from here on the rest of disk one slips (barring the rocker persecution). The problem isn't that the songs are particularly \\"bad\\" in fact I can listen to most of these songs on their own but the rest of disk one becomes a bit motonous. What would have made this disc better would have been a couple of metal scorchers along the lines of Painkiller and Hellrider. This would have shown a much fuller range of songwriting in my opinion and made the disc a little more exciting.  Luckily disc two is actually better. I love the catchy symphonic exiled and its follow up Alone has an incredible chorus. The single \\"Visions\\" is incredibly catchy and the title track is the only real face melter, but a superb one at that. The closer The \\"Future of Mankind\\" also has some awesome harmonies in courtesy of Tipton and Downing, and is a great song.  So what could have made this record a little better? I think if New Beginnings, Lost Love and Conquest were replaced by face-melting metal it would have made a more exciting record. There is a sense of mid-tempo little plodding in parts. However, the lyrical content and instrumentation (some of the best and probably the most creative the band has ever done) are top notch and there's more than enough great material on here to entertain fans of PROGRESSIVE METAL. A very good record that shows Priest pushing the limits of heavy metal which is admirable for a band as old as theirselves.

B00664AM5C|4.0|To watch a movie without insane military types making chemical weapons, evil conspiracies, the world being totally destroyed, or the hype of watching people fall on the ground and turn into slime- what a refreshing change from the usual \\"epidemic\\" movies.  This is the microbe movie I have been craving all these years.  It was different from the standard Hollywood fare.  You don't have to go \\"over the top\\" to elicit terror - the truth is enough with this subject.  The movie is actually scientifically literate.  I watched and thought, yes, I can see that really happening - the man going into the store to find the shelves empty because no one will deliver, the people getting mad and storming MRE trucks because supplies are out, the people who simply lock their doors and disappear.  The casual amoral entrepreneur making a buck off of a marketing deception.  A kidnapping of an aid worker, which is much more common than we like to think.  There is plenty to make such subject matter interesting without stretching the truth - not even one of those improbably strange romances that often sneak into supposedly accurate movies.  Thank God.  What was interesting to me was the effort of good people to find a cure.  The loss of the innocent, those who make small mistakes, the casual transmission of the illness to people just traversing their daily chores - this is quite exciting enough, without lurid overexcesses.  I enjoyed this movie, and recommend it to those who read my first sentence and think, yes, I've been waiting for an intelligent film on this topic, also.
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|Most people who go to see James Watkins' \\"The Woman in Black\\" will be perfectly satisfied with it. This lushly filmed ghost story, set in a remote English village in Edwardian times, does precisely what it sets out to do, which is to provide a steady stream of gasp-inducing thrills to its audience. Daniel Radcliffe is a few years too young to play Arthur Kipps--grieving widower, failing lawyer and father to a four-year-old son--who goes to sort out the tangled estate at creepy Eel Marsh House in a last-ditch attempt to save his career. But Radcliffe gives a solid and convincing performance nonetheless, as do Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer as a local couple who know more than they're saying about the mysterious title character, who appears in the cemetery next to the house at unexpected moments. The thrills, when they start coming, come pretty much nonstop, and Watkins & Co. deserve credit for remembering a cinematic truth too often forgotten these days: what you don't see is scarier than what you do.<br /><br />As good as the new \\"Woman in Black\\" is, however, I still prefer the old TV version directed twenty-odd years ago by Herbert Wise. The basic story of the two versions is the same, but the details are somewhat different. In particular, the older version is bleaker, more hypnotic, and ultimately more tragic than the newer. The story in the older version builds more slowly, and the shocks are fewer, which many viewers undoubtedly wouldn't like. But the slower buildup allows the story's horror to creep more firmly into your bones, and the shocks--when they come--are the most powerful I can think of in any horror movie.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the studio that made the new version has withdrawn the old one from distribution, so that it cannot be exhibited or sold anywhere. The old DVDs, when you can find them, fetch $100 or more apiece. Fans, however, are still willing to pay that. It may be that many viewers, seeing both versions, would still prefer the newer. All I hope is that soon the studio will re-release the old version and allow viewers to judge for themselves.the studio will re-release the old version and allow viewers to judge for themselves.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|What this sprawling and inconsistent package of about thirty excellent covers of Bob Dylan songs and forty six not so excellent makes me think is that Bob Dylan is best compared to William Shakespeare. His body of work looks set to be drawn upon for many decades if not centuries to come. Like W.S., Dylan is the prime creator in his tradition. As Shakespeare is the essential root and measure of dramatic literature, so has Dylan given unmatched weight and substance to the literature of folk-blues-rock. We have a lot more performances to come, more than we're likely to hear.  This dinosaur of a CD set is worth listening to if you have five hours to spare. I shall make no personal recommendations, though Tom Morello does a fair Blind Willie McTell and Pete Seeger's recitation of Forever Young touches on the sentimental side of Dylan in a far from saccharine manner.  But that's not the point. The songs themselves are, as always, grand and beautiful and will long remain. The Scandinavians should give the man a Nobel prize for literature. He deserves it, though it will make no difference either to history or Bob's bank account if he doesn't get one.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I received my kindle fire as a christmas gift and fell in love with it. (If that's possible) It got me back into reading again which I haven't been able to do for years. The apps have also come in handy during my 7 yr olds asthma flare ups and we are sitting in the bathroom w/ the shower running for what feels like forever to the both of us. The only issue that I have had with it is that it wouldn't turn back on today. However, after finding the kindle forum and reviewing the posts it just needed a quick 30 sec reset and now it's back to normal..thankfully, because there's a true crime story calling my name. I think the Kindle Fire has something to offer for everyone.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It took my 2 days to read this book and in that time ive put it down once (it was 3:30 am and I got up at 7 am that day so i was very tired). I think just that says a lot about the book.  Ive read other people's reviews and I have to say yes - children (<18)should probably not read this book (its violent and bloody) and no - this is not a ripoff form \\"battle royale\\". Why? If you actually read more then 1 book once a year you should know that ideas in fiction books tend to come back once in a while. I mean come on thousands of books are written every yeah since forever. If you expect every idea to be 100% different from one another i have bad news. Look at a lot of crime books. See what I did there?  Now what i liked about the book. I liked the 3rd person narration, the whole idea of the world, the history behind organizing hunger games. The book might lack a bit of descriptions but that leaves space for your imagination so thats not that bad actually. I liked that the main character doesnt change when she enters the competition.  I apologize for any language mistates I made but english is not my native.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|I got this in a gold box deal for $17.99 (the third movie dark of the moon is currently sitting at $19.99 so there was simply no point in not getting this) and it was well worth it.<br /><br />the movies look great, lots of great cgi and some very funny moments. though I will say that especially for the 2nd and third movie the 1st act is very slow and uninteresting but they pick up in the 2nd act to a crescendo in the 3rd act. the first two movies are great for kids and adults alike though the third I would not recommend (more than a few panty shots and an honestly shocking scene where people get vaporized on camera with the only thing left behind being shreds of clothing and bones which completely came out of nowhere for me. they also added blood to the robots for the third movie and the general theme is just a whole lot darker (it honestly surprised me that hasbro allowed them to push it that far)<br /><br />still they're amazing films, and definitely worth watching (though one caveat for the third film though,there's a scene on the highway that...doesn't look right. like the quality just drops for the scene, the backgrounds get kinda fuzzy compared to the crispness of the rest of the film and the cgi just looks very budget compared to the rest (like they were in a rush just for this scene) not sure if it's just me or not but I thought I'd put it in here) and for the price it's a really sweet deal!<br /><br />(also if you're looking for special features I'd suggest looking elsewhere since these don't have any)

B004EF8ARM|5.0|I watched this series a day after finishing the book. Although it did change some parts of the book and skip others, on the whole it sticks very close to the book, both in its portrayal of the scenes in the book and in its preserving the book's mood and messages.<br /><br />Daniela Denby-Ashe was certainly not how I imagined Margaret physically, but she did a superb job of playing her exactly as she was personality-wise in the book. Richard Armitage was also a great (and handsome) Mr. Thornton. Sinéad Cusack was also great in portraying a mother who above all else loves her son and cares only for his happiness, no matter what enemies she has to make.<br /><br />The music was also good and some scenes were absolutely brilliant. The \\"I believe I have seen hell, and it's white. Snow white.\\" from the ending of episode one, for instance, was so haunting and beautiful that I know it is a scene I will always remember. It is an example of where the series, when departing from the book, mostly added to the story. I strongly suggest youtubing \\"North and South white hell\\" and watching the scene. Hopefully watching it will encourage you to watch the rest of the series as well.
B005D63RQK|5.0|This show is truly one of the most brilliant shows on television since the Sopranos. I think of this show as a mix between Dexter and the Sopranos. Every turn in this series holds your interest, even the \\"Fly\\" episode from season 3. The writing, dialog, and acting is truly top shelf! It will be hard to see this series end after season five, but I believe it is totally necessary which makes me think of the Billy Joel song \\"Only The Good Die Young.\\"
0061969656|5.0|As a Bernard Cornwell fan I wasn't all that thrilled with THE FORT and was patiently waiting for his next book, hoping that he'd get back to his more entertaining 9th century sagas. With the DEATH OF KINGS he's back and, once again, at his best. But as a descendent of Vikings maybe I'm more than a little bias about the subject matter. How can you not love Uhtred, his shield walls, and pagan ways as he fights for young Christian England and fights the hypocrisy of those who he serves?<br />  Five stars, folks because this is Cornwell, once again, at his best!

4805311193|3.0|The stillness of the night is shattered by clashing steel. The year is 1864, and a group of ronin samurai have not only prevented an assassination, but also saved their capital, Kyoto. Shinsengumi is a historical retelling of these times, written by Romulus Hillsborough, using some of the rarest primary sources this side of the Pacific. The book is about the chaotic period near the end of the Tokugawa Era. In a last ditch effort to hold onto power, the rulers created a unique group of samurais to fight back against the rebel Shishi samurai. The book specially focuses on the Shinsengumi, which literally means \\"Newly Selected Corps.\\" These men became a part of the Japanese mythology for their ruthlessness and undying faith to a failing cause.<br />The primary documentation used in this book is marvelous. Every bit of information is backed by proof, which makes this the most truthful retelling of the Shinsengumi. Too bad it is plagued with stiff writing and weak narration. Hillsborough's style is stuck somewhere between wanting to be a retelling, and a thesis. It tries hard to do both, but overwhelmingly fails. The information in the book is great and for those out there who are interested in a truthful look into Japanese history, it is worth a look. Everybody else should steer clear, as if this book was one of the \\"Wolves of Mibu.\\"<br />*Originally published for San Francisco/Sacramento Book Review*

0307352145|2.0|The sub-title of this book is \\"The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking\\". Unfortunately, Cain never really got to the power part. Instead she dishes out the standard coping strategies for overcoming shyness, supporting children that don't fit in, and how to adjust ourselves to an extroverted ideal. The focus of the book is not clear. Who is the target audience? Mostly, it seems, it's written to reassure introverts that they are really ok, and to let others know that there is nothing wrong with introverts, they're just different. This is surprisingly patronizing, given its title. I hoped for a manifesto. What I got was pablum.  There is a silver lining: I got so tired of being patted on the head about the introvert's problem of dealing with large groups (which I have in full) that I've decided I am just not going to worry about it anymore. That was worth the price of the book.  Finally, there are extensive notes and references, and I was able to identify articles on a specific topic of interest to me.

0062011847|5.0|Only Terry Pratchett could combine a murder mystery, a complex discourse on civil rights and a young boy's endless fascination with poop into one fantastic story. But this is the Discworld, and million-to-one chances always come through.<br /><br />Snuff is Pratchett's 39th entry in the Discworld series. It is also at least the 8th book in the Ankh-Morpork City Watch subseries, depending on how you define the other books set in the city. The City Watch usually manages to turn up when the book is set in the city. Funny how that works.<br /><br />The Discworld books are just plain funny. Sometimes it's gallows humor. Sometimes there's an actual gallows. Death is one of my (and a lot of people's) favorite characters in the Discworld.<br /><br />Back to Snuff. There is some literal snuff involved. The tobacco kind. Although I think the stretched pun applies. Sam Vimes, Commander of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, while supposedly on vacation sees certain things going on and decides \\"that's enough\\".  Like I said, \\"snuff\\".<br /><br />Sam Vimes is a cop at heart. Marrying Lady Sybil Ramkin didn't change anything about his essentially suspicious street cop nature, it just gave him introduction into a whole lot more places to be suspicious in. And it also provided him with two people he loves more than he can possibly admit and will protect with his life and his soul, no matter the cost.<br /><br />Snuff takes Sam and his family on vacation to the country, to Lady Sybil's country estate. Their son, Young Sam, will inherit the estate someday, so he needs to get to know the place and its people. And Sam needs a vacation: his wife said so. The fact that Lord Vetinari, the Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, thinks there's something that needs looking into near Ramkin Hall is a fact that Vetinari is keeping very close to his vest. But then, Havelock Vetinari keeps things so close to his vest that they've sewn themselves into its embroidery for safety's sake.<br /><br />Sam starts out hoping to find something, anything to distract him from the supposed joys of quiet country living. Sam hates the quiet; he wants a good murder to liven things up. But what he finds is much more than he had planned on. Sam starts with a murder, and ends by expanding the definition of \\"people\\", all in a quest to do the right thing. A Guard's job is to catch the criminals and let the lawyers sort out the details afterwards.<br /><br />Escape Rating A+: There is a tremendous amount going on in Snuff, and all the various plots keep simmering marvelously until the very end. Sam Vimes is one of my favorite point-of-view characters in the Discworld, and he's one who has changed the most over the course of the series. He started out as the commander of a very disgraced City Watch, and also a man who had seen too much, done too much, and was trying to forget way too much of it at the bottom of a bottle. Starting with the events in Guards, Guards, the City Watch, and Sam Vimes life, start to turn around, almost as if there is a symbiotic effect. By the time of Snuff, Sam is as happy as he's ever going to be, but he's never forgotten who he was or where he came from. He still carries that darkness inside him, literally as well as figuratively. It's his greatest strength as well as his biggest weakness.<br /><br />Snuff is about solving a murder. But Sam can't resist commenting on the world as he finds it. He's still a street rat from Ankh-Morpork. So when he starts to stir things up, he stirs everything up.  That's Sam. If a bunch of poor little rich girls are complaining that they can't find husbands because they have no dowries, he'll tell them to get off their butts and go to work. Women with jobs find their own husbands, and in the meantime, they're self-supporting and don't have to worry about dowries. And if one of them turns out to be the Discworld's Jane Austen, so much the better.<br /><br />Murder is murder, and if the person murdered isn't legally a person, well that's just plain wrong. The law needs to be changed, because murder is wrong.<br /><br />This review is being posted on November 24, the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. I chose Snuff for two reasons. I'm always grateful to see another Discworld book. They make me laugh and they make me think, and that's a difficult combination.<br /><br />The second reason is that each new Discworld book now is a gift. I hope there will be lots more, but the odds are against it. It's time for another one of those million-to-one shots to come in.posted on November 24, the Thanksgiving holiday in the US.

030788743X|5.0|Ready Player One by Ernest Cline is a veritable tour de force of storytelling. This dystopian near-future novel is absolutely fantastic science fiction of the cyberpunk school, but it is also an intense commentary on modern society, with more than a dash of nostalgia and a slap upside the head, for anyone, absolutely anyone, who spends their life looking back at their \\"glory days\\" instead of living their real life in the now. A lesson that does not just apply to geeks and video gamers.<br /><br />James Halliday was dead, to begin with. So this is not his story. But it is. Because Ready Player One is about the fight for the world he created, and the company he left behind. And James Halliday left himself as the ghost in his own machine. Until someone solves the ultimate riddle in the ultimate quest, and proves themselves worthy of becoming his heir.<br /><br />Wade Watts is just one of many players in the OASIS in 2044, when every player receives Halliday's last message. And Wade embarks on that ultimate quest. Not in pursuit of worldly glory, but because the real world seriously sucks, and the OASIS and the quest for Halliday's ultimate \\"Easter Egg\\" is the only good thing Wade and a whole lot of other people, have.<br /><br />What is the OASIS? Think of Facebook and World of Warcraft and Everquest and Second Life and every massively multi-player and multi-user everything you've ever heard of on serious steroids. And why does the Wade's real world suck? We can see it from here. If we make all the wrong decisions about everything, like global warming actually happening, and the recession not ever going away and unemployment going up instead of down and the global economies getting worse...well, we could easily end up in the world of Ready Player One. Unfortunately it isn't much of an imaginative stretch.<br /><br />But the story is about the quest. Halliday left instructions. And tied them up very tightly, with lots of lawyers. James Halliday loved the 1980s. (Beats me why, the fashion sense was absolutely horrendous.) However, that was when video games got their start, and when Halliday went to high school. And before the world started going to hell in the proverbial handcart. He was obsessed. Halliday buried three keys inside the world of the OASIS, and whoever found those three keys, and the gates that they opened, and solved the riddles they unlocked, would inherit his company, Gregarious Solutions, which was worth mega-billions.<br /><br />The race was on. It took five years to find the first key. Wade Watts, in the person of his avatar, Parzifal, was the first. Along the way, Wade made friends with another gate hunter, or 'gunter' known as 'Aech' (i.e., just the letter 'H'). They never met in person, only in chat rooms on the OASIS. Wade developed a major crush on a female gunter blogger named 'Art3mis' -- well, he hoped she was female. On the OASIS, a person could be anyone, or anything. And Wade grew up. When Halliday died, he was just a kid; by the time he found the gate, he was a senior in High School. OASIS High School, of course. Even school was on OASIS.<br /><br />And that was part of what Wade and his friends were fighting to protect. Gregarious Solutions offered OASIS education free, and OASIS access free to anyone. There were paid add-ons, but basic access was free, and it was the only escape from the decaying world outside. Everyone conducted their business and their pleasure in the OASIS. But naturally, there was an evil empire, trying to win Halliday's contest in order to take it over and turn every transaction into profit. Once Wade found the first key and cleared the first gate, he became a target.<br /><br />Wade's quest, and his fight to keep the OASIS out of the hands of the evil 'Sixers', proceeds at a breakneck pace. The story is not just a quest story, but a thriller, also a marvelous coming-of-age story and absolutely a love story.<br /><br />Escape Rating A+: First, this is simply a terrific story.There is a tremendous amount going on, and it is all fun and it keeps going at the speed of the fastest roller-coaster imaginable. There is a nostalgic aspect for anyone who even remembers the 1980s or 1990s, because every video game, TV show and movie gets mentioned at least once. But that's only part of the fun.<br /><br />This is a quest story. It's not really about the video game, although that part was very cool. It's about saving OASIS. It's about solving the puzzle so that the world is saved from the big, bad evil dudes. And they are very, very evil.<br /><br />It's also about second chances. Halliday made himself a ghost in his own machine. He programmed his avatar in so he can speak with his 'heir'. On the one hand, he makes sure that whoever picks up the reins is versed in the same minutiae that he was. On the other hand, the advice he gives about not living totally inside the computer is very good advice. Which Wade takes to heart.<br /><br />I listened to this book. The performance was by Wil Wheaton. I would have to also give the performance an A+ rating. Because the book contained a lot of references to the 1980s and 90s, Wheaton was a perfect choice for the reader. There is a reference in the text to the actor being voted in as OASIS user representative, and my husband and I both wondered how many 'spit takes' that had taken, but he was the right choice for that reason. In this alternate future. Wheaton so would have filled that role! The book contains a tremendous number of footnotes with citations for all the references,  in the audio, those work better. Wheaton read them as asides, and they flowed in seamlessly. We took a longer way home to be sure we'd finish the book before we got to the house, he was that good!he speed of the fastest roller-coaster imaginable.

I do however would like to share an anecdote which requires something like Guinness or Snopes to verify.<br />Have you ever heard of Inviso Spray 5,000?<br /><br />If you are not familiar with Inviso Spray 5,000 listen up it is one heck of a product. What it does and don't ask me how but if you spray it on something say anything, the object becomes invisible to the naked eye, in fact so invisible that a few years ago the company had a huge ad campaign under way, they covered all their inventory with Inviso Spray to show how effective it was, a vice president of the company called the police the next day and told them the entire warehouse had been robbed. The police came and after a few days realized that the warehouse had not been robbed but the product was invisible. The advertising firm was promptly fired and they had to spray the entire the warehouse with primer so they could find their product to relabel, insurance did not cover any of the expense's something about an \\"act of moron\\" clause.

B004GYY714|5.0|Being on the move a lot, i miss my local UK radio.  This software has opened my world again.  It was a breeze to setup the BBC radio stations and i am loving how will integrated it is to the Amazon Fire experience.<br /><br />The favourites section is just great and the radio discovery piece again, beautiful.  Nice touch where it detects where roughly you are in the world (based i assume on IP) and offers you the local stations.<br /><br />The UI is clean and sharp and listening to a radio station while using other software on the device proves no difficultly.  Sadly on the Amazon Fire, if you are listening via the browser, as soon as you move focus away from that tab, or the device blanks the screen, the radio stops.<br /><br />This software is the missing link ... and best of all its free.

My grandchildren even sat down and watched it with me and begged to see it again. The true story it tells is timeless: even those born into priviledge suffer torments and have obstacles to overcome. Firth's portrayal of the King is utterly amazing and believable. Bonham-Carter is brilliant and quirky as his wife, and Geoffrey Rush is amazing as Lionel Logue. Have watched this over and over, and it gets better each time. Incredible story, incredibly told. A must have for any collection.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|This is my favorite game I have downloaded so far. I couldn't put my kindle down and had to make myself take breaks periodically while playing it. It has some puzzles to accomplish and lots of exploring with secret rooms and objects to find. Well worth the download for me.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series! I read all three books in under two weeks. Couldn't stop turning pages. I was sure I wouldn't like this series after reading what it was about. Boy was I wrong! Brutal and creative, but also uplifting. And not just for teenagers.
B005HSL626|5.0|I think this is a fun game.It's cool to play this game.You get to slice fruits!In China,my uncle have fruit ninga.He letted me play this game.I recommend you to buy this game.In the end you get some facts about a certian friut.  -Dorothy Wang
B005OTGS4E|4.0|Based upon some previews I had seen, I was excited for this movie to come out on DVD.  I enjoyed the movie, but sometimes the acting seemed a bit sluggish.  I thought the two best actors were the Scottish Drill Sargent and the German ski patrol commander.  I don't want to spoil the story or the ending but will just say the movie is worth a watch, but probably not one of those movies you will watch again and again.
B004WR125O|5.0|Great item. Plugged it in and immediately was picked up by the receiver.  Setting up the wireless internet didn't take much at all.  I love this item and the receiver I bought it for.
B000UGG3A0|5.0|I bought a couple of thier CD's from this site because they are such great prices. I love this band and would suggest this CD along with Road Rage to anyone who loves this band :)
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Downloaded to my kindle fire.  Graphics look good. Can't open map! Stuck at first door.  No hints or anything.  Just squares to press. Obviously some combination needed but no help. What am I missing?
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I've read the series before the TV series came out so I was aware of the story, and having just reread the first book read to give the show a critical eye for its many inaccuracies (like the inaccuracies and butchering of LotR).  I was pleasantly surprised.  The show does leave several things out, but looking over those, those are literary elements that cannot be made in visual productions.  Overall while the show's time is shorter than the book and speeds through some events, all major events (and even some minor ones) are in the TV show, and the fans of the books are unlikely to be disappointed.  For all people, even if they are more inclined to watch a show or movie than read a book, I would recommend a read, if anything the books are twice as good as the show.
B004A8ZWWE|4.0|Real Steel was a blind buy for me. I thought it looked good in the trailers and it generally got good word of mouth. I really didn't know anything about the story going in to my viewing but I expected a lot of heavy action involving robots and not a whole lot more. I was very pleasantly surprised at just how wrong I was.  With that said, first let me say a couple things about this 3-disc set from a technical perspective:  The video presentation here is for all intents and purposes perfect. It is an absolutely gorgeous transfer and demo material in every sense of the word. Colors are rich and vibrant. Eveything is well defined with detail that shows off exactly what Blu-ray is here for; a superb picture.  The 7.1 DTS audio mix is top notch. Everything has a place and the mix never gets cluttered. Dialogue is never lost and there is plenty in the surrounds to keep you happy. Much like the visual presentation, the sound is dedinitely demo material. It is clean and powerful in every way. From well placed panning effects to subtle hints in the rear surrounds this entire mix is everything you could possibly want; clear, concise, and powerful.  Now, for the movie itself. As mentioned above, not really knowing the story I was quite surprised to see what this movie is actually about. I expected action and Real Steel delivers on full on robotic fighting. But there's so much more here that I think some people completely missed. The story isn't about boxing or robots. It's about a Father who is suddenly faced with the responsibilty of caring for a son he abandoned. Charlie (played very well by Jackman), a retired boxer, comes face to face with demons from his past, on multiple levels. Max, his son, is abandoned in just about every possible way (no father, mother dies, guardians leave him for a vacation). Without giving too much of the plot away, there's a whole lot more here than you might be willing to see, but it is thee. This story, from what I took from it, is about a Father and Son who happen to bond over fighting giant robots. It isn't about giant robots with a familial story arc thrown in for substance. That is where I found Real Steel to be a big surprise.  With that said, the action sequences (which to be honest I expected more of them) are very well done. The fact that they worked with real boxers is very evident in the fighting. And the effects, both practical and CGI, are amazing hence the Oscar nomination. The character of \\"Atom\\", the main robot fighter, is so well done that in the end you're not only cheeing for Charlie and Max but you're cheering for this otherwise emotionless hunk of scrap metal as well.  In closing I'll quote Max who at one point tells Charlie to \\"fight for me\\". This line sums up Real Steel very well in that on two different levels Charlie must find himself and become a better man, father and fighter than he ever thought he could be. This is a really, really good movie. Highly recommended!
1427215006|5.0|I've never read anything like this Sci-Fi Cinderella retelling and that appealed to me as something new and different. I'm glad I tried it because it ended up being such a fun read/listen. Cinder is the first book in a new four book series that will also feature Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, and Snow White and it's Marissa Meyer's debut novel.<br /><br />The heroine Cinder is my favorite part of the story. She is likable, smart and brave, and very human in spite of her robotic parts and extraordinary abilities. The other characters also added a lot to the story, both the androids and the humans. The romance with Prince Kai is refreshingly done and I can't wait to see how it develops in future installments.<br /><br />The plot moves at a swift pace, and quickly pulled me in. It was fun seeing how the Cinderella story played out in Cinder's dystopian cyborg world.  The retelling is similar enough to the original to catch the references but with enough of a twist to keep things interesting. Even though I don't read a ton of Sci-Fi, it was easy to follow along and I could totally envision the world that Meyer creates.<br /><br />I listened to the audiobook, and narrator Rebecca Soler does a stellar job with the narration. She gives a lively reading and sounds like how I would imagine Cinder to sound. Her pacing is very good and she reads with the emotion that is called for.  She handles the different male and female voices and accents with ease, and injects Cinder's sense of humor into the reading. I actually liked the narrator so much I downloaded another audiobook that she reads to check out. This is a good audiobook to try if you've ever been interested to test out the experience.<br /><br />Cinder is an entertaining kickoff to the quadrilogy, and it left me excited about the series and eager to read more.  I think Cinder would appeal to fans of fairytale retellings, Sci-Fi, dystopian, and romance. The next book of The Lunar Chronicles is called Scarlet, and yes it's about Little Red Riding Hood, though Cinder's story also continues.  Scarlet is due out next year.h Cinder's story also continues.  Scarlet is due out next year.

B0073LWEXK|5.0|If you like narrative puzzle games, you will love The Lost City.  Very high quality graphics, sound effects and music. The addition of a journal and hints guide within the game ensures frustration free play.  Puzzles are medium difficulty.  I really enjoyed this game a lot and will certainly purchase future games from Fire Maple Games.

B0059XTUMC|4.0|The Artist (2012)<br />Comedy, Romance, Drama, 100 minutes<br />Directed by Michael Hazanavicius<br />Starring  Jean Dujardin, Berenice Bejo and John Goodman<br /><br />I make an effort to see all of the major Oscar bait, even if it's something that I am not sure I'll like. The Artist falls into that category. I have no problem with black and white or the use of the 1.37:1 aspect ratio, but a silent movie? The idea itself is superb of course. Most moviegoers are too young to remember the silent era, so why not provide a similar experience using modern technology?<br /><br />Most of the reviews I have read have praised the movie and it's scooping awards at every major show. Is the hype justified?<br /><br />Well, it was certainly an interesting experience. The audience was very respectful and quieter than for most movies. The movie is silent for the most part, but finds a couple of inventive ways to use both sounds and spoken dialogue. It's easy to follow the rather simple story and title cards are used when something absolutely has to be communicated to the audience. The acting is very good. Dujardin and Bejo have expressive faces that are up to the task. Dujardin has a lot of charm and seems to portray happiness with ease.<br /><br />The audience didn't become involved very often. What few laughs there were usually came in response to the antics of Uggie the dog. In fact, that's the problem right there; involvement. The Artist was clever. I applaud the idea and the execution, but I just wasn't emotionally invested with the characters and the outcome. I found myself smiling at the technical feat of showing us 1927 and creating the atmosphere of the silent movie experience, but I didn't care enough about the characters.<br /><br />Most of my favorite movies are driven by dialogue. I relish watching a Tarantino movie and could listen to the characters talk for hours. When that's removed, for me, so is some of the enjoyment.<br /><br />I'll remember The Artist as a good idea that captured the imagination of a modern audience, but when you strip it down to what's actually on the screen and examine the strength of the story, something is lacking. I'm glad I saw it, but I won't buy it as I don't need to see it again. When the credits started rolling at the end of The Descendants and Midnight in Paris, I would have been happy to watch them again immediately. The Artist will probably win Best Picture at the Oscars, but I think eventually we'll look back at 2011 and think that it wasn't the best film that year.<br /><br />For the idea and execution: 5/5<br />For the strength of story and replay value: 3/5strip it down to what's actually on the screen and examine the strength of the story, something is lacking.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|It does the job, sort of.  But for being the only ebook reader app for the most popular source of ebooks--namely, Amazon--it is very sadly lacking in features.  Just compare to ebook readers like Moon+ or Mantano and Android, or even ebook readers on obsolete platforms like Plucker for PalmOS (which I was a developer for).  My comments are skewed by the fact that I am a scholar in the humanities, and so my needs are for study rather than just linear reading.  Here are some specifics:  1. The search is unacceptably slow.  For instance, to search my approximately 6mb ebook, it took six minutes on my Archos 43.  Compare that to 22 seconds with Moon+, or about 50 seconds with Plucker on PalmOS on a much slower device (200MHz versus 1000MHz).  Search is the main advantage of electronic texts for serious students of the texts.  Without a decent speed search, there is little advantage except convenience.  And it would be good to have some more search options (phrase, word, boolean, etc.).  2. The subpixel font rendering assumes horizontal RGB striping.  This means that the subpixel algorithm fails, producing faint color shadows near letters, in all orientations other than one (on my Archos 43, it works in portrait, but fails in others;  on my wife's Kindle Fire, it works in landscape, but fails in others).  It's not such a big deal on my Archos 43, as the pixels on it are so small.  This is easy to fix: just turn off subpixel rendering and replace it with grayscale antialiasing, or add an option to do that.  And I bet it works badly in all orientations on OLED devices that don't use uniform RGB stripes at all.  (The best would be to auto-detect based on orientation and screen type.  But I don't know if Android includes an API for getting RGB striping information.  On the Kindle Fire's version of the app, though, you could just go on orientation, since you know which way the RGB is striped there.)  Subpixel rendering for the wrong orientation is worse than grayscale rendering.  3. More color options, please.  It would take only a few minutes for the developer to add a bunch more color options.  (I know, because I'm a developer for a PDF viewer for Android.)  For instance, green on black is great for reading at night.  Red on black is essential if you want to preserve night vision.  Black on sepia is nicer than brown on sepia.  And why not just let the user customize it?  4. I wish the viewer would optionally let you move through the text by scrolling rather than paging.  Paging isn't quite so good for complex scholarly texts, as it's harder to think about a sentence or paragraph that is broken across screens.  Much easier if you can just scroll it so the text you're thinking about fits on one screen.  5. There should be an option to eliminate all margins (on a small screen device, one doesn't need more than about two pixels).  The tightest margin setting still has too much margin.  6. Optionally, make the main screen be just a list of titles, like on eink Kindles.  Lists with book cover thumbnails make sense only for small collections of books, and presumably you'd like users to have large connections. :-)  7. I can't find a way to categorize books.  There should be one.  What do I like?  - stability  - easy downloads  - correct formatting  - number of books available
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Love this game! I would have rated it five stars but it keeps freezing on me at the most inopportune time, like when a zombie wave starts.
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|I've introduced this movie to everyone I know who will stay still long enough. I'm 24, so it's not always easy to find friends who are willing to give it a try, but everyone I've convinced to watch it has loved it.  Harvey has a slower pace, and a slightly different sense of humor than most modern movies, but it's truly funny and heart-warming in an original way that Hollywood has abandoned with recent movies.  If you have any interest in the movie, or even just a couple hours with nothing else to do, I'd recommend Harvey for anyone and everyone!

B006H3MIV8|3.0|Amnesty has fought to free the imprisoned and Dylan has sung about freedom for many years.  This semi tribute album is quite monumental with 4 full CDs of music.  The sound quality is superb but most of the songs are average at best.  Here are a few of the songs that stand out:<br /><br />Don't Think Twice, It's All Right (Ke$ha)<br />Restless Farewell (Mark Knopfler)<br />With God On Our Side (K'NAAN)<br />Tomorrow Is A Long Time (Zee Avi)<br />New Morning (Darren Criss featuring Chuck Criss and Freelance Whales)<br />Shelter From The Storm (Ed Roland and The Sweet Tea Project)<br />I Shall Be Released (Maroon 5)<br />I'll Remember You (Thea Gilmore)<br />Gotta Serve Somebody (Eric Burdon)<br />I'd Have You Anytime (Evan Rachel Wood)<br />Forever Young (Pete Seeger)<br />Chimes Of Freedom (Bob Dylan).<br />One More Cup of Coffee (Valley Below Steve Earle & Lucia Micarelli)<br />You're Gonna Make Me Lonesome When You Go (Miley Cyrus)<br />Ring Them Bells (Natasha Bedingfield)<br />Love Minus Zero/No Limit (Jackson Browne)<br />Make You Feel My Love (Recorded Live at WXPN) (Adele)<br /><br />However there is one outstanding song on the CD that is hauntingly beautiful and I hate to admit it.  It is \\"Don't Think Twice, It's Alright\\" by Ke$ha.  For this self absorbed sexed up pop singer who does not realize her poor example and the true negative effects of her lyrical content to young women, this could be an awakening for her to mature, but nonetheless, it is the crown jewel on this CD.<br /><br />What is missing?  Bruce Springsteen, U2 (Bono), and The Alarm (Mike Peters).  Someone was asleep at the wheel forgeting these artists.  The packaging is a dissapointment too. The Face of Dylan surrounded by rainbow type of 60s art that would go better with the Beatles or Jimmy Hendrix.  Dylan is iconic, but seems to be beyond the drug induced 60s pop culture and seen more as a man for the common man.  If you enjoy Dylan, for a mere $20, you get a lot of music; albiet, some of it less than appetizing.  This is average music at best.<br /><br />If you get the CD, grab another cup of coffee and listen for the chimes of freedom.  MADof coffee and listen for the chimes of freedom.  MAD

B0064NTZJO|5.0|I don't review movies, but I feel compelled after watching this one.  I pre-ordered this and it was in my mailbox on the day it was released in stores. Props to Amazon and UPS. UltraViolet is a joke and should not be listed in the title as a misleading \\"bonus item\\". However, that's no reason to give a bad review, especially if you enjoyed the movie.  The first thing that was striking was the picture quality. Absolutely perfect. The opening scenes were night shots, where you'd usually expect to see ample amounts of noise. Not only was there zero noise present during these night shots, but there was zero noise throughout the entire film. Incredibly sharp, perfect color, perfect contrast, simply stunning. From start to finish I was looking for flaws, but couldn't find any.  The sound mix was equally amazing. I just found out that this title was nominated for an Oscar for Sound Editing. The cars sounded fantastic and my sub was shaking the walls. The dialogue was perfectly mixed, it was never lost in the background noise. I really loved the soundtrack on this one. I had initially downloaded a bootleg copy, only to find the soundtrack basically consisted of the same soundtrack from Social Network. After watching it the way it was meant to be seen, I think the proper soundtrack made the movie more immersing.  The movie itself was simplicity at its finest. I think it's unfortunate that some people see the acting as lacking emotion. Personally, I found Mr. Gosling's performance oozing with emotion. There were some scenes where he was expressionless, yet managed to portray a very sad and lonely person. Contrary to that, there were also scenes where he remained expressionless and at the same time was full of anger and vengeance. That could also definitely be attributed to the fantastic direction, cinematography, and soundtrack.  Well, I'm sort of at a loss and I remember why I don't review movies. There's really a lot to recall and I don't know how the pros do it, but I definitely don't have what it takes! Hopefully my petty review will give someone some insight about this perfect Blu-ray.  This one is a must own!

B0034G4P4O|1.0|Despite the technical proficiency on display, this film lacks even an ounce of humanity. It is a cold technological exercise as we have come to expect from Peter Jackson. I saw this and \\"War Horse\\" on the same day and could not believe they shared the same director. Tintin is ice cold, overbearing, and boring. It is closer to Spielberg's worst and most indulgent movies, \\"1942\\", \\"Hook\\" or \\"Temple of Doom\\", than his best fantasies, \\"E.T.\\", \\"Close Encounters\\", or \\"A.I.\\", as it should have been. All of Herge's warmth, intelligence, and fanatical attention to detail is lost here. What we have is one \\"clever\\" action set piece after another. Moffat's screenplay is as one-note and show-offy as his Dr Who scripts have become, at this point I'm ready for him to crawl back into the obscurity of the BBC where he came from. I really cannot think of anything to recommend this movie unless you simply want to check out the latest in mo-cap technology. A huge, insulting, painful disappointment for any Tintin fan.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was told to read this book by several of my friends.  It is out of my realm of normal reading, but decided to give it a try!  I couldn't put it down!  I was able to finish the book and get ready for the movie!!!

B005LAIIS0|4.0|I loved almost every second of The Grey. Movies about people surviving out in the wilderness have always interested me.<br /><br />The cast was believable (Liam Neeson at his best), they filmed on location (you can almost feel the cold), and it dove into deeper issues than just surviving a large pack of wolves. This film is like a horror and action film rolled into one. The wolf attacks are almost horror movie gory.<br /><br />Some people are complaining about the open ending, which I liked, but if you stay after the end credits you get about a 5 second look at the aftermath.<br /><br />For a January release, The Grey is much more of a high calibur film than I expected.

B005J6LKVI|5.0|Extraordinary Film.  Wonderful adaptation from the written word to the screen.  When the Oscar nominations were made public I was disappointed that The Help did not receive more nods from the academy.  Shame on you!  The movie developed it's characters, in such a manner that you truly were involved in their lives.<br />The best of both worlds, I laughed so many times at the way the ignorance of people was out there, and I cried as you felt the pain of these women.<br />It was as if you were right next to the character of the writer as she discovered just how truly biggoted her female \\"friends\\" were. Also the bond developed between the characters was good and true.  This cannot be labeled as a chick flic as I think it will touch men as well.  Could well be agreat family night movie for older children.  It could open up discussion on how people were treated then, discrimination,  self-respect, and doing what is right no matter what your friends think.<br />Thank you to all involved in this film.  More like it please.  Tired of having so much trash out there now just for the sake of making a buck instead of good writing, and films that we want to see.<br />A Must See.[[ASIN:B004A8ZWVK The Help]]

B005LLXB9K|5.0|I am 23 years old, and when I moved from Peru at age 12, my Pearl Jam collection and knowledge included some of their earlier stuff such as Ten and Vs and eventually I got their self titled album...that's it. I knew a few of their songs, some of their history and knew they sounded great, but somehow I just never really got into them they way a lot of people do you know? This documentary shows the history of the band way before they were Pearl Jam and their struggles after they became well-known and not only is the documentary extremely well put together but I have to say it, it made me a bigger Pearl Jam fan. I mean, here is a band I have kinda known, haven't seen them live yet but afterwards it left me hungry for more Pearl Jam. I sound lame?...maybe. I'm not going to pretend \\"I have been a die hard fan for years\\", all I know is that I have been studying their catalog since I saw the documentary for the first time and have never had so much fun in my life. Makes me wonder what I have been doing this whole time. Get it.
B006FE83V8|1.0|The single star is for the blu-ray transfer, obviously not for the movie. I just saw the Spanish edition of this blu-ray, which I assume to be the same, digibook included. I guess Universal has released the same transfer everywhere, so this can apply to all blu-ray edtions of this wonderful movie. Even though Harper Lee's book is of course denser in detail and much richer, which always happens because books and movies are different media, I still think it is a fairly good, unpretentious, touching adaptation. I usually dislike kids in US movies, but these are truly an exception, they are just adorable. All actors are outstanding, and of course Gregory Peck's understating acting is truly exceptional. Not to mention the very brief, breathtaking appearence by Robert Duvall at the end of the movie. Elmer Berstein's score is a true classic, simply marvelous. The photography is also beautiful but...yes, the transfer is, once more, fairly disappointing. They have abused DNR once more and the result, although not as badly preposterous as, let's say, \\"Sleepy Hollow\\" or \\"Out of Africa\\", is still quite sad. Details are lost, borders appear blurry at times, and, most sadly of all, faces are rather waxy, very waxy at times. I just don't understand the obsession for getting rid of the celulloid grain, which was a natural part of movies for many decades; it was the way these wonderful movies were shot and watched in theaters for generations. Comparison with other black & white classics on blu-ray such as \\"Night of the hunter\\", \\"Casablanca\\" or \\"Citizen Kane\\" enhances all that is miserably lost in this one. A real shame. One would think that after the \\"Gladiator\\" affair, which had to be re-released with a new remastering toning donwn the DNR, this mistake would never be made again. But it does seem Universal is getting pretty good at spoiling wonderful movies. After watching the short documentary \\"100 years of Universal: restoring the classics\\" one feels really sorry that so much effort and care is spoiled at the very end with the absurd DNR obsession. They are even proud of removing the natural celulloid grain, and, gee, that is really upsettting!! Specially in the samples from this very movie, where you can see faces loosing detail and turning waxy as they show the restoration in process...One also fears the worst for future releases. Please, Universal, don't do crimes like this anymore.

B004M6UCI8|5.0|Why should I even be surprised by such a comprehensive collection of concerto recordings from the greatest flutist of our time?  Only because I already own a couple dozen of Sir James' recordings and was only expecting a few pieces in this compilation to be recordings I don't have on individual release, and also because (I thought) perhaps some of the older recordings may not be of the best quality given the ridiculously low price.  But surprised I was indeed.  Turns out there were 6 full discs of material here that I did not have in full.  And the older recordings from the late 70's and early 80's are priceless.  Even though I already own most of the RCA red seal reissues from the early 90's forward there's much here that hasn't been released again for quite some time.  The Devienne, Arnold, Ibert... to name a few, plus complete editions of standards like JSBach and Vivaldi that have only been reissued in part over the last couple decades. To my surprise also are some recordings from the late 90's I missed.  All nicely packaged and labeled - 12 discs for the price of 3?  If you think you already have'em all, think again. Now - if they'd just reissue that \\"Sixty Years\\" compilation, I'd be in 7th heaven.  Exceptional deal.  So whether you do or don't have many Galway recordings... this is one fine opportunity.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is many things, super mechanic and cyborg being some of the foremost. Because of her cyborg status, she is also considered second-class in her home of New Beijing. One day the very handsome Prince Kai comes to ask for her help fixing a treasured family android, and Cinder feels an immediate attraction for him. She soon has other things to worry about though, when her step-mother blames Cinder for the fact that Cinder's step-sister has caught the plague that has been decimating humans. When Cinder gets sent into a facility for testing plague antidotes (against her will), things get much more complicated. Cinder soon discovers that she is part of things much bigger than she ever realized.  When it comes to new takes on old tales, this is probably one of the freshest. A futuristic Cinderella story? I was intrigued immediately. The author does an amazing job of drawing you in from the beginning. Cinder is an awesome character. She is strong and brave and definitely my kind of girl. I didn't feel I got to know Prince Kai as much. I really wondered what drew him to Cinder in the first place, but overall I liked him. The politics in this book are a bit complicated, but I thought that was awesome. It made for a very interesting new layer of depth. I felt like the story really flew by, and I read it very quickly. Because the basis of the tale is so familiar, it helps to get you involved in the story and characters quickly.  I did have two slight negatives. One was that the twists or surprises weren't that surprising. The minute one particular plot point was mentioned, I knew where it was going immediately. The other was that I felt the ending was rather abrupt. I was a little disappointed there as I felt I didn't get as much closure as I wanted. I know it was setting up for more books, but I still felt like it could have been wrapped up a bit more. Those things aside though, I really enjoyed this book. I was hanging on each word, and I will definitely look for the next book. Very impatiently. I really want to see where it ends up. Fans of classic fairy tales and futuristic science fiction (along with sides of romance and political intrigue) will definitely like this book.  Book provided for review.
0071624058|4.0|It'd better you read this book, if you intend to do the TOEFL iBT exam.<br /><br />It is truly a excellent first step in order to face this to non-English-native speakers' challenger.<br /><br />The book introduces practically all on what TOEFL requires (four skills to be tested): reading, listening, writing and speaking, with several samples and exemples as well. In addition to that, the CD-ROM brings sound tracks (a help for the listening skill) and two full-length tests so that you can try on your actual performance.<br /><br />Since this book were developed by \\"the people who make the test\\" (ETS), I am strongly sure to recommend this book.<br /><br />Best wishes from Brazil.

B0014I4KH6|5.0|Taylor Swift's albums 'Fearless' and 'Speak Now' are fantastic. This album, however, is really in a league of it's own.  A hidden gem, this - being her first album - is more raw and true, like a young child (oh, god, this is going to be a bad analogy) with creative impulses before he enters structured education, dictating where he ought to set himself. While the subsequent albums are still representative of Swift's country roots, they admittedly begin to tend towards mainstream taste, albeit ever so slightly.  'Taylor Swift' is fun largely because of how unrefined it is. One moment, you'll be listening to a song that sounds like a studio-produced track, both in empirical quality and lyrical content, and a few minutes later, you're listening to a song seemingly scribbled down in a fervor only a young girl whose spirits were just crushed could convey. and, impressively, Taylor Swift manages to express more than you would've thought possible through a single-sense medium.  Excuse the incoherency of this, as I'm presently listening to 'A Perfectly Good Heart' and sort of studying. The point still stands - if you like Taylor Swift, this album will provide that foundation, that missing definition of who she is as an artist. It's awesome.
B0034CNSFU|2.0|it was advertised that this product (CD) would be brand new and factory sealed. It was not factory sealed. It was just \\"wrapped up\\" without the familiar factory seal. Upon examining the CD surface, there were some scratches  although the CD played well and without problems. I hate to suspect that this was a good used CD, sold as new, but I have not proof.

B0013ND36G|5.0|I received my copy of Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines from Amazon Germany. I imported it because I wanted the movie on BD with a lossless Dolby TrueHD 5.1 soundtrack. Makes a world of difference! A big budget sci-fi flick like T3 is all about the jaw dropping audio. T3 with lossless audio is incredibly great! The folks on here who don't like this movie need to \\"experience\\" T3 with lossless audio. Guaranteed there opionion of the film will change for the better.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|A friend recommended I buy the Zoom since our Kinect was in a fairly small room and we were having trouble getting it to read everyone playing and not bystanders.  The Zoom did the trick, it recognizes more people in a smaller area which makes the dance and exercise games so much easier to use.  Another big plus, it is so simple to install.  Also, if you move your Kinect to a large area it is quick and easy to remove the zoom.

B0031MA8VA|4.0|It is what is says it is, love letters by great men. I liked a lot of them but I personally thought that they could have picked better letters to include in the book. For example, John Keats wrote many strong and beautiful letters to Fanny but they only included the blander of his letters to her in the book. I almost feel like the composer of this book just took whatever letters she could find by \\"great men\\" and put them in here instead of choosing them by how good they are.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|This is the most revolting, inhuman, pointless, piece of trash I have ever seen (and I have seen plenty of bad movies.) Unrelenting torture of a female is not intertaining or interesting and this is certainly not a \\"masterwork\\" by any rational definition of the term. When the Director introduced the movie with an apology I thought he was doing it tongue and cheek, until I watched the film.  He should apologize and think about seeing a therapist along with the writer of this agonizing swill.  Why anyone would make a film like this is beyond me.  The positive reviews are almost as disturbing as the film.  I am no prude about violence in films, and am totally against censoring or banning of films, but fair warning is another thing. This movie is garbage of the lowest order. (It does not even deserve one star, but that is the lowest rating in this system.)
B0064NTZJO|5.0|From start to finish the film flows beautifully more than any other film I've seen recently.  The soundtrack is great and the lighting and mood keep you glued to the screen till the very end.  Great film, and even better seeing it in 1080p.

0440241901|4.0|Imagine you are on a plane sitting next to a pretty nice looking businessman (thanks to an upgrade to business class because the clerk felt sorry for you) when suddenly the plane hits some bad turbulence. For some reason you can't fathom, you decide to blurt out every single secret you have that has ever made you feel the least bit guilty. This stranger sitting beside you now knows when and how you lost your virginity, the sneaky things you do to your co-worker, how you changed your math test scores from a C to an A, to how you hate G-strings and have managed to squeeze yourself into one that's two sizes smaller than you actually wear because you won't tell your boyfriend your real size. He knows everything! Now imagine the next time you go into work, you find out he's the founder of the company and is in town for a visit. Wouldn't that be fun?  Generally, I HATE chick lit, but I really liked this book. I think it was the humor. Kinsella made it quite funny, even though the story was pretty far fetched. I would have to say I liked this one much more than Shopaholic.

145162445X|5.0|Why are we here, \\"here\\" meaning \\"the universe\\"? Where did we come from ? Where are we going?These are the big questions of life and existence; various religions have addressed these questions almost since we  started thinking, some 40 000 years or so ago. Likewise, philosophers have tackled these questions, and are still toiling away looking for answers. Enter physics, with an astounding array of tools with which to attack these questions: quantum theory, string theory, cosmology.  As I understand quantum theory (and, really, who does), in the beginning, \\"nothing\\" split in half. This was what has come to be known as \\"the big bang\\". For the most part, these two halves of \\"nothing\\" recombined. The remainder, what was not part of \\"for the most part\\",pure energy unbelievably hot,began expanding. We, the universe as observed, this planet, we as individuals, our cell phones and satellites, are the result of that expansion.  Some fascinating questions arise: what did the \\"expanding universe\\" expand into? What does \\"the end game\\" look like? Is our universe \\"unique\\" or are we just one amongst a multitude?  Occasionally Professor Krauss wanders off into the thickets of quantum theory and cosmology, bot for the most part the book is highly readable  Fundamentalist Christians who believe the universe began 4017 years ago at 2:30 PM will not like this book. Likewise, philosophizers may discover they've been chewing on questions that aren't really relevant anymore.  I enjoyed it, though.

0756405890|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, this book rekindled my love of the fantasy genre.  It is a character-driven story, with a lovely, almost believable sort of magic system (for fantasy).  Although the main character suffers from only a few faults (they are whoppers in my opinion), and to balance this he seemingly has tremendous magical power, the author's explanation for this is entirely believable.  I enjoy epic fantasy, and absolutely loved this book.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|I had no expectations of this film, really. A friend of mine mentioned it on Facebook with no comment about its value and I thought \\"hm - I think I saw a link to that one on Amazon Instant Video\\". That said: the film still managed to disappoint me progressively more with each scene, sequence and plot element. It makes a single interesting analogy between the communicability of a pathogen and that of a piece of information. This analogy fizzles to nothing, however, with nary a satisfying comment on how information can be both liberating and destructive. Further, Soderbergh's episode-like narrative \\"cells\\" serve only to make a boring film seem somehow longer than its 1.75 hours. That is to say that the pacing on a story like this is troublesome enough without slicing it into clips spanning a too-wide range of characters, locales; plot structures. I'd have given it a single star if not for a few good sequences like the interview with Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Not bad enough to regret having watched it but pretty damn bad, let me tell you.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|this app makes louder music for the kindle fire than any otherr app ive downloaded so far. the only thing wrong is it asks you if you want to open youtube or watch youtube videos in browser or youtubemate.
B000002J2D|3.0|In a way, it seems kind of ironic that the departure of key frontman Peter Gabriel barely caused Genesis to bat an eyelid musically speaking, yet the loss of the increasingly marginalised Steve Hackett resulted in a major reinvention of their sound. But it's not so surprising really: Hackett's extended classical guitar interludes formed a major part of Genesis' prog sound, often taking a song in a completely new and exciting direction. Tony Banks has stated publicly that Hackett was his \\"ally\\" in persuing the more experimental prog-rock side of the band. Without Hackett on board, you get the feeling Genesis became a bit of a two-on-one, with Banks' musical amibition increasingly tempered by Mike Rutherford's wistful balladry and the growing pop sensibilities of Phil Collins.  'And Then There Were Three' clearly highlights this shift in direction. It's not just that the band start bringing in upbeat pop and love songs, even the \\"proggy\\" songs are considerably more stripped back and direct than before. Without Hackett's instrumental bridges and solos, the tracks are much shorter on average, and follow a more standard pop-rock verse/chorus format. There's nothing as ambitious as 'One For The Vine', or even 'All In A Mouse's Night', here. And the lyrical themes are becoming less fanciful and more wordly, with a greater emphasis on personal relationships and character studies. The result is a bunch of tracks that sound like pop songs trapped in a prog song's body, or vice versa.  Fans of old-school Genesis will enjoy the three most prog-styled tracks; 'Down And Out', 'Burning Rope', and 'The Lady Lies'. All three tracks showcase the bands' continued exceptional musiciainship and high-quality songwriting, even if the complexity has been reigned in slightly. Other familiar Genesis staples include the 'Your Own Special Way'-esque Rutherford ballads 'Snowbound' and 'Say It's Alright Joe', and the more ambitious Tony Banks ballad 'Undertow'. At the other end of the scale, 'Scenes From A Nights Dream' was probably the most poppy thing they'd done at the time, while 'Many Too Many' and the obvious hit single 'Follow You Follow Me' are straightforward love ballads. The simplicity and accessibility of the latter tracks must have come as a real shock, especially since their previous album 'Wind And Wuthering' contained some of their least immediately accessible work.  It's a real mixed bag on 'And Then There Were Three', and I can understand why the album is under-rated, even dismissed, by many fans. The sheer diversity of styles means that it's not consistently prog enough for the hard-core Genesis base and not poppy enough for the 'Invisible Touch' crowd, despite having moments that appeal to both. And being the first album featuring this new approach, it's fair to say that the band are still working things out. A couple of tracks seem to end a bit awkwardly, as if the band weren't quite sure whether to strip them back or take them further.  'And Then There Were Three' doesn't quite have the musical and lyrical consistency of Genesis' very best work, and is probably more important for the direction it led to than for what it actually is. But the album does showcase a wider variety of styles than had previously been heard on a Genesis album before, and when the band do get it right (the three prog tracks, 'Undertow', 'Follow You...') they're as good as ever.  [3.5 stars]

B000N4SHOE|5.0|This true story depicts the story of the strong-willed, creative author of numerous illustrated children's' books, Beatrix Potter, living in Victorian England. Despite her parents' non-approval, Beatrix persists in drawing small animals, and eventually creates and has her first book published. The publisher becomes infatuated with Beatrix, but dies during their secret engagement. Beatrix slides into a period of depression, then recovers, continues her writing and publishing, buys up large sections of the beautiful countryside near her country home, and eventually marries a childhood friend. Certainly beats the uncouthness of most of the lives of today's famous writers, actors, etc.
0316098337|5.0|I thought this novel might have been kind of dumb and simplistic, but I was hooked.  It's a complex story told through the lens of a five-year old boy which adds to the drama and confusion of the tale. I was addicted.  Anybody who enjoyed the unreliable narrator style of [[ASIN:1400032717 The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]], will enjoy this.

Found it dark and actually haunted me in my sleep, would wake up and flap the pages again til I fell back to sleep, page turning and cant drop the book read I didn't like the fact of the story, but loved the details even dark,  opened my eyes and taught me about the realities in those early yrs... bothersome!!!  I say it's a great read and I suggest if u want more of this kind read THE WEDDING GIFT afterwards, very similar and relevant! ;)

0061452068|5.0|'The Rational Optimist. How Prosperity Evolves' is by Matt Ridley, author of several books about biology, the development of the human race and of human society.  In this book he argues that while the world is far from perfect, it is getting better.  And that prosperity comes from everybody working for everyone else.  That is, specialisation in skills and activities and exchange of goods and ideas has created a kind of collective human brain.  In the early chapters of the book Ridley describes the development of the human species and notes that, contrary to commonly-held popular belief about the \\"noble savage\\" living in a garden of Eden, for the most part, violence was a chronic and ever-present threat to daily life. He notes that if hunter gathers of times past appeared lithe and healthy it was because the fat and slow had [in his words], \\"all been shot in the back at dawn\\". He believes that human societies have come a long way since then.  He makes a number of very cogent arguments to counter the claims of those who believe that synthetic chemicals, GMOs and modern technologies are doing us damage.  Read this book and feel a lot more optimistic about where we are headed!

0385534639|1.0|I wanted to like this book. I've been planning to join a book club night to discuss it. I may end up sitting in a roomful of strangers that are raving. So here are my truthful feelings (because I will be tempering them on book club night): I kept waiting and waiting for the proof, the details, of the conflict/struggle/master magical scheme. I only have 60 pages left and must accept that it's not coming. The excitement that I felt, page after page, that soon it would all become clear...well, it never will. And, on top of that, I don't care about these characters. So why didn't I put the book down? 1) Book Night 2) Hope. The chapter I'm on keeps referring to the importance of timing. Here's the lesson I'm learning about timing - if the pay-off hasn't come 3/4 of the way through the book, it's not coming.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I really can't say anything bad about this product. It arrived on the day it was supposed to and it was very easy to install on my Fire. The soft part of the cover protects the screen as advertised and the MicroShell back has already done it's job. It was knocked off a table on the first day it was installed. The only downside for me is the foldable soft cover, I rarely use it, if at all and would prefer a nonfolding option. Other than that I really believe it is well worth the price and I would recommend anyone that owns a Fire purchase one.
B001L5U15M|5.0|I've been using a 7x with my Sony DSLR and decided on the 10x when I got my NIKON D5100. I increased the size because I plan on some additional lenses for the Nikon and some days I take both DSLRs out. The bag fits well as I carry it and I get to my gear quickly.  One bit of advice is to play with the strap settings and test them out until you are happy with the fit.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've had my ups and downs with Stephen King's books but this is definitely one I thoroughly enjoyed.  The story itself is intriguing -- it gets you thinking.  It's a well told story with well defined characters.
B004JN1CW4|2.0|I was really hoping this book would be the one that wrapped up the other two and made them all worth reading.  It did.  It was actually fairly disappointing.  While well written, it just sort of ended without really having any answers.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I love this case! It is not too big or cumbersome and easily slips in and out of your pocket, but provides good grip and protection. I hardly notice it is there. I dropped the phone one time from about 3 ft onto the blacktop. It landed on the corner (eek!) and rolled on its side before landing flat. No damage to the phone or the case!  I recommend this to friends searching for a case and the price makes this a no brainer.
B003F3FJQO|3.0|It's really a fine book, but it's not very engaging.  I probably wouldn't recommend it to most people.  It's well written, and this was my favorite of the trilogy.  I just didn't feel like the plot went anywhere.
B000ZN802W|4.0|Overall excellent movie of a true story. They were able to know what happened because he kept a diary. Super most of the way through. Nice scenery, the scene with the old man was a little too mushy, else excellent well done script.
B002QE3CTY|3.0|So I've been trying to fill the hole in my heart left by Harry Potter and The Hunger Games.  Let's just say that this is an okay book, but it surely didn't fill the hole in my heart.  I did read all three, but they weren't all that engaging.

0439023521|5.0|A friend who loves dystopian books recommended this, and I resisted for a while, as it didn't seem like it would be that interesting. Well. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was literally up half the night reading this book - thank god I'm a fast reader. The plot, the writing - all excellent. I have yet to read the other books in the series - I think in part because I'm worried they won't measure up and I'll be disappointed. But this one is incredible.
B0019X3YXM|1.0|There are just some things that do not work in the US/English- a lot of those things are the cutesy and quirkyness of Asian-ness /Korean movies. First off the original My Sassy Girl is a pretty long movie-- it develops the characters pretty well but this version is so short you can't get attached to the characters. At least watch it on a stream first before you purchase it.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|It's hard to have a nice clean flow to a movie when you have a scene-stealing kid and scene-stealing robots too, but this movies does a fine job of it.  The robots are done with some quite seamless special effects.  Good job.  Jackman was along for the ride and was nicely decorative and entertaining.
145162445X|1.0|If you happen to be from New York or California you'll probably enjoy this book, not for the science but for the constant ridicule that the author heaps on the world's religions and people from the midwest.  If you are at all religious or from the midwest (or, God forfend, both), it is the author's view that you are too stupid to understand the book so you'll have to make your own decision.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't think there is a book that I highlighted more quotes in, this book was filled with one liners that could be powerful on their own. Having read all of John Green's books, this one may just end up being my favorite.
B000LC55F2|3.0|You think they could have come up with a better script.  Good actors, but the script had them behaving like 3-year olds playing tit-to-tat throughout.  Oh good grief - this isn't entertainment.  Wouldn't recommend it.

0062112430|1.0|Also appears on The Screaming Nitpicker. Read and reviewed for the H.Y.P.E. Project.<br /><br />Sixty-four years after love was declared a disease, citizens of the United States are regularly cured as soon as they turn eighteen--sometimes sooner if they are in danger of being infected with amor deliria nervosa. Having seen how the disease affected both her mother and her older sister, Lena is counting down the days until she is cured. About three months before it can happens, something terrible happens: she meets a young man named Alex and falls in love. Her procedure date comes closer and closer, and Lena will be forced to choose between a life devoid of love with her friends and family or a life on the run with the man she loves.<br /><br />Characters<br /><br />Lena is our typical protagonist devoid of personality, self-esteem (until Alex comes along--that all these heroines have to be validated by men before they can feel worthy angers me), and the ability to realize that Romeo and Juliet is not a love story. If I had a dollar for every book that misinterpreted that play... She says at one point that most people only spend time with her because they have to, and I can't help but think there is a good reason for that. I wouldn't want to hang out with a girl whose thinks (paraphrased) \\"Thank goodness we don't have free choice or I would have no one because all those pretty girls would have all the boys\\" either.<br /><br />This book would have been much more fun if Hana had been the main character instead of flat, dreary Lena. (Yes, I am aware of the Delirium-related novella Hana. No, I am not reading it. I'd rather not chance the ruination of the only character I could stand.)<br /><br />Plot/Pacing<br /><br />Hm? There was a plot and forward momentum? The book trudged along so slowly without greater action that I must have missed them. My economics textbook was more interesting three-fourths of the time.<br /><br />Themes/Conflicts<br /><br />The government is supposed to be constantly watching the people for any signs of sympathizers or dissent, but they are woefully ineffective as antagonists until the plot demands they do something. Lena and Alex should have been caught much earlier than they were. Something else that annoyed me is that there are two main examples of love in the book: the relationship Rachel had before she was cured and the one Alex and Lena have, and the former helped define who Lena is. The problem is that neither relationship demonstrates love. They look more like infatuation with very slight obsessive elements to me.<br /><br />Writing<br /><br />I've heard much about the beautiful prose Lauren Oliver spins. I saw brief flashes of what people were talking about while reading Delirium, but I was largely unimpressed. I suppose she had to much of it in Before I Fall (which I have not read yet but may read one day) that she was spent by the time she wrote Delirium.<br /><br />On the bright side, the fake excerpts at the beginning of each chapter made me feel horrified just like they were supposed to. It's not for the reason the book wants me to feel that way, but I'm horrified nonetheless.<br /><br />Logic<br /><br />I kept the other sections deliberately short so I could expound on how this book is by far the most flagrant in its disregard for logic among the hundreds of books I've read over the years. It is a black hole, sucking in all attempts at logic and destroying them within seconds.<br /><br />Let's think about economics. Love is not just an emotion; it's an industry. Everything to do with love, from the candy and cards to matchmaking services, pump millions, possibly billions, into economies around the world every year. Suddenly, love gets outlawed. Severe economic damage ensues unless there is something to immediately replace all that lost income. How is the loss of such a large source of income replaced? The United States as portrayed in Delirium has closed its borders, rendering itself entirely self-sufficient and unwilling to import goods from other countries. Yet there is no sign that there is any sort of economic hardship among the people or that there ever was one. Really? All of this would result in a worldwide crisis and possible collapse.<br /><br />Now we can think about it in terms of how humans love. Just as naturally as we blink and think, human beings love. Removing the ability to love from them and then forcing them to raise children is asking for disaster. The children, raised by parents that don't love them when the children can love, would rebel in large numbers as they aged and the world... To say it kindly, it would not be pretty.<br /><br />Finally, who decided to outlaw love in the first place? Why? What did they have to gain from removing something so necessary as the ability to love from human beings? We love love. It causes us pain sometimes, but that is the nature of love and we persevere. I can't understand for the life of me how we would get to that point.<br /><br />To me, the power of a dystopian novel and what truly makes it great is the sense that our society could really fall that far and become the horrid environment the book of choice portrays it as. For all the reasons I just explained and more, Delirium does not have that power. The world appears to exist more to enhance Lena and Alex's story than anything and that is an insult to what dystopian novels are about and why they are written.<br /><br />Was it worth the hype?<br /><br />Nope. It wasn't worth a word of it. The writing, the dystopian elements, the characters--I found all of them underwhelming. I wish I could say I knew what my friends were talking about when they praised this novel, but I do not.<br /><br />Bonus cover section<br /><br />I am unimpressed with the covers for both the hardcover edition (the blue one with the girl slightly visible within/beneath the text) and the paperback version (clearer picture of girl's face).g the people or that there ever was one.

0385535139|4.0|As he does with all his books, John Grisham delivers a decent story, some suspense, good guys, bad guys, and redeemable guys. He also broadcasts his often repeated message that large class action suits are bad for the law.<br /><br />Following in his father's footsteps, David Zinc graduates Harvard Law School. He gets a job with a Chicago power firm. After five years, at the age of 31, he pulls in three hundred thousand dollars a year in exchange for eighty hours a week. He's exhausted. One Monday morning he breaks down and refuses to leave the elevator as it opens on his floor. He goes back to the lobby and bolts out of the building into a bar. A few hours later, drunk, he finds his way into a two-man ambulance chasing firm and joins them.<br /><br />Oscar and Wally, respectively the senior and junior partner, have a way of doing things. Oscar is a timid imposing man, Wally dreams of the big score. Shortly after David arrives, they hook a case that could make them rich. A cholesterol lowering drug called Krayoxx might be killing people.<br /><br />David is appalled at his new bosses' unethical practices, but he figures he's done much worse as a big-firm lawyer. All he knows is the nitty gritty of financial law. He needs to develop street smarts and it might as well be from these guys.<br /><br />The whole book is savagely entertaining even though Grisham's plots often hinge on preposterous occurrences and his characters seldom develop more than a single dimension. Yet he presents the moral issues as being more subtle than we think. The big pharma adversary might well be a despicable man but he's sold many fine drugs that have really helped people. Class action suits might harm society by corrupting the institutions of the law, but handling one case at a time, lawyers often bring real justice to desperate victims.<br /><br />And that is one of Grisham's gifts. Even if we forget his characters and stories, he leaves us with a deeper understanding of right and wrong and of the fine line between the two.<br /><br />Vincent Poirier, Tokyoier, Tokyo

B004A8ZWSS|3.0|Angelina Jolie stars as Elise, an alluring and mysterious woman whose every move is being watched by Interpol. Knowing that, she boards a train for Venice and picks up an unsuspecting tourist (Johnny Depp) who quickly falls in love, is arrested, and has to run for his life.<br /><br />I liked the beginning of this movie, thanks to Johnny Depp's' sweet portrayal of a mousey math teacher who naively speaks Spanish to Italians and can't believe his luck in meeting the glamorous and desirable Elise. Jolie seems less an actress than a model, posing with pouty lips and strutting around in designer clothes. She exhibits little emotion and is completely unconvincing as a Brit. The photography of Venice is so lovely, though, that it almost makes up for Angelina's miscasting. The movie starts off as a clever and fast-paced spy story but becomes muddled and even a bit boring later on; the twist-ending didn't seem to fit.<br /><br />All in all, this is a pretty but silly movie full of plot holes that doesn't seem to know if it's a comedy, romance, or thriller.

I'm not sure what I am supposed to be doing and would like a tutorial or some guidance.  Where is the walkthrough for this game?  Please help!  Thank you!  February 7, 2012  Ok I've played this game for a few days now.  I found the walkthrough and hints and it helped me somewhat.  I really don't like the setup of this game.  For me it is confusing to navigate and is frustrating to play.  It just doesn't make sense to me.  I have have played other hidden object games and really enjoyed them but I am glad for the Lost City I only paid $1.99!
0143036424|3.0|I really liked the general writing of this book.  The picture I got of Wyoming was real.  I was born in Wyoming and a lot of the descriptions in the book made me feel like I had gone home.  I could just feel all of the small Wyoming community come through.  The story line was mostly good.  Only the ending was not consistent with the flavor of the story.  It was almost like the author got close to his deadline and finished just to finish.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Come on Feel the Illinoise lives up to the incredible amount of hype and THEN some!  As someone who normally prefers the music of the 60's and 70's, I went in hoping this album was deserving of the constant praise it has received over the years, and... it most certainly has.  What strikes me as most appealing is that the songwriting is exceptionally melodic and the variety of musical instruments is really varied and wonderfully performed.  You have flutes, banjos, accordions, keyboards, oboes, saxophones... and all these instruments are really taken advantage of- it's not just short bursts that barely make an impression.  You will really be absorbed into the experience... yes, an experience, exactly what a well-rounded album should *be* like.  Not only that, but you can really feel the emotional honesty in the vocal melodies.  \\"Casimir Pulaski Day\\" is one of the greatest songs I've heard in years.  It's structered around a fairly simple vocal melody that's super melodic and lyrically devastating.  What a song!  I could listen to this song for hours.  The title song has a rich variety of instruments utilized splendidly during the second half, and \\"Chicago\\" and \\"Jacksonville\\" continue the highly melodic nature of the entire album.  It shouldn't take long at all for these songs to click either.  I highly recommend it.  It really IS as good as everyone says.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I am very happy with my new Kindle Fire lightweight shell.  I love the pink color and it truly is lightweight.  I also like that it doubles as a stand.  I looked through the local retail stores and the covers were either too heavy or cheap looking.  I get compliments on my cover frequently. It was delivered pretty quickly - not much of a wait.  Very satisfied.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|its pretty fun but can get pretty boring after awhile. I don't seem to get the point this game and some of the games in it are hard and boring
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well it would be better if you didn't have to buy the new games so I guess its an ok game if you like this kind of game.
B00386EZJU|5.0|Words cannot even describe just how beautiful this soundtrack is. There is literally nothing better than this. It is gorgeous. The music stirs emotions from the movie just by hearing it. I listen to it all the time, it's my top most played music on every device I own, I am so in love with this soundtrack (it also helps calm me down from panic and anxiety attacks, so that is a factor in how high it's numbers are, but I still listen to it a lot when I'm not having attacks). The only thing that makes it better than it already is is when it's paired up with the movie (which is equally beautiful), a stunning combo that will bring tears to the eyes and fill your heart with a warm, delightful, fuzzy feeling.  Basically, if you don't own this already, you definitely need to. It is so worth every penny.  And it was shipped to me really fast and in excellent condition via Amazon Prime, which is also worth every penny.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Kept me busy for hours.  Much like Myst, Riven etc in execution, absorbing and tranquil, beautiful graphics, and puzzles and problem solving that's just tough enough.  Great value, no skeezy or questionable permissions required, encountered no glitches, and I realllllly appreciated the inclusion of the hints/walkthrough accessible rt in the game for when I got stuck.  hope these guys make more games, and at this same price.
0393064476|4.0|Well, if reading the Epicureans, and Lucretius, made the world Modern, I guess the American Republican Party didn't get the news. They still seem to be mired in religious superstition. I remember reading Lucretius for the first time; I was amazed at the theory of atoms from the Roman world. And I've always loved the Epicureans; they got a bum rap.<br /><br />This is a fascinating book; it makes me want to dig out my old copy of Lucretuis. The mystery/detective story of finding the poem is riveting. The description of Christianity's focus on pain juxtaposed with the liberating view of the Epicureans is important. It took the classics to be rediscovered to re-engage the world in intellectual pursuits. This is a fine book.

B0001ARCFA|4.0|This headphone is simply great. Music is crystal clear when connected to a decent soundcard playing a good quality mp3 or FLAC. Very uncoloured phone, which was the main reason I bought it. I simply hate these phones with intensely heavy bass (DR.Dre like) piercing your ear.<br />Overall, I'm not too deep into the interior building of this kind of electronics, and can't get quite technic about this headphone. All I can say is that it pleases me for the reason I bought: Use on my PC and enjoy music with pleasure.<br /><br />Since I got this to use with my PC, I've also bought a Zalman Zm-mic1 microphone (cable clipping mic) in order to use Voip and play games, which simply completes this headphone.<br /><br />Definately recommend it!

In short, the book can be summarized as follows:  \\"Wheat products cause blood sugar surges which are very bad for your belly, your heart, your skin and your brain so don't eat any wheat products. . .and, by the way, don't eat any other carbs except non-starchy vegetables either.\\"  Advice for giving up most carbs:  \\"go cold turkey; you may have withdrawal symptoms.\\"

1595141979|5.0|My summary:<br /><br />Rose is trying to recover from the death she feels responsible for while receiving recognition for the two Strigoi she did kill.  Hard to do when she's seeing ghosts.  Afraid of everyone thinking she's crazy, she tries to figure it out on her own, typical Rose thinking.  But when things all fall apart, Dimitri learns her secret and the bond between them grows.  Rose loves him.  His feeling seem to be the same.  But they can't be together and guard Lissa.  Lissa who is growing stronger in Spirit magic even as Rose is falling more apart.  Then the worst happens and Rose faces challenges that she's not sure she strong enough to handle.  Dimitri thinks she is.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br /><br />5 stars - a must read<br /><br />Since I listened to this book, let me start with the narrator.  Khristine Hvam reads Frost Bite and Shadow Kiss.  Her voices were very different from those of Stephanie Wolf in the first book in this series, Vampire Academy.  I sometimes get frustrated when they change narrators mid-series.  Even if I don't love the first narrator, I have associated their voices with the characters and it's hard to change.  Dimitri's voice has no Russian accent but Lissa also sounds more like a teenager instead of a child like she did in book one.  I adjusted and can say that Khristine made the listening experience pleasant.<br /><br />Determined to finish this series, I have started a VA marathon.  I read book one last year.  You can check out my review here.  It wasn't my favorite and that may be why it took me so long to get to this point.  I did love Frostbite and you can read my review for that one here.  I could have done this marathon right then, but I got busy and put it on hold.  I do that a lot with books.  Now, I'm trying to check up with some books on my TBR pile, so it seemed the perfect time to read all of them.<br /><br />I love so much about this book.  I love the time Rose got to spend with Dimitri in this book.  I love how their relationship grew in unexpected and surprising ways.  I love how Rose faced some pretty difficult challenges and while she struggled and was overwhelmed at times, she stayed strong.  I was proud of Rose.  Not ever perfect, she just does what's right.<br /><br />I love how clues were left around the pages about Spirit and what was really going on with Lissa and Rose.  I love Christian and his snarky personality.  He's perfect for Lissa.  (Oh and can I kick the queen's behind?  That girl bugs me.)<br /><br />I love Adrian.  He's so cute with his crush on Rose.  Did anyone notice he was so not hanging on every pretty girl in sight?  Think he's serious about Rose.  She may need some back-up with the way things are going for her too.<br /><br />The plot was action packed and shocked me a couple of times.  One of those shocks was very difficult to get over.  Not sure I'm there yet.  I get so very emotionally attached to the characters in books.  It makes it hard when their live falls apart.  Since this is only book three of a six book series, I may have some stress while trying to finish it.<br /><br />If you are a YA paranormal vampire reader, YOU MUST READ this series.

B000000IUD|5.0|Nothing need be said about this album itself - it's nearly 40 years in release and still selling reasonably well. Now onto this specific release...  As I have found with all of the legacy Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab (MFSL) releases (this review is specifically for the MFSL release of this title, UDCD 643), and especially for those of the Moody Blues, the sonic quality far surpasses that of the mainstream record label CDs. No cutting room floor outtakes, no second thoughts, or extra 'bonus' tracks, just the original album manufactured to the highest quality possible. Look, my wife was a non-believer as well. But after doing blind tests between the schlocky record label release I already owned and the MFSL CD, even my wife is now a believer. I guess that's why people pay extra for MFSL releases.
B004RKXNDU|4.0|This book was enjoyable.  It's George's curiosity that leads him to the events in the book. Even before we meet George we meet little Bill Roach at Thursgood's preparatory school who witnesses the arrival of the new teacher Jim Prideux. Bill goes to Jim's trailer because he wanted to meet him and it turns out that Jim is a hunchback at he has trouble lifting his arm, Bill is fascinated but curious to learn more about him.  The book is a great read but hard to comprehend with vocabulary that le Carré uses. The book has overall good description of characters, energy (though not as much as I like), and suspense.  John le Carré's, Tinker, Tailor, Sailor, Spy, a mystery novel demonstrates the theme, intrigue leads to important events. The novel is about George smiley investigating the allegations that his old army commanding officer is alive even though he buried him after he died.  In the beginning of the novel George starts his adventure with the intrigue gained from one of his old army buddies retelling of another's encounter with their C.O a few months prior to this conversation.

0385344325|5.0|This is the first Jack Reacher story I have read wherein Reacher is still on active duty in the Army. As always, Reacher is the strong, silent guy who you would definitely want on your side in any endeavor. In spite of the fact that the book follows the formula of his straightening everything out in spite of horrific odds, bedding one of his perpetually capable associates and at the end, walking off into the sunset, uncommitted, with only his toothbrush and his hitch-hiking thumb, I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope Childs continues to write of Reacher's adventures and I will read every one of them and ask for more.

B0054R6BFM|1.0|I never write reviews, but I was so horrified by this book I had to comment. Teen suicide is a very serious topic that should be explored in our literature. However, this is an incredibly overdramaticized account. We should be teaching our young women to be strong and support them through the tribulations of being a teenager rather than sensationalizing and justifying suicide for such common occurences.  If you haven't had rumors started about you as a teen, you simply haven't heard them. We are never going to be able to change the insecure, ill-mannered and pathologic among us that start rumors and committ horrible acts against other people, like rape with fictional stories. What we might be able to do is uplift those that rise above such things and find happy, successful lives as many of us  do. Myself, as well as many other women, have grown from such events.  I am personally offended that this author would offer suicide as a valid option.  Despite the unspeakable acts that went on at my high school, the best reaction that would be elicited from a teacher or counselor would not have been much different than that offered in the book. To expect someone to \\"save\\" the main character is unreasonable. Furthermore, the tapes seem taunting to the listener, which is just unpalatable and discounts the whole story as far as I am concerned.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I had to write a review, of some kind, because I was astonished to see so many bad reviews. This is not some typical Hollywood rubbish. This is a well thought out film with an open beginning and ending. Ryan Gosling is fantastic in a restrained performance that relies on expression to convey his thoughts. He and Carey Mulligan say more with their eyes than 99% of films do with their canned dialogue. This is a stylish, beautiful film with perfect mood, lighting, color, music and acting. Every supporting actor is believable. Want it easy and spelled out? Don't watch this film, or, do as I did and watch it two nights in a row. I loved it.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible it is so cool and special to me and I love reading the bible and enjoy too
B0066W1AZK|5.0|it is very good I'm not a good player but it makes it look easy on my  kindle fire you should give it a try it  is easy. to play
B0073LWEXK|4.0|love the option of having the hints whenever you need them, but the game was way too short. I would love to see a longer game play since I finished in under 2 hours.
B005ZKYXZI|5.0|I love action films.  This was really full of action. The fighting Robots were really impressive.  It was enjoyable as people were not hitting each other.  I liked the young man who plays the son.  He tries hard to get his Dad to understand how much he loves and needs him.  Who doesn't like Hugh Jackman?  He plays the dad.  He seems perfect for the part.  I plan to take it to my sons new TV and watch it in Blu-ray.  Be sure to cheer for ATOM.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very fun I play it any time I am bored and I am doing nothing but sitting around. it is just too much funk.
0307948560|3.0|I happen to love all movies Pierce Brosnan is in & loved watching him interact with Sara Jessica Parker who was  wonderful with Greg Kinnear another winner in my book. The movie just made me feel sorry for her little girl who missed her mommy but mommy vindicated herself at the end. Very enjoyable. Pierce, as usual, did a crackerjack job. The seller, through Amazon , is very professional & I would go through him again. The video arrived a day early. thanks.
B004LROMSY|5.0|Great TV series. Eva Green  in rol of Morgana is Beatiful. The best Cast for a Medieval History. Blue ray experience do it better. Soundtrack is good
B000E8QVWY|4.0|There is nothing negative I can say about this movie or the seller. I've dealt with this seller before & always had great results. The movie is about one of the greats who is one of my heroes. I love his voice & I have his CDs in my car so all I listen to is Johnny Cash. Marvelous. 5*****
B0064J6OMO|1.0|Absolutely terrible.  No original humor - just recycled potty humor.  I like Family Guy as much as the next person, but this humor is not smart, and it's not funny.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It's fun but sometimes difficult to get past some minigames. I like it and reccomend it to anyone who would consider downloading it.
193413712X|3.0|Tinkers is a story about George Crosby who is lying on his death bed with eight days of his life remaining.  He fades in and out of consciousness while his family surrounds his sick bed with around the clock visitations.  George revisits his past as his memory and body plan their imminent escape.<br /><br />As George fades, his memory of his father and his childhood emerge to paint a complicated and impoverished upbringing in New England.  George lives a full life with a wife, children and grandchildren.  He built his house with his own hands, retires to tinker with outdated clocks and slowly grows old.<br /><br />Tinkers is a novel of the senses with detailed descriptions of just about everything.  The clocks are a metaphor for life that runs continually throughout the book, as Harding meditates on nature, clocks, life, family, birds nests, lightning, death and more.  At times the book moves forward slowly as the reader's mind wanders.  So then, the reader must re-read.<br /><br />I was drawn to this book for it's beautiful cover, it's Pulitzer Prize winning status and my perception of it as being a quick read.  At 191 pages, it took me longer to read it than I thought it would, and as the story progressed, my mind had trouble focusing during the long digressions on nature and life. I found Tinkers worthwhile and meaningful but wished I was able to focus my mind on its complexities and fully comprehend its unique subtleties.<br /><br />Tinkers is a intimate, beautiful look at how death comes to each of us.  Each word is purposeful.  Tinkers is a reminder that life is slowly unwinding and ticking away, tick, tock, tick, tock.
B004J4WNL2|2.0|I agree with the 2-3 star reviews already posted.  I was looking forward to the book and disappointed.  The parts on introverts and genetics were okay, but in 2012, it was kind of \\"well DUH!\\"  Genetics explain a LOT of who we are. Genetics explain who is gay, alcoholic, introverted, extroverted, etc, etc.  And some of her \\"science\\" seems downright bizarre.  Lemon juice on the tongue tests???  Seriously???  Was this study done at a university?  Double blind?  Was the sample large?  Was the study peer reviewed?  Was it replicated?  I ended up skimming parts because the repetition got to be boring. I found the chapter on raising an introverted kid to be especially repetitious.  I couldn't make myself finish it and I doubted that I'd learn anything new about my (very introverted) child.  Perhaps I missed some gem at the end... but I doubt it.  I also got tired of the stereotype of introverts.  My husband scored a 19 out of 20 on the author's introvert test.  He is very introverted and started working in an open floor plan with a lot of trepidation.  He is thriving, both personally and professionally, in an open office plan.  He is 15 feet from the CEO and has more visibility (both literal and figurative!) and access to power like never before.  He is receiving more promotions.  He is making more money than at any time in his career.  Yes, it was an adjustment.  And open floor plans don't work for every person.  But I'd like to caution people against jumping to the stereotypical conclusion, \\"I'm an introvert!  Open floor plans won't work for me!\\".  Many Silicon Valley introverts are happy and productive working in open floor plans.  My final nail in the book's coffin was the  chapter on \\"Asian Culture\\".  The author went to wealthy Cupertino, CA and interviewed a half dozen Asian introverted students.  She lists a few pithy, fortune cookie length \\"Wisdom Sayings\\" from Asian and Western philosophers to prove that Asia values introverts and America does not.  I'll admit that I'm probably hyper-sensitive.  I live in a city that is more than 50% Asian. I teach at an affluent Bay Area school, 20 minutes from Cupertino.  I teach in classes that are 90-95% Asian.  I can tell you that, yes, some Asians are introverted.  And some are extroverted.  I have Asian kids in my classes who NEVER stop talking.  There are Asian kids who are disruptive and annoying. The class clown is an Asian kid, in some classes.  The class bully or \\"mean girl\\" is an Asian kid, in some classes.  How shocking is that!?!?  There are Asian kids who are brilliant and Asian kids who are boringly average and mediocre students.  There are Asians who are motivated and work hard and Asians who could/would be labeled \\"lazy\\"... if they were Black or Mexican American.  There are Asian kids (and adults) who are honest and Asian kids (and adults) who lie and cheat.  It is even possible Asian kids may even feel the need to cheat in school more than the rest of the population in order to live up to this \\"model ethnic group\\" stereo-type.  Cheating is rampant in honors and AP classes... by ALL ethnic groups... even Asians.  There are Asians who are compliant and obedient.  But there are Asian students who are defiant and rude and would be labeled trouble makers in a economically disadvantaged neighborhood or if they were a different race.  Asians, both adults and kids, are human and have both good qualities and faults.  Not to mention, Asians are born introverted, extroverted and everything in-between!  Surprise!  (Oh shoot.  I'm getting all repetitive, like the book author.  Believe me.  I get it!  I am the most repetitious, long winded writer I know.  If one example is good... let me add six more examples to make my point.  I'm also an introvert.  Look at the long, long, long reviews written by us introverts!  The author's editor should have reined her in.)  And there are plenty of extroverted Asians who are forced to fit some introverted, studious, docile, obedient, quiet Asian stereotype.  There are Asians who would like to be actors or go into sales or marketing or get English degrees.  They are often forced into engineering degrees and careers by parents and OUR culture... the American culture.  The author is so caught up in finding introvert success stories, she fails to see that ALL pigeon holes and stereotypes are harmful or inaccurate.  The stereotype of the ideal, quiet, studious, perfect Asian student is true for SOME people.  However, it is an ideal that is FAR from ideal.  There are Asian kids who are depressed, and engage in self mutilation and are \\"cutters\\" or even suicidal, because of the pressure to live up to some \\"ideal\\", introverted Asian American stereotype.  Asian females, aged 15-24, have the highest suicide rate of any group in the United States.  Like I said, I'm hypersensitive.  I find racial or cultural stereotypes offensive, be it stereotypes that generalize some races as \\"stupid\\" or \\"lazy\\", and label other races as \\"The Model Minority\\".  I have seen, first hand, pain and suffering endured by Asian students in pursuit of perfect GPA's or perfect SAT scores or admission to the perfect college.  I am very bothered by the obsequious rhetoric holding Asian cultures up as \\"the ideal\\".  And I will say that the book DID make me think.  A lot.  I didn't always agree or come to the same conclusion as the author.  But it made me think a LOT about stereotypes and generated some good conversations.  If you are looking for a book where you can say, \\"OMG!  This describes me perfectly!  I'm an introvert!\\", you may enjoy the book.  However, there are parts of the book that I really disliked and even found offensive.  Thus, the two stars.
B004132I4S|5.0|Sufjan Stevens' latest is a sonic adventure that becomes increasingly compelling with each listen. But it's also a very challenging work that demands quite a bit more than a casual ear. \\"The Age of ADZ\\" is a mind-blower and one of the over-all best works I've heard in quite some time. It's too bad that so few will be exposed to it and be able to make up their own mind on its worth. This one deserves to be heard.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover! It looks like an old classic novel.  The elasctic corners are tight and have rubber backing to keep the device from shifting, but I wouldn't have it any other way...  I am very confident that my Fire will not fall out.  The picture does not show a pocket inside the cover.  That was a convenient addition I did not expect. For those who had issues with it not closing flush to the screen--be patient.  Work the spine back and forth and if you wrap the cover around (as I do) when reading, give it a minute or two after you set it down and it shuts flush.  I have had a ton of compliments on this cover and am very pleased with it.  I bought the brown one and it is a nice medium brown color that compliments the gold \\"leaf\\" detail.

B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the rope is a creative and simple game where your goal is to move a piece of candy to an omnom. On my Kindle Fire the game looks great, has good frame rate and hasn't crashed yet. The levels are creative, colorful and simple. The difficulty curve on it is perfect, new elements are introdused right when things get too easy. Over all I love this game and recommend it to all, I would buy it for 3 dollars. PS I understand that there is an update avaliable and is hard to get, I don't really know, this game deserves 4 or 5 stars without the stinkin update
0307891402|3.0|The skyrim collectors edition is the same as the other book it just looks better and you get the interactive map with it that's all I have to say about the book

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've had this app on my iPod and my android tablet and it has been fantastic on both.  the out standing number of available versions is great for comparing passages across different translations.  notes are a grand feature as well.  all around this app nails what you need from a bible app. it has the bible (duh) and a few extras but not so many that it gets cumbersome.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|really great fun. love the variety of games. I think it is a joy to play. I enjoy the ease of use.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|i luv this app. i made it to the top five in this. yaa. in real life this game is more fun though. that is the only down side.
B005UKJX4E|5.0|This was a beautiful portrayal of all the phases of life. From birth to death. From love to spite. I loved this movie, and have never been the same person since.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantasic fun, lasts for hours. Some real brain twisters. Don't miss this game. Play it before your friends tell you about it!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|decent simple games as expected.  enjoyable but the games take forever to unlock new ones and I don't think they are fun enough to play over and over. luckilly we get points for reviewing it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This has been a great cover for the Kindle for only $30. Not only does it protect the kindle, but it is of sturdy construction and has a fold-able cover that doubles as a stand. Well worth it!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|i really loved this book.i read the whole thing in one sitting. i could not put it down.i just couldnt wait to see what happened next.the characters are wonderful and it shows you no matter what obstacles you go through you can always start over.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good its a fun game as long as u know how to play it is fun but a few games are a little confusing
B00006FDCD|4.0|This is a  good interpretation of the Stephen King classic that I read when I was 13. I enjoyed Tim Curry's performance as Pennywise. I remember talking to kids at school about it, and they would have nightmares about him. Harry Anderson was entertaining as Ritchie.  Betrayed by a watered down ending, it would have made a better \\"R\\" rated miniseries on Showtime or HBO, written in a more modern context. Still a fun movie/miniseries to watch, even if it is a bit dated.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is a lot of fun but it takes a while to earn points to play different games! you don't get to posy all the games at first!
B004UID2LC|5.0|my fav app on amazon... and NO I'm not one of the developers of this app to say something nice about it.. I'm just a person who knows how to use the app fully... plus works like a charm on my EVO 4G 2.3
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very easy to use. I use it on my Kindle Fire and have never had any problems. All my cities are programmed in and with just a touch I see all the weather. I would recommend to anyone!
B006E4QCXU|4.0|my 4 star rating is for what the app does alone which is pretty neato but it lagged my phone every time I launched the app  then yesterday I my phone froze completely and reseted my home setting along with other stuff.. EVO 4G Sprint.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Loved it on PC and 360 Arcade, but it is broken on Android. My original Droid couldn't handle it apparently, now I've got a Galaxy Nexus, and it freezes up after a minute or so of game play. Please fix, I love this game!
0062082353|5.0|Darn good book by a Patriot. We are free because of Chris Kyle and men like him. This book probably not for \\"Liberal hand-ringers.\\" Thank you Chris.
B005J6LKVI|4.0|Great Movie one that you really will want to watch more than once to get the full impact of everything it has to offer.
B0059XTTW8|1.0|One of the worst movies I have ever seen!  Don't bother!  For that matter, tell your friends not to bother!  You will be doing them a favor.<br /><br />The original book and the BBC production depicted a complex story - as spy novels are wont to be - and this movie wasted so much time with long cinematographic exercises, devoid of dialogue that the story line was barely visible let alone followable.  It was not at all faithful to the book or to the BBC production; there was zero character development; long scenes with no dialogue were painfully boring.  If I were the author, I would be livid at this wanton destruction of my work.<br /><br />Almost all scenes in this movie were terribly underexposed.  Of course, since the screenplay was so bad, I guess they used this device to communicate to the audience that the story was truly dark<br /><br />Gary Oldman did a passable job of playing George Smiley, but with as little dialogue this movie had, no amount of good acting could save this turkey.<br /><br />Save your money.  See the BBC production with Alec Guinness in the part of Smiley - Now that production was as over-the-top superlative as this movie was in-the-sewer bad.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have enjoyed this app so much. Only drawbacks are that you must have wireless to access most of it, and that not all of the versions are audio. But wow, to be able to lay in bed &amp; listen to the Bible while immobile--extraordinary!
B0055SWM08|4.0|While this simple puzzle based game was fun, often it was far too easy.  It was only perhaps five levels that were a bit challenging, and only the last one made for pleasurable return game play until i mastered the sequence.  I recommend this game for it's simplicity and calming music.  For a real brain teaser or edge of you seat game play look elsewhere.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a great game it is sooper super fun I love it so much I wish they had it on xbox
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I really bounced around taking a look at multiple products to protect my new Kindle Fire.  I decided to go with the MicroShell by Marware and I have been very satisfied with the choice.  Light weight, thin, easy to carry, but provides substantial protection.  Only down side is that this product, like ALL of the others does not hold the \\"stand\\" position very well.  It will work, just do not expect to read a book with it in that mode.  Every time that you touch it to change a page, it is unstable.  To watch a movie, the \\"stand\\" mode works fine.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is fun to play.  It is also easy to play and games move quickly.  Card sizes are just right.
0393338827|3.0|I guess this is what sells books.  People should just keep in mind that there are a lot of issues that are glossed over for  the sake of excitement and a black and white story, when there is a lot of nuance.  So long as the public realizes that this is written to tell a good story, rather than a factual post mortem, it is entertaining.
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Rocky Horror is like my favorite. &lt;3 & I love watching it at the Evansville Mesker theatre when it shows (once every year) Having it on blu ray (HD:D) it amazing. & This movie is a great movie if you like musicals, & transvestides. Lol.

B004CAWKXE|5.0|The first time I heard \\"Na Na Na\\" I was not expecting to end up with an album that succinctly expresses what's going on in my life and the things I'm working through. I'm of an age with the band and everything on this record made total sense to me. In amongst all of that profoundness there are songs to soothe the soul and shake the booty. My 12yo loves it as well, start to finish. The video for \\"Sing\\" is one of the best I've ever seen.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Love this flash.  Quick.  Bright.  Had it for about 6 months and haven't replaced the batteries yet.  Works great for bounce flashing.
B005LJITS0|1.0|I rented this movie from Amazon Prime.  I won't be doing that again anytime soon.  The sound constantly cut out, ruining the movie experience.  It wasn't my TV or my stereo - both of those were perfectly capable of showing other shows and movies before and after this one just fine.  But for whatever reason, Amazon Prime had significant sound issues.  Bleah.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I just finished reading \\"Wheat Belly\\" by William Davis. This is an outstanding book that I highly recommend! It is written by Dr. William Davis, who has years of experience treating people with wheat-free diets. This book is meticulously written with numerous footnotes to articles in the peer-reviewed medical journals and an extensive index. Dr. Davis has included sections on treating celiac disease and Type 2 diabetes with wheat-free diets with remarkable results!<br /><br />This book is on a par with \\"The Paleo Diet (revised edition)\\" by Loren Cordain and \\"The Primal Blueprint\\" by Mark Sisson. From reading \\"Wheat Belly,\\" I obtained a deeper understanding of why wheat is bad for you and how it interacts with the biochemistry of your body.<br /><br />In a field like nutrition where such rapid change is occurring, it is important to keep up with the latest advances, and this book was published August 30, 2011, so it is the most recent and up-to-date book on Paleo/Primal eating. I purchased this book for my Kindle 3, but found that the graphs were not included with the ebook version, so I intend to get the paper version to have on hand for reference.

B004Q0SQ24|5.0|Toy is durable and cute. My son loves him and uses him with all his Thomas and Friends Wooden Railway toys. Wilson is too big for one of the tunnels, but other than that he fits fine on all the other tracks and accessories.
B001F12J0C|4.0|My husband and I saw one of the Bourne movies on TV and we both liked it enough to want to see the entire trilogy.  Buying \\"used but good condition\\"  DVD's makes it possible to have a larger collection of movies without hurting our budget. The movies are edge of the seat exciting.  The acting is great and the chases and twists and turns in the story keep you hoping that good will win out over bad.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|Imagine that you are transported back to the late nineteenth century. But not the real nineteenth century. Just a surreal one that might only exist in your dreams (or maybe in Tim Burton's dreams). And in this world, there is a curious circus that only opens at night. It is a circus full of mystery, enchantment, and magic. That is the world portrayed in The Night Circus.<br /><br />In this novel, Erin Morgenstern showcases her extraordinary ability to bring a circus of dreams to life. The imagery presented in this novel is truly like nothing I've ever read. The night circus comes alive with vivid colors, whimsical tents, and also just a hint of darkness. However, the amazing imagery is all that the book has going for it. The plot and the characters are comparatively weak.<br /><br />The Night Circus is told from four perspectives. I personally, did not find the number of perspectives disorienting, but I can imagine that others might so I'm outlining it here.<br /><br />The first perspective is a narrative told in second-person. Yes, that's right from the perspective of you, the reader. Second-person is very seldomly used in literature. However, the author's use of it here is impressive. The passages that are told from this perspective are by far the best in the book.<br /><br />The second perspective tells us the story of the two dueling magicians, Celia and Marco. Told in a third-person narrative, this is the central story of The Night Circus. The two are pitted against each other in a challenge and the night circus is their venue. Using just their magic skills, each tries to outdo the other. Unfortunately, as the two most important characters, they are also the weakest.<br /><br />The final two perspectives gives us insight into the circus as it is seen by circus outsiders -- regular, ordinary people attending the circus. As supporting characters, they perform their roles quite well and they are more endearing than the two main characters.<br /><br />How much you enjoy this book largely depends on how much you fall in love with the amazing imagery and how much you are willing to forgive the author for her weak story and characters. I read this book based upon a strong recommendation from a good friend. She loves circuses, magic, and whimsical things. She accepted the weak characters as a small price to pay for opportunity to live in the magical world of the night circus. As for myself, the imagery was not enough to sustain my interest throughout the book. I needed a better story with more realistic and relatable characters.with the amazing imagery and how much you are willing to forgive the author for her weak story and characters.

B005XQLBU4|4.0|This game its so addictive!!! I mostly play it on my phone, but it is at its best on Toshiba Thrive tablet.  One of my favorite games thus far!
B006H3MIV8|3.0|Whilst the phrase \\"its for a good cause\\" should be a prime consideration when reviewing this album any listener can't help but face the fact that this is a very long curates egg of an album with the balance just about tipping towards hits than misses. It is a humungous amount of music for the price and great VFM, but frankly had it been cut to a double or even a long single album it would have been a better outcome. Celebrating the 50th Anniversary of Amnesty International and their wonderful ability to shine light into the darkest corners of human rights violations deserves some really special. Sadly this is not it. With over 70 songs from such a strange brew of artists it was inevitable that quality and variability would be an issue. Equally while the compilers have used up to date covers of the Dylan cannon the absence of Hendrix, Neville Brothers, Dave Alvin and especially the Byrds does leave a an aching gap. This is compounded by seeking to accommodate all comers when a \\"stop and proceed no further\\" policy should have been more selectively employed. In particular someone should have boomed out in Gandolph like tones \\"YOU SHALL NOT PASS\\" to Maroon 5 and their pedestrian cover of \\"I shall be released\\", cried halt to My Chemical Romance's butchering of \\"Desolation Row\\", informed Silverstein's that producing an EMO version of \\"Song for Woody\\" wasn't a great idea and let us not get started on Mick Hucknell's laughingly bizarre Dylan impression on \\"One of us must know\\". This is by no means a complete list of some of the atrocities here with Sting's \\"Girl from the north country\\" easily being the most irritating thing on the album while Cage the Elephant should be summoned to appear before a angry judge for their heinous version of \\"The lonesome death of Hattie Carroll\\".<br /><br />Thankfully there are more counterbalancing influences. Steve Earle and Lucia Micarelli take on \\"One more cup of coffee\\" is up their with the original. Not surprisingly Lucinda Williams gives \\"Trying to get to heaven\\" a suitably Southern wasted tinge and as far as this reviewer is concerned giving Tom Morrello and the Nightwatchman \\"Blind Willie McTell\\" to cover is a stroke of righteous inspiration. The \\"Changing of the Guards\\" is profitably rocked up by the Gaslight Anthem (perhaps Dylan rather than Springsteen should be their muse?) and My Morning Jacket rise to the occasion with a ghostly alt country version of \\"You're a big girl now\\". Old Pete Seeger doesn't so much sing nowadays as speak but the tireless campaigner has done more than most to champion human rights than just about anybody and his \\"Forever Young\\" had to be here. Another Pete, this time in the form of Townsend does a lovely version of \\"Corrina Corrina\\" while the dreamy shoegaze of the Silversun Pickups version of \\"Not Dark Yet\\" works rather well. Nice also to see Mark Knopfler back on form with a great \\"Restless farewell\\". Mention in dispatches should also go to Jackson Browne, Carly Simon, Diana Krall and Patti Smith. The covers here which seems to be generating most controversy are Ke$ha's \\"Don't think Twice its alright\\" and Miley Cryus \\"You gonna make me lonesome when you go\\". The latter version is a inoffensive passable cover and Cryus has a nice country twang to her voice. Ke$ha alternatively does a raw strung out (overwrought?) version of \\"Don't think twice\\" which is going to split the jury but to be fair it is at least a radical attempt to deconstruct the original.<br /><br />So there you have it an album that will generate a fair share of talking points which is probably Amnesty's underpinning motivation and hopefully draw a new generation to the wonders of Dylan. Certainly if you come from the \\"don't mess with perfection\\" school of Dylan appreciation this album will be a source of high irritation and returning to the starting point there is something not quite right here. A \\"less is more\\" approach would have been a better policy but we are where we are. That said well done Amnesty International. Happy 50th birthday and keep up the great work.Happy 50th birthday and keep up the great work.

B003QNXPUK|1.0|I got the invisible shield full body maximum coverage because I wanted the side strip. In the box it said precision cut for the apple iphone 4 and there is a sticker that said compatible with iphone 4s. But I see that the box that they send me is an old one? not sure because it came with 4 large strips that doesn't fit right in the side of the Iphone 4s. Also I have to trim one side because it was too long and it will have cover the sim card slot. Plus there where two little pieces that suppose to use on the side between the volume up and silent key. I have to trim one down because it was too big and it doesn't come around the button it is a square one. Nothing like the picture of the box. It is a piece of trash. Probably what amazon send you are the old ones. Because in store I have seen it for 40 dollars.

1932100660|5.0|I read this book out of a recommendation from someone on facebook when I was talking to another friend about how going gluten free radically improved my health. I figured I could at least give it a chance given what I'd recently learned about the effects of nutrition and allergies from going gluten free. The book was a tough read for me because I've essentially been a meatarian my whole life. I've mostly ate \\"healthy\\", some veggies stir friend with chicken tenders over rice or a la cart has been a staple meal for me for 20 years. The book made a few leaps that hard to accept when they are made, however if you take everything discussed as a whole it's hard to not agree with him. Even if you don't agree with him 100%, the evidence is easily strong enough that if you truly care about your health it's hard to follow his whole foods plants based diet. I've been following the diet for just over a week now, to see if a meatarian like myself can handle all veggies, and so far it's been pretty good. Most of first week was brutal as my digestive system adjusted, lots of flatulence which has now abated and I feel great. I'm going to try to stick with it because even though most of my family tends to live to be 90+ years old they all die the same way pretty much, strokes and heart attacks.

B005Q1W10A|2.0|Season 2 of Downton Abbey is a huge disappointment! What started as a crisp and intricately woven drama has deteriorated into a clownish soap opera.

B003Y5HWK4|5.0|UPDATE May 20, 2012: Yesterday, I downloaded the latest Sony software update.  All discs and special features play fine now.<br /><br />The blu-ray video/audio on each disc in the package is superb.  I grew up near Atlantic City and lived in the same town as the author of the book.  I cannot tell you the pleasure I felt when I first saw the Blueberry Capital of the World sign in the first couple of minutes of episode 1. My sister still lives \\"near mile marker 14 on the Black Horse.\\"  Mr. Buscemi has never been better and amply fills the saddle wing tips he wears.  The actors, creative talent, and HBO have done an outstanding job on this series and blu-ray set.  I hope Mr. Scorsese does more television projects.<br /><br />As with many blu-ray DVDs, HBO included a small insert that said the discs were manufactured to the highest quality standards.  I agree.  They are not defective.  If they don't play correctly, your player probably needs a software/firmware update and the player's manufacturer may not have the update available for download yet.  My Sony BDP-S580 updated with Nov 30, 2011 update could not play the discs, my LG 630 updated with Dec 1, 2011 update could not play them.  I was frustrated as many reviewers were.  I even exchanged my set for another and had the same freezing problems (I could only select Play All (no features played), if you think yours works correctly select Picture in Picture and see if it plays past third event in first episode).  However, my Samsung BD-5700 downloaded an update with 1022 in the numbers and there it was - Boardwalk Empire played correctly, all menus were listed, each episode was correctly identified in the menus.  I could select features, especially the Picture in Picture feature.  I couldn't get to the website on the HBO sheet, it probably only tells you the website of each blu-ray player's manufacturer.  My recommendation is to go directly to your player maufacturer's website in the support for your product and look for/download the latest update.<br /><br />Thanks, Amazon.com, for the opportunity to review this product.  Keep up the good work.

0143034901|1.0|I can't recommend it. Perhaps it simply does not work as an audio book or lost in the translation. There is a lot of immature sex and toilet language and thoughtless males (and some females) who act without responsibility (the main theme not even truly disguised as passion and too often abuse) and immediate gratification. The characters are consistently reckless and thoughtless. It becomes tiresome. It probably didn't help that I knew who the burned man was immediately and found only one plot twist anything like surprising. There were a few good sections of writing, a few flashes of wit and some mystery but not enough. The resolution is a let down. The hokey metaphors brought on more of a \\"huh?\\" response than artistry, walking through snow that is \\"Gods dandruff\\". Too often the metaphors make an impression that detracts from the direction of the moment and there is a fair amount of repetition giving you a chance to wonder about the choice of words again. There is some suspense as the investigation proceeds, broken by long dialogues when a character tells their entire story including facts that seem implausibly known by the teller. A character would know what they themselves saw or experienced but they seem to be able to describe the intentions and hidden feelings of everyone else in that segment of the tale. It may save time but seriously chops up the story. The narrator says of Bea's father that he only expressed himself in monosyllables (unhappy with the unavoidable son-in-law), followed by a long speech by dad to the narrator expressing his love for his daughter and his concern that his soon to be son-in-law make her happy in far more than monosyllables. It might have been amusing but seems more that he forgot what he just said.<br />The audio book was fairly well read with few mistakes in characters voice. The reader's Spanish pronunciation charming.
B000RN61UI|5.0|I bought this used because this is the original copy of this book and this is the version she wanted. Even though this book is used, I would have spent so much more money on it.

B004LWZW4M|2.0|Could give it a 2.5. Worth the watching if this is your kind of thing and you don't have a really great movie waiting. A friend loaned their copy, I watched it to be polite, maybe the low expectation helped. It has the expected silly social and political commentary, the expected evil guys, the \\"apes just wanna' be friends\\" (do people never consider how vicious nature can be? Ok, forget that it complicates the thinking when you want to play on shame issues to make man the baddie when in fact in nature chimps tear each other up), and the feckless anti-hero. As mentioned by other the special effects are a little corny and sometimes seriously hokey (the apes seem far too human to start with and I have to admit I sped through some of the scenes but, hey, lots to do today and the blowing up cop cars thing isn't my thing)... but I watched it and was entertained.  In spite of it's shortcomings, it works. The story, characters and special effects are good enough, it has the kind of the sum is greater than the total of it's parts quality.  But then I was not a great fan of the first movie, it suffered too much from the style and limitations of the era.  This was well done and worth viewing.

B006W0QOF2|2.0|When the movie started I thought great this is going to be a good movie.  I kept watching but it just totally failed after the beginning scene. The plot to this movie is stupid.  It's basically a bunch of scenes strung together trying create a story.  Unfortunately it made no sense.  Very little acting was done by the main character, just repeating lines.  In several scenes the main character had long pauses where he just stared off into space and the camera just stayed on his face(Wow, great acting).  Of course maybe that was better than him saying lines because in some scenes he mumbled his lines so bad I couldn't hear or understand what he said.  The good thing about this movie is I didn't pay top dollar at the theater to see it.  Don't waste your money on this movie.
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|yes i loved it but i will not give it a perfect rating because fincher made blatant changes that i found arrogant and unnecessary. im not a director but i dont see how inanimate objects being changed is time saver. i will say that the acting was amazing. they did a great job with what they were given. my only problem was with the directing and screen writing. lisbeth was too open but im certain rooney mara acted as she was told. shes a great actress and id never say otherwise nor would i with daniel craig. i believe it should win awards left and right but i do not hold it above or below the swedish adaptation.  like most american filmmaking i believe it was over the top. I loved the score and i think it helped the film flow. i did roll my eyes at the beginning with the music and the effects during the opening credits because all i could think was \\"oh fun, theyve turned it into a music  video\\". i guess they needed something to grab the audience with and the film got past that soon enough. im happy they did an american adaptation of the girl with the dragon tattoo which has become one of my favorite books. I just hope people take the time to read the book. there were alot of things that i disagreed with in the american film but there were also things in the swedish film that i disagreed with. im happy i decided to see the american film despite my original reaction to the idea of one being made. I am gonna buy a copy of the dvd when its released to go with my other dvds of the trilogy. I wont be paying 22 bucks for it though. its over priced for a dvd thats not a special edition.
145162445X|3.0|The book is a good update on modern cosmology. Dr. Krauss presents the subject matter in a very readable and exciting way. Unfortunately he spend too much time and effort trying to make the case against religion or the existence of God for that matter.  If your already friendly towards his views you will find that part of the book to offer little new insights and if not, you will probably find his arguments unconvincing - I suspect most people reading this book will fall into the former category anyway.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Once we live, we must die.  John Green's book has an economy of beauty that is heartbreaking.  This isn't an overwrought deliberate tear-jerker that is emotionally manipulative - quite the contrary. It almost tries to persuade you to stop that crying because all of this living and suffering and dying is completely normal.  The tears weren't for the emotion, it was for the author's ability to penetrate a little into the mystery of life and our tenuous and tenacious grasp on it by the simple act of loving.

Bookmarks, highlight in multiple colors, add notes, devotional plans, easy share button to send it to my facebook, what a great way to study and share Gods word. I love the ease of switching between versions and the option to listen to some of them as well. The quality is way higher that I ever expected!

B003IWYOF4|5.0|It was a real pleasure watching this movie once again, twenty-five years after I originally saw it, while I myself was still in high school.<br />Say what you will about the late John Hughes, this particular movie somehow captured what it is to be a young person in a way that few others ever did or ever will.<br />This movie is centered around seven people:<br />The late Paul Gleason, as school principal and antagonist, Richard Vernon.<br />John Kapelos, as the surprisingly funny and canny janitor, Carl.<br />Anthony Michael Hall, as Brian Johnson, the smart, somewhat nerdy kid.<br />Emilio Estevez, as Andrew Clark, the wrestling jock.<br />Ally Sheedy, as Allison Reynolds, the proto-emo outcast girl.<br />Molly Ringwald, as Claire Standish, the designer clothes wearing princess.<br />Judd Nelson, as John Bender, the defiant kid, the one we would have called a hood back in the day.<br />Bender is a veteran of the detention routine, very well acquainted with Vernon.<br /><br />The last five characters are the students forced to come in for Saturday detention, during which Principal Vernon has given them the assignment of writing a 1,000 word essay about exactly what each of them thinks he/she really is.<br />That alone sets the tone for how bellicose Vernon is going to be, even before he starts interacting with them.<br />Bender immediately expresses his disdain for him within the first five minutes of Vernon setting the terms, with one of the funniest lines I recall in a movie: \\"Does Barry Manilow know that you raid his wardrobe?\\" winning himself yet another Saturday on the spot.<br />From there, Bender systematically sets about tormenting first Vernon, then each of the kids, focusing particularly on Claire, someone who couldn't be more his polar opposite in attitude and economic status.<br />At first, it's tough to like Bender, given his boorish treatment of first Claire, then to Brian and Andrew, but there is something charismatic about him that starts to show through, and he turns out to be surprisingly intelligent.<br />He propels the story, especially for the first two thirds, clashing with principal and kid alike, but bringing out in each something that wouldn't have emerged otherwise.<br />Claire is troubled by how her parents seem to use her against each other, and -- as is common with the popular kids -- held prisoner to her friends' dictates.<br />Allison is ignored by her parents and basically friendless at the beginning of the movie.<br />Andrew is a jock driven relentlessly by a dad obsessed with winning to the exclusion of all else.<br />Brian is quite a bit like Andrew, except both parents are obsessed with his academic achievement.<br />Then we have Bender, who proves he's not just telling stories when he memorably reenacts how he has been badly physically abused at home.<br /><br />Watching this all over again, I realize that I knew all of the characters to one extent or another in high school, and most people could identify with each to one degree or another.<br />The dialogue is biting, often witty, and nearly always sarcastic.<br />The conflict that only grows with time between Bender and Vernon propels the movie, and Bender's harsh words for each of the kids eventually get them to open up in ways they never would have done without him to berate them.<br />Because of this juxtaposition of the sarcastic with the sadness each of them has, this manages to be a very touching movie that does so without being cloying about it.<br />I won't spoil the movie for those of you who have yet to see it, but I will just say that this is no action movie or cookie cutter teen movie.<br />This is about the universal misgivings that people have throughout their lives, especially when they are young and at their most vulnerable.<br /><br />There is little doubt that Judd Nelson's Bender is the driving force here, and he is very good in that role, wildly veering from wickedly funny to exploding into rage, with only his unusually strong command of the English language making him just a bit unbelievable.<br />Ally Sheedy's Allison has the least dialogue by far, but she plays it very well, getting the maximum out of her character with her expressions and the laborious way that she speaks, as Nelson and Hall observe during the commentary track, as if she were unpracticed at speaking.<br />Hall plays Brian very well, just the type of personality of the nerdy guy, but with a nerd's sensitivity and intelligence.<br />Estevez's Andrew is in some ways even better, first playing tough guy tempered with chivalry by standing up to Bender's taunting of Claire, then showing that he really is much more than just an athlete, especially when recounting the real reason that he got put on detention with the others and when talking one-on-one with Allison.<br />Ringwald's Claire is also very good, and she is a nice foil for Bender, who quickly pivots from tweaking Vernon to making openly crude comments toward her.<br />At first, it's tough to feel too sorry for her, given her membership in the popular clique, but she emerges as someone who would prefer to be her own person, and it turns out that Bender, is the one person who brings that out more than anyone else.<br />Kapelo as Carl didn't have much time on screen, but he was a real highlight, showing that he is much more than a blue collar guy, but someone with a real understanding of human nature and wisdom.<br />Gleason as Vernon was in some ways the best of all, not just a cardboard cutout authoritarian, but someone even with just a hint of self doubt. He is particularly funny, with his impenetrable front that first Bender, then the other kids, and finally even he (unintentionally) puncture throughout the movie.<br /><br />Anyone wondering about the R rating for this should know that there is no nudity or anything of the sort, but that the reason for the rating was because of some harsh language, with some sexual comments thrown in.<br />This is a nicely packaged Blu-Ray, with both the regular movie and the audio commentary version with Anthony Michael Hall, Judd Nelson, and DVD producer Jason Hillhouse.<br />You also get a 12-part documentary titled \\"Sincerely Yours,\\" with focus placed on each of the actors, plus various other aspects of the movie itself.<br />They also include the five minute \\"The Most Convenient Definitions: The Origins of the Brat Pack,\\" a short discussion of exactly what it says, and speaking for myself, I always thought that term was unfairly dismissive, condescending, and smacked of a certain elitism of elders toward young upstarts.<br />This is a BD-Live disk, so there are some features available through it directly online, but I didn't really bother exploring those.<br /><br />Picture quality was good and certainly an improvement over conventional DVD upscaled on a 1080p set, but I was surprised at how it was slightly grainy in parts when I got up close to my 1080p TV, almost as if the producers had simply produced the Blu-Ray from the exact same resolution master from the DVD release instead of going back to the original film itself to make a Blu-Ray specific master.<br />However, the minor graininess in no way detracted from the movie, which is -- after all -- about the characters.<br />I realize that John Hughes was often derided by the elites in show business when he was still alive, and to some extent even now, but this to me is one of his two very best movies, the other being the superb [[ASIN:B002JIOOAI Planes, Trains and Automobiles (Those Aren't Pillows Edition)]].<br />I highly recommend either movie, and consider yourself lucky if it's the first time watching it.y strong command of the English language making him just a bit unbelievable.<br />Ally Sheedy's Allison has the least dialogue by far, but she plays it very well, getting the maximum out of her character with her expressions and the laborious way that she speaks, as Nelson and Hall observe during the commentary track, as if she were unpracticed at speaking.<br />Hall plays Brian very well, just the type of personality of the nerdy guy, but with a nerd's sensitivity and intelligence.<br />Estevez's Andrew is in some ways even better, first playing tough guy tempered with chivalry by standing up to Bender's taunting of Claire, then showing that he really is much more than just an athlete, especially when recounting the real reason that he got put on detention with the others and when talking one-on-one with Allison.<br />Ringwald's Claire is also very good, and she is a nice foil for Bender, who quickly pivots from tweaking Vernon to making openly crude comments toward her.<br />At first, it's tough to feel too sorry for her, given her membership in the popular clique, but she emerges as someone who would prefer to be her own person, and it turns out that Bender, is the one person who brings that out more than anyone else.<br />Kapelo as Carl didn't have much time on screen, but he was a real highlight, showing that he is much more than a blue collar guy, but someone with a real understanding of human nature and wisdom.<br />Gleason as Vernon was in some ways the best of all, not just a cardboard cutout authoritarian, but someone even with just a hint of self doubt.

B00005JMFQ|5.0|Actually..... it's all been said by others so I just want to add my vote that this is a *brilliant* movie.<br /><br />You would do well to spend an afternoon watching the interview with the director and the extended scenes; they add soooo much to the story but would have made the film four hours long, which IMO would have been a good thing.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|I first watched this film back in 2004 and it left an impression on me then that there was something special about it. Perhaps it was the soundtrack, which is one the more hauntingly beautiful ones that I have heard. Since then I have watched about half of the Studio Ghibli films (Castle In The Sky, My Neighbor Totoro, Kiki's Delivery Service, Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away, Howl's Moving Castle, and Ponyo). Though technically speaking, Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind is not a Studio Ghibli film as it was made before the founding of the Studio, it still feels like one, especially with its themes of ecological balance and living in harmony with the environment.<br /><br />Now I plan on writing a review of all the Studio Ghibli films (and watching them all), in chronological production order. Why? Because Studio Ghibli's canon of films is one of the best of the world, but also sadly not as well known in the US.<br /><br />A thousand years after the near destruction of human civilization, humanity struggles against the encroaching Toxic Jungle. Eking out lives at the edges of Toxic Jungles that are inhabited by giant insects, life remains a struggle for most. In one kingdom, the bucolic Valley of the Wind, Princess Nausicaa and her people are thrown into the maelstrom of a war when a bellicose Tolmekian (another Kingdom) warship crashes into their valley. Aboard that ship is a relic of the war that almost destroyed the Earth and human civilization 1000 years ago.<br /><br />Suddenly the peaceful Valley of the Wind and Princess Nausicaa must struggle for their existence as a war over the future of humanity and of the Earth plays out in the Valley. While events are shaping up for a war, Nausicaa learns of the secret of the Toxic Jungle and its connection to humanity. And so the future of humanity is caught between the knowledge that only Nausicaa possesses and the plans of the militaristic Tolmekians, who are set to try to destroy the Toxic Jungle.<br /><br />Ultimately this film is a great introduction to the Studio Ghibli canon. It's message about environmental collapse and environmental harmony continue to resonate almost 30 years after its creation. Not only that, it remains a beautiful story good for both adults and children.o the Studio Ghibli canon.

B0034G4P94|5.0|I heard a lot of good reviews about Warrior before I saw it, my brother said his friend saw it and made him want to go out fighting and conquer the world!  This was a fantastic movie, great acting, awesome fight scenes, good family drama between father and sons.  Nick Nolte plays their recovering alcoholic father that didn't give them the greatest childhood.  I heard Nick is supposed to be up for some award for that role too.  Tom Hardy is a BEAST in this movie, it also makes you excited for The Dark Knight Rises, because he'll be playing Bane, and probably will destroy Batman in that one, lol.  And of course, the ending...how did the ending tie everything up and make you feel?  It was perfect I thought, because Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton both fight in the MMA championship, and end up having to face each other at the end, so you're kinda routing for both of them, and thinking..\\"How can this possibly end good??\\"  But they pulled it off.  Oh, and a really gut-wrenching ending too at that, almost brings tears to your eyes.  Good stuff!  I immediately bought this after watching it the first time, and I recommend it to everybody.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|I will start with the steel of this knife. Yes it is extremely thick and heavy and strong.You would have to do something way out of the ordinary to wreck this blade. Almost built to be a small hand axe. If you could rig a longer handle for this knife you could probably use it as an axe. The durability for this price is unmatched. This knife was made to go through hell and come back. The planet could blow up and these knives would still be around with no grips attatched. This blade is not going to f*** up on you. It may not be the best knife for any one task except not to break on you when you need any blade to help you out. So to go with no fear of your knife breaking this is why people get this knife. I got this blade really sharp. not as sharp as my moraknives but then I am talking about 2 different knives completely. So the steel itself is a deal at 60 bucks. Now I am like everyone else when i say these next 2 things but it is true. The sheath sucks and the handles suck. Which is why ka bar is making a killing on the micarta handles they sell. and people will pay 100 dollars or more for a new leather sheath for this knife. I will be fair and say the kydex sheath looks nice and holds the knife well. But it is extremely difficult to get the knife out with 1 hand if you are wearing it on your belt. I do not know who at kabar gave the okay for the handles and I guess it does not matter because this knife is one of their best sellers. I own a lot of knives the grips on this knife is the worst for me. I never heard or read anyone say &#34;man I love those grips on the becker bk2&#34; Because no one says that. You can get away with the handle grips,because ergonomically the grips have a nice shape, the material is just an idiotic choice. but I made a leather sheath after trying out the kydex for a while.The belt loop is 4 inches wide and just silly.I do not know or ever seen a belt on any one 4 inches wide. you probably could stitch it. But it is still tight in the kydex sheath and extremely difficult to pull the knife out with 1 hand when on your belt. (did I say that already?).Carrying the knife on your belt is not really an option with the kydex/nylon sheath. It might be easier if it is strapped to a pack or strapped on the belt sideways. but I did not try to configure it that way.<br />UPDATE 3-18-2014 After taking the coating off and beating the crap out of this knife it earns my respect as a survival tool. I still do not think it is a knife that I would carry all the time if you go out into the wilderness or where ever. I would absolutely have it in a car or in my pack as a back up knife because if I broke my main knife I know I would have something that is going to get the job done. there are just other knives that I would rather use than this one for any task except being my back up knife. I think it is called BK2 because it will always be number 2.x sheath and extremely difficult to pull the knife out with 1 hand when on your belt.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I loved getting my Kindle Fire for Christmas, but getting the cover made the product even better.  I love the way the leather feels and it made the Kindle feel more like a book...I had no problem inserting the Kindle and don't really see why others had anything but rave reviews for this cover!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Picked this up on a recommendation from a friend of mine.  Fantastic read.  The most fun for me was when I was down to about 200 pages left and listened to the Ready Player One soundtrack on Spotify while finishing the book.  Very meta.

0525478817|5.0|It just changes your outlook on life. It's really amazing in so many ways.<br />A great story that just stays with you and makes you really consider things differently. Better.<br />Didn't read it- listened to the audio book through Audible. The narrator - Kate Rudd- was amazing. She really made the story come to life. All the characters, everything. Amazing.<br /><br />Couldn't put it down. Listened to the whole thing in two days of just listening whilst walking around my town for hours and hours.<br />Couldn't break away from it. Simply great.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|I was not lucky enough to have read the Percy Jackson and The Olympians series prior to the release of this movie (I didn't even know the series existed until this movie.) Anyway, I saw the movie in Blockbuster and thought the cover looked interesting so I rented it and I ended up loving the movie. I love this movie so much that I bought the 3 disk blu-ray version of it so I could watch it home, at my parents house and on my iPod at the gym.  Naturally, I couldn't understand why people hated this movie so I read the books. After reading The Lightening Thief I realized the movie was completely different from the book. It's almost as if Chris Columbus loosely based the movie on the book rather than direct the movie based on the book (a slap in author Rick Riordan's face.)  Regardless of how much \\"artistic license\\" he used I thought the new story line was fantastic. Even after reading the series in its' entirety I still watch the movie all the time. Would I prefer Riordan's story line to Columbus'? Yes. Since a remake is out of the question I've chosen not to boycott this movie or the next and just enjoy them for what they are.  As for Annabeth, though she does not have gray eyes and curly blonde hair, I thought Alexandra Daddario was perfect for the role of Annabeth. Daddario is a good actress that got a lot of \\"heat\\" for not having the physical attributes of Riordan's Annabeth. I hate to be so blunt but she \\"kicked some major ass as Annabeth.\\"
B005TUD2BK|5.0|I also purchased this version because it had the digital copy for iTunes or Windows versions (and at the time it was the same price as the non digital copy) but I didn't go to the website as directed by the instructions on the enclosed brochure.  I went directly to my iTunes account page in the iTunes program and at the bottom of the store screen you should see a click on link that says redeem.  Go to the redeem page through that link and then put in your code directly and that will hopefully work for you.  I just did it last night 2/5/12 and had no trouble at all redeeming my iTunes digital copy.  Hope that it works for you.  As far as the movie, enough has been said about the series this was just to help in case anyone else had issues with their digital copy.  IF for some reason you can't get the iTunes to unlock, try the windows version which would then open up under windows media player.  One thing with the windows copy, however, is that they are computer specific.  Once you redeem the code it usually it can only be played on the PC where you unlocked it (unless you have a windows enabled type of tablet or mp3 player like Zune that will allow you to view it on a portable).  GOOD LUCK!
1423140591|5.0|Few series have enthralled me as Percy Jackson and The Olympians had, and now The Heroes of Olympus. Though the series is meant for teenagers and young adults, adults will enjoy it immensely. I know I enjoyed the series.<br /><br />The Son of Neptune keeps its' readers entertained from beginning to end. I found this book to be a bit better than The Lost Hero (that was a still great book on its own though.) I thought it was better because it was suspenseful and bold, while still providing the reader with answers. Whereas in The Lost Hero, questions were answered in the last few chapters instead of throughout the novel.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to children and adults alike. If you choose to read The Heroes of Olympus series, you really need to read the Percy Jackson and the Olympians series otherwise certain situations will be completely misunderstood.<br /><br />As for all those journalists and aspiring writers, Riordan's writing is top-notch. He is an outstanding writer that has a knack for writing complex feelings and putting them into simple sentences (it is supposed to be a young adult novel, so simple is best.)
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Not my typical read and to be honest, the description didn't do it justice. I gave it a shot due to the outstanding number of reviews and I have to say that this is one of the best series I've read in a long time. I have flown through all 5 books and am relishing the last couple of chapters with a heavy heart knowing that it will soon end. I was not only surprised at the plot, but the characters are vividly stunning and the writing soared above expectations. I'm not really a romance reader and hadn't read any of Ms. Moning's Highlander series and I just wasn't expecting for her tale to suck me in so quickly and thoroughly and spit me out wanting more. Commendations to Ms. Moning on a series well done. I will be checking out more of her delicious tales. This series will stay with me for a long time. LOVED IT!!
1400079276|4.0|A mix of Stephen King and Rod Serling, with a little Oedipus Rex thrown into the mix.  A work of post-modern fiction in the classic Twilight Zone fashion, Kafka on the Shore is the story of Kafka Tamura as he finds the components of himself, and discovers who he is, where he came from, and why he is the way he is.<br /><br />Without spoiling the plot, Tamura's life intersects with a number of strange characters - a gay transgendered man, a reserved librarian, a ninteen year old girl with a secret, a trucker, two Japanese soldiers from the Second World War, an idiot savant who converses with cats and stones, and a couple of commercial characters named Johnny Walker and Colonel Sanders.<br /><br />The book itself is a compelling read, with the \\"page turner\\" moniker none too far fetched.  While there are a number of loose and dead ends as the novel wraps, you get the feeling that this is by design rather than omission.  If you like fiction in the truest sense - fiction that will entertain and also make you think - Kafka on the Shore is a great read.
0062082353|5.0|One of the most exciting books that I have read in quite some time.  Had a hard time putting it down to get chores done but, gave me time to reflect on just what type of men we have in this country and the women that they are married to.  Made me so very proud.

B006VA57CY|5.0|This is magnificant and when viewed on my Kindle FIRE it can't get better. The picture is much better and sharper on the really small screen and you almost feel like you are in the rooms and part of the story. The story is interesting and filled with subplots. And like so many of the PBS Masterpiece Theater shows, it is one I hope to keep to watch again and again.  This is also excellent ala the picture on my iPad 2 although I do prefer the FIRE.  I also dLoaded All Creatures Great and Small....so much better than on the TV screen and again one of my all time favorites. These are so well done that I am afraid I stay up til late morning hours watching these shows. Yes...I would recommend this series to everyone. Oh, I also purchased this with my trial Prime Membership. I am now a paid member of Prime Membership and will renew when the time comes. The savings on shipping and the cost of the series with Prime is well worth the membership fee. Only a member for a couple of months and have already saved money.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|An investigation where there are no clues left to find, little if any cooperation from those around you, any of whom could be the killer you are looking for. What's the plan? Is there one?<br /><br />  Mikael Blomkvist (played by Daniel Craig) is co-owner and writer for Millennium magazine and has recently suffered a professional setback that could bankrupt him and his publication. An unscrupulous man with alleged criminal dealings has won a libel suit that might end his career. Soon after, however, Henrik Vanger (played by Christopher Plummer) makes him an offer. Find out who is responsible for the disappearance and likely death of his niece Harriet 40 years earlier. He also believes that whoever's responsible is a member of his family. The family that lives on the same large estate they did during the disappearance and somehow manage to avoid speaking to each other. Blomkvist is promised a substantial salary in addition to evidence that will bring about the demise of the man who brought the libel suit against him. When he asks if he might employ a research assistant, Vanger's (Plummer's) lawyer recommends the woman who did the background check on Blomkvist before they hired him. A troubled loner with a peculiar appearance by the name of Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara).<br /><br />  Now I have no doubt that the books on which this film and its 2009 Swedish language predecessor were based on are better than the movie. Not because I've read them. In actuality, I haven't read a book since high school. But since people who do read the books first ALWAYS say that the book is better, then it must be the case. It couldn't possibly be an effort on their part to sound and feel superior. Putting that aside, Craig as Blomkvist was a surprisingly wise choice and Plummer, along with others, make for an intriguing, albeit despicable Vanger family. But the real star is Rooney Mara as the brilliant, beautiful, and unstable Lisbeth. Despite a few small roles in other films and guest appearances in numerous television series, Mara's most recognized for her performance in The Social Network. That role was child's play compared to Lisbeth. This is truly a breakout performance that, one would hope, could bring a slew of bigger roles and a long successful career.and guest appearances in numerous television series, Mara's most recognized for her performance in The Social Network.

B005FVFWOI|5.0|Well, write something about Aqualung is just...let's say useless. It's just a masterpiece, period.  But about special editions I have to say that I own the 25th anniversary edition  (re-mastered using something called the Prism Sound  Super Noise Shaping System or so)  but it looks like actual pieces of art are more human than not technological  and Mr. Steven Wilson re-mixed fot the 40th anniversary (using technology for sure technology , but with a brilliant human touch)  had transformed this classic into something unique.  In times of compressed MP3s it's amazing to find something like this and it's a true pleasure to sit down in from of your stereo system, get some nice wine and enjoy this marvel with this pristine yet faithful sound.  You feel it's different, it sounds much better  but you can be sure it's genuine Aqualung.  If you haven't been introduced to Steven Wilson's Music take a look to Porcupine Tree, Blackfield or his solo projects...

1612130585|5.0|I have read the 1st of the trilogy by EL James as well as this 2nd book.  Both were to my liking. In fact, I personally feel these books should become required reading (primers, if you will) for all females having sexual intercourse/ sexual relations.  These 2 books, plus the last of the trilogy, have opened my eyes to what I had been missing all these years.  I have blossomed sexually because of these books and even attended a signing by the author in NYC, at which I expressed my gratitude to her.  What I'd like to know now is when is the movie coming out?  FYI - As much as some of the women at the book signing referred to this trilogy as soft-porn, I beg to differ...There were no images of tacky 80's music or poor story lines associated with these books, only a sense of \\"over-fulfillment\\" as the main female character says somewhere in the series.  Thank you again, EL James...I have a new nightstand companion.

B005B0QYMM|5.0|This flick really surprised me.  I'm so glad I took a chance on this one.  Flicks like this and The Hazing (2004) inspire me to continue taking chances when Netflix or Amazon throws a weird suggestion my way.  I give this a direct-to-DVD horror \\"A\\".<br /><br />This movie operates much like The Last Exorcism (2010).  We follow Lance Preston and his Ghost Hunters film crew into a haunted mental hospital in search of the paranormal.  It comes off as a satire, with a lot of sophomoric sarcasm and a totally fake medium.  They laugh about things being \\"too over the top\\" between cuts and they pay a gardener twenty bucks to lie about seeing a ghost on the property.  This works out fantastically!  Normally the first 20-30 minutes of any horror are painful.  They have barely-trained actors and a perfunctory storyline.  Grave Encounters, however, has good acting and draws a lot of smiles as we learn about the film crew.  This also serves as a superior directorial device to engage the viewers into caring about these characters.<br /><br />The story is simple and certainly nothing new.  The crew locks themselves into the abandoned hospital from 10pm-6am, giving them eight hours in total darkness to catch some paranormal activity on film.  They get a tour from the caretaker and hear a few \\"real\\" ghost stories about the place to hype up their show (called Grave Encounters) and choose where to place static cameras.<br /><br />The execution is more like the Paranormal Activity films (2007, 2010, 2011).  There's a lot of slow tension build-up and you find yourself concentrating on the screen; staring waiting for something to move and listening for a subtle sound (like White Noise (2005)).  This is a style that I love, but many people don't like this.<br /><br />What caught me off guard is that while everything was done surprisingly well in terms of acting, effects, sets, scares, and directing, the writing seemed very misguided.  Not the dialogue, but the events.  At first things seem sensible.  Some random objects move here and there.  But as the movie progresses and the intensity of the paranormal activity amplifies, the events seem less connected.  The writers mix elements of \\"ghost\\" movies with elements of \\"house\\" movies.  In the movie, Lance explains that there are static and intelligent hauntings.  Static haunting account for the \\"house\\" movie subgenre, in which there is an energy echoing a past event (but there is no specific ghost, demon or spirit).  Intelligent hauntings are our \\"ghost\\" story subgenre, in which a paranormal entity has some motivation and responds to human presence.  In most horror movies, the writing will choose one subgenre or the other.  Really never both.<br /><br />Anyway, this subgenre combo doesn't work.  People start disappearing or dying and we don't know why.  Some weird things happen that make me want to guess \\"why this is happening\\" or \\"what the ghost wants\\" or \\"what happened in the hospital\\" or \\"are the crew members somehow linked to the hospital?\\"  Ultimately, I was hit with a lot of red herrings which served no end.  As a result, the end of the movie was simply when we ran out of people to kill or mysteriously disappear.  I wanted a little more.<br /><br />Despite this big overall writing flaw, each individual scene worked well.  I enjoyed every five minute piece of the movie.  But after the first 30 minutes, the scenes just failed to make a story when assembled chronologically.<br /><br />However critical I may sound, I really enjoyed this and strongly recommend it to any of you who enjoy occasionally taking a chance on an unknown direct-to-DVD horror.e and there.

B003Q6D25K|5.0|DISCLAIMER:  I loved, loved, loved Paranormal Activity.  If you didn't, then don't watch this.  This was made for people who liked the original.  The people involved in making this flick saw no need to modify that which a lot of folks already liked.  So here we go...<br /><br />In any movie where we, the audience, will watch a group of people under emotional duress it is the screenwriter and director's job to have us identify with them somehow; humanize them.  So let's meet the players.  This family has QUITE a house (much like the pleasantly affluent couple in Paranormal Activity).  The man of the house has not one but two--TWO--man caves!!!!  The first-born daughter is a hand full.  I was looking forward to the lines that would pour out of that sassy mouth.  How does such a child get raised?  Well, that double-man-caving husband coupled with a wife who clearly never plans on doing a diaper.  And why bother?  She has a Latin nanny to whom she may delegate at will.  The nanny tends to the baby, their infant son, who dad thinks will favor father-son Chargers games over video games as he enters adolescence.  Good luck with that bonding, dad!  Relating with this American portrait yet?<br /><br /> This family is living the American dream.  A McMansion of a house, a nanny, an adorable baby, sunny California BBQ's by the pool, and a dog that doesn't seem to bark, bite, drool or hump anything.  I don't want it to end.  The father even quotes Highlander while dunking his nephew in the pool.  \\"There can be only ONE!\\"  Perfect.  A little too perfect?<br /><br /> BAM!  The house is dilapidated!  It looks like they owed a hurricane money and it took it out on their interior decorating.  Without being any less intriguing for it, we find ourselves playing the exact same game as I did during the first Paranormal Activity.  We listen for strange noises.  We focus our eyes on random objects trying to convince ourselves whether or not they're moving ever so slightly.  When the dog stirs, stares or barks, we try to see what the dog is focusing on.  We get involved and otherwise meaningless security-cam footage of an uneventful house becomes a suspenseful ocular-sleuthing marathon.  Kudos to the filmmakers for taking me on this journey.  The movie develops from that point on and, well, you should know the kinds of things that follow.<br /><br /> Completely off-topic, but the Latin maid speaks very little English, however she talks quite a bit.  No subtitles are offered to the audience when she speaks Spanish (to herself, in panic, in prayer, etc.).  But if you understand what she's saying, the movie is actually even more interesting.  Even more interesting than if they gave subtitles...because you know that you caught something that wasn't meant for everyone in the audience.  As I found myself understanding it I stopped to wonder how monolingual Americans would react to these indecipherable mutterings--would the mood be different?  No subtitles was a brilliant call.  Also, adding not only a dog OR a baby, but both, was a great call.  You'll find that you watch the baby much in the same way that you watch the dog.  They're both like windchime-harbingers of strange goings-on.<br /><br /> I really enjoyed watching this movie.  There were times when I was watching the screen SOOOO carefully with my eyes darting about at details like a devout Ghost Hunter.

Completely off-topic, but the Latin maid speaks very little English, however she talks quite a bit.  No subtitles are offered to the audience when she speaks Spanish (to herself, in panic, in prayer, etc.).  But if you understand what she's saying, the movie is actually even more interesting.  Even more interesting than if they gave subtitles...because you know that you caught something that wasn't meant for everyone in the audience.  As I found myself understanding it I stopped to wonder how monolingual Americans would react to these indecipherable mutterings--would the mood be different?  No subtitles was a brilliant call.  Also, adding not only a dog OR a baby, but both, was a great call.  You'll find that you watch the baby much in the same way that you watch the dog.  They're both like windchime-harbingers of strange goings-on.   I really enjoyed watching this movie.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I stumbled across the anthology and picked it up on my Kindle.  I couldn't put it down once I started reading.  Not that I'm some literary expert, but it reminded me of Alas, Babylon which is one of my favorite post-apocalyptic books.  It's definitely worth checking out.  I hope to see lots more from Hugh Howey!  Keep up the great work sir!
B003Q6D25U|5.0|DISCLAIMER:  I loved, loved, loved Paranormal Activity.  If you didn't, then don't watch this.  This was made for people who liked the original.  The people involved in making this flick saw no need to modify that which a lot of folks already liked.  So here we go...<br /><br />In any movie where we, the audience, will watch a group of people under emotional duress it is the screenwriter and director's job to have us identify with them somehow; humanize them.  So let's meet the players.  This family has QUITE a house (much like the pleasantly affluent couple in Paranormal Activity).  The man of the house has not one but two--TWO--man caves!!!!  The first-born daughter is a hand full.  I was looking forward to the lines that would pour out of that sassy mouth.  How does such a child get raised?  Well, that double-man-caving husband coupled with a wife who clearly never plans on doing a diaper.  And why bother?  She has a Latin nanny to whom she may delegate at will.  The nanny tends to the baby, their infant son, who dad thinks will favor father-son Chargers games over video games as he enters adolescence.  Good luck with that bonding, dad!  Relating with this American portrait yet?<br /><br /> This family is living the American dream.  A McMansion of a house, a nanny, an adorable baby, sunny California BBQ's by the pool, and a dog that doesn't seem to bark, bite, drool or hump anything.  I don't want it to end.  The father even quotes Highlander while dunking his nephew in the pool.  \\"There can be only ONE!\\"  Perfect.  A little too perfect?<br /><br /> BAM!  The house is dilapidated!  It looks like they owed a hurricane money and it took it out on their interior decorating.  Without being any less intriguing for it, we find ourselves playing the exact same game as I did during the first Paranormal Activity.  We listen for strange noises.  We focus our eyes on random objects trying to convince ourselves whether or not they're moving ever so slightly.  When the dog stirs, stares or barks, we try to see what the dog is focusing on.  We get involved and otherwise meaningless security-cam footage of an uneventful house becomes a suspenseful ocular-sleuthing marathon.  Kudos to the filmmakers for taking me on this journey.  The movie develops from that point on and, well, you should know the kinds of things that follow.<br /><br /> Completely off-topic, but the Latin maid speaks very little English, however she talks quite a bit.

B005T87QCI|5.0|I love this app. I got this on my kindle fire. I cant stop playing it. it is my favorite game ever.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|When a movie can seize our attention during the opening credits and maintain it throughout--well, we're in for something good.  An impressive score, ominous but beautiful cinematography and exquisite camerawork transform this movie from \\"decent\\" to a very different and enjoyable experience.  It strikes me as well-written and well-acted by a team of underrated actors.  It's not gruesome or horrifying, but it kept me on my toes and, more importantly, kept my attention continuously.  This expanded one-act is a gem in an era where moviemakers place more attention in trailer-editing than movie production.  [B+ ]<br /><br /> Folks, let's give credit where it's due.  If you skipped this movie just because Shyamalan's name was attached to it then you made a mistake.  I'll start by pointing out a key difference between this Shyamalan movie and all others: Shyamalan wrote it but did not direct it.  All of his other movies, which admittedly went downhill after The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, were both written and directed by him.  I'd also like to point out that the ideas for all of his movies had the potential to be great--really great.  But for any movie you need not only a proven director, but the right director for the movie in question.  I think they got the director right on this one:  John Erick Dowdle, who directed Quarantine, the American adaptation of the Latin phenom [REC].<br /><br /> The movie opens with a cautionary tale about the Devil, who occasionally gathers a group of ill-fated humans to torture them one by one before stealing them away to Hell.  Cut to the opening credits we see an impressive metropolitan cityscape showcased in a distorted, upside down view to set a mood of unease--or excitement for movie thrill-seekers.  The score, as if architected to accelerate heart rates, complements the visual overtones well.  I am immediately on my toes, waiting to pick out the wolf-in-sheep's-clothing before a single hits the screen.<br /><br /> The characters include a bereft, alcoholic detective who doubts his ability forgive, two elevator-surveillance security guards, two attractive twenty-somethings (a man and a woman), a floor security guard, a testy old woman, and a well-dressed  mattress salesman.  The game starts when we see the latter five step onto the elevator.  From this moment on, a talented movie analyst might be auditing each character's wardrobe for red or anything \\"diabolical\\".  But red is found on the attire of a few of them, as well as hints of red on the fabric walls of the elevator, one character's hair, the lit buttons and the digital floor number display.  Nothing is obvious, which makes random suspicions free game!<br /><br />Interspersed with the director's attempts to bait us into snap judgments as to who is \\"the Devil\\" are elevated shots of the city, some with views looking straight up or ominously down the side of their reflective, windowed surface and others shuttling through the elevator shaft.  The devout, Latin security guard (who has been doubling as an effective narrator) chimes in with his theological fears or additional details to the story which opened the movie.  As tension rises, we are left to wonder if the five on the elevator are the only people gathered by the Devil, or if the detective and surveillance security were carefully chosen as well.<br /><br />Suspicions shift readily and regularly.  We periodically learn new details about the characters which could be hints or red herrings.  Expressions of fear, accusation, anger and disgust festoon the faces of our elevator players.  In screenwriting they say that you don't put a gun on the wall in Act One unless it's going to fire in Act Three.  Let's just say it feels like this wall belongs to the NRA president.<br /><br />This movie was fun and unique.  As serial-moviegoers isn't that what we want?  Something different and enjoyable?  Something that doesn't feel like a recycled idea with a new director and different actors?  If you feel the same way, then give Shyamalan a mulligan and try this movie out!l the same way, then give Shyamalan a mulligan and try this movie out!
B002N9MK8G|5.0|I've listened to the record a few times, and every time I listen I am simply astounded.  This is Sinatra at his absolute finest.  I only ask that when you listen, you listen from start to finish.  I really felt like I was at the concert and could see him up there singing and telling jokes, with Quincy Jones, Basie, and co. backing him up.
0553381695|5.0|In short, if you loved A Game of Thrones you will love A Clash of Kings, and by the same token if you weren't such a fan of A Game of Thrones, this book probably won't grab you either, but it could. Whereas A Game of Thrones focused more on the political intrigue and ended with omens of war, this book starts and ends with the war raging. I found the story becomes more complicated, as we hear more about Stannis Baratheon (who spent all of the last book in Dragonstone, away from the main conflict) and more and more people join the struggle for the Iron Throne. If you were a huge fan of Danaerys Targaryen's story, you might be disappointed, as I found her story to be both short and a little confusing, but it had enough substance to hold my interest, and it ends with the promise of more action in the next book. I kind of wished it had tied up some storylines, but of course this is second in a series of five, so it makes sense that a lot of storylines and even parts of storylines remain open. Another masterpiece that continues what I consider to be one of the best series I've read in a while and definitely worth reading if the first book interests you at all. The final 100 or so pages especially are one of the more epic scenes in the series so far.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|I am a pretty protective mom. I was watching this movie on my Ipad, streaming. My son and I came in at the part where the characters get onto the ski lift at night. Well, we both watched the rest of the movie and it was great. Very, very suspenseful and from then on at least, no sex, no nudity, not the worst language. Now, there is a scene or two which a younger child or one that is more freaked/grossed out might not enjoy it, so beware there.<br /><br />Otherwise, I think this is a good movie for just about anyone. I plan to watch it again with my husband and older son. I kind of want to compare it with Speed (the movie with Keeanu Reeves) because it kept you wondering what was going to happen, how they were going to get out of their predicament. Also, there was really interesting character development as time went along. While a lot of the movie was these folks on a chair lift, it never got boring. It was like watching an episode of I Shouldn't Be Alive, but in full movie form.<br /><br />I recommend this movie. I think it's going to be fun to re-watch it tonight with blankets, hot cocoa and the house a little chilly!
B005T87QCI|4.0|I'd get this app now when it's $0.99. It's a decent fighter with a difficult style. You have to duck and block and throw punches like in a boxing game. It adds difficulty and prevents it from being a mindless button-masher. It's not bad, but could be better.
0062082353|5.0|I found this book a very compelling read.  The world that Chris Kyle was a part of is hard to imagine. I can understand the frustration of professionals like himself who have been trained at the elite level being sent to the battlefield having to meticulously take notes on the manner in which they utilize their training.  We have trained these men to be the elite, silent professionals yet we question their judgement in the battlefield?  How Washington 'suits' determine the activities on the ground is hard to understand, most probably NEVER seeing through the 'scope' of anything other than furthering their careers at the taxpayers expense.  The idea that we have such brave individuals defending this country makes me feel proud to know that there are those who still want to defend the freedoms that so many of us take for granted in this country.  Thank God for men like Kyle.  His bravery under battle is to be commended.  I salute him.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is a very good app. I have used both Weatherbug and The Weather Channel apps, but this app is easier to use with a smoother interface.
1595825045|5.0|This book is a must own for any fan of Avatar, or modern art for that matter. The art is spectacular, and it really is interesting having some insight to the process of making this classic television show. The quality of the book itself is great as well, it has a sturdy hardcover binding and the image quality is fantastic. There is a reason this book has no one star reviews, that's because there is nothing negative to say about it. It's a great buy, not to be missed by anyone who calls themself a fan.
1590171993|2.0|I was looking forward to reading this book after all the reviews. While it was well written and the characters are well developed, I found it pretty boring and wondering why I had spent the time finishing it by the time I got to the end.
0525478817|5.0|I'm a pretty normal teenage girl, and i don't read very much at all because nothing seams to catch my attention. \\"The Fault In Our Stars\\" on the other hand was fantastic. I read it in 2 days (not normal for me at all) and would recommend it to anyone and everyone i know (and i do).  Its in my top three books along with \\"Paper Towns\\" and \\"An Abundance Of Katherines\\" both other John Green books, he has inspired me to read more and he is a very talented writer.
B005F6NA5G|2.0|You'd think that with a title like GUITAR MAN, Benson would be returning to his roots as, arguably, one of the greatest jazz guitarists of all time, but you'd be wrong.  True, if you listen hard enough, you can hear lots of talent and chops buried beneath layers of smooth jazz dross, but this album seems more suitable as elevator music.  It makes me yearn for his early playing days as heard on COOKBOOK, or on recordings with Jack McDuff, or even on CTI, which in comparison to this, sounds absolutely cutting edge.  Not that I begrudge Benson his due.  After all, smooth jazz, a genre which he helped create (BREEZIN') made him a wealthy man after years of paying dues.  I'd just like to hear him once again in a real jazz context such as the recording he made some years back with Jimmy Smith and Grady Tate (I think his last true jazz recording).  Some bright spots are the solo pieces, TENDERLY and DANNY BOY, and of course, Benson's vocals are always first rate, but it would be nice to hear a little more guitar from the \\"guitar man\\".
1400052181|4.0|I wanted to give this 3 stars however I did learn a lot about the issues of medical and cell cultures and testing.  I say 3 stars because I found most of the medical history informative and yet very dry.  If it weren't for the personal stories of Lacks and her family I'd have fallen asleep.  Again I did learn alot and I am unsure how it could have been relayed anymore interestingly, but still dry, and yet critical to the overall understanding of the Lacks family experience.  I very much enjoyed the Lacks family personal narrative, and it is something I'm happy to have experience.  I see it has many 5 stars and 4 stars.  As I said I'd have made it 3 stars had I not learned a great deal about medical history.  The generational ramifications were slow in manifesting yet harsh and life long.  For example at one point the children of Mrs. Lacks are mistreated/abused and part of that is they get 1 biscuit per day to eat.  How do the nutritional deficits eventually manifest via cognitive capability?  That is just one example.  I would recommend it but just know it's up and down.
B001DE29SS|5.0|I bought this movie after seeing some of Chaplins silent movies on turner classic movies. I have never seen them before and i enjoyed them so much. Even my kids enjoyed them. I wanted to know about Charlies life and this movie was wonderfuly written and Robert Downey Jr. did an amazing job. There were times during the movie where I forgot it was him. The ending is great as it tells what happened to everyone in his life. and it was also interesting to know that Charlies Daughter in real life played his mother in the movie.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|As the title suggests this is so much better than the 2005 film version.  When you go to see a musical, the most important thing to be impressed with is the singing and I was blown away by the entire cast.  The music is still timeless and as good as it was 25 years ago.  And although it is difficult to appreciate the specticle since it was a filmed version of a stage show I can just imagine what it would have been if you were able to see it live.  10+++ stars if I can give it more.  If you had a choice between watching this version or the film, there is no choice, watch this one.

B00447G29S|5.0|I bought this movie soon after purchasing the Panasonic 50\\" 3-D TV. Sat down with my 5 grand children and were all capitvated by this clever exiting & entertaing Christmas story.
0385344228|5.0|At the start of \\"Defending Jacob,\\" Andy Barber, recently an assistant district attorney, is facing the grand jury and we realize that something terrible has happened.<br /><br />Neal Loguidice is questioning Barber about accepting the case of Ben Rafkin's murder when Ben was a schoolmate of Andy's fourteen-year-old son, Jacob.<br /><br />Andy had been a successful assistant district attorney in surburban Massachusetts for years. As the story progresses, things begin to unravel and the comfortable life that Andy had, begins to shatter.<br /><br />His son, Jacob, is accused of the crime but Andy thinks that is nonsense. Andy's deliberate approach to solving the crime begins to look like he wasn't giving the case his full attention and should have given the case to another assistant district attorney due to a possible conflict of interest.<br /><br />Loguidice's blind ambition becomes apparent as he creates enough uncertainty so Andy is put on paid leave and Loguidice is given the prosecution.<br /><br />How far would a father go to protect his son? This is a question that arises in the book. Andy has no doubt that Jacob is innocent. Then, Andy makes mistakes by questioning Jacob's friends after Andy had been taken off the case.<br /><br />There is not only lip biting suspense but more. This is a story that grabs at the reader's heart and squeezes as we consider what we would have done in a similar situation.<br /><br />Fans of Scott Turow will be entertained by the courtroom mystery. William Landy is a storyteller at his peak. The dialogue is exceptional and as Andy speaks, it is as if we are beside him, experiencing the moment.<br /><br />The concluding moments of this novel are such that the reader will need to pause in order to catch their breath.<br /><br />\\"Defending Jacob\\" is a powerful novel that shouldn't be missed.<br /><br />4 1/2 stars moving up to 5.
1423140591|5.0|This book was very well-written. I felt it described every place so well I felt I was there. The book starts off in California where the \\"Gorgons\\" are chasing Percy, and Percy finds his way to \\"Camp Jupiter.\\" He is first seen as an enemy and is not well trusted, but after a while he is given a quest to go save Death. His friends, Frank Zhang and Hazel LeBlanc, are loyal to him throughout the book and are very helpful. Frank finds out something about his family heritage and saves Percy a number of times. Hazel is stuck between two time periods and has visions that she is back in the past.<br /> Gaea, the Earth Titan, is trying to claim what is \\"rightfully hers\\" by taking back earth and taking down Olympus. Frank, Hazel, and Percy are sent on a quest to stop her and unchain \\"Death\\" from his prison, allowing the enemies to die. Everyone in this story finds something out about themselves that they didn't know before. Percy brings two camps together the Roman and the Greek, \\"Camp Jupiter\\" and \\"Camp Half-Blood\\" to save the world. I recommend this book because of its amazing twists and its amazing storyline.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I really like this game. You start off with a selection of four races (male and female) and four classes. Multiple choices for faces, skin color, and hair. It's pretty close to a fully featured mmorpg and lots of interesting quests. Top level is 60, and I'm on level 57. The only bad thing is that when updates happen, it takes near two weeks for the upgrade to go through the amazon app store due to their stringent guidelines.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|When I saw this movie I liked it a lot..Its not high art or anything. But as  a good movie to for those who really don't look into any kind of deep meaning as so many other films these days try for.I liked it.Watching a movie is not a thing you get from the talk of so called film critics.Its what  you get when you watch it by yourself. Like i said. Flawed .. oh yes..But to give you a joy to watch and not care what the person to your left or right care. I find it perfect. A good watch and a flight of the dark side of the galaxy

B000067FP8|5.0|Gizmo the adorable Mogwai is back, and once again, he accidentally gets wet and produces another army of hideous, mayhem instigating Gremlins. This time, however, the setting is a high-rise \\"smart building\\" in New York City owned by developer and media mogul Daniel Clamp (a play on Donald Trump and Ted Turner), for whom Billy and fiance Katie, the human heroes of the first film, now work. Old friends are soon reunited in time to try and prevent the creatures from escaping the building at sundown, when they would be free to run amok on the city, and then the world. This isn't the expect, larger scale retread of the first film, however, \\"Gremlins 2: The New Batch\\", is in fact a satire of the original and sequels in general. This time around, it's more cartoony comedy than ever, and literally anything can happen, including extreme 4th wall breaking jokes and full-on Gremlin musical numbers. We also get to see mutations! Extreme Gremlin mutations! It's great stuff, potentially enjoyable even for folks who did not like the much darker and more serious first film.<br /><br />Gremlins 2 brings back some of the original's great cast, including the main stars, charmingly small-town Zach Galligan and that ever angelic dreamgirl-next-door, Phoebe Cates, not to mention horror and B-movie fan fave Dick Miller, and Howie Mandell as the voice of Gizmo, and it also adds to it the film stealing talents of Hammer legend Christopher Lee and master of sleazy exec roles, John Glover (as Daniel Clamp). The film is once again scored by Jerry Goldsmith with effects by Rick Baker and direction by Joe Dante. Joe Dante is a name that always rings in my head as one of the greats, and yet today I was inspired to take a look at his filmography as a director. Okay, honestly, I haven't seen most of his stuff, and some of it, like Small Soldiers, was pretty underwhelming. However, the man did bring us the first \\"Gremlins\\", along with two other favorite films of mine, \\"The Howling\\" and the underrated comedic masterpiece, \\"The Burbs\\". Plus, one of the best TV shows ever, \\"Eerie Indiana\\". Not to mention \\"Looney Tunes: Back in Action\\". Hey, if you enjoy the Looney Tunes, give it a chance. It is really enjoyable (much better than Space Jam, which only had two things going for it beyond seeing all the Looney Tunes together at the same time: Bill Murray and the drool inducing Lola Bunny). He also gave us \\"Amazon Women on the Moon\\", which I can see hints of in the general feeling of \\"Gremlins 2\\", once the film really gets underway.<br /><br />So, basically, Gremlins 2 starts out as a believably normal follow-up to the first film, aside from the bookends of Looney Tunes animation that I \\"get\\" but probably don't really work as intended. However, it quickly becomes a very random comedy version of what we saw in the first film in a setting that can allow for almost anything to happen. It's very entertaining and very funny, and it should be pleasing to most fans of the first if they aren't going to get frustrated about not having a more serious Gremlins sequel. Honestly, I can understand that feeling. The first film, in my opinion, is one of the best films ever, and I actually think a serious sequel could have worked. At least once. This route they chose could have been better suited to a Gremlins 3, I believe. However, ignoring that, there is enough story follow-up from the first that hopefully the hardcore fans can appreciate this one as well. As wild as things get, it's still holds to the plot of Billy and Katie reuniting with Gizmo and working together to stop another Gremlin outbreak. And as much as the apparently sequel hating Dante felt the original film ended well enough to not need a sequel (which is why he made this one a send up of sequels), there was talk in the end of the first about Billy and Gizmo reuniting one day, if I recall correctly.  So, here we go! \\"Gremlins 2\\" is a great film, lots of fun with randomness and continuity working well together.<br /><br />The DVD release is pretty sweet too. There are deleted scenes with optional commentary, a full feature commentary by Dante, Galligan, and Producer Michael Finnell, the theatrical trailer, a gag reel, a quirky behind the scenes documentary, and an excellent widescreen presentation. All that's lacking is the option to watch the home video release version of the film, which uses an alternate scene for one of the gags. It's definitely something that NEEDS to be included on future releases, but otherwise, this is an excellent DVD to pick up! I highly recommend it! Now, I'm off to play with my NECA dancing Gizmo toy.

B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Bought a new charger. Didnt work, the battery wouldnt be recognized by mouse. There is really no excuse for this not to work right out of the box. Is there no quality control? Also the rechargeable battery is too large for the latest version of the mighty mouse. You can insert the battery, but you can't get it out without some sort of tool. Its very obvious that you have not been testing this product with the latest mice.
B0070Z4M4I|1.0|It has been a long time since I have done a rant & I haven't done many reviews lately cause I have been reviewing old WCW Pay Per Views. I will do 2002 in film & 20 years ago on my other account. But I'm going to review a movie that wasn't wanted & wasn't needed at all. As you know it's this movie The Thing prequel, premake preboot it is what it is it's a back door remake. Let me tell you all why this movie was completebulls h i t. Back iin 2004 John Carpenter wanted to do a sequel to The Thing Universal said no Carpenter said this to Empire Magazine in October of 04 \\"I have a great story for part 2 which kicks off with the 2 characters left alive from the last movie. I'm interested in doing it. Unfortantly I dont't think Universal is. Well there interested in doing it but there not interested in having me direct it! You know that the studio will end getting some commercials hotshot to direct it & that will be that. I don't care I'm certaintly not going to beg. Despite the fact that these people don't even get The Thing even though it is it's a favorite film of my own.\\" He's right they got some tool in Mattijs van Henijnigen like the drink only not spelled the same. This gy has directed Zien & Red Rain Red Rain was a short film from 96. Zien was a musical from 2004 he has about as much credibillity directing a horror movie let alone a prequel to 1 of the best horror movies ever made as George Tillman did directing an action movie. So Universal said no NO! To a sequel directed by John Carpenter & Kurt Russell & Keith David returning in favor of a prequel. I'm sorry I hate prequels imo there not needed the only time a prequel is good is if it's Missing In Action 2, Psycho IV, He l lraise Bloodline which serves as a sequel & a prequel both or Terminalor Salvation which again is a prequel & sequel both. The movie stars Mary Elizabeth Weinstead as Kate Lloyd & I'd be lying if I said she was complete s h i t but I didn't care about her character 1 way or the other. Also stars Joel Edgerton as Sam Carter, Ulrich Thmpsen  as Dr Sander Halverson & Eric Christen Olsen as Adam, Now if you love this movie & think it is a wonderful companion piece then be my guest but don't try to comment & tell that it's good this is my opinion. Ok so you start off these 3 Norwegians have discovered an Alien Body frozen in the ice & right off the bat you have 1 of these Norweigians tell a joke. \\"A man & a woman are doing it 1 night & there young son comes in & is horrified. The Woman says what do we do? Then the man says I'll take care of this. The man finds his son on top of his Grandmother & he tells his dad it ain't so funny when it's your mother.\\" I pause right there & I stared cussing I was like WTF!? But then you're introduced to Kate Lloyd & the guy from NCIS LA & Dr Halverson. The Norwegians have found something so The Norwegians need an American to go to Antartica to tell them with the proper tools it will take half a day.. Really it's to have the final girl. I wouldn't know that was taking place in 1982 if it didn't say so at the beginning. Kate is listening to Who Could It Be Now by Men At Work cause it has to do with paranoia that's so brillant ha ha. The opening reminds me of AvP in it's look & feel cause they found something in Antartica & you have your Ellen Ripley knock off, So these group of Americans go to Antartica they get The Alien out of the ice & I swear to G o d you mean to tell me that they couldn't even get a real block of ice the had to use CGI. So there celebrating the find you have this guy looking at the ice some other guy comes from behind & says boo. Literally he says boo. So the creature breaks through the ice then you have that guy run down the hall in the same exact way as in The 82 film & you have a dog biting on the cage. You have these people looking for The Thing a tentical goes through this 1 guy & pulls in they set it on fire & kill it & try to figure out what is going on & this is the only time you get pratical effects when they have the body on the table so you have Kate who took a blood sample she finds out  that it can copy human cells perfecly just like this movie perfectly copies The 82 film. When they were looking at creature they had burned they found a metal object in it & it was from that guy that was killed earlier cause he had surgery on his arm. So later on this guy got sick he has to be taken out of the area Kate finds some teeth fillings in the bathroom cause The Thing can't assimlate metal. She tries to get Sam Carter to land The Helicopter 1 guy transforms into a creature in some turely awful CGI. The Helicopter crashes & we think Sam & The Helicopter piolet are dead. Kate tells everybody that they can't leave & that The Thing is coping it's vicims like I didn't already know that from The 82 movie. So then you have this 1 girl taking to Kate & then you get another horrid CGI transformation. That creature is burned. Then Sam & The Helicopter Piolet come back. They decided to do a blood test I already knew that going to the lab is torched. Cause Kate looks at there teeth to find out that there not human open your mouth. You find out that none of these people are infected & you know not everybody has teeth fillings by this movies logic if you don't have teeth filling you'refv c k e d. Sam & The Helicopter Piollet escaped they all run into them The Helicopter Piolet shoots this 1 guys Flamethrower Tank it blows up. They take this guy who is hurt to The REC room just like The 82 movie & we get some s h i t CGI transformation you have the low Flamethrower Fuel scene recreated The Windows death scene copied from The 82 film. The Thing kills The Helicopter Piolet gut it crawls up to a wounded Adam & rubs it's face up to his & never in a million years would I have thought that the body they found in The 82 mvoie woudl be part of the dip s h it from Dumb & Dumberer & NCIS LA. You have Dr Halverson escap cause he is infected they follow him which leads to a medioce fanale with Kate & The Thing. She throws a grenade in it's mouth & it dies. If the space ship worked all along why WHY oh why did it just go there The Thing is suppose to be Stealthy & don't tell me that oh this thing is brand new it's learning. In The Documentary Carpetnter says that it's been around for 1,000 of years theres no fan fiction allowed in this dojo. Anyway Kate tells Sam you know who I knew you were human your ear ring she burns him & WOW! The Final Girl I haven't seen that before in except for 50 other fv c k in g horror movies. That Sam guy mentioned that we need to get to The Russian Outpost they never mentioned that in The 82 film & in thiis film they never mentioned The American Outpost. Then OMG this Helicopter lands at The Norwegian Base then all of a sudden a dog pops out of it there was only 1 dog & it was killed so where did it come from so they chased it down the ending of that was the start of the 82 film & if I didn't rent this I would've broken the disc & I got it with a gift card thankfully. This movie is a disgrace it is an insault to John Carpetnter it's an insautl to me being a massive fan of the 1982 film I even liked the original The Thibg From Another World so I know that The Thing was a remake but you know what it became it's own movei not a carbon copy. A movie I'll mention Levithatn it gets s h i t on people complain that it is a ripoff of Alien & The Thing I'm sorry it had characters that you cared about Peter Weller Richard Crenna, Ernie Hudson, Amanda Pays, Lisa Eilbacher & Daniel Stern. It had an inferction plot but it was underwater & did enough where it became it's own movie. Levithan didn't haves # ! t effects that looked like video game graphichs. The writer even said pratical effects will be used whenever possible wtf ever the only time I saw pratical was on the autopsy table maybe. I'm hard on CGI most of the time cause pratical effects look better effects from an almost 30 year old movie look better than anything today. It's sad that old school pratical effects are being phased out in favor of CGI. CGI was never ment to replace old school pratical effects it was to be used to do the impsooible like in T2 & The Abyss.CGI will never ever ever ever ever top pratical effects by the masters like Rob Bottin, Rick Baker, K&B John Carl Bechler & The Late Stan Winston. & please don't tell me that CGI is better cause you will just get c us se d out. The characters are forgetable Kate Lloyd is just another final girl. Joel Edgerton doesn't do much he's barley in the movie & he has 2nd billing. Eric Christen Olsen is a wimp. Urlich Thompsen is nothing special. Why was this movie made we didn't need to know what happend to The Norwegian's we know enogh that someF U B AR I N G went on. So if you want to know what happend to The Norwegian's just watch the 1st 15 or 20 minutes of John Carpenters The Thing. Don't tell me that it's a story that needed to be told a story that needed to be told was a sequel with John Carpenter coming back to direct with Kurt Russell returning. I mean think of the possibilities of The Thing in a city or The Thing in a deset or The Thing in a jungle. So this was a cash iin with 1 note characters video game graphic effects & a plot I don't care about. I remember MacReady, Windows, Norris, Dr Blair, Childs, Nauls, Gerry & Palmer why cause I cared about them. I remember The Dog transformation scene Infermary Scene The Norris transformation scene I remeber a lot of scenes. This doesn't stand on it's own legs it's just a rehash bottom line.

B005K17RU0|3.0|I have the kindle fire and at first, this app would lock it up. so I uninstalled it. Then I would reinstall it to look at the radar. After several reinstalls, it has worked really well. Therefore the 3 stars.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I wasn't able to make it to the theater to see this one, but after reading the book I knew I would have to get it somehow even on my budget. Can we say gift card for Christmas!  Worth every penny. Just as good as the book just live and in your face!
B004NELBPC|2.0|I want to like this app, but it just doesn't work well. Problems with orientation and the slideshow feature still fails frequently (but it's not entourage, so that's a plus).  It just gets frustrating that HuffPo posts so many slideshows, then delivers an app that cant display them. The last update fixed some things, introduced new bugs, and inserted more ads. Perhaps HuffPo could focus resources on delivering a solid app first, then try to monetize it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I absolutely loved it. It felt like I personally met Mr. Jobs. Really insightful, engaging and full of motivational incidents.  Highly recommended...
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This is by far the nicest cover I have seen.  It is so classy and stylish!  I get compliments all the time on the beauty of this cover.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is fun and easy to use, its fun to try and unlock all the games. Its only hard to figure out some games if you don't read directions, strange I know.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun games to waste time. unlocking games keeps it interesting and fun. there is also a limit on the high score to complete the game to set a goal.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am simply amazed at the sheer number of translations available. For a free app, it is amazingly versitile. The only down side is that you need access to wick to use.
B0073PZIYI|2.0|I'm a sucker for a good sci- fi / action movie. I'm rather forgiving in just how much I will overlook in the name of quality entertainment.<br /><br />First, the Good: Some of the acting (Cillian Murphy, Justin Timberlake and a few others) are respectably solid. Also, the overall concept is very intriguing... the world currency is time, and when a person turns 25 their \\"life clock\\" actually begins. From the time you are 25, life's objective is to keep your life clock from expiring. If it expires, you die. Not a problem for the rich, who have more time than they know what to do with: a \\"wealthy\\" person may have centuries to live, while the \\"poor\\" continuously struggle for more time. It's a very interesting premise that becomes more interesting when a poor worker (Justin Timberlake) saves a \\"wealthy\\" man from a time stealing mob boss while flaunting his wealth in the ghetto. in return, he gives Justine Timberlake all of his time (over 100 years). In a short but very philosophical discussion the wealthy man, who has mentally lived too long, says \\"We are meant to die.\\"<br /><br />So begins a science fiction tale that promises to serve up plenty of symbolism, philosophical overtones about economy and the meaning of existence. Could it possibly be the rare sci fi / action film panned by critics but destined to become a cult classic somewhere down the road?<br /><br />Hell no.<br /><br />Unfortunately, that's about as good as the film gets.<br /><br />Actually, the movie starts to go down hill and remains spiraling out of control with the entrance of Amanda Seyfried. Sadly, the story abandons all of its earlier adult-oriented promise to become a vapid \\"love story\\" seemingly aimed at a much younger audience. I was not impressed with Seyfried in \\"Red Riding Hood\\" and even less impressed with her here. This suprises me, because normally I think she's a good actress. In this movie, she serves well as eye candy, but her acting in this movie was cardboard flat awful. However, inher defense, the characters aren't scripted very well and she really wasn't given much to work with.<br /><br />For example: she plays a wealthy girl who is kidnapped by Justin Timberlake and taken to the ghetto. They are both rendered unconscious and robbed of nearly all their time. Now they have to stay on the move and struggle to stay alive without running out of time. Excellent premise! However, never once does she seem very concerned that she is mere minutes from certain death. She acts incredibly hum-drum for a rich girl who always had an over-abundance of time and now, for the first time in her life (presumably) literally has almost none. The sense of non-urgency really detracted from what could have - and SHOULD have been an incredibly suspenseful segment of the film. Just another example of weak script, weak acting and weak directing all coming together.<br /><br />The third act gets even worse when the two lovers turn into Robin Hood-esque characters, stealing from the wealthy and giving to the poor. The movie becomes so trite that anything once redeeming is no longer a part of the equation. Not that I have a problem with the class warfare message behind the film: I agree with a lot of it. I just felt the execution of that message fell flat.<br /><br />Also, the 'ghetto' was way too tame: in a world where time can be exchanged simply by grabbing someones arm, think how chaotic, dismal and brutal the ghetto would really be with people killing eachother just to survive a few more minutes. The movie becomes its own worst enemy by completely santizing what it's attempting to condemn in the first place. I understand they didn't want to cross over into R- rated territory, but the ghetto should have been much more chaotic and gritty- even at PG-13.<br /><br />All in all, this movie is so incredibly disappointing because it started with so much promise and then took all that promise and wasted it. Some the actors were solid- I've always been impressed with Cillian Murphy and I must admit that Timberlake easily holds his own as well (except for the god-awful scene when his \\"mother\\" is killed, which was cringe-worthy bad).<br /><br />With a tighter script and direction, more concentration on story and suspense as opposed to a vapid love story between the stereotypically over-indulged rich girl and the poor boy from the opposite side of the tracks- this could have been so much better than it actually was.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun game, however if they were unlocked after every passed game, it would be sooo much better. First couple games are easy, then the increase in difficulty.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|The Star Wars Trilogy on DVD is excellent.  We are so glad we purchased the set.  My husband and I watched the movies with our kids over a period of 2 weeks.  Was so great to experience it through their eyes seeing it for the first time.  The DVDs were in perfect shape.  Would buy from this seller again.
B000ROALCG|5.0|I cannot thank you enough for the opportunity to find a CD that I thought had been lost to me!!! I had watched the El Cantante Movie and absolutely fell in love with the music. I went to the local music stores to see if I could find the soundtrack and I did. Through some strange error, my CD came up missing. I searched the stores again, but they did not have the CD in stock, and wanted too high of price for it and additional cost to special order it! I have had such great success on Amazon. com before, I gave them a try; I found my once lost CD, and at a most fantastic price for a brand new CD!!!  Thank you, thank you!! I am now back to singing and dancing my salsa steps around the house!!

0385333846|5.0|Slaughterhouse Five is a book that defies a clear and coherent summary, it is hard to pin it on any one thing. On one level it is a book about the fire bombing of Dresden during the climax of the second world war - which the author witnessed first hand during his military service - but on a much larger level it is a twisted science fiction/psychological cross breed about time travel, aliens, philosophy, war, perspective, life and of course death. So it goes. The book easily scores a 5 out of 5 for it's unique writing style, story and approach: it is very readable, and though it's short, it leaves a long lasting impression. I would also say it's a book you could read twice - which is always a good thing - as there is a lot of depth scattered throughout its pages for the readers who like to highlight, take notes and dwell on the book's themes and messages.  Kurt Vonnegut employs a very economical writing style, and relies heavily on symbolism, colours and motifs, but delivers them with short and direct sentences. The author has popularised the saying `So it goes' through Slaughterhouse Five's layers upon layers of (well executed) repetition; these three words hold a certain power in the context of the story, and will no doubt conjure in the reader's mind a fascinating philosophy that underlines the whole book.  The story centers around a time traveling man called Billy Pilgrim who served in the Second World War, witnessed the fire bombing at Dresden, and was abducted by aliens who helped him to understand his time traveling experiences. He also ends up at some point in the novel as a POW in a slaughterhouse - numbered 5, obviously. These are all minor details that I will not expand upon, as you will have to read it for yourself, but rest easy in the comforting knowledge that I am not spoiling the book for you. The story is not written in chronological order and allows you to glimpse at all these occurrences and more very early on in the book. The author, even tells the reader how the book will end at the very beginning.  And so on.  All in all I thoroughly enjoyed reading Slaughterhouse Five. I strongly recommend it to anyone who has not read it before and I will always hold a special place for it in my bookshelf. :)
B006ZS81GG|5.0|omg!!! i heard this on spotify and she had me hooked from the word go!! there is something dark and seductive about Lana's music that just gets in your head and messes with you in such a great way. it's like she's performing jedi mind tricks through my speakers. i just randomly clicked on this to listen but i am so glad i did. don't sleep on this people!!!

Love everything about this movie.  I have showed it to many friends who are not fans of opera and each and every one liked the movie.
B0009IW9DE|5.0|I am very partial to this CD, I think from start to finish it's the best CD John Mellencamp has recorded to date.  I didn't care that much for the added track at the end, I didn't think it added anything at all to the other songs.  This is a great example of pure music by a grass-roots artist like John Mellencamp is.  Not much if any additional instrumentation or background music was added, it sounds like the group simply went to a practice or recording location, plugged in, turned on the recording machine, and let go.  This is not only some of the best lyrics he has ever penned, the basic instrumentation fits it to a \\"T.\\"  I always eagerly await any new release and buy them, but my two favorites are Scarecrow, and this one.  The added depth of the music and clarity of the vocals are really nice.  If you like John, and don't have this remastered copy, get it.  Totally worthy of the 5 stars I gave it.
B00000JLWW|3.0|After watching the movie on HBO after a couple of years not seeing it, I decided to purchase the DVD.  To my horror, the price suddenly jumped to $108?  I don't know if it's a misprint, or vendors suddenly jacking up the price because the DVD is no longer in print, but I find it ridiculous.
B0050KDDSQ|4.0|I have to admit, when I first started buying SACD music, Love Over Gold was at or near the top of my list of CD's to buy.  When I first tried to put my order in, it was out of stock.  So I patiently waited and then couldn't strike the keys quick enough to get a copy once it was back in stock.  I put the CD on and sat back, waiting to be \\"overwhelmed\\" starting at track #1 like on the regular CD.  Much to my surprise, I had to keep turning my receiver up to get it to a level of loudness I wanted (but I'm sure my neighbors didn't).  This puzzled me, as other SACD's I've purchased have indeed been much louder than the regular CD recording.  I really couldn't tell much difference except on occasion when the drums pounded in.  Since I'm relatively new at buying SACD music, I have read on other reviews that all digital recordings are not as full as analog recordings are and I have witnessed that.  That was another reason the sound wasn't as loud as I wanted.  This was not recorded digitally.  I also know that DTS recordings are indeed loud and some carry a warning that turning up your receiver or amp can damage your speakers--but I wanted it to do some damange!  Anyway, I still rate this at 4 starts simply because I really like the recording from start to finish and always have since it's release.  The placement of the instruments is great; you can hear them clearly and it seems like you are sitting right up front, at center stage, as the first noted are played.  I'm thrilled to have this on SACD as it appears to sell out rather quickly.  I hope the next time I put it on the CD player that it does overwhelm me as I hoped it would the first time.  Buy this, you won't be disappointed.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|Since I tend to be a 'tool guy' that likes to know what's going on around me this thing has become part of that 'right arm' thing.  Bothered by signal loss and such that seemed to become far worse around Christmas morning?  One display provided by this app can let you know part of why that might be happening; the scan of and display of the wifi channels it sees within range of your device.  You may find, as I did, that your neighbors added a bunch of wireless routers and guess what?  They're all on channel one (1)!  Even out in the woods where I live this can spell trouble.  At the very least you're likely to find that all of them seen within range of home are jammed in the first three or four channels (of the 14 available in the lower frequency band of 2.4GHZ and NONE are on the 5GHZ band).  Putting your own router up on one of those unused channels could be a simple way of avoiding interference and dropouts, etc.  A useful tool to have around on any handheld device for sure.

B0042YHC38|1.0|I bought this at Target, not through Amazon... but it's the same thing.  I'm a big guy... this doesn't fit my arm. If you're a gym rat with big arms/biceps, it probably won't fit you either. If you're a petite marathon runner, you might be ok. With my iPhone 4 in there, the top flap won't close all the way. The \\"velcro\\" feels cheap and won't hold completely... even when I tried it on my forearm, where it fits fine. The plastic screen window glares, so you can't see through it completely in the daylight... let alone that the material covers the day/night sensor, making the phone \\"think\\" it's night... the screen dims, and you can't see it anyway. Forget about using the key holder too... one key will fit in... one key. And because the band fits me so tightly, the key jabs my arm through the material. All in all, it's completely awful... complete waste of $30.
B003B8QS6S|5.0|Very good book. Historic. i enjoyed the book. it was great. I believe everyone should own and purchase this book. It is a treasure.

B006WQLH7G|5.0|I downloaded this for my android phone (LG Optimus) and it works GREAT - it even warned me about my phone being rooted :) (the alerts are ignorable should it warn you about a \\"known issue\\" such as being rooted)  I use it on my PC's as well and it provides really good, lightweight protection.  My machines are running way faster than they were with AVG or Symantec.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is great for taking notes on the go from nearly any device and/or on the go.  I use it all the time to remember how I set things up at work so I can duplicate it exactly later on if need be.  I use evernote on my iPad, iPhone (work), my android phone (personal), macbook pro, kindle fire, and a thinkpad.  If I had to manage my notes between all of those devices myself, I'd lose my mind and probably some of my notes as well.
B00479SVBU|5.0|Had looked long and far for this little guy.  Sold my truck with a satellite<br />radio with USB input and the new truck just had an \\"aux in\\".

0385534639|1.0|Everyone is this book is amazed, mesmerized, and delighted.  I wish I could join them in their amazement.  We are never amazed or mezmerized.  We are only ploddingly dragged at great length through what is supposed to be a visual masterpiece.  \\"Each element of the circus blends together in a wonderful coalescence.  Acts that have been training in separate countries on separate continents now perform in adjacent tents, each part melding seamlessly into a whole.  Each costume, each sign on each tent is more perfect than the last\\".  Come on people, this is AS GOOD AS IT GETS!  There is some kind of mass hypnosis going on in the rating of this book.  I felt like I was reading the tax code.  The author relentlessly describes things by telling us how indescribably amazing they are...without describing anything.  The characters have no emotions.  Their circumstances are interesting and yet they don't even inhabit their lives, they just move about woodenly.  It's amazing all right...amazingly bad.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the best free game ever. lots to do and you can eventually unlock all the content without paying a dime. cant beat that!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a good game with many fun minigames that help pass the time. The ads can be easily skipped and it's not difficult to earn points. It's a good game overall.

I appreciate his sharing of his experience and hope to apply this in my life.

B005KMX866|4.0|A terrific album. Isaak weaves his way thru nearly two dozen Sun Records classics, plus throws in a couple penned by his own hand. The recordings are gorgeous and it is apparent the band had much fun putting this collection together. Highlights include a spot-on Elvis cover and the first rendition of My Happiness I've heard done by a male voice. The liner notes with this album are some of the most informative and enjoyable I have come across. (My friend Roger says you should always read the liner notes.) I give it 4 stars and not 5 because of the tacky presentation of purchasing either one CD or two. All 25 songs in the 2 CD set could have been packaged onto one disc. Yet, you pay the price equivalent of a double-disc set. Jeers for that decision. Otherwise, if you like Isaak or the old Sun Records singles, you should love this CD.

B005N95JA4|5.0|I won't comment on the initial disc of Some Girls. If you don't know what it is you have stumbled onto the wrong page of Amazon. Disc 2 - bonus disc - is excellent. There is not a weak spot among the 12 tunes. The band sounds tight and full of energy. Keith presents some more of his patented cutting Stone's riffs. And Mick is at his snarling, strutting, sneering best. This could easily have been released as a Stones album by itself. Which presents a query...how much more unreleased Stone's gems like this are still out there? Hey guys, I ain't gettin' any younger and I want to hear a LOT more. Please make it available.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|The Matrix is a 2000 Science fiction film directed by the Wachowski Brothers. At the time the computer graphics were top of the line and now 12 years later they are still quite impressive. The story line is well-developed and like Blade Runner it does bring up questions regarding morals and values. Reeves is surprisingly good in the role of Neo. The music is uneven and sometimes great and sometimes just loud. Still a ground breaking film that was ahead of its time. A very intriguing and thought worthy film that should be seen by science fictions fans and good film fans alike. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|If you've ever played Fallout and wondered more about life in the vault than the wasteland, this is the book for you. Howey creates a incredibly detailed world with characters you care about, and he's brave enough to keep killing them off no matter how much you love them.

B000TVBIYC|5.0|If you're going to have a Lego Duplo train setup, you've gotta have switch points!  They allow your track to split off into different branches, etc.  And, if you have battery-operated engines by Lego Duplo, they can maneuver through the switch point in either direction, with the wheels pushing the red lever as necessary to pass by - no human switching necessary.  Great design and works well.  But, they can be pricey!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Best when using the winning deal option. A little difficult to see the first card when you have a long run on the board!
B00097E4A6|5.0|This is an excellent Lego Duplo addition to any Duplo train lover.  It is designed to work with all the battery operated train sets (or push sets as well) and is an essential component to making wonderful train setups.  Not only can it be a simple bridge as pictured on the box, it can be split in half to make elevated train sets.  If you look for \\"Duplo Intelligent Train\\" on YouTube, you will see videos of the many ways this bridge can be used.
030788743X|2.0|When it comes to reading there are 2 general classes of people, excluding those who don't read at all. And they are those who read all the time, and those who pick up a novel on a rare occasion that might be something by John Grisham, called \\"Twilight\\" or be by Dan Brown.  Unfortunately Ready Player One is the hip sci-fi novel for people of the second class. If you've read a novel called Snow Crash you've already read a book with most of this novels ideas, and a lot more, and that is far more complex, original, and almost paradoxically just plain more badass than Ready Player One at the appropriate times.  More specifically, all you get from Ready Player One is an unoriginal feeling dystopia, a copy of the game first invented in Snow Crash and then copied in the real world and named Second Life, some utterly predictable light sci fi stuff, and the feeling that you're somehow reading a cheesy 80's flick.  The tropes are familiar, the pace is slow; and for most people that have spent even a decent amount of time in an online social interaction that's open to anyone you'll find a lot of annoyingly familiar banter. Just because the stupid online arguments the characters have feel authentic, doesn't mean I actually want to read several pages of the stuff.  This is, in short, Dan Brown's copy of Umberto Eco. Or rather, while Steven King himself might be called fairly prosaic at time, Dean Koontz is still often compared as the inferior copy. So a good comparison might be \\"Ready Player One is the Dean Koontz of hip cyberpunk novels.\\" The inferior, easier to read an understand copy.  If you've arrived at this review, and you are in the latter category, by all means buy it. I've no doubt you may well enjoy it, and I certainly hope you do. But this is more a warning for those who do read a lot. Go read Snow Crash and/or Neuromancer instead, if you haven't already. Those have more character, more ideas, more interesting writing, and more to say than this cotton candy romp. I didn't even enjoy it as a guilty pleasure, something which I can and occasionally do.

0061969656|3.0|I read my first Cornwell book in 1995 and have read 35 more since then. When this series began, I enjoyed it because I didn't know much about the period of Alfred the Great. But to be honest, I'm tired of the series now and wish that Cornwell would wrap it up. One of the biggest problems is that there are dozens and dozens of people and place names in 9th-century style which start to blur with each other after a while. Cornwell must realize the problem, because he spends a lot of time trying to remind us about events from previous books, but that just adds to the tedium. I almost gave up after the first 100 pages. After that, the pace picked up a bit but it's basically the same formula over and over again, each segment ending with a jolly good smash-up.  Two of my personal pet peeves are: 1) Uhtred's unending need to express his contempt for the Christian faith of his compatriots. Honestly, Bernard, WE GET IT. I wonder if the author would be so bold if he were writing a Crusades series and talking about Islam. I doubt it.  2) Cornwell's annoying habit, developed during the Sharpe series, of ending virtually every chapter (and sub-chapter) with a tiny sentence fragment that would seem more at home in a comic book or a boy's adventure story. If you don't believe me, keep track as you read.  So in summary, this is an OK book if you enjoy Cornwell's blood-and-guts approach to history (and I usually do). But it's not so much a page-turner as a page-dragger.
B005T87QCI|3.0|Well first off I'm on a kindle fire. The game loads fine and has far better graphics than I expected. The first annoying thing is you have to download 60mb more when first started. Secondly there is a service it wants to start to share scores and friends and stuff and it got so bad I just enabled it. Overall the game plays well but does get a little sluggish at times but only briefly. The controls were easy and pretty straightforward. All in all a good buy for a buck.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoy the simplicity of these games and the fact that they are FREE! none of the games are long lasting, so the ability to play multiple in one sitting is not mundane.

0812973992|3.0|While this book is brilliantly written, it delves deeply into the darkest side of life which you know exists but if dwelled on too long would make you want to slip your wrists at the sheer despair and hopelessness of it all.
0307474259|5.0|This is an amazing book. If you're going to buy one or more diet books, or are thinking about jumping on some diet program, or just want to discuss dieting with your doctor -- read this book first.  This is not a diet book. It's a fascinating, in-depth look at the history, trends, misinformation, and bad science that surround the most common assumptions about \\"good nutrition.\\"  Equally important, Taubes clearly explains the how and why of what happens when we eat certain things (especially refined carbohydrates and sugar), particularly in regard to insulin production and the role of fat cells, and how putting certain kinds of food in your mouth leads to weight gain.  That said, this can probably serve quite well as your first and last diet book.  Taubes mentions, but does not explicitly endorse, a couple of the more popular diet books that more or less reflect the conclusions he discusses in the book. However, Taubes ends his book with some general dietary \\"guidance\\" that was created at Duke University Medical Center's nutritional clinic. This appendix takes up about 5 pages of a 235-page book. You could write the entire thing on a sheet of 8.5x11\\" paper and tape it to the fridge.  There are no special powders or shakes or calorie counting, and none of the \\"Key To Weight Loss Success! Act Today To Save On A Year's Supply!\\" nonsense.  You don't have to buy anything that cannot be obtained at your local supermarket.  I've been following the guidelines for a while. I'm never hungry except when I get really busy and forget to eat.  I'm eating delicious meals, and I have plenty of energy. And I'm steadily losing between 1 and 2 pounds a week (the lower end is always the result of reverting to bad habits, like an occasional beer-and-pizza dinner).  A little further down the road I'll get my \\"metabolic\\" markers like cholesterol checked. I'm quite confident that they'll all be improved.
B004EPZ0AM|1.0|I went to see this movie awhile back and it was the worst $10 I ever spent. While I felt the acting was good, the rest of the film was pure trash. Do yourself a favor and do not buy this film and subject yourself to this garbage.

B005L38QK2|2.0|My Xai broke after 2 years of usage and I was hoping this would replace it. However, like most other Steelseries products, the mouse is NOT durable and already begins to degrade in performance within a week or two of use. The mouse is spectacular in design, feel, and has much potential to become a great mouse. I also take great care of my mice and I do not abuse them. If one were to look at my Xai, one would not suspect that it was broken because there are no scratches on the bottom or top. I play only on my Steelseries QCK+ and I wash my hands before touching my mice ALWAYS (in addition I never eat at my desk).  It's not that Steelseries makes bad products, they just don't last long. Ask anyone who has bought the Siberias. The Siberias are great headphones and the sound quality on them is great, but they just don't last long.  I went through 2 Diablo mouses. The 1st has a problem with the left click being too stiff and would get stuck down if pressed hard enough. I returned/exchanged that one immediately. The 2nd mouse started to spazz out on me at high swipe speeds after about 2 and a half weeks of use. I'm a low sensitivity/dpi gamer and I play FPS games competitively. My settings were 1000 hz and 400 dpi.  A high sensitivity player wouldn't have trouble with this mouse obviously, but low sens gamers beware. This mouse won't jitter/spazz at first, but it will in a short amount of time.  So I am now returning this mouse for a refund because this mouse is definitely \\"different from website description.\\"
0439023513|4.0|Warning: slight spoiler (I tried not to give any details.)<br /><br />While I do agree with some of the other reviewers that the ending felt rushed (hence only 4 stars), I have to disagree with those who insisted that the character of Katniss was done an injustice by being portrayed as having been broken and destroyed by the things that befall her.<br /><br />By book 3, I was pretty invested in the characters' well being, and hoped fervently that they would be all right. Their suffering was heartbreaking to read about, and the book stayed with me for days after I finished reading.<br /><br />But I still think this was the right way to end the series. This teenage girl has been through hell. Her entire life has been nothing but a struggle to survive, she has lived through loss, starvation, pain and death, and now she has lived through a full-blown war in which she is a pawn. For her to come out of all this unscathed, for us to expect her to remain just as feisty and full of the fighting spirit as she had been in the beginning, would have rang false. Generic happy endings don't happen after war. People complain that Katniss lost her strength and became \\"weak\\". How many combat veterans come home exactly the same? Aren't we currently dealing with masses of young men and women coming back from Iraq and Afghanistan broken in mind and spirit, suffering from PTSD? Do you think it's because they're weak?<br /><br />I can honestly tell you that growing up in a family descended from Holocaust survivors, the war never goes away. You move on, you start a new life, and you live it the best you can - but it's never the same.

B00009YOQW|5.0|We received this toy as a birthday gift for my daughter.  This is by far my daughter's favorite toy and our favorite toy as well.  Adults and children who visit our house cannot get enough of it!  I love the sound the drum makes and the smooth construction of the drum.  My daughter at 10 months understands that the drumstick belongs with the drum and if she strikes it, it will make a sound.  If she finds the drumstick not near the drum, she will bring it to the drum to hit it.  She turns the drum around to try to find where the sound is coming from.  This toy is simple and yet provides a lot of entertainment.  I would recommend this toy and will buy it for the next birthday party we attend.
B006WPSQVC|2.0|While I definitely don't have anything against movies with a Christian theme, I thought this one lacked any real plot and the acting was definitely not worthly of an Academy Award. The movie stopped about 3/4 of the way through and to be quite honest, I really didn't care. It just kept we from watching the rest of it. It was just a very tired movie.
1416594795|5.0|Evolution is a theory and a fact, just as general relativity,  quantum physics, and M-theory are.  Even 250 years after the Copernican theory of heliocentric  cosmology dethroned the Ptolomeic theory of geocentric  cosmology there were some people denying that the sun is at  the center of the solar system; today nobody denies that  fact.  Likewise today some people deny evolution; a hundred  years from now, if not sooner, nobody will deny that fact.  As a dog holds to its bone (following evolution) so does the  self hold to blind belief for its survival (following evolution  too).  Yes, evolution is the driving force behind faith, hope,  dogma, and the two greatest discoveries of the human brain--math  and science.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Heard about her supposed SNL bomb, decided to check out her videos and songs. To my great surprise I found her songs to be really wonderful. I like her style and I have no idea what the people trashing her are upset about. Don't get influenced by groupthink, hear her songs and make up you own mind.
B0063GORYU|5.0|At first I was confused by how to.play this game but once I tried a few hands I got addicted.  Read the rules a few times and play with the least restrictive rules the first few times.  Once you get it you won't go back to traditional Solitaire!

B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game. After a few rounds, you begin to think of the other possibilities as to where you can move. But, the game is ever changing. I'm really glad I added this one to my apps. It helps to keep your mind fresh when you may have some time on your hands. Definitely worth getting!!!
B005V20JKI|5.0|It's really a pretty simple game that just has you dodging enemies while grabbing muffins.  You get to play as a whole bunch of different characters that automatically swap after you grab each muffin.  This makes the game kind of unpredictable as you never know which character you'll play with next.  It's pretty fun even though there isn't a huge amount of depth to it.  Definitely a quick time killer.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This has been great for my son. He plays with Legos all the time and finding something to contain them has been a pain.

B004WR125O|2.0|I somehow missed that fact that this wireless dongle only works with audio file ... no video. So I have to transfer my Itunes music to something Windows acceptable to be able to listen to music from my computer. Setting this thing up is no piece of cake either I had a 20 digit WPA security code with my router the software in the receiver and the dongle will only accept around 8 digits. It only took 5 calls and several hours on the phone with Onkyo to figure this out. I haven't used it with any of the online services like Pandora yet so it may have some use for me eventually. Not what I thought it was ...
B004EPZ07U|3.0|I expected this movie to be awful.  While it wasn't something fantastic, it was better than I thought it would be. Worth renting, unless you catch it on sale. The Ultraviolet digital copy is for Flixter instead of itunes, which is a pain, but we don't buy our movies for the digital versions anyways.
B0055Q5F36|4.0|I ordered the wrong one! I just got my new android on New Years Eve, I didn't know a lot about the phone, but knew I needed a \\"protective cover\\", Having heard rave reviews about Otterbox I figured I'd get one. As I was looking at the site and not knowing what the i9100 was, but it clearly said \\"Samsung Galaxy S II. My phone is a Samsung Galaxy S II! But it's a \\"T989\\". Apparently their different. Otterbox DOES NOT make one for the T Mobile Galaxy S II!!! You have been warned! Do not make the same mistake as me. Although \\"Amazon\\" was amazing in returning my money as soon as they received the case. Less than a week from when I called them till I had my money back in my account! AWESOME!
B002HFP0R4|4.0|I have most of the songs on this set, so let me explain why I bought it anyway.  1. Andy Gibbs songs are hard to get at a good price. All of the really important ones are here and are beautifully remastered. My original Andy Gibb greatests hits cd sounds poor compared to the disc in this collection.  2. Some gorgeous songs by Maurice. I had never heard \\"Walking On Air\\", Angel of Mercy\\" or \\"The Bridge\\". All 3 are pop masterpieces and worth owning. Other tunes on Maurice's disc are noteworthy as well like \\"Man In The Middle\\"  I agree wih other readers and collectors of Bee Gee music about the gaps in this box set, most notably the Barry and Robin singles that were not included...and for that I deducted 1 star.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|The whole series falls apart in this final episode. Katniss truly becomes someone you can hardly stand much less root for. The author goes for the shock value of losing everyone in war as though it is some integrity badge found in reality of war, when the books premise is a complete fantasy to begin with.  The ending makes little sense of what we watch in character development. Was this book written in two weeks??? and edited in one????  Talk about ruining one of the potentially great heroines in recent fiction. Katniss is turned into a bumbling fool and the pawn of everyone.  Extremely frustrating read in almost every chapter. I decided the author was so committed to being unexpected that she ruined the whole thing.
B000J5XS3C|5.0|Love it I use it for mic a CD Player and my laptop! Great sound quality! product is alot smaller then it looks in the picture... what I loved trhe most was the price! I wound Highly recoment this to someone!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I did read this book quickly, and it was a very engaging story. But I guess true to its genre I felt very cheated. The character development felt so rushed and the insights into why they each behaved the way they did seemed so underdeveloped.  I also never fully embrace the pretense of the book, that children placed in an arena will choose to kill each other even if they are compelled to do so.  I also find it disturbing that this type of plot is so popular. uggh, is this what entertains us today, a life and death survivor????  I am giving it three stars but only because it kept me reading, which is more than i can say for most books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I absolutely can not stop playing this!! tons of variety... I find myself not able to put my dang phone down at night. I tell myself just one more.... repeatedly!  lol
B003O86FMW|2.0|As the first book, I was left feeling cheated on character development. I thought the plot for book two was too much of a repeat of the first book.<br /><br />I also think Katniss goes from being a heroine to a foolish child in this book. yes she is a teenager but the author chooses in this book to diminish her stature significantly.<br /><br />I am not recommending this book, if you read book one, then this is merely a rinse and repeat.

0767802470|3.0|I bought the Director's Cut DVD and there's a problem....if you choose subtitles or English, whatever you choose doesn't carry through to the 2nd side.  Once there you have no choice and no matter what you picked on the first side (the beginning) you have no chance to choose again and so must watch the 2nd half in German...missing, unless you're fluent in German, much.  Yes, the harrowing action is still there but there are times you would like to know what they're saying!  Very disappointing.  Has anyone else had this problem?  Any hints?
B0073PZIBQ|3.0|Don't expect to get any big guffaws from watching this. The main thing I kept asking myself throughout this flick was, \\"Do people really travel back and forth across the US chasing birds? If I had the money to do that, I think I would find better thiings to spend my money on.\\" Anyway, on my scale of 1 to 10, 5 being \\"Very forgettable,\\" this is a solid 4.5.

B006SVHOL8|3.0|Since so many of my favorite actors were in this, I thought there must be more to it than the movie's title revealed. I was wrong. All I can say is either there are many great actors who are worried about a recurrence of the Great Plague, or they saw other stars signing up and said, \\"I better get in on this.\\" Worth a watch if you have time, but don't put it on the top of your list.

B000TGJ8A8|4.0|I just watched Next and while it wasn't one of my favorite films or a film of outstanding value over time; it was a typical Hollywood Thriller action picture with all the typical elements of the chased, the chaser, the love interest and another chaser who is much more ruthless than the first.  It held my attention and I liked the movie but this one will be forgotten about in a way that Blade Runner will not be.  It doesn't stand out in direction or story in any way.  It was as Hollywood bland as Paycheck at taking a Philip K. Dick idea and then throwing all the action tropes onto it to make a movie.  Other than a few exceptions the movies adapted from Philip K. Dick stories weren't crafted to retain his vision in the original work or his overall vision from entire library of writings.<br /><br />Next isn't a bad movie in of itself but as a Philip K. Dick movie I think I was not very enjoyable.  I believe for a Philip K. Dick to be successful especially in the long run, the movie needs to respect Dick's point of view and treat the film as if that point of view was being communicated to the audience, as if Philip K. Dick wrote and directed it himself.
0061969656|5.0|I am a big fan of the 9th Century.  Cornwall provides the best novel. on the subject I have ever found.  i like the fact that he explains his deviations from history in the end of the book.  His version of life in Anglo-Saxon 9th century Britain matches what I know of the History of the era.  I think it would be difficult to start by reading this book since the series is so tied together.  I look forward to the next installment.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It has been noted that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences tends to bestow its annually presented golden statuette on films about those who struggle with something, and for whom success does not come easily.<br /> On the 60th anniversary of the passing of the Great King George VI, I dedicate this review of a film about an extraordinary friendship between a hard-pressed and unexpected monarch, and a loyal subject who helped him find his voice and lead his people as well as an Empire at one of the most crucial moments in modern history.<br /> In the title role, Best Actor Colin Firth bears no real physical resemblance to the fair and slender George VI--a fact definitely not lost on the two Barbadian former subjects of the British Crown who raised me. But he accurately captures the frustration-born hostility of a man thrust into History's spotlight ill-prepared and through no wish of his own.<br /> Helena Bonham Carter plays the late Queen Mum Elizabeth, whose recollections of the film's events were things she wanted revealed only after her death because they were so painful. Bonham Carter, long overdue to receive an Oscar herself, epitomizes the  role of a loving and loyal wife, who procures the appointment for her husband with the Australian-born speech therapist and amateur actor, Lionel Logue(aptly and appropriately played by Aussie Geoffrey Rush) to help her husband, then the Duke of York with his stammering in 1934.<br /> Initially making a discreet appearance at Logue's dowdy residence, the Duchess of York introduces herself with a pseudenom, but soon reveals her husband's true identity to Logue, and while while expressing delight at meeting a member of the Royal Family, he does not become overly enthused as he answers what will be a call to greatness.<br /> The first meeting of the two men is awkward and a bit apprehensive. Logue even advises his royal client against smoking, warning that despite what his doctors say, it would kill him.<br /> As King George V, Michael Gambon pushes the Duke of York to improve his public speaking ability, knowing that the times demand that royals do more than just be silent and dignified in public, and also that the Duke's older brother, the future Edward VIII( Guy Pearce), is disgracing the monarchy with his affair with the married Wallis Simpson(Eve Best). He warns that the Duke, informally known as Bertie, must be the one who carries the family because when he is gone, his older brother \\"will destroy himself, this family, and the nation within 12 months.\\"--a bit of very accurate dialogue.<br /> Altough there will be conflict between Logue and his royal patient, Logue is compelled to step up his services as the major events that shape Bertie's life unfold.<br /> In view of their disparate backgrounds, both men have loving and supportive wives and families. The current Queen Elizabeth II  as a child is portrayed by Freya Wilson and her sister, Margaret, by Ramona Marquez--and Logue's family are portrayed by Jennifer Ehle(once again sharing screentime with Firth as she had in A&E's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" over a decade earlier)as Logue's wife, Myrtle, and Callum Gittins, Dominic Applewhite, and Ben Wimsett as his sons, Laurie, Valentine, and Anthony,who find themselves astonished by the presence of royalty. The rapport between two couples provides delightful moments, although the wives agree to maintain a barrier of formality whereas their husbands don't.<br /> Logue does psychoanalysis on the Duke, in which it is revealed that like many stammerers, he was left-handed, but forced to use his right hand (standard practice at that time), that his nanny abused and neglected him for three years,the death of his younger epileptic brother, John is mentioned, as is his father's desire that his children fear him as he feared his father--all stress factors contributing to his condition.<br /> Claire Bloom plays the prim and reserved Queen Mary, Derek Jacobi(the onetime portrayer of Roman Emperor Claudius the Stammerer) plays Archbishop Cosmo Lang, who helps Bertie deal with his brother's abdication and his own sudden thrust onto the throne.Anthony Andrews( who once played Edward VIII himself), as Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin, and Roger Parrott and Timothy Spall are his successors Neville Chamberlain and Winston Churchill.<br /> Logue's methods prove effective as he attends his royal charge at critical moments. But I find myself questioning the use of profanity in this film. It's as though there can't be an Oscar winner for Best picture without any, especially since violence doesn't figure into this story. It may be accurate given what Bertie had to deal with, however.<br /> Nevertheless, director Tom Hooper and writer David Seidler have given a terse, solemn, but elegant presentation of the life of the man who became a unique power behind the throne--sent to help  a modern Moses who lamented his slowness of speech become the man he was destined to be, and to help him lead the world at the most critical time of the 20th century.

It was different than I thought it was going to be. I honestly thought it was going to be the next chapter of the Darcy/Rachel dilemma. I am happy I purchased, I will be reading more Emily Giffin books.

B000J5XS3C|5.0|I have a audio interface that has all the inputs on the back  this was difficult so for the longest time when I had my studio setup I had a mixing board going into the interface. It is always nice to have a channel strip on the line that your capturing because it make the final adjustments fine. This board is great, no sliders which I had to clean. The board has all the same features that were on my 8 channel DOD board that I used for years and it only needs a small space on my desk. The only thing that I am not keen upon is that there is no on/off switch so the unit is unplugged most of the time. It makes the stuff I do in Logic easy. This is a home use unit  great for the price as well as for its quality.

B002ZG97LK|4.0|Did you see the 1984 original? If so, you will recall that this film launched Kevin Bacon's career. Now let's see if this sweet-spirited version (which duplicates many of the original scenes verbatim!) will do the same for our new Ren McCormack. Based on the DVD available from Amazon, I think it might.<br /><br />  * Kenny Wormald (\\"Center Stage: Turn It Up\\") is Ren, who, after his mother died, was transplanted from Boston to this podunk town out in the hinterlands of Texas, where his love of dancing hits a stone wall. Wormald is a former backup dancer for Justin Timberlake, who recommended him for this role. Good call, Justin!<br />  * Dennis Quaid (\\"Vantage Point\\") is Reverend Moore, the grieving minister who had a town ordinance passed that outlawed dancing three years ago after five teenagers were killed, including his boy.<br />  * Julianne Hough (\\"Dancing With the Stars\\") is Ariel, the minister's daughter, rebellious and in pain because her father's sole focus is on his dead son and not on his living daughter.<br />  * Andie MacDowell (\\"Groundhog Day\\") is Vi, the minister's wife. Her job is to referee the battles between her husband and their daughter and to provide another point of view when it's needed ...which is fairly often.<br />  * Ray McKinnon (\\"The Blind Side\\") surprised me as Ren's Uncle Wes, because this gawky hick turned out to be fair, supportive and wise. I'm always shocked when I have to revise my expectations of a character that are based on a few prejudices of my own.<br />  * Miles Teller is a revelation! That sad, bewildered teenager from \\"Rabbit Hole\\" is the guy Ren and his nieces teach to dance. He's funny and (eventually) he really dances in a highly entertaining montage; I always like to watch someone master a new skill.<br /><br />Of course you have the usual coterie of chums and high-school faculty, plus members of that well-meaning town council, so there are many capable actors who get to strut their stuff. The line dancing is enjoyable, but the grudge race using school buses left me cold.<br /><br />I'm glad the film starts with that horrific wreck, it's a great illustration of the hazards of drinking and driving! I appreciate the clean-shaven look of the principal players - only the bad guys are scruffy. This version, like the first, does NOT devolve into an anti-religious screed, but instead respects the convictions of the principals, e.g., Ren uses the Old Testament in his petition to the city council.<br /><br />This film is PG-13, so you'll hear a smattering of profanity and see the promise of nudity, but not the real thing. No gunshots or blowie uppie stuff, but you DO see what a reckless wench Ariel has become. Don't hate me Kevin Bacon, but given the athleticism of today's dancers, I like this one better than yours.
B005K17RU0|5.0|As mentioned above, this application works perfectly on my Kindle Fire with no tweaking whatsoever.  I used the standard download from the Kindle appstore, and any difficulties this app may have had in the past are long gone. Very accurate forecasts as well.

B000002MTU|5.0|I'll try and be brief.  If you love the blues, Eric Clapton and/or the sound of old-school electric guitar, there's no way you won't enjoy this album -- it's actually a valuable barometer of where you stand on these three topics. This is essentially Clapton's valentine to a variety of random blues tracks he's enjoyed over the years, and if you can find the video \\"Nothing But The Blues\\" and watch him perform the music contained on this disc, you'll see nothing but pure joy. These are all covers and songs you likely never heard before he amassed this collection (with the exception of Hoochie Coochie Man and It Hurts Me Too, the latter of which appeared on the Crossroads 4-disc box/collection).  In essence, this is a surprisingly loud, energetic reboot of the blues that sounds fresh because it's genuine to the tracks except played through (relatively) modern equipment -- amps, guitars, mics, etc.  If you eschew the more pop-based material in Clapton's catalog -- and there's plenty of pop to be had -- this might not be your thing. However, if you find yourself willing to be immersed in the actual blues that forged Clapton's musical soul, a lot of these songs -- and his re-telling of them here -- comprise that soul.  In short, anyone who gives this a listen will either love it or hate it -- based on the three criteria listed above -- and odds are very good that if you've made it this far into this discussion you'll be one of those that will love it.  About the only thing I can say that's remotely negative about this collection of songs is that they're loud and energetic as opposed to relaxed and quiet. So play (and where applicable jam out on air guitar) accordingly ;-)

There were few humorous parts, and nothing I found laugh out loud funny.  Whole sections were downright boring and I forced myself to skim rather than put the book down all together.  Page after page of revised SNL skits?  No thank you.  I've seen them before or changed the channel because they were lame.  I don't need to see how you insignificantly changed one littly tiny word in the skit.  I wouldn't recommend this to friends, and I wouldn't read a follow up if written.

1572816112|5.0|The Deviant Moon Tarot is one of my all-time favorite decks. Now U.S. Games has released a borderless version of the deck, making the brilliant and edgy illustrations even more powerful.<br /><br />If you've seen any of Patrick Valenza's work, you won't be surprised to learn that, as a child, he loved spending time in cemeteries. The intensely lyrical look of moonlight casting shadows at midnight, common in 1940's black and white movies, lends a tinge of something deliciously eerie to Valenza's offbeat cast of characters.<br /><br />He began drawing tarot cards at the age of nine. This deck was decades in the making and the final product demonstrates what he has learned during those years of study. Nearly grotesque, but never morbid, I wrote in a review of the original deck that it was Valenza's humor that pulled the illustrations back from the edge. My current evaluation is that it is his passion for and knowledge of the tarot wisdom that elevates the deck from \\"zombie chic\\" to transcendent 60's edgy.<br /><br />Whether in this bold version or the original format, this remains one of my symbolic and creative favorites.<br /><br />(TarotWise.com received a free copy of this deck.)

1592402690|5.0|I just finished reading this book, the first one on my new Kindle I got for Christmas. I love the kindle.    This is my 5th Beatles book. I am 50 years old and have been a lifelong Beatles fan. I am a hobby musician who has built small home studios in the past and have always been interested in the process of recording as well as the writing and performance part of music. This book was a fascinating look into the process of recording in my opinion the greatest band ever.    From the the other Beatles books that I have read this book rings true to me. I have read this book, the Beatles own \\"Anthology\\", \\"The Beatles\\" by Bob Spitz, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" by Jonathan Gould, and \\"The Beatles\\" by Allan Kozinn\\". In my opinion Spitz's book was the most comprehensive early accounting of their live's. Anthology is a must because it's straight from the source, and Kozinn's book (still my favorite) was the most comprehensive look from a musical standpoint, but Mr. Emerick's book (the luckiest man alive? Ha! :>) hold's a unique place as well. His life was a convergence of great timing and great talent, and he writes a well written well organized story here.    I have always told my kid's that a successful life has three elements, good timing, a little luck, and a lot of hard work, and that formula certainly fits the bill for Mr. Emerick when describing his life and experience's. He give's the reader an honest look from the inside. This is a must read for any Beatles fan, but most especially for any fan that is a musician or has an interest in recording and the process. Thank you Mr. Emerick for sharing your story. The only thing left is for Sir Paul to write his biography. Now THAT'S a story still left to be told!

B004498KPU|5.0|This DVD package covers Michael Jackson's entire solo career with Epic Records from 1978/79 to 2003 with the music video for \\"One More Chance\\".<br /><br />Sadly enough, Mr. Jackson's personal life seems to over shadow his musicial career. But, we must always remember, it was the music and the creative genius that made the world first love Michael Jackson.<br /><br />All of these videos look great and have even been remastered for better video and audio quality. Bear in mind, most of these were filmed on video tape (480p/480i) so really they look the best that the possibly can here. Therefore, I'm not sure why people are complaining about the video and audio quality. The bottom line is that this is the best package of Michael's short films to date. Unless this set is released on blu ray (which it eventually will) this is the best that we have now.<br /><br />The highlights for most are obvious - Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, Thriller, Bad, Remember the Time, Black Or White, Beat It and You Rock My World. My favorites though were \\"One More Chance\\", \\"Can You Feel It\\", \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" (Prison Version) and \\"Why\\" by Michael Jackson and 3T.<br /><br />Don't hesitate to buy this set. It is absolutely brilliant, and if you are a Michael Jackson fan, you won't be disappointed.

B00356CO1E|5.0|I just completed my 30day shred and am happy to report great results. I mainly got the videos for toning because I have always been a flabby skinny person. These workouts are great because of her 3-2-1 strength, cardio, and ab intervals. Even though they're only ~20mins a day, the workouts effectively sculpt your body (much more so than my previous routine of running 3miles/day). I saw I was less bloated in about a week and had ab definition by the time i was halfway through Level 2. The workouts are fun and safe. There are modifications for beginners with every exercise. I did skip some days as I also picked up yoga during this past month. Additionally, I also modified my diet a bit. I made sure to eat more protein and cut down on carbs and fats. This is a FANTASTIC month-long workout for anyone who wants a more sculpted body but doesn't have an hour to spare at the gym every day. In fact, my body looks better than when I did spend hours at the gym. J. Michaels is a great fitness trainer and knows how to really get you the most results for your workout time!  **In regards to the Amazon digital video version...It is definitely cheaper than buying the DVD and is convenient that you can stream it from any computer anywhere you travel by logging onto your amazon acct. Only caveat is that you have to make sure your wifi connection is good or it will be skippy during streaming. Only one time that I had this issue, which was when I stayed at a hotel with free but poor wifi**

0062112430|5.0|his book is incredible from the very beginning.<br /><br />Imagine a world with no love.<br /><br />For Lana, it's a reality. When children reach the age of 18, doctors cure them of the love disease. They surgically remove it from the teenagers' brains, along with everything connected - passion and desire are removed as well. Then, each is paired with another of the opposite sex and put on a set track or life, including a government approved job and a set number of children.<br /><br />Until then, children are raised with the fear of the disease. Boys and girls are educated separately and not allowed to spend time together unattended by someone cured. Love destroys people, makes them insane, and can eventually kill them. Love leads to war and suffering and pain. By keeping boys and girls separate most of the time, the risk of accidental love before their 18th birthdays is greatly lowered.<br /><br />The government monitors everything from cell phone conversations to internet searches and music. Families live in fear of the nighttime raids. On these raids, enforcers and regulators search homes and people, hoping to weed out any sympathizer. If a sympathizer is found, he often goes to jail - or is killed - without a trial.<br /><br />The book begins several months before Lena's scheduled procedure. She's scared but looking forward to the surgery because she fears love even more. She's known victims of love and witnessed their suffering and wants the procedure over and done with before she has a chance to fall victim herself.<br /><br />Then she meets Alex. Alex is wan invalid - someone from the Wilds (outside Seattle's locked and electrified gates) and never had the procedure. Though no one knows. He's one of many uncureds, mingling with the normal population.<br /><br />The more time Lena spends with Alex, the more she sees the world for what it is. The cured adults surrounding her no longer feel safe. Instead, she starts to understand that, without love and passion, there's nothing left to give life purpose. People work a job the government gave them; marry to the person the government chose for them; raise children by the rules; and have flat, meaningless interactions with friends and family. Once cured, it's rare for one to even fall into dreams at night.<br /><br />The possibility of living the strict, government approved life begins to scare Lena more than the disease.<br /><br />This book is amazing, and I preordered the next to Kindle ebooks before I finished the first chapter. I fell in love with Lena and felt like a proud parent as her strength, independence, and spirit grew.

0385534639|2.0|Before reading this book, I read a bunch of reviews, including critical reviews. So I went in knowing there'd be a lot of description and that the so-called \\"duel\\" involves creating magical circus attractions. And I thought, that's cool, I like description and don't mind a slow pace or lack of action when it's a good book.<br /><br />Well.<br /><br />Here's the thing about this book. It depends entirely on descriptions of the magical, mysterious circus. Not plot, or characters, or writing style; it depends on the reader being swept away by descriptions of the caramel-scented air, the circular paths between tents, the bonfire that never goes out.... and so on. Whole chapters do nothing but describe how magical the circus is and how much everyone loves it. So if you want to fantasize about visiting a magical circus, this is the book for you.<br /><br />This book has been so well-received that I feel a bit churlish detailing everything that it's lacking, but I'm going to do so anyway and hope I'm not the only one to have this reaction.<br /><br />The plot, about two magicians forced into a competition, doesn't really move until the second half of the book and even there it doesn't move much.<br /><br />The writing style is nothing special. I see this book called \\"literary\\" in some corners, but we must understand that word differently. A book isn't automatically literary by including lots of description, a slow-moving plot, chapters on end in which the main characters don't appear, and a few Shakespeare references (pointed out by the characters for those who wouldn't otherwise have realized they're quoting Shakespeare). Those features might often be found in literary books, but true literary books have excellent character development and writing style, while this book is no better than average in either area.<br /><br />It's full of one-sentence paragraphs, though.<br /><br />You know, for emphasis.<br /><br />Which after awhile just starts to look amateurish.<br /><br />About the characters, then. I won't say they're all bad, because they're not. I was glad to see that this is a cast of adults, men and women both. Some of them, including the protagonists, seem to have some potential, and the romance between Celia and Marco is sweet more often than it's cheesy. But beyond that, there just isn't much there. Celia and Marco are especially two-dimensional as kids--they had no interests beyond magic? no friends? they never tried to rebel? they never wanted or aspired to anything else? Marco was happy to sit in a room alone all day as an eight-year-old boy? Celia never noticed men until meeting him as an adult?--and it was hard throughout to shake the feeling that there was nothing more to these characters than what appeared on the page. But there's so little complexity to the entire cast (maybe after a decade or more, someone might get tired of the circus or start to feel trapped?). And the ramifications of many of the characters' actions aren't even dealt with (is everybody okay with being made sterile without being asked?).<br /><br />And then there's the dialogue, which is stilted and awkward. And then there's the fact that beyond the circus, there is no sense of the time period the story is set in (late 19th century) or the many locales in which it takes place. That may have been intentional; there's a mention of the circus seeming more real than the outside world. But then there's the sheer self-indulgence of it all: all the descriptions of the circus and of late-night dinners and enchanted attire and so on that overwhelm the book. Not to mention the breathlessness which with the author treats every new appearance of magic, as if readers will be astonished that--for instance--the circus closes due to inclement weather several hours before the weather turns bad, in a book where this sort of thing has happened since page two. And there's the unconvincing way magic is presented to the outside world: apparently everybody assumes it'sjust a trick, but how things like clothing turning into birds can be passed off as mundane stage-magicianship are beyond me.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for this book. That, or just not the right reader. I will go see the movie though: I imagine the marvels of the circus will be more marvelous on the screen than in Morgenstern's rather uninspired prose, and the minimal plot should fit well into a two-hour film.just a trick, but how things like clothing turning into birds can be passed off as mundane stage-magicianship are beyond me.<br /><br />Maybe I wasn't in the right mood for this book.

B006P0FICE|5.0|I must say that I loved this adaptation of the Three Musketeers, and I have seen most if not all of them.  Of course it was not true to the book, and we were sure of this going into the theater, as the preview and movie poster had air-ships on/in them.  I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the film.  It was hilarious, action packed, somewhat romantic and did I mention -  it was hilarious!  Bottom line: Is this a great period piece - no.  Is it an amazing piece of drama - no.  Is it completely true to Dumas' novel - no.  Will it win an Academy award - no.  What it was was sheer entertainment from begining to end.  I am pre-ordering it today, and highly recommend it to anyone!

Definitely the wrong year considering they are supposed to be married six years at this point. The story includes mentions of characters from Persuasion and Emma. The events of Persuasion happen around 1815, this story has them happen before 1803. If you don't mind an obviously wrong timeline it shouldn't bother you. I didn't like the way she portrayed several of the characters, Colonel Fitzwilliam in particular. The murder wasn't much a mystery. Most of the book was spent rehashing what happened in the original Pride and Prejudice. I expected much more and was very disapointed.
0805092447|5.0|We were given this book (hardcover) when my children were very small. That's more than 20 years ago. They loved it. We loved it. Somehow it got away from us over the years. Just bought the new version for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday. All these critical teachers are missing the point. Great rhythm, rhyme and colors. Who cares if the words aren't placed exactly right. Does it impair the child in some way? I think not. Great book in whatever format. I would recommend it without question.
145162445X|2.0|Admittedly, your average reader would do well to know more about cosmology. However, yet another attempt to casually explain the evolution of the universe, even if we have bits of quantumly fluctuating space to build in, is unnecessary and does little to solve the problem posed by nothing less than the title. Granted, the author does define \\"nothing\\" so that the rest of the book flows, but the book is watered down to such an extent that must have understood his \\"nothing\\" to be not the nothing his audience would be curious about.  Obviously, we'd like to know what physicists think about the probability distributions behind universal parameters, if such things even exist. Maybe the specialist has discovered mathematical necessity behind the way things are. For all the casual reader knows, electrons were recently discovered to have (little) stamps from their manufacturing plants. None of that is covered here to any reasonable extent. And it's alright if the above considerations don't yield anything useful, but there's no need to publish a book saying so.  There wouldn't be anything prohibitively wrong with the book, though, if he'd stuck to his interpretation of the question. There are some disturbingly self-serving who-theorized-what-whens, some obvious beef towards string theorists (which even when qualified still sounds personal), and not a few unnecessary mentions of religion. I was distressed to read a refutation of Dinesh D'Souza, as if he were germane - when I saw Dawkins' afterword, everything made sense.  This should not be treated as a general introduction to the questions and results. This is part of an ongoing dialogue among some thinkers who feel very strongly about their models. Nothing wrong with that, but general readers shouldn't begin here, and once they've begun elsewhere, I don't know what use this text will be to them.  The casual reader will, I believe, gain a little from the description of quantum gravity and chaotic expansion. The illustrationsthe author uses were enlightening.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|fun game, makes you use your mind. leaves you wanting more. the graphics and sounds are entertaining. one of my favorite apps.
B005Z271Y6|5.0|This DVD is fantatsic, Adele is one of the greatest singer/songwriters of our time and the love and admirartion from her fans is phenominal as you can witness from this DVD. If anyone likes great music with such an incredible voice as Adeles then this is for you, I know I intend to wear mine out, never get tired of watching and listeneing to her.  HIGHLY recommend it.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|I normally do not buy movies however, this one belongs in everyone's collection. Humphrey Bogart did his best acting in this movie, IMHO, of course.
B005JU5JEI|4.0|Don't watch this movie for the plot or for character depth.  It's humorous if you keep in mind that it's only a movie and nobody would ever cross so many lines and still have a job.  I'm a teacher too and sometimes I mess up a lecture because I talk a little fast.  Well it makes me feel better to know that at least I would never consider doing any of the things done is this movie...don't take it too seriously.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|Purchased Love Never Dies on Blu-Ray today!  Couldn't wait to get home to watch it.  I saw the production in Melbourne the week before it was filmed and was awe-struck - it was amazing.  Now, having watched it on Blu-Ray it was great - not fantastic, but great.  The editing is a little too sharp in some places, but I think that was to keep the pace going.  Ben Lewis makes an excellent Phantom and Anna O'Byrne is a wonderful Christine.  The other actors are very good and the Gustave who is in this release was much better then the one I saw live.  I really enjoyed this movie and seeing it in 2:35:1 was a thrill.  Can't believe that it is not being released around the world to much later than it's release in Australia.  Fans of TPotO should really like this production, it has wonderful songs and melodies and really can stand by itself.  Well worth the purchase on Blu-Ray.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Love this game! Fun finding the hidden objects &amp; trying to solve the mystery. The story line keeps you guessing.  This is an easy game, but a good time passer.
B000LC4CVA|4.0|The setting (Slane Castle) was impressive and added great atmosphere to the performance.  The members of Celtic Woman have varied and beautiful voices, and the pieces they sang demonstrated their skills, singly and as a group.  I have loved the fiddler since I watched her with Michael Flatley's troup. Her skill is fantastic, and she looks like she is having the best time!  The beautiful and colorful costumes and gowns, the talented instrumentalists, plus the ancient background make this a memorable and enjoyable treat for ears and eyes.  The only things I found lacking were: more enthusiasm and participation from the audience,(or perhaps I am just used to American audience response, and found the Irish more subdued in contrast); and a bit of Irish step-dancing would have rounded out the show!  Anyway, a great, entertaining DVD.
B005974CDU|4.0|Well, despite the hype, Portnoy leaving the band hasn't seemed to change much.  (Mind you, there is a history of bands following up an important band member's departure with a fine album, just to show they can, only to change their style on the next album - e.g. Metallica and Genesis).  If I found the previous two Dream Theater albums to be somewhat \\"safe/traditional\\" releases for their career (as opposed to Octavarium, 6 Degrees, etc. where they seemed to be trying to expand their sound), this one seems to be even more of a focused attempt to return to past territory.  The opening song is very reminiscent of \\"Images & Words\\", while \\"Build Me Up, Break Me Down\\" kind of reminds me of the \\"Falling to Infinity\\" era.  However, they're not totally rehashing previous ideas - I don't find this album redundant or uninspired, and there's lots of great music/musicianship and inspired moments.    The new drummer does a fine job, but is definitely non-obtrusive - the drums are pretty low in the mix.  He's obviously a skilled musician, so maybe he'll get to stand out more as he settles into the band.    Overall, I've found this album to be quite enjoyable and quite relistenable.  If you like Dream Theater and are nostalgiac for their classic albums, this is a good buy.  However, if you're the kind of person that wants to hear a band constantly pushing/experimenting with thier sound, this will probably not impress you.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|The Bee Gees CD greatest hits is great and brings back memories. I received the CD's by the scheduled ship date.
B0026J8LHM|4.0|If you're a fan of Dream Theater, this album is pretty much \\"more of the same\\".  Not that they're totally repeating themselves, but they're not straying from their classic sound or experimenting like on Six Degrees or Octavarium.<br />  My biggest complaint here is that they do some things where the musical style doesn't really work with the lyrics.  For instance, the opening track \\"A Nightmare To Remember\\" is about someone in a car crash, and the band uses modern \\"harsh\\" vocal styles in a few instances that might work in a song about beating people up, but don't really make sense in a \\"thank God nobody was killed\\" kind of context! Also, the epic closing song \\"Count of Tuscany\\" is going for a thriller-type atmosphere (not the Michael Jackson \\"Thriller\\", but the genre), but the lyrics don't really convey any kind of serious threat, so it's kind of weird.  Musically, however, both songs are the kind of great, sophisticated, rocking music that I love about Dream Theater.  The only weak song is \\"Wither\\", a generic and mediocre pop/ballad that is, of course, the single the band put out, so anyone unfamiliar with them can hear it and have no idea what the band is really all about.  (But then, I kind of thought the ballads on \\"Images & Words\\" weren't that good, either).<br />  I got this one-disc version and downloaded (legally - I paid for them like an honest person) the cover tracks.  As far as they go, the band deserves high regard for their quality taste in choosing brilliant and non-mainstream songs to cover.  However, I don't find myself overly into the actual covers on this disc.  I think the thing is, what I like most about Dream Theater is their songwriting.  For the covers I'm familiar with, they pretty much play them straight, but with their own sound.  However, Iron Maiden in 1983 and Dio-era Rainbow had a brilliant sound and fantastic singers, that make it nearly impossible to do a cover of without sounding inferior (unless the cover is very different).  So, unless you're unfamiliar with the originals, or just really a big fan of Dream Theater's sound (and vocals), I would say the one disc version is fine.<br />  The 3-disc special edition also has an \\"instrumental\\" version of the songs, but I've realized over time that I really don't need variants of the same songs, especially instrumental versions of vocal songs (which just seem to be missing something), although I haven't heard this particular disc, so I can't critique it specifically.<br />  All-in-all, a fine, if somewhat flawed and somewhat safe, album by Dream Theater, which I still quite enjoy after many repeated listenings and several years.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Northanger Abbey is interesting. I am glad to add it to my collection. It is not at the top of my list of DVD's but it was good. I was pleased with the seller and it was shipped on time.

B0068RHSZO|4.0|This Movie Dream House was cool, but it was confusing, someone else mentioned to me that it was confusing too, I have to agree with that, it was sort of hard to follow and put together as to what was happening, I'm definetly gnna watch it again, to see if that helps me understand it better, if it's possible and in your budget, try to rent it first, before buying to make sure you actually like it.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|\\"Limitless\\" reveals to us what can happen when we achieve our full potential. In the case of the movie's protagonist, he uses an experimental drug to achieve the results. We get a glimpse of all that's possible when his mind starts to function at full capacity. However, we also get to see the negative side effects of relying on chemical enhancement. The negative side effects are the primary drivers of the drama in this movie, as well as the attempt to mitigate those effects. This establishes the crux of the whole movie: Who succeeds in the end, the man who takes the drug, or the drug itself?
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've been addicted to this game since I got my Kindle Fire.  The only weird thing is that to get a winning deal you have to be connected to Wifi.
B00004YA66|5.0|\\"Frequency\\" is a movie that explores the possibility of changing the past. It does this through a ham radio set and an intense Coronal Mass Ejection, which leads to intense Auroras. This phenomenon allows a police officer, portrayed by Jim Caviezel, to communicate with his deceased father, portrayed by Dennis Quaid. The Auroras allow them to reach across a 30 year span of time. With this much hindsight, the father and son work to change the past and create a much better future for themselves.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Its so fun I finished this game in one day!!!  I wish it was longer though but fantastic none the less. worth every penny.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was surprised at all of the bad reviews here. I was up till 3 am finishing the novel and was crying and unable to sleep.  This book is supposed to be disturbing. This is what war does to people.  That was the point.  SC created characters that we get involved with and watch Katniss and Peeta fall in love in the first 2 books so that when we watch the relationships and characters get ravaged by war, we understand what it does to people.  They heal, but are forever changed.    One theme that I haven't seen mentioned is that the revolutionary leaders are not much better than President Snow or the Capitol government.  I was extremely impressed that she went into this, watching how Gale's personality changes from a miner who saves people from underground mining accidents, to a military tactician and weapons expert who doesnt understand that burying all the people under a mountain is not morally justified just so that the rebels win.  This was the actual case in the French and Russian revolutions in real history.  They overthrew the monarchs of there countries, but then created a much worse situation than was there to begin with.  I think of Coin as a Madame Defarge from \\"A Tale of Two Cities,\\" using the rebels to gain power, with no care for human element in District 13.  She has created a whole community of successful but lackluster lives- gray clothing, bland food, no dancing, no pets, all goal of personal fulfillment to be sacrificed for the greater good.  Could be the ideals of communist Russia?  So when Gale speaks of how they have to bury the fortress for the greater good of the rebels, we realize then that he has given himself over to a new mentality and the war has changed him forever.  That is when she lost him.  He is still her fellow soldier, but that is all.    I saw a lot of people write about how the story was slow when they were in the capitol, but I felt that it was more suspenseful and realistic to how guerrilla warfare would actually be.    Most importantly, I felt the resolution between the love triangle was secondary to all the other themes in the book because the innocence of the characters is lost.  Peeta and Katniss had people use their love for each other as weapons against them.  Johanna's character talks about how she stops loving people so she can no longer be hurt.  This is what it takes to for them to survive- its not as if war stops and people just heal right up and go back to normal life. Katniss comes back in physical and emotional pain that she wants dulled and wants to retreat from.  I wept because this book gave insight to our soldiers' story- of being young and innocent and full of hope, then going to war and coming back a damaged shell and expected to return from hell and the next week get a job and be a normal person.  It showed the reasons behind the high rates of drug abuse and alcoholism in veterans returning from war.  The conflicting feelings of guilt, compassion, and hate for your enemies (which I thought Katniss exemplified in how she felt about her stylists), were wonderful in this book.  You dont get a choice at the end. There is no Team Gale and Team Peeta.  Who in life really does?  Not many people get a fairytale, although we are sold that story from childhood.  What is impressive is that they are willing to pick up the pieces of their lives together and move forward. That is true love.    I felt as if this is a series that all young people should read and be discussed with an adult to explain the violence and meaning behind it.  I rate it up there with \\"Brave New World,\\" \\"1984,\\" and \\"Johnny Got His Gun.\\"
0375428232|3.0|The product was good and in perfect condition. The CD also works fine. But I won't suggest this book as the best study material for TOEFL.

B0073LWEXK|4.0|A lot of fun while it lasted, but it was a pretty short experience. I was able to finish in a little over a hour. Look forward to playing again in a couple of months, once I forget how to solve it. Runs great on the Kindle Fire, pleasant graphics and sounds. Fantastic game, but loses one star for length.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Having previously owned a 2nd generation Kindle for which I chose a cover for looks over function, with my new Kindle Fire I wanted something a little more sleek and that was more about purpose than style. This lightweight microshell folio cover fit those needs perfectly.<br /><br />After receiving it, I felt the price was a bit high, but as for function, it works exactly the way I hoped it would. The cover is extremely lightweight and does not add a lot of noticeable extra weight to the device.  It is definitely a \\"shell\\" type cover in that the Kindle just snaps right in like a frame.<br /><br />The inside of the cover is lined with felt so as to protect the screen.  The rubber banded strap that holds the cover closed is a nice touch as well.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the cover which also serves as an easel does not lock in place and does not really hold the device up very well if you are going to play games or be touching the screen quite repeatedly.  Since I use my device mainly for reading, and don't really use the easel function at all, I don't mind it. But I did want to mention this since other reviewers have pointed it out as well. The cover will see a lot of wear and tear if eventually if you continuously use it as an easel.<br /><br />Overall, great cover if you want something minimalistic and not too heavy, which I did. As far as protecting the device if you drop it, taking price into consideration, and needing a good easel for your reader, this one may not be the right fit for you.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|From the moment I started reading, until the moment I finished the last page six hours later I was completely enthralled with the story, and it's intricate characters. Very good read, especially if you enjoy a bit of puzzle solving, and enjoy a protagonist triumph.  Overall? Worth the money. Hope they turn it into a movie. I'm sure it would be very popular.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my mom.  It turned out well, shipped on time, and visually was great for Jurassic Park fans.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The Night Circus is a story like none I've ever heard or imagined.  Two characters, star-crossed lovers perhaps, are thrown unwillingly into a competition that neither of them understand the rules of, who their opponents are, or what the consequences might be if either were to win or lose.  The only tools they have to use at their disposal is their own minds and ingenuity.  Set in a circus that only opens after the sun has set, each competitor creates world after world of impossibilities.  The details described so vividly that you'll shiver when you enter the ice garden or close your eyes to imagine the stars in the star gazer.  The book will only pull you in further as you start to connect with the Romeo and Juliet-esque characters and you start to feel what they feel.  This is, after all, the sign of a superb story.  \\"The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones.\\"  If you're still skeptical, let the words of the preceding soak in, as they were taken from the book itself.  Then, prepare to dive into a world of wonder.  I am so delighted that I stumbled upon this book and I would like to thank Erin for writing it.  For letting us explore her mind and believe in the impossible, if only for 387 pages.  I found that I could easily make this into a film in my mind.  Picturing the characters' faces, movements, personalities.  Seeing their illusions, masterpieces, art.  I urge you to explore this book and let it wrap you up in a warm crimson scarf.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|There seems to be some disagreement about whether PJ Harvey lost her touch by the mid-90s (after an album or two) or whether she is actually getting better with age.  Well, I like all of her, old and new!  Just because her sound has softened up a bit does not mean she's lost her edge or even her \\"angst-ridden\\" persona, and that is more than enough reason for Let England Shake having been named the album of the year by more critics + music magazines than any other this past year. If anything, this album captures the best of all worlds in a brief 40 minutes, at once melodic yet jarring, gorgeous yet horrifying, other-worldly yet down to earth, and ethnic yet western rock-sounding.  Ignore the nay-sayers and find out for yourself why this woman is deservedly considered to be miles ahead of the huge majority of female artists out there.  If, on the other hand, Adele and other flaccid singers are your cup of tea, then there's no reason for you to even bother listening here.
B005WY8YZW|5.0|If you are a fan of Puscifer, no more needs to be said about the mustic. If you aren't, then you will probably like this if you like alternative, whimsical, varied music. Be aware this CD appears to be created on-demand (the CD insert says \\"Amazon\\" on the inside of it), much like recording a CD on your PC. It plays fine on all my CD players except in my 2000 Jeep Wrangler. That CD player is unable to play CDs recorded on PCs, though it plays \\"regular\\" CDs just fine. Probably just old technology in the vehicle, but in case you've noticed something similar in your CD player...
B004SH40BQ|5.0|The i10s is very small yet works perfectly to make the Nano (or other iPod) bluetooth capable.  I am using it on my Nano 6G which is in my Tik Tok watch band.  The combination looks and works very well.  I am using it in my Jabra earbuds while jogging, biking and even have it connected to my bluetooth motorcycle helmet.  A GREAT item and very reasonably priced.  I highly recommend it.

B0009XNUK0|5.0|This is probably the best comprehensive album any MJ fan could ask for.  Beginning with early Jackson 5 music and carrying you through later years of MJ's solo career.  All his best work.  It's a must have and I have listened to it endlessly!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This sequel to the Hunger Games develops our characters from the first book more and even brings in some new ones that play integral roles in the final book.  I enjoyed this book a lot and found it easy to read and fast paced.  It did read more like an intermediary book, in which many of the themes that are just touched upon in the first book are more thoroughly developed to lead you into the final book in the series.
B005R4255C|5.0|I loved every bit of this disc because it gives you all of MJ's music from the beginning to the end.  It mixes the music so you get to hear a few songs in one and it's mixed in a really cool way the flows well.  MJ woulda been proud.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I resisted the Hunger Games because it is listed as youth reading.  I don't usually like reading books intended for young readers (i.e. Harry Potter) but I decided to give this book a try.  I was really surprised at what a great book this is, it is very fast paced and keeps your attention gripped from the beginning.  I did however think it was much too violent and somewhat sadistic for young readers.  Definitely worth your time but make sure you have time to finish the entire series once you start.
B004FRX0MY|2.0|My  android music app has a history of keeping my old playlist and not keeping a new playlist-- my phone is musically stuck  with playlist from 6 months ago. Every time I delete an old playlist, then create a new playlist, the app won't keep the new playlist on the phone for longer than 2 days. That's ridiculous.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I just finished this book last night and it left me feeling lost and empty, yet this was the only possible way to end the series.  Collins took this book to a stark reality.  There is nothing sugar coated or fantasy-like about this final chapter.  The emotions and reality that characters we love must die and the void that follows such an event are what makes the Hunger Games trilogy as meaningful as it is.  Otherwise it would be just a wild story, but Collins forces us to an uncomfortable place, a place where we have to face real feelings and outcomes.  I did however feel like the end of the book rushed.  ***SPOILER*** There is that moment when Katniss is on fire from the silver parachute bombs and then she just wakes up days later in the hospital and the war is over...somehow that bothered me, it was so anti-climatic.  Then again after she kills Coin, she is in her room and then released and we are given a very brief synopsis of events from Plutarch on what happened.  These were major events in the book.  It was almost like Collins had to squish the book into a set number of pages and she was saving some for Katniss' grieving period.  I just wish that after all the time and emotion that the reader has invested in the books, we would have been included in the final events unfolding instead of having Plutarch quickly bring us up to speed.  Barring this though the book was the perfect way to wrap up the series and leave the reader pondering the many different angles and meanings.

B0067QPVD2|5.0|I have waited for years to see exactly what happened at the Sweedish (Ok Norwegian) camp.  This movie delivers way above my expectations and handles all ties to John Carpenter's version completely.  In the \\"making of\\" they expressly said their intention was to tell parts of the story that didn't get told by the 1982 version.  Now, I am ready for what happened AFTER the 1982 version.  I just hope it is not another 20 years!  The use of a combination of CGI and animatronics kept the feel of JC's version and helped maintain a feel of continuity between the films.  Loved it!
B001F12J0C|5.0|The high action Bourne Trilogy belongs in everyone's film library, in my opinion.  Jason Bourne hardly ever stops to take a breath.  The Trilogy from Amazon is competitivly priced and a recommended buy for anyone looking for these movies.

B004LROUW2|1.0|I am a huge reader and a sci-fi fan. I am also a very quick reader. That being said, I had to stop reading this terrible book half way in, which is the length of at least 3 novels. The author appears to be obsessed with sex, and most of the sex in the book is bordering on deviant--sex with little girls, sexual abuse, the list goes on. I thought that the characters spent far too long over-thinking everything and we were subjected to whole chapters of their musings, with little actual action. All of the characters appear stuck in some kind of neurosis. Additionally, so much of the book is surrounding the evil side of people, even the \\"good\\" characters have moral issues. It is probably one of the most boring and pointless reads I have ever read. What a let-down! Don't belive all the gushing reviews.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|one of the best apps out there. games are fun. wouldn't get rid of this app for any other app.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|Wow!  I had to leave a review.  Ms. Hamilton really hit it out of the park with the paranormal fantasy world she created.  I was hooked right from the start with my sympathy for the main character, Sophia.  She is a bit dark and very misunderstood, but I really liked her.  I found myself turning the pages wondering if she'd ever be vindicated or if she'd ever get the validation she truly deserved.  I also really loved the world that the author built.  This isn't just another vampire book.  No sparkles here.  There is a healthy dose of paranormal warfare though.  Frightening and unnatural characters are introduced throughout and each has its own unique purpose.  Some are there to support Sophia and some have aligned with the evils powers that be.  The reader is propelled to turn those pages to find out who is who.  It's all very unpredictable.  Fun to try and figure out.  Another aspect that I enjoyed was that Sophia is Wiccan.  This seems to be a fresh concept in this genre.  And let's not be confused with Wicca and witchcraft.  Oh, there are spells and creepy ceremonies, but make no mistake, this isn't for kids.  This is epic level supernatural battle.  I heard this is a series and I am so excited for the next edition.  Kudos to Ms. Hamilton for creating a unique and captivating world.
0785145494|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the most wonderful sagas of Marvel Comics of all time. I say that because Thanos is the most brilliant characters of superhero stories, smarter than cosmic entities. Years ago, when this story was published at the first time, we already were waiting for a new Thanos saga, after the cosmic cube saga against Captain Marvel and Earth's superheroes. But a story against all the main Marvel's cosmic entities was really a big surprise. And the idea of the gems with different powers, used in amalgam was priceless. And the conclusion is amazing. In the past we had some other great sagas, like Beyonder's saga (Secret Wars, a milestone in Marvel universe...), but nothing like that... Thanos is impressive, smart, brillant, evil, powerful and sometimes funny. This is one of my favorite villains in comic books and this is my favorite story with him...
B005HSG3VK|3.0|Wanted something lit weight and affordable. This cover is perfect for these 2 needs. If u want a cover that is very sturdy for stand up this is not the one for softer surfaces like watching videos in bed.
B00004W221|5.0|Rudy comes from a blue collar town to Notre Dame where he gives his all to the Fightin' Irish football team in hopes of being a player on the team. All he ever wanted to do was play for Notre Dame. This is an inspirational story.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|Love the game as a game -- the hidden objects are fairly hidden, the story is gripping, and the hints are plentiful. It's a little hard to play on a tablet (I'm using a Kindle Fire) because the objects can be too tiny for my stubby fingers to accurately target; all the same, it usually picks up on my pokes just fine, and I'm not playing for a record score.<br /><br />There are a couple of drawbacks, though:<br />-- When you quit the game, you save at the beginning of that level. This means if you get interrupted or something, you'll have to start that section at the beginning next time, and some of the sections are longish.<br />-- The price is high for a tablet game. It seems much more playable than many, but it surprised me all the same.<br />-- I STRONGLY resent having game play interrupted so they can push me to write a review, especially when I intended to anyway. This review would have been five stars if I didn't get the feeling the reviews aren't exactly spontaneous.<br /><br />In short: Great game, lousy marketing. Trust your product to generate the good reviews, and stop trying to stuff the ballot box!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|I am amazed that no one thought of this idea sooner.  I am not crazy about cowboy and Indians movies because the Indian is usually portrayed so falsely in every way.  But the aliens in this movie were truly the bad guys.  The movie was engaging, amusing and downright funny in many places.  We LOVED it!
B0058P4QY8|5.0|These stories as well as the kindle edition is 'most excellent' as Holmes would say. The Sidney Paget illustrations along with the low price for 4 of the 9 books in the Holmes canon is the best deal going. The pictures really make the difference especially when I want to sit at night and read and be taken back to Victorian England to enjoy the adventures of the worlds most famous consulting detective. All stories are written by AC Doyle but written such that they are told to us by Dr Watson in the form of a story written for magazine publication - he is Holmes' chronicler, so to speak.<br /><br />This edition has an active TOC and includes four books - not the entire canon. Although the stories stand alone they really should be read in order. That means ideally starting with two books not included here. A Study in Scarlet the first book, a novel, and introduces Holmes to his dear friend Watson. The second book, A Sign of Four, also a novel, includes how Watson meets his wife. Then the next four books are what is included in this edition, Adventures of SH, Memoirs of SH, Hound of the Baskervilles, and The Return of SH. These books, with the exception of Hound Baskervilles, are all short stories, about 12 each, Hound is a novel and can be read last but was actually written third of these four. The Final Solution, last story in the second book, Memoirs, is the one and only story where Holmes MEETS Prof Moriarty and when Doyle decided to kill off Holmes and move onto other projects - actually in the novel, [[ASIN:B003XYE7XG The Valley Of Fear (Sherlock Holmes Vol. 7)]], Moriarty is referenced but they never tangle and that novel was written long after he was killed. But the public wanted more Holmes so almost 10 years later he wrote the novel, Hound of Baskervilles. A year after that he brought Holmes back, in a credible way (not like the TV show Dallas did long ago with Bobby) in the short story, \\"The Empty House\\" the first story in the Return of SH book- which is also were Doyle refers to Watsons wife having past away during Holmes absence. This lets Watson move back in with his good friend Mr Sherlock Holmes at 221b Baker Street. So you can read Hound of the Baskervilles at the end or almost anytime but the short stories are best read in order.<br /><br />As mentioned above there are a total of 9 books in the Holmes canon and it all begins with two novels, Study in Scarlet and Sign of Four followed by the four books in this edition. After reading all those that comes two more books of short stories, His Last Bow and Case Book of SH plus another novel, Valley of Fear. A total of 60 stories written over about 40 years. But the public wanted more so everything else are pastiches.<br /><br />These stories obviously stood the test of time and deviate from most of the Hollywood productions like Basil Rathone and Nigel Bruce movies of the 40's, which makes Watson a bumbling fool and stereotypes the expression \\"elementary\\" - don't expect to read much of that in originals. The real stories show that Holmes and Watson had a deep friendship and mutual respect for each other. The latest 2010 - 2012 modern Masterpiece TV versions with Benedict Bumberbatch are pretty darn good but the relationship between these two friends is not even close. Plus, the new series is too politically correct - the real Holmes is a smoker, cigarettes, pipe, tobacco and will smoke on a problem while the new series uses a nicotine patch. Anyway, the original stories are great, and if you want to watch most of these stories on television in a way that is actually extremely faithful to the original canon then pick up this most excellent [[ASIN:B000RPCJB6 Sherlock Holmes: The Complete Granada Television Series]]. Nothing compares to this series, nothing - read the reviews. I recently purchased the series and watch it after I have read the original stories. Read the book before the movie/TV show, you'll be glad you did.<br /><br />Plus, a side note of Holmes characteris that between cases, when nothing is going on to keep his brain stimulated,Holmes may simply get wasted. Yes, he did drugs. We learn this in the beginning of Sign of the Four when Watson says to Holmes, \\"What is it today? I asked, morphine of cocaine\\"....\\"It is cocaine, he said, - a seven percent solution. Would you care to try it?\\" 7% refers to the mixture of cocaine to water in his syringe when he shot up. The movie [[ASIN:B005ETAMHS The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (Universal Vault Series)]] revolves around this and is actually a very good movie, one of the best, even though the story is a pastiche, not written by Doyle, and gets treated for his drug addiction by Sigmund Freud (a real cocaine addict) - highly recommended.<br /><br />So bottom line, great stories a highly recommend version for Kindle since it has a great TOC and those wonderful illustrations that were published in the Strand magazine when these stories were published. The illustrations occasionally are important to see to follow a case, like a map, or figure in the Dancing Men story. They help to create the mood and feel of those days. Also, there are words that may be confusing so the Kindle edition, with dictionary, helps a lot - like dog-cart and Brougham and calabash...<br /><br />Great read!!!is that between cases, when nothing is going on to keep his brain stimulated,Holmes may simply get wasted.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app. I find it to be accurate and detailed, from hourly forecasting to many days in advance. would recommend to anyone.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is the best little folio for the Kindle Fire.  It is a cover to keep from damaging the unit and it can also fold into a stand so that it can be viewed without holding it.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This little sharpener is great and a must to take on any outdoors trip. You never know when your knife will need a little sharpening. Works good, gives a nice sharp edge to the knifes. I've used it on machetes, bowie knives, pocket knives, and multi tool knives. Overall its a great little product well worth the price.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This has become my favorite \\"feel good\\" movie, I've watched it several times.  The actors do a great job!  Love Sandra Bullock, Betty White, and Ryan Reynolds.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|right what needed, very good quality, exelente CD, special and soon arrival to house, but than waited for a very economic price
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really enjoy this game and the free version makes it al the better.  it is a great app and instead of one game you get multiple different games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good game. only just started playing but so far so good. might get repetitive but we will see. some are hard but that could be a good thing.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|i like this game. too bad you have to pay to finish it though. i like finding the hidden objects.
B002ZG981E|5.0|Amazing movie, never gets old.  Seeing it in Blu-Ray made it just as good as in theaters.  Nothing special comes with it, not that anything extra is needed.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a good game to play every once in a while, but not every game is good.  The up side to this is that for every terrible game there is a fun one to make up for it. you have to win games and get points to unlock new games. there is something for everyone. all in all, a good game
B000B5UL7G|5.0|right what needed, very good quality, exelente CD, special and soon arrival to house, but than waited for a very economic price
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I give this a five star rate because it works perfect on my kindle fire and plus I love ANGRY BIRDS :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|has many versions of the Bible and also has the audio to go with it. Great for any portable device.
B005T87QCI|4.0|This is an okay game. How ever, it does take forever to get loaded up, it is a fun game, controls are difficult to learn. I would recommend his game, but beware it may not work for kindle fire.
B0024FAR5M|4.0|Had no problems wirh my order receive it timely matter.  Yhe price was reasonable.  Didn't have to check on order. Received earlier than expected
B000Q66JXA|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movie. I first saw it at the theatre. It was 1980. I watched  Excalibur and Star Wars on the same night. I really thought they both had a lot in common. I would recommend this movie for anyone who likes King Arthur movies. Well worth the time.
1849162743|5.0|Imagine how suprized I was that no where in the book does our girl kick a hornets' nest?<br />Well, it was really a great book anyway. Rather long but it needed it to be to explain everything. I was impressed w/the trilogy but as usual I wish there were more books. This last one surely was left open to continued episodes.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is a great compliment to my Kindle Fire.  It fits perfectly, is lightweight and comfortable to hold and very adequately protects the Fire.  I like the fact that it can be adjusted to use as a stand so I don't have to keep holding the Fire while reading.
B005T87QCI|4.0|nice game, the only thing missing are the main characters in the movie atom and zeus, beside that everything is good, works well on kindle fire.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great app! hours of fun if you like solitarie. I like the fact that you can choose your own bacgriund board and card backs.  the option to play random deals or solvable deals is awesome.
B004EPYZXK|3.0|\\"Apollo 18\\" takes the 'found foootage' horror methodology (think \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Paranormal Activity\\") and takes it off world. You thought Apollo 17 was our last lunar mission? You think the Russians never landed on the moon? Got news for you conspiracy minded types out there; neither of these is true. Sent up under the guise of a National Security/Department of Defense kind of Top Secret mission, our three astronauts board the Liberty and Freedom vehicles for one more investigation of what's really up there. It ain't the Sea of Tranquility, that's for sure.<br /><br />Before you know it, something is making creepy noises outside the Lunar Module. Samples are suddenly not where the explorers originally left them. And them dastardly things ripped up the USA flag! Not only are these critters scary, they're downright UnAmerican! Then again, they weren't too nice to the Ruskie that landed there before Apollo 18, and the unlucky astronauts realize that their government may not have told them everything about their journey or its intended mission. The handheld cameras soon begin jerking and spinning, the automatic cameras are going static, and the humans just might be losing their minds.<br /><br />\\"Apollo 18\\" mixes just enough \\"now-you-see-it\\" spookiness to add some real scare jolts, but mostly, it's dopey space B-Movie fun. The Metal Munching Moon Mice from the old Bullwinkle cartoons were about as believable as the space bug monsters wreaking havoc on our helpless heroes, and some of the effects are laughably bad. There's plenty of stock footage in use to help make the original bits work chronologically, however, as a horror movie is concerned, the green cheese that is \\"Apollo 18\\"? It certainly isn't rocket science.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I first saw the movie \\"Star Wars\\" in 1980. It is the 4th movie in this collection. I later saw  The 5th and 6th. I thought that was all. I am looking forward to watch the first three. This is a great action and adventure movie. It will make you want to get off the couch and help. I recommend this collection to everyone who likes good movies.
B006W0QOF2|4.0|I did enjoy the slow burn of this film, the understated, almost leisurely approach to tension.<br /><br />But I checked out emotionally for the same reason that I check out emotionally from most films:  when the behavior of the characters on the screen resembles in no way human behavior as I recognize it.  In the case of this film, that happened when the guy was kissing the girl in the elevator, while the assassin was standing right there.<br /><br />Yeah, right.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is just amazing. Listen and read the Good News. This app will help you to do exactly that. Amen. Amen. Amen.
B00005K3O4|5.0|was so happy to find this movie. i watched when i was a little kid and remember being so scared. worked great and was fast shipping
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing book. I flew through it and immediately moved on to the second one... because the first one really leaves you hanging! So just be prepared to do that because you really will be hooked. Great story and leaves you thinking about what goes on behind the scenes of your government and television. Do not shy away from the \\"young-adult\\" category. This is a great adult-adult book as well!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy conviniant Most of all I love that it reminds me  that I have to read my daily reading plan
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible even more than my Fire Bible because I can set this to ding at me ifl I haven't for read it for the day.<br />This truly helped me get a committed Bible reading plan and now I cant just have one reading plan I have to have 2 or 3
B00447G29S|5.0|This was the very first 3D movie I watched on my Mitsubishi 65\\" DLP TV with Xpand103 glasses.  I had never seen the entire movie before and had no idea what to expect.  The movie itself completely came alive with the 3D depth.  I was mesmerized from beginning to end.  This isn't in-your-face 3D:  it adds to the experience instead of being the movie's focus.  I loved the falling snow in the beginning, the rollercoaster-style scenes, the train skidding across the ice, the ticket in the wind, etc etc.  The 3D clarity was amazing with virtually zero ghosting.  Some of the facial expressions did seem artificial but this is 2004 technology.  All things considered, this move was VERY impressive.  I enjoyed the storyline as well....not too much syrupy holiday sweetness.  I can't wait to watch this movie again....I just wish the DVD extras were in 3D!
1444904841|5.0|Very cute book and although I haven't heard the CD yet, looking forward to it. I will purchase more in the future.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Very good app, non-intrusive ads, very lovely. However, it's a bit awkward to use. You have to click the suggestions that pop up when you attempt to search, else they simply dismiss and you have to restart the application.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is so fun, you fling the bird and hope to knock down the pig's building. great for kids 6-12.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|make more of these games loved it. even though played in one day had fun and the graphics are great
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I rate this app 4 stars because sometimes it is a little glitches y and the controls don't always s work good (but usually they work okay).  this app is a good time consumer if you want but if you just want/ need to play a quick game it is perfect for that too.  I think that considering that this app is free that it is good
B005HSG3TC|5.0|this product is great, best protection we have every seen for the kindle fire, the shell is hard type and seams like it will take a lot of abuse
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It works great. I just need to get in the habit of charging it. I recommend not plugging it in to you computer unless you alway keep it on.
B005HSL626|5.0|I really cant stand bad reviews because it takes my hopes wayyyy down and guilts me out every time. I really love this (I didn't even know there was adds untill I read that there was!) ( party poopers!)
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I should have got this when I bought the fire. I was thinking I will buy another kindle every 2 years anyway like my smartphone so why buy a cover? This is not only light and protects the fire but the best part is it work as a stand also. Even when I hold it with the cover it is easier then without it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|My device is Kindle Fire.  I use this app to manage my note and not to forget my important tasks.  Esp. I think this is really good if u use multiple devices like me. In my case, I use desktop computer, kindle, android phone. This app makes these devices synchronized well, thus enabling u to get the same, exact information at anytime and anywhere like ubiquitous world.
1416550550|2.0|I was so excited to start reading this book after three of my friends told me how wonderful it was.  I on the other hand had a really hard time getting though it.    The book is written about multiple characters with a timeline that jumps around.  First it's about the grandmother, then the grandaughter then the great grandmother and so on.  It was really hard to go back and forth from character story to different character story.    I'm really glad other people thought this was a great read.  It took me forever to get through, not a lot of action and really slow going.  It was not enjoyable for me!
B006E4QCXU|3.0|I found it to be DULL on my Xoom Tablet even after making adjustments in the settings.  Try &quot;FLEYA&quot; which is free on the Android Market.  It has very beautiful, Colorful, FLUID GRAPHICS that are awesome and has many options to change.  Much better than Gravilux.
0718157834|4.0|It took me a long time to find the courage to review this book. Me Before You was a very intense read for me. I picked it up and couldn't let go. I was glued to the pages till 5 AM in the morning and some more after to digest what I just read- or well to stop crying. It is a tearjerker like I never read one before. For all those romance lovers hereI want to make one thing clear: this is not a romance novel in my definition and I'm sure most of you will agree. I knew it wouldn't be before I started but still this book caught me off guard.<br /><br />Meet Lou, she lives at her parents place has a job she loves in a coffee shop and well she is happy with her life for the most time. When out of nowhere she loses her job,she has to find something new to help her family. The jobcenter suggest a caring job for a local young man and Lou isn't sure she can do it. It is a temporary assignment which would only last 6 months so she takes the risk and takes it. When she meets Will and realizes what her real job is aka giving him back his will to life her determination to do just that is spiked and she gives her best.<br /><br />Will is a quadriplegic and his life is ruled by his body's condition. He's dependant on outside help and he hates every second of it. His life before the accident was a very active one- he was always looking for the next adrenaline high. A life full of adventures and risks. Now he has lost all of this including his will to live and he actually only waits for his suffering to end. He knows what he wants- his plan is to visit a hospiz in Switzerland to do what he wouldn't be allowed to do in his home-country.<br /><br />There are so many things I adored in this book. I loved to see how realistically the relationship between Lou and Will developed. The slow building up of their connection eases you into the story- you take this whole journey into a foreign world together with Lou. Ms Mojes seems to have researched Quadriplegia intensively and the background information we get piece by piece was eye opening for me. I also loved that actually not the things Lou plotted out to get Will back to enjoy life worked but that actually her character did. Her spirit and while demeanor is the key.She is not afraid to tell him the truth- bluntly and honest without hesitating of fear to hurt his feelings.<br />I also liked how the side cast and their stories were seamlessy woven into the story but never stole the spotlight from the main theme.<br /><br />My biggest problem with the book is actually a bit of a spoilery topic. So skip this if you plan to read this book and want to be unbiased while doing so.<br /><br />When I got the chance to receive this book I read a bit about it and I thought it would be an optimistic book. About finding the pleasure of life again, finding new hope and all. For me a \\"romantic\\" read isn't this sad and the end seriously killed the book for me. I read for hours in the whee hours of the morning and then the end hit me so hard I couldn't take it. I was devasted and well here this book succeded- it really touched me deep inside and made me cry for hours. But sadly it also ruined the whole reading experience for me. Now when I think of Me Before You I remember the end and well not much of the rest. Perhaps it's just me being a pampered romance reader but I couldn't shake off the emotional intensity Ms Moyes build over the whole book so easily.<br /><br />Me Before You will grab you and wrench every last tear out of your body. It didn't only make me cry though- there are also some very funny and sweet moments in this book. I really enjoyed the book but the romance reader in me is wishing that I would have never read the end. If you love the sweetness and happiness of romance novels this one might not be for you but if you love the emotional intensity no matter if good or bad grab this one- it is a wonderfully crafted emotional roller-coaster ride.ece was eye opening for me.

B0055SWM08|5.0|I find this game to be very relaxing and also very interesting.  thank you for a great game I appreciate it
B000S1M9LY|5.0|I guess I should start off this review by acknowledging that I didn't get it all.  There were subtexts, clues, and jokes that I undoubtedly missed.<br /><br />But wow.<br /><br />David Foster Wallace wrote an epic -- a novel that no one else could have ever written.  Unlike many works, it is so abundantly clear that Wallace put *everything* into this novel.  And what a novel it is.<br /><br />So what is it about?  Well, there is a lot going on, but the underlying theme of all the various stories (really, three independent threads that finally sort of come together at the end) is addiction, desperation, and dissatisfaction.  The first story, probably the main story (especially early on) involves the Incandenza family, specifically Hal Incandenza, a rising start at Enfield Tennis Academy, and his rapidly increasing use (and addiction) to marijuana.  Mirroring this story is the story of Don Gately, a mostly-recovered addict who works at a drugs/alcohol recovery house.  And the third story is a search by would-be terrorists for a video-tape that causes the viewer to stop everything they do and become -- yep, you guessed it -- addicted to watching the tape.<br /><br />It is bizarre.  But it is rewarding.<br /><br />A note regarding the Kindle version: I cannot imagine reading it any other way.  The text of the actual hard copy is quite small, the book is gargantuan, and the numerous (300+) footnotes are actually endnotes, requiring constant flipping back and forth.  While it is occasionally inconvenient to click the notes with the Kindle, it is much easier than flipping.  I encountered occasional little glitches with the Kindle version (what appeared to be very minor typos), but overall I think that the Kindle version is the way to go -- highly recommended.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Ever since I picked up a copy of Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte I have been in love.  I believe this movie truly does the book justice.  I have watched other versions (new and old) of this classic novel, but for whatever reason I keep coming back to this 2006 version.  Honestly I think it is because nobody plays Mr. Rochester as well as Toby Stephens.  The whole mood of the film is hopelessly romantic without losing substance.  It wonderfully written and acted! I will always love Jane Eyre forever and ever!
B001P9EQH8|1.0|I have to give this item a negative, 1-star rating because the one I purchased was defective right out of the package. This amplifier runs on a built-in lithium ion battery that charges through a USB port. After more than 10 hours of charging, the battery would not hold any charge whatsoever. It would only operate when connected to the USB charger. It was as if the battery had become disconnected. The battery is built in and cannot be user accessed (or replaced). I may be one of very few people to have received a defective unit. If that is the case, it was my bad luck and you may have a much better experience. However, I become very suspicious of any unit that is defective straight out of the package; it does not speak well for the manufacturer's quality control. One thing I noticed is that the unit had been manufatured about nine months earlier. I was not permitted to request an exchange on this purchase; I could only return it for a refund. Therefore, I ordered the newer model (the Fiio E6 Headphone Amplifier) as a replacement for about $8.00 more.

1591844096|1.0|I bought this book because many people I respect claim that the author is among their favourites.  Linchpin has got to be one of the worst books I have ever read on the subject.  It is pretentious, over the top and useless from a practical perspective.  It is pretentious because the author, by writing cliché after cliché, believes the book to be inspirational.  It is over the top because the message could have been delivered in 50 pages, as opposed to the existing 236.  It is useless because there is no practical advice or strategy.  There are 14 chapters if you include the introduction and the summary. I got fed up after chapter 4. A day went by and I decided to give the book another chance. I couldn't get past chapter 5.  I'll give you one example of how the book is built.  In chapter 5, the author focuses on the benefits of:  1. Emotional labor;  2. Giving without expecting nothing in return;  3. Art, which can be defined as \\"a personal gift that changes the recipient\\".  The author expands on number 3 by starting with the following: \\"An artist is an individual who creates art. The more (...)\\". He goes on for a page and a half. Then he starts a new section. The first line within this new section is the following: \\"Art is created by an artist\\" (???!!!). And then he goes on repeating everything he said for the remainder of the chapter (it's a 20 page chapter) with different words, interspersed with a cliché here and there. Moreover, the message stays at such a high level that there is no practical advice to extract.  By writing the same thing over and over, just using different words, I think the author is trying to strike a few memorable quotes. He fails miserably because his message is as old as the Old Testament.  I am donating this book to the library tomorrow. I hope they don't cancel my membership...

B002GJT4XW|5.0|This Ultimate Edition of hte movie is EXCELLENT.  It includes about 8 minutes of materiel that I had never seen before.  The extra features are there from the origional package, plus more.  Great job, Warner Bros.!
0061148512|5.0|If you want to know what it is like to live under a bell jar, this is the novel to read.  Depressing, yes, but at the same time enlightening.  I highly recommend it.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I will admit I am not as much of a minimalist as Miss Minimalist. But that is not the point! This book is the perfect counterpoint to the buy-buy-buy/have-have-have messages that we seem to receive so frequently in our culture. Just knowing that someone like Francine Jay is out there gives my perspective exactly the balance it needed. I feel refreshed, invigorated, and re-focused on what is really important! As I read, I never got the feeling that she was recommending that we be exactly like her, just that she was sharing the joy that she takes in the elegance and simplicity of minimalism. Francine Jay, I owe you a big thank you - and so, I believe, does our entire culture for the positive messages you are sending out into the cultural consciousness.
0307593312|1.0|I've been a big fan.  However, this is the most self indulgent pulp I've ever read.  Murakami has gone into a land of writing completely for his own \\"process\\" without any thought of giving the reader something of substance.  If he continues in this stream of lame redundancy, he's done.  Really horrifying.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Best book Ive read in a very long time! Its written VERY well and I couldn't put my kindle down after I started reading it. Definitely would recommend it to those who like to read books such as Cassandra Clares' series The mortal Instruments and Infernal Devices
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I love this book. disclaimer - I am not a young adult but an adult who enjoys reading good young adult fiction particularly with interesting societies and strong female main characters. This book is that plus the writing stye is beautiful. despite the heartaches of love it made me grateful I live in a world where love in all its variations is notdeclared sick.  but here is my annoyance and why i did not rate it 5.  day old bagels? Mylanta,? Advil? wouldn't the culture have changed that mch from our present day? would these brands products customs still exist?reading about these things took me out of the story briefly due to my disbelief. but was able to disregard since everything else so great otherwise.  second pet peeve: operation takes place age 18. puberty happens age 13 or so. society is really able to keep teens apart for that many years even with curfew and occasional heads being busted by cops?
0393312836|4.0|So much of what we read in this book we see around us today.  The gangs where members have no parents and make the gang their family.  The violence that comes from living in a violent world. Government remedies that treat the effect, not the cause for the crime.  This is a must read!
B003QSO11W|5.0|Much funnier than I'd remembered, this twisting tale of competing hitmen and their uncharacteristically jovial attempts to rid the world of one other also finds the time to address the loss of innocence, the reflections of a milestone high school reunion and the baggage of leading a necessarily isolated lifestyle. John Cusack is fantastic as the acidic, sarcastic prodigal son, returning to his home town on business while also giving serious thought to abandoning his violent ways for good. Great supporting work helps that role to flower even further, especially in the forms of his grinning, kill-happy competition, (a joyously nasty dark turn by Dan Aykroyd) the jilted love interest he left high and dry ten years back (Minnie Driver at her most smokin') and his flippant, hard-nosed assistant (Joan Cusack). One of the greatest soundtracks ever, plus work on the original score by former Clash frontman Joe Strummer, takes this whole package over the top. Strongly recommended.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|Before watching this film you have to understand that this is an arthouse flick masquerading as a Gone in 60 Seconds type of film & if you're expecting Gone in 60 seconds or a Michael Bay type of action film you'll be soooo disappointed...On the other hand if you're looking for a smart superbly crafted methodically paced/shot arthouse film you'll adore this! I love both stupid action films & foreign arthouse fair so this film is a match made in heaven & one of the best films ive ever seen even though ive seen dozens of films like this(every cliché in the genre book is presented here but thats beside the point)...This film is in love with itself...Cant give it enough stars...For the folks who hate \\"Drive\\" i understand & i forgive you...lol

B005HSG3TC|4.0|Really do like this kindle cover.  The pointer is better than your finger.  The cover makes holding the kindle easier, almost like holding a book.  Watched a movie with it set up to hold itself up.
0385334206|5.0|This guy was writing black humor before anyone knew what it was.  This is a classic work that will keep you laughing while you ask yourself why.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love using this app in my daily devotions and then following along with the pastor on Sunday.  I especially love being able to share what I'm learning every week so effortlessly.
B0067QPVD2|3.0|I give credit to the crew that made this movie as they tried to stay as faithful to the JC universe as they could.  I felt they needed to flesh out the characters better and make them more interesting.  It was difficult to tell one from the other.  Other than the lead character we never got to know them and never cared if they lived or died.  In JC's version you knew who was who even with the limited time each character had.  The CGI also wasn't the greatest but the 1982 version puppets doesn't hold up well today so CGI is where we are at.  Unfortunately this movie didn't have a Lord Of The Rings type of budget to make that CGI look real.  Overall it's a nice little companion piece to JC's movie.  If you are a fan of the 82 version this is worth a rental.
B000P0I4O4|3.0|I was surprised that two such great actors took on a movie that proved to be boring and very predictable.  I was very disappointed.  I can see why the price was so good.
B0000844I8|5.0|Great start to the Stargate series.  My son couldn't wait to add it to his collection.  Tells how it all originally started.  Actually like the characters in the series better than those in the movie.
0061122416|5.0|This is a delightful book -- simple yet conveying so much wisdom.  It's all about LOVE, a theme running delightfully through Coehlo's works.

B003ZSJ212|1.0|if you liked the originals, you should probably consider not purchasing these revised versions.  if this set included the unaltered originals, it would be worth the money, as is, it's not worth anything
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read all three of these books in about 4 days so it was fast and furious and I was totally immersed. I loved The Hunger Games, really liked Catching Fire and liked Mockingjay. I think that The Hunger Games was so unique and horrific but Katniss was a great character. The story was filled with hardship, love, heartache and strategy. Catching Fire was a familiar place to go and added to the storyline but did get even more political, paranoid and full of conspiracy. Mockingjay took everything to a finale. It all made sense but it didn't mean that I really liked it all. It was very dark, even more violent than the other two, and full of discord, hatred, confusion in the lead character etc. I'm not saying that it wasn't warranted and it all made sense that it would happen this way. It just lacked some of the warm feelings in the first book.<br /><br />It is worth a read to complete the series. It is very graphic (violence) and is not for younger children but then again, the other two are also graphic. It is really a statement on the need for some government control, the corruption of power and ability of people to follow blindly into situations that if given the chance, they would not participate.
B006ZBRMOU|5.0|There are few novels I like or dislike enough to write a review. The writing in this series is such that I feel compelled to put into words how much I enjoyed reading it.

B000GCFO0S|5.0|I love the Silent Hill franchise so this purchase was a must have for me. I love the way they incorporated actual game music into the movie.<br />I will say that I was disappointed that they used some elements that were out of place in tune to the game, but its a motion picture<br />and I know they aren't always the same as the game. I know that Silent Hill:Revelations will be a movie I'm looking forward to. At '<br />the price,its a great deal!

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I searched all of the reviews I could find, and I took a leep of faith and purchased this item. I love it. It is exactly what I wanted/needed for my purposes. I wanted a light weight case that was tough enough to handle a fall from my bedside table. I do wish the back flap was a little better, but overall I am very satisfied with the cover.

B0067LY4WG|5.0|Leonard Cohen has given the heart of lost Love a place to come and worship. I have read many reviews of this and I am no great philosopher but I am afraid that this jewel in the crown of Christianity will be lost on so many who have not struggled and fought the good fight just to be knocked down again. I always thought that there were many good writers and there are some but most writing compared to the depth and reality which Leonard Cohen transcends is just cute quips. If I had not died to the world already, this album would have taken my last breath. Colin P. Sumpter
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time, I was happy to pick up the Blu Ray for such a low price.  For those that don't know make sure and check out Firefly, the TV series that made this movie possible.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|My sister and her husband are avid birders. I know a little about the topic. They are ranked in the top 10 within their home state, for their big year.<br /><br />Bostick (Owen Wilson) is in serious competition. The movie is correct in that birders are on an honor system, although there are doubters which is why birders quickly become decent amateur photographers. Just about every year is a \\"Big Year\\" for birders as they always keep track of what birds they have seen as well as when and where. Most don't have the time or resources to cross the country several times a year, so they compete within their state.<br /><br />The film shows some aspects of birders such as how life interferes with birding. Or how a birder would rather be in Brownsville, Texas at a dump site than in Paris, France. I have discovered that Birders are also acutely aware of things such as global warming as southern birds move north into new areas. They also know the points of illegal crossings as they visit the southern border at odd hours.<br /><br />The movie has 3 diverse quirky characters competing nation wide to be the best birder. Jack Black and Steve Martin are likeable characters while Owen Wilson is the \\"bad guy.\\" I had several laugh out loud moments during this feature. Birding is best done as a couples hobby.<br /><br />Good comedy. Good script.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its so much fun so many games to play.<br />You will never get tired of this app.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Love this Kindle Fire Case. It is very nice and exactly what I was looking for! Love how it stands so you can easily watch videos/read/etc. Worth the $30!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Many of the games are more frustrating than entertaining.  I do have a couple that I have played more than once, and I do mean a couple.  Is it worth downloading?  I am certain that you will find something you like, but it will take time to find it.  Good luck!
B0017HMF6W|5.0|This is a great movie.  Grant is, well, Grant.  Funny and serious at the same time. Still, this is a \\"wrong man\\" movie extraordinaire.  I had not seen this in years, and I had forgotten most of the plot. But seeing it again I could not but wonder how well this story is told.  Hitchcock is a master storyteller.  Even my 8-year old understood and enjoyed the \\"plot\\" and the \\"mix-up\\".  That aside, the blu-ray presents a 16:9 image (1.78:1) of great clarity, with a wonderful color palette, and clear sound.  The \\"restoration\\" (it is a 50-year old movie) is of exceptional quality.  And the \\"digibook\\" art work is also quite a nice touch. All in all, a grand addition to a film lover's collection.
0882709194|1.0|Many reviewers have noted that this edition of The Origin of Species opens with a 50-page introduction by young-Earth creationist Ray Comfort, and that you may know Comfort for a comedy routine about how God has designed the banana perfectly as food for humans.  What they don't mention is that Comfort has also remembered [[ASIN:B000026FOX \\"why the good Lord made your eyes.\\"]] The introduction can be downloaded from the web site of Comfort's ministry, Living Waters, and when it was first posted online, it was quickly noted that the mostly accurate information about Darwin's life was written in a markedly different style from the rest of the introduction. Some sleuthing quickly revealed Comfort had composed this part in the same way an eight-year-old writes a school report: by piecing together uncredited passages from sources he found on the Internet, changing a few words here and there.  The main source is a write-up of Darwin's life by biologist Stan Guffey for the University of Tennessee's first Darwin Day celebration in 1997, but other sources apparently consulted by Comfort include personal web pages about Darwin and Brian Regal's introduction to the Barnes & Noble edition of Darwin's autobiography. Amazon.com rules prevent me from linking to proof, but comparisons can be easily found online. To highlight a few passages:  Comfort: \\"During his great adventure as the Beagle's naturalist, Darwin had studied certain aspects of the morphology and biogeography of the many species of plants and animals that he had observed. He eventually concluded that species exhibited varying degrees of similarity because they were to varying degrees related.\\"  Guffey: \\"On his great adventure as the Beagle's naturalist Darwin had noted and begun to ponder certain aspects of the morphology and biogeography of the many species of plants and animals that he had observed. In particular, he had begun to explore the possibility, and eventually concluded, that species exhibited varying degrees of similarity because they are to varying degrees related.\\"  Comfort: \\"As a clergyman, he would have the free time to follow his real intellectual love: natural history. Darwin was a passionate student of nature, and while still in school he had amassed a considerable beetle collection as well as other specimens.\\"  Regal: \\"As a clergyman, he would have the free time to follow his real intellectual love: natural history. Darwin was a passionate student of nature, and while in school he amassed a considerable beetle collection as well as other specimens.\\"  One would think Christianity would have provided Comfort with a stronger sense of ethics.
1582701709|5.0|A must read....I don't know why I didn't read this book earlier than this! I could have been happy ALL my life::-)
1594203059|5.0|This is wide ranging look at all the forces that are vital to an understanding of our place as americans in this rapidly expanding world. The author does a thorough job explaining how China evolved from a long history of isolation into the capitalist power of today. Also an off beat look at america and what makes us what we are!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|If you grew up in the 80s like I did, then you know exactly what I'm talking about and knew what this was when you first saw a preview. I normally don't like movies that play on things from my childhood because they tend to butcher it but this was not the case. The movie was beautifully done. I loved the father/son relationship ... Watching it begin as something very strained to complete love and adoration. Not to mention the robot fights were awesome. I won't go into details but I loved everything about it.
0439023521|5.0|Wow! This was certainly no watered-down, Mormon-infused Y.A. novel like the \\"Twilight\\" series. I dislike the Y.A. tag as this book was so brutal throughout it is clearly not for young people. However, HUNGER GAMES reads like a teen-age version of Stephen Kings' RUNNING MAN or THE LONG WALK. It's a futuristic, post-apocalyptic America and the government punishes the surviving colonies by having them submit teen-agers every year into the Hunger Games.  These games are a last man standing, fight-to-the-death game of survival that is never short on surprises and gore. To top it all off, it is completely televised for the entertainment of the masses. When 16-year-old Katniss takes her 12-year-old sister Prim's place in the Hunger Games she has no idea what she has set herself up for.  Gripping to the very last page and full of dark images, social commentary and a great mockery of the sickening reality television craze and the mindless masses that follow it. Can't wait to see the movie!
B006M4F67A|1.0|It's hard for me to review this game because I can't find it on my Kindlefire. I need some help finding this game.
030746363X|5.0|I saw my sister over Christmas 2011 - 3 weeks later it looked as though she had lost 10+ pounds. I had to ask her - How did you do it? Her and her boyfriend had bought Ferriss' 4-Hour Body. That night I went home and bought it too. Now the beginning of February she has lost nearly 20 lbs and now on my 28th day I have lost 7.5 pounds which is great considering the diet is pretty easy to follow and considering I'm so busy - doing little exercise suites my life style perfectly. I have joined gyms, have had personal trainers and had diets before - but nothing has gotten me the results like this has. Awesome. Love it - and I can't wait to read another 150 pages to become superhuman.
B0025UHKNS|3.0|I received my Garmin 405cx about a week ago and used it on 3 runs of known distance measured by car odometer, as well as a trail run that distance markers. I consistently found that this watch was 10-15% short on the runs, which makes pacing inaccurate as well. It is very complicated to use, because it does have a lot of functions. The virtual training partner is a nice touch, but I had much better accuracy on roads and trails with my smartphone and mapmyrun. I considered trading it on on another Forerunner or Ironman Sport GPS watch but everyone says the same thing about needing ideal conditions for accuracy. Honestly, if these things aren't accurate consistently, why bother. Yesterday I did a 9.7 mile trail run that recorded at 8.4 with the forerunner. It was mostly sunny and not much foliage on the trees. I recommend people save their money and just get a free gps app on their smartphone that will be just as accurate.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|If you are a shy person who finds it difficult to communicate with new people then this book will be helpful. Peter Murphy presents conversation starters, explains body language and teaches you what to ask people when you first meet. This book contains simple strategies for entertaining conversations. With this book anyone should be able to survive a party or talk to strangers on a plane. I personally find that listening to people talk about their life is a good way to make people like you. Being a shy person by nature I found some of this book to be very useful. If you are an introvert I'd also recommend you read: [[ASIN:0761123695 The Introvert Advantage: How to Thrive in an Extrovert World]].<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
1592537251|5.0|This book suits the needs of everybody who likes to draw.  It provides beginners the initial push to confront the white paper by means of simple schemes. The tips of the selected artists - more than 100 - will speed up the learning process of anyone who wants to go further.  For those who already know how to draw, the book offers a collection of themes and approaches that will really be able to \\"open the mind\\" for new horizons. Based on the urban theme, one can have a broad range of techinques and be able to combine new formulas that have proven successful.  Thanks to the personality and the spirit of the author, who made a meritocratic selection of the artists presented, the book provides valuable \\"solutions\\" for almost all problems faced by an urban sketcher while trying to accomplish his task of selecting the most important information from the urban scene depicted. This is truly useful even for the most experienced sketchers.  Congratulations!

B0054JZC6E|4.0|super fun. beware it is very addicting. the games are dun and easy but gt more expensive the more you unlock. lots of ads just ignore them. four stars not five because of ads.
B000063Y8F|3.0|I have not used this product yet, because I am deciding whether to return it for FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I purchased this product SPECIFICALLY because the description said \\"made in USA\\". The actual item states made in CHINA! I have read reviews that another product is less expensive and works better. That one is also made in CHINA. If I am getting a genuine USA product, I'll gladly pay more for it, but if they are both CHINESE, then I'd assume spending less money. How irritating!!!
0525478817|5.0|If you don't mind having the insane urge to sob for approximately half of the book (which I did), then this is definitely a must read! I'm a consumer of literature and I have to say this truly is an amazing book! It's so honest, and relatable. The characters are so perfect (John Green is FAN-FRICKING-TASTIC) I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with Hazel. She is this witty (very sarcastic) 16 year old who happens to be living with a \\"touch of cancer\\" and crushingly it appears to be terminal...depressing, I know.  ANYWAYS...Hazel meets her intellectual & cancer-laden counterpart Augustus Waters. (FOR ME) without him this book wouldn't have worked, because AW is that person you would want to be if you had to deal with being a cancer patient, or really just in general. I want to be on a roller coaster that only goes up too! (READ THE BOOK, it sounds more official when AW says it) As their relationship develops, you the reader will get way too involved, it's just so personal and parts of this book really hurt, I found myself WAY too attached (Yes, even though the author gives the warning in the beginning, about how readers {LIKE ME}  tend to do that, so I'm thinking he's setting you up for failure the whole time, but I digress) It's a star crossed kind of thing, minus that part where they commit suicide and such (Of course they're setup for death naturally so...) I don't want to ruin it for anyone, and It only took me about 4 and a 1/2 hours to read (I COULDN'T STOP, and yeah I tried) BUT... In a Nutshell It's exactly how love should be, (at it's core) honest, hard, and un-ending. All great loves should be something like a Hazel & Gus love, but you'll have to read this lovely book to find all of that out. You won't be let down!!  Just remind yourself as you're crying, It's a FICTION, and get some tissues!

1451627289|4.0|I can't do a true review as yet because I haven't read it yet. I have collected all the hardbound editions from his book club for years is the main reason I bought it. ILL get around to it. I'm just hooked on nook at the moment and I didn't want to pay hard book price for the ebooks. As for Amazon, they've been great to deal with, I have kindle on my phone, so I'm reading two books at the same time now. Its nice to have the ability to get books from all over the web from Amazon straight to the kindle app.

0312427999|3.0|A funny thing happened when I first picked up Namoi Klein's 'The Shock Doctorine': I couldn't put it down. After months of reading thick, complicated books on Economics and Politics, always forcing myself through the drudgery of reading them because I wanted to educate myself for my own good, here at last was a book both compelling and entertaining. It's safe to say you will likely find it difficult to put 'The Shock Doctorine' down as well, and you will also find it nearly impossible to come out of the reading experience without being emotionally moved.  Therein lies the positive and negative aspects of Klein's magnum opus: It goes very deliberately for the heartstrings, and succeeds, but at the cost of rational objectivity. Is it an Economics lesson, or a piece of Political propaganda? Like a Michael Moore movie, it seems earnest and heartfelt as it pleads the case of the downtrodden, but has an incredibly single-minded viewpoint which it attempts to convince you of using every trick in it's arsenal. Klein will make you weep for poor people in the harshest of economic conditions, get angry and frustrated with their suffering and neglect at the hands of society, and then, once she's got under your skin, will point you at the boogeymen she believes to be responsible. Those bastards! Of course, there are other sides to the story, and Economic complications that Klein does not even attempt to touch on. Instead, she makes the very best case possible for her premise, and doesn't let silly things like fairness or objective analysis stand in her way.  I certainly can't deny the effectiveness of this approach, but I also can't wonder if it's also dishonest and irresponsible as well. I worry that, unlike me, many people will not put in the effort to get through the dryer, hard-to-read stuff that is required to really understand other viewpoints, and will instead consume, 'The Shock Doctorine' alongside their Harry Potter and Dan Brown novels, and come away thinking their emotional affectedness is proof of Economic truth. Such is the purpose of propaganda, after all. Hmmm...you'd think as much as Naomi Klein seems to want to stand as a champion of \\"the masses\\", she should have a little more respect for them than to write a book aimed at exploiting their emotions for her own gain.
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|As usual, Amazon.com's pricing on this movie was fantastic.  Video quality...absolutely stunning.  Sound quality...totally immersing.  The discs were loaded with bonus features, and all of them were fun to watch.  I'm still getting used to Ultraviolet though, and I would've just preferred the old iTunes digital copy.  However, if you even remotely like Harry Potter, buy this, and you won't regret it.

I was also.happy to know you can download a Bible version so if you are not at a.wick location you can still use the app.
B00338QENI|5.0|I am a 2nd year science student and I couldn't help myself when I saw this book on the shelf.  This book is thoroughly engrossing, enlightening, and overall fantastic!! I am now recommending it to everyone because I feel that we should all know not only Henrietta's contribution to the world, but her story.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|If you're one of the \\"Fast and Furious\\" types then stay away. Drive is meant to be absorbed, so if your ADHD gets in the way, go put on your favorite Michael Bay flick, because this is the complete opposite.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|lots of fun. wish could get more games. the ones they have range from easy to challenging with something force everyone.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some games are fun and others are a waste of time. I like how you get points just for playing. But it's sure not the last game I am going to get. There are more games I don't like than I do like.
0060873027|4.0|Loved it.  A fascinating view of the world through an 'other -dimensional' lens.  MICRO is an absorbing industrial-espionage adventure story in which some of the characters are passed through a technologically-engineered- space-portal to become microscopic in size. Imagine yourself as a microscopic-sized human facing an ordinary sized wasp, caterpillar, or poisonous beetle and you have a small glimpse of the adventures that face the micro-human.  As a coach and author of a book on human evolution from a three-dimensional, rational perception of reality to a more intuitive expanded multi-dimensional state, I was intrigued to read a fictionalized version of dimensional change.  Granted Crighton's depiction is not what I see unfolding, but it does catalyze the reader to consider new ways of perceiving and to explore the process of coping as we humans become more and more energetic and less and less physically dense. In this blend of science and fiction, MICRO is Michael Crichton at his best.  I highly recommend it.
